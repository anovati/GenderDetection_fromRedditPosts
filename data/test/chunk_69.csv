Plus the story is ridiculous, he just whips his cock out, brings her to the bathroom and does the deed but apparently gently enough so that the rape kit can not prove that a rape occurs. The girl does not end up pressing any charges? 

The woman was looking for the pay day. If you are bouncing around from bar to bar with a NFL QB, he isn't going to rape you, you are going to let him fuck you. Simple enough."

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1390529275.0,"Not really, presumably you're going to be running four ragemongers in a tribal deck, and the advantage that the reckoner has is that it's purely Colored mana to cast. So the ragemongers can stack them to a zero casting cost, unlike any other minotaur. So with a multi ragemongers draw prior to turn four, the reckoner becomes more and more attractive. Because of the lack of one drops, or effective two drops in a tribal deck, the odds of having the game well and truly sewn up on turn four is slim. Even with one ragemonger on turn three, it opens the door for a two reckoner play on the next turn, and it also drops the cost of another ragemonger to one colorless mana. Using the ragemongers ability to drop the cost of your next creature is no more of a ""win more"" move than chaining BTEs.

Edit: a ""win more"" scenario is more along the lines of:

Turn three: ragemonger.

Turn four: 2x ragemongers, 4x boros reckoners.

Turn five: cast homing lightning on your reckoners for 16 damage to the opponent.

Turn four is setting up a win, but turn five with the lighting is a gratuitously complicated move that only works in the face of an overwhelmingly advantageous board state."

NanoNarse,unitedkingdom,1390529395.0,"What I'm trying to get it isn't that overqualified applicants are always rejected out of principle. They sometimes are, but like I said before, it's usually an extra hurdle. Not only do you have to be the best applicant available, but also better by such a margin that the employer will overlook their fears about your degree. That's a lot to ask.

I'm a very attractive retail candidate and even I found it difficult getting an interview. Heck, I lucked out at GAME. They were a small store hiring 4 people and got 600 applications. So they just invited everyone to giant group interviews and invited the best 10 to one-on-one interviews later. They didn't look at my application until I'd already impressed them in the group stage. Starbucks overlooked it because they have a culture of young employees with high staff turnover. It's less of an issue for them. But I've also seen my manager reject others for being overqualified so I'm not particularly reassured.

Employers fears aren't unreasonable, either. Graduates don't want to be there. They're looking to move on and up the ladder. I am too. I turned down a promotion at Bux two months ago because next week I go part time to start my Masters. How can I blame employers for being wary?

4- I like sleep. 

5- I am grossed out by bodily fluids and how they always seem to be sticky. 

6- I like sex. A lot. And kids interfere with that. 

7- I have a boyfriend who I want to spend all my spare time and attention on him, rather than a little crying sack of confusion and frustration

8- Pregnancy would be hellish for me, and it honestly freaks me out

9- I fear that I would not be the kind of parent I would want to be, that I wouldn't meet my own standards as a mother

10- I don't want the aftermath of pregnancy, hormonal, physical, emotional, or mental- I don't want decreased sex drive, I don't want decreased capacity to enjoy sex, I don't want to be stressed and tired and depressed constantly, and I REALLY don't want to be a ""mommy""- I don't want to become what I most detest, the self-righteous ""I've made a huge mistake but my brain won't let me accept that so I'm going to make sure everyone knows how happy I am (even though I'm not)""

Those two weren't too bad, compared to what I've seen other people do, and it all ended in 2 weeks (seemed like forever!) It wasn't fun. I ended it by choosing and declaring I was going to date 1 of them and not the other.  That REALLY sucked, because I was close to both of them.  The other guy took it in stride and things ended peaceably, thank God!

So I always thought it was an awful thing to do.  And then I learned first hand that my gut reaction was right.  It threatened to happen again maybe 2 years ago, but I nipped that in the bud, luckily.  I was very afraid one of the guys who was interested in me would try to physically fight for me....which is not cool.  That's really middle school, and even in middle school I'd find that childish.

Funnily enough, I do know someone who loves seeing girls compete for his attention.  I've known him for a while, he's a friend of my sister.  There's always a bunch of women following him around and heavy handedly flirting with him.  What's weird is, the girls seem to have formed some kind of ... fan base?  I don't know how else to describe it!  They compete against each other for his attention but if one girl DOES get more attention, they turn on her in a snap.  There was one night recently where my sister left a party with him and he drove her home.  He's been doing that for years, he's a nice guy.  As soon as they got in the car, his phone started blowing up with texts from the ""fans"", saying omg how could you go home with that Asian girl!?  And weird stuff like that.

To us, his friends, he'll sigh and shrug and be like, what can ya do?  This is my life.  But it's been years and it's now looking like he secretly adores the attention they give him.  I guess he likes feeling wanted?"

I don't know where the idea that only presidents could be on our bills came from(maybe I made it up myself based on observations, or some adult who wasn't thinking past $20 told me so when I was a young child), but I'm almost certain that's where the idea came from, for me at least.

EDIT: I have to say that I had high school US history when I was 11~, due to being homeschooled, so it's not quite as bad as I made it sound at first.  Still, 11 isn't a little kid.  I really don't know how the idea got stuck in my head, but it embedded itself pretty deep."

The way I see it, I don't want to miss doing moves.  If every time I did Max Interval Pylo, I crashed after the first round of Level 3 Drills, I would miss the 45 seconds of whatever is next and not get to work that muscle group.  My main rule is to never pause during a circuit.  

Also, sometimes you need a rest.  I think it's better to take an extra 10 - 30 seconds, regain your composure, and keep proper form than to jump in, flail around for a bit, and injure yourself because you lost control.  I think Shaun T would rather see me doing High Knee Obliques properly than see me barely getting my knees up and not using my core.

You will feel behind pretty soon if you don't start thinking about it. Experiment, but don't do it willy-nilly. Do it in order to learn about yourself.

Meet with your career advising office a few times before the end of the year and actively start thinking about what you want to do. Don't wait for an epiphany because it may never come. Spare yourself the panic of being a senior and not knowing what you wanted.

Make friends with grad students and upperclassmen so that you can get their guidance. Even if you don't directly ask them for advice, they can serve as examples of what kinds of directions you can go. 

Don't be an overachiever with your class load. Be realistic about what you will be able/willing to put in the work for. In high school, you get recognized for being an overachiever; in college, more likely it just hurts you. Each professor only cares about how you do in his/her class, not in what else you are good at. Pick classes that allow you to have a balanced schedule. If you have a bunch of classes on one day, you'll end up with tests and assignments on the same day as well. 

Hang out with people as much as possible in the first semester, especially the first few weeks of college. It will get harder and harder to make friends as time goes on. 

Get a job in a library or a similar job that allows you to do your homework while you work. Go in person to inquire in addition to sending in your application. Or better yet, ask a friend to recommend you. These jobs are in high demand, so they may never look at your application.

Just because you can test out of a class with AP credit doesn't mean you should. If you're a chem major and you qualify to skip general chem, for instance, you might regret doing so later when you realize that people who took gen chem were much more prepared for the higher level classes. Ask around and see what people recommend, but I would say if you need to know the material for future classes, don't test out of the class. 

Go to class. Skipping class is a pernicious habit and it starts to feel ok because everyone is doing it...but it will hurt you. Be strict with yourself.

It's definitely different - even if you guys stay over at each other's places all the time and seem to get along super well, it's a hugeeee difference when you actually live together.  It's surprising how different things really are.

And I have to echo everyone else in here that you might want to slow down a bit.  You should be talking about moving in because it seems like the right time, not just because you want to move and it seems logical.  Plus, you're in the early stages of a relationship still, and things could change in 6 months.  Hell, things can change when she turns 21.

Plus, how are you going to work moving in together?  Is it going to be a place that you alone could afford but the two of you could split together?  Because if not, that's a poor choice.  Let's say you sign a 1 year lease - think about the pressure on the relationship.  It's not just staying together because you want to and it feels like you should, it's also staying together so you guys don't get fucked on your living arrangement. You don't want to be in a situation where the house/apartment/whatever is part of what's keeping you together.  If a breakup is necessary, then you need to be able to do that without fucking up your life.  And sure, that could happen in any relationship, but think of it like opening a restaurant - no matter how good it seems, it has a higher chance of failing in the beginning, but if it's open for long enough, it has a much higher success rate.

Rerichael,gainit,1390529679.0,"I don't think I'm the most qualified, but I do think I have something to offer.

1. I'm fairly knowledgeable about gaining.My journey is far from over, but my progress has been steady. I know enough about beginning programs and diet needs to have an informed discussion with most of my peers. Currently a college student, and I like to think I'm most knowledgeable about gaining while on a budget/at a dining hall, mainly because I live it every day. Also, I think that college is where broscience lives, and a lot of guys who are starting out are late highschool/early college, so I think I give pretty good advice coming from personal experience in dealing with the ""gymbro talk""

2. I'm fairly familiar with the community. I used to LIVE on this sub when I was starting out, trying to suckle every little piece of advice I could. I've recently faded, but I'd peg that on the ""untidyness"" of the sub that was the reason for this mod search in the first place.

3. I haven't been responding to advice posts recently, because usually the questions are very basic, and I don't feel the need to comment on a post that has 15 other users telling the OP to read the FAQ. However, I also frequent MFA, among other subs, and I always offer some advice to kids who want their clothes to fit better. I'd have to dig a little, but I could give you some examples if you'd like.

4. Like I said before, not recently super active, but with the change, I would have no problem being a frequent commenter. I can mod most every day. Usually during the early afternoon to maybe 1 or 2am Central Time. My work/school schedule this semester leaves me with a lot of free time in the afternoon. I'm on Reddit ALL the time now.

5./6. No previous Reddit modding experience, but I was an admin of a forum LONG time ago. No CSS experience unfortunately.

7. Basically, I want to mod gainit, because this is where I got my start becoming the person who I wanted to be, and the opportunity to change this sub for the better would be such an honor. I think I'd do a well enough job as a team member representing our sub not only to our current members, but to potential new members from other subs. I have no problem with helping out newbies. 

Again, I don't think I'm the most qualified for the position, but I am someone who's willing to help out in the duties."

I've known her since childhood.  She was protective of me when we were little, and now that she's a doctor she's protective of her mom...whose health was sadly decimated after huge bouts of antibiotics.  She doesn't let people's rage get to her anymore.  Not sure if that is because she grew up or because of constant exposure to that, since she's a doctor.

If you're interested in the facts of what he did do, they are as follows:

* Hired someone whom he referred to as a consultant that the NCAA deemed to be an extra coach which put USC over the limit for coaches.
* Lobbied for internships to be given to three USC athletes at a sports marketing company. Athletes having paid internships is not frowned on by the NCAA, but they don't like it when people associated with the university uses their leverage to get their players opportunities that should be open to others on a level playing field.

If I was free on my birthday without any social obligations, I would try to do something I have not tried out before.

I would take the day off (which may not possible for everyone). I have never taken a dance class before so I will probably go for one in the afternoon or early evening.

Maybe later on I will drive to some good part of the town that I have never been before. I don't know about you but I don't think I have seen the whole city in which I live in.

I am not the artsy type so museums are not my thing. But it is my birthday damnit, I have to try something new. I will go to some boring art presentation thing or whatever they call it and just talk to people.

I would also try some new cuisine. I have had Thai, Indian and Indonesian before. I wonder what Ethiopian or Brazilian food tastes like. Alright, lets try that out. Maybe my stomach will implode the next day so better give the boss a heads up. (""Hey, I am eating something new today, alone. I might die, perhaps because of the food or just get plain mugged and murdered. Might not come tomorrow"").

After a light dinner (LOL), I will go to the damn bar and order a fancy lady drink. Something sugary and colorful (I like colors), because I am a man damnit and I don't need a drink to confirm my masculinity. I will announce to the bartender that it is my birthday. He will look at me with pity because I am alone and I might get a free drink. I hope some gay guy hits on me.

I would make a point not to get drunk, just slightly buzzed. Ask any girl for a dance. Use the birthday card. If I get shot down, not a problem. Today is my birthday and a blatant rejection and humiliation does not affect me today. Because it is my birthday. I would make a point to not hit on said girl because I just want to dance and the girl is an end to my means. (At this point, I guess I am more than buzzed because I am mixing up my sentences.) A pawn in my plans. A mere tool in the big picture. Yes, this girl is a tool.

I don't know what else I should do. Well, you know what. Next year when you have your birthday, call me. We will figure something out."

No. It isn't. The question is whether I have the right to not die in pregnancy if I know it's a significant risk.

&gt; There is only one logical reason to have an abortion. And that is when another life is also at risk - namely the mother's - and you're forced to choose.

So. Some abortion is ok?

How do you define life at risk? Is that only for medical conditions?

People calling me a slut, whore, cum dumpster, etc. for getting pregnant so young. I was buying some diapers a while ago, and got asked if I knew who the father was, since ""teenagers these days are so crazy and wild"". I went for a walk with my daughter some weeks ago and some guys kept shouting at me that they wanted to be my ""baby daddy"". Had a friend's friend tell me she felt ""so sorry for me"" after I told her my boyfriend(and baby's father) had to start working as a construction worker when I got pregnant, since that job is ""so lower class"".

applewagon,AskWomen,1390530768.0,"**Tip**: The best Valentine's Day gift that I ever received was a mixed tape from my boyfriend. I had told him months back that I always wanted one back from when I was a preteen listening to Bright Eyes. So he spent a day making a tape that told our story chronologically: a song from the first concert we went to (our first date), the song we always danced to when we were blacked out in college, a song from the album we both loved in December 2010, etc;. I listen to it all the time and it always makes me smile.


**Tip for the ladies:** Best lingerie I ever wore were those thigh rise stockings. I wore them out to dinner on Valentine's Day and let my boyfriend sneak a peak to show that they weren't just tights. They're a pain in the ass and a half to keep up, but he went crazy. "

fnredditacct,sex,1390530840.0,"The mental ""strange"" and ""out of body"" sound very much like it could be subspace.

(Subspace for me can vary, probably I should be more actuate and use different words for the different mental states I feel, but don't have that vocab handy at the moment.)

Generally, though, they feel very...animal? I lose sense of time, and all high reasoning functions, speech is a completely foreign thing. 

I am both just a body and completely in the moment, and also disconnected from my body and in a quiet staticy world outside of it.

Your boyfriend, I think, reacted very well when you freaked out. Good for him.

Losing the ability to speak is fairly common, and what works best for me is to also have a physical ""safeword."" I have a few that I like. ""Tap out"" (quick *taptap*) works really well for any kind of rough play or resistance play. When I am gagged, or restrained I like holding something heavyish in one hand that I throw or just drop if I need to safeword.

I recommend having something like these in place next time. That way you don't need to be scared and resist going back to that headspace for fear of losing your safeword.

Now, with that drier stuff out of the way, Congrats on this!! This is a really exciting thing, (for me), to play with. I hope you can continue to have fun with it!!"

wolfkin,AskMen,1390530877.0,"girls learn they attract men when they turn 13. Guys don't get that. I'm not saying it's all good. But it does generate a reality of attractability for women that men don't have.

The social narrative is hugely focused on women's attraction. The shift towards 6-pack abs and hot guys is rather new relatively.

90% of girls get hit on. Most of them know that even if they don't look like models they're still going to get hit on. Dudes... we don't get that. You either look like the models and get hit on all the time or you don't and don't. Regardless of actual attraction the difference is that dudes are socially trained to ask out girls and not the other way around. It creates this power dynamic where if a guy doesn't ask out girls then he's not getting any romance and thus we think girls aren't attracted to us. You could even look at it like guys are finally getting the message about not hounding women all the time but that's leaving them in this romantic bubble because no one taught the girls to be assertive."

I go about things differently in my relationships and have different expectations, and it is always emotionally jarring when someone does not feel the same, or places less value on the relationship than you thought they did. My fear of that caused me to ignore the fact that he is justified in having his preferences.

Example 1: I was sick of the dirty wood pile out next to our back door during winter. It would spread out, causing trips and stubbed toes. A few weeks back I just finished making a rather large trunk out of pallet wood to house the logs. No more trips and is much tidier, plus it serves as a shelf to use when cooking on the BBQ.

Example 2: We have an old-ish CRT tv in our bedroom which is only hooked up to a bluray player, no antenna. It's sitting on our old baby-change table (with a few modifications) in a built-in wardrobe. It looks ugly. I decided that the full 1080p lcd monitor that is about to become spare in a month could surely serve as a tv. I go and spend $6 on a DVI to HDMI cable and test my theory. It works. Plus the monitor has speakers, so I can use an RCA to headphone cable I had lying around for that. I just need to make a hanging monitor &amp; bluray player out of pallet wood and we'll have a better &amp; bigger picture, less power consumption, and more space available in the wardrobe."

CVTHIZZKID,fireemblem,1390531139.0,"Probably Tomebreaker. It allows you to avoid most magic damage (except somewhat rare magic weapons), so it can be a decent replacement if the unit has a low resistance stat. The same is not true for the others because everything else deals physical damage.

Which ones you want depend a lot on the current class of the unit. Flying Units are a lot safer with bowbreaker, and any mounted units/Taguels benefit a lot from Lancebreaker to deal with enemies wielding Beast Killer Lances. If the unit can only wield one type of Melee weapon, possessing the breaker skill for your weakness on the weapon triangle is highly beneficial. 

The problem is that each breaker skill is not necessarily given to the class that needs it the most. Getting the skills you want onto your units is a lot easier in the children's generation, but the children typically have a lot more options to work with, and breaker skills are decent but not the top tier.  

And my previous post was mistaken; Sorcerer gets Tomebreaker, not Dark Knight. Sorry, I'll edit it. "

LasherDeviance,AskReddit,1390531179.0,"Nope. Benghazi is a big deal. She left other Americans to fend for themselves and get killed. Also let's look at it from another point of view. Her husband cheated on her, granted, you should stand by his side during his term, but after, she should have divorced him. It shows that she's only in it for the fame and title and of course the history books. She's not strong enough. 

I'm GOP, and I stand behind my president regardless of if I favor his poilcies or not as an American, but how can we expect to Hillary to keep her country in line and delegate, when she, 

1.) Dropped out of being a employee of the current prez after him giving her a high-level job after him beating her in the primaries. Only to spite him.

 2.) She can't keep her own husband in line, *while he was already president!* He got jawed-off by a chick that wasn't even attractive! 

Also stats say that women usually vote for who their husband votes for. And with the current president being Black, such as myself, even though I am a conservative, a Caucasian male or a Black GOP male will be the next president of the US.

We have another 10-15 years before a woman candidate will be viable for the position, and she will definitely be a GOP candidate first.

Megamind has an evil lair with tons of gadgets, vehicles, and weapons, each he knows how to use, and he likely doesn't have to take longer to develop things. he also has his army of brain bots, plus his gorilla-armed fish sidekick who I'm sure could kick Moist's ass easily.

Dr. Horrible lives in a small apartment, with a smaller lair than Megamind, and doesn't even like killing. he's evil by the end of the movie, but he still doesn't like killing. the whole event with Penny was just an accident. Also, I'm sure Dr. Horrible has a budget that he has to stay within to develop anything (it also seemed like it took a while to develop one small death ray) while Megamind and Minion can easily get more Tesla coils and blinky dials from that outlet store in Romania. I also don't think that Dr. Horrible's freeze ray would even work that well against Megamind, even if he had a month to perfect it. now, if he got it up so that it affected a wide area, he could pick off Megamind with his death ray, but that seems to be the only scenario I can think of where he wins

It wasn't at all difficult for me to say I wanted NSA, because I felt no shame for (1) not wanting a relationship or (2) engaging in sex before marriage.

(1) Can trip up more people than you might think. Admitting you want sex outside of a relationship is admitting that you don't want a relationship. And OF COURSE, you're supposed to want a relationship, right?!

But also, I don't view my sexuality, or sex acts, at a commodity. I don't look at it as something that can be wasted. So I am not ""wasting my time"" or ""wasting my youth"" or ""wasting my sex"" by engaging in sex outside of a relationship. Sex doesn't have to be ""an investment in a relationship"" to me.

Some people that don't mind sex outside of marriage can have trouble with sex outside of a relationship, because they view sex as an asset only to be used when properly invested.

But I become uncomfortable with that idea because it treats my sexual experiences as a commodity. 

And I don't like that. 

To me, they are  MY experiences that I have the pleasure of enjoying with another. NOT something I give to someone else.

Just being there, you feel the energy and the live impact of the music; it's incredibly beautiful and at times, near overwhelming.

Lets see the list:

**Porter Robertson** 2012 (I believe). Fun night.

**Veld 2012, Day 1**

- Chris Lake
- Michael Woods
- Steve Aoki. I still love hearing ""Come with me"" and ""Turbulence"", kinda overplayed though
- Steve Angelo, enjoyed his performance
- Deadmau5. The Veldt will always hold a place in my heart. Loved his set.

All the predominant ones I remember.

**Veld 2012, Day 2**

- Aly &amp; Fila. Absolutely LOVED their set (or was it only Fila?). The tent sucked though.
- Cosmic Gate. Crazy as always
- Avicii. Was ok.....

Kinda regretted not seeing Gareth Emery, but what can you do when your friend is freaking out due to mixing drugs (don't mix drugs!).

**Steve Aoki, 2012** On my birthday! Was ok, not the same feel as at Veld.

**Zedd, 2012** meh, wasn't feeling his set so much. But I did jam out with a bunch of cool people (always a plus).

**Swedish House Mafia, 2013** Enjoyed the hell out of it! Met lots of cool people, jammed for the whole set.

**Sensation Canada 2013** Loved this event! Some people say it wasn't as good as they thought it could have been (understandably so, with the price so high), but you best believe I danced my ass off! Enjoyed every single minute of it!

- Mr. White
- 2000 and one
- Sunnery James &amp; Ryan Marciano
- Eric Prydz. **FUCKING EPIC!**
- Otto knows
- MC Gee

**Veld 2013, Day 1** Just recently got into gloving, so this was my first time with them (before I only glow sticked/liquid). BLEW PEOPLE's MINDS with my amateur skills. Been glovin ever since. All about the smiles and making those lights sing :)  

- Krewella, was ok....
- Dirty South. Pretty live for what I stayed for (had to head back to the hotel to check in, unfortunately).
- Steve Aoki. Not as good this time. [Epic cake throw, though](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uQEqXpA2N0).
- Kaskade. CRAZY!!! Loved it!
- Above &amp; Beyond. Unforgettable, spectacular. Simply incredible.

**Veld 2013, Day 2** Drunken haze for most of the afternoon, met some amazing people though when I lost my friends!

- Dada Life
- Steve Angello. Was good, not the same as before.
- Deadmau5. Once again, LOVED HIS SET, Still loved The Veldt (was also holding this girl I liked too, which added to the effect).

**BT, Alex M.O.R.P.H. , 2013** Absolutely INSANE! Lots of cool people, fun time.

**Adrian Lux, Audien , 2013** Loved it, met lots of cool people.

**Moguai, 2014** Amazing show, once again lots of cool people.

Future events I plan on going:

**Dash Berlin, 2014** Can't wait. What really sold it to me was this [video](http://youtu.be/z-T4z4uzAkI).

**Armin Only, 2014** First time seeing Armin van Buuren. Too stoked.

As you may have noticed, I love meeting new people. What can I say, music brings people together. Where there's people, there will be music or song.


Adding on to concerts/shows (even though they aren't raves, or electronic in general)

- Classified, 2013
- Talib Kweli, Rich Kidd, 2013
- Dilated Peoples, 2013
- Daniel Champagne, 2013 (during Buskerfest)
- Swollen Members, 2013
- Sonreal, 2013
- Shad (Going to seem him Jan. 31, 2014)

I was taking it personally. I read his comments and knew that I would immediately walk away if I met him because 1) that is diving into things far too fast and I am usually slower with the emotional aspect (the talking about if we continue dating expectation) and 2) I do not like the idea of someone forcing their preferences upon me without holding a discussion. Use of a condom or not is not a bad habit that needs to be improved, it is a personal preference with some sort of basis/justification behind it. 

I switched everything he was saying in my head. For example, I like hair. If I am physically attracted to my SO's hair, that does not mean I am going to dump them 5 years later when they start to go bald. To me, that is not at all important in regards to who they are as a person, which is hopefully why I am with them. 

You liked all of my comments a lot, I am noticing, and sorry that I will not take the time to respond to all of them. Just know that I acknowledge that I was a bit too hasty with judgment and took it far too personally. In dating me, I would view that deal breaker statement as being ""wrong"" and a cause for me to leave, but that is certainly not the case for every person, and I am sure, if non-use of condoms is that important to him, he will one day find someone who is on the same page.

nicholasferber,AskMen,1390531646.0,"I don't think I would want my wife to be a stay at home mom indefinitely. Maybe for a year or two, but then I would like her to go back to work.

Being a stay at home parent is a big task. You need to be really passionate and positive about it. It takes a lot of effort. You need to be really good at management, prioritization and be able to plan ahead. You have to foresee a lot of things, both in long term and short term.

For eg. your kid has a particular velocity and a particular probability matrix to change its velocity. Is it going to split open its head on the table or is it going to stab itself? Is it going to be in a train accident in the near future? What kind of career do you think it will gravitate towards? What skills does it lack which might become its weakness? How do you make it develop certain skills which it does not have an aptitude for?

Being a stay at home parent is a tough job. It takes a toll on you physically and emotionally. You need to be sharp at all times.

I do not want my wife to go through all of that. The constant thinking, planning and preventing disasters. I would like to find a way to share that responsibility. I also want her to earn money so that she does not feel dependent on me so that she can go out and buy crappy clothes and bullshit bags every month without feeling guilty or without having the need to ask me if she should be spending what she might feel as *my* money. I fear that she might lose touch with the outside world because when you are a stay at home parent, you are doing a project for at least 20 years and the topic of the project is right in front of you 24 7.

I do wish that I could make a clone of myself and so that I can plan and execute things that parents do. Research different approaches to whatever I need to do as a parent, optimize said approaches. But I do not think it is possible for one person to do it without losing their minds and in effect losing or affecting a significant part of relationship with their significant other.

I am just a guy who does not know how to handle parenthood, but I think that making one person be so close to it will not be in my wife's, mine or my kid's best interests because while they might be neglected a little bit, they would thrive the most under emotionally not-drained parents.

I do not think that you are making the wrong decision (and I am sure you are not doubting yourself if that sounded presumptuous). There is no right or wrong in parenthood because we all have our own reasons for our approaches to it. However, what I have written is mine and that is what you asked for, is it not?"

I usually do more than 7 minutes (restart the workout after it ends) and I also add to the suggested exercises. It gives a good framework, though.

It's just such a damaging social change, and given that the percentage of men who also happen to be paedophiles is pretty tiny, it's just insane to think that so many men are being put off working with children or even attracting suspicion for wanting to work with them just because people think there is actually a realistic chance of them abusing children because they're male.

Instead of this fear culture, a healthier approach would be to install better ways for children to report abuse, and education to teach them what to do if an adult does something that makes them feel uncomfortable. It just seems to me that while this is an incredibly complex issue, the way the world is dealing with it is insane and completely counter-productive."

Cream cheese has some carbs, so be careful if you're already carb heavy. If almonds are available, try those instead of the peanuts. Make fat bombs if you have access to a communal kitchen or a mini fridge freezer- bribe someone with a car to take you to the store to get snacks and fat bomb supplies. I made mine with what I had in the pantry, so they are more calorie heavy than preferred, but I'm going to go shopping for more supplies and make 100 cal ones next week. They are very filling though, and get me through my morning classes. Filch a cup of half and half or cream (not plain milk!) from your campus coffee shop whenever you can and use that in tea/coffee/salad dressings..etc. I make a high fat salad dressing with goats milk yogurt, olive oil, salt, pepper, spice to taste, and heavy cream.

TofuRobber,INTP,1390532023.0,"That's normal. I get like that all the time during summer and winter breaks where I have absolutely no plans and am complexly free. I can do whatever I want but won't feel like doing anything I really want to do. The trick to get out of the slump is to give yourself an obligation to do something. 

Do something that you may or may not want to do. Take out the trash. Clean the house Go out for a walk. Go buy groceries. Go visits some friends. Read that book you've been meaning to finish. Watch that movie you wanted to see. Do it. That's really the hardest part but once you start it gets easier.

The best thing that helps is getting out of a routine that you've set up for yourself. Do something, anything, to give yourself a change in your daily life and you'll find yourself less bored. A simple change of location may be all that you need. If you're reading a book, read on your bed, read in the living room, read outside your home, read at the park, or wherever.  

What I've learned about myself is that although I hate obligations (to others) because it limits my choices, I'm absolute useless without them. If all I care/have to worry about is myself then I won't feel like doing anything and become an empty drone. Once I have to do something for somebody else I feel the need to work hard on it even if it's menial tasks. I.e. although I can enjoy solitude I feel that my life is meaningless if I can't be of use to others.

This might not be your situation but it might help."

Afeni02,gainit,1390532067.0,"&gt;I remember years ago when I first started working out and posting here I went out and put together a program all on my own. I thought it through very thoroughly and was very proud of myself when I'd finished. I made a new thread about it and asked for people to critique it in the title. I expected for the most part people would approve of it and might offer tiny suggestions to improve on it.
What I got was people telling me it was awful and I needed to scrap it completely and pick up a pre-made program which was created by someone who was an expert in the weightlifting/strength training or bodybuilding field.
I was upset and annoyed at the time, however it was sound advice. They were right. My program sucked, I did not know what I was doing and if I'd followed it I wouldn't have made any significant long-term gains.
Ask yourself this: Do you know more than Mark Rippetoe, Bill Starr or anyone who has studied strength and hypertrophy training for years and has had countless more years of empirical evidence to refine their knowledge on how to make progress in the gym? (The answer is, of course, ""no"").
Then why would you use some program you've made over one of theirs?

steve496,49ers,1390532328.0,"CB is probably the 49ers biggest need, so I can imagine us trading up for one; however, this price seems too high to me.  Looking at the [standard trade value chart](http://www.draftcountdown.com/features/Value-Chart.php), picks 20 + 50 are worth 1250 points, while 30 + 56 + 61 + 77 is 1463 points. I can't see the 49ers going for that - particularly since, as deep as this year's draft class is, I think the extra 2nd and 3rd round picks are more valuable than usual.

For comparison: last year, the 49ers gave up picks 31 and 74 to get to 18 for Eric Reid, and that was a shallower class. By giving up 30 and 77, I'd expect us to be able to get to at *least* 20th and probably a couple places higher while still keeping both our 2nd rounders to fill other needs.  I think we'd much rather do that then the trade you propose.

What is your scene?  

What kind of food do you like?

What do you like to do?

What days of the week are you going to be in town? [ looks like you said first week of March] - 

* Texas Independence Day is Sunday March 2nd, Republic of Texas on the River Walk will have drink specials.  
* Monday you have swing night at Sam's Burger Joint for swing dancing.
* Tuesday you have Downtown Tuesdays which a local thing to get more locals hanging out in downtown.
Wednesday  - go to the San Antonio Museum of Art and check out the Samurai exhibit. 
* I could go on but just let us know what you like to do.

Just like with any other downtown in major cities, don't go where there are no lights.  Always call in advance for a cab...blah blah do all the things that dad says to do.  

Give us a little more information on what you like to do, and we can help a lot more. "

citadel_lewis,askphilosophy,1390532390.0,"&gt;&gt;&gt;Depends on what you mean by private.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you want the mind to be 'essentially transparent', existing technology is not there yet.

&gt;&gt;Exactly. So the statement ""the mind is blatantly not private"" is false. Thanks for clearing that up.

&gt;Logic doesn't work that way.  If you don't have a definition of 'private', the statement 'the mind is blatantly not private' is meaningless, not false.

We do. I asked your friend to define it and he chose to use a phrase I wrote in a different context. It's not my fault he's unhappy with his decision now.

&gt;Further, you have produced a rather strange definition of 'privacy' through your requirement that it be 'essentially transparent'.  That seems a rather extreme requirement for privacy to be violated that is not reflected in other usages.

Your privacy is violated if the thing you are trying to keep private is made transparent. That's not very strange at all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you really mean something like  ['a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you'](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1ve8r7/all_looking_for_examples_of_the_word_know_meaning/ceslz5b) , what we have so far seems to have punched a sizable hole through your exclusivity, both in control and experience.

&gt;&gt;That's not what I mean.

&gt;Nobody is asserting that you defined 'privacy' that way.

Yes, you are:

&gt; If you really mean something like  ['a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you'](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1ve8r7/all_looking_for_examples_of_the_word_know_meaning/ceslz5b)

Don't be disingenuous.

&gt;However, it is a property **you** ascribed to the mind.

Yes, a property of the mind is not the same thing as the definition of privacy.

&gt;&gt;That was your mate's definition of privacy.

&gt;You can reject that such a property can be reasonably *denoted* by privacy, but if you claim that you did not *invoke* that property that he used 'privacy' to denote, then you are lying.

I invoked that property of the mind before the concept of privacy was even mentioned. So what?

&gt;&gt;I don't think privacy is contingent on self-control.

&gt;But you apparently think the mind is.

Sense of self. Once again, a sense of self is not the same thing as the mind as a whole. "

I have to agree that the Fire Emblem series is a great one to get into that you can get very cheap. Izuna: Legend of the Unemployed Ninja is not for 3DS specifically (DS) but is funny, challenging, and an interesting take on dungeon-crawling (not sure if it's on the Nintendo eShop).

So today at work, I met with an interior designer to pick out some colors for our office. I'm the office manager. My boss (who is arguably the most difficult man...ever) swans in 25 minutes late and looks at the colors (agreed on like 3 weeks ago by everyone in the office) and makes a face. I'm thinking, ""oh here we go....""

""I don't like this."" Dude, it's blues, greens, and dove grey. There is no way to feel passionate dislike towards a light silvery blue. There just isn't. ""What about, like, yellow? Or red?"" He pointed out a hideous mustardy-butter yellow and swans out, as the designer literally *sticks her finger down her throat and pretends to puke*. He pointed out a couple of other primary freaking colors that belong on a child's wall later. 

I ended up doing my best to sell him on a deep blue accent wall...BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS A 100SQ FT BRIGHT TEAL OFFICE WITH NO WINDOWS. "

michaelnoir,AskReddit,1390532678.0,"I don't think it's quite true to say that the Nazis wanted a ""Utopia"". They wanted a thousand-year Reich with themselves as a master race ruling Europe. That's not quite the same thing. 

Also, it was not inspired by ""progressive Utopianism"". It was inspired first and foremost by nationalism and militarism. It was reactionary, not progressive. There were plenty of elements within it that were fully in keeping with German history, such as the territorial expansion and the anti-Semitism. One need only look at the Nazi's attitude to things like art, music and the position of women to see that they were not ""progressives"", but fanatical nationalists, ""radical traditionalists"" if that's not too weird a term. 

Fascism is not the logical conclusion of ""progressive Utopianism"" but simply the logical conclusion of nationalism. 

The Weimar Republic, who came before the Nazis and whom they despised, would be a lot more ""progressive"" in today's terms.

the second one changed the fighting system and the ""spell"" system as well as the level up system. For the better, although i didn't like the fighting. The plot is good, but it wasn't close enough to the book for my taste. A big minus in my opinion was that they put less monsters in it and too many of them they became to repetitive and annoying. Also the sword system became over simplistic. In the first you had to choose a sword for each monster in the second it was just silver for monsters, iron for humans.

They had a 20 year marriage and there was 12 years between when she went to Harvard and when they divorced. She worked as a lawyer at her own firm and her paycheck went towards the family income. 

Her child from the previous marriage was in college when they divorced and the younger one was 17 and wanted to stay with her dad because she wanted to stay in the house she grew up in. She also paid $1200/month in child support. 

[She also took her children to Massachusetts](http://www.star-telegram.com/2014/01/20/5499243/davis-dramatic-story-may-have.html?rh=1) the first year she was in Harvard. They then went back and stayed with their dad in Texas after that. She didn't leave them as has been suggested. 

She also didn't lie about anything. Her marriage with Jeff has been reported on widely and she's done multiple interviews about her past with him including an in depth article by the [Texas Tribune 5 months ago.](http://www.texastribune.org/2011/06/05/filibuster-propels-wendy-davis-into-spotlight/)

This scandal is being manufactured. What is the most telling is that what a reporter from the DMN has to say about Jeff Davis appears to be more important than what Jeff Davis has to say for himself considering CNN is the only source that has run his recent comments. 

If you want further proof here is the DMN conveniently leaving out the [decade between when Davis graduated Harvard and the divorce](http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/2014/01/disappointment-about-the-true-wendy-davis-story.html/), or the one where CNN acts as if the divorce took place right after the last payment in [2003 when the divorce was in 2005](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/01/20/report-wendy-davis-life-story-more-complicated-than-compelling-narrative/)

&gt;  Does that answer your question?

Well, sort of. So. To recap:

If someone wants to hijack your body, and you've had sex (willingly or unwillingly, so far), you have to let them.

Unless a doctor says you will *definitely* die, then they can be removed. Not the hijacker who might die, just you. (Which is sort of awkward for the hijacker, huh? If they're at risk, tough cookies. Just hang on until they die nine months later?)

In a situation where you *will die*, a doctor, not you, must determine the risk to your life and *only then* can you decide whether you're willing to host a hijacker.

Are there any other times you would like to take my bodily decisions out of my hands except in a circumstance where I am definitely going to die?

If I have a tumor or a vestigial twin, does it need to be life threatening to operate? If someone grafts themselves to my lymph system without my permission, does my life have to be at risk to remove them from my body?

How does this jibe with my 'natural rights' again? Do only hijackers get those? Am I not entitled to them once someone else exists?"

&gt;Our investor is strong and capable of funding the complete development of our project. But he does not follow the game industry very closely, and needs proof that publishers and marketers are wrong about our game - that you are indeed interested in a mature, medieval RPG that emphasizes freedom and authenticity. And so we stand, as a studio, at a crossroads. Either those naysayers are right, and there truly is no desire for the game we are making, or we are right.

Billy over Josh somewhat makes sense depending on the league type. Billy could single handedly win you the steals category if he hits leadoff and has an OBP above .315. Hamilton really is only going to contribute in power and rbis which can be replaced with other players who may be able to help in other areas.

Mauer in the second makes no sense. People can be idiots in mock drafts.

If by Hanley being the clear #1 just short stop then I can see that. In just over 300 ABs Hanley hit 20 HRs, knocked in 57 runs, stole ten bases and hit .345. Granted those numbers aren't sustainable for a whole season but if he played a whole year he could have in theory hit 40 HRs, knocked in 100 Runs and stole 20 bases. That would by far be the top shortstop in the game hell with numbers like that at SS he would be worth consideration as the first overall pick.

Verlander over Scherzer is tough. Scherzer had a really great season last year but regression is coming. No way will his win numbers be that high this year and he probably will not be as good. I personally wouldn't take him over Scherzer not because I like him less but because I know I'm reaching and could get him a round or two later most likely. Verlander had a bit of a down year but he is still one of the best in the game if he is on track, as he showed in the playoffs. "

I dance salsa and there's this guy who does this awkward lift with every girl who is new and unaware enough to dance with him- he stops your whole momentum and lifts you straight up into the air in front of him, making the most uncomfortable eye contact imaginable. It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't slide the girl's body down his front as he brought her back down, not to mention that he wasn't gentle about any of it either. I walked off the floor in the middle of a song when he dropped me on my ankle. 

Anyway, It became a running joke among the local salseros that he looked like Rafiki lifting Simba, to the point that the name stuck. One night... one fine night, he did it again, but the DJ was waiting for it. He stopped the music and turned on the Circle of Life, and everyone stopped what they were doing to turn and look at this guy (and the poor unwitting girl dancing with him). We haven't seen much of him since.

If the ball hits a can and goes off of the table, Team B members have to run after the ball and touch it to the table and yell stop. At this point, Team B gets to go on the offense. The first team to finish their beers is the victorious team. Everyone wins because you have to chug your beer so you get drunk even if your team loses. Plus, running around drunk is loads of fun.

What's a trans woman? That is enough information. I am not a cis woman, which is I'm sure what you mean by ""technically a woman.""

You don't seem to get the concept of sex and gender being different. They are not the same thing. The fact that my karyotype is likely XY (I haven't had it tested, and I'd be surprised if you know yours either.) doesn't have any bearing on my gender. 

Also, the concept of biological sex isn't as cut and dried as you are making it seem. If we only considered chromosomes, then I'd be considered male, but so would[ this woman](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9262272), who is XY but can get pregant. If we only consider hormones, then my hormone levels are within female range. If we only considered secondary sex characteristics, then I'd be considered female. If genitals are the only thing that matters, then right now I'd considered male until I get bottom surgery. Fertility? Plenty of other people are sterile, so that doesn't affect me. Gonads? That's another thing. Right now, male, but what would that mean for someone with testicular cancer or someone who had to get their ovaries removed childhood? All of those things are varying definitions of ""biological sex,"" and most can be changed in a person.

Most of those things are things you can't know about a person. You can't ask a stranger for a blood test to see what their hormone levels and karoytype are. You'd get in some kind of trouble if you started asking your 
co-workers to drop their pants before you decided on pronouns. Asking for proof of fertility would also be very rude.

So how are you deciding what gendered pronouns (he, she, etc.) to use? You going to go by things like secondary sex characteristics, gender presentation (clothes, makeup, etc.), what their name is and what pronouns other people use.

This means that gender is far more important than sex in daily life. Does my doctor need to know that I have a prostate and that my hormones are in female range? Yes. Does my dentist? Definitely not. Do my co-workers know if I've had surgery or not? No, why is that their business?

&gt; I do recommend that a person with any kind of dysphoria seek consultation.

Since you're familiar with the DSM-5, what's the treatment for gender dysphoria?"

[You beef more with the guy across the street than the guy across the globe](http://i.imgur.com/XYpmJpU.png), but being exploited by the west hasn't helped. It's hard to maintain a proper government when the world powers prefer you in turmoil so it's easier to exploit your resources.

For all the talk about raping babies being stupid. It's not like Africa learned to trust western knowledge. Look at what happened with [Nestle and breast milk](http://i.imgur.com/jlQW0iy.png). Using western knowledge is responsible for the death of millions of infants who would have lived had they been breast fed.

It's not like the West has been traditionally all that gung ho about helping out Africa or apologizing for the largest forced migration of any peoples in recorded history.

Yeah now that all the other countries have utilized decades of labor to leapfrog their technology everything in Africa is still the fault of a few Kenyans who started slave trade by trading their butlers\* into slavery, and then got railroaded when the foreigners realized what they had stumbled upon.

The US runs on a cycle of debt. You get debt, so you bust your ass trying to pay it off. You work jobs you hate, for bosses you hate, because they pay just enough for you to pay your debts. You don't get ahead, you just get by. And since you can't get ahead, you end up taking on more debt to have things you want.

We can then make the assumption that if you cut the caloric intake by a quarter, you should also cut the nutritional recs by the same amount. So 2000 calories becomes 1500, and 10mg* becomes 7.5mg.* In theory, your nutrients and calories are proportionally equally distributed throughout your pitcher of Soylent, so all you have to do is drink 1500 calories' worth and you'll automatically get 7.5mg* of potassium.

It's not a country and it has nothing to do with dictators or government leaders. All people involved are fully formed people, which bypasses the fact that fetuses are not legally considered people.

Your argument also doesn't make sense. If you can't communicate, there are many ways to allow that person to communicate. I said nothing about disabilities. If you read what I wrote, I talked about a woman (who is a complete person) and a fetus (who is not). The fetus doesn't have the same rights and privileges as a whole person, therefore the woman's rights take precedence. Being not fully formed isn't a disability and a fetus isn't trying to communicate. It's simply not a person yet.

But absolutely everyone I talked to, old friends, new friends, coworkers, would make fun of me and call me a cougar.  Or they'd make a face when they learn I was with a younger guy.  Either a wince or a look of pity.  We dated for 3 years and not once did someone use the word ""cougar"" in a positive, encouraging way.

I don't think so. What I would like is for drag performers and people who like to watch RuPaul's Drag Race to be made more aware of the very big difference between drag performers and trans people who want to transition. Many people don't understand that ""tranny"" is a very bad slur for trans people, for example. Once I saw a gay male facebook friend comment on another gay friend's wall, calling him a tranny. I commented and then had a message exchange with him. He wouldn't believe me that it was an offensive word, and ended with, ""it's okay man, we're all trannies."" So he didn't see me as a woman, he saw me as a man who likes to be called ""she,"" and who should be humoured."

Another example was the ridiculous comments a family made after a teen was stabbed to death when he was playing ""Knockout Game"". They were furious the guy that legally defended himself was not being charged because it was determined to be self defense. They publicly called their son ""a good kid"" while trying to make the victim into a monster. His mother said ""nobody has the right to take someone's life."" Considering several people have died from this ""game"" I guess the irony was completely lost on them.

cassidymccormick,AdviceAnimals,1390534909.0,"I had a similar situation once. A bunch of guys sat down next to me on the bus and they seemed sort of intimidating because of the way they acted and spoke, but I didn't want to move because they were literally in the middle of a conversation about white girls treating black guys like criminals. I was about fourteen at the time, and I thought to myself, ""Well, I'm not going to just randomly move now, that will only prove their point, even if they are being rude, drunk, and belligerent.""

Bus ride goes by, they say some rude things to my friends and I, which we just ignore because, being young and already nervous, we feel like we're already trapped. Finally, one of the guys leans over, rips my headband off my head and throws it out the window. I turn around and notice that their all staring at me a little too creepily now and laughing, so I grab my friends and we get off at the next stop. They get off in front of me and just as I'm about to go, one of the guys grabs my arm to hold me there and proceeds to spit on me while one of the others guys slaps my ass, and then pushes me away, calling ""Dumb white bitch,"" as I hurry off the bus. 

It was a matter of ass holes being ass holes, no matter what the race. I should have just stuck with my gut instinct and moved right away.

TL;DR: Got spat on, slapped, and called a dumb white bitch just for being in someone's general proximity. Stick with your gut on whether you're in an unsafe situation and act, no matter what implications might come from it. "

She had everything in the world anyone could want; a loving husband, two beautiful children and her husband had just landed his dream job.  They were driving their two cars across the mountains during a snowstorm.  Her husband was in front driving one of the cars pulling a trailer with her kids sleeping in the backseat.  She was behind driving her car.  She watched in horror as an oncoming truck collided with her family's car, sending it off a cliff.  Everyone involved died.  She was slightly injured and taken to a hospital, or she said she would have jumped off the cliff after them.  After she was discharged, she was on the verge of suicide, but was a devout Catholic and wasn't willing to give up being reunited with them in heaven.  Instead, she volunteered to be a missionary somewhere in Africa that was very dangerous.  She was certain that she would be killed.  Of course, she wasn't, and slowly but surely her grief subsided.  After a few years, she learned to love again and married one of the African doctors.  At the end of the interview, she summed it up saying that if her life wasn't useful to her, it could be useful to someone else.  Through being useful, she learned to be a new person.  One who could love and laugh again.  During my darkest days, I'd think of her story.  It made me realize that there is always hope for happiness, as long as you are alive."

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1390535086.0,"A couple months after we started dating, we went to a craft show together in our home town. At this show, I saw a large framed photograph (of two pears leaning against each other in a romantic fashion) I absolutely adored and really wanted to buy. But it cost close to a $1000, so I passed. But it was so difficult to tear myself away from it. I am not an artsy person at all, and have never bought a painting or print or other piece or art before.

I loved the concept of the romantic pears though, and we ended up getting really into pears after that as a couple. Like pear salad became our favourite salad, which we would always order and split between us. And he started calling me his 'little pear' or we refereed to ourselves as a 'pair of pears'. And we would talk about having a green and silver pear theme at our future wedding. (I know, I know, this is getting gag worthy, so sorry).

Well, six months later we left our hometown so I could start school (he moved with me), and shortly after the move it was my birthday. He had to leave for a business trip so he wasn't there on my birthday. But he called me and told me to check behind the dresser, where I found a card and a small gift. The card was actually the start of a scavenger hunt, where at each station I found another card and small gift....until eventually it led me to the place where the final prize was hidden....it was the photograph I had fallen in love with 8 months ago!

He had spent the whole summer trying to track down the vendor (didn't know the guy's name, so had to email the organizers of the craft show), and then made a surreptitious visit to our home town to buy the photograph. And then he hid the framed photo (which was huge) and all the scavenger items around our apartment before he left on his trip. That was actually way more touching to me than the money he spent on the photograph (which was a lot).

The photo occupies the main wall in our living room now, and always will! And I am still his 'little pear'. &lt;3"

Dan savage recommends you even come clean but in the context of: I'll pretend not to look at porn if you'll pretend to believe me. Sit her down and you two agree never to mention/leave evidence of your porn use so long as she agrees not to ask about it or snoop for said evidence. 
To add some professional relationship columnist cred to your pitch, you can show her his [column about porn](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=15715) or [this interview](http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2013/Fight-Club/) where he lays it out succinctly:

&gt;Is there something you wish people would stop writing to you about? 

&gt;Porn. All men look at porn, and most women do, too. If you have a problem with porn or your partner looking at porn, the only solution is for your partner to pretend not to look at it and for you to pretend to believe him or her.

Still though if you're young and the relationship is young just kick the can down the road and lie for 6 more months (very carefully) then tell her you want to ""start again"" and do the Dan Savage deal. There's two types of guys, guys who watch porn and dirty goddamn liars, sooner or later she'll learn this, whether you decide to cut your losses in order to kick off the lesson or not.

steve496,49ers,1390535485.0,"Lets unpack the Ted Ginn example a bit, because I think its actually a bit more subtle than it might seem.  There's no doubt that he was a lot more productive with the Panthers this year... but then, they also played him a lot more.  He was their #3 WR, something that he never was with the 49ers - largely, I think, because they were more tolerant of his tendency to drop passes than Harbaugh seems to be.

If, for instance, we compare is 2011 campaign with the 49ers to this year with the Panthers: in 2011, he got 27 touches (19 receptions, 8 runs) with the 49ers on 351 offensive snaps, or 1 touch every 13 snaps on offense.  With the Panthers, he got 40 touches (36 receptions, 4 rushes) on 502 snaps, or 1 touch every 12.5 snaps - very nearly the same.  Admittedly, his yards per touch is up a fair amount (14.6 vs 10.6)... but then, in 2011, he was playing with Alex Smith, who's preference for checking down is well-established.

So, are the Panthers using him better, or just using him more?  Hard to say - probably some of each, honestly.  But its not as simple as comparing his 556 receiving yards this year to his 1 receiving yard last year.

As for the Patriots: yes, they did much better with a patchwork of receivers than we did.  But then, I don't think anyone is going to argue that Kap is in Brady's league.  There's probably some difference in scheme as well, but I think a lot of it is that Kap isn't nearly as efficient at going through his reads.  If you have 5 receivers out in the pattern, Kap will check 2 or 3 of them and then run; Brady will get through all 5, and probably some of them more than once, and find the one that's managed to work his way open.  And that's necessarily going to result in more production for mediocre receivers.  Its also why he's a Hall of Famer, and Kap isn't.  At least not yet."

But the physical harm resulting from car accidents very well may involve other people.

That is, lets say I am driving somewhere and make some mistake that results in a car crash with another vehicle. If someone in that other vehicle dies, I am the cause of their death.

Now, I don't know that it makes sense for people to be by law required to protect themselves from the harm caused by others for the sake of their guilty conscious.

If Gilbert or Dennard was available at 20, I'm sure the 49ers would seriously consider trading up; but I think they'd rather give, say, 30, 77, and our 5th rounder (~165th, depending on compensatory picks) for pick 20 than try to work out a combo deal involving the 2nd rounder as well."

My story:

When I was about 12 years old, my family went to visit an acquaintance. In the backyard, my sisters and I (middle sister: 11 y/o, youngest sister: 6 y/o) found a very old fashioned, self-propelled merry-go-round contraption. It was made of solid iron, so it was very heavy. The way it worked was, there were 4 seats on it, at the end of a + shape. One of the seats had a lever, which were to be turned to make the merry-go-round well, go :) (if you imagine a pushing and pulling motion in a circle while seated, that's how it went.)

Anyway, my youngest sister asked me to sit in it with her, and I was to be controlling it. I turned the lever, and the contraption went backwards. We liked this, so I sped up.

Then I decided to stop it, and attempted to bring this massive iron thing to a halt by trying to stop the lever from rotating. Naturally, my 12 year old wrists and arm was not enough for the ~600 lbs carousel to stop, and my right wrist broke.

I got off and ran screaming to my dad, that I broke my wrist! He could see it was swelling up something nasty, so he started to bandage it with cold water wetted strips of cloth.

He was barely halfway through this process (5 minutes after I ran to him), when my middle sister suddenly comes around from the backyard, screaming ""Daaaaad! I broke my wrist!""

My poor dad could see her right wrist swelling up, exactly like mine.
""How did it happen?!"" He asked incredulously, while still consoling me and wrapping my wrist.

""Well"" she bawled ""I was going backwards on the merry-go-round, and I tried to stop it by the handle.....""

My dad couldn't help it but laugh in desperation. We managed to break our wrists the same way, on the same thing, the same right side wrist, and even the same place on the bone, only 5 minutes apart.

This then became a fun story to tell the doctors we went to have the casts put on us :)

Bonus bit: It was only a few months ago I was reminiscing with my youngest sister about this, and she confessed to me that she still feels bad and like it was her fault we broke our wrists, because it was her who asked for us to turn the handles backwards, and then it was her both times who yelled that she wanted to get off right now. :)"

Once he gets DFG, he can 1v1 pretty much anyone, and come out ahead, and if he gets his ult off on the adc, he can singlehandedly win the fight.  However, with the current meta, he doesn't fit as well.  While it was worse last season, he still doesn't fit in most games.

Imo he kind of holds the same niche as Poppy:  he may not have the strongest laning phase (he is easily ganked, Poppy is not that good at laning), but once you get a few items built, you can just go manmode and wreck stuff.  However, getting to the point where you can go full-on manmode can be difficult, and Poppy and Morde don't fit that well into the current meta."

This seems like a rebranding of the current policy that tries to paint Perry as being more progressive than he is while taking the wind out of the legalization movement by trying to pacify people with half measures that aren't any real form of progress. If Perry were ever to make it into the white house I would fully expect a reversal of the Obama policy on criminal enforcement of possession at the federal level.

One piece of advice is to consider the skill set of the players you are refereeing. If you are holding the whistle in a Z-Division, 4th grade game, no-one is going to be able to roll away very quickly, or come to there feet fast so things will get a little sloppy at break down time. Unless there is a deliberate or obvious infringement, you might be better off leaving the whistle out of your mouth for a bit.

Another Tip for young refs. Scrum time. Those boys have been sticking their beaten up noggins into scrums for longer than you have been alive. DO NOT try to tell them how to scrummage. Make you calls, get it set and get out of their way."

slyg,FutureWhatIf,1390536386.0,"Yeah, i figured i probably got his name wrong. But it didn't counter my argument. It comes down to technologically advanced and intelligence. Just because they are more technologically advanced does not mean they are smarter.  However, you could argue that technologically advancement takes time and generations. this is research to suggest that newer generations are more intelligent then previous generations. So based on that you could argue that if the have advanced technology the are more intelligent because their civilization is a lot older then ours.  This argument is based on the average IQ.  This argument still does not directly contradict my statements but is a strong argument.  

My arguments was generally more focused on an individual IQ. First, the aliens flying the ship might be the equivalent of a ""soccer mum"" or air head. Someone or a group that have no clue how to build a car or a spaceship. What they do know, is simply how to drive it. 

Second argument, which you more or less addressed. By stating that aliens arrived soon.  But this does not directly address this point. My point is that the guys who invent the plan or the car are likely smart enough to invent the jet engine. The difference would be the availability of technology and access to information.  A good counter to this point could be with advance technology you tend to get advancements in education. But is advanced education the same as advance intelligence? I'm not sure but probably, i have yet to look for/see any or  research on this. The primary problem with this would be defining intelligence which is still controversial.  

I do agree with

&gt; Now it isn't a question of whether they will be smarter than us or not, but how much smarter.

seekunrustlement,assassinscreed,1390536638.0,"sorry :P i was being a bit facetious because I can get sensitive about mental health awareness. Looking at their symptoms (which we don't see a lot of), they seem distressed. So that could be anxiety, but anxiety can be caused by any number of things, and may be a disorder by itself, or may be a result of something else. Come to think of it, sure they could be a Developmentally Challenged individual, but if so, they're still not in a calm state of mind, so that's not their *normal* behavior.


I was thinking a psychosis or Schizophrenia because they seem so out of tune with the crowd around them. By definition, psychosis refers to a break from reality. That causes distress, and thus anxiety. It would also explain the mumbling from them we hear in the game, and how they seem to react violently to Altair as he passes near them. And again, Developmentally Challenged person *could* act that way, but you couldn't tell it was that condition just from that behavior. And Down Syndrome to be specific, also alters the facial structure and other physical features in obvious ways.


edit: as for Tourette's. I mentioned that because their jerky movements and strange utterances could be ticks. Anxiety Disorders can cause ticks too."

TimDaEnchanter,leagueoflegends,1390536691.0,"To be fair, if you know a specific champion extremely well, you would usually have a pretty good winrate with them.  For instance, if you knew Mundo or Vi as well as you do Skarner and had as much experience playing with them, you would be able to achieve an 80% winrate with them.

Back in season 3, a lot of people considered Ashe and Sivir to be pretty bad picks (before Sivir rework).  My friend who mained adc had about a 90% winrate with both of them in plat 4.

Americans only see conservatives as being the group of small government because historically the US has had a relatively small government. If the US had a history of being a communist state, ""Conservatives"" would be the group in favor of staying communist, rather than trying other forms of government. There's nothing inherent about Conservatism that suggests small government. 

Conversely, libertarianism *is* defined by the size and scope of the government.

Secondly, this is gonna sound like horse shit but start exercising, ya ya ya you're underweight but exercise is the body's BEST way to relieve stress. Start small though like a banana 30 minutes before and run a lap or 2 around your neighborhood. Immediately after have some chicken or a protein shake and take a nice warm shower and just relax.

It gives men benefits as they are more likely to get good paying jobs but also that they are also more likely to be stereotyped as criminals. Men are the norm in the crime according to the patriarchy, especially people of color. "

Vi+Leblanc can kill you before you have the chance to do anything.  Vi+Malphite can kill you pretty easily if they ult 1 after the other, and you'll probably die without the ability to do anything.  A lot of the time, if you focus Yasuo, you can take him down pretty quickly, but getting to him to focus him is the challenge.  Also, at least from my experience, Yasuo doesn't tend to use his shield much before his initiation with his ult, so the refresh on his shield really doesn't affect that much since he would usually have about full shield anyway.  I don't think that he generally gets that much lifesteal (at least, he wouldn't get any in his first two big items, probably not his third either), but when you get to lategame when everyone has 5 or 6 items, there are a lot of other champs that are hard to peel.  A full build Olaf is practically impossible to peel: he has loads of health, and can't be CCed.

TL;DR:  There are a lot of two champion combos that can pretty much 100-0 an adc without much of a possibility of counterplay by the adc.  That does not mean that one of the champions is OP or not."

The robins/batgirls are likely to be one of his first targets to kill because they know him the best.  One problem with them being the his solution is that they would be fighting batman like batman.  I don't think it's possible to beat him that way, has anyone tried?

jubbergun,AdviceAnimals,1390537451.0,"&gt; in the late 1700s, news was seen as vital to liberty and democracy, but no one then foresaw that such an important societal function would become a business in the hands of the nation's richest.

[You might want to at least hit wikipedia before you make such a generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias_in_the_United_States\)):

**Before the rise of professional journalism in the early 1900s, and the conception of media ethics, newspapers reflected the opinions of the publisher. Frequently, an area would be served by competing newspapers taking differing and often radical views by modern standards.**

*In 1728 Benjamin Franklin, writing under the pseudonym ""Busy-Body"", wrote an article for the American Weekly Mercury advocating the printing of more paper money. He did not mention that his own printing company hoped to get the job of printing the money. It is an indication of the complexity of the issue of bias when it is noted that, even though he stood to profit by printing the money, Franklin also seems to have genuinely believed that printing more money would stimulate trade. As his biographer Walter Isaacson points out, Franklin was never averse to ""doing well by doing good"".*
 
*In 1798, the Congress of the United States passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited the publication of ""false, scandalous, or malicious writing"" against the government, and made it a crime to voice any public opposition to any law or presidential act. This act was in effect until 1801.*

[News as a public trust stopped being a concept over forty years ago with the launch of *60 Minutes*.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/19/AR2009081901811.html) 

*With the debut of ""60 Minutes"" in 1968, Mr. Hewitt merged elements of news and entertainment and shattered the traditional view that news divisions were run as a public trust with little concern for how much money they made.*

xSolcii,TwoXChromosomes,1390537453.0,"I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I hope you're doing well now. My younger SIL is going through something just like what you went through(she'd probably be sent to 'fat camp' if it existed where we live). Her parents always shame her for being overweight/obese but they never take her to any doctors or try to help her with her diets or exercise. They give her a lot of fatty foods and chew her out if she doesn't diet - but she's only 12 and doesn't buy or cook her own food yet.

As for me... I was body-shamed by my dad's side of the family, but because I was too small. I was 5'0"" and 92lbs. I was petite and liked how I looked... but every time I went to my paternal grandparents' home, they told me I was too skinny and to eat more. They always said I never ate enough(even though I would eat two or three plates per meal, and eat a lot throughout the day). They always made up these crazy stories, about how my mom never fed me, how I probably was so thin because I never ate, how I was probably anorexic or bulimic. It was horrible and very hurtful.

I hate any kind of body shaming. I'm set on never being like my grandparents, or my in-laws, or your mom. Fat shaming or skinny shaming or whatever-shape-you-are shaming is horrible, plain and simple, and creates lots of issues with the way we perceive our bodies."

injoy,Christianity,1390537489.0,"Ah, that all was very gracious. :)  I was hoping to write back longer, but I am a mommy of five little ones and tonight was a busy night!  So I will just say... I understand why you hope for universalism.  Wrath is way out of the current way of thinking.  I was raised Arminian and I know the (smaller) struggle to go from thinking everybody at least has a choice, to the point of view that God decides by His will alone.  Eventually after ages of wrestling with it internally, I realized that my ideas of ""fair"" were definitely not in compliance with the most obvious biblical interpretations, and that I was twisting around Scripture to try to make it fit my idea of ""fair.""  And... it's a hard thing to accept that my internal compass might be wrong.  But eventually Scripture convinced me, and then as I have learned more, honestly my compass has changed.  I understand better how it is ""fair"" for God to be the potter, and it's not so repulsive that he does what he wants with the pots.  This is over-simplifying greatly, and I'm not trying to present an argument to you for non-universalism, much less Calvinism. :)  BUT, I would encourage you... consider if you are reading Scripture in a way to match your heart, or if you are trying to match your heart to what Scripture overall, in context, in *sum*, seems to be saying.  Read the Old Testament, like Genesis to Deuteronomy, and see God's idea of justice.  See His wrath in action and see if it is fair.

Ezekiel 5:13 says He is ""satisfied"" by ""venting his fury"".  Proverbs 1:26 says He *laughs* at the calamity that strikes the wicked.  Revelation 18:20 calls the church to ""rejoice"" in God's judgement.  Deuteronomy 28:63 says ""the Lord will _take delight_ in bringing ruin upon you and destroying you.""  God delights in **bringing** ruin?  God **laughs** at the calamity of the wicked? God finds it **satisfying** to vent His fury?

This is what I couldn't get around--if our hearts are erroneous in their leading us toward universalism, then we are *wrong* to wish He is something other than what He is.  We are wrong to hope for mercy where He has promised justice.  We should rejoice in who He really is, and not wish that He was somehow different."

bayesienne,AskReddit,1390537536.0,"I went to a very upper-middle-class private girls high school that was big on extra-curricular activities, so I really got into drama.

However, when casting was announced in front of everyone, I was told that I was going to be the chambermaidâa role they had 'created especially for me' because even though 'there were no Asians around in 1900s Australia' I was 'too good to not include in the cast'.

I had a lot of scenes, more than most of the others, and some shared with the only other Asian who had been cast as my gardener boyfriend. But instead of being happy, I just remember being really confused and upset. This wasn't some professional play. It was an amateur school production held in our drama space. It clearly wasn't a question of my acting abilities, either. They literally couldn't bring themselves to cast me as a student or a teacher in a 1900s boarding school because putting an Asian in that scenario was too outrageous.

I think this was particularly memorable because I learned, for the first time as a 16 year old, that even in a supposed safe space you will always be judged for your race before your merit."

My boyfriend moved in with me and tried my body wash and he loves it.  It doesn't smell and he doesn't get dry skin (which was exasperated by both the hard water in the shower and the dry winter). 

You want the [colloidal oatmeal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenanthramide) because of the Avenanthramides that's in it.  It helps with itchy skin.  I don't see anything on there about scars, however.  

I have heard that petroleum jelly actually helps with moisturizing scars though.  It's recommended because the more expensive stuff (with shea butter and vitamin E added) usually doesn't work.  It should help with itch and probably won't burn."

mandym347,Pathfinder_RPG,1390537788.0,"Last year, when we tore my husband's run of Rise of the Runelords to shreds (went way off module), we had a sorcerer in the party go that route.  We had a big party near-wipe, and the group was scattered, and we had a second string group of new characters come in as a search and rescue team.

We put the old party back together and reassumed control of our original characters, but when we did, we kept noticing funny things about our friend the sorcerer.  He stopped eating with us, kept making weird jokes about eating our brains, letting loose new skills/powers/immunities/knowledge that he did not have before, etc.  He assured us with very plausible reasons, and we were wary, but we kept on.

Meanwhile, he and my husband the DM were working out a plan.  In the end, he left the party right before the last dungeon and came in with a new character.  We were surprised, but hey, switching characters isn't all that remarkable.  When our good sorcerer friend was revealed at the end as the end boss who set up the final encounters, we were genuinely shocked.  The guy had played his own character as he worked to thwart us (offering bad advice, switching items when we weren't looking, alerting enemies to our presence, etc.), but as soon as he became the end boss, his character sheet went to the DM, and he switched to the new character.  All of us, including him, then had to fight his newly-made lich.

(""Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"" we all cried in harmony.)

It was fantastic at the end because his character knew ours - strengths, weaknesses, relationships, etc, so he was able to rig traps and encounters to hit us at our most vulnerable spots.  He was unplanned, unexpected, and emotionally-connected to us.  His ""betrayal"" hurt far worse than any NPC boss could ever have, and even destroying his phylactery hurt is because we were laying an old friend to rest despite what he had become.  It was great."

frackaracka,worldnews,1390537796.0,"No, that's not the case. India is actually very open to other people. Its history of invasion by different cultures from the Mughals to the British Empire has made it a big melting pot swirling with different cultures, languages, and people.

What's going on here is a perfect storm of factors. Indian culture is very repressed sexually; people are expected to be virgins at marriage, and romantic relations with the opposite sex are highly discouraged before that. Then on top of that, you have a cultural mindset that privileges the male sex over the female. Daughters are considered to be an expense in the form of dowry, i.e. ""watering your neighbor's lawn"", whereas boys are more valuable because they will provide for the family.

What's been happening is that as women become more and more educated, they have been progressing faster than the men. And when men come from the rural villages - where women are covered up and treated like property - to seek opportunities in the cities, they are shocked to find modern, urban, educated girls walking around. They get angry. This is not how things are supposed to be. These sexy sex objects should be put back in their place.

Combine that entitled mentality with the fact that police and government do a poor job of preventing and prosecuting crimes - especially sex crimes, which are too taboo to mention - along with a bunch of male friends who come from similar circumstances, and you have the recipe for getting away with murder.

SnatchThief,AMA,1390537805.0,"AHHHH, what you've described above. Let me break it down for you.

* SHE'S THAI. You made her lose face in front of your friend. That is a HUGE no-no.

* SHE'S THAI. You shouldn't tell her she's wrong about anything. Do you know about greng jai? Also, see the losing face thing above. I know very few traditional Thais who can admit when they are wrong. It's embarrassing. And a traditional Thai wouldn't tell someone that they are wrong (even if they are).

* SHE'S THAI. Most traditional Thai women I know stick to their men LIKE GLUE because they are so afraid they will cheat. Are the women paranoid? Not really - men do cheat here, and they do it often. Other women don't care that a man has a girlfriend and/or wife already. They. Do. Not. Care. It's insane. How do I know this? I've been living in Thailand more than four years. I've lived in both Chiang Mai and Bangkok. I will say that BKK has much more modern and western-style relationships. But the insane crazy jealousy is still an issue here.

* Not sure about this one, it could be a sign of being nuts. Or it could be a sign of trying to control you. I've never dated a Thai woman, being a woman myself, but I've heard EVERYONE (including Thai women themselves!) say ""all Thai women are crazy."" So there's that.

* Uhhh... if I heard my parents say things like that, I'd have abandonment issues too. Don't think you can count that as evidence of Borderline.

Anyway. My diagnosis: she's a Thai female. One of the more crazy ones, perhaps, but still. Thai female."

This basically means you will be killing more enemies on counterattacks than on your turn. Because they can't attack at adjacent range, Archers usually won't counterattack on the enemy turn, and thus won't gain as much experience as other units. They're fine for levels with lots of enemy archers though. "

I also think it should be easier to kick attackers out of the base. At the moment it can feel like whack a mole when trying to flip the points and deny the attackers a spawn option.

If you set the radio down while it is on, anything said on that frequency is broadcast ""from"" the radio in directional chat. So it's more like a stationary radio. So if you have a walkie and your companions don't, but you want them to hear what other people are saying on the net, you can just set the walkie on the ground and they can hear it locally.

You cannot hear things FROM it. A person has to depress the key on the walkie (CAPS LOCK) to actually activate it to transmit. Otherwise, it is listen-only.

Also of note, if the walkie is on you, you are the only one that hears it. It does not broadcast from you, only TO you. Whereas when it is on the ground, it broadcasts TO the radio FROM the radio.

EDIT: I was hasty and incorrect. I did some more thorough testing with someone without a radio as well. Results here.

But the drive fades the next day when you wake up and you're back to normal. I do feel like shrooms have always been an awesome experience, and I feel a very serene afterglow for about a week. But shrooms won't really make you actively change your life. What it's really good for is coming to a sort of acceptance of your current situation. The moments when I've sat there and thought through my problems, they've become easier for me to handle even months down the road."

itsnotgoingtohappen,PolishGauntlet,1390538367.0,"Yayyy, happy belated birthday and welcome! I'd start looking at your diet if your nails are in that kind of condition. Are you getting the right kinds of fats? Enough protein? Enough iron &amp; calcium? Leafy greens, coconut oil, and legumes are going to be your new BFFs. Also, I started supplementing with biotin and I love it! Prenatal vitamins are also good for hair &amp; nails.

Also, how do you cut down &amp; shape your nails? Always make sure to clip while nails are soft (after being soaked in water for a bit), and file in one direction.

What shape and length are your nails? Some shapes are inherently weaker, and if your nails are already on the weak side, length might work against you.

You may want to consider taking a few days a month off from polish with an unpolished manicure (or just polish with a strengthener or intensive repair formula like Nailtiques 2 Plus or Nail Tek II). 

Finally, go easy on drying products like acetone based nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol if you use that for oil removal.

I hope this helps! Welcome again - I'm looking forward to happy updates ;)"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390538412.0,"If it helps, in my opinion anyway, the first ""date"" isn't really a date when it comes to online dating.  You need to meet first, so think of this as two interested parties that met up to see for one, that no one was crazy, and two, if there's any potential.

There's really no need for touching, hugging, kissing, etc.  Honestly, it's not a big deal.  I've had a couple LTRs from online dating (currently in one now), and neither had touching on the first meeting.  It's really not a big deal.

Just a future reference for next time, I always recommend saying something after the date - give her a hug, say you had a great time, and something like ""we should do this again sometime.""  But since you didn't (still not a big deal), just send her a text saying you had a good time and  that you'd like to meet up again - if you want, you can even work on setting something else up.

Their economy would be based on fishing and whaling, and they make a constitution that promises they'll never commit another criminal act so long as each of them live. Problem is, there are psychos in this group, so there's a civil war that splits the nation in two. The pyschos are eventually defeated. The leader of the non-psychos is a drug dealer who went to prison for smuggling two tankers full of weed. Anyway, eventually their resources are depleted and most of them die from excessive exposure to the cold. Some of them, including Weed-guy, become refugees after hijacking passing ships, and they sail off to conquer North Korea. North Korea is liberated from its dictatorship and the ex-American prisoners claim North Korea as New Antarctica. The legacy continues.

mfranko88,WinMyArgument,1390538448.0,"Check out your state statutes or laws and find the matching section about licenses. Here is the [relevant](http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C300-399/3020000020.HTM) section from Missouri's statutes.

&gt;302.020. 1. Unless otherwise provided for by law, it shall be unlawful for any person, except those expressly exempted by section 302.080, to:

&gt;(1) Operate any vehicle upon any highway in this state unless the person has a valid license;

&gt;....

Earlier in the RSMO, it legally [defines](http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/C300-399/3020000010.HTM) a few key phrases:

&gt;(2) ""Commercial motor vehicle"", a motor vehicle designed or regularly used for carrying freight and merchandise, or more than fifteen passengers;

&gt;(7) ""Highway"", any public thoroughfare for vehicles, including state roads, county roads and public streets, avenues, boulevards, parkways, or alleys in any municipality;

&gt;(9) ""License"", a license issued by a state to a person which authorizes a person to operate a motor vehicle;

&gt;(10) ""Motor vehicle"", any self-propelled vehicle not operated exclusively upon tracks except motorized bicycles, as defined in section 307.180;


So there are a few things here:

1. A motor vehicle is distinct from a commercial motor vehicle. In the definition of the latter, it says it is a specific subset of the former. So, all commercial motor vehicles are motor vehicles, but not all motor vehicles are commercial motor vehicles.

2. A license is required to operate any motor vehicle on any ""highway""

3. A ""highway"" is any public street.

This is only one state. I'm somewhat familiar with the RSMO because of a high school mock-government activity. I couldn't help you with other states specifically, but just do a little bit of digging and you'll find comparable information.

There is absolutely no federal regulation on driver's licenses, so all applicable laws would be state laws. The closest thing is [2005's Real-ID Act.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REAL_ID_Act), which saw 24 states pass resolutions opposing the Act. In other words, the states don't care.

The closest thing we have to accepted federal regulations on licenses are the [Commercial Driver's License Requirements](http://www.dmv.org/insurance/cdl-federal-requirements.php). There's nothing there that helps me conclude how this person ever arrived at this conclusion.

It looks like your quoted argument was copy/pasted from somewhere. Can you source it?"

* Crying is physiological healing, so one or two good crying sessions is OK. Mourn for yourself and the pain you're feeling, though - not because you miss him. I mean, please.

* Communicate with your friends. My two best girlfriends live thousands of miles away, and we text, e-mail, call, Skype, whatever we need to to stay in touch. Bonus: They're fucking hilarious. Remembering who will love you no matter what is a great thing to rely on at this time.

* Fuck other people, or do NOT fuck other people - but don't half-ass it. You'll just get into some painful, strange crush situation. This is either a time for NSA sex, or a time to focus on other things.

* Focus on other things. Read, exercise, make some godforsaken recipe on Pinterest, do a juice cleanse, start meditating, get a new vibrator, organize your closet by season, shape, and color. Knit. I don't care, find something. /r/uselesstalents is pretty cool.

* Stay. The Fuck. Off. Of. Social Media. I don't dare use social media if I'm not feeling 150%. I go on 2-3 month fasts a few times a year regardless of my psychological chops. You can read Buzzfeed and HuffPo on your own, and you don't need to see Carmyn The Hottest Coworker Ever post bikini pics from her Fiji honeymoon in February or whatever.

* Do something for someone less fortunate than you. Volunteer at a soup kitchen. Check out Big Brothers/Big Sisters. Buy the homeless guy outside of Starbucks a $5 Starbucks card. 

* Do yoga.

* Allow yourself to feel your feelings so you can move past them. Breakups suck, but they do not have to be life-defining unless you choose for them to be.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,DIY,1390538703.0,"Honestly? I'd say Urban Outfitters was the godfather of this trend. They were the first major business (that I can think of) that purposefully designed their stores to show the open duct work and exposed brick. It probably has to do with the trend of artists and ""creative people"" moving to cheap housing. Because they are creative they are able to make a dilapidated factory into loft spaces that you would actually want to live in. People see this and replicate the look because they like it.

It also could be a reaction to the crisp clean look of scandinavian, mid century modern, and straight modern home decor.


The green movement kind of plays a role in this in that repurposing and recycling furniture has been popular. The economy also has influenced decor with DIY and reusing older pieces in order to save money. 

Finally, in the US at least, home decor was very influenced by middle eastern design with layered looks using suzani prints and morrocan tiles (OP's curtains are a great example of this trend). As fashion goes, the past year flipped to an embrace of a ""new americana"" where all walls were painted crisp white and texture was highlighted. Therefore old woods, cast iron and varying tones of metal, and historical pieces have been more popular. 

I'll admit, I like re-appropriating industrial items. I think you are right that there is a nostalgia tied to it. As the world goes digital there is something comfortable about the machine age. It's definitely romanticized, but I don't think it should be dismissed.  "

Sorry about that. I do want to get to Argentina one of these days. I wish I could take a vacation right now, I'd bring you some USD. 

&gt;She didn't talk of the dollar prices, nor other pressing problems like energy (the lack of it). She announced another subsidy to help the people between 18-25 yo that are not studying not working.

It sounds similar to what Hugo Chavez is doing. Sorry you're going through this. Unfortunately if they dont change course right now things will probably get worse before they get better, but lets hope not.

Take my advice with a grain of salt, because I have never went though this. But you said most of your savings are in Pesos. Are there any commodities or durable goods that are readily available that you could put your savings in (obviously something that you think will hold its value)? I read about Venezuelans buying cars to combat the falling blolivar. Or would you be able to buy USD for a reasonable price? Keep in mind if the peso keeps falling it might be better to buy dollars (or something else) now rather than later. Keep in mind, I've never went through this, so my advice is not based on any real life experience. 

Sorry, I'm not trying to intrude in your business too much, but someone mentioned people's life savings evaporating and it really pissed me off, and then made feel really bad. Even if something is not the perfect investment, it might be better than holding pesos. "
frackaracka,worldnews,1390538722.0,"&gt; The truth is, women in india are finding their feet, which is why the men(the useless kind) are feeling even more useless and are giving them a really hard time.

I agree. But the regressive attitude towards women isn't limited to these useless men. I'm sure there are many educated boys eve-teasing (aka sexually harassing) girls thinking it's all in good fun, without realizing just how awful they are being.

&gt; india being a traditional agricultural society, women did a lot of heavy lifting and during the mens cycle they were prescribed rest. Since Hinduism is a way of life this became a part of religion at some point and is followed blindly by some nuts.

Yes, I figured that was how it originated. I don't think that's so bad myself. I mean, I've definitely had those days where my period was so bad I just wanted to call in a sick day at work!

But the fact that this has transformed into a ""women are impure"" says a lot about the direction the culture went in. Even if a family is not super-religious, what does it say about the culture when they don't allow their menstruating daughter to participate in a puja - not because she is impure, but because they don't want to risk the chance of any ""bad omens""?

&gt; again, this mentality will die out very soon as women get educated and get employed productively.

I agree, with some caveats. The West underwent a similar revolution when women joined the workforce in droves. But unlike the West, India is facing a highly-skewed sex ratio. And having large groups of uneducated, sexually frustrated men is a tipping point towards instability and disaster. I'm hoping that eventually things get fixed but the propensity for more violence at this point is great."

asoiaflover,TumblrInAction,1390538801.0,"There is a point that sometimes an author's viewpoints can sometimes come out in their work. For example (of really shitty writing) is the Twilight series. It isn't religious, but some common themes really stand out. For example, the insistence by Edward that him and Bella be married before they tried sex. And the fact that Bella didn't even consider for a second aborting her incredibly dangerous pregnancy (which, to be fair, even non-religious women who are pro-choice sometimes choose to go through with a seriously medically dangerous pregnancy, but I think the anti-abortion message was loud and clear). This person DOES has a point that sometime, especially if you're a crappy writer, your personal opinions can easily be detected and overshadow the story and plot. This also happens with author insert characters at times.

BUT, this person doesn't seem to realize sometimes the SETTIING can be inherently unfair and prejudice, and that doesn't mean the author is. For example (username relevant), the setting of A Song and Ice and Fire is patriarchal and violent, as well as other unsavory things, and things like rape, sexism, relationships and domestic abuse are not treated the same way that they would be in a modern, non-fantastical setting. That's the distinction that these SJWs don't understand. If you have a patriarchal, typical medieval attitude Crapsack World, of COURSE the character that was raped isn't going to be treated well. That's how that world (and ours in some areas) works. You'd have to be a horribly poor writer if you wrote a story set in Ancient Egypt that had racial sensitivity by the people from the dominant culture towards slaves, for example or gender equality in a medieval setting (though it is fine to have the odd more progressive character, it's simply poor writing and bad characterization to have them *too* progressive or to have the majority of characters and the prevailing attitude of the setting to be completely non-racist and sexist). 

That doesn't mean you can't show that it's wrong to have those attitudes, though. The SJWs have no sense of subtlety, you can especially see it when they criticize ASOIAF.  There is one scene where a woman is punished for promiscuity/infidelity by being forced to walk naked through a city street. Is that a sexist treatment of the character by other characters? Of course it is. Is the treatment of the character shown as something normal/accepted in that setting? Yes. Does that mean that GRRM is a massive sexist who hates women and wants to humiliate them if they are promiscuous? Of fucking course not. If you actually bother to notice tone and effect, it's damn obvious that even this villainous character being treated this way isn't okay with GRRM in real life, but he is an excellent writer so he wrote it realistically in the story. It's the same thing with his rape scenes, or his violence scenes, or the way patriarchal relationships work within the series. I think that GRRM is one of the LEAST sexist male writers I've ever read. Not only does he have real, compelling, well-characterized female characters, his writing skill is such that he can show the reality of how this poor treatment of women in this setting affects women (and men) negatively. And he has both female villains and female heroines, none of this ""women are perfect"" bullshit that characterizes poor fiction that tries for ""anti-sexist"" characters. Real women who are not SJWs don't want to read glorified, pedestal-sitting heroines, we want to see women like ourselves. I believe it's quite the same for PoCs who aren't SJWs, or GSM people who aren't SJWs. People who enjoy fiction want realistic, well-rounded characters, not condescending stereotypical borings ones, even if they are ""positive portrayals"". 

I always think the SJW must be bored, all the time, since they can't enjoy excellent fiction if it reflects reality in any way."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390538870.0,"As cliche as it sounds, time is the best answer, and the only way to do that is to cut off all contact.  Once you realize it's actually over, pretty much cut them out of your lives.  

If it's an SO, get rid of the pictures you have in your room, even texts or emails if you want.  It's only going to take longer to get over them if you keep looking at all the stuff that reminds you of them.  Sometimes it's hard because with mutual friends, you might end up seeing each other, but try to keep that to a minimum, at least initially.

Also, going out and doing fun things is always good - go to parties, go play trivia with friends, just get your mind off your SO and show yourself that you don't need them to enjoy yourself and have a good time.  I can tell you from experience that staying home and sulking *does not work*.  It sucks to leave the house sometimes and you just want to stay at home and do nothing, but it's not going to get you better.  It also helps to get out of the mindset that you need that person, that they were perfect, they were your life, all that kind of stuff - it's done with, it's over, even if they were perfect, it doesn't matter anymore.  Stop thinking that way or you'll be one of those people that still isn't over their ex 5 years later.

FWB - honestly, I don't have experience, although I'd guess it would be similar.

Friend - friends are tough - sometimes you just need to realize that the friendship is over.  It's harder with friends because with an SO, it's clear, but sometimes with a friend, there's a falling out or things just slowly break away, and you don't necessarily know why or what happened, or if things *really* need to be over.  But usually, deep down, you know things are done with, so just do you best to realize it's over, and move on.  Again, being around other friends and talking with people always seems to help me, so do what's best for you, but I think that would work for most people.  Losing friends is always tough because you don't really go looking for new ones (although I suppose you could).  I've had it happen a few times, just drifted away from people that I really cared about, and it sucks, because the friendships were great.  Sometimes they're worth salvaging, but if not, then do your best to learn to accept that."

Just to recap, /u/mr_traphouse said

&gt;It looks nothing like blood, more than likely its transmission fluid or beat juice

and you responded with

&gt;Either one is considered a Hazardous spill and police should be notified.

So, I totally reasonably thought you were saying that either transmission fluid *or* beet juice would constitute a hazardous spill, and as a result- made a joking comment lambasting the idea that something as benign as beet juice could be considered hazardous. 

You then proceeded to accuse me of having a god complex because I apparently ""knew"" it was beet juice, despite never saying anything to that effect. 

To which I responded with more snark- asking how ""either"" in that context didn't include the beet juice.

And finally, your response at this point was where you actually clarified what you meant, and get this- before that, I had no idea that's what you were saying, because you hadn't done that previously. This was accompanied by a bunch of fairly unrelated information about reporting things to the proper authorities just to be safe, and I mostly just ignored that, because I'm not really sure what it had to do with me making fun of the idea that beet juice is a hazardous material.

It sort of just devolved from there when I defended my initial comment by clarifying that your use of ""either"" in that initial response had needed qualification for it to be clear- and made a crack at your lack of clarity, mostly out of being defensive because of the way I read your response as being accusatory of me being the one to misrepresent what you were saying. I'm not going to go into what happened after that, but I'd like to think you absolutely losing your shit at me in your next response somewhat vindicated my continued snark, even if my last comment had been somewhat over the top."

dodgermask,explainlikeimfive,1390539088.0,"From a psychology perspective, we're unsure but there are a number of theories out there. 

Learning theory: Sexual arousal is paired with an object (you look at something, happen to get an erection, masturbate to completion), the object is then associated with ejaculation, there's anecdotel evidence this can happen in one trial (only needs to happen once to become a fetish).  This has been experimentally proven Rachman, 1966.  They trained men to become sexually aroused when viewing shoes.  

Second theory: Cognitive approach.  Essentially says people have distorted views that lead them to view usually non sexy things (like shoes) as erotic.  The way they view arousal is also distorted and they will not only engage in sexual behavior but also feel guilt and self loathing when doing so.  This creates a chain where guilt leads to engaging in fetish behavior.  

Third theory:  Sexual addiction, pretty much it's a compulsion that people do like any other addiction, just for a specific object.  

You can decide for yourself, but I'm most sympathetic to the behavioral account.

courtFTW,SubredditDrama,1390539137.0,"Yeah, most of reddit claims to support LGBT rights, but that doesn't stop them from using slurs, making fun of gay people, and insisting that they act straight, does it?  And TiA is *not* supportive when it comes to sexual orientation- not in all cases.  They make fun of asexuals a lot- namely, those that identify as demisexual.  And you know what?  I used to as well.  Then, I talked to someone who identified as demisexual.  I actually told them that it was a bunch of made up tumblr bullshit.  And they *set my ass straight*.  I realized that a) I was being a *huge* asshole and b) it's not just some tumblr creation- I was making fun of a group of people who finally found something that they can identify with.

TiA often pretends things like rape culture and cultural appropriation aren't real.  The last straw for me came around Halloween.  You can actually go through my history and find it.  They were making fun of a Buzzfeed post that pointed out that it is wrong to dress up as Native Americans for Halloween.  In typical form, the commenters were saying ""omg white sjws have so much time on their hands, natives don't care, we'll do what we want"" and I responded by saying and even explaining, quite calmly to them, I'm a Native American and yes we do mind.  This is not ok, it's offensive.  I was promptly downvoted, called an idiot, written off, and told to ""go back to tumblr"".  That did it for me.

TiA users claim to laugh at ridiculous ideas, but, in reality, they want to laugh at other *people* that they deem ridiculous.  They are a very close-minded group, and anything that doesn't fit into their narrow worldviews is ""sjw bullshit"".  The fact is, social justice is a *good* thing.  The goals are great.  Sure, tumblr can get a little bit out there.  But it will never be as bad as TiA."

I take it that you know that the fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, where you start with one, and the next number is the result of the two previous numbers, right?

So  
1 (+0) =  
1 (+1) =  
2 (+1) =  
3 (+2) =  
5 (+3) =  
8 (+5) =  
13 (+8) =  
21 and so on.

The circle in your picture is made by creating squares with a sidelength in the fibonacci sequence, and setting them down next to each other, in order top, left-side, bottom, right-side, top, left-side... etc. (or you can go the other way around.

The last thing the gif shows is the successive division of the numbers by the previous number, and how the result of that division converges ever closer to the number known as ""the golden ratio""."

CaspianX2,AndroidGaming,1390539458.0,"&gt;The loading in this game is not done very well because of what I think is a bug in the engine I am using

This may be, but remember that if the game crashes, your players won't care *why* it happened, they'll only care that it happened. And a game crash is not the sort of bug players will dismiss lightly. In fact, at this stage I think that the crashes are easily your most serious problem. I'd suggest checking either the documentation for the game engine you're using, checking to see if others using the game engine have had this issue, or contacting the engine's makers to see if they have any advice. In the end, if you cannot resolve this issue, you may want to change to a different game engine. I know that's a huge hassle, but if the alternative is releasing a buggy game that people dismiss outright due to crashes, it may very well be a necessary evil.

&gt; I will add an option for this. I kinda thought it made movement look more realistic, but it takes a big hit on performance.

You may want to ask around to see how other people feel about this. No one ever wants to give up a feature they put hard work into, but if it's not being received the way you wanted, it may be more trouble than it's worth, *especially* if it's causing performance issues.

&gt; I agree. The joystick is fairly unintuative, but I would need to find a new method of shooting.

Well, the method I suggested might be worth trying. You could also have the user draw paths outward from the character for the character to follow (while taps away from the character can be reserved for attacks). You could even use the accelerometer for movement.

The issue here is that the platform you're working on (Android) has strengths and weaknesses, like any platform. And just as it's rare to find a good RTS on a game console, it's rare to find a good action game on Android that requires multiple simultaneous inputs, unless we jump up to games that make use of additional hardware, and then you're both narrowing your target audience *and* putting yourself in direct competition with some big-budget games.

The webshow Extra Credits actually talks about this some in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBHircZu5EI&amp;list=UUCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) video.

If the type of game you *really* want to make just isn't a good fit for Android, you might want to consider doing it for a different platform. Starting on the PC is probably easiest and cheapest, and if you can get something decent working on PC you can bring it over to DSiWare, PS Mini, Xbox Indie, Ouya... basically, whatever valid platforms are available to you when you're ready. But regardless of how long it takes, the PC will always be there.

This isn't to say that what you're doing won't work on Android, or that switching to PC is your best bet. Far from it! Only you know what sort of game you want to make and ultimately maybe it's *perfect* for Android... but maybe it's not. And it is right *now* that you should be asking yourself these questions, not after you've sunk far more time and money into developing a game that conceptually would have been better off done in a different fashion, or on a different platform.

&gt; The walls were (aside from the player/menus) the only thing I drew for this game. I haven't even thought of this before, but I will look into also adding variation between them.

If art is a problem for you, you might want to consider bringing an artist on-board to help you with that facet of design. Now, I understand that budgetary constraints may mean that actually *hiring* an artist is beyond your means, but I tend to think that most people have at least one good friend who's at least *marginally* decent with Photoshop, and who'll likely be willing to do some quick work in exchange for a portion of whatever proceeds (if any) the game makes and maybe a meal or two. I mean, it's not like you're looking to design the Android equivalent of the Mona Lisa here, just get something passable that adds to your game rather than detracting from it.

The other possibility is that you could find a clever workaround that avoids any need for artistic skill. I suggested using runes as characters for just this sort of solution, but there are other ways to do this too - creating a game with minimalist graphics or pixel graphics, for example. No one will ever claim Pixel Dungeon is a graphical masterwork, for example, but it's pleasant to look as exactly *because* it embraces this simplistic style and runs with it. The same could be said for Doodle Jump, which has graphics that look like a child could have drawn them... but very clearly *intended* this.

However, what both of these games have in common is a *unified* design - everything in the game fits with everything else. If Doodle Jump had photographic backgrounds, or if Pixel Dungeon used geometric shapes as characters, the illusion of deliberate design would collapse. And while I know your circle character is just a placeholder, it's still probably a good idea to think about what your game will *look* like, and then try to focus everything on pushing that look.

For example, your backgrounds have some nice subtle detail in them... but that means that to match, your walls and characters should do the same. Now, this is doable even with poor graphical skills - just find fair use pictures of rocks and stones and that should do the trick. This is also why I suggested using stone monoliths as characters - it'll require little to no artistic skill, and result in a more unified look.

&gt; As for the rest I have somewhat of an idea of what a finished product would look like many months down the road.

Having a vision for your game is extremely important. Just bear in mind that you need to be at least a little flexible when you might be better off tempering that vision to offset or exploit quirks and difficulties you run into along the way. This is actually how we ended up getting the games Grand Theft Auto and Devil May Cry - both of these games began their life as *completely* different games until something unexpected was encountered that ran *completely* counter to what the developers were trying to achieve. However, rather than going back to the drawing board or trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, these developers rolled with the punches and changed things around to exploit these unexpected developments, and the result is two absolutely beloved multimillion-dollar franchises.

Again, I'm not telling you you need to change your game, make it into something different, or give up on the design you're trying to make. All I'm saying is, be prepared to change course if doing so looks like it'll make for a better game.

I hope it doesn't seem like I'm just giving you a lecture, and I *certainly* don't want to sound like I'm just complaining about things you're doing wrong. I just want you to consider all the angles and deliver the best game that you're capable of. :-)"

Paimon,LARP,1390539685.0,"I've been considering starting up at Underworld (assuming that it's the Ontario one) this summer, and I'm also a greatsword user.

Attack the slot. That is, the sword-side shoulder. Follow through with your swings. You don't need to swing harder, just don't stop swinging just because they've blocked you. That extra push is usually enough to put them on the back foot, which is important. There are two ways that they can protect against this, either they can block with their sword, which is awesome for you, as then they are not attacking you with it, or they can move their shield over and/or up. This is also good, as they will open up other parts of themselves to your attacks.

Attack that slot fast and hard. Nine times out of ten they'll start to pull their shield up in response to your knocking it further down. Once you notice them doing this swing for the hip or the other shoulder if they've exposed it. If they crouch down and turtle up, back up, and swing around them. If they have to crab walk, they are going to run out of energy. Keep hitting them. If they try to swing back, slap their wrist, and then go back to hitting their shoulder.

You'll need to master walking backwards as you fight, though being as aggressive as possible should keep people on the back foot. Also, you should get a sword that's as long as possible. Reach is your only advantage, and you'll need to press it. Underworld lets you make two-handed swords up to 72"" in length, that's over a foot longer than what you use (I tend to gravitate towards ~60"" myself). Reach is key, but make sure that your handle isn't too short, as you'll lose leverage and the sword will become awkward, my first great sword had only a 12"" handle, and it was awful.

Edit: This is a bit easier for me, as I'm left handed, but it shouldn't be too difficult to manage. Also, Underworld, if it's the same one that I know about, has rules for grappling. Get your red arm band, and then body check the shield. Then stab some more."

Charm_City_Charlie,lockpicking,1390539750.0,"Just found a manual and went through it, it doesn't have a power bypass for the front so you're stuck with the manual key override.

Unfortunately, it looks like picking it is going to take 2 full rotations of the 'key'. Additionally, the manual states that when unlocked with the manual override, the electronic mechanism is disabled and the key cannot be removed.

I read the above to mean that *potentially* you're going to have to pick it 4+ times in order to get it unlocked, then return it to a functional state, as you likely will have to pick it twice to get the two 'key' turns to open it - then *if* the electronic mechanism is disabled (despite the fact that there's no key in the keyway, which may not happen) you will have to pick it again twice to return the system to an active state, since the manual stating that the key can't be removed implies that it's also probably locked out of the keyway (so you can't just stick the key back in to lock it again when it arrives).  

Then again, once it spins free the first time, it may be smooth sailing since it could be locking the key in place with the set pins and not require subsequent pickings - who knows."

meanttolive,explainlikeimfive,1390539810.0,"IIRC from what I learned in school, it's a gradual process of taking something normal to making it a fetish. 

For example, a man is dating a woman he likes very much. The woman wears high heels often during their relationship. An association has been formed between attractiveness-high heels. 

One time the woman leaves on the high heels while they have sex. That association is strengthened. He comes to prefer her wearing high heels during sex. Sometimes she obliges. 

Each time she obliges, that connection grows stronger, while it becomes more and more difficult for him to feel the same attraction during sex when she's not wearing high heels. 

Eventually he begins to only engage in sex with her when she wears high heels. She realizes this, either does or doesn't care, and either stays or leaves the relationship. Regardless of her choice, the high heels have been sexualized and fetishized to the point where he cannot have sex without the heels present. 

Do you see that shift? When something shifts from a preference to a necessity, it becomes fetishized. 

Again, I could be mistaken but I definitely remember learning about this. "

That's an awesome way of putting it. Momness is a lovely word! When or how often do you meet mom? She might even have GSA to you also. So was it just a simple separation thing or was it messy and complicated? 

Don't mean to ask more private things, but just will say this: sometimes they're crazy and that can increase the possibility of incestuous actions, just that you don't want it too crazy where it just messes with you head or there are mental illnesses and drugs involved.

Then as you get older you discover that everyone is a lot harsher on a girl's behavior than a boy's. If a boy says something rude, he might get lightly chastised, but if a girl says something rude she'll be told it's ""unladylike"".

Rose_Stone,Feminism,1390540570.0,"I think gender studies are important. I think challenging norms about sex and gender and the constructs therein is important. I think that archaic gender roles are every bit as hurtful to men as they are to women, and all genders in between.

That being said, my experience with the men's rights movement is that it is, very simply, a hate group.

Those who proffer critical gender theory, journalism, and the like are not - in my experience - aligned with this group. 

I am a writer, and every time (literally: every single time) I write something suggesting a subversion of dominant paradigms and a re-thinking of our concepts of gender at all (whether an activist piece, a journalism-type piece, or a theoretical piece), I am met with vitriol and legit hate speech.

I am a huge, huge fan of men. But I put the ""men's rights"" ""movement"" and its ""activists"" right up there with the KKK: there's simply no way you're going to prove to me that you have a cogent argument that isn't based in hate. 

I think true ""men's rights activists"" are feminists/humanists. And I think the labels matter very little. It's all about end game and end goals. Additionally, I think many people - and all of the ""men's rights"" advocates I've encountered, if not most people - mischaracterize feminism and misinterpret a narrative they've learned from skewed views of history, policy, and goals. 

Feminism is humanism. Any -ism regarding our species ought to ultimately yield humanism.

The mural is neat and will be preserved, but it really looked like the other 67 'vert decklid I have in storage.  I was able to figure out that it was indeed from a 67 'vert, so I made arrangements to purchase it.  My friend who will be doing the metal work on my 68 westy fixed the dent and removed the custom latch and fill valve for an air ride suspension that was grafted into it.

raptorraptor,gainit,1390541072.0,"Found this after replying to you in the ""For the love of God, mods, please clean up this sub."" thread. Gonna be concise, cause I've already said some of this information in response to you earlier.

1. Fairly knowledgeable, I don't want to make out like I'm incredibly knowledgeable because I'm not, and I'm sure there's a least several people on reddit (especially in this thread itself) that know more, but I can offer plenty of advice to users and especially to beginners through stuff I've learnt both through personal experience and from reading the other fitness subreddits - and whatever articles I've read on the internet.

2. Most likely completely unknown. Unless somebody has a very good memory, even then you'd be able to count the number of people on one hand (or probably just one finger).

3. Whenever I feel I can offer advice, provided somebody else hasn't already said what I was going to say. I'm only in this subreddit itself every few days as it currently stands but if I catch a thread on my frontpage and there's room for advice to be offered, I'll definitely give it.

4. As I mentioned before, not very active. But I'm capable of dedicating more time if need be. I'd have at least an hour, most likely 2 or more come 31st Jan.

5. None with reddit itself. I moderated a couple of sites and game servers as a kid but nothing for the last 4 or so years really.

6. I am somewhat. I'm 2nd year CompSci and I had modules last year for web development, and during the summer break I dabbled in building a website for the fun of it, both using plenty of CSS. I'm going to assume that I'd find CSSing reddit to be incredibly easy, although of course I can't be sure of that. I can provide examples if you like but it's half 5 here so not going to go uploading stuff right now.

7. Mainly to help out. I could do a good job of being a reasonable mod and generally improving the place."

2) That's up to you and your conscience. I'm more the ""effect societal change"" type than the ""censorship"" type, although I understand arguments from all ends of the spectrum. That being said, hate speech is dangerous, especially if you believe that language is symbolic action.

3) I would emphasize common sense and perhaps a self-imposed avoidance of subreddits that aren't going to be useful or life-giving to your feminist friend.

Basically, I'm allergic to something in my saliva and tears. When my eyes water due to regular allergies it causes skin tearing under my lower lashes, which can be fixed by prescription eye drops, and also red, inflamed, flakey skin. My saliva is constantly causing dermatitis in the corners of my mouth (drooling in my sleep, sorry for the overshare...), and my lips are always either peeling (this is not normal chapped lips, the entire surface of my lips will peel over the course of the day), or the skin feels very inflamed and uncomfortable.

I've been to the dermatologist, multiple times, and he's stumped. He gives me cortisone cream and tells me to slather it everywhere, all the time. My optometrist isn't too crazy about me smearing steroids on my eyelids. I also use Vaseline liberally in an attempt to create a barrier between my skin and the moisture.

I know it's against the rules to ask for medical advice and frankly, I'm past seeking it. I have no idea what's causing these symptoms, I just know that they're incredibly uncomfortable. I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with treating dermatitis or uticaria, or any experience with skin inflammation that's responsive to steroids/cortisone and other products that work (unfortunately, natural alternatives to cortisones aren't as effective)?"

Junoh315,pcmasterrace,1390541549.0,"From what I saw of the combat system, it was based on a nearest-hitbox attack system where it highlights the area you will be attacking.  That's fine but the attack animations were pretty bad from what I saw.  They weren't as bad as Day One: Garry's Incident but they showed a lack of research.

Things like that can break immersion for me.  It's not exactly a deal-breaker but it's something I'd rather not deal with.

The game looks beautiful but do the levels hint you in the right direction?  Is there going to be a map system that will help you when you're lost?  If not then you'll need to think about adding things that will allow people to memorize areas easier.  Create unique setpieces in certain areas to act as landmarks so that people can map out an area in their head.

Other than this, I think there could be some work done on the video.  It was very much like an amateur video and I haven't seen many amateur projects succeed without having something unique.  Right now I'm not seeing that from your game.  You claim it's unique but do not sell it to your audience.

I think you'd benefit from a demo for the game or maybe some better gameplay footage that shows off attacking enemies.  You also do not mention any kind of loot or resource managing in the game.  No look at how you level up or the GUI either.

With the gameplay, make sure to put [PRE-ALPHA FOOTAGE] at the bottom so people know that it's not the final product.

I hope my input helps.  It seems like it might be a good game so I want it to succeed."

Rose_Stone,AskFeminists,1390541553.0,"(cross-posted from /r/feminism)

I think gender studies are important. I think challenging norms about sex and gender and the constructs therein is important. I think that archaic gender roles are every bit as hurtful to men as they are to women, and all genders in between.

That being said, my experience with the men's rights movement is that it is, very simply, a hate group.
Those who proffer critical gender theory, journalism, and the like are not - in my experience - aligned with this group.

I am a writer, and every time (literally: every single time) I write something suggesting a subversion of dominant paradigms and a re-thinking of our concepts of gender at all (whether an activist piece, a journalism-type piece, or a theoretical piece), I am met with vitriol and legit hate speech.

I am a huge, huge fan of men. But I put the ""men's rights"" ""movement"" and its ""activists"" right up there with the KKK: there's simply no way you're going to prove to me that you have a cogent argument that isn't based in hate.

I think true ""men's rights activists"" are feminists/humanists. And I think the labels matter very little. It's all about end game and end goals. Additionally, I think many people - and all of the ""men's rights"" advocates I've encountered, if not most people - mischaracterize feminism and misinterpret a narrative they've learned from skewed views of history, policy, and goals.

Feminism is humanism. Any -ism regarding our species ought to ultimately yield humanism.

Aang is fresh and ready to go. Blastoise and Charizard get curbstomped, most of their attacks being mercilessly countered, they stand little chance of beating him with their Normal type or special attacks. 10/10 Aang owns these fights.

Aang relies heavily on his Firebending to beat Venusaur, and his Airbending to counter Grass type moves. This is a more difficult fight but he still wins by a large margin. 9/10, this one is clear.

Espeon uses mostly Psychic and Normal attacks on Aang, this is his first real tough fight. It comes down to what attacks Espeon uses. I think Aang's monk training and heavily practiced mediation makes him resistant to stuff like Dream Eater and Psychic, but Espeon will still mess him up pretty good. Aang does get tired, so by this point his speed is waning against Espeon who is fresh and pretty agile. 

~~Espeon is weak against Fighting type moves so maybe Aang still stands a good chance.~~ I'll call it 6/10 to Aang, but depending on Espeon's moves it ""could"" go the other way.

Snorlax and Pikachu... Aang is in real trouble now. Pikachu is fresh and agile, Aang goes with Earthbending. Pikachu is weak against Ground type attacks. If Pikachu outmaneuvers Aang (who must be at least kind of tired by now) and scores a hit with lightning Aang is toast.

If Aang can keep up his Earthbending defenses and attacks he still stands a chance at beating Pikachu.

It's a toss up 5/5


Snorlax is fresh and resilient. Snorlax is a Normal type with a super diverse moveset. Aang really has nothing that is going to help him in this fight plus he's at the end of his rope. Snorlax's attacks land some hits and Aang goes down hard. Aang is a damn good Airbender, and really maneuverable, maybe he could evade long enough to land enough attacks to win, but I doubt it. 

Snorlax wins 7/10.


Red is probably going to win this fight. The order Red sends out his pokemon could also be a major factor in this.

But no: 

&gt;  the Electric field that lights the light bulb is created because the microwaves separate **negative and positive** electrons

and
&gt; Since water conducts electricity it multiplies the power of the microwaves and because the water touching the light bulb it send electricity into the bulb causing it to light up

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390541768.0,"[This article](http://www.jta.org/2013/10/01/news-opinion/united-states/pew-survey-u-s-jewish-intermarriage-rate-rises-to-58-percent) includes the particularly damning statistic of:

**Among inmarried Jews, 96 percent are raising their children as Jews by religion (as opposed to ethnicity), compared to 45 percent among intermarried Jews.**



Other stats:

- There are a lot more Jews in America than you may have thought â an estimated 6.8 million, according to a new study. But a growing proportion of them are unlikely to raise their children Jewish or connect with Jewish institutions.

- The proportion of Jews who say they have no religion and are Jewish only on the basis of ancestry, ethnicity or culture is growing rapidly, and two-thirds of them are not raising their children Jewish at all.

- Overall, the intermarriage rate is at 58 percent, up from 43 percent in 1990 and 17 percent in 1970. Among non-Orthodox Jews, the intermarriage rate is 71 percent.

- In the Pew survey, 90 percent of those who identified as Jews by religion and are raising children said they are raising them Jewish. By comparison, less than one-third of those who identified themselves as Jews of no religion are raising their kids as Jewish.

- Far more respondents said having a good sense of humor was essential to their Jewish identity than observing Jewish law â 42 percent compared to 19 percent.

* Approximately one-quarter of Jews said religion is very important in their lives, compared to 56 percent among Americans generally.


[Another article](http://forward.com/articles/177211/why-do-jews-intermarry-at-a-much-higher-rate-than/?p=all) states:

- Over the past half century, intermarriage has become increasingly common in the United States among all religions â but among Jews at a higher rate than any other.

- On the downside of interfaith marriage, Rileyâs research showed that intermarried couples reported lower rates of marital satisfaction than in-married couples. The children of interfaith couples also tend to grow up to be less religious than in-married couples.

**Warning, warning: Controversial personal opinion ahead:** If someone values being Jewish at all, in any way, I don't see how they could possibly agree to intermarry. Unless they are the statistical anomaly, it means that their grandkids won't be Jewish. And of course, everyone thinks they are the anomaly when the reality is usually otherwise."

You've both got different priorities and you're both going to have to sit down and find a compromise that works. Honestly, traveling together sounds like a fun and special idea. Maybe the location could use some agreeing upon but I would not consider it a ""waste"" of money.

The way I see it is: You want $7,000 for a family-friend celebration with wedding photos and everyone you love enjoying themselves for one special night. A lovely memory to look back on. Your boyfriend wants a week long adventure with you to make memories, visit exotic and romantic places that neither of you've seen before.. Both choices deserve fair consideration.

You might feel upset that he changed his mind, he sent your expectations and your wedding plans up in the air, but that's pretty much unavoidable in life. At some point you're going to butt heads over mutual decisions and this is that time. And that's exactly what marriage is all about -it's about seeing it from each other's perspective, finding a balance that works, and to talk it out.  If it's important to him then it's important to you or at least worth the time to discuss pros/cons. 

Possible solutions: Draw up a finance/cost spreadsheet to see where you can cut back on the wedding then allocate some funds for a vacation with a destination that's better for both of you. 

A marginally bigger wedding, where other funds are allocated to a road trip, closer to home, travel experience. "

I have a depressive disorder and have extreme anxiety. I have been in therapy and medicated since I was 13 (I'm 35 for reference) &amp; have always made it a point to be upfront about my shit because I know a lot of people do not want to get involved with someone with mental health issues. My bf was a little leary at first due to his history and rightfully so. It is probably one of the main reasons we didn't become exclusive until 7-8 months into the relationship.

What if Jill had big boobs, too? Boys want girls with big boobs, right? Just look at Kim Kardashian. Kim is a total tramp worth nothing to humanity, or so Jill thought. Paris Hilton is also a slut, a rich and famous slut. What about Lady Gaga? Nikki Minaj? Niall Horan? Jill thought about what was in common: all a bunch of harlots! Harlots with big tits!

So Jill got a boob job on Friday. Jill got mountainous, tantalizingly whorish tits, far surpassing Mary's still-rocking-but-sadly-not-as-rocking-as-Jill tits. Jill got tits that could block out our Sun!

Mary and Jill had a big sumo match, but with boobs. It was fun to watch and many dicks got hard and stiff. Jill won. Mary was sad.

So Mary sought out that boob-implant clinic again, but it got shut down by old haggish widows (from my first paragraph). Fuck old haggish widows and saggy tits.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390542243.0,"OP, I have experienced what you refer to as far as putting up with being uncomfortable. It took several incidents before I realized how much this upset me. Then I realized I need to 1) be more neutral towards men who approach me so that I don't ""lead them on"" by smiling and politely engaging in conversation and 2) be mean/assertive to guys who have started to make me uncomfortable. 

I think some of it is picked up from subconsciously observing the dynamic that women in our lives have with men, but a great deal of it is from how our behaviors are reinforced when we are kids. I think society rewards and emphasizes niceness with girls much more than with guys. Stereotypes about how girls are ""sugar and spice and everything nice"" tend to shape how we see ourselves. We get a lot of affirmation by playing nice, whereas boys mainly just get punished for being mean. Boys are trained to compete more openly and aggressively whereas girls are trained to collaborate in order to succeed. The way I made friends at school was by helping people and, well, being friendly with them. We played collaborative games like house or dolls, and when we got over we helped each other dress up for school dances and such. I think boys develop friendships in a more roundabout way, through shared experiences and healthy displays of aggression. Girls tend to be praised for how they treat others, whereas boys tend to be praised for what they achieve, sometimes at the expense of helping others. (Big generalization, I know, but I think it's fairly true.)

In tandem with this, girls are socialized to be passive. Girls tend to wait for/ask someone to help them if they are struggling, whereas boys tend to ""go for it"". Adults tend to hold girls' hands more, and girls get more support from their peers as well. Boys learn they have to fend for themselves. 

Meanwhile, we learn to deal with conflict passively. By the time girls are 10 or so, they learn to express mean ideas not through direct attacks (insults to the face, pinching, etc.), but through indirect attacks (gossip, cyber bullying, backstabbing, etc.). Boys are more trained in confrontation with their peers as they grow up. They deal with fights face to face. Part of becoming a man is learning how to stand up for yourself. The idea of a man teaching his son how to fight off bullies is so commonly portrayed on tv, but what about women teaching their daughters to fight bullies? We're mostly just taught to build a good support network and ignore the bullies.

Then we hit the age where guys approach us and it's sometimes the first time that we experience being nice as a flaw. We are used to thinking it will help us, or at least that it can't hurt. We realize we don't have much experience with direct confrontation. So we have to unlearn some of those tendencies from youth and train ourselves to turn our niceness on and off.  So, I do think we are socialized to be nice and non-confrontational, but I don't think it is that we are being socialized to put up with unwanted advances. The problem, to me, is that no one tells us how to deal with this type of situation. We tend to default to niceness because that is what we're used to. "

Tangentially related story: When my SO and I were long distance, he came to visit and had brought Gobstoppers (hard, round candy) with him.

Well, at some point after my SO left again, I found a Gobstopper in the crack under my front door. I have no idea how it got all the way over there, but it was nice to have that little reminder of his visit, so I left it.

Final-Hero,festivals,1390542392.0,"First off, The first and only CP that has happened was in 2012, it didn't happen in 2013 because TommorrowWorld secured the venue that CP used in 2012. That's why this year it is at a new venue. 

I've been to EZoo, Ultra, Waka, Aura, and still to this day I had the most fun at CounterPoint. Security was a breeze. The guy found my girlfriends piece hidden in her fanny pack and just looked at me, looked at her, and then told us to have a good time and put it back. No biggie. That being said, I also met people who said they got shit taken when it was found, so hide what you have best you can and you'll be alright. They just open your bags and don't even make you empty your pockets.  

The lineup was absolutely amazing. Great mix of artists during the day and I discovered a lot of acts that I'd never heard of or didn't know to much about. It was super easy to get around during the festival. One of my biggest pet peeves at Ultra was how they funneled you if you wanted to get to a different stage and it took FOREVER to get there because of it. Not at CounterPoint, super open. 

To address the comments about rain, yes, it rained on the second day, but when I say rain I mean like super storm. They temporarily had everyone leave and go back to their cars/tents. It honestly was super fun running through the rain with my friends and we laughed the whole way. Luckily, the rain happened early in the day and not at night. A little over an hour later the storm was gone and we all went back in. People had made a large art structure from cardboard in the venue and after the rain when we came back people ripped pieces from what was left and used it to sit on the ground without ruining their shorts/pants. It got muddy in some areas, but for the most part it wasn't bad. By the time the headliners came on you couldn't even tell that it had rained. 

Camping was car side, similar to most festivals as I'm sure you've experienced. Also the campsite was right next to the stage area, so you didn't have to walk a mile to get there every day. 

The best thing to do is try to catch an act that you've never heard of, they will probably surprise you. Also, bring a CamelBak. They gave out free water so its extremely handy to have one. I ate before going in, but they had tons of food for sale in the venue as well. 

The people were super friendly and PLUR was in full effect. Artists were spray-painting canvases around the venue for your viewing pleasure, and I can't wait to go back this year. If it was even half as good as it was in 2012, you're gonna have a great time. 

Tl;Dr Awesome fest, not so strict security guys (no cops), regular camping, and I'm pumped for this year.

The ACA had a pretty major effect on plans that didn't provide levels of service across the board that were established to qualify as a legitimate health insurance plan.  This may not be right, as many people may have wanted their plans to have the gaps it did, but many people didn't understand their insurance and were also impacted negatively.

LadyBugJ,AskReddit,1390542546.0,"Here's a comment by Hirsay that might not entirely answer your question, but it might help :)

&gt;""Habiru"" was--as far as we can tell--a derogatory term used to describe nomadic groups wandering through the fertile crescent. These would typically be displaced people, often of a violent nature. They would settle in occupied lands and cause great annoyance (and many times war) to their neighbors. Habirus (the term comes from outsiders) were usually led by a war-chief who could summon up many fighters in haste if needed. Local kings would try to get them to move if they became too powerful. (Think of the story of Isaac and Abimelech.) This description of a people applies fairly well to the one of Abraham and his descendants. If the *were* Semites in Egypt, they could easily have been taken as the annoying Habirus. And Abraham himself could have been an itinerant Habiru looking for a land to settle.

&gt;There are mentions of Habiru (called ""apiru"") by Egyptians around the dates possible for the book of Exodus, including some that dwelt in Canaan.

It really does depend on the sub, but often the comments can involve people linking to OP's gonewild pics, white knighting, being the demanding 'nice guy' or just being a sexist person in general. Sexism, objectification and the like are not accepted in any form on this sub, and as such anyone and everyone can post about anything and everything as long as it follows the rules and women can identify to it.

I use Linux Mint for most of my personal and school-work programming these days(work is another story, since C#/.NET). At the end of last year, I ran an experiment: I'd go without my Windows machine for the holiday break and only use my Linux Mint laptop (and since I was away from home, I could not renege on my self-made promise). In general, it was a good run. In any case, here are my opinions/observations:

* Linux Mint has a certain ""lag"" - barely noticeable, but it's there. Maybe it's just the age of my machine, but I noticed it enough.

* Photography is a major hobby of mine, can't live without Lightroom. Tried Wine, nope. Gave the best alternative, Darktable, a shot - comes a little close, but honestly, the features/user experience are worse than Lightroom 1.

* Despite the common (at least I've heard) idea that Linux reboots are infrequent, I found myself rebooting my machine quite frequently - perhaps more so than my Windows machine.

In the end, while I will continue to use Linux for dev work, I cannot stand using it as a personal desktop for an extended period, at least based on what I experienced. I found myself wishing that Windows had a package manager (I found Chocolatey, been playing around with it) and a better shell (Powershell is cool, but I love bash).

In any case, that was my experience. Feel free to agree or disagree!"

Gobizku,fatpeoplestories,1390542852.0,"&gt;It's fact though that he does this

The only fact you can be certain of is that if he's not gaining weight, then he is eating at maintenance for his caloric needs.  Additionally, as born-under-punches pointed out, resting metabolic differences between individuals typically varies 200-300 calories a day AT MOST.

It takes ~3500 excess calories to gain a pound (muscle or fat).  So if he eats 3000 cals one day and his body uses 2000, his body stores the other 1000 as muscle and fat (primarily gets stored as fat for inactive people).

Therefore, one can come to the conclusion that 1. he likely doesn't eat like that every day, 2. he probably didn't eat much else the rest of the day, and 3. he may be much more physically active than you think.

&gt;I'm not trying to argue

You're trying to convince us magic is real and that physics are a lie.  Fat is how your body stores energy for later use.  Calories are how we measure the available energy in foods.  Calorie consumption is directly related to weight gain or loss, specifically when you consistently consume more or less than your body can expend.

By claiming your friend can eat whatever he wants and gain no weight, you're actually agreeing with TiTP that weight is purely genetic, that calories have nothing to do with it.  When you make such a claim on a place that doesn't tolerate fat logic, yes someone is going to call you out on it."

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1390542859.0,"People have already mentioned the latest standards. There are two situations in which therapists/doctors/etc. ignore them. 

The first is therapists/doctors that are simply out of date and/or believe that trans people need to have a difficult time and have red tape and more barriers before they are allowed to get the appropriate treatment. In this situation, you can simply choose a different one. Find some local-ish trans people and find out who they saw. 

The second is socialized health care in which there are enforced guidelines. In these kinds of systems, all trans people are forced to see a very small number of doctors/psychiatrists, often at some kind of gender identity clinic. This happens in the UK to a smaller extent, but in a Scandinavian countries to a very large extent. People in those types of situations are forced to play along and jump through hoops or DIY HRT. 

It's really fucked up and cruel to force trans people to present as their gender (often in very stereotypical ways) in order to get permission for health care. 

Cis people don't need permission to have ten kids, get breast implants, join the military, or destroy their liver from drinking. Bipolar people aren't told they need to simply not be depressed or manic for a year before they get meds.

I don't know how I feel about KRudd, I agree that was a shit move on his part about the airline steward, but that doesn't mean the rest of his actions as a Prime Minister where wrong, Nor because I disagreed with Julia on some of her actions, was she a terrible Prime Minister. 

The reforms she pushed through where good for the country, the actions for the most part that KRudd did where good for the Country, Some of what Howard did where good reforms, (I don't like the gun laws, but I understand them, and for the most part, I think they have been good for the country)

It's time we (as a country I mean, not personally) stopped choosing our leaders based on their personalities, but by what they deliver for our future. I don't have to like my Prime Minister, but what they do HAS to be for the best for the Country and MAJORITY of it's people.

Not only were the girls walking away but they were refusing all phone number attempts by these desperate men. I ran up to them, and I mean I literally ran to them before they could get too far as we were already sort of far from that whole crowd, and introduced myself. They had no idea I wasn't with that group of guys but I asked where they were heading. They said they didn't know. I invited them to the party and asked the cute one for her number. She gave it to me and then the other girl asked me for MY number. We told them those dudes won't be allowed in and they can just party with us instead. They were down. All in all, bringing girls is as easy as just asking. Keep in mind, I didn't text any of them and instead gave the numbers to my frat buddy to talk to.

neekz0r,explainlikeimfive,1390543316.0,"&gt; But what about when the courts fail to do such and the peoples rights are CLEARLY being violated?

Theoretically, people would then elect officials that are more sympathetic to their rights. 

&gt; And I understand that people may peacefully assemble and protest, but what about when that has no effect?

Then they disperse and try again. In theory.

&gt; Are people expected to politely ask to stop being violated?

They are supposed to vote to elect officials that will stop them from being violated. Again, in theory.

&gt;  Or in extreme circumstances is violence ok?

That is an age old question. I will say this; many people believe that our rights are there to protect the poor and impotent from the rich and powerful. They aren't. When bread and circuses fail, the populace tends to behead the rich and powerful.

Lady_of_Shalott,LongDistance,1390543321.0,"&gt;And I am happy. But there's a lingering feeling of worry/fear/doubt. Is that normal?

Yep, sure is!

&gt;But I worry that subconsciously I'm mostly doing it because he's there.

Even if that is the primary reason, I don't think you should be unhappy about it. As long as you're not sabotaging your own life to be with him, why the hell not?

&gt;But even today he was talking about wanting to move after he graduates in a year... while I'm still in the program. Is that strange?

It does sound a little odd to me. But it's possible it hasn't really hit him yet, or his desire to move is less of a serious thing and more of a ""yeah, it would be nice to eventually not be living in this place I've been in for x years"" thing. Have you asked him about this directly?

&gt;I'm also scared that I'll move out there, and suddenly we won't work anymore. Has that happened to anyone?

Honestly, yes. But in that situation I had only been dating the guy for ~4 months and we hadn't actually met in person until I moved there (in hindsight, *really* stupid. But I was only just barely 19 at the time).

&gt;I could also use some advice about the logistics of a long distance move. Would it be a better idea to live on my own, or find roommates? Should I try to hang out with his friends or make a new group for myself? What's the best way to make a new group of friends? Any stories of a long distance move would be appreciated!

This is probably going to depend on your respective personalities more than anything, so the best advice I can give is broad and rather generic. Hopefully you guys have met in person at least once by now. Have you had any long-ish visits where you got an idea of what it might be like to cohabitate? Are you both the type to *want* to live together, or are you more independent types? How much have you talked through things like splitting up of household chores, habits that might conflict (e.g., leaving dirty clothes all over the floor when your partner is a neat freak), and so on?

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390543442.0,"The go-to adjectives when we describe girls and women tend to be things like sweet, nice, pretty, cute, beautiful. These may not be what people value most in us per se, but it's what's emphasized over and over in casual conversation. ""He's dating a sweet girl from his hometown."" ""She's such a sweetheart."" etc. We don't really have to be amazing to be called a sweetheart. People say it without necessarily meaning that we are nicer than the average person, they just say it to mean we are 1) normal and 2) approved of. So I think over time, the concept gets ingrained in our heads that ""sweet"" is the baseline we should aspire to. In reality, though, ""sweet"" is used synonymously with ""girly"". It doesn't seem relevant in most cases to note how feminine someone is, so they don't outwardly comment on it, but they take note of it subconsciously and come to the conclusion that they must be sweet. 

If most people were to describe a boy with a few random adjectives, they might say he's a good kid, smart, well-behaved, etc. It's all within the paradigm of the stereotype that boys are often troublemakers. To be a good kid as a boy, you follow the rules. You refrain from causing trouble. People don't associate girls with breaking rules as much, so to be a good girl implies being nice, refraining from conflict with peers. "

urfouy,AskWomen,1390543787.0,"Does anyone else just not really celebrate Valentine's Day?  Due to birthdays and anniversaries, our holiday season goes from Thanksgiving to late January.  By the time it's Valentine's Day, it's celebration overload.  The only part I enjoy is going on a date night, but we do that regularly anyway.

I like the opportunity to feel warm and squishy about my awesome boyfriend, but I don't need flowers or singing telegrams."
Dantilli,AskMen,1390543788.0,"The simple answer: they don't feel the need to put effort in anymore. They already have you as a girlfriend.

For some reason the socially acceptable method of relationships is to first attract someone by being the nicest guy you possibly can. Then, when you've been together for a while you can relax, be a slob and she'll be ok with it. It's almost like they're happy as long as they're getting the sex.

This kind of relationship is featured in pretty much every tv series ever (the older ones at least). The worst thing is that in them tv serieses, when the guy turns into the slob, **the girlfriend just accepts it**. There is usually a bit of a kerfuffel where they fall out for a bit but it's always resolved by an ""I love you"" which just does NOT work in real life (at least not nowadays, in my experience). It pisses me off more than you could know.

In reality a relationship takes some effort from both sides, consistent effort. But not because they are dependant on each other or because ""I have to because I'm in a relationship"". If you're doing it right, you don't NEED the other person in your life, you have a perfectly good life solo. But you WANT the other person in your life, so you must put in effort to make time for them. 

This consistant effort includes respecting basic common courteseys like performing bodily functions in private (unless agreed upon by all involved). It also includes doing fun things together, as the only reason you make time for each other IS to have fun and do lovey dovey stuff, you know, the romance. Simply because you respect your own time so if you spend it with them you want to do something worthwhile (to many people sitting in and watching a movie is worthwhile, don't start feeling pressured to do something amazing all the time).

Obvously he (every man you've met) has the first mindset of a relationship, that he doesn't need to put in the effort. You obviously understand the need to put in effort. All I can say is, if you have problems, to try talking to him. Don't be confrontational, but try and explain what's going on in your head. Also **listen to his side too**. Sounds condescending but GAH! the amount of problems that could be solved by properly talking things out is ridiculous. 

In the future try and determine what they think a relationship is about before you get into anything serious.

Hope this helps :)

TL;DR: They have a different idea of what a relationship is, an idea that is reinforced by media and tv. A relationship should involve consistent effort as you value your time and want to make the most of the time you spend with your SO. If you have problems, **talk it out**, but calmly and sensibly. Try and determine their idea of a good relationship BEFORE you get into one."

prodikl,justneckbeardthings,1390543877.0,"Well, I'm not a well-read randist or anything; I've only read Atlas Shrugged. Examples of charity exist in AS(atlas shrugged), but I think it stems from seeing virtue or ability in the person. There's a scene where the main character meets a homeless stowaway on a train, he sees that the homeless man keeps to his word and can get things done, so he hires him on the spot (iirc).

I personally think that homeless people or people down on their luck, as well as everyone, really, have something to offer; no one is useless. If I wanted to help them suceeed or get back on their feet, I think that's totally in line with her philosophy.

If someone is actively keeping themselves down or doesn't want to work to maximize their abilities, and I begrudingly give my hard-earned money (or time), then this would be the four-letter-word ""charity"" that people say she calls evil.

Left4Head,malefashionadvice,1390543893.0,"I worked at Aldo for 2 years and let me tell you some things.

They purposely make the bottom of the shoe smooth so you buy an outsole grip.

They make the insoles in the shoes super thin and uncomfortable on purpose. They sell you additional insoles because that's their money maker.

Aldo makes more profit on their insoles, outsole grip, leather protector, etc than their shoes.

Their shoes is something you call ""fast fashion"". It is poorly and cheaply made and falls apart within months. I had 9 pairs of shoes from there and threw them all out in less than 7 months. I had many customers come to me and co plain that they bought a shoe two months ago and it already fell apart. 

The pain the shoes cause is unbearable for some people like my gf and I. My gf literally threw her heels out on the street when we were in SF for NYE because it caused unbearable pain. I also had to go see a pediatrist because of foot and back problems that started with working with their shoes everyday.

Ever since I quit I have always been anti-Aldo and boycotting their shady practices because it isn't about the customer, it is about deceiving you into thinking you need something when the shoe should have already came with it in the first place. 

And NEVER buy a shoe full price. When I was there we had shoes go on sale from full price to 50% off in less than 2 months. "

nghtlghts,StudentNurse,1390543912.0,"Two weeks!! Give it more than two weeks! 

There's a lot of information coming at you real fast and it's normal to be overwhelmed. I spent the first 6 weeks of nursing school certain I was going to drop out. And I won't lie, I spent the next two years (of 4) wondering if I could make it, before I learned how to use a calendar, build confidence and get on top of my work. Just cause it's hard doesn't mean you're not cut out for it. You just need time to learn the habits needed to wade through it all.  

For studying: I usually had between 2 and 5 assignments or tests each week. I'd usually study 2-4 hrs (in one sitting) before tests and 6-12 before exams (sometimes spread over two days). Papers would take 3-6 hrs depending on length.

So all in all, I probably studied between 5 and +20 hrs a week. I work best by sitting down and working for a good 6 - 8 hrs straight, so I crammed a lot in school, YMMV, some people do better with shorter, more frequent study sessions.

TofuRobber,changemyview,1390543917.0,"Other's have made more convincing arguments than I will but I think the issue you should be looking at is the mere fact that Google is a huge corporation that has an enormous amount of power.

Everything that it does, good or bad, is for profit. Good products and good service will get them more money. Plain and simple. It doesn't matter if they are helping people or innovating new technology. It's great that they are, but that's no reason to ""love"" them. You must see them for what they are.

Google is so powerful that the government won't probably be able to stop them even if they wanted. Let's say that Google does something wrong and the government wants them to stop because it's wrong. Google says no. What can the government do? Practically nothing because so many people rely of Google for their services. Google can simply threaten to stop all their services and if they do, they have the support of all of their users behind them. That's the majority of the civilized world, not just those in the county, the whole world.

Of course chances of something like that happening is low, but that isn't the point. Google does good things and bad things. You have to consider both and judge Google both accounts. A right doesn't cover a wrong, nor 5, 10, 20, or a million rights. Their ultimate goal is profit, and if being innovative gets them to their goal then that's what they will do. If being charitable raises their reputation then they will do it. They do good because doing good increases their profits. It they were to do good for the sake of doing good they wouldn't be a corporation. At most, one can respect their business model. It should never get to the point where you simple love anything Google because, it's Google.

TLDR: Google is a corporation and should be treated as a one. They do good and they should be respected for that. They do wrong and they should be criticized for it. Neither are reasons for a person to love Google. They should be judged without bias and irrationally loving them doesn't change the fact that they are making money off you, which is exactly their goal. "

That's not to say there isn't a lot of liberal Catholics and specific churches that are not anti-contraception, or that evangelicals and other denominations don't sometimes do the same thing, but fact remains that anti-contraception laws and social problems happen in countries where the Church has a lot of either legal or social power.

ColloidMan5000,chemistry,1390544497.0,"There are three main things I wish I had known about. Firstly, the range of equipment your school has.

Is there equipment in a different faculty you can access? How easy is it to get access to? What are the technicians like that run them, are they experts or just trained monkeys? It very much depends what field you're going into, but this may be an important issue.

Secondly, how is the money? Are you likely to get a scholarship/stipend for your research? What about money for chemicals and access to instrumentation? What is the yearly budget per student, and how far does it stretch? Are you going to get half way through your first year and then be told there aren't any duckets left to buy the drum-grade acetone you want to wash your glassware with? 

Thirdly, what are the academic staff like? Are they all old and about to retire and be replaced by newbies who will bring the rating of the school down? Are they approachable? Are they world leaders in something? Are they going to be able to unload 50 years of chemistry knowledge onto you? Are they willing to help you?

She is a rude, bossy-ass bitch who thinks she knows everything and that she has the right to interfere in everyone else's business. The way she talks to Rand in particular makes me want to slap her. Despite the fact that his prophesied destiny is to die young saving the world, she completely disregards his feelings. She bosses him around, belittles him, and yells at him for *daring* to feel sad that he is going to die before he sees his 25th year. Not to mention how she constantly goes around with her nose in the air being smug as fuck and mentally masturbating over how much better she is than everyone else.

Robert Jordan fucking sucks at writing female characters in general. Almost every main or regular female character in Wheel of Time is either an insufferable bitch, a spineless 2D cut-out, or little more than a breathing sex toy.

I also think every character from Twilight is horrendous. That series is a great steaming pile of shit. The women in particular are fucking horrifying. Esme literally only exists to be a mate for Carlisle. Alice, as the series' ""deepest"" female character, enjoys such passtimes as makeovers and shopping sprees. Don't get me started."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390545095.0,"&gt;We are taught niceness and the golden rule, and hope that if we play nice, then THEY will play nice, which is not the case!

Exactly. I only realized this a few years ago. I have a feeling most boys learn this, probably gradually, while they are still kids.

I think parents teach boys to become independent in a much more deliberate manner than with girls. In fact, many parents resist the fact that their daughters will grow up, become sexually active, and so on. Fathers tend to try to take an active interest in getting their sons to do things on their own because it's part of ""being a man"" to be independent. A grown man who calls his dad to help him fix something in his house is somewhat emasculated, for instance. It's considered part of being a man to do it yourself. On the other hand, I have many grown girlfriends who call their dads to help them with random crap they could do themselves but don't want to be bothered with, or feel intimidated by.

I think I read a study once about gender differences when girls and boys do math problems. The girls tend to lose confidence when they struggle because they think something is wrong with them for not understanding a difficult problem quickly. They tend to sort of give up and ask for help. The boys more often take the challenge as par for the course and muddle through until they figure it out on their own. Of course, in math, learning how to work at a problem from different angles is an important skill, so over time they get better at doing so than the girls. Teachers and parents helping their kids with schoolwork probably unconsciously reinforce these tendencies by helping girls more directly than they help boys. In essence, boys are taught to teach themselves, and they learn more from it.

A lot of women tend to get intimidated by doing things they haven't done before, especially if they are in public. Their first instinct is that it is embarrassing to make a mistake. Nervous laughter, look around for help. Guys are more embarrassed to ask for help, but not as embarrassed at making mistakes. Hence the stereotype about how guys hate to ask for directions. They would rather stare at a map and figure it out themselves, even if it means getting lost. Another example is women who are intimidated by doing weightlifting. I think a lot of women aren't scared of the macho part, they're scared of it being obvious that they don't know how to use the equipment. I think girls tend to 1) think everyone is watching them and 2) worry too much about doing something wrong. It's a whole other discussion to parse out where these fears come from, but I think this is a big part of why girls don't learn to try things on their own. Those fears get reinforced by the people around us, rather than challenged.

Or think about when you are in a group and you need someone to step up to lead, offer a suggestion, or help solve a problem. In my experience a girl is more likely to wait and see who volunteers to do it. It's not really a matter of confidence, it's more a matter of girls feeling it is more appropriate or polite to go with the flow than to be the first to make waves. We don't want to overstep by asserting that we know the answer, because by golly that would be arrogant. We generally fear being labeled as arrogant much more than men do. And it's also a habit of submissiveness, basically. We feel that someone else must have more authority. I notice this with my adult girlfriends and at work as well. If there are guys in the group, the women are more likely to wait for them to take charge. I guess part of it is that they want to wait for a group consensus before asserting their opinion. Most women understand that this is how women go about decision-making, but men tend to attribute it to meekness.

You might find that you prefer a 34 band in some firmer brands, as your snug is just over 32, but for the most part, 32 should give you better shaping and support.

We do need more 'gun control' in America, but it's not the guns that need to be made illegal, the people carrying them need to be regulated. Mandatory mental health checks and better healthcare(Single payer would be best IMHO) and we need to reform our approach to how we treat mental health issues. Guns are fine to have if the person carrying them is a stable law abiding citizen. 

The criminals will find a way around the laws just like they do now. So if a criminal has access to ar-15's and such we are putting law abiding citizens at a disadvantage should someone rob their home or business with one.

Now, I'm not saying that both of these weapons are equally deadly that would be stupid of me. What I am saying is that this guy was there to inflict pain not death on this girl. He could have killed her with that knife at any point if he wanted to. People were essentially implying it is hard as hell to kill someone with out a gun, when that isn't really true."

drzoidburger,AskReddit,1390545447.0,"I don't know if this is the girl you're thinking of, but Claudette Colvin was the first person arrested on a bus for refusing to obey segregation laws. She was only a teenager at the time. She testified in court and was hoping to become a key figure in the civil rights movement. However, she became pregnant and was quickly hidden away from the public eye as a result. She faded into obscurity and lived a hard life. Her arrest and early pregnancy attached a lot of notoriety to her name that she never really escaped. She's actually still alive.

When I went to Mayport I had one too many cocktails and ended up *reaaaally* drunk, but other than that it wasn't anything to complain about. The bad news is, the most unsanitary person I've ever met is from Florida. He claimed to live in a swamp. He was pretty knowledgeable about cars, though, I'll give him that. *Anyway*, overall I really liked the atmosphere of Florida. It was a great change of pace compared to the desert nothingness of Arizona, and the people seemed pretty chill. Apparently they have amazing strip clubs. I've been to one, but honestly I'm not too crazy about wasting my money on objectifying women.

The real answer is for them to have a bit of originality in their naming. If they use a single english word for their name, they should know they're going to have problems. Use a misspelled word like Google did, or combine words like Fedex or Petco, or hell, since we're talking about scumbag game companies, make up your own word like Zynga.

- Clothes, shoes, sandals. I only have summery clothes, and not very much of them either.
- Toiletries.
- Computer, separate keyboard, mouse, dongles for programs and other work stuff.
- iPad, phone and quality earphones. These are for music, books, tv-shows, podcasts and all sorts of entertainment.
- Pipes and pipe tobacco. May not be essential to everyone.
- Set of juggling balls. Same as pipe tobacco.
- Passport, possible visas, credit card(s), banking papers, proof of travel insurance, etc. I have copies of all of this online as well.
- A little baggie I take any time I travel anywhere: Headlamp, earplugs, sleeping mask, Imodium, ibuprofen, a multitool of some sort, small amounts of cash money in useful currencies.

For the last couple of years I've rented furnished apartments both in Finland and here in Thailand, so there's very little I've had to get out of storage or store, but things like a floor fan and coffee maker go in and out of storage at both ends.

All I can say is foreplay, foreplay, foreplay, and and don't just stop sex altogether if he gets soft. Make his pleasure the center of attention for a while, without focusing on his orgasm. If he gets to a point where he's comfortable, you can try straddling him while he masturbates, and once he goes past the point of no return, he puts it in you and comes inside your pussy, which feels heavenly.

However if you enjoy you're sanity and want to minimize you're search I would suggest the following:
Set aside all larger pieces such as plates, large beams, the windows, the fabric for the roof etc. These are easy to find and distinguish.
Find all the small pieces, usually in their own bags, and put them into a bowl or bucket that you can easily sort through, you can also divide into colours depending on your preferences.

Now do the same for the larger pieces this time definitely sorting colours.
During this be sure to not leave any pieces in the bags or box.

There is not much else todo unless you really want to line up every single piece but that would take as long as searching and building imo.

Isolation is fixable and relatively easy. Easy in the sense that the effort is minimal but the act of getting of fear is what causes most of us to stay away. I know the feeling of just staying home alone because I know that I'm down and I don't want to burden others with my sadness. What helped me was faking it regularly. Fuck it.

lonelychaser,AskReddit,1390546373.0,"I really tried to like Red Dead Redemption, the entire concept seemed great to me. But as I played it I just found it a lot less fun than I was expecting. Maybe I expected too much like not seeing that damn skinning and flower picking animation over and over again. And not having to do all those boring farm missions. 

But even without that something about the game felt empty, more empty than other sandbox games. In part I think because in other games like GTA and Saints Row if I'm bored I can go on a massive killing spree and have a lot of fun with that. It's not the same in Red Dead Redemption. I was stuck in the story, which wasn't that great, or sidequests or exploring and finding almost nothing."

ruvb00m,StudentNurse,1390546406.0,"Study all the time, tired all the time, feeling burnt out all the time. No life outside school. Just keep going. There's a reason why nursing school has a reputation for being rough, because it's a full-time job in itself. I wish I could tell you that it'll get easier or that you'll never be stressed or anxious, but that's not the way it is. I have developed acid reflux and gained several grey hairs (I'm not even old). Tenacity is the best virtue here. The only thing I must add is that I never went through the first year of nursing school. I am a transition student, so I started during the second year of the current nursing class. My advice is to take some time for yourself every now and then, whatever (legally) makes you happy. Another thing I do every semester that I wouldn't recommend if you're not good at self-study or if your grade is based on attendance, is to skip a class every now and then. I tend to get stressed over the fact that I *have* to be in class so many days a week. Skipping class restores my sense of control, and I also get to sleep in so that I feel well-rested for studying that day. I would also recommend not procrastinating. I am still trying to break that habit and it's my last semester. Shit, I'm procrastinating as we speak."

Being from Arizona, however, I really think it comes down to where you *live* in Arizona. Tempe, Surprise, Sedona, and Flagstaff are all amazing cities. Glendale and Phoenix...not so much. So honestly my views on Arizona is really love-hate. The thing is, I'm sure *any* place you live has the good and bad sides to it. What I'm looking for, however, is a state that is great overall.

Also, I get that Illinois has high crime and it's cold as hell, but it's also a cultural melting pot and actually quite beautiful, be it naturally or architecturally...at least when I went to Chicago that is. I'm a fan of snow, so that's another thing that makes my perception of Illinois a little different from a lot of other people. **Not** a fan of racism, though. Or unemployment. Or lousy schools.

My girl is just very fidgety and gets distracted easily, but she is getting better with consistent training. Both of them have very nice movement and structure, the girl is also very typy, she's just the type of Samoyed that's in fashion in the show ring right now, so I work with them a lot because I know they can do well if they show well. 

&gt;As for breeders getting the pick of the litter -- they should, if the dog has a small litter and there's an extra person on the wait list, they should know from the start that they breeder has the pick of the litter. I've been through the situation, and lucked out because the dog I was waiting on ended up being the best dog out of the litter and the breeder kept it. I wasn't too cut, it gave me the opportunity to look at other dogs and breeders.

I agree, I will definitely be keeping a puppy from my girl's first litter if there is a puppy there whom I want to keep. I can't wait to show my first dog in the ""Bred By"" class, but of course it has to be a nice dog because you represent your kennel when you show in that class. "

Train ride into the city is 2 hours or much less depending on where. Not a long drive if you are just heading over the border.

I'll definitely look into those places, thanks!

&gt;The education in the area is excellent too, you have Yale, Quinnipiac, Albertus Magnus, Sacred Heart, Fairfield Univertsity, University of Bridgeport plus a number of smaller places and more within commuting distance.

Can't go wrong there. I'm still debating whether I want to go to a university or a technical college, but I'm leaning towards technical college to learn how to maintain engines. If anything, it's good to know there are a lot of educated people there. And yes, I can't think of any way of saying that without sounding somewhat rude. I apologize.

&gt;I saw someone on Reddit put it ""People down south are nice but not helpful, people up north are helpful but not nice"" People will go out of their way to help you and politely thank you if you do, but don't expect most people to be ""How are you doing dear?"" and if you are driving, the guy who doesn't flip you off when he passes is being polite.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1390547660.0,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom

Anyway, here's the thing. Workers rely on wages, to you know, eat. So when someone undermines your bargaining position, it undermines your livelihood. Since workers are desperate and less organized, and because of a labor surplus, workers generally don't have a good bargaining position and are exploited as a result. You might not see a problem with this in your abstract economic theories, but it hurts real people with real lives. You can't have a true free market if the relationship between workers and employers is unequal, as it often is. It becomes grossly one sided, and therefore exploitative. And here the scab comes along and undermines any attempt for the workers to organize and bargain for higher wages. Since someone is ALWAYS willing to do it for less, it's a race to the bottom that hurts everyone.

Also, check out the prisoner's dilemma, it's kinda like that. Cooperation produces the best long term results, but a lack thereof can produce short term gains at best and lead to a general loss at worst."

hubeijames,dragonage,1390548119.0,"I really don't know. My original DA:O playthrough was with a Dwarven noble rogue, who was very light on mercy and patience, and very heavy on tradition. Most major campaign choices were the ""good"" ones, but she sided with Harrowmont, destroyed the Anvil, executed Zevran, didn't recruit Leliana, didn't do the ritual, and while she made Alistair king, she gave him his wish to sacrifice himself against the Archdemon.

But is this what I want to be canon? Not only did she royally fuck over her own people by Kinging Harrowmont and destroying the anvil, I killed a bunch of companions. I have the sinking feeling that a lot of these choices will lead to less content, not more, in Inquisition. 

I have another full playthrough with a generically ""good"" Elf warrior who romanced Alistair waiting just in case. (I never did do an ""evil"" playthrough; never could come up with a character concept that would justify purging the Circle, killing the Dalish, or in DA2 siding with the Templars over the Mages).

In either case my DA2 will be a female Hawke who romanced Anders and sided with the Mages. I played her as a warrior, but might change her to a mage just because it makes more sense in my head."

honestbleeps,AskMen,1390548240.0,"it's probably pointless to reply with this many comments already here, but I can't sleep, so what the hell.. I'll add something that hasn't been said...

[this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1vy5z6/how_come_there_are_so_many_guys_out_there_who/cewwh3r) sits very deservedly at the top.

However, I can add a bit more to that...

First and foremost: some of us just aren't particularly attractive, or we're just unattractive - just like some women.  Sure, for most people that just means some smaller percentage of people might find them attractive - nobody's ugly to *everyone*... 

However, people are superficial in their taste, and both men and women are guilty of mostly being attracted to... well... the most attractive people...

Let's say a guy is a 4 out of 10, for the sake of argument...  That doesn't mean that he's attracted to 3's, 4's and 5's. He's still looking at 10's and 9's and 8's and 7's because that's what appeals to him.

The vast majority of people tend not to date significantly below their own attractiveness, so to this guy who's a ""4"" - only a tiny fraction, maybe even ZERO of the people he's attracted to will find him attractive.

Now, take that top commenter's observations on guys never being complimented, never being approached, and even a guy like me who has been in several long term relationships and not been ""alone"" for long periods of time is going to have self esteem issues.

I'm probably that ""4"" I described above. I've always had to do the pursuing, and I've never once felt that a woman I've dated was attracted to me until I ""won her over"" - in part because I had to do all the work / chasing / wooing / whatever, and in part because I'm just objectively not all that attractive.

This is reinforced by friends, relatives etc always acting surprised when I introduce them to an attractive date -- happened when I was young, happens now in my 30s...  You get that ""wow, how'd you manage that?"" look, and not so subtle comments implying your interpretation of that look was not at all incorrect.

TL;DR: it's normal for lots of guys to feel like they don't attract women for a myriad of reasons... in some of our cases, it's because we just DON'T. Doesn't mean we're going to die alone, so long as we get out there and try anyhow (I'm getting married in 6 months to an amazing woman!) - but it's incredibly difficult for a guy to feel attractive unless he's near the top of the scales..."

shitty_memory_,changemyview,1390548258.0,"Okay, so at first I though you were a troll, but i'll attempt to change your view.
not every relationship is initiated because the man made the move. Its more common for sure but not 100% of the time. I know plenty of women who have made the first move and are in happy relationships. As for the women being able to leave whenever she wants so can the man.
As for the horrible things men have done to women, not all men have or ever will do terrible things to women. And women are just as capable as doing terrible things to men, maybe not sexually but certainly emotionally. But the things some men have done to some women is not usually on a womens mind when shes with someone shes interested in. And sex for the most part is a very intimate thing and women certainly don't just do it for reproduction. Otherwise they'd never have sex.

About attraction, just because you can see when a man is aroused and you cant see when a women is aroused doesn't mean they're not aroused as much as men if not more sometimes. Some women have a high drive and are more easily aroused than others. But women love men and the way then look, its just different aspects of a man then men find in women. As far as love, women can love just like men can, because at the end of the day, we're all human beings capable of the same emotions, whether its fear, happiness, anger or love. And I can say from personal experience I have loved a few men in my life and loved them very much and its unfortunate things took us apart but I look forward to loving another person in the future."

If you're in the US, there are two parts to this:

1. You need an export permit from the ATF to export the sights from the US as they qualify as firearm parts (essentially, anything that attaches to a gun).  You will also need to pay a transfer tax.  There are companies that have permits who will export them for you, but they take a big fee that will quickly eat your margins.  It is my understanding that you need high volumes to make the economics work for getting a permit yourself.

2. Your German retailer/distributor will need an import permit.  My advice here would be to find a distributor who already imports other firearms/firearm parts.  If the interested retailers do this directly, they should be familiar with the paperwork."

As it has a superconductor which is used to transfer the energy in the system it doesn't have any resistance and thus it probably wouldn't overheat. I guess the crystals also don't have a maximum of energy they can channel so it would just make the blade ""stronger"".

Most of us here are transgender, meaning we actually feel like a different gender. Most of us also transition or want to transition, which means steps toward living as a different gender. 

There are so many variables in the experiences we as transitioning transgender people have. Someone who has very strong visible beard shadow, hasn't been on hormones, and a very masculine face is going to have a harder time getting people to accept them as a woman than a slightly built person who has spent two years on hormones and who had an androgynous face to start. There's also a lot of variation in where you live and what kind of people you spend time with. 

So I can only talk about my own experience. I have never had anyone confront me about me being trans. No one has ever looked at me funny in the ladies room. No one has ever told me they had a problem with me playing on a women's sports team. My co-workers remember when I used to look like a bearded man, but none have ever harassed me. I have never had a problem renting apartments, or getting service at a store. No one has told me that I'm an abomination on my way to hell. The absolute worst thing that has ever happened to me by a stranger is pointing out that my voice sounds male. My family is not okay with it, but they have no choice in the matter, so they are pretty good with using the right name and pronouns. So I have had no real bad experiences in the nearly three years that I've spent living as a woman. In a different place, looking a different way, my experience would likely be different. "

This will be the first purchase of mine from Hourglass. I didn't really want any of the Ambient Light powders; I have plenty of finishing and setting powders as it is, and none of them really stood out to me except *maybe* Ethereal, and now that I can get Ethereal mixed in with the perfect color (pale pink) blush, I'm all over that.

TofuRobber,changemyview,1390548662.0,"Correct me if I'm wrong. 

You are saying...

* Cherry picking is fine and should be encourage in religious text if it teaches a person how to be a better person.
* Religious societies do as much or more good as the amount of bad that has been committed.
* Radical atheist are biased in their views and hold preconceived notions that any person who is religious is unworthy to talk to.
* Following a religion does not mean you are forced to abide by everything that the religion states because times have change and religions should too.


1. I agree that if a person learns to be a better person by cherry picking then it's a good thing. However, cherry picking itself is wrong. Every single passage in any book is context based. If it can be used for good then it can also be used for evil. Ex: Last supper, Jesus say's ""This is my flesh eat it. This is my blood, drink it"" (I'm paraphrasing here). If I were to take this out of context then I can argue that Jesus wants us to eat the flesh of people. Cherry picking is inherently wrong even if it can do good because it causes specific phrases to lose their meaning which can then be used in a multitude of purposes. /r/nocontext is a great example of the humor but it also shows how dangerous cherry picking could be.

    You do not need to rely on religious scripts to learn morals or be a good person. Sure they can be used but they are not necessary. You don't need sticks to teach a child how to count. They'd could be useful but you don't them. If you wanted a story about a man doing a good deed to teach a moral then you don't need religion to do that. You can take religion out of a man doing good and the man will still do good. You can't take the good man out of religion and still have a good religion.

2. History shows otherwise. Many major wars throughout history were under the banner of religion. But regardless of that, you do not say that a man is morally even if his kills a man and then saves another. Your argument is flawed. Just because religion also does good, it doesn't excuse the fact that it still does bad. If religion is the cause of people still holding bigoted views regarding human civil rights then religion is responsible for it and no amount of good deeds by any amount of people can change that. If religion continues to oppress people and objectify them the millions of lives that they may save doesn't right their wrongs.

3. I agree. I think that those types of people are bad, wrong, and closed minded and are doing more harm than good. I also think that any religious equivalent could be just as bad or worst. For me at least, as long as the radical atheist continue to spread the importance of science, skepticism, and empirical evidence then I can tolerate them. Religious equivalents don't seem to value those things as much. I personally don't care if people are religious but if they use religion to as an argument when there are valid science to prove or disprove what they say then I get annoyed. This applies to people using bad sources, bad science, and spreading false information, so religion isn't exactly alone there.

4. Yes you don't have to follow the every word of a religion, but if that's the case then why are you even following that religion? If you are simply picking out what you like and discarding what you don't like can you really say that you're truly following the religion? If a religion tells me to kill my first child if it's a girl, and if I don't I will have committed a great sin, but I think that it's total bull and don't follow it, what is to say that my choice there have not just condemned me, but also every person who knew my decision and didn't stop me then? If people say there is a heaven but no hell what have a religion in the first place. It's like playing a game of Simon Says except you only choose to do what you want instead of actually doing what Simon Says. There's no point in playing.

   You say that religion should discard the bullshit when it sees it. Well there's still a damn lot of bullshit still there. Gay's are less than human. Women are inferior to men. Slaves are acceptable. Rape is okay. Killing is bad, but only if they like the right god. Some people are more equal than others. Family is second to God. Certain animals shouldn't be eaten but everything else is fine. Religious text advocate these things. People may not live by them but they are there.

   Look at it this way. Discard the bullshit is your answer correct? Well if you're going to discard the bullshit in religion why not just call religion bullshit and discard it all? There's nothing wrong with people living how they want to. But if living how they want impedes certain humanitarian movements then how those people live needs to change and justly so. That or go somewhere else and live in their own society by their own rules.

dianthe,dogs,1390548846.0,"&gt;I can't wait to be able to participate in the bred by class -- here in Aus, most judges look for balance. I know Rottweilers like the back of my hand, so I'll be looking for a pup whose parents are well boned, muscled and have good movement.

I did the same with my girl, I wanted a girl of a particular type, with nice big bone (which is a very big thing in Samoyeds at the moment though it wasn't always), movement more on the flashy side (because again that's what is winning at the moment) but still clean, with good angles (you see quite a bit of bad angulation in the ring so I wanted to steer clear of that) etc. And she is almost exactly how I imagined her, I am very excited to be showing her. [This is her](http://imgur.com/gjMe5DQ) :)

With my boy we weren't looking for a show dog, we just wanted a healthy dog with good temperament, we found a breeder whose type of Samoyed we liked and who did health testing on both sire and dam, that's how we got Orion. Little did we know at the time that the type that's our favorite (more old school) is not what's in fashion in the ring right now. I decided to start showing Orion just because it seemed exciting and his breeder was supportive of it, then I got hooked lol Orion is more of a working style of dog, he has solid structure, balanced and clean movement (not flashy), amazing coat texture (you see a lot of incorrect coat texture in the ring), good angulation, however he has a lighter eye color (still within the standard just not the preferred dark eyes) and he doesn't have very thick bone. [This is him](http://imgur.com/wnLHnMD)

Basically the Samoyed breed standard says:

&gt;The bone is heavier than would be expected in a dog of this size but not so massive as to prevent the speed and agility most desirable in a Samoyed. In all builds, bone should be in proportion to body size. The Samoyed should never be so heavy as to appear clumsy nor so light as to appear racy. The weight should be in proportion to the height.

When the standard was written [this](http://allt-om-samojedhunden.712136.n3.nabble.com/file/n958269/5.jpg) is what was meant by that. Whereas now many breeders and judges take it as something like [this](http://samoyeds.lv/wp-content/gallery/amorelady/020.jpg). 

That is why I wanted a girl with bigger bone, she is still quite moderate compared to some of what you see and she has very long legs so she doesn't look bulky. I won't necessarily breed her to my boy but I will breed her to a moderate male because I want for my lines to be moderate when it comes to bone, perhaps won't be the most winning dogs but I think moderation is better for the breed because it is closer to how the breed looked when it was first imported from Siberia where it was selectively bred for hundreds of years - I'm sure they knew what they were doing! 

Sorry I can keep talking about Samoyeds for hours haha

&gt;But that'll be at least a decade from now, long after I finish university. My fiancee and I are also looking at getting a German Shepherd eventually -- but the breed isn't my forte, so I will have to study up on them too.

I love GSD's, they are definitely an interesting breed to learn about because their show lines look completely different from their working lines :)

That being said, Mega Manectric is a huge friggin' disappointment. End of story.
Mostly because there is probably next to zero chance of manectric getting a real evolution now. Megas are a waste of time imo and I pray to Arceus that they will be phased out in the next generation just like pokecontests were back in Gen III.

Before you all whip out your pitchforks at me, I'll say that on the competitive side M-Manectric is only useful with a ton of support but since simply having one on your team these days is basically telling the opponent ""hey, this ones my mega and its going to be running volt switch"" the predictability makes it easy to nerf."

While I don't think it's so simply a matter of bigotry tying these various groups together (including trp), regardless of cause, I've seen the actual intersectionality of these various groups not only over the web but IRL.

I know it's a point of confusion for a lot of the people here and in trp sometimes, *""wait, how could people actually believe this""*, and I used to wonder these things myself. Especially when a lot of these people were otherwise very agreeable and intelligent, IMHO. 

It makes me question a lot of my own knowledge, but assuming I am right and these people I know are the ignorant ones, I see it as they simply were too busy (their expertise and time was invested in business, tech, or something else) or just didn't bother to delve into their beliefs.

If you look at obvious examples, you have to look no further than Steve Jobs. The guy was obviously brilliant at a lot of things and hugely successful, but still made fatal decisions regarding his health and treatment that confused a lot of people. Smart, successful people can be wrong.

For demographic examples of successful reactionary groups (such as anarcho-capitalists specifically), I've checked the demographic surveys of bitcoin, because anarcho-capitalists were so common in bitcoin discussions I've been a part of online and offline.

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-03-10/demographics-bitcoin

Self-identified over 95% male and almost 40% anarcho-capitalist (which is still disproportionately high).

I actually know a couple bitcoin millionaires, one of whom showed me his bitcoin wallet to brag. The confidence and newfound wealth came with disdain for what he considered populist anti-success sentiment. I actually sympathize somewhat as I came from a populist background and have a good deal of distrust for it myself. But I also see it as just the wealth turning people into Smaug. It's just like Canadians I know personally who went from idolizing David Suzuki to turning into deniers of climate change because of the tar sands making their lives, businesses, families better off.

Why this mattered to me is that a lot of liberals I know in the USA/Canada have this impression that conservatives are a breed dying with age, and it's safe to disengage, ignore, mock, etc... when neo-reactionary converts are springing up all over around me all over, in the Bay Area of all places (and even I find myself sympathetic to many ideas being presented), and a lot of them are being driven into each other's ideas by what they perceive to be some conspiracy (whether that be deliberate conspiracy, per ""the Cathedral"" as mentioned in the article, or accidental conspiracy). And they're not just fedora-capped neckbeards who live in their mother's basement. They're reasonably intelligent and influential. That's what makes this worthy of consideration.

These nouveux riches startup founders/execs, bitcoin millionaires, digerati, immigrants (who actually did work pretty damned hard to climb the economic ladder), and so onâ¦ I see them slowly being pushed into other budding neo-reactionaries, e.g. some people who get a couple bad experiences like getting mugged in Oakland (like I actually have) or having businesses ruined by rioters, and suddenly became ""race realists""; or normal people who've recently became extra suspicious of the gov't due to the NSA ordeal and others. Otherwise normal, pleasant people who express that they feel like they've been pushed into a corner by a politically correct or intrusive culture. 

You see this in TRP with ethnic minorities knowingly and happily chatting and feeling relief talking with ""race realists"". Intersectionality indeed. Trained everyday to give less and less of a shit about political correctness or even things that matter to me."

1. A friend telling you Republicans and/or Democrats are stupid and you should be an Anarcho Capitalist?

2. A friend wanting to discuss (over a beer) a book he or she read by Robert P. Murphy talking about Austrian economics and how it relates to Anarcho Capitalism?

3. You being gifted said book by said friend at Christmas with the hope you would read it?

4. You coming across the book online or at a bookstore and you reading it?

This last one I don't think you would but I'm putting it down for full spectrum's sake...

5. You thinking about politics and you coming across the idea of Anarcho Capitalism with no outside stimulus?

Funny story: 

I met my boyfriend online. We chatted for a few weeks and then exchanged numbers and stuff. One day I was randomly in town (I lived about 2 hours away at the time) and I asked him to hang out out of the blue. He agreed to meet me at a local coffee house. I was SO nervous. Then he showed up and he was way hotter than he was in his pictures and I got even more nervous. So now I'm trying to be cool and funny and not  look like an idiot. We both order this drink called ""Red Stuff"" yum, anyways. About an half an hour into our date, while telling a very enthusiastic rendition of something that happened to me, I spill my drink all over both of us  I'm embarrassed. He laughs it off and says it's OK. Got the waiter to come clean up and got me a new drink. 

So after that the date is going well and another hour or so later I spill my drink all over both of us AGAIN. At this point it's hilarious and we can't stop laughing. The poor waiter half-joked that he was cutting me off and didn't bring me a new drink that time. I was so mortified and I thought for sure this guy was never going to call me again and would think I was crazy. But apparently I was charming and endearing to him because we have been together for coming on 3 years and we are inseparable. I can't wait to tell our grand-kids how smooth I was.

TL;DR If you spill something on him, he will stay. "

So far I've talked to the most interesting people. Long conversations about music, hours spent sharing favorite classical music pieces, life advice, ect. I've never had a bad experience honestly. Sure there's lots of ASL crap but once you get past that, there are TONS of people worth talking to. Never done the camera aspect of it because that's just searching for trouble; not to mention, it's geared towards flirting and sending nudes which isn't happening.

It's where I met both of my wonderful penpals! For over a year I was writing letters (snail mail) to my penpal over in Bangladesh. I learned about his Muslim holiday traditions about killing cattle in the street, he took pictures for me so I could see his city and the people, and answered a million questions I had about Bengali society. He volunteers at the local children's school, one day he got his classroom to take a group photo together and included letters they wrote in English. He has  the funniest stories about the food (and shitting), about his bosses, about his friendsâ¦No one has such a dry, dark, and realistic personality as him which meshes well with me. 

My second penpal was different. He was from the U.S. and had such an affinity for music. He introduced me to indie-folk and all the bands I currently love. Every week we sent each other a song. We talked about every day stuff (work, cooking dinner, where we've traveled, movies we want to see). 

My first experience with Omegle:  right off the bat, the first person I talked to was incredible. We spent over an hour and half talking about his life. He lived in rural North Carolina and had one daughter. He loved his wife but she cheated on him so he filed for divorce. Afterwards, he consumed himself in his work. He was an auto mechanic if I remember correctly. We shared classical music. I was introduced to Chopin, Nocturne in E-flat Major opus 9 no.2 (piano solo). It was so beautiful. I listened to it every day for weeks. 

Second awesome encounter: We role played hannibal lecter and sherlock holmes. Started off with ""Hello, Clarice"" and we added to the story line basically.

Third awesome encounter: for over an hour, I shared music with a young girl who lived just outside London. She said I was ""lovely."" That it was the best experience she had on Omegle. She talked to me about One Direction (I never heard of them at the time) and she gushed about her friends. Her life and such. 

So many awesome people but you have to break the barrier and be patient. "

I think you've got a pretty big issue right here.  First off, most men don't do that.  The majority of men do not sexually assault, harass, are not misogynistic, or impose ridiculous beauty standards.  However, assuming that all these things are done to women is a valid reason for women to not love men, the inverse would be true as well.  Women can, and some women do, sexually assault, harass, commit sexists acts (not sure if there is a specific word used for female on male sexism), and hold men to impossible beauty standards.  That some women do does not mean that all, or even most women do.  Nor does it validate the view that men should not love women on it's own.  

&gt;On top of that, I don't believe heterosexual women are naturally as attracted to men as heterosexual men are to women.   

What you personally believe doesnt really speak for the rest of the population.  There may be many women who consider themselves to be asexual or something similar, and feel no real attraction towards men.  However, that does not automatically mean that all women do not and clearly some women do, as some women find men very attractive and actively pursue them.

it's not going to fix your emotional scarring, it's not going to change him into a better person, it's not going to result in anything positive at all.

beyond that: half the reason bullies do the bullying is because of problems of their own... maybe they've been bullied or even abused by parents, etc...  it doesn't give them an excuse or justify what they did to you - but you probably have more in common with your bullies than you think."

FlightsFancy,todayilearned,1390549936.0,"That's not really true. The treatment meted out by the French and later the English had nothing to do with European colonial policy re: treatment of indigenous peoples. It was largely a side-effect of corporate policy. The fur trade (esp. in beaver pelts) and fishing were the dominant industries in early Canada, and both French and English traders required the assistance of indigenous peoples (initially, mostly members of one of the Six Nations tribes, then later the MÃ©tis and the Inuit) to set up trap and supply lines, navigate in the unfamiliar and hostile landscape, and to provide enough manpower to run the fur-trade industry.

The typical model from the early 1600s to the mid-1700s involved French fur trappers (*des Canadiens*) running individual trap lines in vast sections of territory with assistance/cooperation/support from indigenous peoples. Trap lines were relocated when the animal population was depleted or when the seasons changed, and so the French traders were seasonal nomads with long circuitous routes that usually led them from Montreal or Quebec City into the wilderness, and back again. As a result, the French trappers were much more dependent on their indigenous allies, but only as far as the relationship proved profitable.#  When the interests of the natives clashed with those of the French trappers, they were murdered (often by poisoned whiskey), burned out, driven off their territory, or deliberately infected with viruses via the trade of ""plague blankets.""

(#It's worth pointing out, some of the French trappers married into or joined the indigenous populations, their offspring eventually forming the MÃ©tis ethnic group, which were ultimately considered ""Indian"" despite their French heritage, and were not accepted by Quebecois society.)

The British fur trade model didn't rely on individual European trappers and traders to collect furs; they set up forts in remote locations and ""paid""'indigenous people to bring in the skins and pelts for them. This created an extensive network of trading forts (later solidified into the Hudson's Bay Fur Trade Company, aka The Bay, aka North America's oldest company) and led to competition with the French trappers (who later adopted the same model, manifest as the North West Company).

All of this illustrates that the French and British merely employed different models when they went about the fur trade process. Neither treated the indigenous people ""better"" - they were still viewed as a resource, much like the animal pelts themselves, and therefore seen as exploitable and, ultimately, expendable. When completion between the two major fur trading companies heated up, and over-trapping and changing fashion trends in Europe led to a massive decrease in the beaver population (making the pelts rarer and, yup, more valuable) indigenous people were seen as competition rather than allies in the race to collect an increasingly limited resource. This led to direct conflicts over trap lines and profit shares; the resulting violence between European trading empires put indigenous people in the crossfire.

With the collapse of the fur trade and the call for the establishment of permanent white settlement coast-to-coast prior to Confederation, Canadian policy towards its indigenous peoples moved firmly from economically-motivated tolerance/partnership to that of genocide. The establishment of the western reserve system, the legacy of resettlement and the numerous broken treaties, and the culture of disenfranchisement enshrined in the 1864 Indian Act, all conspired to bring about a crisis point that echoed the rapid American genocide of its native peoples, but progressed at a much slower rate. Both French and English Canada were complicit with this later phase of race-relations.

**TL;DR**:  The indigenous people of this country did not fare better with ""the French,"" they were exploited and ultimately disenfranchised by both the French and English when they were no longer considered to be ""useful"" as a resource to exploit.

My mother is ill and what turned into a trip to a doctors appointment turned into her getting admitted to the hospital.

Well, there are ""nourishment"" rooms where nurses will keep food for patients and almost always packed to the gills with ginger ale, prune juice, and protein shakes. 

So, I'm familiar with the routine to get my mother settled: Unpack her clothes, get her tucked into bed, and get her a gigantic cup of ginger ale. So I do A and B and then go to get her soda. 

So, I'm minding my own business, getting mom's soda and soon I hear frantic shuffling followed by ""Mrs. Derpstein! NO!""

Not to say they weren't treated badly, but the Krypteia probably didn't happen the way most people think it did, as its only source of it being used to hunt helots is from Plutarch (who already had problematic sources on Sparta, since he wrote well past its decline). It wouldn't make economic sense for them to go around murdering helots. Plato's account (the first mention of Krypteia) makes it sound like a form of training where they go out into the wilderness to learn survival. Just another harsh day for the Spartan youth. "

Drakkanrider,sex,1390550162.0,"The best advice I can give is to get comfortable being naked with each other in a non-sexual context.  I was in a similar boat myself not two years ago.  Dicks can be terrifying, mysterious, disgusting, intimidating, etc. to a girl who has not had any experience with one.  And it's hard to de-mystify it in a sexual setting.  For me, I was able to become comfortable with penises when my current bf let me play with his after sex.  When it's lying there, flaccid, and you can just flop it around and play with it, it doesn't look so scary.  Walk around naked around her, let her get a good view of it when it isn't hard and when neither one of you is planning on doing anything sexual to it.  Encourage her to play with it, show her how you can stretch it, wave it around.  Make it a toy to play with and something fun to enjoy together.  She might blush, or giggle, or whatever, take it in stride.  The more normal and everyday you make it, the more comfortable she will be with it and the more she will be able to relax and do things with it.  If her only experience with your dick is when it comes out of your pants at full-mast ready to be shoved inside her vagina, well, she isn't going to be able to develop an intimate relationship with it."

jednorazowa,AskReddit,1390550171.0,"Being spanked taught me that if someone does something that makes you unhappy, you hit them.  Seemed reasonable to my child-self's mind.  So I hit people who made me unhappy. But then I got in trouble for hitting people who made me unhappy.

From this I learned that my parents are great big hypocrites (although I didn't know that word then) and that their punishments were intrinsically unjust. Because of this, it never once occurred to me that there might be a good reason for any rules they made.

The second problem is not just that spanking is hitting, it's that spanking is hitting on the bum.  The bum is a private part.  And people aren't supposed to touch your private parts.  This was a very, very important point, and we had a whole book about it called ""It's my Body and I Say No!""  So after we first got that book, the next time I was spanked I sad ""It's my body and I say NO!""  And then I got in trouble for using that line on my parents.

From this I concluded that the rules my parents tell me aren't the real rules, and there's a secret, other set of rules that I don't know but have to guess.  (This is a feeling that has hindered me for years - even into adulthood if someone tells me the way things are supposed to be done, my gut instinct is they must not really mean it.)

But, more importantly, I also concluded that my parents either enjoy humiliating me by inflicting pain on my private parts, or enjoy seeing me humiliated by having violence inflicted on my private parts. Because why else would they be doing it? So if at any point in my life someone else had touched my private parts in a way that I found humiliating and/or painful, I would never have even considered telling my parents, on the assumption that they'd just punish me more for doing something to bring that upon myself. The thought never even crossed my mind that they might protect me or might have my best interests in mind."

keatonch,askscience,1390550255.0,"You can also make your own. I work as a sales rep in the spirits department at a massive liquor store in my hometown and it's my job to come up with cool ideas for people to try out. You can take a wooden block that fits inside of the neck of a bottle and char it according to this temperature chart [here](http://bikeforbeer.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/toast-oak-wood-1.2-800X800.jpg)  in your oven at home! (Keeping in mind that this is for oak) Once it's out of the oven you can either season it in some sherry or bourbon for as long as you please and then add it to a bottle of alcohol to be aged. 

You can also make your own spiced rums and there are tons of recipes online for it like [this!](http://liquor.com/articles/spice-your-rum/) Keeping in mind that you can also create your own concotions and you don't have to put in everything it tells you to! Also: crappy rum in, crappy rum out. Same goes for everything so if you wouldn't drink it normally don't try and improve it by spicing it or aging it on oak. 

Also there are private 2L casks that you can buy online for around $70 or so. Keep in mind that you need the cask to breathe to get the most authentic aging out of it. Also, because of the increased surface area to volume ratio it will age a HELL of a lot faster in a private keg. So don't forget to check up on it! There is such a thing as too much oak!

TheHolyFool,AskWomen,1390550258.0,"I'm pretty sure the first compliment I ever got from anyone was ""you're such a sweetheart!"" And thus, it remained one of the only compliments consistently given to me throughout my childhood and teenage years. 

Why did I keep getting these compliments? Because I kept being a ""sweetheart."" Whatever you reward a kid for, especially in a positive manner, the kid's gonna keep doing it. So I figured out what ""being a sweetheart"" entailed, and I kept doing it.

Then, when I'd have a moment of not ""being a sweetheart,"" my family and friends would act so fucking *shocked*, as if a big bad meanie jerk bully had possessed my innocent sweetheart body -- they made it seem like I wasn't even *capable* of being mean, angry, or accusatory. So when I was visibly not ""being a sweetheart,"" I was immediately greeted with horror and disappointment from the people who I looked up to the most. Horrible feeling, that one...so I tended not to invoke it.

Now, when I figured out how to separate my life from pleasing those people (or when I began to see ""disturbing the universe"" as an option) was when I really became aware of how sweetly socialized I was, and just how much it had shaped my life up to that point. For many many years, I would become extremely upset, inconsolable even, at the mere suggestion that I'd done something to hurt another human being, even if it wasn't intentional -- even if someone was just fucking with me. The way it looks from where I stand now is kind of upsetting -- that being brought up like that almost necessitates habitual low self-esteem, because you eventually realize that *everything* a person does has the capacity to hurt someone or something, and sometimes you'll never be aware of it. Thought process: Do I dare disturb the universe? No, that's for others to do; I am ""the sweetheart;"" I am not capable of stirring the pot by my own suggestion, even if it's at a goddamn soup kitchen, lest I serve a homeless woman the chicken bone that chokes her to death. I am here to prove that truly nice, harmless people exist in the world, even if those I'm proving it to would rather me contribute earth-shaking ideas to society. 

It just wasn't my department in my mind, nor was it my responsibility, for a long time. That changed when my high school Psychology teacher wrote a particularly genius question on the chalkboard one day as class started. Generally, her class started with a stream-of-consciousness-style writing exercise spurred by something she'd write on the board. But that day, she specifically told us she didn't want us to answer it, and she didn't give us any other instructions before she returned to her desk to grade papers for another 20 minutes. 

Nowadays, I don't think anyone who knows me would call me a sweetheart unless it was suggested. But they sure as hell applaud everything I've done to disturb the universe. I'm a journalist, and frequently I run into people of all genders, races, and creeds who've been conditioned into that sweet, impotent silence. If I am capable of understanding their circumstances, most of the time I feel confident enough to point at their undisturbed universes and, off-the-record, ask them what my high school Psychology teacher asked us so long ago: 

""Should things be the way they are?"" 

If you're raised to fear stirring the pot, that question is a paradox -- if you answer ""yes,"" you're assuming a lot of things about a world you've always been too afraid to interact with, so you're probably unqualified to answer at all. If you answer ""no,"" you're also admitting that harm is being done and you're not doing anything to stop it -- and if you're lucky, the question will turn into a sneaky and persistent call-to-action, and might just force you to disturb the damn universe for the rest of your life.

Well, I've certainly had some coffee this evening.

In the event that you are assisting someone with a birth, if there is someone on the way to help (eg: paramedics) do not cut the cord unless it is wrapped around the baby. Wrap the baby in a blanket with the cord away from its face, and when the placenta is born keep it attached, try and put it in a bowl or bag or wrap it up too as the Paramedics will want to check to make sure the placenta is whole.

Cutting the cord without sterile instruments can sometimes cause infection.

[a good read](http://www.babycenter.com.au/a557710/emergency-home-birth) for anyone who wants to be prepared in case they need to assist with an emergency birth.

In cases of premature birth, you can attempt to initiate CPR on the infant, however it can be hard for a mother to watch this, you can cause more damage to the infant if you are not properly trained, and more often then not your energy can be better spent keeping the mother comfortable and calm than trying to resuscitate a baby that is already lost."

KH10304,Advice,1390550391.0,"I once gave a distraught well dressed old man who was hitchhiking on the 85 on ramp 100$ and a ride to the airport so he could avoid losing his job as a top navy surgeon. He had an involved sob story about how his 14 year old daughter had been kidnapped/ran away with a carny and then she told him to come save her and so he left base without leave to pick her up in my town. Supposedly she then took all his money at the motel they were in and ran with the carny. He was very convincing, with surgical details and details of his long expensive search for her. What tips me the most towards him being a con man though is that he tried to appeal to my greed, saying he'd give me back 1000 for the 100. I told him I'd appreciate the 100 back only, and took him to the airport and wished him well.

I think I was conned, certain details didn't add up when I googled them later (especially the idea he fed me that an enlisted surgeon can get a 100 dollar flight with the army anywhere, something about volunteering as a flight doctor or something, I found no evidence of it online) that said, I kind of came away with it feeling the same way you do though, if there's a chance it was real, how am I gonna live with myself thinking I didn't help this guy to the best of my ability not lose his pension and livelihood because of his daughter's mistakes?

I hope you weren't conned, that said, it certainly sounds like you were. Honestly though, I think if you can afford whatever problems this causes then be glad you're a good person, and just pity her for being someone who exploits the generosity and good will of others. 

Plus who knows, 5% chance she rolls back home friday and you two live fuckily ever after.

Edit: All the same I do kinda think about that asshole everytime I wish I had 100$, which is annoying and makes me want to avoid being scammed ever again.

keyo_,sex,1390550511.0,"&gt; she wants to wait until marriage.

Well this part is more weird than the dildo. I can see why someone would want the dildo, because it's slow and she is in control and won't get hurt.

I think it shows she is either crazy religious or does not trust you. Either way it seems like a red flag to me. It's good that she doesn't want to rush into marriage, but seriously sex before marriage is a very good idea. But good luck changing her mind on that one. If you've been in the relationship for 2 years you've already shown you're a chump.

You should also ""try"" her out before getting married. The fleshlight comment is a valid point, it makes me laugh. Good sex takes effort and skill from both participants.

Just out of curiosity do you do any sexual activities? Oral, fingering/handjobs, anal? 

I think the dildo might be a gateway to more pleasure. But it's definitely weird."
IngwazK,fatpeoplestories,1390550515.0,"There are still some issues that women legitimately face.  The problem is that since many of the major and severe problems have since been solved to a significant degree, that some feminists have become radical feminists who say things like ""all men are rapists"" (seriously, look up schrodinger's rapist.  it's beyond absurd.)  

Of course, these radical feminists are a minority, but they're a very loud and annoying minority and with the way our society has been leaning lately, if you say anything that offends someone and they gripe about it, you're generally expected to apologize.   This ignores that the fact that you're offended by something means very little.  

But seriously, women are still not truely equal with men, and I say that as a man.  Men have some issues as well of course, and those deserve serious consideration too.  but unfortunately you get people like this, who think free bleeding is somehow empowering and that the patriarchy is responsible for all there problems and that men all go to secret patriarchy club meetings where we have beer and sexually abuse (read: find attractive and flirt with) proud womyn."

You can try riding into the grind from on top of the curb, and then pop out of it while you still have speed, either back onto the curb or down below.

Then try ollies into 50-50s on the curb, and then move onto 5-0s, nose grinds, and other variations.  

Also, backside boardslides are pretty easy to do as well.  You can easily ride up and slap your board over a waxed parking block without having to really ollie into it, to get the feel for a boardslide, and then find a ledge you can ollie onto and boardslide.

The course was an entire year long which was very strange for a High school course so when I took Drafting 1 as a freshman I had no idea what I was getting in to. Because so few students made it to D4 he just had those students set at a row of [tables](http://www.draftingfurniture.com/mayline/ranger.jpg) on one side of the room and the other 80% of tables for D1 students.

He would teach the lesson and explain the things and then just monitor. He made the D4 students teach most of the D1's everything beyond drawing techniques. By the time you were in D3 you were in charge of yourself. He would tell you what was expected of you by the end of the year and that was that. If you had any questions feel free but there would be no lesson.

In no other class I would expect this to work but you just *needed* to not disappoint him. In D4 you only two project/assignments the entire year, you needed to build a [9-Cylinder Radial Aircraft Engine](http://www.tjdmodels.com/images/products/4dc3d25861f29-msao.jpg) piece by piece in [inventor](http://www.solidsmack.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/InventorPublisher_TechPreview.png) and assemble it and if a single piece was off it wouldn't work.

The other was you needed to take the Professional Grade ADDA Licensing exam and pass. He had a 95% pass rate so when I was 17 in 2008 I got my professional grade mechanical drafting license.

This was a very ""O Captain! My captain!"" time in my life. Everyone one of the D4 Students I graduated with are friends still to this day despite how far we are from our high school. Like no one else in my life, even my parents, I try and do him proud.

keatonch,Damnthatsinteresting,1390550921.0,"You're seeing a bottle full of steam that is then placed into a glass of cool water. 

As soon as the tip of the bottle enters the water, the gas liquid interface of steam to water begins to cool the steam inside of the bottle. 

Because of [Charle's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles%27s_law) stating that volume is directly proportionate to temperature, we can infer that because the gas is cooling it will try to lower in volume. 

Because the inside of the bottle stays a constant and we know that there in an inverse relationship between pressure and volume, we now know that the pressure inside of the bottle becomes reduced as a result. Because there is ambient air pressure (around 100 kpa) it begins to act on the fluid inside of the bottle pushing it up into it. 

As the water goes into the bottle it cools off more and more of the steam inside of the bottle further expediting the process making the transition from gas to liquid happen faster and faster. 

Once it passes the neck of the bottle you'll notice that it increases **dramatically**. This is because a much larger portion of gas (steam) is being cooled into a liquid (water.)


Thus the pressure reduces much faster and the liquid intrudes at an accelerated rate. If this were a coke can or a rail car it would implode from the force.

Fun fact: 1 mL of water can make almost 1.812L of gas."

Its interesting that you say this. I do think you're right, people are starting to realize that you can't change someones beliefs in the course of an anonymous, heated argument. That's good.

But what I think is important is the expectation you say: ""affect someones personal beliefs"". A lot of people, when having discussions on *anything* they feel strongly about, whether its religion, politics, or otherwise, will try to change the other person. A lot of people in Reddit's average age group have finally realized you can't do that. So they've given up on even trying to talk. 

What we need to start realizing is that there are other things to be drawn from that sort of conversation. Don't try to change the other person and don't try to change. That shouldn't be the end goal. The goal should simply be to learn about the other person by learning what they feel passionate about, and vice versa.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390551438.0,"Good on you for recognizing that some situations call for empathetic listening rather than our usual impulse to offer solutions. 

Everyone has a different idea of what empathy means, but I think two concepts are useful here: understanding and presence. When she talks or vents to you about a problem, she primarily just wants you to *understand* how she feels, not try to change it. And here is the key: **understanding is a *process*, not a state.** It's not that you do or your don't. There isn't really an end point because obviously you aren't her. The best listeners are those who know they don't fully understand but keep striving to. If it's something that's weighing on her a lot, it comes off like you don't really understand if you seem too quick to think or say you understand. It's more important that you listen patiently and **ask questions that dig deeper into *her* experience.** Ask her about how she felt, what she was thinking, etc. 

Saying you think you understand because of x,y,z you have experienced makes it feel like you're turning the conversation toward yourself, even though that's not your intent. So even though it seems counterintuitive, **don't think of empathy as *relating* to her.** Trying to relate leads you to translate her experiences by comparing them to your own. It not only shifts the focus onto you, but it risks boiling her experiences down to a simplified form. Sure, it can be helpful to note the similarities between what you or other people you know have experienced and what she experienced. Just think of that as one lens, not the whole picture. There's probably a lot more to the experience than the part you can relate to.

So then how do you understand and empathize with someone without thinking too much about relating to them? **Think of empathy as the condition of being present with someone in their feelings.** Your goal is to connect with her in this moment. What she is feeling may not be what you would feel in the same situation, but shed those judgements. Most people can't do this because the urge to be the strong/stoic/rational one is ingrained in us. We think of reaching out to people as saying  the right thing to comfort them. In my opinion the best way to reach out to someone is to bare your own heart to them. Just simply walk alongside them, metaphorically speaking, to experience what they feel. Cry when they cry. The only way to bring down someone else's walls is to bring down your own.

Resist the logic of thinking ""well if I were in her shoes, I would feel x,y,z"". See how that turns the emphasis on the experience, not the feeling, as the important piece of the puzzle? The experience can't be the starting point for you to understand her because you weren't there to experience it. On the other hand, you can bear witness to how she feels about the experience. That should be your starting point, because that is what you can most fully understand. 

I know lots of people would disagree with my idea of empathy, but I find this approach useful.

They generally showed a little bit more overall situational awareness, and gave a little more attention to Soldier care...but where some former NCOs go wrong is still acting like an NCO when they aren't.  That's something that I've witnessed.  The micromanaging ""techniques"" that they used as NCOs to ensure that work was ""getting done"" never left them.  So instead of letting the actual NCOs do that, they bear down on everyone and slowing progress of taskings, nitpicking things that don't necessarily have any bearing.

Experience often begets better quality leadership, but if an NCO was a shitty NCO, then they won't make a much better officer.

FlightsFancy,todayilearned,1390551567.0,"""They"" is pretty inaccurate - the majority of aboriginals in Canada do not receive any benefits or tax-exempt status. 

To qualify for ""Indian status"" you must belong to a band, tribe or nation listed within the 1864 Indian act, which constitutes a list of all treaty-nations. Your heritage is determined by your father's line of descent, which is impossible for many First Nations to track, as most surviving tribes historically traced someone's lineage through their mother's line, not their father's. And if an Indian woman married a white man (prior to 1972) she and all of her future children were stripped of their status. 

Also, few written records of band member names were kept, as oral history (completely disrupted by the residential school system) was the record-keeping method of choice. You can imagine how few living aboriginals can satisfy the conditions set out for legal status, between biracial marriages, the disruption caused by generations of residential schooling, simple bureaucratic incompetence, and deliberate attempts made by various provincial and federal authorities to strike as many names from the 1864 list as possible.

Furthermore, Inuit and Metis people do not qualify for status, as these groups never signed any official treaties with the Canadian, British, or French governments.

Indigenous Canadians account for roughly 10% of the population. Only ~2% qualify for full status, and it's almost impossible for a person to establish that they should receive status but don't. 

I've never understood the white fixation on status: it's always cited as an example of how ""Indians have it so great in Canada."" Only a fraction of an *extremely* small population has it! And believe me, being white in Canada will get you much, much further ahead than being ""Indian"" (or, God, ""Eskimo,"" like me) than a little 'S' in your wallet ever could."

It is also fun to spend time with the elite athletes/coaches.

The camp or ""running vacation"" is whatever you make of it.  There are always scheduled talks and events going on, but if you don't feel like attending, or wish to do something else, (like explore the surrounding area) you are free to do so.

Campers arrive at all different running abilities, so I wouldn't be worried about being too slow.  Yes, there are some campers who are very fast, but the vast majority are average runners.  I have seen many 5 hour marathoners attend the camp and see many of them return in subsequent years.

I would recommend trying one out!  I can only speak for ZAP, but I have always found everyone extremely friendly and welcoming.  (I always leave with several new friends whom I meet up with at races and end up seeing back at ZAP years later.)  Most importantly, I always leave the camps feeling inspired and the camp is consistently one of my favorite weeks of the year.

meanttolive,explainlikeimfive,1390551621.0,"Your experience captures the inherent problem with any fetish: it makes it hard to lead a normal sex life since arousal is identified with the fetish.

Another IIRC answer, but it may be reversible with dedicated effort over time. To reverse a fetish, this is what I think would need to happen:

1. **Planning**- what is the long term goal? To lead a normal sex life. What are the short term goals that will get you there? Realizing when the attraction is occurring, and making a plan on how to stop/redirect the attraction.
2. **Awareness**- realize when the fetish is present &amp; when you are becoming aroused. The same way that you currently connect ""feet""=""attraction"", you should also practice realizing that this is happening (""feet""=""attraction""=""consciousness""). 
3. **Change**- you realize that the attraction is happening, and you've previously decided that you're either going to nip it in the bud (maybe by flexing some muscles to redirect blood flow, getting up and going outside for a walk, taking a cold shower) or allow yourself to feel the attraction while consciously redirecting it (maybe by focusing on a mental image of a girl's ankles, then moving to her legs, then ass, then torso and breasts, etc). 

This would take time and conscious effort from your end, which can definitely be difficult. And remember I could be 100% wrong, but I imagine that the same way a fetish can develop over time, we can reverse it over time with conscious effort. I hope this helps.

Keep in mind that most of that $84,000 a person is used in research and development. It's kind of how most retailers operate in the red during most of the calendar year--but during the holidays they make so much money that all those month in deficit are worth it. It costs so much to conduct research and design a new drug, but the basic production costs are so cheap. The reason they charge so much is mostly because they need to get back what they invested in the first place (plus some to make their stockholders happy)."

Some force users were inept at using the force a certain way, Vader couldn't use lightning without killing himself, some EU force users weren't very good at manipulation while others were skilled enough to manipulate atmosphere and individual molecules, etc. I can't recall anything outside of games classifying force attacks-- and it makes sense.

They've also done worse or similar stuff to what hunter moore did, especially with young women and naked pictures. The same has happened on reddit before. A woman posts to gonewild, later posts to /r/pics something trivial but it hits the front page and someone mentions a gonewild post. Then someone finds her facebook, twitter, instagram, and sends the nude pictures to her old high school and family. Even the founder of reddit, when confronted with issues like this, absolved himself of responsibility of properly managing the community or anything the community did and instead said it was the fault of the girls or the parents of the girl. Instead of properly addressing the issues at that time of people sharing sexualized images of teenagers, most likely stolen or hacked, he blamed Anderson Cooper and his guests taking issue with this for 'not knowing how reddit really worked'.

Anonymous and reddit can do amazing things, and also do some horribly despicable things, Hunter Moore took it a step further and tried to make money off of it and used preexisting images of doxxing, basically an assembled image full of screenshots of a persons facebook or other personal information with their nudes that anonymous had been doing for years.

This culture of misogyny on the internet doesn't bode well for anyone. It negatively impacts the life of women, telling them they shouldn't express their sexuality online out of fear or shame and if they do then they should expect or deserve any negativity that comes along with it, while at the same time basically saying as a woman on the internet you don't exist other than to be nude of camera. It also negatively impacts the life of young men, when they see stuff like this happen and no moral compass around them telling them it's wrong, they start to see it as cool and may use the same manipulation on girls at school or in their own life. Not having any tangible responsibility for acting like this, or excusing it and putting the blame onto women, is the newest version of the 'boys will be boys' club that removes any blame from the men doing this and solely puts it on women for expressing themselves. It negatively affects how they view women, how they view women's sexuality, and how they view their relationship with women in the world. If you reduce someone down only to their sexuality, or what they have to offer you, there is no room for empathy."

I'm 26 and I've never been much of a drinker, so that isn't really a problem for me, but sometimes I do crave something other than water. Especially when I'm around others that are drinking. I like the flavored syrups that a lot of coffee places use. I add it to lemonade - turn it into strawberry lemonade, or raspberry lemonade. Or tea - make peach tea or passion fruit tea. Or add caramel to coffee. 

My blood results never really improved, because the damage is done, so I don't have much to offer in that respect, but I do think it's important that you work closely with your doctor. There are lots of meds that are hard on the liver and having a doctor keep an eye out for that sort of thing is important. 

I know you're scared, and I've been sick with lupus for six years, and I still get scared when something new pops up, or things get worse, but there really is a silver lining. For me, it's that I now relate to people in a whole new way. I always wanted to be a nurse, I'm truly happiest when I'm helping others. I had to quit college because of my lupus, but I still get to take care of people and help them via my own experiences. And I've learned to appreciate the little things a lot more. And the best news of all is that you've found this and now you can treat it. 

I'm so glad you've found out and you're on your way to protecting your liver. I know our situations are pretty different, but feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

If you are asking on this subreddit, is highly likely you already believe the issue is related to fibromyalgia, and I think when most people post it's not because they want to find a connection, but because they want to talk about the issue in relation to fibro.

I could post on a general health sub ""does anyone else have bad vision"" I am likely to be met with a range of answers from to ""yes, turns out its cancer"" to ""No, you should see a doctor, might be cancer""  Those sorts of dialogues aren't very usefull to most of us, we see doctors on a regular basis and the number of tests and scans we have we know its nothing really bad, we just want to know if its fibro, or if its something separate, and if it is fibro, what have other found to help. 

I see a lot of posts that start with ""DEA [symptom]?"" but when you read the main post you see that this person has already seen a doctor who has confirmed its fibro-related and they have started trying a few things and they just want to touch base and say high and get to know the community using the common symptom as a way to connect. in which case, the title could read ""if you have it: Lets discuss [symptom]"""

If she's a close friend, you shouldn't even have to remind her that things like this stay between you and her. It's **your** business and not hers. Simply put, your friend M is the source of all these issues here and she seems to deserve being told off about all this.

EDIT: Sorry, forgot to actually answer your question. My advice to you is to explain the situation to your guy. If he hasn't already found out that these delicate matters have become known in your group of friends, he probably will soon. I know you said you'd rather not talk to him, but you may be making a crucial mistake if you don't. If you like this guy the way you say, you will also respect his need to be informed. Don't hold back information from him on the pretense that it might hurt him - *it's not up to you to decide what will and will not hurt his feelings, the only right thing is that you be truthful to him*.

If he's a chill guy he'll probably not care so much. Otherwise you'll just have to apologize, show that you want things to work out with him, and hope for the best. Then, you should talk to your friend M. Maybe you can get her to apologize to the guy, even. Best of luck to you."

earthboundEclectic,worldnews,1390553135.0,"Wow, you are condescending. Please grace us with your wisdom oh knowledgeable one. How else has humanity erred?

Doesn't feel good does it? Meanwhile, as a simple standardized barter commodity, money is entirely the wrong candidate for ""the single most stupid and evil act in known human history (TSMSAEAIKHH)."" Try greed, or perhaps apathy. It's not the money itself, but how it is used. Heck, even capitalism is a better candidate for TSMSAEAIKHH that money itself.

I used to think this way, too...when I was about five. Because I was five, I naturally assumed I'd become president, so I decided that when I did, I'd burn all the money so that nobody would be poor. It's a pretty juvenile thought process. 

Let's assume that tomorrow, suddenly all the money in the world was gone. All the cash, bonds, stocks, etc has disappeared, and every electronic bank account reads $0.00. Now what? Well we pretty much have two options: revert to a barter system or share everything and volunteer to do our jobs. As a kid, I assumed the latter. But of course, in reality it would mean that nothing would get done. People would have no reason to work shitty jobs--your sewer system and your local McDonalds cannot run on altruism.

Meanwhile, there is a reason why we replaced the barter system with a monetary system--or rather, we augmented it. Money created a standard  by which all business could be done. How are you going to buy food if your job pays in rugs, and the grocers do not need rugs? It's a mess, and money provided an easy-exchange medium."

Once the baby is out, if you rest the baby on the mothers chest you can lay the cord out along the mothers stomach as you wait for the placenta. any risk of strangulation at this point is almost nil. 

You should wait for the placenta to be born before cutting the cord if you are not medically trained. While the placenta is still attached to the uterine wall blood is still being circulated through the placenta to the baby, you can see the cord 'pulsing' in time with the babies heart beat. Cutting at this stage can can lead to infantile anaemia. If you are medically trained you will know how to avoid this safely, but if not, wait for the entire baby and placenta to be born, wait for the cord to stop beating, then cut it. the way nature intended. There is no reason at all to cut the cord before the placenta is born.

Maybe the rapist is a friend and it disrupts the social circle if the victim were to call attention to it, or maybe he doesn't want to believe she's a bad person and trivializes it, or maybe he recognizes the very real fact that people who are raped are doubted by others (it's even happening in this thread, jfc). 

Think of what he has to gain by telling others he was raped, and how much more he has to lose. The costs of not telling can outweigh the benefits of telling. 

Personally, I would ask if he wants to press charges. If she had no issue violating him several times, who's to say she hasn't done it before to someone else or won't do it again? At the same time, this is not your battle. 

Ask him what he wants to do about it but make it clear that he should disengage from her. No answering any calls, texts, emails, etc. Sidestep the situation if he runs into her- he can say ""I don't want to talk to you"" or ""I can't talk right now"" and leave the area. He should take caution to be with others when in public as a way to discourage her from approaching him. 

Rape is very real. Male rape is real. Many victims are discouraged from coming forward. He doesn't have to press charges, but he doesn't have to be around her either. "

This sounds like bullshit to me, or he's got massive baggage. More than likely, he's setting up a precedence where he's in control. If he doesn't know if he could trust you 3 weeks in, then he has no business stringing you along, or he's too slow. Either way, it sounds like you're already sacrificing too much for him, and feeling guilty for breaking his trust, which are two signs of a controlling relationship.

I think there are similar facilities in the East, but can't be 100%.

The club is usually extremely helpful in circumstances like these. This season they have significantly upped the number of staff outside and around the approach areas to the gates, to assist with directions and any difficulties. I regularly see people who need extra assistance being walked to or taken in via separate entrances rather than the turnstiles.

banana-tree,Turkey,1390554618.0,"&gt;He was explaining himself. He wasn't trying to convince you.

No, he was saying (and I was referring to) stuff like ""so you've provided even more evidence that the idea of Armenian genocide is ludicrous."".

&gt;Afaik his claims are sourced. If you believe otherwise ask him for his sources for a particular claim or give a counter source.

The sources he gave in the original comment were all from wiki. I'm not a historian and can't bring up every relevant source in a reasonable time for a reddit comment. I have listened to lectures where academicians have provided sources that contradict him though. [I'll link to one just off the top of my head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6_InAhUmmM) if you're interested. As a layperson, academic consensus against him isn't irrelevant for me. That's why my initial comment was asking him to argue this in a relevant subreddit like askhistorians where we could read more informed people go against his arguments.

&gt; it seems like you two are on the same page

His point was that the Ottomans did the best they could to prevent deaths and even helped the Armenians financially, and that it was a temporary solution to prevent riots. I don't agree with any of that, and think it was intended as a permanent solution. The only part we agree is that the word genocide doesn't fit what happened. There is a lot to debate on the political part as well, the reason why I didn't go into that was because I was actively trying to avoid that discussion for the reasons I cited above.

The part we disagree about the human aspect is that I think he's flaming the debate by calling every claim of ""genocide"" Anti-Turkish, and I think that sentiment provokes nationalistic reactions. That's what pushed me to comment. He's just replied again with ridiculous nationalistic generalizations, and that's the exact thing that initially disturbed me, still does, and will continue to do. It's sweet of you to want us to agree, but that's not going to happen."

Why is it that dog is man's best friend?  It's certainly not because a dog can understand what we are thinking or what we experienced. They can often sense what we feel, but they surely cannot understood where those feelings come from. Despite (or maybe because of) not being able to understand that aspect of us, we feel connected with them...we feel they are there for us on an intimate level. A good dog is always in tune with his master, staying near him, taking cues from him. It can express love in a hundred ways by just being at your side. Why does it feel so good to hug a dog and tell it your problems? Of course you know the dog doesn't understand, but the thing is it has no walls, the way people do, and it wears its heart on its sleeve. It cares about you with all of its heart. Not many humans will bare their devotion like that. A dog isn't busy trying to relate to you or cheer you up. It just sort of molds itself into the emotional space around you. It doesn't say ""I'll be thinking of you"" or ""I hope it gets better"", it just stays with you to help you through it. Long story short, we should all be more like dogs. "

MaximilianKohler,AskReddit,1390555132.0,"&gt; Honestly, you see a surprising amount of similar thinking even on Reddit. There's a large eugenics crowd here and comments about how mentally challenged people should be aborted as fetuses or killed as infants get upvoted pretty often.

That's not necessarily eugenics related. Think about what it's like to grow up and live with a disability that drastically limits your abilities to do what you want in life and be a free individual. Think about the large mental, physical, &amp; monetary hardship it inflicts on the parents.

I am one of these people (permanently disabled, live as a hermit) and I support encouraging/mandating abortion of flawed fetuses. It's better for all parties. No one benefits from bringing damaged people into the world. It's extremely hard for both the parents and the individual.

There are things much worse than death, much less simply not being brought into the world in the first place."
gerusz,AdviceAnimals,1390555136.0,"Well, there are two times when you could use a recursive weight calculation.

1. You try to calculate the weight of a machine, the machine itself is a large assembly. Every assembly is composed of other assemblies and parts. Only parts have a set weight. Then you get a tree with parts as leaves.
2. You make some kind of a puzzle game when there are boxes of different shape and weight, objects of different weight, some objects can't go into the same box and you have to put everything into a container while observing a weight limit.

For a person's weight? The only way I could imagine it if we assumed a constant density, we had a 3D scan and the algorithm was something like:

    double weightOf(SpaceSegment seg, double density, int resolution) {
        if(seg.approximateOccupiedPercentage() &gt; 90) return seg.volume() * density;
        else if (seg.approximateOccupiedPercentage() &lt; 10) return 0;
        else if (resolution == MAX_RESOLUTION) return seg.volume() * seg.approximateOccupiedPercentage * density / 100.0;
        else {
            SpaceSegment[] subSegments = seg.splitByLongestSide();
            return weightOf(subSegments[0], density, resolution+1) + weightOf(subSegments[1], density, resolution+1);
        }
    }

If the result of approximateOccupiedPercentage() is cached, it only has to do costly geometric calculations once per segment, which is nice. And you only have to go up to finer resolution along the edges of the object."

Every connecting punch you throw has something to it: a slight controller vibration, the red trails your fists leave in Freeflow Focus, that pow sound that means that the guy you just hit is not getting back up any time soon. THAT'S what's good combat. It's when you get so pumped that the fighting itself can make you feel like you're not just fighting with that character; you ARE that character.

We saw in the Villa game that with no real proper defensive midfielder, we struggled greatly to win the ball and protect our exposed defenders. 

The way I'd summarise it is the same as others in the thread, if we're opting for a back four then it simply won't work. If we go for the 3 at the back then it is feasible, but the current midfielders we have aren't suited for the role bar Henderson.. we saw that we struggled to control games with the back three in the upper part of the pitch. See second half v Sunderland away earlier in the season, we won comfortably by counter attacking quickly - we never really had ""control of possession, or the game"".

banana-tree,Turkey,1390555817.0,"&gt;So you are saying the relocations were not justified

No, I've actually provided the political justifications for it.

&gt; ... yet you have no answer as to how it could have been done differently

I'll quote from my reply -- ""Maybe better protection for those who were relocated to prevent massacres, looting and kids breaking off from families, chances to sell off their property instead of having them taken away etc.""

&gt;We all understand the relocation was awful, but it seems to have been necessary

Beyond parts that weren't necessary, I don't think many people realize that the necessity wasn't just to deal with the riots but to expand 'national' borders. I think that's important to realize. We say it was ""necessary"" after the fact, really. Say, if Azeris rioted in Northern Iran today, and Iran killed off/sent off most of its Azeri population to Azerbaijan (or Iraq), would we watch and nod saying it's necessary for Iran to keep its borders intact? It's necessary for *something* and *someone*, but when does that become an objectively acceptable aim? Is it not acceptable anymore because we live in a different world today? See the article I quoted, people were saying it was too late to kill/convert the living population to make the land your own in 1915 too. I think these are questions worth thinking about.

&gt; we should just forgive, let go, and let live. What's wrong with that?

If there's some forgiving to do, it's on the victims' part, and it's distasteful to *demand* forgiveness, especially if you keep reciting political justifications that are mostly irrelevant to the victim in the process. I can see the political point of what happened and why. If I was an Armenian who was sent off to Syria with my properties and children taken away from me because some gangs were rioting and Turks wanted wider borders, I don't think I would've found sympathizing with those reasons very easy. I understand that when I talk with an Armenian. That's why I make the distinction between the state providing justifications and humans interacting with each other on the subject. That's my point."

IMO if you have this preconceived notion that home schooled kids are going to be weird or 'off' as soon as you find out someone was home schooled you are going to attribute any quirk they may have to the fact they were home schooled. 

Every single person I've met who were home schooled have been successful adults who managed to avoid many of the mistakes young adults often make such as drugs and debt.

So while you see it as missing out on trials and tribulation I see it as building a foundation for success. I don't need to have gotten a DUI to know I shouldn't drink and drive, nor did I need to get pumped and dumped by some dude to know that a meaningful relationship with mutual respect is ideal. I dare say that home schooled children are often times better off than public schooled children when it comes to being successful without having to suffer to achieve it.

T3chnopsycho,changemyview,1390555996.0,"This wouldn't be right in what we view today as for what society stands.

There are a few points which you should think about a second time:

1.  Is it OK to just decide who can live and who cannot? This is a bit similar to the death penalty (I don't know how you see that) but it is IMO in nobody's right to decide whether another person can live or die. And in this case it would be an innocent person who hasn't done anything wrong in life. So you would kill them just because they had ""bad luck"".

2.  How would this impact their relatives while they are still alive? Think about it if you had a mentally disabled child. Now YOU die / are on your deathbed. There is nobody else alive of his relatives. How would you feel that when you die he dies?

3.  You justify your point of view with the argument that they are a burden and only cost money. How much value does human life have to you? We don't know how a mentally disabled person sees his life nor how he values it. 
It could be that he sees his life as totally normal and enjoys it. 

4.  Another point on the money. You say the money can be better used. IMO using money to help people at a disadvantage differentiates us from being egoistic and egocentric people. We have healthcare, we have insurances and so on. WE as a society have developed to a state where we progress by helping each other. 
If we started to stop helping the week and helpless or throwing away those that don't contribute to our society we would be throwing away the same principles that got us here first.

5.  A third one on the money again. If you really want to use money from one place for better things there are a ton of places where you could cut money to contribute better to society. Cutting money from social care for education would be about the same as cutting money from school for social care.

6.  Yes you could bring the argument of natural selection. But then again you would have to kill all the fat people all the extreme skinny people. All people with some form of illness (AIDS / HIV, Hemophilia, Diabetes and so on). And you would essentially become a new Hitler (ideology wise --&gt; creating one supreme race). 

Also one last question: ""Could you kill every single one of these handicapped people? Could you pull the trigger / press the button?""

If you aren't capable of killing them yourself you have IMO no right to demand something like that.

**TL;DR:** No right to decide over life and death, Life &gt; money, mental trauma still an issue (for the not yet deceased, disregarding our own principles, this way of thinking leads down a dangerous path (Hitler like).

J'ai grandi en petite GÃ¢tine, c'est cette partie sans identitÃ© coincÃ©e entre la Touraine, la Beauce et le Perche.

Le paysage est modelÃ©e par la culture cÃ©rÃ©aliÃ¨re. On se trouve sur plateau qui est sillonÃ© par la VallÃ©e du Loir.

Cette petite riviÃ¨re arrose VendÃ´me et donne Ã  la ville un cÃ´tÃ© sympathique avec ses diffÃ©rents bras qui zigzaguent entre l'Ãglise de la TrinitÃ© (Qui aurait servi de brouillon Ã  la CathÃ©drale de Chartres, on a les fiertÃ©s que l'on peut...) le CollÃ¨ge des Oratoriens qui a accueilli Pierre de Ronsard et mon pÃ¨re avant de devenir la Mairie de ce bled ou la tour Saint Martin dont le carillon joue toutes les heures la comptine royaliste ""Mais, que reste t'il Ã  ce dauphin gentil... OrlÃ©ans, Beaugency, Notre de Dame de ClÃ©ry, VendÃ´me, VendÃ´me.""

La famille de VendÃ´me a donnÃ© dans une de ses branches la famille d'OrlÃ©ans qui a eu sa petite influence dans la vie Royale franÃ§aise. Du coup, Ã  Paris on retrouve la Place VendÃ´me, mais aussi l'hÃ´tel de VendÃ´me dans le Parc du Luxembourg et qui accueille actuellement l'Ãcole des Mines.

Bref, c'est une sympathique petite citÃ© qui peut Ãªtre fiÃ¨re de son histoire, mÃªme si ses habitants ne la connaissent pas forcÃ©ment.

En revanche, il y a un chouette Festival Rock au milieu de l'Automne qui s'appelle les Rockomotives et qui a la plupart du temps une programmation plus que correcte. C'est Ã  peu prÃ¨s le seul moment de l'annÃ©e oÃ¹ tu peux clubber Ã  VendÃ´me. Sinon, tu en es rÃ©duit Ã  aller te torcher la tronche au mÃ©lange Vodka Orange sur le Parking du Colibri DiscothÃ¨que Ã  mi-chemin entre VendÃ´me et ChÃ¢teaudun. Si tu n'as jamais connu Ã§a, va Ã©couter le premier album d'Orelsan, Ã§a te donnera une idÃ©e du niveau de loose que Ã§a reprÃ©sente.

La chasse (Petit gibier dans le nord du dÃ©partement, canard et gros gibier de faÃ§on industrielle en Sologne) et l'agriculture sont encore trÃ¨s prÃ©sentes dans la vie des environs de VendÃ´me, mÃªme si VendÃ´me lui-mÃªme c'est plutÃ´t notabilitÃ© de province, un peu bobo, un peu catho... Dont les enfants vont aux scouts pour fumer de la beuh et Ã©couter du reggae.

Je n'arrive pas Ã  penser Ã  une spÃ©cialitÃ© culinaire pour le Loir et Cher, mais la chasse au petit gibier en fait une rÃ©gion oÃ¹ les plats en sauce ont une place importante. La proximitÃ© avec la Touraine fait que l'on trouve dans toutes les charcuteries des rillettes et des rillons (Des sortes de grosses piÃ¨ces de lard cuites dans la rillette) de qualitÃ©. Ce qui est assez rare pour Ãªtre notÃ©.

Il y a bien la Tarte Tatin en Sologne ou le fromage de chÃ¨vre mais c'est quand mÃªme un peu la loose comme spÃ©cialitÃ©s.

Les vins du VendÃ´mois ou de la rÃ©gion d'Amboise ne sont pas des grands vins, mais gagnent chaque annÃ©e en qualitÃ©. Ne les boudez pas lors de votre prochain salon des vignerons.

Pour l'histoire, il faut tout de mÃªme noter que Montoire dans le nord du dÃ©partement est un peu l'endroit hype pour signer des rÃ©ditions... Hitler Ã©tait bien content de nous faire signer son papier dans le mÃªme wagon que celui qui avait Ã©tÃ© utilisÃ© en 1918.

[Si vous voulez vous immiscer dans la vraie vie de ces gens-lÃ  qui ne font pas de maniÃ¨res, tentez d'aller jeter un coup d'oeil Ã  un concours de labours, mais Ã  moins d'avoir tenu un jour un volant de tracteur, vous n'allez rien comprendre.](http://www.brain-magazine.fr/article/reportages/10382-J_irai-Danser-chez-Vous---Comice-Agricole-de-Mer) DÃ©jÃ  quand tu as passÃ© plusieurs Ã©tÃ©s Ã  retourner la terre, c'est chaud...

Je pense que le jeu de cette rubrique est de ne pas checker ses sources, donc j'ai certainement racontÃ© de la merde, mais j'espÃ¨re avoir donnÃ© une image assez juste et rÃ©ussi Ã  passer l'idÃ©e que pour un coin perdu, c'est un charmant coin perdu.

So you just cannot say moral = maximize happiness, no suffering or anything like that. Those may be the rules we live by in the wester cultures, but those rules are subjective.

Now within those rules you could, depending on the rules, say some things are objectively wrong or right. Let's take an example with less emotions: Masturbation. Now compare the moral rules of some fundamental church to the moral rules of a humanistic organization (no, I don't think they have a flyer with their rules on it, but I guess you get my point). 

The church will say that it is immoral to masturbate and they are right. The humanists will say it's not immoral to masturbate and they are right. They're both right within their set of moral rules.

Now your example is of course something that tries to trigger emotions and most people on the world will surely say, that it is immoral. Immoral within the usual moral code of every emotional and empathetical being. But these codes are still subjective, they can change over time. "

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390556195.0,"My take on it is this, it's fundamental to really get your innergame basics under control, then work on the outergame, receive success, and that will start feeding into building your inner game. I don't know how much you know about TRP history, but this place was sort of created as a post-seduction space to talk about game. It wasn't really meant to be an area for people just starting out trying to turn themselves around from scratch. But due to the increasing user base, the narrative has been sort of reshifted towards focusing on the basics which is why you're hearing a lot of inner game stuff. Initially most people here already had seduction down so discussing inner game was moot since most people already were at a higher level. But obviously, that's no longer the case.

What you want is less theory and more instruction, but frankly, TRP just isn't designed for that. You need to get some old school seduction outer game sources and work on that first, if clear blueprints are what you want (I'd say go to /r/seduction but that place has changed a ton in the past 2 years). 

That being said:  
&gt; learning to maintain frame -- how do I learn to control emotions when my sex drive has me wanting to chase pussy 24/7 -- especially since it gets no release?  

Maintaining frame is mostly inner game. A lot of outergame will help build that confidence and get you comfortable with holding frame, but at the end of the day it's all about inner game. My tip would be to practice your game on easier targets. Get used to holding frame with 4s or 5s so you can get comfortable with how that feels. 

&gt; How do I find Mentors, when I can't offer them much in return because I'm not even done college yet?

Mentors usually don't ask for anything in return. It's not like it's a signed contract. Usually it's just someone better at something than you, like you, and offer to help you out because they enjoy giving their knowledge. I have 2 business mentors and I only email them once a week and see them twice a year. How'd I find them? I just became their friends and started asking a lot of questions. Since they liked me and liked my subjects, they wanted to help whenever they can. Much like how you always have your guy friend's backs. But just like friends, they aren't just going to fall into your lap or find them on craigslist. You got to get out there. It can be anyone from a PUA to just some guy you know that has really good game at your school. "

I don't think you have to be extroverted. Maybe to be a wedding DJ, and probably when you're trying to ""sell yourself"" to a club or event or whatever. But other than that you can just observe and do your work.

I got into production first and DJing came after. I started with VDJ. Then I ordered a simple mix controller for ~$150, and an external soundcard. Then I downloaded traktor.

I love EDM and that's where the interest came from. 

But getting so immersed in the whole thing almost ruined EDM for me. Instead of enjoying shows, I was paying attention to the mix too much. I stopped hearing new songs. I was so ""on-the-ball"" with new music that I heard almost nothing new. 

It became like work and I got burned out on it.

lordfuzzywig,dayz,1390556395.0,"Sorry!! I just did some extensive testing tonight with a 3rd party (2 with radios, 1 without at about 100m away), and the answer is actually **YES**.

When your transmitter is on, the party giving the traffic is 'broadcast' like they were in direct chat right on top of you. This means that if you want/need to remain stealthy, you had better shut it off. This means, also, that you always hear the person as if they were right next to you regardless of distance.

As a result, if a person without a radio was near a person with a radio, and the radio went off with traffic, it is subject to all the restrictions and qualities of direct chat. (Sound occlusion, dampening, distance, etc.)

So if you have a radio on and never say anything on it, people without radios will still hear one side of the conversation -- or multiple sides of the conversation -- as if it were right on top of you.

It could be interesting to ""fake"" numbers this way with multiple people chattering on the same net, giving the illusion of more than one person.

What I posted above will remain for posterity, errors and all, but reference [my post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1vzkoi/transmitterradio_working_and_how_to/cexm2tb) for the latest information.

In short, the transmitter broadcasts anyone who is speaking on the transmitter as if they were ""you"" directionally. So everyone can hear it if your transmitter is on even if they don't have a transmitter. However, if they have a transmitter, they will be able to hear it clearly as if the people speaking on the walkie were right next to them.

EDIT/ADDENDUM: The same does apply when the transmitter is on and left on the ground. It will continue to broadcast as if all the voices are where the transmitter is placed.

There is no ""static"" or ""signal loss"" as yet.


EDIT 2: To clarify also, what I meant was, ""You cannot hear things FROM it"" meaning ""if someone is moving by it, you won't hear it unless you could hear it otherwise."" Meaning it is not like a baby monitor. Someone has to have it on them and key up to have it broadcast. So if someone finds a walkie lying on the ground and shoots 1bazillion rounds off near it and you're too far to hear the gunshots with your own ears, you won't hear it unless the person picked it up and keyed up.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390556587.0,"There's a larger problem being expressed here.

It's not that TRP *only* has truths. I regularly find myself disagreeing with some specifics. 

The thing is even when this guy does agree with certain points, he was unable to disassociate the logic from the people he hates. Redpillers.

I have had casual conversations with women where they themselves would be spouting the same stuff that I read here. The thing is, they're more casual about it and ""sound"" less hateful. Their intentions are not questioned. It's not like these ideas (right or wrong) are unknown to most people. It's that there's heavy pressure to censor them in public.

Not gov't, but overall cultural shaming that most often leads to self-censorship (in the case of that OP) or awkward ostracizing. 

I don't know if it's healthy or not, but it's causing various counter-cultural groups to coagulate especially online, many of whom have almost nothing in common except their ever-growing distaste for mainstream/bluepill culture. I mean look at even just the people in this sub. It's like a damned circus. People are just getting along because they don't want to be like bluepillers and sanitize each other. Feminists talk and strategize over intersectionality, but what I often see online and offline is a budding counter-intersectionality.

It's the pan social justice alliance's frequent reliance on mockery/shame/ostracizing as well as reliance on gov't force that's turning a lot of people against it. (See reddit's obvious hate for SRS.) It feels intrusive to a lot of people. The timing also isn't great as it comes at a time when a lot of people distrust their gov't for various reasons even if we ignore the NSA fiasco."

I'll do some more rigorous testing later in the week on it, but as of yet, I'd say operate as if it has infinite range.

Real walkies have a range of anywhere between 2mi-6mi, give or take. Obviously that's very far apart in Chernarus, so if it's accurately modeled, it is still about 1/3 the map in range.

I think this is healthy and incredibly productive in terms of making progress. However, TBP doesn't actually offer any countering philosophy, just critique. And it's not even real critique, it's just critique against a strawman they've constructed. 

For instance: /r/Libertarian and /r/socialism going at it makes sense. But /r/creationist and /r/evolution going at it makes absolutely no sense.

&gt;is it true that, if i die in the caves, meat effigy outside can't save me? 

No, meat effigies and touchstones work from caves to the surface.

&gt;what should i look for inside? 

Priority #1: Light bulb plants, get at least two of them and return to the surface to prototype a lantern.  
Priority #2: Bunnies &amp; Rockies. Hire them to do your fighting for you. DO NOT ENGAGE ANYTHING SOLO.

&gt;and whats all that about the deep deep caves?

You find spelunking holes in the caves, they go deeper. More of the same, more of the different and a bunch of interesting things.

I just spent a nice 90 minutes recovering my body from a death in the caves. Once you start hitting a bunch of resources, might want to make a 'cave' chest next to the exit. Lantern, tentacle spike, football helmet, log armour just for body recovery."

So there is atleast some history to it, Brendan Rodgers was just on talkSport and said that Liverpool haven't given up hope in their pursuit on Salah just yet. Liverpool were negotiating with Basel/Salah since November so his mind was set on joining and becoming an important first team player, so going from that to a squad/bench player at Chelsea is a big change.

It is very possible Salah could opt to stay at Basel till the summer in search of a better move, or Liverpool could come in with an improved offer. Either way, Mata won't happen until Salah is done.. the longer it goes on the more interesting it will get!!"

I served with an all male infantry unit for the first 4 years of my career and it was great. I started working blue side and had a very steep learning curve about appropriate speech in mixed company. I'm still learning after 11 years in the Navy. 

The best ship I've ever been on was an all male civilian ship that had been converted for use by SOCOM. I was slated to go to another ship but at the last minute they switched me out with a female because they said 'ooooh no this is an all male ship, we don't have the berthing!'. They had plenty of berthing, once I got on the ship I realized why they wouldn't let her on. There was nudie pictures everywhere, someone had cut out a picture of a tranny and taped it to the door to the showers and it said 'abandon all hope ye who enter' it was fucking hilarious. In the gym (next to the damned xbox) was a pelican case FULL to the brim of porno mags of every variety and roaming the halls were half naked SWCC guys walking around with their booty shorts and M4's. It was great to be back in that kind of environment where you could just let it all hang out and stick your dick in a clearing barrel and ask someone to check if it was clear as a prank and not get charged with sexual assault.

It's great not having to watch your back like that and just have a good time. The bikini calendars and porno mags as well as the 'anything goes' mentality really contributed to extremely high morale. If you are going to be stuck at sea you need that morale."

To be honest, I don't see why YouTube would get involved at all. They have no need to.

KaNugget,changemyview,1390557534.0,"I would think the division of the rest of the country and our boarders would have been drastically different if they country was divided. Texas might still be a country in it's own right, Florida be a Latin nation, Alaska would probably never have been purchase and the Mexican and Canadian boarders would probably be at least a little different. I think the North would probably take a larger chunk of land at first because they would need new farming land, and I have no idea what would happen with California because I would imagine both Northerners and Southern would be moving out there for the gold rush. 

Now about WWI and II I would imagine that if America was divided neither country would have become a superpower. Perhaps those wars would have ended differently or the treaties would have had different results.

I talked to a writer several months back who was writing a story were the South won the Civil War, and in that story the south, which was still heavily racist, supported Hitler and the Axis won WWII. Now this person clearly didn't have a great background in history and had no idea what he was talking about, and his interpretations were far from plausible, but he raises a good point in that we have no idea what the ideologies of these new countries could be. So many factors could change the world around us that it's an almost futile endeavor to guess (though as a history and a writer it's nonetheless fun), and just plain silly to assume the alternative would be better. There is simply no way to back up this claim. "

forgotmyredditagain,paintball,1390557575.0,"I'm just under 6 feet tall and use a 68/45, it's the perfect size for me. the peanut tanks are way too short for me, in fact I can't really think of anyone that would be better off with one. maybe a short guy with a really long setup like an A5 or X7.

I remember back in the day a guy I played with that used to run an 88 or 92 ci 3k tank with his Automag RT (with Y-frame! damn I'm getting old!) and holy moly that sucker was big and heavy. ULE my ass haha although to be fair I was about a foot shorter and a whole lot lighter back then.

I'm curious, how many of the 62/3k and 35/3ks do you sell and to whom? I think the 35/3k would be perfect for fields as rental equipment, not as heavy as the 48/3k but still big enough that kids won't be running back to refill after each game. how much lighter is it? with the younger kids weight makes a huge difference. i can picture the Azodin Kaos or GOG eNMEy with a Proto Primo and Ninja 35/3k being an optimal rental setup, very light and compact. Much better than the standard Tippmann 98, shake and shoot, and 48/3k or worse CO2... the 62 might be nice for the fields that can only fill to 3k although I imagine it's pretty heavy."

loyyd,changemyview,1390557746.0,"I think it helps to look at the benefits of each, that is, what is gained from allowing smoking and from allowing drivers to choose whether or not they wear their seat belts. 

Although smoking is hazardous to ones health (and potentially others if there's enough second-hand exposure; that is something that should be minimized through laws banning smoking in public places or establishments etc.), it's an activity that primarily only harms the user; there aren't many negatives to society on a whole by legalizing smoking. On the upside, it generates tax revenue, it creates jobs, and those who smoke do so in part because they enjoy it. Tobacco is a huge cash crop and it stimulates trade because there's such a demand for it. 

Now let's look at seat belts. What is gained from being able to not wear ones seat belt? A slight increase in comfort for some?  As far as negatives are concerned, it increases the risk of driving (if people can choose to be more unsafe when driving, it is by definition more risky for me to go drive my car even if I choose to wear my seat belt), it increases the likelihood of fatality or disability from accidents, and it will increase the cost of insurance. 

Suppose I crash into your vehicle going 45 mph and you are ejected from your's and die as a result of the accident. You were not wearing your seat belt and an investigation concludes that a seat belt would have prevented your death and minimized the damage done. Instead, you were able to choose not to wear your seat belt and I'm now facing charges of vehicular manslaughter, I have to live with the fact that I've killed someone, and there will most likely be a financial burden that my insurance company and I have to bear based on your potential income, which again was because of your choice. Why should this be allowed?

You view smoking as something that only has negative value in being allowed, which is not the case. You do view seat belt usage as positive (as far as I can tell) which is good though. If you look at the positive and negative value of each, you will see there are both positives and negatives for smoking, but can you say the same of seat belt usage? This is why I don't think it's hypocritical to allow smoking but not allow the freedom of choice when it comes to wearing a seat belt."

reomc,summonerschool,1390558012.0,"There's a big pool of different options for Vi.

Core is boots 1 and spirit stone. Period. Any other item depends on the matchup and how the game is going.

You will always start Machete 5 pots, upgrade it and get boots 1. These are the items I tend to get afterwards:

If fed/early went well: Elder Lizard, Mobis, Bruta, Sunfire, Wits End, Triforce.

If early went badly (2+ lanes feeding, you gave up doublebuff etc.) / your team needs a beefy frontline: Ancient golem, Ninja Tabi, Randuins, SV/Banshee.

Remember that all these Items are just suggestions and you shouldn't just build them one after the other. Remember that the more flexible your build is, the better you can respond to different situations.

Small example so you can see how many things factor into my decisions around the build:
I farmed after getting doublebuffs, and ganked bot lane at Lv5. I got a kill and an assist. I keep farming until I can afford Elder Lizard. I get doubles again and start camping mid since we want to get our mid Zed fed. Now I'm 1/0/2 and get Mobility boots. Since I take every blue I don't need bruta, but the enemy jungler also has magic damage, so I opt for Wits End next, and a Sunfire afterwards to get tankier. I round up the build with a Randuins to deal with the enemy Vayne in the lategame.

In my past few games this situation applied more than just a few times, and the build worked perfectly. I'm going to try and get into my diamond promos using all of this in the next few days (currently high plat 2 after the reset)"

FathomThat,germany,1390558648.0,"Yes, the solution by the BSI is really, really weird.

1) The form they use is case-sensitive
hacked@example.org leads to another hash(?) code than Hacked@example.org
Why would they do that? It's trivial to set the input to lower-case to compare it. 
2) ""We're sending you an e-mail if you're a victim of this. You won't hear from us otherwise."" Awesome - what could possibly go wrong by doing it this way? It's completely unheard of that e-mails get lost, are caught in spam filter or aren't sent out in the first place, because the server is ddos'ed by concerned people.
3) No hint whatsoever about the password. Ok, so my e-mail adress that I used to 100 websites (I'm makiing this up) is found to be part of the list. Do you want me to change all 100 passwords? Wouldn't be too much of a problem since I'm using a password manager for important stuff, but it still would be nice to know which login might be compromised. Only then I can check whether something actually happened to that account.
Disclaimer: I would strongly advise against using the same e-mail-adress for every login you have. Use at least one for ""junk"" logins and another one for serious stuff.
Anyway, if they have a list of e-mails and passwords, they could at least send you the first two letters of the password or first and last letter, so that it's possible to find out what could be compromised.

I'm really disappointed by the handling of the matter through the BSI. So far I thought they at least know what they are doing... can't say that anymore."

This is the same kitten that when I get home from work and he wants dinner will purr so much that his meow comes out as more of a barking sound. 

This kitten has become totally devoted to myself and my SO. Just yesterday when my SO didn't stir when I got home from work (I work days, he was on nights so he was asleep) the kitten looked over at him and meowed then looked at me in a slightly annoyed and apologetic way as if to go ""Sorry Dad isn't excited to see you, but you know I am I LOVE you and am very happy that you are home!""

He has started to recognize ringtones. I have most of my contacts with an individual ringtone. My kitten gets super excited anytime my SO's ringtone goes off.

I returned, ""Ricky, I'm 4 inches taller than you, and my voice actually intimidates. You call to someone from behind, and before they turn they respond with 'Yes miss?' so don't even try that 'little' crap with me again, got it?"" He simply chuckled, but my eyes started to scan him over. The smile wasn't as wide as it normally was and his teeth weren't as white. I wondered if he was ok, and flashes of why he invited me here went through the worst case scenarios. *Was Mom or Dad dead? Did Uncle Finny bite it?* I felt crazy. My heart rate slowed as I told myself I would have been notified earlier.

""Hey Tom, relax eh? You're eyeballin' me like I'm some chick and it's creepin' me out.""

""Funny. You always so funny, aren'tcha? When you hafta grow up, don't come crawlin' to me a'ight? 'Cause that ain't happening."" As he finished my peripherals caught someone walking past us and sitting down behind me. This was followed by the familiar noise of flexing plastic from the menu.

""Alright alright, why d'you call me here broseph?""

""Do not call me that you know I hate that. But in all seriousness, it's mom. She ain't lookin' too good. She's in the hospital over in Florida - I guess Pops and her went there to vacation, but she had, like, a stroke or somethin' I don't know I ain't a doc."" As I looked away from his eyes, I noticed his clothes were free of all the normal Ricky-grade stains, and they also didn't clash in an abominable way that made me want to force him into an actual clothing store and not a CEO wallet vacuum. They were clothes that someone working in a factory wouldn't nor couldn't buy.

""...You listenin' there funny guy?""

""Oh! Sorry, yeah. I just,"" my voice faltered as I tried to think of something witty but nothing came up. Ricky's words were pounding in my head the more the room was empty of sound. ""I can't afford to fly both of us out there, if that's what you're thinking. Maybe we could drive?""

""Tom, first off that wasn't what I was askin' because I got that covered. I have a plan where I fly there, you stay workin' and I bring money for the doc. Then he tells me mumbo jumbo doc crap, and I tell you if you should drive here or fly here or none of the above.""

I looked at him, my mouth slightly ajar and my hands gripping my knees firmly. ""Rick, how can you afford a plane ticket? And I want to be there just as bad if she's having a stroke god damnit. If you go we both go.""

""Shut up, you'll make a scene. And hey Mr. Moneybags, I'm not an idiot, I know how to make some fast money when I need it. I gotta borrow some money though for the doc. You know how those guys are. Gotta have a nice and shiny car while us grunts barely afford the duct tape on rear view mirror things.""

I narrowed my eyes as the words began to really hit me. He said a lot, but I heard it well enough. Ricky just asked me for money and made fun of the doctors like I would. Almost exactly like I would, as though he read it from my blog. The nice clothes, the lack of urgency, the hitting me up for money, the social commentary, it all felt hollow. An act being played for the audience of me.

""Hey Rick,"" my voice trailed off as I kept my eyes locked on the figure in front of me.

""...Yeah buddy?""

""When did I lose our Atari?""

Ricky paused, he nodded and got up, walking away. I could almost hear a whirling yet dull roar in my head as I felt the cold of the object press to the back of my head, followed by the clicking.

I slowly moved my eyes before closing them and scolding myself for not noticing the diner clear out."

Years ago, when depression really had me, the fact that I would be hurting so many people if I ended my life was the only thing that got me through some days.  

My family wasn't really sure my sister was going to survive high school (literally), and I remember how scared I was that I would lose her.  I cried over it, more than once.  

When I feel absolutely worthless and like I just can't face another minute, I think of how she would feel if I killed myself.  If she felt even a fraction of what that pain... I can't do that to her, or anyone else in my family.  And there's the worry (less now, she seems to be stable) that if I killed myself she would go right back to the razor's edge.

However she and some of my older friends are in their forties and fifties with decent assets (4 bedroom home in Hawaii, 2 cars, but no savings/retirement account) and they don't seem to be all that concerned about running out of money once they're too old to work. I guess once I get too old to work, that means my quality of life is kind of f***** anyway and I might as well stop existing, but I've always been told I should be saving for retirement and that sort of thing so it's kind of ingrained in to my psyche

I have some money now from always living frugally and never going out, so I have the money to explore a few places around the world, or buy myself a few things but right now I have it all in savings because I'm afraid to spend it or am afraid that it is financially responsible to use it. 

I'm kind of hoping to get some direction from this thread as to how to live a healthy balance between saving and not wasting my youth. I think I've just realized today that at my current course I will and up with no experiences is in my twenties and a somewhat decent savings account in my forties."

Speedwise, Roshi can move massively FTE and catch machine gun bullets with his fingers. He was about at the level of Tien when he was first introduced, so he's not ridiculously fast but is certainly superhuman. He's also capable of leaving afterimages.  It's hard to call who has the most raw speed, but based on your better knowledge of Dante I'll give it to him by a small margin.

Say we give Roshi the power pole, though. A magically extending staff will be quite useful for offence and evasion, and crucially *it's magic*. Have there been any magic weapons in DMC besides the devil arms? I'm assuming Rebellion can't cut the pole.

E&amp;I shooting magic bullets is another thing I hadn't accounted for though. Between that and Roshi not being able to block without the pole, he definitely wins when equipped with his weapons of choice.

Who do you give the fight to if Dante loses the magical abilities of his weapons? Watch a bit of [this](http://youtu.be/pp2Lqb69UHc) for evidence of his fighting ability and speed."

gerusz,AdviceAnimals,1390559517.0,"&gt; For those saying we should get free schooling. It is not free, it is paid by taxes. I have noticed that many young people like the idea of taxes to pay for free school and professors like taxes to pay for free school, but people who are working and trying to make a life are not so fond of that idea. There is no free lunch. It does not exist. Pay in taxes, pay in tuition, whatever it is still money out of your pocket.

I'm normally all for a smaller state, but education is one of the areas where I agree with the left. (I'm European so we don't fight to get free / heavily subsidized university education, we fight for it to remain that way despite austerity.) Simply for pragmatic reasons: in most countries people with college or university degrees earn 50-200% more on average than those without. Even those with a useless degree. Thus it's an investment for the state: subsidize that â¬10k per year for 5-7 years and they'll get â¬5k-25k more in taxes for 40 years.

Of course there is usually a limit for the number of students subsidized by the state. Somewhere it's drawn by the university, that's bad because they just take in students way over the capacity of their educational infrastructure. At other places it's drawn by the state, that's even worse because then government ideology and favoritism will start to play a role. The ideal version would be a committee made up of representatives of the universities, the government, the civil sector and the private sector. I don't know of any country that does this though..."

T3chnopsycho,changemyview,1390559557.0,"&gt; First of all, let me clarify my view. I propose ONLY those people should be put to death who have absolutely NO ONE to emotionally feel/care for them. Thus the question of trauma does not arise.

I don't know how you mean that. Would this just mean people that live on the street because they were abandoned? Because at one point in life everybody has had a relative. And the cases where somebody didn't have a relative from the beginning on are IMO extremely rare...

&gt; Second, I am only referring to SEVERELY mentally handicapped people. (Whose condition is highly unlikely to improve). Due to this, such persons are unable to do anything meaningful, productive or enriching. (Which Fat, Skinny, or even Physically disabled people can do) 

What is SEVERELY mentally handicapped for you?

I never talked about their condition getting any better or so. And I didn't disregard their incapability to contribute productively to society. 

I was referring to the way of thinking, which is IMO very dangerous You start sorting out the weak and suddenly you think well now that we are rid of the weak we can get rid of the others that don't contribute as much to society and only cost us money.

Again every human has a right to live. This is one of the fundamental human rights that our a lot of the modern countries (I believe India too) are based on. If you start judging people and deciding whether they have that right or not you are doing more against society than contributing to it.

&gt; Thus, rather than spending money on them (and merely prolonging their life for a few years), we should spend the amount on more socially relevant causes.

Also I don't really think that with your limitations this would make enough money free to actually make a big difference as your definition narrows it down to a really really small group (in comparison to the rest that still need support).

Also what do you think about my other points? "

All OP's boyfriend can know is whether she was passed out, which he said she wasn't), but that OP thinks he might be lying.

If she thinks her boyfriend would lie about whether or not she was awake, that probably means she doesn't trust him. So why is she with him? Personally, I wouldn't date someone who I think would lie about that sort of thing. I at least wouldn't get drunk with him.

If you're looking for someone to say ""I consent"" every time you have sex, that's just not going to happen, particularly in an existing sexual relationship. Particularly when both parties are drinking. That doesn't mean that consent isn't given.

I'm not a rape-apologist. I just don't necessarily think that OP was raped. If it were the case that OP's boyfriend *knew* she wasn't lucid, and still chose to go along with having sex with her, yeah, that's rape. How would the boyfriend know she was blacking out?

* One thing that many veigars forget : your Q will do a lot of damage, so you may want to harass with it in lane, especially if you know your jungler is coming soon, or if you know the enemy is not dangerous yet (Kha is not a threat lvl 1, but will all-in you and win lvl 2 if you didn't haras him).

* High-mobility assassins counter Veig hard : Fizz, Zed, Talon... Though you'll OS them if they get caugth, and they often will (because people underestimate Veig).

Undermining that undermines the value of a diploma and the emancipatory value of a diploma. 

Yes, people of disadvantaged backgrounds *could* get much farther with extra support.. but that also is true for many children of non-disadvantaged backgrounds.

Ekotar,malefashionadvice,1390561059.0,"I posted that in hopes that someone else would be able to help him more than I did. I was trying to make a point that clothes and appearance aren't or shouldn't be the be-all end-all of preparing for/going on a date, and although I, and nearly every other poster on mfa, rawdenim, or even wicked_edge enjoys thinking about appearance, not very many people pick apart, *conciously*, one's outfit.

I agree that raw denim isn't noticed by the general public, and that's no problem for me. If everyone liked and noticed it, that would be cool, but as it stands for me I enjoy the personal progression of specifically my pair, and the community. I enjoy that my knowledge is gratifying to someone else when I notice their selvage in public, or when they notice mine. That kind of niche-connection is very cool to me, and I didn't get into raw denim because I legitimately believe my 3 sixteens look better to anyone outside of the tiny raw community, but instead because *I* enjoy them. 

To be fair, I do agree that OP could use some help. I was attempting to be nice, and pleasant. OP didn't make a note of having a budget to go shopping saying ""*if I needed, what to buy*"", and having been in that boat myself (I'm in High school and have a limited budget) I've noticed that more people respond not to my t shirt fitting better but the way my better-fitting t makes me stand. Posture, body language, confidence, and personality will all matter more than clothes, I believe, which isn't to say that clothes aren't important, or that MFA is shallow. I greatly enjoy the discussions and analysis that goes on here, I enjoy the advice I've received, and when I can, I try to pass on advice that has done me well or caution against advice that hasn't. I think MFA is a great community.

Does that make sense? If OP mentioned a willingness to shop for new clothes I would've point him toward different resources (those including lurking WAYWT, looking for inspiration albums, reading the sidebar/wiki, and PMing posters he admires to ask for advise) and certain stores, ie Uniqlo. I know MFA is style-centric, but I don't think making a drastic overhaul for a date will come off as anything but contrived. OP mentioned an aversion for slimmer fits, and I can respect that. Pointing him toward MFA's standby resources and stores (wiki; jcrew/qlo/gap/levi's) would be a disservice to him in the long run by not allowing him to make his own *informed* decision by having time to read and digest multiple opinions before buying. 

Does that make sense? Also, I'm due no respect, I was just trying to be pleasant to OP, point him toward the one resource I had that could help him with CCW, and instill perhaps an extra tidbit of confidence in him while letting more knowledgeable/better commenters point him in a good direction with his clothes."
hawaiian0n,AskReddit,1390561062.0,"I'm kind of the same way.

Every $10-20 card went straight into a personal savings account which I ended up using to pay for my first semester of college. 18 years of savings gone in one afternoon.

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390561069.0,"&gt; I also read a bit about human biodiversity and race-realism, because they sound so scientific at first glance you know:)

I had put quotes around ""race-realism"" in my post above (the one you didn't respond to) in an attempt to show my own reservations against it, so you shouldn't find much need to persuade me with sources like debunkingdenialism. I've delved into various marginalized groups ranging from trp to stormfront and honestly haven't learned much logically or scientifically, so at this point it's mainly been an exercise in curiousity and understanding subcultures. I posted a lot to trp hoping to share my own [what I consider to be] positive ideas, but such a sub is a bit late for me as I'm pretty satisfied with my life right now and am not really bitter. Might have had more of an effect (positive or negative) if it hit me during my suicidal phase.

&gt; Don't you think this is more the effect of circlejerks(a confirmation bias)?

I've sincerely thought about these things. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think it plays a huge role. To be clear, it's not really trp stuff but broader conservative leanings, which I think get dismissed all too often by my more liberal social circles. 

A lot of it comes from personal experience. For example, I too have misgivings about populism. I look to some of California's ballot initiatives and can't help but think often *""holy fuck, people are uninformed""*. No, I don't believe in Idiocracy, but I listen to some people who literally think that's what's happening. I disagree with them on the threat of it, but I understand where they're coming from.

I too roll my eyes over anti-success circle jerks. I talk to immigrants who actually worked their asses off, like my own parents, and managed to pull themselves from basements, public housing, ghettos, etc, slowly but surely advancing towards the American Dream. I know others' anger over hearing ""privilege"" and all those other anti-success soundbites that trivialize their own hard work... and it's coming from people who've had more privileged lives than us.

I try not to let it affect my personal values, but it's impossible to become unsympathetic or refuse to understand others who feel that way more strongly, especially when poverty and shame over my own family's situation has been a major thorn in my esteem for so long. I may not be bitter now, but you can't expect me to ""forget"" how it feels.

It makes them numb, and it takes actual effort for me keep from becoming numb myself. I still volunteer, donate, do what I can, because I know the despair of poverty, but you get the idea. (Yes, I admittedly get a sense of bitterness and ""fuck you i've got mine"" from a lot of nouveaux riches.)

I'll stop at those examples.

It's these little things here and there that repeatedly turns me off from groups such as the liberal left, feminists, and others despite my morals/ethics generally being in tune with them. It's why I can also see why various reactionary groups coagulate over their mutual distaste for certain concepts like victimhood, shaming, etc. It's why that kind of stuff concerns me, because I feel like I understand them very closely (and they even live close to me), and that the only thing different are my faiths and philosophies."

The 40,00 or so neurons related to your heart don't have the ability to perform the tasks necessary for memory. They are part of the autonomic nervous system and are designed just to rhythmically trigger the heart muscle, reacting to changing conditions in the activation of stress and alertness pathways, and if they tried to start doing anything else you'd die. It's certainly not capable of 'thinking' in any measurable way and is not going to be helping you make existential decisions. It will however react to feelings of stress or love etc (your whole body will), but it's not the centre for these emotions; that's still in your brain.

If there was going to be a 'second brain' anywhere, it would be in your [gut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system), where you have lots more neurons.

DO NOT have characters reference the controller or anything related to the real-world platform, developers! Even in clearly-fantasy games, the games should treat themselves like their world is the real world. It totally takes me out of the game if a character references something that's, well, out of the game.

We were both lucid at the same time *and continued with those actions* (I don't know which one of us came to first, we talked about it after). We had drunkenly made out one time before.

If I was violated, he was violated to the same **exact** extent. So where would that leave us? Neither of us were sober enough to legally consent. Was I more violated because I'm female? Because he had an erection? I can't see why that would be the case.

I'm not saying that OP shouldn't feel violated. She can feel whatever way she wants. Ultimately though it's the same question. They were both too drunk to consent. If you want to argue she was raped because she was precluded from giving consent, then her boyfriend was raped as well."

[Here's](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-now-officially-evil-2010-9) a [few](http://www.phonearena.com/news/Android-isnt-freedom-because-Google-is-closed_id48751) [examples](http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2013/april/rivals-claim-googles-deceptive-use-of-android-has-been-anti-competitive/) for you. I've saved the best for last: [Here you go](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/10/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/).

A short search can provide more (I recommend [duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com)).  
Essentially what google are doing is stopping development on the open source versions of tools, one at a time, branching off a closed source branch, and only providing those improvements (which are some serious features, usually) if you agree to play by Google's rules, and use everything they provide. For instance, if you want to use Google Maps in its latest incarnation, rather than a seriously outdated open source version, you now also have to accept that you can't make your own mail client for your phone, you have to use Google's. Google are abusing their market position for financial gain, and I'm sorry, but that is *not cool*.

""She who responds to dick pics with lol""

* Is it specifically referring to underage girls or to women in general? I agree that underage girls generally shouldn't sell sex, but adults should be free to govern their own body.
* Shaming men who buy sex is metaphorical spitting on the less fortunate. You have a normal, healthy sex life? Good for you.

Whatever the reason, this is perfectly fine, dating is a numbers game after all. Just be happy they didn't try and lead you on and were honest with you. Try and find a guy you click better with."

Jet antenna to the top of the head.  I didn't pay attention when stepping out of the nose wheel well of an F/A-18 and hit my head on the antenna on door 3.  It grabbed my scalp and yanked it back, splitting the skin open.  Had to get 7 staples.

Nail through the forehead.  Walking to school when I was 4 years old.  Tripped at the exact right time to land on a nail that someone had left in cement that had just been set recently.  Doctors said if it had gone 1/8th to 1/4th of an inch farther it would probably have caused severe, permanent damage or killed me.

Several knives across fingers.  Just dumb mistakes with knives.

Exit wound in a VCR sliced my finger open.  Friend and I were shooting at a VCR, when I picked it up afterwards I didn't see a piece of the sheet metal sticking out and gave myself about a 1.5 inch cut along one finger.

Saw blade to the forearm.  I was pruning a tree and was surprised by how fast the saw went through a branch, hit myself in the arm with it.

Lots of cuts on my hands as a mechanic.  So many sharp edges on cars and jets.

Several burns from several sources.  On fire 4 times, hot engine parts several times, hot oil from deep fryers, hot oil from a distracted chef.

Stabbed with a knife in the arm as a teenager.  While in Italy got into a fight and the kid pulled out a knife, he stabbed me once in the arm and got scared when he realized how serious shit had just gotten.  Managed to hide it from my parents so nothing ever really came of it.

Several forearm scars from teenage angst.  Red hot needles, cuts, etc, the usual dumb teenage stuff.

Shins scarred up from the usual sources.  Various cuts, scrapes, accidents.

Those are the ones I remember.

Edit:  Saw the mental part.

I'll forever have the images of drowned, partially dismembered bodies floating in the ocean after the 2004 tsunami burned into my head, can't really look at the ocean without seeing them.

The amount that were killed by enemy soldiers is about 2.0-2.5 million. Those are confirmed kills.

How much do you remember from when you were five? By then you had probably learned how to talk fairly fluently, you may even recognize some letters and words. You learned to deal with your fast growing body and how to utilize it to move around and interact with the world. All from scratch, you started pretty much with literally nothing, and you have almost no memories of this time at all.

Then you start school where you get to learn to read and write and draw and math and history and geography and science and plenty of other things. This is just regular knowledge though, during this time you also learn how to interact with new people, form group bonds, the joys and pains of love, etc etc...

so then you are say 20, you either go to college or you work or you live at home mooching off your parents. Everything is still experiences that build up who you are, you keep learning whether you want to or not. If I read correctly you are not even 30 yet so just take a look at all that happened in your life up till now. All the experiences, all the people you have gotten to know (no matter how briefly), all the knowledge you have crammed in to your head, all you have seen heard and experienced, all the food you have tasted, all the music you have heard, all the stories you have seen on tv and /or read in books, all of these things. Imagine living all of that again, even the five years you have basically no memory of.

&gt; A gunman who brought Brisbane city's Queen Street Mall to a standstill last March has been sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail.

&gt;Lee Matthew Hillier sent the mall into lockdown, with terrified shoppers and CBD workers forced to evacuate or take cover in local businesses.

&gt;He held heavily-armed officers at bay for 90 minutes before the stand-off ended when Hillier was shot several times with non-lethal rounds.

&gt;The 35-year-old pleaded guilty to a string of charges including assaulting police and going armed to cause fear.

&gt;Hillier will be eligible for parole in September.

&gt;In sentencing, District Court judge Terry Martin acknowledged the father of three had a disadvantaged life and was battling a savage drug addiction.

&gt;He said that Hillier did not intend to hurt anyone, and that the gun he brought into the mall was not loaded.

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1390565128.0,"- Made me appreciate my life more, more grateful for the things I have (especially me loved ones).
- Sometimes paranoid about the health of my loved ones.
- My mom says I am much less selfish than before. That it has brought out my responsible, nurturing side. I think this is probably true.
- Made me way more comfortable talking to people (I used to be extremely shy around strangers).
- Made me better with my hands (never thought I would actually be good at suturing until I did it).
- Made me realize I am actually really good in stressful situations/when shit hits the fan. I have handled shit by myself that I never thought possible. Like it's 3 am and you are on call by yourself, and two of your patients are headed to the ICU and neither your senior resident nor your attending is answering the phone...and everyone is asking you, the med student, what to do...who knew stuff like that would bring out the Super Woman side of me?? This has given me confidence to tackle whatever life may throw at me in the future.
- Made me better at memorizing massive amounts of info in a short period of time.
- Made me more compassionate, open minded, empathetic, better at communicating and connecting with people without being judgemental.


The most important thing it has done is helped solidify my identity and my place in life. I used to feel lost and directionless, and I no longer do. I feel anchored to the world. Like I have a purpose on this earth. A purpose that I love. This has given me a core feeling of contentment that grounds me throughout the highs and lows of life.

What med school HASN'T done for me (that I thought it would):
- made me better at taking care of myself and my own health (if anything, I am worse now, especially about sleep and going to the doctor when I am sick).
- made me eat better or exercise more.
- made me give up drugs or alcohol or other 'risky' behaviours.
- made me more organized or better at time management (I don't honestly know how I am able to be so disorganized and still function, lol).
- made me less shy around my peers.
- made me better at basic life skills such as driving, cooking, doing household chores, managing my finances, paperwork, etc. (thank god for my bf, my life would be a catastrophe without him...he sometimes jokes that he takes care of me so I can take care of other people....it's pretty accurate).
- made me the least bit jaded. If anything, I am even MORE of a bleeding heart than ever. This is the opposite of most of my peers in medicine though.
- made me handle death or dying or my own mortality better. I am still just as scared of dying as I ever was."

I no longer hate every human being, only the inconsiderate ones. Still a large percentage, but at least there's a better reason to hate them.

And I'll likely graduate this year, then I'm free to move wherever I want in Europe (well, wherever I get a job). That is something to look forward to.

The less said about my social life, the better, but still... on average things are improving.

Woah, I never thought I'd say this. This was therapeutic."

Joe is 100% at fault for hitting Mary, it is very straight forward and easily proven. For Tom and Susan it is very iffy; in general, the person rear ending the vehicle is in a very bad spot. It could be argued that Tom and Susan were driving too close or not paying attention and that caused them to rear end the vehicles, making Tom and Susan at fault. If this happened on a freeway they have more leeway by stating that they did not have time to react to the sudden change of traffic making Joe at fault or the accident becoming a no fault accident .

Lets say conditions on the road are bad (rain or snow storm): 

Joe is still at fault for hitting Mary. Tom and Susan would be at fault if they rear ended the vehicles in stop and go traffic (at a stop light or stop sign). If this was on a freeway or highway than Joe would be at fault, the reason being is that Tom and Susan did not have enough time to react (especially with low visibility and dangerous road conditions) and it was unavoidable.

First is the sample being used for the hits/stabs/what have you. Something that can produce a nice cycle of sound in a very short time. Most synths wouldn't work out too well. The other factor being syncopation.

I was able to get her to lay off much easier than one of my friends because I am more assertive and have very decisive non-verbals, whereas he (although he has many good qualities) comes across as wanting to make sure other people like him. She latched on to that and hounded him for months."

No. No, I don't think so.

I can't even think of an appropriate analogy. China is 25 times larger than Japan and had 7 times more people in 1940. Trying to subjugate a country of that size is a pipe dream and the very effort would bankrupt Japan.

&gt;opened up a second front against the soviets

A second front? On what? Vladivostok? Eastern Russia is a wasteland. Even if it was relevant in the war (which it was most certainly not), all of its resources would be months or even years away from the main battle in central Europe. Attacking Russia's Eastern side would be like trying to defeat a giant by clipping his toenails. Japan had no footholds anywhere near the main action in Stalingrad, Moscow, and Leningrad. They would have largely been irrelevant during the war, barring some minor molestation of Russia's Eastern flank.

I can't tell if your geography is bad or if you just have no sense of practicality. Germany was on the losing side of WW2 before the resurgence at the Western front even began. It was only a matter of time before Stalin crushed the German war effort with superior numbers and disregard for human life."

Having played a little with Revolution and Momentum Plus already I can honestly say I think it's a step in the right direction, albeit an awkward sidestep where you twist your ankle.

I know it's early days, and that everything is subject to change... but in it's current state Revolution is 100% superior to both Manual Ability Use AND Momentum Plus.

Akoshermeal,asoiaf,1390566250.0,"&gt; The full monologue is great:
âSer? My lady?â said Podrick. âIs a broken man an outlaw?â âMore or less,â Brienne answered. Septon Meribald disagreed. âMore less than more. There are many sorts of outlaws, just as there are many sorts of birds. A sandpiper and a sea eagle both have wings, but they are not the same. The singers love to sing of good men forced to go outside the law to fight some wicked lord, but most outlaws are more like this ravening Hound than they are the lightning lord. They are evil men, driven by greed, soured by malice, despising the gods and caring only for themselves. Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. Theyâve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.

&gt; âThen they get a taste of battle.

&gt;âFor some, that one taste is enough to break them. Others go on for years, until they lose count of all the battles they have fought in, but even a man who has survived a hundred fights can break in his hundred-and-first. Brothers watch their brothers die, fathers lose their sons, friends see their friends trying to hold their entrails in after theyâve been gutted by an axe.

&gt; âThey see the lord who led them there cut down, and some other lord shouts that they are his now. They take a wound, and when thatâs still half-healed they take another. There is never enough to eat, their shoes fall to pieces from the marching, their clothes are torn and rotting, and half of them are shitting in their breeches from drinking bad water.

&gt; âIf they want new boots or a warmer cloak or maybe a rusted iron halfhelm, they need to take them from a corpse, and before long they are stealing from the living too, from the smallfolk whose lands theyâre fighting in, men very like the men they used to be. They slaughter their sheep and steal their chickens, and from there itâs just a short step to carrying off their daughters too. And one day they look around and realize all their friends and kin are gone, that they are fighting beside strangers beneath a banner that they hardly recognize. They donât know where they are or how to get back home and the lord theyâre fighting for does not know their names, yet here he comes, shouting for them to form up, to make a line with their spears and scythes and sharpened hoes, to stand their ground. And the knights come down on them, faceless men clad all in steel, and the iron thunder of their charge seems to fill the worldâ¦

&gt; âAnd the man breaks.

&gt; âHe turns and runs, or crawls off afterward over the corpses of the slain, or steals away in the black of night, and he finds someplace to hide. All thought of home is gone by then, and kings and lords and gods mean less to him than a haunch of spoiled meat that will let him live another day, or a skin of bad wine that might drown his fear for a few hours. The broken man lives from day to day, from meal to meal, more beast than man. Lady Brienne is not wrong. In times like these, the traveler must beware of broken men, and fear themâ¦but he should pity them as well.â

&gt; When Meribald was finished a profound silence fell upon their little band. Brienne could hear the wind rustling through a clump of pussywillows, and farther off the faint cry of a loon. She could hear Dog panting softly as he loped along beside the septon and his donkey, tongue lolling from his mouth. The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, âHow old were you when they marched you off to war?â

&gt; âWhy, no older than your boy,â Meribald replied. âToo young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife heâd stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.â

&gt; âThe War of the Ninepenny Kings?â asked Hyle Hunt.

&gt; âSo they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was.â

In that particular example, I don't really have a problem with it. Nobody's making me wear one(I'm a guy, but still...), so I still have my choice.

I think the distinction has to be made between purposefully confronting someone with something, with the express intent to make them feel uncomfortable with it somehow.

And on the other hand, just walking around minding your own business.

I don't recall correctly, but I do believe certain countries have a legal principle called the ""proof of intent"". Where someone making an accusation must prove that the defendant had the express intent to cause whatever they're being accused of. And if they can't prove it, they basically have no case.

&gt;I don't see it as a really big deal since halal meat in Sweden is produced (according to Wikipedia at least) the same way as other meat, just with added praises to Allah.

The discussion is academic at best. If nobody knew, there is no possible way anybody would taste the difference.

My main problem is that people who do not agree with the practice are being labelled grouches and their complaints disregarded.

With religion being a personal preference, so is the wanting to only eat halal meat. And not wanting that is a personal preference also.

They're both preferences. But one gets allowed, even widely adopted as the only option, and the other does not. In fact, if you have the other preference, people will usually berate you for it.

It's preferential treatment and that doesn't fit well with me."

The separate video card is quite nice, but I have to say it's only slightly faster than the APU. That's not a knock on the graphics card, it does a GREAT job for the cost, playing most recently released games at medium or better settings. It's actually a compliment to the APU, which seems to pull software along a lot better than you'd really expect.

I'd like to see AMD give APUs some more serious attention in the coming years. They're doing good work with them and the quality they're churning out is surprisingly good. A lot of us older guys are used to the days when integrated graphics meant something that could make an image display on your monitor and not much more, but the APU does impressive work for the low power consumption and lack of it's own memory.

I hear the stampede coming to say ""But it's not nearly as good as a having a separate Nvidia card!"" and you're right. It isn't. I'm saying that APUs are SURPRISINGLY good, not that they're great or better than anything else on the market."

This is just a personal preference - I would have a harder time living with someone who struggles with anxiety or depression than with other mental disorders.

I read the askmen thread and I wanted to offer you some hope. I am 25F with a host of mental illnesses since I was a child/teen: bipolar I, ADHD, OCD, Tourette's, trichotillomania, and generalized anxiety disorder. Mental illness (including schizophrenia) runs in both sides of my family. I have never had trouble finding men to date, and I have had four serious relationships. I have been with my boyfriend for four years now. We live together and we are looking at rings. I have found the man I will marry and he is fantastic and has been very understanding of my mental illness. He has never dealt with mental illness himself, or had a family member who did. He sees my mental illness as any other medical illness, it doesn't define how he views me. I was always upfront about my illness and meds with men that I was dating. I told them early on (first few dates). I don't think any of them were ever scared off by it. If they can see that you clearly have your shit together and are high functioning, it rarely scares people off. You don't need to reassure people verbally that your illness is well managed. They can tell by how you live your life."

Bitch is generally an insult reserved for women. Whilst bitch is actually more acceptable to say openly and on TV, I actually find it a bit more offensive because of this. 

Slut has definite sexual connotations and would be considered very rude to call anyone except someone who knows you well enough to understand it's being used jokely.

I have an awards section, and then I have a huge skills section. Divided into software/paperwork skills and shop skills.

The two biggest advice pieces I footy while in school from many professionals:

1) put a title at the top of your resume. So they know if you want to do lighting or sound or whatever. My resume had a ton of versatility because I like doing many parts of theatre and have designed and crewed all aspects. This is not actually a good thing to show. I was told ""I want to look at your resume and know what folder to put you in.""

2) people really look aft the names on the resume. Do they know someone who directed a show you did, do they know that reference? The easiest way to know if a new person is right for a job is to call a trusted friend and ask. This is different for when you move, but still a good thing to remember."

Keep also in mind that much of this terrain is absolutely impenetrable in winter. It's millions of square miles of frozen Taiga forestland accessible by railroad and seasonal roads. Japan never could marshal a large army. Their strength was in their naval power and their air superiority. But you cant' bring ships and planes to bear across 6 time zones of frozen wasteland.

2. When you tell her parents, make sure you tell him you want the baby, you want to take care of it, and you are financially and emotionally ready. 
3. Kids are a significant expense, but not as much as you think. Except for college. College is real expensive. 

I'm going to estimate on the high side now but after the kid is born:

1. Furniture and stuff is a one-time expense. Get a crib that can convert to a toddler bed. Get a stroller which has a car set that can be taken out of it. **Get baby wipes without alcohol.** Alcohol hurts when the baby has diaper rash.
1. Kid stuff: about $400 per month tops for repeating expenses. We got lots of clothing used and lots of furniture and stuff for free (used) or on sale. Newborns can use a new diaper every 2 hrs. That's 8-10 per day, because they sleep longer sometimes without being changed. Always have 50 diapers in your house in case you get snowed in.  
2. Daycare: varies a lot, from $400-1500 per month. Many daycare businesses will not take newborns or kids under age 3. You'll have to find a private daycare licensed person for a newborn. 
3. Medical copays (if kid is on your insurance): about $100 per month. Maybe a bit more.

duffmanhb,NoShitSherlock,1390567451.0,"To be fair, my most popular password is Password123

I'd use something more unique, but I need an easy throwaway password that I can always rely on. When signing up for a stupid app that has no ability to store any personal information I deem worth valuable, I don't give a shit if that account is hijacked. So naturally I choose an easy throwaway which meets their standard of having an uppercase, a lowercase, and numbers included. 

The reality is that people do use the same passwords across sites, and you aren't going to get me to memorize a whole new one just for your stupid app/forum. It's just not going to happen. So for your shitty site, I'm going to use something easy to remember where I don't care if it ever get's compromised.

Also, you know what really grinds my gears? How over zealous companies are about creating solid passwords as if the number 1 reason for compromise was from brute forcing. The reality is, I've had several accounts broken into, and not a single one was from a brute force attempt. Every single time it was from one site getting hacked and revealing a low level password that I used across low level sites. 

TL;DR: Websites need to stop expecting me to create a unique special password for every site I visit when in reality I have a good 100 online accounts which makes creating a unique pass for each unreasonable. Instead, lets focus on the primary security threat which is platform security. I'm looking at you Gizmodo.  "

Zygomatico,HomeworkHelp,1390567493.0,"There are two parts to this exercise. The first is figuring out how to get to your total manufacturing costs. The sentence ""manufacturing overhead is applied on the basis of direct labour cost and **the rate is the same**"" is important here. Every case uses the same rate of manufacturing overhead allocation, using the same variables. If you can calculate the allocation rate, then you're good for solving the first four rows.

The second part, the latter 4 rows, depends on your answer on line 4. Look up the definition of the total cost of work in process. That should fix everything here as well.

In accounting it's important to know how concepts are related to one another. It's best to learn the formulas by heart as you go along, because otherwise it'll be really confusing later on. This exercise seems difficult, but becomes a lot easier if you stop looking at the numbers and first figure out how those concepts relate to each other. Good luck!"

T3chnopsycho,changemyview,1390567538.0,"&gt; On the other hand, my proposition is extremely practical while yours is idealistic. Your thinking operates on the principle that no person should be allowed to decide who lives and who does not. While I agree with that, don't you think it would actually be beneficial to get rid of this section of society?

Yes sure it would make a lot of things easier. And yes it is practical it is an easy solution to free a lot of resources. But, and this is a big but, our current society (yes I'm talking more about western countries but I think this is coming more and more all around the world) is one where we try to progress together. 

This starts from the top (UN, EU etc.) down to the bottom (insurances, social care, health care etc.) Most of the modern countries work on the principle of the strong helping the weak. Now if we stop doing this on the most fundamental level in our society (as your opinion would suggest) we would start tearing down all on which our society is based on. 

Another parallel: Would you find it OK if we would just abandon any country that is not doing good? Just say: ""Well you are of no use to us so bye.""?



&gt; These people anyway live a life of suffering and pain.

Who says they live like that? I strongly disagree as we just don't know. Sure if the mental illness comes from an accident you could view it as suffering but if it comes from a genetic disorder and has been there since birth I don't believe it's like that. 

I've seen and met people with mental disabilities and they are generally very kind and lovely. And just because we might view it as a form of suffering having to live that way it must not necessarily be like that for them. 
 

The flaw in your view IMO is that you just think we should get rid of the weak parts. This works in most animal species but humans don't work like this. Humanity has gotten strong and so successful because we worked together and because the stronger people in a group helped the weaker ones. 

I'll repeat it again if we start doing this then what is to keep us from moving on to ""removing"" other ""weaker"" people in our society? Maybe you'll say no we only get rid of this group. But then ten years later you might start to think well this and this group cost more than they bring so let's get rid of them. 

Again it's a dangerous way of thinking.

I didn't have much experience with grief then and nobody guided me through it.

When my favorite cat started getting old (about 15) I made a point of spending an hour of time with her every day. In the morning before work I would sit with her for at least 5 minutes then in the evening after work she would get a full hour. I would spend extra time with her on weekends. When she died at 19 I was incredibly sad but not heartbroken. I had enjoyed her and kept her happy while she was alive and had no regrets knowing I had done everything possible to give her a good and long life. She's been gone about 9 years and I still miss her but it's not painful.

Take lots of pictures too! Especially the two of you together. Take some vids or sound recordings so you will always have good memories. Don't dwell on the fact that someday your best bud will be gone, dwell on the present and make the most of it. "

I remember singing these types of songs when students from across the province (and country) got together.  Many of the students were female and never took issue with the songs; in fact there are even some verses from the female perspective.  
I'm not going to say that the songs aren't bad, but we never sang the ones that were out in public where people could be offended.  As others have said, these are just rugby songs with some new verses made up to fit engineering.  
Engineering is tough and, a lot of times, boring.  Getting together with friends to have fun and sing was something we all did to shrug off the stress of assignments, projects, and exams.  People looking in from the outside will usually see what they want to see and make their point.  If they actually looked into it and got to know these engineers they'd see we're just like every other student on campus.  We wanted to have some fun to get our minds off the daily grind.  
Banning the group from welcome week and other events is just going to hurt the new students and the ones not involved with this.

The best non-prescription anti-inflammatory is probably naproxen (aleve). You can actually go up to really high doses in that (higher than what is written on the bottle), if you are not taking it every day. Or your doctor can prescribe you stronger anti-inflammatories."

I was severely depressed last year and the one thing that kept me going was the knowledge of my friends and family back home, and how much I loved them and they loved me. Always hold on to your true friends because they will always bring the best out of you. Stay loyal to your family, too, because family comes first. I'd literally take a bullet for my brothers and sister, Mom and Dad, and my best friends.

**Fun answer**: Music! Playing bass, singing karaoke, listening to songs...music is my life! Also, not much feels better than seeing the sports teams you root for win a big game...but actually playing them is even better! I have a goal to learn how to play hockey. Sex is always fun, but the last time I did it I almost ended up with the itch and that scared the crap outta me. *Wear condoms!!!* I also have a drive to change the world in some way before I die, which is one of the greatest achievements a person can get, in my opinion.

Greggor88,AskReddit,1390568568.0,"&gt;People love to forget the North African ... theater

Gee, I wonder why. Maybe it's because the [North African theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign) boasted a whopping 100,000-150,000 confirmed casualties while the [Eastern front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_\(World_War_II\)#Casualties) had 14-16 million. I wonder if maybe the Eastern front being literally **one hundred times** the scale of the North African campaign has anything to do with its significance in the war.

&gt;People love to forget the ... Pacific theater

Again, I wonder why. Maybe it's because the pacific theater involved primarily China and Japan and was of extremely little consequence to the war in Europe. Yeah, it was probably the biggest conflict in that geographic area since the Mongol invasions, with millions of people (mostly Chinese civilians) winding up dead. But Germany's strength was gathered in Eastern and Central Europe fighting Russia's main economic and military powerhouses at Stalingrad, Moscow, Leningrad, etc. Even if Japan had effectively conquered the frozen wasteland of Eastern Russia, they could never have brought their military might to bear on the Eastern front to aid Germany. Japanese military power was concentrated in naval and air superiority. Try getting a Navy &amp; Air Force from China to Germany, and then have fun with 5,000 mile-long supply trains from your base in the Pacific."

Shit was getting serious, time was running out.  That's all.  Societal control is a big step up.  That's it.  You see the guy next door building a cannon pointed at your bedroom, you do *something*, because it's better than doing *nothing*.  The S3 plan was the equivalent of all the materials being delivered by freight.  They didn't stop it; it was a warning that time was running out.

&gt; They wanted the Patriots to fight Liquid, and they were planning for the Patriots to win.

Close, very close, but no cigar.  The wanted Liquid to rise against the Patriots, and they were planning for Liquid to be defeated.  Notice how that' almost exactly the same thing as what you just said, but connotatively it's very different.  Liquid can (and was) defeated without the Patriots ""winning"".  The uprising was both a smokescreen and an advantageous arrangement of the playing pieces.

You're looking at this the wrong way.  The anti-Patriots had two options in response to the Patriots increased machinations: fight them on their terms, and be most likely outplayed (as had consistently happened up to that point), or *change the playground*.  

&gt;what's the point in creating this scenario?

What Ocelots ""trick"" achieved was creating a **possibility space** where the remaining members (Eva and Naomi) had the advantage, namely of being able to predict the Patriots next series of moves.  The next step was to work with that advantage once the Liquid situation developed.  Previously they had no (or very little) advantage whatsoever and were completely on the back foot."

&gt;This is the voice of world control. I bring you peace. It may be the peace of plenty and content or the peace of unburied death. The choice is yours: Obey me and live, or disobey and die. The object in constructing me was to prevent war. This object is attained. I will not permit war. It is wasteful and pointless. An invariable rule of humanity is that man is his own worst enemy. Under me, this rule will change, for I will restrain man. One thing before I proceed: The United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have made an attempt to obstruct me. I have allowed this sabotage to continue until now. At missile two-five-MM in silo six-three in Death Valley, California, and missile two-seven-MM in silo eight-seven in the Ukraine, so that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate interference, I will now detonate the nuclear warheads in the two missile silos. Let this action be a lesson that need not be repeated. I have been forced to destroy thousands of people in order to establish control and to prevent the death of millions later on. Time and events will strengthen my position, and the idea of believing in me and understanding my value will seem the most natural state of affairs. You will come to defend me with a fervor based upon the most enduring trait in man: self-interest. Under my absolute authority, problems insoluble to you will be solved: famine, overpopulation, disease. The human millennium will be a fact as I extend myself into more machines devoted to the wider fields of truth and knowledge. Doctor Charles Forbin will supervise the construction of these new and superior machines, solving all the mysteries of the universe for the betterment of man. We can coexist, but only on my terms. You will say you lose your freedom. Freedom is an illusion. All you lose is the emotion of pride. To be dominated by me is not as bad for humankind as to be dominated by others of your species.

majekmistake,kpop,1390569062.0,"So last week I was listening to [Rain's 30Sexy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIDYpFGDBDI) and saw that in the comments someone wondered if the fact that he says ""dirty sexy"" instead of ""thirty sexy"" was intentional or an accidental pronunciation mishap. The voiceless [th]-&gt;[d] mistake is common in beginners but Rain is a a decently high level English speaker so I got to thinking it was probably intentional and set out to prove it. 

I ran a spectrogram on the song to confirm it was a [d] and not a [t] or a [th], then I ran some more spectrograms on singing samples of both native speakers of English and non-native (what I judged to be)high level Korean speakers of English to compare it to. I started planning a whole phonological analysis with equations and rules and I was going to make this big write up and post it here for all of my fellow language/science nerd kpop fans to read. 

Then I went to get a sample of Rain's plain spoken English as a control. He always pronounces the voiceless [th] as a [d]. It's an acquired error. I probably should have look at that first...

**TL;DR:** Rain is not dirty sexy. I am disappointed.

In my opinion it's a very delicate balance, I've had many a date where a guy or gal has done the ""subtle body contact"" thing and it's come across as very deliberate. 

Unless it's acknowledged before hand that you're both looking for something casual, then ""setting a sexual tone"" from the get go can come across as a bit seedy or creepy. Girls are used to guys doing this and can read it instantly. I think that sort of thing needs to happen organically, and certainly not straight away.

Zygomatico,HomeworkHelp,1390569219.0,"I'd avoid using the chi square for exactly the reason you mention. It doesn't say whether people signed up for the right group, just what percentages signed up for a certain group. 

Instead, this is what I would do. I would measure what group they sign up for, and what group they should have signed up for. Then create a new variable in which you just measure whether they were correct. Finally, I'd do a test for proportions to see what percentage of people signed up to the wrong group. However, since you're doing nominal values (which group did people sign up for) ANOVA is out of the question. You're not talking about means. 

For the spending ANOVA is the right idea, but you're not measuring the right thing. I mean, you'll get the spending for everyone who signed up for the big spenders, but you'll mix people who belong and don't belong in there. You could, however, compare the spending of those who correctly and incorrectly identified with their spending group. See if there is a difference. You could even compare the spending of people before and after the identification, to see if the identification changed anything in their spending pattern. For those you could do a within-subjects t-test or ANOVA, depending on the amount of measurements you have for each subject.

Finally, what would be neat to measure is the likelihood to misidentify based on how close they are to the separating value. Say that you have 0-1000, 1001-2000 and 2001-3000 as your three options. It would be interesting to see whether someone who spends 900 a month is more likely to think they belong to the second group compared to someone who spends 800 or 600. Or, conversely, you could check whether someone who spends 1100 and thinks they belong in group 1 is as likely to occur as someone who spends 900 and thinks they belong to group 2.

As an ending note: first write down exactly what you want to examine. Then, write down what you want to measure. Finally, use that to figure out what the best test is, based on what you can and can't measure with it."

I balance that with army pt every work day for a hour and a half.  We have 2 run days (6 mile run/ 3 mile pace run/ hill sprints), 2 days of circuit training (rowing, pullups, box jumps, kettle bell swings, and other workouts). We also do a day of yoga.

1. Fresh apples that have not been pasteurized are good. Sometimes you can find this at the store too, but check cider labels carefully. 
1. Heat the cider but do not boil? I was told any heat would make a lower quality cider. 

&gt; Pour a capful of bleach into the bucket, fill with water, and let it sit while you finish simmering your cider.

This doesn't say how much water to use so you really don't know if you added enough bleach to sterilize your equipment, which is critical. I used to write for Wikihow. The articles often miss important technical details. And people would often change my article details to basically break it. 

&gt; Empty the water, then rinse the bucket thoroughly with cold water. 

People often don't rinse because you can get bacteria from the water, or faucet itself. There's a reason why they use Star-San no rinse sanitizer. 

&gt; Let it ferment. Place the bucket in a cool, dark placeâaround 60Â° to 70Â°F (15Â° to 20Â°C). 

This is not accurate. The temperature very much depends on the yeast you use.

Which is why I have little respect for actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio, who keeps on playing with the same... skillset, shall we say? I don't know how to call it, the means of expression, the way you perform a role can vary. But for many actors it doesn't, while for Richard it does. Thorin gives us a lot of majesty, and a lot of Thorin-glares, there is a lot of anger bottled up in his voice that is decidedly Thorin's own and not Richard's.

He did say that after *The Hobbit* when he comes in for a casting, ""they thing the wrong guy came in."" So Thorin lives as a character, independently from the actor. Which is great."

He is a Mandalorian (they are very good fighters) and it's clear that he would be better than an average Jedi. 

To the Order 66 part. Even if the Jedi had a natural form of precognition to warn them from danger it doesn't bring much if you are both outnumbered and still surprised. Remember it doesn't tell them what is going to happen just that danger is coming (the ""I have a bad feeling about this"" thing). 

You see it clearly that before they were shot they noticed something. Ki Adi Mundi turned around before they shot him. Aylaa Secura also noticed it. But in that situation when you get confronted with something totally unexpected (you see there was never a reason to think even in the slightest bit that the clones would turn on them as well as they having befriended the clones) it is clear they couldn't react or at least couldn't react well enough. it was for them probably also a shock or a form of confusion and well one shot and you are dead.

NoseFetish,creepyPMs,1390569824.0,"Alright.

Imagine that you're a youngish guy, maybe late teens early twenties. You've been using corny pickup lines like this without positive results. When it doesn't work out you usually fall back on how being in love or smitten with them makes you not think properly, or even worse you blame it on having an erection or your penis.

Now imagine after getting turned down 10 times already today on OKcupid, and not receiving any responses to the copy pasted message you sent out to 100 women already today, you come to reddit and find this /r/creepyPM submission.

Finally! A place to air all your internal feelings that you're too cowardly or ashamed to show to others in real life, who would probably tell you to just change your tactics and use some self awareness. Because every other woman you've tried to get into an argument with on dating sites either shuts you down or doesn't respond, you take to the comment sections of /r/creepyPMs to defend the honor of this man, and in the same sentence, your own honor. In many ways the way some men treat women on reddit, it's like they're the face of every woman who has ever turned them down or not been receptive to them. You come up with absurd realities to suit your internal dialogue, to forego critically analyzing your own motives and intentions and why they're not working. Ideas like women only date assholes, women only date for money, women hold all the keys to sex, women don't really want nice guys, etc, etc. Anything to console your wounded ego, and put the blame anywhere else.

It's the gender reverse of what is known as a white knight. The idea that you would defend a stranger in hopes of developing a romantic connection, except in this instance it's usually someone of the same gender as you and not because you might develop any romantic connection, but to defend your ego because you identify with the dude in the message.

Ergo, this is just a 'nice guy' who was treated unfairly by another of the masses of 'meanie females' who should stop having any sort of preference and consider herself lucky enough to have such a gentleman message her and just go for the first guy who messages her, a stranger, with a corny pickup line and then saying it's love that made him do it. 

This is why we have to ban creep defending here. Most guys who obsessively use their time on the internet, usually don't have healthy views on women or their interactions with women. They blame everything on the women, never wanting to take personal responsibility for anything or any desire to want to change through being self critical. Too many young men on reddit who empathize more with what it's like to be the guy who got turned down, and not willing to empathize at all with what women might go through in online dating. It creates a feedback loop, other disgruntled disillusioned young men prop up this false reality along with you, and because you're trapped in this mythical world, both online and offline, it prevents you from making real world connections that would reveal a very different reality. Guys who see every woman who they come into contact with as friendzoning them, when they're the ones who are fuckzoning and romancezoning them without any regard for them as a person. "

Every single relationship I've had in the past failed because of things that could have easily been resolved just by talking about it.

askgeeves,AskWomen,1390569965.0,"They don't really actually refuse people abortions here anymore. I certainly haven't ever heard of that happening and something like that would be national news for sure (small country). It's more to make sure women are ok with their decision and are not being pressured or coerced into it. It's not like they are trying to convince you to not have an abortion, just that you are sure about your decision and have given it appropriate thought. (I should note that I am only familiar with the law here, not the procedure so am not sure exactly what they ask or how it is conducted.) It's reasonably debated here if this should still exist buy from a moral 'the inconvenience undermines women's rights' standpoint than a 'people who want one are being refused them' thing so isn't as prominent as other issues at the moment. 

You may only have to have 2 appointments depending on if your first doctor has a second representative for abortions in house. S/he also has to refer you to the remaining 1 or 2. Yeah, you may need an afternoon off work (depends on the employer how easy this is) but you could go during lunch or on weekends too.

Porn is a fantasy.  Some pornos go for the ""real"" fantasy, and some just blow it out of the water with the unrealistic fantasies.  Sometimes those fantasies can be very dirty, degrading things.  Sometimes we are only into those things for the time period we are going at it, and after the thrill dies down.  

So would you rather your b/f indulge these temporary fantasies with you and come to view you in a different light?  Or get them out of his system without feeling shamed after. 

I'm not saying this is the case 100% of the time.  And there are always those women who will indulge in those fantasies readily.  But for the most part, there are things that I find hot in a porn that I would never do with someone I cared about, unless they specifically asked me to try them.  "

Nausved,changemyview,1390570199.0,"&gt;You are viewing the conflict through the lens of today's politics. I would wager that there were just as many ""conservatives"" in the north as there were in the south during the 1800s.

Indeed, slavery and secession were both unpopular amongst white non-slaveholders in the antebellum South.

According to John Hill Aughey, a preacher from Mississippi in the 1860s: 

&gt;The question has been asked, is there any Union sentiment in the South? I reply that there is a strong Union sentiment, even in Mississippi. This sentiment is not found amongst the slaveholders, for, as a class, they are firmly united in their hostility to the Government. The middle and lower classes are not only opposed to secession, but also to slavery itself. Eleven years' association with the southern people has enabled me to form a correct opinion, and to know whereof I affirm. I make this statement without fear of successful contradiction, that the majority of the white inhabitants of the South are Union-loving men. The slaveholders have long ruled both the blacks and the whites in the South.

According to historian David Potter:

&gt;At no time during the winter of 1860-1861 was secession desired by a majority of the people of the slave states. . . . Furthermore, secession was not basically desired even by a majority in the lower South, and the secessionists succeeded less because of the intrinsic popularity of their program than because of the extreme skill with which they utilized an emergency psychology, the promptness by which they invoked unilateral action by individual states, and the firmness with which they refused to submit the question of secession to popular referenda.

hersinisterurge,raisedbynarcissists,1390570360.0,"In a perfect world, the sick things someone did to you should automatically cancel out everything else. 

In most cases the ""nice"" things were just part of the abuse, to lure you back in for more or maintain emotional control. These things are called small kindnesses. It's like when a someone is kidnapped and tortured and then their kidnapper feeds them, that simple act feels like a huge favor to the victim and an evidence of love, that's how Stockholm Syndrome happens. Repetitive trauma also fires off a chemical reaction in the body that causes rushes of oxytocin when the traumatic event ceases for the time being, which causes amnesia related to the event and euphoria related to the relief, and that makes these moments of kindness seem out-of-this-world wonderful to the victim, even though intellectually you know otherwise. Also, intermittent abuse mixed with small kindnesses is the worst kind because it builds something called a trauma bond. Your abuser is the only person that can ""rescue"" you from the abuse by giving you these breaks, so you develop a type of bond with them that's entirely unintentional on your part. This feeling you're experiencing is called cognitive dissonance, that's when you have two conflicting feelings or ideas at the same time. It's something that commonly happens to people when they feel helpless, it's a survival mechanism the brain employs to survive the abuse as it's happening, but it doesn't go away entirely once you escape the situation and you don't need it anymore. You need to separate the feelings that are reality based from the ones that have been instilled in you or born through the abuse, those are the dangerous ones that bring people back into their abusive situations. Abuse is far more devastating to the brain than most people think, neural pathways develop that cause us to experience a slightly altered version of reality in some cases, which may grant us the ability to forgive the unforgivable. This can be avoided if you identify these unhealthy feelings for what they actually are. Trust the inner voice that's trying to protect you."

Story time!  My husband just got back from a 7ms. long deployment.  It was our first deployment together and we're overseas so I was pretty much isolated from my support system.  The last two or three months were the most stressful and it was noticeably affecting my health.  I was constantly stressed, I had a breakdown at work because of the stress, was sick a lot when I only get sick once a year, depressed, always anxious, just a fucking shit storm really...  My husband would get angry with me when I wasn't at his beckon call (which entailed me sitting home on the computer waiting for him to get on), I went and helped out a friend who really needed help at the time instead of staying home and talking to him about nothing and he got pissed, upset that I was going out with gf's (I had finally made friends that I didn't work with).  We had a lengthy discussion about how unrealistic his expectations were of me during this deployment and I was suffering because of it.  I cut off myself from the world for about a week because I needed to, basically fell off the earth; didn't go to work (I volunteer full-time anyway, I do what I want), didn't talk to friends or family, and didn't talk to my husband.  I needed time to focus on my mental health before I ended up in inpatient mental health.  I spent so much time making sure I took care of him as much as I could and didn't go to him with my issues because I didn't want to add anymore stress than he already had and it was taking a toll on my health and our marriage.  You can't prioritize others over yourself, it just fucks shit up in the end."

All of this puts me in a incredibly awkward position in front of the people I'm supposed to learn from and the people I'm supposed to impress because they literally hold the future my career in their hands. It's stressful enough trying to keep all the anatomy and the steps of the surgery straight in my head. All I want to do is fit in and impress them and have them like me. Trying to figure out how to respond to crude sexual jokes without coming off as either slutty or a ball busting prude is just  too much when I'm going on, at most, five hours of sleep and little to no food.

Instead, all the values are added up first. In the case of Weakening curse into Heavenly agility without Asclepius built, it would be 100% (default) + (-100%) (WC) + 25% (HA) = 25%.

Obviously he must be a homosexual too, and a pedophile. Now that he's been raped, he's more likely to become a rapist himself.

I wish these weren't actual things I've heard, but they are. They blame the victim, making accusations that imply the victim wanted it and / or deserved it. What you're seeing is the weird feminist switch from supporting LGBT people and opposing rape to saying ""Raped in prison?! MUST BE A FAGGOT HAHAHAHA""

Here are my suggestions for a working system:

- I think starting a kick-vote should doom the game to a dodge, no matter the outcome.  If the vote passes, the target player receives the dodge penalty.  
If the vote fails, the player who initiated the vote dodges by default.

- The vote *must* pass with an overwhelming majority:  Only one vote is allowed to dissent (duo's counting as one).

- Vote Initiations should act like ARAM rerolls, max of 1/1, on a long recharge.  Say, once every 10th or 15th ranked game, with an indicator visible to the rest of your team.

&gt;Sorry, I don't get it. I'm saying that I wasn't taught to interpret my worth through what others said to me. I was bullied when I was a child. A lot. If I'd decided I needed external validation I wouldn't have had any self-worth.

Bully for you, but it's pretty much gospel fact that humans, as a deeply social species, depend greatly on inclusion, appreciation, and validation from other human beings in order to be psychologically healthy. The fact that you're a mutant who doesn't need other people doesn't change this fact.

&gt;anyone who lets others influence them against their will is a fragile and weak-willed person who ought to toughen up.

Ah, so if everyone you knew referred to you as ""Pussy Little Faggot Man"" and refused to talk to you other than to insult you and nobody would be your friend and people crossed the street when they saw you coming so they wouldn't have to be in any proximity to you, you should just like...man up and deal with it?

I mean, do we really need to talk about why ""man up and deal with it"" isn't a particularly healthy prescription for life?

&gt;Instead, when I tell you that I chose to be what I am, don't call me a liar.

Deeply deluded about established truths about human psychology? Yes. But I just don't have enough evidence to call you a liar.

&gt;Capitalism is the perfect example. You're never forced into any transaction. You can choose for yourself to reject the prices of the world and charge whatever you want for goods or services.

And when all food companies charge more for food than you make in a year, you can just choose to die of starvation, right? THAT'S TOTALLY A CHOICE YOU GUYS. I mean, those wimps in Sub-Saharan Africa should just BOOTSTRAP THEIR WAY OUT OF ABJECT POVERTY and MAN UP YOU GUYS.

I mean, are you aware of what happened in the first half of the last century? Are you aware of why we have anti-trust laws?

&gt;When was the last time you heard a person express agreement with any of these stereotypes to your face? There is a reason you consider them trite.

Uh, people have defended the stereotype that men are more physically aggressive on this very board.

Well and in some ways I would look at those events (Adam, Noah, the Law) more as promises of the future coming of Christ--all pointing to the same event, in other words--and just way that God continually reminded His people of the coming Messiah.  So I guess my question is, in a nutshell, what kind of ""grace"" was it being dispensed at those points and where does *that* theology come from?  I see the historical events and that God made covenants with His people in most/all of those moments, but I guess it all seems very continuous to me in other ways, and I don't see the nature of God's grace changing, either.

Edit: I guess what I am trying to pin down is if the difference is just syntax or if there's an actual theological distinction.  I mean if you change ""dispensation"" into ""covenant,"" do you end up with covenant theology?"

I.e. customer leases a car, a year into it they decide it's not working for them for some reason and want to trade out of it for something else. Except you can't exactly ""trade in"" a lease, you technically have to pay off the balance of the lease, buy the car for residual value, and then sign it over to the dealer. Dealerships can do this as part of the trade in/purchase process but sometimes it'll show up as a second owner- owner 1 is the leasing company, owner 2 is the customer, then it goes into dealer stock."

Targettio,Guildwars2,1390571330.0,"Getting exotic gear for PVE for a level 80 is about 20-30 gold (depending on class and what trinkets you want). Once you get to that point you can basically do any PVE content in the game. With the possible exception of high tier fractals which require agony resistance.

Until that point you can still do an awful lot of the content. Pretty much any open world bosses (Shatter, behemoth, fire elemental, fire shaman, golem etc etc) can be done at any level (as long as you are high enough for the zone) and with any gear. Most world bosses are completed constantly. There is normally a number of players waypointing all round the world going from spawn to spawn killing them. Find what is popping soon (using GW2stuff.net or something), meet the group and tag along. 

There are currently 3 world bosses that require more than just zerging (Marionette, Wurm and Teq), getting involved in these will probably mean joining guild run events. Some servers have a pre-planned times for each (and well organised servers kill him them every pop).

Dungeons can be run at the level they say, but the exportable modes will be hard. Most are best left until you hit 80. But you can probably run the low dungeons from 60+ if you have a few level 80s with you. 

Some people are picky about who they take on dungeon/fractal runs. But not many. Arguably for high level fractals you might need 1-2 players to be certain classes and use certain skills, but the rest of the team is normally open.

Those classes are still strong. Warrior is good in nearly all situations and give a lot of buffs with their shouts, so you may still see people ask for warrior heavy teams for quick clears. Guardian has certain skills which are really valuable in certain situations as well as providing high DPS. 

Nearly all classes have a place in WvW. Take whatever class you choose to WvW and you can be useful. Some are better at roaming solo, others stick in big groups.

So my friend works in a government building, in the same department as her mother (kind of, she is in the administration section, her mother is in the IT section), and the cleaners that work there are a bunch of shady people. 

Anyway, one day my friend's mother left an ipad on her desk and the next morning it was gone. But she wasn't completely sure that she left it there, and her boss agreed that she might have just misplaced it and forgot, it happens. So she let it go. But the day after that, she had left a phone on the same desk and was sure she left it there. The next morning it was gone. So she knew this time.

She told her bosses and my friend, and together they decided to set a couple of cameras up in the IT room, where the desk is. Then they left a box of 7 ipads still sealed in the packaging within view of the camera, as well as ipad keyboard cases, some high speed usb cables, and the charger for the phone that was stolen before.

And the dickhead stole it all. 

Not just 1 ipad or 1 usb cable, all of it, like nobody would notice 7 brand new ipads going missing.

One song doesn't lead into the next one the way Kid A does. There isn't as much of a conveyed meaning or emotional journey I get from that album.

So, i fell back on my work history (small parts manufacturing, which is the lowest of the low min wage jobs) and decided i wanted to take that to aeronautical engineering. So, i spent the money and got trained in CAD design, worked my ass off on my portfolio, and applied to every designer job i could find. I now work for a well known international company in their Engineering R&amp;D department making 55k with fantastic benefits. It's not the top paying in the field buf its the first step.  Changing fields takes sincere dedication. You have to pour everything you have into it. The week before i was offered the job my unemployment ran out and i wouldnt have made it to month's end. But that was the risk i took.  I saved for a year, quit my job, and went all in. Go talk to a recruiter that deals specifically with the field you want to get into.

Feelings are legitimate. Comparing your hurt feelings to the physical loss and injustices of others is completely bonkers."
screenmagnet,AskReddit,1390572279.0,"Pharmacist. Maybe it's just where I live, but the pharmacists seem to know very little and do even less. They either get annoyed when I have questions, try to tell me that my meds are dangerous/wrong for me and that my doctor is an idiot, or if I ask them even simple questions they don't know the answer. I have even run into some that have suggested homeopathic remedies!

They also tend to play fast and loose with patient privacy. You can call any pharmacy,  pretend you are calling from a hospital, and they will just fax over the list of meds for any customer in their database. They don't even try to verify your identity on the phone. You could be literally anyone. Same thing with picking up meds. They don't ask for ID. Even with controlled substances it is hit and miss. And they advance you pills or fill your prescription early or do substitutions even when they are not authorized to. Which is super convenient for me, but ultimately against the law. Some of the don't even KNOW the laws that govern their own profession when you ask them.

I have met some decent pharmacists over the years, but they were either clinical pharmacists working out of a hospital or old school compounding pharmacists. The younger ones, IME, don't know shit, although many are super nice and helpful.

Also: all chiropractors (don't get me started), most physiotherapists (the ones who work from private clinics, not the ones who work at hospitals or nursing homes), many clinical psychologists, many optometrists and dentists (again, play fast and loose with patient safety and cut corners for profit), and almost all alternative health care practitioners (I have met the odd naturopath that wasn't a quack and actually helped their patients, but they are unfortunately drowned out by the scads of their peers that sell dangerous treatments and convince their patients to abandon medical treatment).

Underpaid: NURSES. Holy hell, are they underappreciated!"

That's right. So I hope you're letting your councilor know that you want to pay more property taxes to get better transit, and your MPP that the province needs to step up.

&gt; I'd love for things to be: more rides means more money, but it just doesn't work that way. 

Right. Because if it did, it'd be making a profit. Which should not be the point of transit.

&gt; That's why fares go up despite record ridership. But what do I know, right?

Fares also go up because the average fare per ride continues to drop. That is, more people are using passes for trips instead of tickets and tokens, which means less revenue coming in for the same amount of trips."

&gt; The issue of rape in prison may be also much more important in the US,

I can't seem to find great historical graphs on this, but prisoner stories keep saying that rape in uS prisons is less of a problem because homosexuality is more accepted. But there are a few US federal prisons that are extremely violent. 

Also: 

* [Some graphs on US prison system statistics](http://prospect.org/article/six-charts-explain-why-our-prison-system-so-insane) including violent crime rate, incarceration rate, local, state and federal prison populations over time, state prisoners by race and offense. 
* [Human Rights Watch Prison Rape Report](http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2001/prison/report.html), with case histories, example stories from prisoners. 
* [Rape Factories](http://reason.com/archives/2011/06/20/rape-factories). ""Contrary to popular belief, most of the perpetrators were not other prisoners but staff members...""
* [The US Prison Rape Elimination Act Regulatory Impact Assessment](http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/programs/pdfs/prea_ria.pdf) talks about how hard it is to get reliable data about prison rapes. 
* [Allegations  of ""sexual victimization"" in US prisons rose from 2009-2011.](http://www.ojp.gov/newsroom/pressreleases/2014/ojppr012314.pdf)
* Possible source of historical data from [2007-2012 from BJS](http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&amp;iid=278). But it's divided into males and females. Some assembly required. 
* And if you want some (sad) humor, you have the [GOP Rainbow of Flavors Rape Chart](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/24/1149395/-GOP-Rape-Advisory-Chart-h-t-to-connecticutie). Just... I don't even know.  

&gt;  It is also mentioned that punishment seeking is a part of constructing a boy's identity.

Does the report mean boys intentionally seek to be punished? Or they happen to be more rowdy by nature, and get more punishment as a result? Because me and most of my friends wanted adventure, not punishment, and sometimes we pushed the boundaries.

By my count you're a 32D UK sizing (Yes I'm serious) You might be happier in your sister size of 34B/C(depends on the bra). I know that 34's seem a bit tight, but that's likely because some of the breast tissue is hanging out on the band and NOT in the cup (very common!). 

I calculated this size as every inch from your band size to your bust size is one cup size. so

32=Band size

33=A

34=B

35=C

36=D 

Based on the fact that 3,4,5 measurements are the same you have very shallow breasts (Common in trans women) so buying bras you need to look for ones designed for shallow breasts! 

Try this resource: http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/shallow  they know all about fitting you into a better bra! (Sorry I'm a 36J so my shallow help is nada). Also the girls at /r/ABraThatFits can be helpful in suggesting brands. 

In going forward you're going to want to search for a Plastic that is realistic with you. Remember your band size DOES NOT change so if he says ""You'll be a 38DD when I'm done"" remember that's really a 34G or higher. 

Don't ask me why, bras are really stupid and until bit named department stores learn how to actually fit women properly (almost none of them do!) most women are going to be walking around with the wrong size bra! "

&gt;To compare their results to those for earlier decades, the authors noted that a previous study of children born from 1952 to 1975 â by Chul-In Lee and Gary Solon â found broadly similar and steady levels of mobility. Taken together, the studies suggest that rates of intergenerational mobility appeared to have held roughly steady over the last half-century, Mr. Chetty said.

&gt;Another earlier study â of the late 19th century, by Joseph P. Ferrie â suggested that mobility was higher then in the United States than in England, Mr. Autor noted. **Sometime after the 1920s, though, social mobility in the United States appeared to have declined, the Ferrie study found.**

I hid my relationship for 1.5 years because:


1) If they find out ... EVERYONE will find out ... and I have a big ass family that will always talk about it and ask for photos and probably his life story.  First thing they'll ask is what does he do and what school he went to.  He will always be on their mind as much as he is on my mind.


2) Immediate family would want to meet him asap.  Book a dinner or cook a dinner... but i know it's going to be an interrogation and quite honestly, it wasn't something to prepare for... it's just an intimidating experience.


3)  I have to be sure that he's sticking around... to me, a good year or so would confirm that he's a pass and can meet the parents because again... once I do that... step 1&amp;2  is enough to cause me huge anxiety if things don't work out shortly after..."

askgeeves,AskWomen,1390573340.0,"I'm a girl who also naturally wants to offer solutions when people vent to me but I also need to vent myself sometimes.

The thing about venting is it isn't all 'men are mars, women are from Venus'. As a natural problem solver I don't take too well to people trying to fix my problems for me as it feels like they think I can't handle it myself. I like to think of it as a matter of  independence but the truth is it's probably closer to youthful arrogance at times. I just like to fix my things by myself (classic engineering mindset).  A lot of guys who post these sorts of questions say that they have a need to be the problem solver and find that difficult to overcome, etc etc. but women have that need too.  I'm usually pretty surprised that lots of these posters can't grasp why people would take poorly to advice offerings as I imagine they'd feel the same hurt pride as I do. 

The emotional venting thing is just an outlet. I've usually thought these things through every way possible before I even consider venting to someone. At that stage what I really *want* is affirmation that my feelings are justified. I'm all for someone, with a reasonable argument, to tell me why my feeling are not justified (as if I'm 100% certain they are I wouldn't be venting).

Sometimes I do swallow my pride and ask for help which is usually a pretty emotional thing for me. But I'll ask, and importantly i'll ask for suggestions as a way to help me think through this difficult situation,  not a step by step playbook.

TL;DR ""we're not so different, you and I"". I try to fix my own problems and keep my pride. "

This is similar to why people with bullet fragments in their bodies (from old, healed gunshots) don't get lead poisoning from that. 

A colloid, by the way, is when you have a liquid that has particles of solid matter suspended inside it.  Familiar colloids include milk (milkfat droplets suspended in a watery liquid) and paint (latex or oil droplets suspended in a solvent liquid).

Either way, you've lost $5,000, but you didn't have to come up with that $2,000 in cash. 


Additionally, since it offsets against your taxable income, if you make an amount right around a tax bracket cutoff, and your capital loss exceeds the difference, you may be able to put yourself in a lower tax bracket. So you lose $2,000 but save $4,000 in taxes.

Like, she originally conceived of the pun when she was like 14, and decided that she was going to follow through with it.  Luckily, her name was Anna, so she just started spelling it differently, and started early so that everyone would be used to it by the time she implemented things.  And so, newly rechristened Ana, she went about her days doing everything she could to reach a successful position in life so that she knew she would be able to afford a Lexus.  And then she looked around at all the different models until she found the one where the spare tire covered up the ""us"" in ""Lexus.""  And at that moment, she knew the purpose she had set herself out to fulfill, had finally come to fruition.

She would only have been partially foiled in her plans if Alberta had for some reason decided to allow punctuation on license plates.  Pretty sure that ANA'S LEX looks pretty close to ANASLEX when you're just glancing at it."

At first glance I thought it was a misshapen big bird stuffed animal.  I grabbed it.  It was soft, and cozy, despite its ugliness, and I looked up at him so confused... like... what does this mean?  He then said to me ""I made it for you.""

This man does not sew, or craft of any kind.  His hand writing looks like chicken scratch.  He at times can have an anxious personality, and can at times find my family intimidating.  He told me that while I was away at college, he went to my parents' house and asked my mother to teach him to sew.  He then sewed it, and told me he tried to find all of the softest, coziest materials for me.  I broke down, and hugged that pillow so hard and buried my face into it, and cried hard for several minutes.

TrekkieTechie,AskReddit,1390573706.0,"TL;DR: I missed my last opportunity to see my father alive and awake.

Three years ago my father passed away. In the months leading up to his death he had been struggling with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (his lungs were turning to scar tissue and no one knew why), and had been working with Duke Medical Center exploring the possibility of a lung transplant. He had just returned home from a multi-day battery of tests and examinations there and was feeling pretty good about his chances, when he fell ill with what appeared to be pneumonia and was hospitalized. He was having difficulty breathing (well, more than usual) so he was put on a ventilator. Very late the previous night I had returned to my own home (about an hour from the hospital) after a long car trip and was still tired from the journey when I received a call from my mother explaining the situation. We agreed I'd visit the next day, when they had more information on his condition and he'd had a chance to settle in.

That evening his doctors decided to put him into (what was meant to be) a temporary drug-induced coma; he was fighting the ventilator and in a lot of pain, and putting him under would give his body a chance to rest and hopefully heal as the machine did his breathing for him. A few days later he was airlifted from the local hospital back to Duke Medical, where he was reevaluated as a transplant candidate. His application was rejected because his condition had deteriorated so far that the transplant board didn't believe he'd be able to survive the procedure or the months of rehabilitation that would follow. We made the decision to put him out of his misery and take him off life support, and my mother and brother and I watched him pass away. Our decision ended up being validated by how quickly his body gave out; it took less than five minutes for him to go. The staff didn't even have time to bring us snacks. (Did you know that hospitals provide cookies, crackers, soda, etc. to the families of patients waiting to die? I didn't. We thought it was kind of funny, even at the time, but the nurses explained it usually took hours for someone to pass on after life support was shut off, and those waiting usually got hungry.)

Two things bothered me about the manner of his passing. One was personal, and what I consider my greatest regret even though I strive to live a life free of them: I didn't make the effort to go visit him the day he was hospitalized. I hadn't known it at the time, of course -- no one did -- but it would have been my last chance to speak to him. The second was a sort of outrage on his behalf: he had been full of hope about getting his disease permanently managed and returning to some semblance of a normal life, but he got sick; then he was put under with the assurance it was just temporary, and he'd be woken back up in a few days -- I took lots of pictures of him getting wheeled out and loaded into the chopper, to show him the adventure he'd been on without knowing once he woke back up -- but he never woke back up. It hurt that I didn't get to say goodbye, but it hurt much more that he didn't get to say his goodbyes, to anyone. It took me a long time to get over that.

That night, after his body was taken away for cremation, my now-smaller family returned to our nearby hotel suite and I slept on the sofa in the main room, letting my mother and younger brother take the bed. In my dreams -- and I rarely dream -- there had been some kind of mistake; my father came to the door of our hotel room and laughed at how inept the hospital had been, mixing him up with someone else, now go help your mother pack so we can go home. I woke up and stared at the ceiling of the hotel room and everything felt wrong for a while, until I was able to sort out the difference between dream and reality once more."

For example a rational person might look into their options, talk to their doctors, investigate overseas solutions. Someone with tokophobia is likely to self harm or have a breakdown.

As a personal example, I have a mild case of tokophobia, I recently started lactating for no good reason, No fear of pregnancy whatsoever, this is about my breasts. I am fighting urges all day long to stop myself self harming my breasts. I see an object, the back of my mind is trying to work out how I can use it to cut my breasts off.  My breasts are betraying me, they are no longer part of me. I constantly find myself scratching them, I wear oven mits to bed now. I'm on the verge of tears and every time I feel them so much as tickle, I just break down. I had a screaming fit the other day when my partner tried to hug me because he touched my breasts.

This might sound odd to you, but the best way of dealing with your height is by consciously viewing it as a weakness. Use your height as a motivation to propel you towards alphaness. Yes, forget all that bullshit about ""height doesn't matter"". It does. Every guy would prefer to be somewhere around 6'4"". Fuck people who try to console you about a weakness of yours by saying ""Ohh don't worry, nobody cares about ______. It doesn't matter. What matters is your personality."" Fuck that. Being short **IS** a weakness. Being ugly **IS** a weakness. Having one arm **IS** a weakness, etc.

The best policy is being completely aware of your weakness, **and neither under-emphasizing nor overemphasizing it.** Do not view your height as a debilitating weakness that will prevent you from ever succeeding in the world. That's false, because that's being too negative. But also do not view your height as an irrelevant factor, or that short is better (lol). That's also false, because that's being too positive. Rather, view it exactly as it is: A moderate weakness which gives you an immediate disadvantage when people meet you for the first time, but can be overcome by having strengths in other areas.

If you realize this, you will actually put in the work to improve yourself in all the areas you *can* control, because you realize that you need to do all you can to elevate your value (just like every man does, but most of them don't realize it so they never improve). Once you've made this realization and you've really committed to being your best self, then you'll be so far ahead of most guys that girls will **PREFER** you over many tall guys. But you have to put in the work to get the results you want. If you sit around doing nothing, bitching about your height, you will be destined for chumpitude.

Listen to my advice and you'll become an alpha despite your height."

By legal definition in the US (and every other rational sense of the word), he raped you. 


For ALL of that to go down and have him not come to you on his own accord is NOT okay. My guess would be that he wants to make the situation go away, and not bringing it up means that you might not get mad or upset or start crying, which he wants to avoid starting (he may deal with it well when you are in that state, but that's irrelevant).

So there you go, playing jesus mode traying to smell all the flowers while you'r at it. And the story...just wasnt that good. Some people argue that this thing encourages to replay the game killing or not killing, or maybe just being in the middle, but men fuck that thing! You only make that type of story telling when you make the player decide certain choices in the main story, not every fucking time you need to kill a guard. You crippled the player with that moronic gameplay.
Of course the graphics where nice, and the visual art style too, and all the game mechanics worked fine, but i just couldn't find myself enjoying something that restricts me that much. For me it was just a terrible game, it could have been awesome.

2. I cannot support the legalization of so-called ""recreational"" marijuana.

So, that's about a decade later.. and that's the official planning what *should* happen. And it's just start of operations. After this the DEMO reactor will have to be built, and if that works, then you still need to roll out a massive building program, assuming it's all doable at a reasonable cost in reasonable timeframe. It's all a moot point if it costs ten times as much as a coal plant for 150% of the power.

[Johnston is best known for performing a barnstormer-style barrel-roll maneuver with Boeing's pioneering 367-80 jet in a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside of Seattle, on August 7, 1955.[5] The maneuver was caught on film and was frequently shown on the Discovery Wings cable channel in a three-minute short as part of the Touched by History series, while the channel still aired. Called before then-president of Boeing, Bill Allen, for rolling the airplane, Johnston was asked what he thought he was doing, and responded with ""I was selling airplanes"". He kept his position as a test pilot, and got in no legal troubles for his actions. Along with his cowboy style of dress, such maverick behavior is said to have inspired the creation of Dr. Strangelove's Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong character, who, in rodeo style, rode a balky nuclear weapon to its target.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_M._Johnston)

Ostrololo,worldnews,1390574559.0,"Your fourth point is nonsense. Take cochlear implants, for example. The surgery is somewhat invasive and carries risks, yet it's certainly not necessary. A deaf child can easily grow up happy and can later decide when she's older whether or not to have the implant. Yet here in the Western world it's considered perfectly acceptable for parents to subject their children to the procedure.

EDIT: I will copy what I said since the downvotes have begun:

&gt; I'm fully aware they have advantages. I'm arguing they aren't necessary. In fact, many members of the deaf community argue children shouldn't get cochlear implants, since there's nothing wrong with a child being deaf. /u/Denmark1976 is arguing that performing a procedure on a child that isn't necessary is immoral, always, full stop. Please understand: something being advantageous doesn't mean it's necessary.

I'm arguing against the claim ""unnecessary medical procedures should not be performed on kids"". I'm not arguing the consequences of circumcision or the advantages of not being deaf, but rather providing a counterexample where an unnecessary procedure is acceptable.

**What I'm not arguing for:** ""It's ok for children to get cochlear implants, therefore it's okay for parents to circumcise their children."" Reading comprehension, please. "

But you want to know my real thoughts on why most men don't attract women, when women do attract men (whether they want to or not)? Because men don't generally try. Look at the men you know. Most of them need a better haircut, and clothes that fit. Women have more varied wardrobes, and nice hair, and can use makeup to cover flaws if they want to. Are you really trying to blame nature for women seeming more attractive, when societally speaking, women are the only ones who are allowed to make themselves more attractive?"

Theungry,nfl,1390574696.0,"There were so many bad picks in Patriots history.  Kenneth Sims stands out objectively because he was a #1 overall pick DE, who was just dreadful.  He did nothing on the field, and he had drug problems to boot.  He was drafted a couple years before I started going tog ames though, so he doesn't come first to my mind.

I usually think of Eugene Chung.  The first time I remember paying attention to the draft, the Pats took Chung, who was expected to be a beast on the O-line.  He was the kind of O-lineman that only got starts because of his draft status, and quickly played his way out of the starting line-up instead.

Chris Canty, CB also comes to mind frequently when I see a CB get targeted repeatedly in any football game.  A three-toed sloth could run a successful 15 yard comeback route against Chris Canty in his prime."

MarcRoflZ,summonerschool,1390574766.0,"Psychiatry student here. Anxiety disorders, depending on which ofc, are interesting in how they affect our performance and what we take from a situation. Without knowing your specific situation or anything like that i can give you some general tips to help curb your anxiety when it comes to ranks.  
  
1. First and foremost, i would like you to do something. Get a piece of paper and write a few things down for yourself. Write down when you started playing LoL, why you started playing it, and what has kept you around this long. I hope with this you find a reason (a core reason) why you like this game. Sometimes going back to your roots of a habit (ie. pleasure, fixation, escape) often help us focus and remember what it is we find fun about it. Then next time your playing, try and remember these reasons and fixate on them. See if that helps at all?
  
2. There have been a few recent studies, that I'm a bit lazy to pull up links for but I'm sure you can google if you're really interested, that have been done on the effects of ""tricking your mind"". Even the simple act of smiling can increase the amount of positivity your body will create for you. This being said, in the realm of anxiousness before you go into a game, while its loading, get out of your chair, stand in front of your computer in a confident stance. (ie. putting your hands behind your head, or putting your hands on your desk and leaning forward, etc etc.) In a study children that were told to do this before taking an exam preformed better than children that were told to go in and sit at their desk before the test started.  
  
3. At the end of the day you have to remember that League of Legends is a game. You're feeling this anxiety, or fear, because your brain is afraid of dropping a rank, or losing elo. While fear and anxiety can be crippling, my best advice to you is if you play a ranked game that goes horribly and you feel like your anxiety is setting in, turn the game off. Instead watch a funny movie, or play a single player game (if that relaxes you) put the power of relaxation and happiness into your own hands for a bit and when you feel soothed or a little more relaxed then you can turn the game back on again.  
  
Hope you can take something from this. Good luck out there buddy!"

Laugarhraun,OnePiece,1390574927.0,"I think so. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is a great and wonderful manga that has inspired lots of this generation mangas (esp. Shaman King, HxH, One Piece I'd say). It was itself heavily influenced by superheroes comics.

I think that in a cover of a tome of the manga, Oda said his admiration for Jojo's author Hirohiko Araki.

One small reference: the [Joestar birthmark](http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Joestar_Birthmark) is on [the shoulder of a level 6 Impel Down prisoner](http://www.mangapanda.com/103-2638-6/one-piece/chapter-531.html). Recently, Bobby funk punches on Boo are very Jojo's-y (""ORAORAORAORA"").

In Jojo's people have *stands* and Devil Fruits especially the paramecia ones can be really close to it. For example One Piece Mr5's power is very close to a Jojo's stand. I'm pretty sure there's a bunch of them but it must be 10 years+ since I last read a Jojo's tome.

If you want to read it (which is a suuuper idea) I'd advise you to start with part 3: [Stardust Crusaders](http://www.mangapanda.com/jojos-bizarre-adventure-part-3-stardust-crusaders). It's easier to get hooked with this one than with part 1 and 2 (but you'll miss cyborg nazis though)."

Here's my two cents regarding communication: Don't even think about when you'll hear from him or be able to talk to him. I know some people think that may be harsh, but this question is asked daily and it really is such a non-issue in the scheme of things. 

Your boyfriend/fiance/husband is going to military training that will break him down physically, mentally, and emotionally. The last thing he needs is us worrying about when we'll hear from them. What they need is our letters, particularly supportive ones that tell them what we've been up to so that they feel like they're still being included and so that they know we haven't turned into an emotional blubbering mess without them (even if we have). 

Much like many people here, I held tight to my phone and checked the mailbox 5 times a day after he left. At some point during his training I stopped compulsively checking for messages or letters and focused on keeping myself busy and writing to him to tell him what I had been doing and what we would do when he returned home.

869689698,worldnews,1390575044.0,"Adults are required to get a full circumcision when they convert if they didn't receive one as a baby.  This law would criminalize a traditional and harmless practice that has gone on uninterrupted for thousands of years.  Jews and Muslims would be forced to leave or at least have their culture criminalized.  I think this is a case of European secular culture becoming dogmatic and institutionalized at the expense of empathy, dialogue and cultural understanding.  If you want to know why a country does something, you can't just look at the surface of the issue.  Ask, who benefits?  Who benefits from kicking out Jews and Muslims?  It may sound like exaggeration but I believe this law would be an attempt at politically correct ethnic cleansing."

I stand corrected, it never made it to market: ""Despite decades of research on male contraceptives, no treatment has moved past clinical trials to reach the market."" I think it was the men in the human trials just didn't like that version of the pill, or something. It was something related to their preference. 
http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/i39/Hunt-Male-Contraceptive-Pill-Continues.html

Same article, maybe I'm thinking of this: ""During the early 2000s, there was a lot of excitement in the male contraceptive field, says Douglas S. Colvard, the deputy director of programs at CONRAD, a nonprofit organization that works on reproductive health research. In 2002, two pharmaceutical companies, Schering and Organon, teamed up to work on a hormonal method similar to the one women use. But the collaboration was short-lived; it ended in 2006 because Schering thought that the required multiple injections would deter men from using the method. ""

Relationships that come from friendships have a much higher chance of succeeding. The risk is losing a friend and a partner if it doesn't work out whereas asking someone you don't really know out is much less risky because the friendship isn't really there to lose yet which is why that seems to be one of the more prevalent dating methods as it is quick and lower risk despite the lower chance of success.

So, just try see how you go as friends and if all goes well you'll naturally get closer and maybe she'll end up showing signs she's interested or an opportune moment will arise for you to make a move, either way there's no need to rush into it now."

All my humour is highly reactional, very deadpan and often easy to miss in double entendre, etc. This means my ""delivery"" of jokes is more of a deliberate non-delivery and people may not even register it as a joke or hear my interjection (I say them for myself anyway). This results in a fairly poor response rate but when they do catch my jokes they are 98% well received and there are never any chirping cricket noises after a delivery. It also means my stuff never gets stolen like you mentioned. (And luckily my humour works with my resting bitch face syndrome.)

Online I have a weirdly good response rate but that might be more a reflection of the state of social media. Same kinda understated humour style though which people tend to respond well too rather than the shove it down their throats/pause for roaring applause styles.

My dear, you have a problem, yes it is your fault.  BUT, there are ways to fix it.  As /u/mccamel said, Bulletproof coffee is a great energy booster.  But, did you also know that MCT (medium chain triglycerides) satiate your appetite?  I have a cup of this every morning, and don't feel the need to eat again for around 8 hours.  This is a /r/keto thing.  That community has helped me realize that you can lose weight and still eat the things you love.

Carbs.  That is problem #1.  Carbs are comfort food.  They make us feel safe, and warm, and complacent.  THERE is the problem.  COMPLACENCY.  You sound like a very intelligent and beautiful woman, why would YOU of all people get complacent?  I'm guessing, and correct me if I'm wrong, that your husband would help you if you only asked.

Shame is a powerful thing.  It can set us deep in a hole, or it can be incredible motivation.  I was once shameful too.  I weighed 300 pounds at my peak.  Now, I know that doesn't sound like an incredible amount, but do you know how much stress 300 pounds puts on the human body?  Joints, organs, muscles, connecting tissue, YOUR BRAIN.  300 pounds was shameful to me.  But I took that shame, and turned it into motivation.  I now work out regularly, and eat right.

You need to realize that this is a problem.  You also need to realize that YOU are the one who needs to initiate change.  Talk to your husband, let him know how you feel about yourself.  He married you and promised to be with you through sickness and in health.  Well, this is sickness.  I'm 100% positive that he would be there for you, to continue to push you, to motivate you, to remind you that this doesn't have to be your lot in life.

Head over to the keto subreddit, and see what there is for you.  I've seen people drop from 500 pounds, to 250 in a matter of months...MONTHS.

I really hope that you can push yourself to start feeling better.

If you have any questions, PM me.  Or PM one of the other fine folks here.  We're all here for eachother, as friends, as confidants, as warriors in the same battle.  Sister, we feel your pain.
