thewreckage,AskReddit,1390433650.0,"As far as real life advice goes, if you're both willing it should work out. Keep communication open, and be patient but clear about your expectations of the relationship. What do you expect of a partner that you don't expect of a friend? Do his long-term and short-term goals work with yours (eg: it's totally fine wanting to get married and have kids in the next few years while your close friend backpacks around the world. Significantly harder if it's your partner.). 

Anecdotally, my dude and I transitioned from best friends to fwb to the boyfriend/girlfriend thing, and we've been going strong as a couple for 3+ years now. There are differences, our optimal timelines are a few years off from one another, but we'll meet in the middle, I love travel and he dislikes it, but I like travelling alone and he doesn't mind waiting for me. We have the same communication style and the same way of working out a relationship problem (there are fighters, there are hash-out-ers, and there are let-it-go-problem avoiders, all are valid as long as your partner gets your style. A fighter's going to scare an avoider and frustrate a talker, an avoider is going to worry a talker and annoy a fighter and a talker is going to bore fighters and avoiders. That's my redneck version of a real social science paper that was published a few years ago...)

Anyway, with a close friend the easy relationship stuff, like getting along and matching values, comes easy, cause it's already there. The boring stuff, like problem solving and defining expectations doesn't always come naturally."

Depriving your child of the opportunities to make friends with peers in my opinion is one of the worse things any parent could do.

I'm not sure if you meant to imply that homeschooling = overprotecting/depriving your children, but that's pretty far from true about homeschooling in general. I was homeschooled and it was a great experience. I made friends who I still keep in contact with today.

I knew other homeschoolers who were a lot more social than me, but I just wasn't comfortable with people (and I went to public school and private school as well, so I can safely say I knew which environment I liked best).

That said, homeschooling absolutely can leads an abusive environment, but homeschooling is not inherently abusive (I know you weren't arguing that it was, just pointing out how some people do think that - I just wanted to put in my own two cents)."

I think it is not okay to promote an *unhealthy* standard of beauty, because that drives girls to think that no matter how much they diet, they are overweight. It is possible to look at a person and see if they are underweight, to a degree. And being underweight is unhealthy, it can cause a lot of problems that I have dealt with firsthand. 

With the other end of the spectrum there is a lot more lee-way, some people can be perfectly healthy while being X amount of lb over what is considered ""healthy"" by BMI, and others can have weight-related heart or joint problems when they are just barely above average. It is all individual. However, being medically *underweight* is pretty bad for you across the board. It's extremely hard on your heart, digestive system, reproductive organs, bones, everything. It's generally pretty obvious if someone is underweight, and most models in the industry are.

""Looking healthy"" is a huge category that includes women that are naturally thin, naturally curvy, overweight and everything in between. Glowing skin, condition of hair and nails, weight, odor, all of these things are indicators of health.


So yeah, to a degree you can estimate a person's health by their appearance."

Reading a lot of the posts on /r/asianamerican regarding users who have trouble dealing with being a literal minority really sunk in. I never really understood what they were trying to convey and occasionally, maybe thought that person was just being weak.  It was quite the eye opener for me. More power to you kids in white land.

On the lighter side, as I was in a long line of urinals, drunk off my ass, doing my business, one dude made some joke about small dicks/being Asian (he didn't know I was in there as I was probably 10 urinals down). I yelled out, ""Hey! Look at my eyes! That shit ain't funny!"" (not in an angry tone...more jokingly calling out his bullshit) and everyone had a hearty laugh. The guy did apologize. At the sinks...not while I was still at the urinal.

It would be like any other sexual preference - maybe someone is into BDSM or something like that, and if your partner can't satisfy that, then why be with them?  That's just silly, you need to be compatible.  

&gt; Essentially the reason this is pissing people off is that it's discrimination based on something that can't be helped

Whoa, are you serious?  Discrimination?  That's taking this a bit far, don't you think?  What about the wheelchair example?  Honestly asking, answer that one.  If someone was into very physical activities that require legs in some capacity and therefore the individual without legs wasn't able to share those activities with them, would they be such an asshole for looking for other partners?

&gt;How would you feel if the person you thought you might just have a future with dumps you because you can't use birth control?

By the time he likely has this talk, if she's so broken that it tears her apart, then she gets attached WAY too fast, and that's not OP's responsibility.

by_a_pyre_light,wiiu,1390434698.0,"I agree that the idea of Nintendo putting new products on mobile is financially untenable for them, but I don't see any issue with doing quality, official ports of old games, where power is obviously of no concern and the IPs are languishing, not making any money right now. It can be done right, and well. Look at the various GTA games that have come out on mobile. That's how you do it. 

I *do* think that Nintendo either needs to accept the Wii as a fluke of being in the right place at the right time, and either move back to making a compelling competing device, or they need to try something else. Whether that something else is accepting second console status and making their products substantially cheaper than the competition to the point that it's a no brainer to pick them up as secondary consoles, or if the other option is to get out of the hardware business all together and license games on MS and Sony hardware, I don't know. I'd be happy with either solution. 

I *strongly* considered the possibility of just getting a Nintendo device this generation, even after my disappointment with the lame Wii, because of Nintendo's commitment to bringing in third party games. 

""Finally"", I thought, ""a single console to play *all* the games."" 

Even the tablet held some promise when I saw the ZombieU game demo.

Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed by the specs. I knew those couldn't be ""next gen"", not compared to what Sony and MS would do, to say nothing of what my PC could do. I knew, then, that Nintendo would have a hard time getting 3rd party games running on the hardware. That pretty much sealed the deal for me- too expensive to be a secondary system, with no compelling games, and as I have no toes to Nintendo franchise's aside from Smash Bros, no reason to buy it on its own. 

I know I'm not alone in this, and I wish Nintendo would finally put put something for people like me.  "

wordserious,AskReddit,1390434770.0,"You and I have a different set of beliefs. I agree that money is an important part of a career decision, but it is not the only part, and not even the most important part.

I believe that society needs people working on all sorts of things, not just those that happen to have monetary value at any particular moment. We need people working on art, on poetry analysis, on ethics, on philosophy, on the customs of women's shoemakers of the seventeenth century. We need these people just as much as we need marketers, business majors, web designers, engineers, and all other careers that happen to pay well at this moment.

Moreover, we need good people, knowledgeable people, educated people doing those things. We need all of this because all knowledge is relevant. We also need all of these because the role of society is more than simply feed and shelter people, things that cost resources and cost money.

I believe that the best way to implement this would be to make college free to every person who has the ability, talent, and discipline to attend one. The cost should be payed by all tax payers, because all of society benefits from educated people doing what they love, ""pursuing their dreams,"" as you put it.

I agree with you that there is a problem with the way we fund higher education in this country; but I believe that the solution is more subsidy, not less.

I also believe that people should optimize their happiness, and that earning money to be able to pay your way through life is a necessary chore, but not the defining factor. So I do want people to make informed decisions about money, *after* they made informed decisions about what they want to do with the precious little time they get to live a life."

Additionally, if you complete GE courses for the JC, most will offer an Associates degree in mechanics.

fractalica,AskWomen,1390435005.0,"I wax my arms! My arms are super hairy. As in, man arms hairy. I usually just let it be and don't even think much about it. But sometimes when I want to get it off I get them waxed. 

I'm not gonna lie, it hurts a lot! I think that at some point of my life I've gotten everything waxed and arms are around 2nd or 3rd place in pain. Now, I don't know if you usually wax, but the good thing is that the pains lasts for the first couple of times they remove the wax and then you get used to it. 

At least for me, the hair grows back suuuper slow. I usually wax mine in summertime because I like to get a nice tan and it lasts around a month or month and a half (this is much longer than, for example, my leg hair takes to grow). The growing stage is really.. discreete, I don't know if that's the exact word but it's not really that noticeable at all, and its slow. At least in my case it doesn't grow back ""all at once""... it's like hairs start slowly showing up, individually... maybe that's also what makes it seems like it lasts longer than other waxed body parts :P

I would really suggest waxing if you really want to get rid of your arm hair. I wouldn't EVER think about shaving, maybe it works for some people but in my case my hair is thick so I don't even want to try.

Good luck! And remember you only have to do this because **you** want to, not because of what someone thinks. I wax my arms because I want to, and sometimes I leave them hairy for months because I want to. Just make sure that you're doing this for you :)"

ptam,AskReddit,1390435023.0,"Diagrams, Visualize everything. No textbooks are the same; just as one teacher may be ineffective, a textbook may not teach something very well. 

Go to the library, get all the texts you can on your topic, read or skim them, peruse the most well explained one, the one that helps YOU learn the material, then start taking your own notes. Think of it as a test to teach yourself the subject. Write it down in a way that makes sense to you, with diagrams and arrows and outlines to connect concepts and topics. Work hard on this seemingly trivial part. Once you start to complete it, refer back to it for review. You've just simultaneously taught yourself the subject while essentially writing your own personalized textbook.

Now you don't need the book, just your notes. Start to do problems in your head, only writing down what you absolutely need to keep track of. Go through the process for examples mentally, as much as you can. Then start doing the same with absolutely as few peeks at your notes as possible.

TLDR: Multiple texts to find different ways to learn subject, make your own comprehensive notes, use your own visual aids and diagrams to both learn and use as future reference."

I am not exactly sure what your definition of capitalism is, but trade is not a function of the state it is the opposite: a voluntary exchange. Adding a medium of exchange does not require force and increases efficiency. Trading time, labour, work or creativity for a medium of exchange does not use force either.
Now, you have failed to prove that the state is a necessary condition for capitalism, or that self-interest necessarily leads to the state, or that I am even attempting to apologize for actually-existing capitalism.

Furthermore, do you believe that people act self-interestedly all the time, or only? Are you a psychological egoist? Surely Altruism is possible, even prevalent in society. Isn't it something philosophers should be advocating rather than acting like it doesn't exist?"

I'm 20, M, university student. Personally, I think voting socialist is in my best interest as in the next few years I'll graduate and join the job market. My view was heavily influenced by the whole ""minijob"" situation in Germany. All the right-wing or liberal political parties seemed to think that was a great idea. Yeah, working for less than minimum wage with no room for improvement or ""vast contract"" sounds fucking splendid. We really need more of that.

So, that narrows it down to SPA, Groen or PvdA. PvdA is too left-wing for me. SPA is way too conflicted in everything; look at the whole Aalst debacle, looks like there is no communication going on in that party whatsoever. SPA is also really lacking in competent people in my personal opinion, there's Vande Lanotte and that's about it. Groen on the other hand looks like alright, there's lots of young people and they appear to be the only ones concerning themselves with things that matter to young people today. (Global warming, internet freedom, Europe etc.)

As I said though, it's choosing for lesser evils in the upcoming elections.

EDIT: It's very interesting to read your opinions. I would like to see people include things like a basic profile of themselves though because this ""poll"" (hardly a poll, I know) seems to contradict the old-fashioned polls. Most polls state NVA is the bigggest party because they're apparently very much liked by younger people and teenagers. I see lots of other opinions here though, almost no one likes NVA and looks like most people will vote either Open VLD, PvdA or Groen. I wonder why that is and what Reddit's demographic is then."

There are some things that certain races are just inherently better at. It doesn't actually have anything to do with the skin color, but that's not the only trait of a race now is it? Black people tend to have wider shoulders and thicker chests, this makes them have a higher center of mass and therefore makes them naturally better runners. Which is why all runners at the Olympic level are black. 

White people have the most balanced center of mass and center of buoyancy. This makes white people naturally better swimmers than other races. Has nothing to do with skin color, but still has to do with race.

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390435371.0,"&gt;  Most people bond over superficial crap. They form relationships based purely on entertainment.

With all due respect, but I can't disagree more with this concept. Superficial crap perhaps, but what you might call ""entertainment"", I call ""common interests"". Without something in common, a relationship between friends is pretty much doomed to fail. 

I'd suggest though that the overall opinion on reddit in relation to this topic is skewed by the fact that a higher percentage of redditors are likely to be lower on the extrovert scale than some. I base this (personal) opinion on the fact that all of the truly extroverted people I've known have near on to zero tolerance for digital communication. They seem to prefer physical interaction rather than communicating with a gestalt entity like the reddit hivemind. 

The knock on effect of this participant bias is that we more introverted individuals seem to be more discerning about the people we surround ourselves with, and so naturally tolerate less the things we consider childish, stupid or pointless, and so struggle to connect with people who aren't of like mind.

To round this back to the core concept, Redditors in general would be less tolerant of bullshit behaviour, and more selective about the kinds of people they socialize with, which means that finding large groups of them in the wild, without it being a pre-planned meet and greet event, would be less common.

I'm well aware that I'm making sweeping generalizations, and a huge amount of assumptions in this, and welcome rational and insightful debate with people carrying both similar and divergent opinions. Trolls and flame warriors can congregate over there on the left if you please =)

So while I like well-written sex scenes (/u/aunt_sandi does a damn good job of this) I also like character development and drama and some sort of *plot*, even if it's tiny. I care less about the size of your sisters tits than I do about how she felt making the decision to suck your cock, if that makes sense."

Also one strategy I like is if you want to buy something unnecessary, wait on it. A lot of the time, one week later, it doesn't seem that great. So don't let yourself buy anything unless you still want it a week later. 

It also helps me, if before I spend even a dollar on myself, to think about my accounts. I think about my debts and how much I need to get out of debt. Or I think about my account and how I want to have a healthy savings fund. And I think about how more things won't buy happiness and I should really save the money so I can do something that will make me happy, like travel or something like that.

My male fashion sense is extraordinarily simple. I LOVE CARGO SHORTS. There, I said it. I love love *love* men's khaki cargo shorts. I don't give two shits about pastel bermuda shorts, Sperry Top-Siders (""boat shoes""), and leather boots. 

After examining the [holy grail thread](https://en-us.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1vv8pm/what_is_your_current_grail_item_jan_22nd/), I've reached an understanding of what men's items I find attractive. $500+ Barbour jacket, penny loafers, hippie moccasins, and  cordovan boots aren't on that list. The Nike [Roshe Run Woven Black/Anthracite](http://cdn.solecollector.com/media/sneakers/images/Nike-Roshe-Run-Woven-02.jpg) look comfortable and stylish for a younger guy. So far the Nike shoes and a J.Crew grey cardigan were the only two items I found attractive in that thread. 

Not a fan of: plaid button down shirts, boat shoes, leather boots, tight chinos, dress shoes, pastel chambray shirts, pastel anything. Pretty much anything from Land's End or could possibly fit the ""preppy"" look.

A pair of khaki cargo shorts, solid color buttoned up shirt w/ rolled sleeves, and a pair of black sneakers is perfect. Also the more pockets, the better. Especially if we're planning on going to the movie theater later.

I was flabbergasted. After pointing out that they don't even have the financial means to live together, which I'd consider the next step, she said they could do that during their long engagement.

1wiseguy,science,1390435686.0,"The only thing they could be talking about is rotating the vehicle by creating a magnetic field in the vehicle that pulls against the Earth's magnetic field, kind of like a compass needle. This is commonly done in LEO satellite using a device called a torque rod, which is a steel rod with turns of wire around it.

This can't be done by using the net itself; it needs thousands of turn of wire around a magnetic core. The turning action that results takes days to actually move the vehicle, because the forces are weak. For quick movement, you use a reaction wheel, a motorized flywheel.

ze_blue_sky,florida,1390435857.0,"I'm a Floridian that now lives in Connecticut! I agree with /u/shroomigator, the most important part is layers. Today it was about 10 degrees out and I am wearing a shirt, a long sleeve shirt, a cardigan, a leather jacket, and my winter coat. A peacoat on top of all that will be fine if its 25+ degrees. Below that, you should think of getting a down coat. Though for only one week it's only questionably worth it.  
  
  On bottom, I have a pair of leggings under my thick jeans. My coat goes down mid thigh and my boots go under my knees so the part of my legs a little more exposed is fine.  
  
  WEAR A SCARF! AND A HAT! Cover your ears and your neck. I wouldn't worry too much about the gloves because you probably wont take your hands out of your pockets. Short of ski-gloves, there's not much that keeps my hands warm better than gloves on my hands in my coat pocket. 
  
  Sneakers are going to be cold. If you own Uggs, this is actually an appropriate time to wear them but there are much better snow boots out there. If you need to keep this cheap, what I found works oddly well, though you will get some funny looks, is super thick socks in rain boots. Rain boots don't breath and keep heat in pretty well. But people will give you looks. If not, [these](http://www.dsw.com/shoe/bearpaw+tatum+boot?prodId=254843&amp;activeCats=cat10006,cat20173,dsw10cat120044) boots are a pretty good ""cheaper"" option. The fuzzies on the inside are nice. If the weather is going to be icy though, those shoes won't have enough traction. 
  
  So if you decide you need a coat, something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Larry-Levine-Womens-Caramel-X-Small/dp/B00DAN7KJ8/ref=sr_1_3?s=apparel&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390492825&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=down+coat) is what you're looking for. Down, longish, hood."

Apparently this had become a thing, because a few years ago, the woman I had just started seeing and I were talking *Star Wars*. I don't remember exactly how it came up, but I started to tell her about that moment. Before I could get more than half a sentence in, her eyes lit up and she said, ""Tosche Station???"" It was a bonding moment. So while that line reading may have haunted you, know that it's had some constructive real-world applications, too."

11 visual magnitude is a measure of brightness in the sky.  Really good people in a dark place using their naked eye can see mag 6 or 7; Sirius is -1.  Some people claim to be able to see mag 10 point sources with their naked eye; others argue that this is not possible; mag 11 is too dim for anyone.  As an example, Andromeda galaxy, Messier object M31, is mag 3.5, but it is not a point source so it is harder to see, still, most folks can see it with their naked eye under the right conditions.

The Bortle scale is a measure of light pollution.  Light pollution can spoil viewing for many urban viewers.

The Messier catalog is Charles Messier's old list of about 110 deep-sky objects that are fuzzy or nebulous.  He used a 4 inch refracting telescope to look for comets; these were mostly fuzzy things (to his eye, from urban Paris) that were always in the same place in the sky and he made the catalog so as to not confuse them for comets.

Messier object 82 (M82) is the galaxy where the supernova was seen yesterday.  It is nearby as galaxies go - 12 million light years away.

My telescope's primary mirror is a 10 inch paraboloid mirror; the shorthand for that is 10"" reflector.  To learn more about my telescope, you can go on Google or Amazon and look for ""Orion XT10."""

heartosay,Catholicism,1390436003.0,"The usual definition of Protestant is a trinitarian Christian who is neither Catholic nor Orthodox. Lutherans and Anglicans would generally be considered High (or liturgical) Protestants, Calvinists and Baptists would be Low (non-liturgical) Protestants. I know very little about Anabaptists but I would presume them to be very Low Protestants.

Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Unitarians aren't generally considered Protestants, as they're non-trinitarian.

Of course, there's no formal definition of what Protestantism is and who does and does not constitute one, but I'd never before heard it said that Baptists wouldn't be considered Protestant.

Actually, it seems you're drawing a line between those denominations which entered into schism at the Reformation and those which formed later but this is a distinction I've never heard any Protestant or Catholic draw before."

We were in the same 5th grade class together and I had a crush on him because he looked like Harry Potter. (This was the year the first movie came out, 2001-2002)

When Facebook got big, we added each other and would comment every now and then. We had a similar sense of humor and taste in music. We REALLY started talking a lot in July of 2012, and I thought he was cute and funny (turns out he thought that about me too!!)

I went to Warped Tour and was supposed to meet up with ~10 of my friends, but had horrible cell service and gave up. The one friend I rode up with and I were jamming out to Yellowcard (I know, throwback, right?!) and who do I see coming towards me?

I'd lost my copy of the contract when I figured it out about 4 months later.

Or only let a small portion of people know you are doing something pro-bono. Parading it around takes some of that away. 

Think about it like a restaurant. Some places will do an item for free if something goes wrong. The *quietly* go ""we are terribly sorry your main course is on the house"" they don't pull out all the bells and whistles and get the whole dining room's attention and go ""ATTENTION DINERS!!! WE ARE GIVING THIS FAMILY THEIR MAIN COURSE FOR FREE!!"" 

I understand that being the lawyer for a high-profile case will get you publicity no matter what. These lawyers don't have to get really in your face about deciding to do it for free. That is my problem. 

I work in janitorial, and whether I'm working on the clock or staying 15 minutes past and working for free because I noticed I forgot something. I do the same level of care no matter what. 

Understand everyone is out for the dollars at the end of the day. I know that's how the world works, so no, I don't need a rude awakening. And yes the accused deserves a fair trial, and deserves a lawyer I am not contesting that. I do appreciate that someone is always willing to defend someone even if deep down they believe that person is guilty as fuck. And they still do as good a job as they possibly can. Even if they don't have a paycheck waiting for them back at the office for their services. I am involved in this case and so it is very emotional for me and so I feel a certain way about their lawyers but also do understand that they are allowed to have their own legal counsel as well.

flashmedallion,truegaming,1390436528.0,"In addition, I think the main setup - the promise made in the first game and continued in the second - would have been fulfilled.

Desmond (and the player) was learning and being trained to be an Assassin.  The third game would have fulfilled this narrative (and mechanical) pledge by having a significant open-world, modern-day setting and gameplay.  It might not have been exclusively modern day; imagine a finale to the trilogy where you can go into the Animus to research an area or events, and then leave the Animus and explore that same area in the present.

I strongly believe this was the intention made from the start and the progression of Desmonds playability in AC1 and AC2 support this.  Even Brotherhood takes this further.

I'd like to think the modern-day setting would have actually shared something in common with the limited platforming and stealth we had in ACIII, namely the utter lack of HUD.  One of the few redeeming features of the modern day sequences in ACIII is the original panic and having no indicators, no HUD, no nothing... and slowly realizing that *we have been trained how to be an assassin for three games now* and we don't need these things.  The muscle memory is already there.

That was a brilliant union of the mechanics with the narrative, and the original AC was *very* high-concept with regards to the Animus interface and the overall conceit of the game.  I think if Desilets was still around, the final installment in the Trilogy would have capitlized on this and been as bold a leap in gaming as AC2 was to AC1, and AC1 was in the context of its release."

FactualPedanticReply,legaladvice,1390436533.0,"You seem to care a great deal about teaching your material effectively, and that's not to be diminished. I can't really tell from context whether you're talking about huge lectures or smaller, more individualized learning settings, either. I gotta say, though, that it sounds like you're taking something very personally that is largely impersonal. The number of classes I've sat through while half paying attention and half doing something else is pretty high; this is because I don't really pay attention during times where the material being covered is something I already understand or know. Instead, I pay enough attention to notice novel material or points, occasionally stop to take notes, and think about other things. 

I have no doubt that there are genuinely rude students in your classes, and I do not doubt that your outrage at their behavior is justified. I just felt the need to interject that I've definitely spent time checking my phone, reading books, or looking at facebook in classes taught by professors to whom I meant no disrespect. If a student complains that you ""never told them"" something on the exam, the problem isn't that students sometimes distract themselves during lecture, nor is it that that specific student uses facebook during lecture. The problem is that that specific student did not hear that specific piece of information and refuses to believe it was said. In the larger view, it may well be that that specific student is not good at actively deciding how to direct their attention during lectures, regardless of whether the competing target is ""facebook"" or just ""daydreaming.""

I work in the corporate world now, and I don't know a single person, peon to VP, who doesn't check social media on their computer or phone several times throughout the day. It's not the specifics of the activity in question that are indicative of immaturity; it's the behavioral pattern and attitude. This is why making up ""seemingly dumb"" rules is more a band-aid than a solution. Banning computers and cell phones in class just takes the tone back to that dumb ""adult authority""/""misbehaving child"" dynamic, and it's counterproductive. You gotta elevate the discourse from ""don't do this one specific thing"" to ""I feel like I'm being treated rudely; please be sensitive to that dynamic"" - Otherwise, you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

seanomenon,typography,1390436717.0,"ok, it makes a little more sense.

First off, a widow and an orphan are two different things. 

A widow is when the last line of a paragraph is a single word or syllable.

An orphan is when the last line of a paragraph jumps to the next column. This is the problem you're describing. 

You can have both, that would be a single word on its own line at the beginning of the column. You can usually fix that with a rebreak and/or tightening the tracking.

A few options to fix your orphan:

+ Adjust the the Hyphenation &amp; Justification preferences to always keep the last 2 lines of a paragraph together. 
+ Manually break the text so the last two lines go to the next column. (Use soft returns.)
+ Cheat the column to be a little longer, keeping the whole paragraph together.

No matter what, you should keep a consistent leading throughout both columns of text. "

MeloDet,DCcomics,1390436801.0,"This was really good. Far better than the comic version. The relationships they were supposedly focusing on all came across great. Batman/Green Lantern was hilarious, and Shazam/Cyborg served to really improve the origin of the latter, he came across really strong here. His origin is expanded and he's given a much larger chunk of time than he was in the comics. Hopefully the Shazam/Cyborg interactions carry over into the Justice League comic since Billy seemed to help Victor deal with his issues better than he has in the comic. Superman/Wonder Woman had quite a significant amount of flirting and are pretty much undoubtedly going to become a couple in this animated verse. Some might say that the flirting is just because they are both strong, but does it really take more than finding someone attractive to flirt with them? Add to that the fact they are both meeting an equal for the first time and it makes perfect sense (to me at least). Most of the issues one might have are from the comic, and in many cases the movie fixed them to a degree. I know some may not be happy about the tone DC seems to be going for as of late(Superman Unbound, Flashpoint and this), but to be honest I quite enjoy it. That's not to say that it's ""grimdark,"" just that the films seem a little more mature. They don't hold back on the language which to some would be disappointing, but personally one of the things that can really pull me out of the story is ""child friendly dialogue."" They don't need to be dropping f-bombs, but I can't help but roll my eyes whenever a character says something like ""I'm going to kick your butt!"" (Seriously, is saying ass really that bad?). Anyway, good film. More than anything this makes me excited for future possibilities in this New52 DCAU.(Jeans &amp; T-Shirt Superman movie please)"

bunker_man,religion,1390436979.0,"Gnosticism as a definition is basically based on the idea that life is divided between two realms. The corrupt. (Note that corrupt could mean ignorant instead of evil) physical realm, and the pure spiritual one. Note that it is not inherently, dualistic, and in many versions these two realms are made of the same essence. The goal of a gnostic then is to shift their view from the differentiated physical world to the pure spiritual one. If you know anything about Buddhism it is very similar to buddhism, in the goals of freeing yourself from Samara. 

Most forms of Gnosticism also considers Jesus an important teacher. Teachings on him range from thinking he was a literal divine entity, to thinking that since everyone was his descent made him a normal human, merely who could remember his divinity, to even thinking he was a regular person, or even a fictional character used as iconography of a teaching point.

Gnosticism usually posits the ""source"" as a quasi impersonal essence that all life came from as a spiritual existence. At some point some of this corrupted itself and caused the physical world. One version of this is the story of the accidental creation of the demiurge, who as an ignorant being mistakenly considered itself god, and created a physical world. Not all gnostics considered this literal. It was more an issue of the error of trying to quantify god as a concrete humanly understandable thing, and freeing yourself from it akin to understanding the infinite depths which are beyond us.

There's a bit of controversy over gnostic morals, since the concept of freeing almost seems amoral to some. Where as their ascetic declarations seems uber strict morally. Many modern people interpret gnosticism as amoral, even though there is not as much evidence of this actually being the case at the time.

That's a basic primer. It covers the important parts. Basically think of it as buddhism, but with christian iconography, and which interprets the god many people worship as akin to a devil figure that needs to be gone beyond to find the ""true god."" (It was controversial back then too, since despite claiming to be part of christianity considered the old testament's god to be the evil god.)"

I'd recommend saving up a little more, especially since you already have something that works for now. I know money's a little tight with the little one and all (congratulations on that, by the way), but if you're serious about this, I'd get something more reliable and proven. If you have an opportunity, at least try to handle a few different guns at your LGS or something to see how they feel/fit in your hand.

My standard recommendations are: Glock 17/19, S&amp;W M&amp;P9, and Springfield XD9 or XDM9. Ruger SR9 isn't a bad choice either. These should all be in the $450-550 range but the M&amp;P's and XD's can go down to $400 sometimes if you look carefully.

Plus, if I were to remove someone's post for being an old comic when it was just barely over the deadline, they'll probably be mad at me and try to convince me to approve it. It just isn't worth the trouble. Besides, this:

fiat_lux_,MensRights,1390437166.0,"On reddit, I generally see more sympathy on the issue of genital mutilation against men, but I'm consistently surprised offline by how many people don't think it's a big deal offline IRL.

Maybe it's just the area I live in, but I frequently hear some women say it's not a big deal when it's brought up, or that women have it way worse. I've literally heard one chick claim that the testicles are a great cushion to protect the pelvic bone from damage. (She worded it more pseudo-intellectually, and made it about how a good kick can shatter the pelvic bone of a woman, because she has no such ""cushion"".)

Genital mutilation/assault against women is not acceptable either, but it's just the general attitude that it isn't a big deal if I or another guy gets hit hard or sexually mutilated is bizarre. You hear about *""grab him by balls / twist""* quite often as acceptable punishment for ""bad men"".

flashmedallion,truegaming,1390437187.0,"It wouldn't.

Hotline Miami is loses all meaning when there's no-one actually *taking part*.  The whole point revolves around your experience - the ""plot"" as it stands merely serves to contextualise this and point at it.

So the things that Hotline Miami is trying to talk about are only really served by the interactivity.  A camera pan across a room of dead bodies after a fight scene is not the same thing as you actually walking back through all the carnage that you have caused.  This is games *as* art, not games that happen to have art in them.  The interactivity is the fundamental medium that they are communicating in.  In cinema the medium is a frame, with a composed image inside it that changes 24 times every second.

So you can't make a movie out of the art that is Hotline Miami.  You can make cinema that uses form and techniques that are fundamental to its own medium to discuss the same or similar ideas, but that will no longer be Hotline Miami.  It will be other things.  Drive, as mentioned, is a good example. 

As an aside, even though something like Metal Gear Solid is ""cinematic"" in nature, this is the same reason a Metal Gear Solid movie will never really be Metal Gear Solid the artwork.. The game's speaks through it's medium - its interactivity and the relationship between the player and their actor, and the environment and context that both find themselves in.  No More Heroes is another great, if cruder,  example of that."

I think so many people think its not a big deal because so many people get accientaly diagnosed without a lap. a lap is the only way to confirm it, But I know doctors who say ""sounds like endo, we will put you on BC"" to women who *just* have the cramping symptoms. now it could be endo, and their pain is real and effects them, but often BC works for them, or the pain is bearable for them, so when *we* complain that BC didn't work or that the pain is debilitating, they think ""but its *just* endo""

After my functional MRI that showed my uterus is glued in place, I seem to get a lot more sympathy, its no longer *just* endo, Its *bad* endo. maybe you need to explain your internal octopus's garden to people who seem to think endo is not that bad. It always helps to compare it to cancer when people are being really stupid about it.

Ostrololo,bestof,1390437495.0,"That's not what /u/malachi23 is saying. Their logic is essentially ""people can't complain if they can just walk away."" After all, if the student dislikes the conditions imposed by the professor, he can forfeit his privilege of attending the class. The argument can be applied to any form of human interaction: If Alice and Bob are making an exchange, and Alice dislikes Bob's terms, she can walk away, but she can't complain. Makes sense, right?

Except this is erasing a factor in the equation. We humans aren't perfectly rational, we are also emotional. And the emotion playing a role here is our sense of justice. Ultimately, we are moral creatures, and we want to believe that ourselves, as well as others, are being treated fairly. That's why *it's disrespectful to propose an exchange that is seen as unfair*. I'm not talking out of my ass; this is basic negotiation. Sure, you can just shut up and walk away if you don't agree with a proposal. That's the rational thing to do. But emotionally, we feel like we are being taken advantage of, that the person proposing the exchange is acting in bad faith. It's immoral. *That's* why you have every right to be offended when presented with injustice that you can simply walk away from.

I won't argue here whether the professor is being unfair or not with their demands. However, /u/malachi23's argument is faulty: the student *does* have the right of being offended if the professor proposes a rule that the student sees as unjust, despite the student not being forced to obey it.

Malachi's comeuppance is unfair and unjustified: that's why I felt the need to write this post in the first place, even though I could just shut up and move on! Humans find injustice in any form—an unfair class rule, a condescending reddit post, war mutilation—appalling!"

Ingredients

-2 pounds tomatoes, cut in wedges

-1 red pepper, cut in half and seeded

-1 onion, sliced into rings

-4 cloves garlic, whole and unpeeled

-olive oil

-salt and pepper to taste

-1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika

-1 teaspoon oregano

-2 cups vegetable broth or chicken broth or chicken stock

-1/4 cup heavy cream, optional

Directions

-Place the tomatoes, red pepper, onions and garlic on a baking pan with the cut sides up.

-Drizzle a bit of olive oil over everything and season with salt and pepper.

-Roast in a 375F preheated oven for 45 minutes.

-Place everything but the cream into a sauce pan and simmer for 15 minutes.

-Puree with a hand blender to desired consistency and mix in the cream.

-Put down a tarp.

Now let's jazz this shit up and serve with a grilled cheese.  Not that shitty kraft single cheese either.  Get some Muenster, Extra Sharp Cheddar, and some Gouda.  Get your choice of bread (I like Sour Dough or Wheat), put your cheese on the bread.  Cover the outside of each slice with Mayonnaise *NOT BUTTER.*  Yes, Mayo.  Just enough to cover the face of the bread, so spread it thin.  Put it on a nice hot griddle or frying pan and let that baby cook.  If you're having trouble getting the cheese to melt, splash some water next to the sandwich so it gets all steamy and quickly cover it with a pot.  Steam/enclosed space will melt the cheese easier.  Cook until both sides are nice and golden brown/crispy.

Many men are surprised at the amount of female attention they get at those ages, in comparison to the amount of attention they got from women in their late teens and 20's. I don't think men have to be rich, just financially stable to be desirable.

Author Lori Gottlieb's wrote a 'controversial' book about the phenomenon of women losing desirability from 35+ and male desirability increasing 35+ (in the US). A lot of feminists and women really didn't like her controversial book - I thought it was a great read.

From an article written about Lori's book;

&gt; Then she serves up a few more choice statistics: that there are 28 million single women over 35 in the US, and 18 million men; that this forms a ­""reverse power curve"" (read: men have options, women become desperate); that men want to (and can) marry younger women; that older men are more jaded and have more baggage; and that ""the longer you wait, the less likely you are to find someone better than you've already met"".

A PE firm deals with private companies (usually), so there is no day to day buying and selling, since there is a lot of dealings and paperwork to be done in buying an entire company or a large part of one.  Hedge funds however buy and sell whatever they want (anything from stocks to physical commodities) and so they trade on the market everyday.  This means PE is closer to banking in terms of the amount of modelling and relationship-focused work, while hedge funds rotate around market hours more, depending on what they're buying and selling."

My friend goes to cross the street and without looking for traffic just zips across to the other side and nearly gets clipped by a car. I am still on the other side of the street and yell out ""HEY! Are you retarded or something!"" Right after I yell that out I look to my right and there is this sweet little girl with downs syndrome riding a bike with training wheels with her mom. The girl just looks at me and gives a big smile. I felt like hitler. And the look of disgust on the moms face. Even for my young teenage brain I still was heartbroken. And that is why I never call people retarded anymore, because you never know.

FactualPedanticReply,legaladvice,1390438492.0,"As a former student and now corporate professional in a technical field, I have commentary:

1) Telling people in the syllabus to not fuck with their phones in class? Legit. Saying in the first class when you go over the syllabus that it's because it's distracting? Legit. Chewing someone out for fucking this up? Legit. Requiring that they all be in a box at the front of the room? A little much. Treat them like adults - just moderate that knowing that they also have poor judgment. If it's a reasonably consistent issue, remind them at the beginning of each class. If there're consistent repeat offenders, pursue disciplinary action. If dealing with immature 18-22 year olds is trying your patience too much, might I suggest some moping about how unfair the world is, followed by a career change.

2) Profs aren't obliged to foster an open and communal atmosphere, it's true. They're not required to be kind, either. They're not required to manage the human dynamics, either. In fact, they're not actually obliged to care at all whether their students learn. The question is what would be capital-G Good? And, as for this ""expert mastery"" bullshit? Go to a conference and take a couple levels in humility there, jack. If you're in post-graduate academia and you don't think of yourself as more a student than a teacher, you have some serious ego problems.

3) It's a good thing that general rules for human interaction trump setting-specific rules, then! People fuck things up all the time, and it inconveniences other people. As a person interacting with people, you can get your gears all jammed over this shit, or you can roll with it. The first time you interrupt your lecture to tell your established-favorite student you're going to let them slide just once on forgetting to silence their phone, stop and consider the broader ethics. Unless you're telling me you'd take punitive action against your most promising, charismatic student for making an understandable, common mistake!"

smartzie,worldnews,1390438682.0,"Well, as a small lady who used to work late nights by myself and also walk alone after night classes (and has been approached by men wanting me to get in their car), I don't think it's paranoid or unjustified to want to carry something more than pepperspray, just in case. And most of the people in my area that own guns use them for hunting or shooting pest animals. I advocate for stricter gun laws and restrictions for certain people, but I'm fine with responsible people owning them. Every person I know owns a gun of some kind, but I only know of one person who has ever shot someone, and that was because his store was being robbed at gun-point. 

Also, I don't believe that most Americans answer problems by throwing guns at them. That feels like an unjust stereotype considering how many Americans *don't* own guns and how many would like to abolish the 2nd Amendment. 

America has ALWAYS had guns. We've never not had guns. It would be impossible to get rid of them, at this point. Might as well just try to create better laws to regulate them and teach safety and responsibility to gun owners. "

Favourite country: Is it biased if I say Canada? I once visited Vancouver and had a blast - gorgeous area and plenty to do. However, I have family there and we had lots of fun with them and made some good memories there. Outside of Canada, though, I really enjoyed Ireland (both the Republic and Northern Ireland). There is a lot of history, a lot of sights, gorgeous scenery (we got to see the Slieve League at sunset...breathtaking!), good pub food (and good beer, according to my friend; I'm not much of a beer drinker), and all the Irish people we encountered were very friendly.

We're going to leave the zone entrances open on PTS for now but guided tests generally give us the best feedback and are always fun for everyone involved. Contact me via PMs or post here with contact info and I will arrange a playtest. The fights are T3 and will be tuned accordingly so guilds with T2 experience are preferred.

Speaking from experience as I was the out of control depressed/self harm/low self esteem teenager, not getting my way would piss me the FUCK off and I hated my mom, but she got with the tough love program and I'm thankful that she did. I have turned out well and doubt I would have if she kept enabling my behavior. Sounds like you may want to consider being a hardass with your daughter.

If you do decide to take a tough love stance, she will get over her anger with you and later down the road she'll see how right you were to not support her habit. It's absurd that you are putting your health at risk to buy her drugs.

heartosay,Christianity,1390439681.0,"&gt; If you have an argument for why personhood begins at conception that isn't based in scripture, I'd be happy to discuss it. But that's all I've seen so far. 

I don't believe there's any argument in scripture that life begins at conception, though I may be wrong.

For me, the deciding issue is the fallacy that time = development.

For instance, where I live, if you're 17 years and 364 days old, it is illegal to consume alcohol because you are a child and alcohol - even in moderation - is severely detrimental to the physical and social welfare of children.

However, if you instead consume alcohol 24 hours later, you are perfectly entitled to do so, because you are an adult and alcohol in moderation is not sufficiently detrimental to your well-being to justify its criminalisation.

Now, such rules are necessary because there has to be a margin of error, leaning on the side of social and personal utility, constraining individual rights in any workable society. Here, the worst-case scenario is that some teenagers don't get to drink until they turn 18. Social utility isn't on their side, and their own personal utility often is not on their side (if they are sufficiently underdeveloped that alcohol could cause them damage).

Now, any stance on abortion other than a blanket ban requires believing that at (say) 23 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours the foetus is a random cluster of cells undeserving of life and human consideration. However, an hour later this cluster has become a viable foetus, deserving of the right to life, even though nothing has essentially changed in the past hour.

This arbitrary distinction can be justified if the social and/or personal utility allows it. However, where the right in question is the right to life, whether you accept the foetus is a life or not, the justification for constraining it has to be higher than for constraining other rights, as you are otherwise condemning human life to death. I believe that neither the social utility nor the personal utility of the parents can justify drawing such an arbitrary distinction between the foetus not deserving protection one minute, and deserving it the next.

Therefore, except in exceptional circumstances such as a threat to the life of the mother, I can't see any justification for abortion. In the interests of logical consistency and coherence, therefore, the embryo/foetus has to be protected at all stages of development, which begins at conception."

I do a lot of trekking with my lenses and night photography, especially while camping. I know that I can take precautions, but at the same time I have to make a risk assessment. Most of the pictures that I take are out in the wilderness, and living in the PNW we have really shitty light most of the time. 

Do I need the 14-24 with the extra little oomph in f/ stop? I am not sure. I do notice a huge difference when I shoot on my 28-300 (at f/3.5) and my 50mm prime (f/1.4) especially in really dark landscapes that I like to shoot and my results tend to be better with the prime.

mkvgtired,technology,1390439695.0,"&gt; laws explicitly supporting them

Not laws, law groups. Kind of like the ACLU deals with constitutional issues, there are tons of legal groups that have one cause they work on, often pro bono, or as a non-profit. A fund might actually be the best setup, because after a favorable federal case or two it would likely no longer be necessary (unless two appellate courts disagree). 

&gt;I don't want to see the private sector completely cut out

That seems to be Chicago's end goal. A Google executive told Chicago politicians to pull fiber when they revamped their sewer system. So I'm thinking Google might have their eye on leasing Chicago's infrastructure to speed up the deployment of Google Fiber in Chicago. 

That is completely based on nothing except the Google executive's comments, but I'm hoping that is the case. Google not only offers great service, but also great hardware. I am not so sure I'd trust a service ran by Chicago to be as well run or offer as good of hardware. "
incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390439697.0,"Edit: Just saw the risk comment.  There are a lot of folks here who really know what they're doing.  I would go with someone who has at least 3 successful deals under their belt.  So there is _some_ risk you might lose some of your money (it has happened), but it's pretty low.  The real risk would be a major market/economic event happening in the middle of turning the property around, then you could potentially lose your investment.  OTOH if you are buying a class C with 60% occupancy and rents $200 below market, it's probably not going to get a lot worse no matter what happens, so a lot of it comes down to doing your diligence before getting into a deal.

---

Flipping is a waste of time (flipping is for people who don't have money/need to raise money). Just unload the less-good deals to wholesalers for $1k-2k up front with 0 risk.

Return on capital gain is hypothetical until the place is sold.  That target just indicates that I want to double my money after accounting for cost of sale in terms of equity capture.  Cash on cash return means that if it costs me $10k out of pocket to buy/rehab/hold/rent the place, then I want a minimum of $2500/year in net cashflow after management, vacancies/leasing and maintenance (basically, I put in $10k, I want to be able to sell the place for $10k profit as well as make $2500 annual profit on the deal).  I'd recommend reading up on real estate finance, as these are all standard financial terms.

Those are fairly high standards, so I would probably end up unloading at least 10 deals to wholesalers for every 1 I kept for myself.  Based on the wholesalers I work with, I suspect I could do at least 1 'keep' deal and 10 'pass' deals per month, maybe more."

Also it isn't really that great if you want to take pics of larger groups of people like on parties or your family dinner. You can manage but it can get a bit annoying. 

I rarely use my 55-200mm but it will work for wildlife. Sports... if you have enough light. I would go for the VR edition though.

Thjoth,EarthPorn,1390439953.0,"It's interesting to see how this plays out in the history of arms design.  If you go to a military museum and look at the rifles or even the artillery pieces, you'll notice that the oldest ones fired relatively large, massive  projectiles, and as engineers got better at designing aerodynamic projectiles and improved propulsion systems (gunpowders and rocket-assisted artillery shells with more potent explosive payloads, for example), the size of the projectile shrank and began to rely more and more upon pure speed, with the additional positive effect of allowing soldiers to carry more ammunition.  Around the mid 1960s, the size and mass of the projectiles hit their lowest point as velocity reigned supreme, and then have very slowly begun to incrementally expand again as ballistics engineers have searched for the perfect balance between mass, velocity, and ballistic coefficient for accurately inflicting maximum damage on a given target.  

I'd never stopped to think about this before until I went to a museum and saw their ""rifles through time"" and ""field artillery through time"" exhibits; there's a very noticeable pattern in projectile size when you see 400 years worth of them all lined up together in chronological order."

But basically, there is a lot of debate about nature vs nurture, and a lot of the science is showing that nature has a far larger effect than we would have assumed. For instance IQ is entirely nature based. For instance, researches found that having high IQ parents only have an effect when you are genetically related, but if you were adopted at 5 months old, it doesn't matter how intelligent your parents are, because it will not effect the adopted childs IQ. They tend to mirror their biological parent's IQ. These sort of things followed across individual personality. Even though the children who were adopted were adopted at a very young age and really only know their current parents, they still seemed to have inherited many more of their biological parent's character traits. It even went as far as things like smoking addiction. The common understanding of smoking addiction is that if your parents smoked, you're more likely to smoke. They found out that's not because of the presence of your parent's smoking, but because you too have an addictive gene that makes you prone to it. If the kid was adopted from parents who tried smoking, but never got addicted, it didn't matter if their parents were smokers or non-smokers. They were more likely than not to become non-smokers, regardless of their adopted parent's smoking habits. 

It's kind of scary how much genetics plays a role in our personal character. Since the discovery of epigenetics, it gets even more creepy. "

[Gabriel's Oboe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oag1Dfa1e_E) from the soundtrack to The Mission by Ennio Morricone

[Beethoven's Spring Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfm-zJLYWB8) The Adagio that begins at 10:12 is especially beautiful.

I'll limit it to that for now but feel free to leave a comment if you'd like more recommendations.

Edit: Oh, I'm sorry, I just noticed you asked for instrumental music. I guess my first three are not relevant then.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390440312.0,"&gt; I guess I never felt like reporting would do any good, but maybe that's not true.

Reporting won't - we don't see it as mods, or at least it's much more involved to see it. I never understood this until I was one last week. MESSAGE us instead - then we have a red envelope-type cue for us that someone has messaged us."
riseandrise,AskMen,1390440312.0,"I see a lot of other women commenting so I'm going to jump in here too: I've been on the pill almost continually for 12 years. I got lucky and the first one I tried had none of the bad side effects, all of the good side effects, and works perfectly. I also prefer sex without condoms. But if a guy I was only just starting to become interested in told me that use of condoms in our (potential) LTR was a deal breaker, I'd thank him for his time and peace out. 

It comes off as so controlling, I can't even begin to tell you. You're basically saying ""I expect you to take full responsibility for pregnancy prevention, regardless of what havoc it might wreak on your health, emotions and finances"". Also, despite saying that you don't want to pressure women to go on birth control to please you, you don't seem to comprehend that that's what your ultimatum is. You're saying ""Go on birth control or we can't have a relationship"". Some women, like me, will bail because this seems petty and controlling. Other women might instead do something that will really screw them up just to keep you.

I notice that you're quite young, so I can't help asking... Have you had success with this ultimatum in the past? Have most, or any, women responded positively? Were they all young? Because I think as the women you date age, you'll find fewer women willing to deal with this. Maybe, if I really liked the guy, this would have worked on me when I was in college... At 29, I now know better than to deal with anyone this selfish. 

That said, it's not *unreasonable* for you to have requirements. This is just one that I think will backfire severely. You'll miss out on a ton of quality women, and potentially end up with that rare one who ""forgets"" to take her pill and ends up knocked up."

If he wasn't that in to me, he wouldn't have stuck around as long as he has, he's just not the jealous type and is fine with me having male friends. 

You and you SO may not be happy about it, but I'm not in that relationship. I'm in one where it's okay because we're both open about everything, we trust each other and I personally couldn't think of anything worse than sleeping with one of my friends.

gametemplar,twilightimperium,1390440377.0,"The neutral planets aren't necessarily empty at the beginning of the game. Much of the flavor text on the cards implies that there are indigenous populations or settlements of some kind on most (if not all) of them. I've always interpreted this to mean that they are populated by a combination of the Great Races and/or minor races that either don't have a presence in the council or enough of a stake in the war to make a claim on the throne.

Thematic explanations aside, /u/Bolusop has the right of it with his/her comment about the Distant Suns optional rule. This rule uses Domain Counters to represent different things the Great Races find when they attempt to claim the planet as part of their burgeoning empire, and it covers everything from untapped resources to local populations that refuse to simply be conquered.

Use of these counters would be almost exactly what you are describing and are listed in the core rule book and expanded in the Shattered Empire rules. It's not all hostile indigenous populations, but there's a good variety of different effects; you can refer to the back of either rule book for a full list of effects. Opinions on this option are sharply divided, as well. Some see it as an extra bit of randomness that slows down the early game, while others feel that it adds a bit of exploration to the game. There's no denying that it can certainly favor some players while hindering others, though the Territorial Distant Suns option from Shattered Empire mitigates this somewhat. Still, if you're looking for more interesting early expansion, you should consider using this option."

is_usually_wrong,saplings,1390440630.0,"With mids, the strain tends to be random. So every time you pick up, it could be a totally different strain (Like comparing mac and  pc. Same thing but very different). Next up is how much you smoke. If you only take a hit or two, it'll be a totally different high than if you smoke an entire Joint by yourself. Also I'd argue that how you smoke it changes the high, too. Vaporizers are different than combustion. Additionally, I think how you smoke it changes the high (unsupported hypothesis). Because I noticed smoking out of a bong or a bubbler gives a more heady, clean-feeling high. So the moral of the story is that you won't have much consistency.  What you're describing sounds normal. Also, I forgot to mention that whatever mood you're in before you smoke, you'll be twice that after you smoke. If you're feeling lazy, you'll get lazier. If you're in a good mood, you'll have a fantastic positive outlook.    All this to say, why would you want every high to be the same thing?"

UnholyDemigod,AskReddit,1390440664.0,"Well, considering my entire family, all my friends, my girlfriend, and everyone I have ever known is now dead, I'd probably be pretty fucken distraught. If I actually managed to get over this, I now have to face the fact I am living in biblical times. With all of humanity dead, infrastructure has collapsed. That means no running water. No electricity . Sure, I can use a generator, but where will I get the fuel from? I'd also have to hunt my own food. I would also have to learn how to store meat, because I have no access to a fridge or freezer. That means finding salt. After all the shop supplies of salt have gone, it's either mine salt, or become vegetarian. Which means I'd have to grow my own food. I don't know the first fucking thing about farming. The only thing I know about crop rotation is that it was a good upgrade in AOE2. And not only would I have to deal with all this shit just to even survive, I'd have to do it in permanent isolation. I would never hear another human's voice. I'd never feel the touch of a woman again. I'd never have a beer with my mates. And then there's the lack of entertainment. I couldn't watch tv, or play xbox, or go on the internet. Sure, I could read, but doing that 24/7 would become shit very quickly.

In all honesty, after getting over the deaths of everyone I know, I'd probably try to live up for a few days/weeks on the dwindling supplies or resources, then I'd most likely just kill myself."

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390440669.0,"It depends.  The way to make huge profits in multifamily is to buy a class C ('cheap' but not 'warzone') that has shitty occupancy and below-market rents, drop some money in upgrades/rehab, turn over shitty tenants, replace management, ramp up marketing and raise occupancy and rent per door.

E.g. fake numbers:

50-unit

12% cap rate

$10,000 NOI (20k gross revenue, $10k expenses)

80% occupancy

$500/door rent

This place would be worth $1M ($120k annual income divided by 12% cap rate)

**18-months later**

50-unit

12% cap rate

96% occupancy

$600/door rent

$28,800 gross income, $10k expenses, $18.8k NOI

$1.88M value

---

This is a pretty reasonable case, where by just making some minor improvements (possibly just getting rid of bad tenants and replacing management), you fix occupancy and produce a small increase in rent per door, and make $900k.  Let's say you put 30% down for this deal, and spent another 10% in repairs/upgrades, so you have $400k in the deal... well now you have $1.2M in equity (the $300k from your down-payment and the $900k in value you created).  So you can go ahead and cash out refi and pull back out your $400k (or more), use it to buy another place, and enjoy the cashflow from your 50-unit building."

It is very easy to get sick off of cross contaminated cooking utensils and dishes. Temperature does not destroy gluten, which is why we cannot eat cake that's been baked in the oven. I know it sounds like it should work, but it doesn't work that way. Gluten for some reason just seems to stick to EVERYTHING. 

Seriously though about the utensils, whoever cooks, make sure you are using separate spoons to stir gf and non gf dishes, had a bout of getting sick because of that when my fiance's parents didn't understand the whole thing. 

Also there are tons of unhealthy gluten free desserts and foods that should help you gain weight. You just have to find them. Check your area for a gluten free store, they generally have awesome unhealthy gluten free treats. Although my biggest concern is that if there is still gluten foods in your house you are probably still ingesting gluten on a regular basis so it's going to be hard to gain weight, unfortunately. I don't know any person with celiac who is able to live with non gf roommates and not get gluten sick sometimes. "

This attitude has served us well in the past, but I feel like it's losing relevance in the 21st century as jobs become increasingly outsourced/automated.

&gt;Standard minimum wage argument here. As per standard, you're failing to recognize that raising wages for these common jobs raises costs across the board, which as total cost of living increases means that the amount paid for these common jobs is again insufficient, leading to more arguments to increase the minimum.....etc.etc

Oh really? Then how come companies are making record profits but still ""can't afford"" to pay wages? it's not a matter of employers not having the money in MOST scenarios (I will admit there are exceptions among some small businesses), it's about greed, which is why the wealth gap is increasing so much. I don't deny that higher labor costs increase the costs of productions and services, but at the same time, the rule for such businesses in the first place is to offer as high of a cost for a product/service while cutting back on labor costs as much as possible. This is how a company maximizes a profit. The problem is, this can become exploitative, which is why the government needs to give them a nudge to provide higher wages for people (considering how the cost of labor is only PART of the cost of production, the net benefit for the min wage worker should be positive). Or, alternatively, we can have a basic income.

Also, before you get into judgments on who can make it on what, I suggest you give this a go:

Do you think the pain is coming from your actual *stomach,* or do you think it's coming from your colon? How long have you been having this type of pain?

IIRC, inflammation from UC typically starts in the rectum, and spreads upward to the rest of the colon as it gets worse. At least, that's what mine is like - I actually have pancolitis (my entire colon is affected), but my rectum is always the first part to get inflamed at the start of a flareup, and the last part to heal.  

It's possible that your disease affects a greater area of your colon than previously thought, in which case you might benefit from oral medication in addition to/instead of the suppositories. (However, keep in mind that I'm not a doctor, and this is something that could only be confirmed by having a doctor physically examine you.)

I always expected that if a supernova was discovered that it would appear as very bright pinprick.

Obviously that expectation is wrong and we are looking at a supernova that *appears* to have encompassed thousands of lightyears in a fraction of the time.

Gotslurm,AskWomen,1390441458.0,"I dated a guy for three years. Loved him, loved his family, loved his friends. I trusted him with everything in me and was never jealous or scared or worried.  When I say I loved him, I've never loved like that before or since.  He helped me through so much.  He understood me better than anyone has.  He helped me accept a lot about my life that I couldn't change.  We talked about traveling the world together.  We talked about..everything.

Then I started getting depressed. I was stressed with school, I moved away, I moved home, I was getting physically ill which made the depression worse.  I started taking an antidepressant that ruined my sex drive.  He had a high sex drive and it got so bad for me at one point that I told him I would understand if he found someone else for sex.  He never did.  He stayed by my side.

He moved to a different college, away from his friends and family.  He started getting depressed also.  He was stressed over school, bills, work, and not having the support he once did.  I couldn't help him because I was so far in my depression.

I called him one morning on my way to school crying. I told him that I wanted to die, that I was having a hard time NOT running my car off the road.  He told me he was having the same thoughts.

We couldn't support one another, we couldn't help one another, and in fact we were making life harder for one another.  There were different reasons at the very, very end that had to deal with my mental health, but I broke it off.

I stand by my decision that we really didn't need to be together then.  It's been five years and I feel like I lost the person I was supposed to live the rest of my life with.  We would talk every now and then, but a few weeks ago I finally broke down and blocked all forms of communication to try to help me get over him.  I still miss him.  He has a girlfriend.  I've been in a few relationships that were doomed from the start.  I question regularly whether I'm sabotaging them.  I still feel like I'm supposed to be with him. And it won't happen.

And in German, ""tungsten"" is known as ""wolfram"" (to name just one example of trans-lingual differences). It could very well be that different regions just have different words for stuff.

But yes, as has been said, TES minerals are *not* the same as Earth minerals that might have the same name.

Toby-one,sweden,1390441523.0,"Det är inte en så självklar relation som 1+1=... 

Eftersom det finns en massa faktorer som komplicerar saker och ting. Till exempel du faller inte död knall fall utan du är i regel sjuk innan du dör vilket leder till att du inte producerar så värst mycket vilket leder till förlorad inkomst för industrin/staten samtidigt som staten skall betala vården för de sjukdomar som är relaterade till övervikt. Att säga att man inte lever till över 65 bara för att man är grovt överviktigt är inte heller helt korrekt. Hur din prognos ser ut beror på hur sårbar du är för fetma relaterade sjukdomar + hur överviktig du är + ett antal andra faktorer. Titta på USA 1/3 av deras befolkning är överviktiga men de har fortfarande en medellivslängd som är jämförbar med Sverige, deras sjukvårdskostnader är runt dubbelt så hög som sjukvårdskostnaden är i Sverige (I internationella $ samt per capita) och den största budgetposten är just fetmarelaterade sjukdomar.

Anledningen till att folk över 65 kostar mest i Sverige är för att vi inte har samma fetma problem som existerar i till exempel USA. Är du så grovt överviktig så att du inte lever till 65 så kommer du att kosta pengar i form av sjukvård samt utebliven skatteinkomst/produktion så jag skulle säga att nej det är inte riktigt lönsamt i längden.

Obviously spam shouldn't be tolerated, but if a post is anywhere near the gray area, just let it slide or use the reddit voting system to express your opinion via a downvote.  Commenting on a discussion thread about how the thread isn't entirely relevant really just makes the thread worse and, in a roundabout kind of way, is sort of spam itself.

Also, posts like this are entertaining and contribute to this subreddit's community by encouraging discussion.  That, and the fact that SpaceX just posted the same thing on facebook, make it seem like this is a pretty solid post.  "
Triteleia,BPD,1390441585.0,"What do you usually do to pass the time? Have you had friends before? I ask this because you can help me gather anecdotal data on BPD. As someone who's been seemingly diagnosed at the age of 27 it really seems like something that warrants all sorts of information. I think, for the first time in my life I got close to someone a few months ago, and I ruined the friendship, but what's confusing is that solitude of the degree you may be alluding to, and my own--I live a pretty solitary life, and did more or less comfortably until she came and went--isn't supposed to be a symptom of BPD. Aren't borderlines supposed to constantly crave companionship and then ruin it, not not have it in the first place?

For example I've been reading about anorexia subconciously to compare and contrast with BPD, and it seems it's possible to ""infect"" people with certain types of disorders. As Kelsy Osgood writes lots of memoirs aimed at preventing and warning about anorexia actually provide a how-to manual for susceptible girls. 

Another disorder, ADD/ADHD, one author suggested, could actually be the same as BPD just misdiagnosed due to age.

And in one more book, Healing ADHD by Dr. Daniel Amen, the subcategory of ""temporal ADD"" seems to mirror BPD symptoms. In one of these posts on reddit I passingly read about someone taking something like benzodiazapines, an anticonvulsant, which are supposed to be a treatment for 'temporal ADD.' 

The above seems to suggest BPD may just be a consequence of an over-active mind, one who's neurology doesn't quite produce GABA an inhibitory neurotransmitter.

That's all to say that I'm a bit confused about my possible diagnosis, and it would be useful to know more from your prospective. 

What do you mean people don't notice you? Do you think you may just be misinterpreting things?

 * When people start living on the land where they work, where their boss is their landlord, in an urban/suburban setting you can start whining about feudalism.  

 * When people's livelihoods are simply paid by allowing them to live on land and farm a small subsistence crop to eat you can cry to me about Feudalism.   

 * When the Generals and Admirals start having a say in local and national politics and the Clergy of all the churches in the land hold almost equal power to that of elected officials you can come cry to me about Feudalism.  

Until then, stop throwing around words you don't know the meaning of, especially when you don't realize you are using them with someone who went to college to study History.  

As for your original question, I don't think Union membership has a thing to do with stagnation of wages.  I think a lack of emphasis on STEM majors in US college students and then a further lack of a lot of STEM grads to go into their fields has a lot to do with stagnation of wages.  We need to be more competitive in these fields and make it worth while to manufacture here so that jobs for less educated people will become more prevalent.  I also think a central bank is a terrible idea and has screwed with our economic situation for the last 100 years.  As for declining union memberships, I just think more people are waking up that they are no longer the necessity they once were.  Now that they have become the political powerhouse they are, when they only represent roughly 10% of the working population, is staggering to say the least.  They have too much clout for the amount of people they represent and they use it to throw their weight around and bully things into law.  There are also many grievances to be had with the corporations these days and their clout, I'm not ignoring that.  But you asked about unions."

LintPlastic,pornfree,1390441910.0,"Of course you're helping people. It is truly amazing what you are doing. Men and women both need to understand how porn takes you over and makes you forget the true beauty of things. I started hating porn when ever the person I loved stop having sex with me but kept watching it... It was so painful and though promised it'd never come in between us or break us apart it did... though he'd never admit. Because his addiction blames him to what porn did. And more men need to come OUT and explain how the addiction makes you believe you have no addiction. I may not be making sense... but

Yes I do hope more people opening their eyes. But, the war against porn is HUGE and most likely wont be won but may open bunch eyes to its harm!

IntellegentIdiot,coys,1390441918.0,"It happens all the time, to fit the agendas people have. Last season we were all aware how stupid it was that people thought we were a one-man team and yet fans are falling over themselves to repeat that because it suits the narrative that AVB was really bad all along, rather than admit we had slightly bumpy start thanks to trying to integrate 7 new players.

There was a great article on Football365.com that debunked some of the stupid anti-AVB arguments. One of them was a stat about Adebayor that basically said that AVB had little choice but to drop him based on his contributions.

What's sad is we don't know what goes on behind the scenes but people are happy to believe all kinds of rumours and repeat them as fact. I'm not sure anyone has officially said Adebayor was even asked to train with the youth team and if so, whether there was any justification for it. Perhaps he did something that warranted it."

sleuthoftrades,short,1390441933.0,"Yes, this is true. I often hear my tall friends talking like the OP, ""getting pussy"", ""smashing bitches"", etc - and they still hook up frequently. So, not talking like this isn't going to give you any significant advantage. However, that sort of advice kind of falls along the ""avoid night clubs"" kind of advice. Just as tall men can get away with counting on night clubs to hook up, they can also get away with talking like the way /u/littleln advises you not to. Its an unfortunate truth that the tall height advantage allows people to do things short men cannot do.

As for actual advice: dress for your body type (fitted, avoid stripes, slim pants), better posture (tall men are more likely to get away with a slouched posture), and keep the topic off of height as much as you can in conversations.

Also, you may wanna address you thread to the men of the subreddit. By the tone of your post, that was what you were going for anyway."

"
illadelchronic,bodyweightfitness,1390442505.0,"Well there's a number of factors happening on this sub that lead to questions being answered with ""read the FAQ""  

* We have a lot of complete fitness noobs.  Many folks just getting started don't want to do it in front of others.  This means no personal trainers (for better and for worse).  This means they don't have a fitness knowledge base.  At all.  They need to learn at least the basics.  Many many questions asked are simple questions that are covered in the FAQ.  Reading the FAQ answers their question, but will most likely answer 12 other questions they had that weren't asked.  
* There is a very incorrect understanding of bodyweight workouts.  As in stronger = 1,000 push ups.  With a barbell, no one would consider 1,000 bench reps at 55lbs to be progress, but they do with push ups.  This idea needs to be corrected.  Reading the FAQ answers their question, but will most likely answer 12 other questions they had but didn't realize yet.  
* There are a lot of gimmicky workouts out there.  Especially ones that purport to have the perfect solution that you can do at home with no equipment.  Many folks pick one as their starting point and then come to us and ask if its a good workout.  The workouts are frequently missing some of the basic principles of a good routine, like say a push/pull balance or realistic rep schemes or they are circuits plans making strength claims or or or.  Or several concepts that the FAQ goes into.  Reading the FAQ answers their question, but will most likely answer 12 other questions they had that weren't asked.  
*  There's a lot of terribly worded questions that leave many, many important details out.  I typically assume that they don't actually know what would have been relevant information to share.  Reading the FAQ answers their question, but will most likely answer 12 other questions they had that weren't asked.  

I try to answer questions as I'm pointing a finger at the FAQ, but so so frequently the questions are VERY prominently answered in the FAQ.  And the only conclusion I can come to, is that they lack some basics and Reading the FAQ answers their question, but will most likely answer 12 other questions they had that weren't asked.  

And as in all walks of life, some people just have resting bitch face about helping and others don't.  Its a risk you take asking internet strangers questions.  

Also this post occurs about every 3-4 months."
iAtlas,tall,1390442516.0,what part of missoura you from anyways?
gyroda,AdviceAnimals,1390442519.0,"Someone copied a programming assignment of mine once, literally copied and pasted and with a few variables changed (imagine getting a maths assignments and just switching x and y to a and b).

Turns out our home folders on the Linux machines are visible to anyone in the department. They did not tell us this, less than half of the students I spoke to about it knew. My username starts with an 'a', so I guess that's why it was *my* work they copied.

I got away with a warning for having my work publicly visible, I probably should have contested it but I was shitting myself for months and was happy to not lose any marks. I don't know who the guy who copied me as, but I hope he got what he deserved. OP, by the standards of my university you have done wrong by sharing your work. Some tips for the future:

Are you using any advanced formatting? If not, try using Google Docs. My uni use Google Calendar and GMail, so I just use my university email. This has a built-in revision history with account names. Makes it very clear who's work it was. I also use a revision-keeping tool whenever I code (git). Even if you don't write it on Google docs consider uploading it regularly to Google Drive or Dropbox or something, online storage services tend to have a ""document created on"" date.

Read your work, know every single piece of info. This is what proved my innocence. I knew what piece of code was redundant, but my reasoning for having it there. I knew why I had an odd layout quirk (two statements to a line) and could explain that. I could show that I'd labelled it sensibly, I could argue for the logic of it. In your case I would say know the sources, any details about how you found them, any quirky sentences that you just couldn't get into a more elegant form.

Show people your work, but *never* send it. If they have a copy you've done something wrong according to the rules of all the universities that I know of. If they need help, you can either send them a couple of sources, give them verbal guidance or show it to them on your computer making sure they don't get any alone-time with it. 

If possible work on the university machines, they'll have ""document created on"" and ""last modified"" dates. Not the best evidence but it's worth something. Less practical for word documents and the like, but for my coursework I try and run it on the university server. I know they make regular backups so if need be I can challenge them to check the backups for earlier versions of my work.

Not gonna lie OP, you were stupid to provide this guy with a copy of your work. This is going to be damage control rather than saving your grade/record, you *will* be disciplined in some manner. Good luck in proving that you wrote it, don't make the same mistake again and inform others this so they don't do the same if the guy asks for help from them."

If you are really worried about back-light bleeding, then generally you do need to stay away from any reasonably priced IPS monitors.  This basically leaves you with cheap 1080p monitors, which I cannot recommend because of the low pixel density, or high end professional monitors (ASUS PB278Q, Dell U2713hm etc.)  These will be quite outside your price range however, so you need to reevaluate what you want in a monitor."

People with ADD, and I'm arguing that BPD is a very close cousin, seek to self-stimulate brain activity when bored, and studies show that drama increases just that. Other things include negative thoughts. Basically, as borderlines know, we are dramatic because we feel things that way, and maybe, because we just want things to be dramatic, possibly to increase brain activity.


This also closely gets at what can be the cause to, generally and loosely speaking, anxiety disorders, ADD, and BPD: an overactive mind, aren't some of the drugs to treat both ADD and BPD and anxiety disorders anticonvulsants, including some which encourage GABA, the neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity?"

&gt; Government control should rely on the consent of the governed. Implicit in that statement is that the people should have the government outgunned.

You totally don't, though. Maybe in terms of sheer numbers of weapons, yes. But in terms of actual firepower you are hopelessly, laughably outgunned. Fire all the small arms rounds you want at an Abrams, it's not going to do shit.

The thing protecting Americans from some sort of feared military dictatorship is not that you all have handguns or shotguns or hunting rifles. It's that your military is made up of thinking individuals with civilian friends and family of their own, who would be none too pleased at being ordered to turn said vastly superior firepower on American citizens."

You have to train yourself to read with the goal being that you have certain questions you want to answer, not just about what happened, but also about why it is important or controversial.

A related point is to learn how to take notes, both when you are reading and listening. Most people try to take extensive notes and end up not covering all the material they need to cover because they are not efficient. Experiment with different methods and learn what works for you.

I basically got her to say ""I hope you do kill yourself"" on the day I set out on my first suicide attempt. I didn't make any type of contact with anyone for 4 days after that, which one can imagine what guilt she might've suffered through. 


I declared my love for her like a month after getting to know her and about three months after meeting her. We worked together for a total of 8 months also. We drank and danced after work, she gave me a key to her house to dog sit, and then kept inviting me over to spend the night (platonically). I'd also invested in the business she owned and helped her in other things. I would tell myself the only reason I'm so obsessive now is because I'm angry at being a creditor she defaulted on.

After the suicide thing, combined with other things, she  never wanted see me again. I later went to her house to ask about things I left there and money she owed me after she refused to coherently answer phone calls and texts. After that she called me from work (I'd gotten my job back, but no hours) after another round of only texts in which I said I'd try to ruin her business. Now, after two months of not seeing her I think today I'm finally decided to let her go, and that even the emails are bad, even if they are going to her trash file without her reading them.

Not even being glib.  Like, if you set aside all the romantic notions of what it means to be married, and actually get down to it and imagine yourself spending literally every waking moment with this person.  Chances are, they're going to be annoying sometimes.  That can't be helped, it's human nature.  The question you have to ask yourself is, do I love this person enough to not be annoyed by their annoyances?  If your answer is anything but a definite ""yes"", you may want to think a bit longer about getting married.

And while that might sound a tad... final, you really shouldn't go into a marriage with the attitude that if it doesn't work out, you can always get a divorce.  It's quite similar to how you should never get a tattoo while thinking ""oh, if I don't like it, I can just get it removed later.""  If the thought of getting a tattoo removed even crosses your mind, you should not be getting it.  Likewise, if you think there will ever be the slightest potential for divorcing this person, you should probably not be marrying them."

bowie747,Cricket,1390443744.0,"**The main difference between ODIs and tests (besides the time) is the ball**

The red ball used in tests stays hard for longer than the white ball used in ODIs which gets soft fairly quickly. This in turn means that the red ball bounces more, swings (deviation through the air) more, and cuts (deviation off the pitch) more. This means that batsmen have to be more cautious against the red ball, this also means that bowlers tend to bowl a bit shorter in tests, often aiming at the batsman's head to intimidate, and to make scoring difficult. This means that field placings are different in tests, not only to accomodate more conservative play, but also because batsmen hit the ball to different areas of the field due to where the ball is being bowled, which of course is due to the fact that the red ball deviates significantly for a long time in the game. 

Furthermore, when the red ball gets old (and a little soft), spinners are often used. The red ball also extracts more spin than the white ball, generally speaking, and so once again batsmen need to be more cautious. 

And, of course batsmen have the luxury of being able to play more conservatively due to the length of a test match (there is plenty of time to make a big score). A batsman can simply leave any non-threatening deliveries, this puts pressure on bowlers to be more incisive. In turn, batsmen in ODIs have the added pressure of not really being able to ignore non-threatening deliveries, as time is short. Test matches give batsmen an opportunity to construct an innings and score double or even triple-centuries, though this is rare, it is the ultimate goal. A test team *could* be as aggressive and score 280-320 in 50 overs and get bowled out, but a good test side can score 450+ on a good day. 350+ scores in ODIs are rare, but are becoming more frequent as younger generations of batsmen grow up learning how to score quickly. 

Basically, **time** and **type of ball** produce a variety of circumstances which influence each form of the game in different and unique ways. 


Edit: Pay attention to movement of each type of ball next time you watch both forms. You will notice that the red ball is threatening for a longer period of time, white balls go soft after around 10 overs. Also the red ball (if used skillfully) is more likely to *reverse swing* after 30-60 overs, which causes it to have a second wind, if you will, of being very dangerous. You will also notice that red balls fly off the pitch towards a batter, white balls tend to have a bit of pace taken off them after contact with the pitch. Test matches, for me, are truly beautiful things to watch, more than a sport, more than a leisure activity, something strong and beautiful. ODIs are more for sheer entertainment. I don't particularly care for T20s, they are scarcely a game of cricket. "

After he left, It slowly dawned on me that I'd gotten my staph from him, probably by drinking from his drink, and the way I reacted to that was basically as if I was raped.

twelvedayslate,AskReddit,1390444252.0,"I've asked myself that a lot. I've been asked that by others around me even more, and most of my friends probably assume I didn't really love him, but it was more of an obsession/addiction or something. But I really, truly did love him, within the first week of knowing him. I think it comes down to the fact that I was spiraling and just reeling after a traumatic event when I met him, so I threw myself into him and into a guy who I thought wanted me. Granted, he ended up making things worse eventually and making me feel more shitty, but he was my escape when we met. For the five years I was with him on/off, every time we'd be together (even if we weren't physically together), it was like we were in a bubble. The outside world just did not exist to me and he was just the center. Of course, that wasn't a good thing, but in the beginning of our relationship, it felt like it. 

And then there were other, smaller things. By the end, I loved him for the history we shared, because he was comfortable, because he knew me so well. I loved him because he made me laugh. I loved him because he was exciting and there's not one single person in the world like him (which, for the most part, is actually a good thing- he's not a very good person, but still. It was intriguing when we were together). I loved him because I was able to somehow just *know* when he was about to call me again, even after months. It's like I could feel him, but maybe that was just due to time. I loved him in a way that made me unimportant and made him so important though, and that was precisely why it was so unhealthy. 

For the record, I have a new boyfriend now, and I love him. It's a different type of love than the love for my ex. But for a long time after my ex (and even in our off periods), I would wonder if I could love again, or if I would constantly compare the two loves. This love is, by far and away, so much stronger, because it's so much better. There isn't an undercurrent of jealousy, anger, or resentment. It's just love. Neither of us use the word love to hold the other hostage or use it in a negative way against the other, ""But I thought you love me!"" If the love with my ex is a tainted pool, the love with my boyfriend is a crystal clear lake. "

The goal of such attacks was to separate behavior and speech from their political consequences, so that objections to everyday acts that enforce privilege and oppression would be seen as nothing more than a trivial protest over etiquette and hurt feelings.

""To invoke “political correctness” is really to be concerned about loss of power and privilege. It is about disappointment that some “ism” that was ingrained in our society, so much that citizens of privilege could express the bias through word and deed without fear of reprisal, has been shaken loose. Charging “political correctness” generally means this: “I am comfortable with my privilege. I don’t want to have to question it. I don’t want to have to think before I speak or act. I certainly don’t wish to inconvenience myself for the comfort of lesser people (whoever those people may be—women, people of color, people with disabilities, etc.)””

“The term politically correct is a reactionary term,” he said. “[It was] created by people who were worried by [social] changes…that affected their everyday understanding of the world in ways that pointed out their role in creating or reproducing dominance and subordination.”"

The other thing to do, if you're dealing with someone who doesn't use leg kicks (not unlikely with a wrestler), feed your hip, so they have a single rather than a double.

Here is a better rounded PC for more bang/buck.

* Changed CPU from 8350 to 8320 (Just overclock to the speed of the 8350, save some $$)
* Changed motherboard to a cheaper alternative.  (990 Chipset still rocks and I'm a firm believer that your motherboard shouldn't be 1.5x as expensive as your CPU)
* Changed RAM to 8GB DDR3-1600 because that's all you need.
* Changed PSU to a Corsair CX600M (good brand, semi-modular, gets the job done.)
* Added an optical drive because you didn't have one. Take it out if you don't want it "

caddph,magicTCG,1390444608.0,"When you play a creature with 'Tribute X' comes onto the battlefield, your opponent is given a choice: Allow the creature to get X +1/+1 counters (i.e. pay the tribute) OR if they choose to not allow the creature to get the +1/+1 counters, then it allows the creature's triggered ability to resolve.

For example you play [Strike Harpy](http://forums.mtgsalvation.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=151641&amp;d=1390428445). Your opponent can: Place two +1/+1 counters on it (making it 4/4) OR if they choose to not do so, the second ability will resolve, allowing you to have an opponent to sacrifice a creature.

A lot of people don't like 'tribute,' as it gives your opponent a choice, but in many cases you either get a really strong creature, or a decent creature combined with a spell of somesort.

Edit: The official rules (as listed in the [release notes](http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/faq/bng)) are as follows:
&gt;702.103. Tribute

&gt;702.103a Tribute is a static ability that functions as the creature with tribute is entering the battlefield. ""Tribute N"" means ""As this creature enters the battlefield, choose an opponent. That player may have this creature enter the battlefield with an additional N +1/+1 counters on it.""

&gt;702.103b Objects with tribute have triggered abilities that check ""if tribute wasn't paid."" This condition is true if the opponent chosen as a result of the tribute ability didn't have the creature enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters as specified by the creature's tribute ability."

goundo,AppalachianTrail,1390444700.0,"You could try to find a buddy. But I wouldn't count on it. Lots of people find hiking partners to start their thru, but you aren't starting during that time. The chances that someone else is looking for a hiking partner for that section at that time are not terrible, but not great, either. If you do get someone, they will probably be coming along for a smaller or slightly offset section. Whiteblaze also has a sub for finding hiking partners.

Safety isn't really an issue. Just don't fall off the mountain. It doesn't sound very hard, and it is easier than it sounds. As for company, a buddy could be a plus. But I would imagine there will still be plenty of people on the trail during that period for small sections or weekends. If nothing else, you get to be lonely in the woods, which isn't really a happy experience, but it is an experience we rarely have. I think this makes the experience worth having in its own right.

As for getting out, the hitch would probably be pretty easy. The best way would be to strike up some conversations with people who are hiking the same direction as you. Get friendly with a weekender who is ending where you are, and they will probably be headed in about your direction, and would be happy to give you a ride. Next best is walking up and talking to people in the parking lots. Fontana Dam and Newfound Gap are going to be bustling in June, since it is the high season. Make yourself look both presentable and pitiful, and after an hour or two of asking around (tops) you'll probably have a ride. Sticking out your thumb works too, but is less reliable than asking people directly, since they will trust you more once they have heard you speak. They will also be more sympathetic."

Why do you think that is? This is a very delicate and *deep* issue, and I understand why you feel contempt.

Here's a fact: **racism still exists blatantly and hugely in the United States.** I mean, heck, you can't even get a post on reddit that happens to include a black guy without 1000 comments mentioning not the subject of the picture but the black person.

Should we really just say, ""Hm. You know what? Blacks make up 13% of our population and 50% of our prison population. That must mean that blacks are stupid, evil, and crazy."" Of course not! There are so many things we must delve into before we make that assertion.

1.) **Just 60 years ago, blacks were forced, and I mean *forced*, to live in abject poverty.**

That's right! Laws blatantly segregated the majority from the minority. Which do you think had better schools? Better libraries? Which one do you think lived in the ghetto? The rulers or the oppressed? A black individual in 1950 with all the money in the world could not move into a white suburb. So where was he to go? Him, and the rest of his race (all confined to squalor), resided in the ghetto. The slums, too. 

So, just like that, segregation is abolished. Done. Overnight. But is it *really* overnight? Did blacks pack their bags the next day and just waltz over to the neighborhoods of their white counterparts and say, ""Hey, guys! Mind if we move in?"" No, of course not. Not only could they not afford it (because of the poverty they were forced into by white people), but racism still existed everywhere.

2.) **We've now come to the conclusion that blacks were basically subjugated into poverty (via white policies enacted 60, 70, 80+ years ago).**

This means that their schools, libraries, and lives were basically void of quality. If there's one thing you take from this entire thing, it should be this: if you aren't taught morals such as kindness, pleasantness, resourcefulness, and general goodwill to others, **you don't learn them magically.**

How is a kid in the ghetto (and they're all black because of policies that subjugated them into squalor 60 years ago, remember?) supposed to know not to steal? Hell, how did you learn that stealing is immoral? Your parents, your school, all of those things taught you not to steal. Well, these kids don't have those things. 

I'm sorry your things were stolen. Bad deal all around."

So here is how I'd approach it:  
  
1. for each type of field that you need to manipulate write the formula/code to a function/subroutine and return the adjusted result 
2. Write a function that loops through the input document, selects an appropriate calculation to perform on each data point and stores all of the results in a variable

And you really may be on to something with the height of the people who will say that, I haven't paid much attention.  I've always wondered if it's just because the men here don't want to seem like hypocrites by admitting that short women are too short for them or something.  My other theory is that women are just more aware that the reason they're not attracted to someone is because of height, while men simply only notice girls of average height and don't realize there's some girls they don't see who need love too haha."

anfee_,AskMen,1390445482.0,"The one thing that I don't see being mentioned, and sorry yes I'm a woman, is that BIRTH CONTROL IS NOT 100%!!!  

I am in no way ready to have children, I am on birth control (I have the implanon - slow release hormone implant in my arm) and even with this there's still a small percentage chance I could get pregnant - much less than the 97% protection percentage of the pill (if taken at the same time every day, and no external factors affecting it)  and I still use condoms. Until I'm ready to deal with getting pregnant I'm not having sex without them. My backup if the condom breaks is the birth control. 

So to summarise, sure that's fine, but make sure you discuss what you expect to happen if the birth control doesn't work and you get her pregnant, because you may not be ready for a baby, but she may not content to an abortion then where will you be?

epicaoblivion,asktransgender,1390445796.0,"Okay, ready yourself for the best story ever.

I have three transguy friends, (We are the four muskequeers, as they say) A, B, and C. We all go to boarding school, and two of them live on the same hall as me (B &amp; C).

I met A at the new student orientation the summer before I started school here. I didn't realize he was trans, but I figured he was instead a lesbian because of the haircut and the clothing. Fast forward to the school year, and I realize he's trans.

We become friends. We share similar friends. Around this time, friend B wasn't out yet. He kept saying things like, ""I want to cut my hair short."" and we'd all reply with ""But you'd look like a guy!"" and he'd reply with ""I know,"" but it never clicked.

Friend B had a mental breakdown, went to the mental hospital, then came back and came out to everyone as a he. It took a lot of adjusting, but our friend group finally got it down.

Friend A was so sweet, and loved by the entire student body pretty much. He was recognized mostly for being trans, but also for his amazing attitude.

Flash forward to graduation of last year. My dad re-met friend A (the first time being that orientation day), and my dad was rather rude once we were away from him, claiming things like ""She's not actually a boy.""

I was beyond upset, and this argument continued frequently, and because of this, I was depressed for most of the summer. I didn't realize at the time, but this year, I realized I was trans.

Friend C went here a few years back, but came back this year, and he along with friends A &amp; B are all out and people rarely misgender them. It's quite the experience. Because of their openness, I began to question myself more and more, and eventually I learned through them that I was trans. The first person I came out to IRL was friend A. He is the greatest guy I know.

EDIT: Friend A won Winter Formal King last semester. Just wanted to throw that in."

That said, poor posture can lead to injury and muscle pain. It may or may not be a result of your breasts. I did notice a lot of relief after getting and wearing bras in my size, but there is still a lot of ache 24/7.

speedisavirus,todayilearned,1390445827.0,"I like that you are asking this question so I'll answer it. I grew up in Delaware (2nd smallest state) and traveled to other states. 

Until I was 18 I had never traveled further north than Lake Ontario, 360 miles or the distance from Paris to Frankfurt. Furthest south was North Carolina which is about the same distance, and furthest west was West Virginia so add on maybe another 60-70 miles in distance to the other destinations. 

So lets call that a 400 mile radius circle just to average it out. Lets say its a half circle since the other half would be the ocean. That's a circle I'm guessing to be a little bigger than France. As an adult I've traveled the entire distance of the continental US as well as some Europe, Mexico, Canada, and Southwest Asia but...

Consider all of Europe excluding Russia's part fits in the US. Including the Russia part then it isn't that much bigger, like 200,000 sq miles bigger or the size of about Utah. someone in the US that has traveled the US well could have traveled to a dozen or more countries in Europe. I personally find the diversity around the country to be significant enough that I don't need to travel to a foreign land to see something new and different but I still do it. 

What I am glad that the OP's article mentioned is that, for someone in the US, traveling to Europe or Asia is really expensive. For a single person we are talking a $3000 vacation or more. If you include the family tack on about $1000-$2000 per person for the flight. So, assuming a single fella traveling alone making the median US income, about $35,000, that would be approximately 2.25 pay checks pre tax. Post tax make it about 3 pay checks. Start adding family and it could be 1/4 to 1/3 a year's pay. 

Another factor, though I didn't see it mentioned in the article, is that an US worker is not guaranteed any vacation. I'd say the average person from my recollection gets maybe 1.5 weeks a year. Some get more depending on their career. I get about a month but I also have a high demand career and make significantly more than the median income for a single earner. Some get none at all. 

If I am that 1.5 week a year person making $35,000 a year with a wife and 2 kids do I expend the resources and expend my vacation for a week in Europe? Probably not. 

My question to a European is, is there a negative connotation to Europeans that never leave Europe? 

EDIT: Size of area of travels."

About 40 minutes after I sent that email and I was resting peacefully in my can my bitch of a NCOIC came storming in and screamed so loud she woke up the four cans around me. She was mad because I sent an email to him and she did not authorize me to send anything to the Commanders that was not operationally important. This was like 5pm local time as well, not 2am or some weird time. 

The kicker: She was upset because she was secretly stealing all of the things that the 3 of us (SSgt, 2 SrA) were doing so she could build a Dec Package for 332AEW that would get her a Bronze Star since we were literally starting the Air Force's mission at this location outside of CAS.

* **For atheists:** Have you ever put any extra thought into what may have created all existence? Do you know for certain that there is no force beyond our knowledge and understanding that created the universe and established the processes of development over time just because there is no sign of it? 

Of course, I only actually use these questions to defend my agnostic reasoning if I am questioned about it.

I don't have an issue with that being his preference, but to have that be the sole reason you break up with someone? Tis a bit hard. "

twelvedayslate,AskReddit,1390446019.0,"Wow, that's crazy that your sister had a similar story! Fortunately, I never involved anyone between me and my ex. All of my friends hated him. I'm pretty sure all of his friends either didn't know about me or didn't particularly care for me. Then again, they were probably all too drunk to know. You know how frat guys are :)

You know, I'm really not sure why he stayed with me. I know why I stayed with him. But as for why he stayed with me? Hmm. It's still a mystery to me. I think in some ways, I was a security blanket for him. I was always there (which was one of my faults). I think he took comfort in knowing how much I cared for him. At the same time, underneath it all, I think in some ways, I was important to him. He had a lot of girls go in and out in the time I was with him (yes, he cheated a lot, left me for other girls, etc.), but no girl ever stayed as long as I did. And I don't just mean that in the sense the girls couldn't handle him, but he couldn't handle the other girls for as long as he handled me. So yes, I know that I was important to him for some reason or another. 

My ex and I don't talk anymore. Quite simply, we can't talk. Sometimes when easing in from one of our off periods, we would attempt the whole ""friends"" thing. It would last maybe an hour. There was just too. much. between us. And I don't mean history, but chemistry, feelings, etc. Even ten, twenty years from now, I know we won't be able to be friends. Then again, I truly don't like who he is as a person (and I would have said that when we were together), so I wouldn't want to be friends with him. We also don't have mutual friends, though, so unless a one in six billion chance occurs, I could never run into him.

Unfortunately, no, we never had cleaner breaks. We were explosive in the beginning, explosive in the end. All of our break ups were explosive. We were truly horrible for each other in every sense of the word. I can't count how many mean things we would say to each other in the break ups, which usually involved him leaving me and saying abusive things, and me pleading for him to say (ugh, that sounds pathetic). There is not one reason why we should've even been together for five days, let alone on and off for five years. I don't even remember what caused our ultimate and final demise. I think we were both over it. Our relationship had run its course. But it wasn't clean. It involved a lot of fighting, a lot of tears from my end, and the pain was very intense, even though I *knew* we just had nothing left."

mandym347,sex,1390446260.0,"&gt; What I want to know is how can we increase his sex drive?

One thing that comes to mind is to decrease his stress.  If he's coming home tired and irritated, that's nothing to do with you.  If he's putting time in reading or playing online, that could be just shutting his brain off and decompressing from the day, not expressing a preference over you.  In fact, you might be personalizing the situation too much.  You don't seem to be the problem at all, and that's a hard thing to wrap your head around.  I know this personally; my husband had back pain plus a lower libido.  I've struggled quite a bit with the ""not good enough"" mentality and finally had to deal with the fact that it wasn't me.  It really wasn't me.  It felt great to let that go and concentrate on making it easier for him to get into the mood."

terabyte06,NoStupidQuestions,1390446566.0,"&gt; Can I get ADSL and still connect wirelessly? 

Yes.  

ADSL is the link between your house and your ISP.  ADSL uses regular telephone line, where Cable uses coax cable (like a TV).  

Both require a modem, which takes the signal from the telephone line or the coax, and converts it to a network jack (Ethernet) that you're used to.  

To get Wi-Fi, you just plug a wireless router into that modem and connect your devices to it.  Some modems have the capabilities of a wireless router built in, but you'll have to ask your ISP.  "

They know that my dating situation has really made my life hard in some aspects and that it's really taken a toll on me.  They always offer to help but never have been able to pinpoint why I'm undateable.  The reason I got so sucked into reddit is actually because I got fed up with my friends telling me I was perfectly normal on all counts and thought that strangers would be more objective and less afraid of hurting my feelings by telling me what the problem is.  No dice.


Yes, I would cry if people started naming every flaw I have, but I think it would be less sad in the long run than what I experience now.  I'd be willing to feel shitty for a week or so if it led to me identifying a problem, fixing the problem, and moving past this point in my life."

But they were moderates compared to today. Eisenhower helped build the interstate and warned of the military industrial complex and Nixon established the EPA and had some pretty decent ideas that would never stand the litmus test of the party today. Quite frankly, today's democrats are yesterday's republicans.

I'm in my 20s. Majored in political science in college, which might impact my perspective as well, but the current GOP is just a mess.

My brother had severe issues with Sprint to the point my mother intervened... which led to my grandfather joining in and threatening his attorneys on them before they got the fucking hint. 

My brother is in the NAVY and always paid his bills on time and just before he went out to sea he did everything he was supposed to to terminate his plan and deactivate his phone, he also had privileges or something or other because he was military. 

Well, fast forward a few months later and he gets this thick envelope from Sprint (he had his mail delivered to us because he has no permanent address,) and our mother opens it (she had special permission from my brother) and it is this wad of paper: copies of their bullshit contracts and pages and pages of bills for failing to deactivate his phone properly, not paying early termination (which he did, and our mother had the check stub to prove it), and all these other outrageous fees for piddly-shit that it, seemed, they tacked on just because. 

She called them, with paperwork in hand that my brother gave to her, but Sprint didn't care, saying their records show he didn't do anything he was supposed to. Oh this was after they fought with her saying they couldn't speak to her and despite her trying to explain they couldn't speak to my brother as he was in the middle of the ocean somewhere. 

Well, she finally knocked some sense into Sprint so they would finally acknowledge her existence, but they wouldn't budge despite the fact she had my brothers paperwork from when he terminated his plan. So she put Sprint into contact with our grandfather who then put them in contact with his attorneys.

She's responded really well to it and uses it a lot during the day. We keep it in the kitchen and it's become really useful. I love cooking and finding new recipes and ideas online - but taking the laptop into the kitchen is silly and awkward. The ipad is ideal for this purpose, it's light, small, wipeable and the battery life is superb. I attribute in no small way my renewed enthusiasm for home-cooking to that iPad. Before, if I wanted to whip up a quick sauce or figure out what flavours go well with what I have fridge, I'd have to go upstairs and scribble something down or print it off - I wouldn't bother 9 times out of 10. Now I save everything I find to Pocket and I'm looking up ideas all the time. The result is interesting, healthy meals every single day. Also, as a family who have sit down dinners every night, we talk a lot about the news and the world, and often we'll reach for the iPad after we're done eating to share something related to the conversation, which has resulted in some great discussions that have brought us together as a family.

geddup_noise,AskReddit,1390446915.0,"Learn the value of a dollar. My father always used this metaphor:

Imagine you don't have a job anymore. There's no money in your bank account, you don't have the promise of a paycheck next week, there's no credit cards either. You just plain don't have any money. Kind of like a homeless person. 
Remember when you were a kid and 'a dollar' was a fortune? I remember getting a shiny loonie and cherishing it like it was solid gold. 
Now put yourself in that situation. Be it a kid, or a homeless person. 
How do you get your hands on a dollar?
Just one dollar? You can't just go get one, can you? Sure with a bank account and a credit card you spend dozens of them. Hundreds, even. Every day. But now, you don't have any of that. You can't just ""Get"" a dollar. Go ahead and try it. Are you willing to panhandle? Steal? You'd have to work for it, right?
At my current job, It takes me in the area of about 4 minutes to make a dollar. 4 minutes of work. My time is worth something. Would I give up 40 minutes of my day to buy something that costs ten dollars? Or four hours for something that costs $60? Would you skip ahead four hours of the clock and make it bedtime or the next day or what have you for that item? Now, if I wanted to buy something with the money I made at that job, I ask myself a couple of questions: 

1) Do I NEED this thing? Or do I just want it? (This doesn't mean only buy bread and water, but say you see that Star Wars knife stand on amazon, sure it looks cool, but can you justify spending $89.95 on it?)

2) Would I be willing to WORK for the time it would take to earn the cost of this in exchange for it? (i.e. Say you make $10/hour, would you work for 9 hours in exchange for that Star Wars knife stand? At the end of a very long day your boss hands you not a paycheck but a useless thing?)

3) If someone offered you a choice between the thing you want to buy, and the cash it takes to buy it, which would you take? (Someone puts $90 cash in front of you, and the knife stand. Do you take the knife stand?)

Think about how good it feels to have extra money around. Want that feeling. Love that feeling. Learn that money is literally value in physical form. It is power. Use it responsibly, use it wisely. You are an adult. You have the mental capacity to make good decisions. It's not easy, but it's possible.

I'm not sure if any of that applies to you personally, but I use it, my family used it, It seems to work.

sleuthoftrades,AskMen,1390447007.0,"Just barely 5'7''. It has been a problem. A lot of my friends are in the 6'0''+ territory and you can definitely see how much of advantage they have when you all go out to the bars/clubs. 

Girls I have gotten with resulted out of hanging out friendship. Every single one has been shorter than me. As far as I know, there has been no ""lust at first sight"" directed towards me - and I attribute it to my height. That may not seem like a big deal to a lot of people, but it is significant to me as a young man. I am not looking forward to dating older women, even if they decide to settle and ""look past the physical"". I otherwise work out, dress well, act politely, and keep up interesting hobbies. However, I am convinced that 5'' more inches would have a profound influence on my life (perhaps more so than any other trait; I am of an ethnic minority and my father has a high paying job, I would give up both to be 6'). Sad to see friends who otherwise do ""not keep up appearances"" get byes just for being 5'' taller - neither of us chose that attribute.

As I see it, being short hasn't prevented me from getting laid outright, but it has had a significant detriment to my life in that field. People may say they want to go against the gender role normative rules towards dating, but it is an uphill battle.

GeorgeofJungleton,AskMen,1390447065.0,"1) Online dating is a numbers game, your profile is a CV and the first date is the interview, profiles are generally written to appeal to as many people as possible and particularly not to say anything that would stop someone from responding.

2) A thousand ""No""s and one ""Yes"" is still a yes, If they send a hey to enough people it is likely some will take a look and so increase the likelyhood of they taking a liking to their profile. It's raising brand awareness.(also they may  luck out and hit someone looking for casual sex which is a certain proportion of people in those sites)

3)Maybe they are mean/unintelligent/strange, such people exist and have access to the internet too.

4)The photos don't appeal to you but they may well work for someone else, I have a few friends that someone photoshopped to look like a zombie if done well would increase their likelihood of responding. As for poor quality photos it is likely they were taken with a webcam at the moment because they didn't think to look for a decent picture.

5)A car tells you a lot about a person, how much they make, their prioritizing of practicality/power. If someone has a pickup truck that tells you something different to if they had an Audi. Even if the viewer doesn't realise it they will likely make some judgement of the person based on the car.

6)They may not be intentional, personally there are several photos of me with women on my profile but that's just because they are friends and it happens that when I'm out with my women friends they tend to take better photos. On the other hand it may be intentional to show ""look I'm safe and not a hater/hunter of women, these women think so!"" and it may be studies consistently show that men as perceived as more attractive when the subject is told they are in a relationship."

bigt252002,AirForce,1390447168.0,"Apologize if this is long, its an in depth topic. I've sat on a MAJCOM board. What area are you up for (AMN, NCO, Sr NCO, etc)? Is this AFSC specific or are you the rep for your Wing? 

The things we asked were not so much about current events, and definitely not what your opinion is of something at the AMN or NCO level either. They don't care if you have negative, or even positive, connotations about any of that. We asked questions in regards to what they believed to be the best parts of the Air Force, What changes do they believe would be for the betterment of the entire branch. 

But for the most part, we tailored it to the what we saw in the package to begin with. 90% of the time, we already had a decent idea on who we thought it was going to be based on the bullets alone. I can tell you right now that what you did for your job is rarely looked at as more than a grain of salt. The reason behind that is everyone does something different. If you're doing one in your AFSC, that is a different story...but for WING/MAJCOM type awards where you're going up against MDG/MSG/MXG/OG/AW members, it is too hard to equate what they've done in comparison and we all know management exaggerates what their person did because they are obviously their person (and they use it for their awards later on). So that leaves us for equal footing in the ""Self-Improvement"" and ""Volunteer Efforts"" as the biggest deciding factors. 

I know that it sad to read, but there is a major difference between someone who volunteered to caddy at the base's sponsored golfing event and someone who was running the entire AADD program for a base. One person is probably doing it because they were told to do volunteer work and the other wants to do something that makes them feel like they are doing something. That is when we start asking leadership questions and we start drilling the caddy person on what their idea of a day is. You'd be surprised how many in that caddy scenario would say ""get up, play videogames, get lunch, go for a run, study for a test"" and that was literally their day. We had some who lied and then we just start down that path to out their lie. Same with education level. Some of my colleagues were very hard up on the CCAF, others of us looked at where they were in a Bachelors Degree and what that was in. We all know that undergrad credits are going to count for a CCAF as well, so who cares. Were they taking education and self improvement to the betterment of themselves and for hopefully the Air Force? We will ask questions like ""why did you pick Psychology?"" ""what do you plan on doing with your degree in Liberal Arts?"" ""What has been your favorite class and why?"" The whole point is get an idea of how motivated the person is and if they are just taking the cakewalk or if they are pushing themselves. 

So, just bare that in mind as you go into the interview. You already know how to dress and you know the reporting statement crap so you're golden with it. If they start asking you a lot of questions, you are probably one of them that they are on the fence about out of all the packages they are reviewing. The harder the questions, the more they are trying to determine between 2 or more people. Try to relax and answer the questions as best you can. If you need a second to think of the answer, just tell the party ""That is a fantastic question Sir/Ma'am, may I please have a minute to gather my thoughts to better articulate my answer"" and then answer it. They will probably ask questions in regards to if you witness someone in violation of an AFI. They may even throw you a curveball with the black socks or any color tennis shoe in PT Gear since it is in the new reg. Unless you are at the management level though, they are not going to ask your opinion on the new EPR format, what you think about the SARC mission, or what changes to the Fitness Test should be made. Everything should be scenario based to see your understanding of the Air Force culture and your leadership qualities to adhering to standards and regulations as the Air Force has mandated. 

Work stuff will matter, but like I said as a grain of salt. They'll ask some fun questions in regards to what you to, but remember most of the people on a MAJCOM board that is non AFSC specific probably has no damn clue what you really do. So they may ask for elaboration on whatever that may be. Try to think of a way to explain in layman terms if you have a weird job that many people ask you 100000 questions on outside of your shop. If they see a bullet in there like ""created 5 headline stories for local base news, selected by af.mil on 2"" or something...they may ask you what those articles were and how you felt about them being selected. But think about it, if you're in PA and that is your bullet and you're up against a PJ who has a CSAR mission out in Mt. Hood because 20 hikers were lost....who is winning that?? The whole goal is to keep it as equal as possible with the job part, but making sure they were doing something well above their paygrade still. We get that by asking questions, and even what your goals are for yourself in the AFSC. 


Sorry this is a novel

tl;dr: Relax and don't be afraid to tell them you need a second to think of an answer. Just don't do it every question."

Compulsory education and a good education system that provides free, effective instruction to all citizens does more for the citizens than it does for the government. An educated citizenry is harder to control, and takes control of more of their lives. Without education, a children's worldview would be shaped only by indoctrination, propaganda, and advertising. They'd have little ability to follow their dreams or forge their own path in life. They'd be sheep.

In short, education only adds. It does not take away. There is nothing that would prevent an educated person from retreating from modern society to live off the land. The knowledge gained throughout childhood does not preclude a person from making a choice to ""opt-out"" when he/she is mentally capable of making autonomous decisions. On the contrary, good education practices encourage autonomous decision making and give individuals the tools to think and act for themselves."

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1390447329.0,"CHAPTER 32: Alright let's do this thing. Victory or Death.

I have enough room to bring along all of my shit-fuckers, even with Nils being force-deployed. I'm gonna break out my stat boosters this level, because why the fuck not?

I have 1 robe, 3 books, 2 wings, 1 icon, 2 shields, 2 talismans, the boots, and 2 body rings.

Florina: 1 Body Ring, 1 Dracoshield
Nino: 1 Body Ring
Priscilla: 1 Angelic Robe
Dart: 2 Secret Books, 1 Talisman
Sain: 1 Secret Book, 1 Speed Wing
Oswin: 1 Speed Wing
Lucius: 1 Goddess Icon, 1 Dracoshield
Raven: 1 Talisman, The Boots

Raven's getting the boots because my Oswin isn't actually very good, which is kinda weirding me out to be honest.

After handing out all the loot I get to selling just all the things. Broken weapons, vulneraries, antidotes, pure waters, light runes, promotion items, chest keys, iron weapons, the lot.

Now I have to decide what way everyone's going to go. There are 3 routes through Victory or Death, and I like to clear them all at once.

Top is going to be spearheaded by Raven, Priscilla, and Lucius. Raven and Priscilla are going to be doing most of the killing, because Lucius is level 17 and has capped his magic, skill, and speed, jesus christ Lucius, slow down. With them goes Rebecca and Sain because why not y'know, it's not like they're gonna need the help.

Bottom route is going to be speaheaded by Dart and Farina. They're both pretty good at murdering things. I mean there are a bunch of archers towards the end there but I guess I can just give her a delphi shield. With them goes Nino, Canas, and Rath. Nino and Canas will be healing them and the middle route if they have time as well as killing things.

Middle Route is gonna be spearheaded by Hector, Oswin, and Florina. Florina's gonna be mostly hanging back cause she's level 15. She hasn't rammed into all of her offensive caps like Lucius has, but she's still pretty good at murdering shit with killing weapons. With them goes Eliwood and Lyn to be chummy with their lord buddy Hector, his wife, and his loyal retainer. Nils is gonna come with them too to uh. Be... there. I don't use dancers very much. It mostly just makes advancing through tight places really awkward. Merlinus will come too I guess. Florina can distribute weapons and shit.

Wow great thanks Fargus an Earth Seal not like I just sold one of those. Anyway straight away I change the plan and send Sain and Rebecca through the middle instead of Eliwood and Lyn because I just noticed the ballista.

There's a swordmaster with a wo dao in the middle which I originally assumed to be threatening - thankfully his stats against an axe-wielding Oswin read: Hit 51, Crit 30, Dmg 0.

Down bottom Farina is literally impossible to hit holding an iron sword, takes about 3 dmg from them anyway, and murders them back in 1 round. It cleans out pretty fast. Then Sophia mistakes Dart for the Archsage.

Up top Raven is knocked pretty low by a bunch of archers but my 2 best healers are up there so who even gives a shit. We get what must be the worst unit in the game from the ruins. Fucking 12 magic at level 16. Jesus christ.

Canas and Nino support a bit more and we learn about how awful Niime from FE6 is. They hang back to take care of the cav reinforcements that start to spawn because Farina, Dart, and Rath are bad motherfuckers who don't need no help.

The middle group got bogged down a bit by the sheer amount of indirect fire that pelts them, but the bottom group caught up and started killing, while the top group took out the indirects up there.

Then next turn a shit ton of reinforcements arrive, but Raven and Priscilla manage to get amongst them and neutralise the largest threats. Unfortunately more keep spawning next turn, so I end up having to bring up Canas and Nino as well as breaking up a lot of support pairs which makes me nervous. I make it through alright although Limstella's repeated bolting is starting to piss me off.

I have Raven crit down Limstella with the silver blade, while the rest of my units try and form into something resembling a defensive structure for all the reinforcements that have decided to start spawning again. Then once I finally set it up they decide to stop spawning. Dashed inconvenient of them. I end turn a few more times to see if they're going to spawn again, but they don't, so I seize.

That was fun. Most of my units are really getting up there, level wise, so I'm going to try to get Hector involved more.

Anyway this part of the game, story-wise, makes me sad I didn't pair Eliwood and Ninian, but this is an army of fighters. If you won't put down the damn lute and pick up a sword then you're no good to me.

FINAL CHAPTER: Hooo boy. Here it is. Jesus I only get 12 units and 5 of them are forced. That leaves me with 7 to pick. Uh...

Uh...

Okay, Florina and Oswin are coming to support Hector. Raven, Priscilla, and Lucius are coming because I trust them so much.

That leaves me with 2 to pick. I'll bench Rath because he doesn't have a support (sorry buddy, you were a good unit). As much as I want to take Canas because I haven't let him play with Luna, like, at all, I'm benching him and Nino because I already have a lot of magic users. The choice comes down to SainxRebecca or DartxFarina. Unfortunately for Rebecca (who destroys motherfuckers) Sain is really weighing her down. The only reason he wasn't benched a long time ago was his A-support with her. Dart and Farina, however, are lean, mean, killing machines, the both of them, and you need as many murder machines as you can get on this level.

Here's how we're kitted out:

Hector: Wolf Beil/Swordslayer/Silver Axe/Armads/Tomahawk
Eliwood: Silver Sword/Killing Edge/Killer Lance/Short Spear/Durandal
Lyn: Steel Bow/Killing Edge/Mani Katti/Wo Dao/Silver Sword
Athos: Forblaze/Divine/Bolting/Elfire/Fimbulvetr
Florina: Killing Edge/Killer Lance/Silver Lance/Spear/Lancereaver
Oswin: Axereaver/Silver Axe/Silver Lance/Hand Axe/Killer Lance
Farina: Killer Lance/Silver Lance/Brave Lance/Short Spear/Delphi Shield
Dart: Swordreaver/Silver Axe/Brave Axe/Killer Axe/Hand Axe
Priscilla: Physic/Thunder/Elfire/Silence/Warp
Raven: Silver Axe/Killer Axe/Silver Sword/Wyrmslayer/Swordreaver
Lucius: Aura/Aureola/Physic/Fortify/Berserk

Let's do it. Okay first turn: FUCK UHAI. I bolting crit him with Athos and send Priscilla over to deal with the snipers. Everyone else moves to take a door.

Kenneth's door opens and Farina kills the roadblock so Florina can take down the big guy. Kenneth is not very difficult.

Brendan's door opens. Farina moves back down into support range so Dart can crit him to death with the killer axe. He drops the silver axe to pick up basilikos.

Darin's door opens and it's painfully clear that Eliwood is not equipped to deal with him, while Lyn can't reach him. He gets a couple boltings to the face then Eliwood gets to clean up with Durandal. He drops his silver sword for the Rex Hasta - He'll probably give it to Oswin later.

Jerme and Ursula's door opens. My main shit-kickers - Lucius, Priscilla, and Raven - are down here. Lucius and Priscilla deal with Jerme, then Raven crits Ursula to death.

Lloyd and Linus's doors open. Hector, Florina, and Athos take down Lloyd (just), but Oswin from range and Athos' second turn from Nils don't manage to kill Linus, and he gets a potential kill shot on Florina. It misses cause she's awesome, but that was still scary. Oswin and Hector manage to take down the rest of his health next turn.

This reveals Nergal and friends, and I manage to get the sage silenced.

Then they beserk Raven, so I warp him up there and back off, supplying him with ranged heals.

I have to lure him away from the boss with Lucius (who he can't quite kill) but then he kills him next turn. I uh. I reload and silence the guy with the beserk staff this time.

I let Athos have a crack at his old friend then murder the boss with Dart's Basilikos.

Dart's really good you guys.

Anyway everyone with a weapon that's effective against it (read: Dart, Hector, Athos, Eliwood) Dogpiles the dragon with Lucius spamming the fortify staff. Hector grabs the final kill because this is hector mode, and Eliwood can get the hell out.

We get a bunch of fuzzy feelings, our dancers leave, and I get just the cutest image you guys. Florina sitting on Hector's shoulders. :3

Then we get to cut to the day before Hector and Florina's wedding and oh my god I'm so glad I made these two a couple.

Hector drops some foreshadowing for a game that came out before this one and we are finally, done.

MOST KILLS:
Hector: 109
Oswin: 93
Sain: 91

Hector is the only one of these units that deserves being in the top three, but I guess that's what you get from being in the prologue, Sain.

MVP is really easy. From the moment he joined he started kicking arse, and never stopped. Lucius. He capped fucking everything I don't even know how, and as part of a unit with Raven and Priscilla everything just sort of evaporated.

2nd place would be Florina - I had to hold her back at the end there, and the fact that she couldn't support with Oswin to get a real triangle going stifled her a bit, but I could always rely on Florina to get shit done.

A close, close third place would be tied between Rebecca and Farina. Farina was a peg knight who also had strength and defense. I was seriously confused. Then I paired her with Dart and they cleaned house. Rebecca would routinely solo hordes of melee units by dodging all of them then killing one at a time. Sain would be next to her pretending like the support bonus wasn't the only thing he was contributing.

Next time I really hope to actually use Fiora. It's a shame she turned out so badly, I love flying units in this game. I also wish Guy turned out better, but he never does, so I'm not surprised. I'm also probably going to use less magic users next time.

Hector mode I think is better than Eliwood's, but only because I played Eliwood's first. Late hector promotion hurts tho."

It's such a weird concept to think about. All the funerals you'll go to before your own. It's even weirder when a friend of your age dies. Its...surreal. A good friend of mine from hs (my first friend I made in middle schoool, and we were good friends till she graduated our junior year) passed away in december. It still feels, not real.

For scampi I have two recipes.

* Simple recipe is just melt a lot of butter and crowd the pan with the shrimptails and simmer until just underdone (cooking continues of course afterward).
* Fancy recipe is sear several garlic cloves in a little nearly-smoking clarified butter, add the shrimptails and sear a little more, lower heat and add a splash of dry vermouth and a squirt or two of lemon juice, braise briefly, plate up in the traditional deep-oval plates and fleck with (dried or) fresh flat-parsley.

Docent: A docent is a small metallic sphere, approximately 2 inches across, studded with gems. Artificers and warforged alike have so far failed to discover the secret of their construction. Despite a strong magical aura, a docent has no apparent abilities. Its powers are only revealed when attached to a warforged (occupying the same space as an amulet). At this point, a docent comes to life--literally. A docent is an intelligent magical item designed to advise and assist the warforged it is attached to. A docent doesn't follow the standard rules for determining alignment for intelligent items. However, it differs from normal intelligent items in other ways:
* A docent has an Intelligence of 2d6+8 (minimum 12) and Wisdom and Charisma scores of 2d6+6 (minimum 10).
* A docent perceives its surroundings by using the warforged's senses, but does not use the Search, Spot, or Listen skills of the warforged.
* A docent can always communicate telepathically with the warforged. Under normal circumstances a docent cannot speak, but a warforged can choose to give the docent direct control over its own voice.
* One of the primary purposes of a docent is to serve as a translator for its warforged. All docents speak Giant and Common. A docent can understand an additional two languages per point of Intelligence bonus. When a docent is discovered, it may not have filled all of these language slots."

Noneerror,worldnews,1390447913.0,"That case isn't relevant here. This wouldn't be infringing content and it has nothing to do with the DMCA. It would have to do with other laws. The ISP would see the data is originating at Netflix and take steps to throttle.

wakeonuptimshel,AskMen,1390447933.0,"Honestly? Yes, in my opinion. But I think we all assign a different level of value to different parts of a relationship. Just like we all have pet peeves, we all have different things that we want or that will bother us, and I just happen to find his to be unreasonable. 

You don't think it's a bit silly to say ""if you are not willing to have anal, I am going to dump you?"" Sex is incredibly important in a relationship, but so is personality and how the person makes you feel. I want to mean more to someone than a condom. 

Then again, in contradiction, I think it's understandable to end it with someone if they are not into the same kinks that you are. That's a bit more understandable to me because it is, to me, a lifestyle preference. It's not a ""this makes me feel better so it is my way or we are over,"" it's a ""this is what makes me feel."""

I'm doing my pre-med coursework, and it's frustrating to think that the money and time I'm putting into my goal to become a physician or ""Doctor"" is all for naught when an RN can go get her DNP and go around calling herself Doctor as well, even though she hasn't completed any residency, or fellowship, just classwork. I mean what's next, a doctorate of paramedicine? A Doctorate of Care Technicianing?

cfiggis,Sherlock,1390447983.0,"This is not untrue, however, my point is about the orchestration of the event itself. An assassin is going to have a vastly different vantage point than Watson. Most likely he's up in a window of one of the buildings, looking down. In other words, he's somewhere that he can see any sort of apparatus like an airbag or bungie cord or assistants setting things up.

So before you ever get to the point of Watson being a genuine mourner, the assassins have to be convinced that Sherlock's death was not faked. They therefore have to be the primary targets of Sherlock's ruse, not Watson."

add_problem,short,1390448041.0,"I appreciate your effort.  Maybe I'll fix this fucker for once and all.  I haven't really had a boyfriend, no.  I've gotten legit interest from four boys since the age of 13, I'm 24... 


The first one I turned down because I was an immature 13 year old girl and he had a lot of stuff to sort through.  We then proceeded to do this weird thing where we were friends and would flirt but it never went anywhere because he would then go and date one of my friends.  He's slept with one best friend and is now ENGAGED to my best friend of 20 years.  I think this one really fucked with my head because just as soon as I thought he was going to make a move or the very second I thought about telling him how I was feeling, he would go with someone else.  I think this has left me with an underlying sense that men are not interested.  That said, I had tons of guy friends in high school who all dated pretty much all of the other girls in our group of friends but me.


The second was in college.  We were never exclusive but I'll include him because I'd be lying if I said that this guy wasn't ridiculously into me, and things might have worked out if he hadn't had to leave for med school in another state.


The third was right after that.  We were nonexclusive for about a month and then he dumped me two weeks after I became his girlfriend for some other girl.  


Number four is a situation like number two, but he wasn't as into it as number 2 was.  He moved to NYC about two weeks after I met him.


I think my problem stands out to me more because my friends have all been the kind who are always dating someone and I was the only single girl in my group in college 99% of the time.  Pair that with the fact that I never had a date for prom, semiformal, or formal and it's enough to make me depressed."

Chunks1992,gaybros,1390448059.0,cheapest way is unbolt the hood from the car and repaint it yourself. there's usually a sticker on the driver door that has vehicle information and more often then not has a piant code on it. Go into your closest O'Reilly auto parts store about buy 2 or 3 cans of matching paint and clear coat. Before you paint over it though use paint remover to get the old nasty stuff off.

bunker_man,Christianity,1390448060.0,"The traditional christian position in many ways was opposed to abortion... but not on legal grounds. For most of the middle ages, up until relatively recently it was almost unthinkable to think such things could even be moderated by law. Most places barely if even had laws against after birth infanticide, which was a common practice even in the christian middle ages. (Yes, they tried to cut it down, etc, but that's different from laws.) That's the issue with talking about historical context. Some things might seem justified by being in a position whereby you do not yet have the social structure to do anything about it. Which means that stopping it involves arriving at the next level of social structure. As already happened with infanticide obviously. But will be a bit until it could happen for abortion. The reason it became big again of course is that the social structure was not yet advanced enough to solidify it last time they tried."

It's good practice to clean a bloody knife before you re-sheath it anyway, otherwise it rusts. He's constantly walking around with alcohol and rags - all you need to keep the infection off the blade.

These lines really struck a cord w me, it made me realize that if there is something wrong with how my life is going i need to identify it and change it, i am not emotional about this decision because is not based on my emotions, but rather on thoughts, i see no point in life anymore, not because things are going bad but because i have literally pushed myself to my outmost limits and have endured, i could set myself any goal because i know myself, my faults my qualities and there just seems to be no thrill in my life, i have no challenge that i feel will overwhelm me, i feel like a warrior w no war.

I went into law interested in politics, because in my idealistic mind i thought that the system is better changed from the inside, i want to not only change the world but make it better, yet at every turn in every conversation, is not life or enemies that hamper my advance, is the same people that im trying to help and convince to work for a better future.

I have lost my faith in humanity, and since i have no faith in a god, i simply dont know what to fight for anymore, what to work for anymore, i feel heartbroken, like any work that i do to better my surroundings will be for nothing, because i am the only one who wants to better those surroundings."

ProffieThrowaway,AskAcademia,1390448216.0,"When you search for articles in the library database, they often will only be ones that are a year or older--until that time only subscribers to the actual journal can read them. (Again, this varies from journal to journal.) A lot of academics think that information and research should be free and will send you a copy if you e-mail them politely during that time as well. 

I'm an editor for one of the online journals in my field and we discuss this stuff a lot. Our schools want us to publish in journals that are traditional--but doing so means we won't be cited often until our work is released to the databases so it seems counter-intuitive. If you want your work to be widely read you need to publish in places people can read it. *Sigh.* Another recommendation I got (and took) was to get my tenure contract written in such a way that explicitly would allow and ""count"" articles in free to the public online journals. 

tl;dr--Things are changing in academic publishing which makes your question hard to answer. :)

&gt;In fact, it's quite silly that the Democratic Party is pro-choice, considering how that stance is inconsistent with many of their other stances. The two parties should switch stances if they wish consistency. 

I do think this is true from an OBJECTIVE standpoint. But from a fallible human standpoint they are following the ideologies they think make sense to them. (Read: Which maximally justify their own failings while having protections in the areas they care less about being indulgent in.) A few decades ago the life/choice line was not so explicitly defined in the parties.

There's a new bridge that was built recently that is really nice right outside the city. Saigon is broken down into districts or ""quan"" in vietnamese where district 1 is the city center. One good route is if you go on google maps start in district 1 then go through district 4 to 7 over the bridge to 2 then to 9 then back to 1. If you have a lot of time you can ride to Vung Tau which is a beach city that is about 2 hrs away, that ride would be awesome if you're up for it. Mainly you can just follow the river if anything or if you get lost.

ProffieThrowaway,legaladvice,1390448576.0,"All of this is absolutely 100% true and students who get upset about their ""rights"" piss me off. 

But any professor that is enforcing rules more suited to high school (or lower) students probably does not see his or her college students as capable adults who can make their own decisions. If someone is rude and distracting others with their phone I ask them to leave, I don't need to take away everyone's devices and put them in a box. 

Behind the scenes professors with these kind of rules tend to see their students as idiots and say terrible, demoralizing things about them all the time. Of course, this is all based upon personal experience which isn't worth a lot, but the ones with the weirdest rules (seating charts, dress codes, not allowing beverages, etc.) also tend to be the ones that dumb down their course material past the point of it really being a ""college"" course at all. They stand around and say their students aren't capable of even high school level work while I teach at or above ""college-level"" work in the next classroom. 

This student is completely wrong about his or her ""rights,"" but they should probably pick a different section anyway.

Indirectly 

Comments making fun of how short a guy is(who's taller than I am) right in front of me are incessantly made. I can't imagine what goes on when I'm not in the room.

I constantly hear, ""but he's so short/he's short) in regards to talking about cute short guys. 

Tall almost universally being said as an invaluable addition, and often talked about in regards to a guy with a voice infused with sexual desire. I remember one time which was simultaneously good and bad. Group of women, at worst were ambivalent about black guys, and at best loved em(but not to the point of fetishizing them.) As a black man, that was great. Then, tall being one of the main features which were appealing about the specific black men they were attracted to, hurt. They knew me too, that was the worst thing. The feeling that you are the opposite of what was desired. I don't blame them, I want to emphasize that. 

Directly

Same as the second point I made, but to me directly.

Seeing women conflicted over whether to be attracted to me, based on my height specifically. No hate for them, it just hurts.

At this point, I figure I'm screwed. I no longer have the confidence, shorter guys need to compensate. I'm not unconfident, but I've noticed, on average, that us guys need to be a lot more confident and charming then taller men.

Discrimination in and of itself is not wrong, we discriminate all the time. Between blue and red, college majors, the type of car people drive. So what type of discrimination is wrong (discriminating based on race) and what type of discrimination is right (I choose blue over red all the time everytime). The distinction here comes from choice. It is perfectly acceptable to discriminate towards a person based on something that is their choice and within their power to change (smoking), but it is morally incorrect to discriminate against someone for something that is beyond their control (skin colour). 

So that is why it becomes a crucial part of the debate."

JamesGray,bestof,1390448762.0,"Not to mention the fact that the professor didn't up and steal the guy's phone without warning or something, he just clearly explained that phones are not allowed in his lectures. If the theater had posted rules that the device was not allowed within screenings and then simply refused the guy access while wearing his Glass, it wouldn't have been much of a story.

Honestly, though- I think saying something to the effect that asking you to print a syllabus is ""not allowed"" makes the OP sound absolutely infantile in his attitudes towards ""allowed"" versus something he simply doesn't like or isn't used to. It sort of puts a filter onto everything else he's asking, at least from my perspective."

A 30 Day CTA pass is $100. Seeing as individual fares are $2.25, the pass is worth your money if you make more than 6 round trips per week. Evanston has only one train line (that stops at like 12:30 or 1am) and much less bus coverage than Chicago proper so I really don't know if it's worth the money. 


Parking costs will vary widely depending on the apartment building and what not. I don't know how much street parking permits cost in Evanston but I think they're like ~~$25~~ $90 a year in Chicago.

Nobody can answer that question for you. Here are some questions for you to ponder, though. 

* How would your friend feel if he knew that he had a girlfriend who didn't find him attractive? 

* Let's say that you date, get married, the whole nine yards. How often will you be in the mood for sex with someone that you're not attracted to? How rejected will he feel when you hardly ever want to have sex with him because, duh, you're not attracted to him? 

For me, the answer was obvious. I didn't find her attractive because she isn't ambitious. I'm a Take Life By The Balls kind of guy, and she's a Life Just Sort Of Happens To Me kind of girl. I love her and she is a sweet and kind and wonderful person, but not a life partner, and her passivity is frankly unattractive to me. "

Think of all the software that you've ever installed. When installing they have check boxes pre-marked to automatically install third party software (toolbars, antivirus programs, etc.). If you simple click next and don't choose to opt out of installing those programs then they will install once the decision has been made. It made decisions for you already and you just say yes.

What OP wants is to use the same tactic for a good cause, organ donating. People are still free to opt out if they don't want to but the default will make it so that only those who really care will choose to do that."

motrin_and_water,progun,1390449082.0,"It's becoming increasingly difficult to be white in the military.

Example 1: My enlistment in the active reserve comes to an end and I'm transferred into the inactive reserve. I go through out-processing the month before my separation (drill weekend would've fallen after my sep date and I wouldn't have been paid), my paperwork is signed by a TSgt who just happened to be black. I receive my orders from HQ AFRC saying I'm being transferred to the inactive reserve. Great. I go back to my base the following February to collect my W2 from finance. The SAME TSgt who signed my separation papers asks why I haven't been participating at drill and why I have facial hair. So I show her my separation orders and the documents SHE signed saying I was transferred to the inactive reserve. She gets in my face that I fabricated the documents. I go to her section chief, also black, and he said that I fabricated the documents as well. I go to his officer in charge, also black, who backs up what his people have been saying. So finally I go to the WING COMMANDER, who reviews my orders and documentation and gives me a ""are you serious"" look regarding my treatment. 

Example 2: I'm a SSgt. We have a truck with some materials that need to be stored in our warehouse. I'm looking around for someone to help and find an Airman who is just studying for upgrade training (isn't crucial, can be picked back up, and can also be done on her personal time) I'm an NCO, I shouldn't be doing manual labor by myself, especially while junior enlisted are sitting in a nice air conditioned room. So I tell this Airman that she needs to help me unload this truck, her response ""I'm studying, MSgt. So and So told me to study"" I say great, this will take 5 minutes, and she can go back to studying. So with a harumph and exasperation she helps me unload a truck, took 5 minutes, she goes back to studying. Not 15 minutes later a black Senior NCO gets in my face regarding the harassment and unethical treatment I put this airman through. I defend myself saying that my orders were not dangerous or unlawful therefore not a problem. Well they try to make it a race issue. I respond by saying that skin color doesn't matter, but rank does. They respond that skin color trumps rank.

The amount of racism was sickening. The military code is that rank is rank, orders should be lawful and within reason. If you're junior enlisted and an Sgt tells you to move rocks, you move rocks. There's an understanding that there is a reason that the order is being given. I could give more examples but my blood pressure is already getting high and my chest is getting tight."

duckface08,nursing,1390449108.0,"There have been a lot of great tips in this thread already, but here's one I haven't seen yet: introduce yourself.

On a unit as big as mine, we see *a lot* of doctors of different specialties, residents, and med students. The doctors we see frequently I know pretty well and, for some of them, I even know their pager numbers. The residents and the med students always throw me off because I don't know them. I just see a random person reading and writing in my patient's chart. When I ask them what they're doing, I'd say the vast majority don't bother introducing themselves and not even telling me their status (resident or med student). I often find myself taking that first step (i.e. ""Hi, I'm duckface08, Mr. Smith's nurse. I don't recognize you. Who are you?""). It's just nice to have a name to put on a face, instead of ""That med student who was just here"". That way, if I see or talk to you again, I'd probably be more willing to help you out simply because I know who you are versus a nameless med student/resident.

Lastly, I know this is hard for a lot of doctors, but please try to write neatly :P"

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390449326.0,"Republican infighting at this point is so bad I really think the only thing uniting the party is a hatred of the democrats. I mean, I can pick out at least 4 distinct groups fighting for control of the party, and they really do fight bitterly amongst themselves. You got the establishment/neocons, you got the tea party, you got libertarians, you got the religious right, and possibly even more groups who will ultimately vote republican. 

I think there can be in fighting among democrats...we saw this in the obama vs hillary primary in 2008, and I think an increasing number of democrats are becoming dissatisfied with Obama's leadership and would like something more radical. Regardless, like the GOP, we're united in order to keep the other side as far away from the white house as possible.

SJW can be problematic, but I don't think they're really a visible or central point of the democratic party as of late. Not saying they don't exist, but I kinda feel they've lost relevance in modern times and come off as...well...fringe. They're often a caricature of the party rather than a representation of it. "

Given the data disclosed, which domestic agency could possibly be trusted?  Even the President, who promised an open government and protection for whistle-blowers has failed to keep up his end of the bargain.  

I wouldn't say he has committed treason.   Treason involves betraying ones country.  He betrayed the government, which has betrayed the trust of every U.S. citizen.   The government is supposed to operate the country on behalf of it's citizens, not come up with secret courts and mass surveillance systems with no consent of the people.  

With that said, what he did was against the terms of his privacy agreement and a plethora of laws I'm sure and should not be taken lightly.  However, it is an issue that is not largely important, given the bigger issue of what the U.S. Government is doing behind our backs.  You can't deny that Snowden's actions are very effective at keeping the NSA problems in the eye of the public, which is something the government would probably like to sweep under the rug. "

At least *tell me* so I can go in right away and redress it to keep it sterile and absorb any drainage that might be coming off of it. However, I will never, ever forget the doctor who came in, took off the dressing to look at the wound, and then *redressed it himself*. I had a look of shock on my face and he asked why. I said, ""I've never seen a doctor re-do a dressing after taking it off."" He replied, ""Isn't it a doctor's job to help the nurses?""

Fluffiebunnie,Libertarian,1390449628.0,"You're wrong about the taxis. First of all, there is regulation, it's just poorly enforced. What you call ""free market taxis"" are actually criminals. Normally competition would lead to companies (and reputable brands) being formed so people would know what they get into. But they can't form because of the regulation. The regulation only prevents the honest businessman from providing good services to the customers, it doesn't prevent disorganized and hard to catch black market taxis from operating.

It's almost like saying that the fact that drug dealers are shady, dangerous and in general just ""do what they want"" proves that a free market in narcotics would be a disaster. While it's possible that it would turn into a disaster, it's the lack of possibility for legitimate businesses to develop that causes the current disaster in the narcotics market."

I've even had food wrappers thrown at me from cars, the passengers yelling at me to ""gain some weight"". Thankfully as an adult I've gained several pounds (hooray for puberty) but I still get comments now and again from coworkers who, not unlike your friend, are insecure about their own bodies but instead of doing anything about it choose to tear others down instead. As a result of all this the word ""skinny"" will always have a very negative connotation in my mind. That said, your friend is being incredibly rude and hypocritical by bashing others to make herself feel better. I agree with the other posters - shut her down every time she tries to bring it up.

SirNuke,AnnArbor,1390449838.0,"I've never done it 'regularly', but I have taken the Wolverine line quite a bit.  Delays are all over the map (consistent with the rest of Amtrak).  Departure is usually on a ""eh, whatever"" length of a ~half hour, but when things get bad, they get bad.  I had one Chicago-&gt;AA trip that got stopped for over two hours, after delaying pretty significantly at Chicago.  I think I got off the train well after 2am.

As for the trains themselves:  Amtraks are hands down the most comfortable way to get from point A to point B.  Big seats with lots of leg room, outlets everywhere.  Large windows to look out of.  There's some train noise, but it's not that bad.  Bring someone to talk to or headphones.  No TSA so you just show up and get on the train.  Even tickets are checked on the train after departure.   No seatbelts and you can walk around whenever you want.  The Wolverine line doesn't have Wifi, but I get pretty good signal Spring signal the entire way.  There's an onboard shop selling cold/microwaveable food at varying quality and value.  I'm not really a coffee drinker, but I'm told their coffee is both fairly cheap and good tasting.  I do highly recommend bringing a cold meal with you to eat if the trip covers a meal time.  Oh, and they sell the usual import/domestic beer suspects at not as bad markups as you'd imagine.

Amtrak stations themselves always seem to be in the sketchiest, middle-of-no-where places, kinda like Greyhound stations - though this doesn't really apply to Union State and Ann Arbor.  Ann Arbor is pretty barren minus an indoor room for waiting in the cold, and I've never had trouble getting a long term parking space.  Union Station is a more complete airport-like experience, with a respectable food court and a taxi stand.

Compared to a plane, it's slower, considerably less stressful, and far cheaper.  Compared to a bus, it's more expensive and similar travel times, but more comfortable.  Compared to both, it'll be far less consistent on time."

The farming itself also seemed ultra-tedious.

That said, I also had a problem with Island of Happiness. The game was way too complicated in my opinion. The threat of losing villagers or integral parts of the island if you didn't ship certain items made it nearly impossible to specialize in one type of product. I also just felt like the game was difficult to control (Island of Happiness was the first handheld title to use the touch screen for movement and the buttons only for item presets and I thought it was horrible).

Anywhere in Switzerland it will take a while to integrate (especially if you're moving for good, Swiss are sometimes more friendly to tourists and visitors than to their neighbours), so don't feel discouraged if you haven't made any friends in a few years. Get settled, do your thing (work in particular), say Grüezi when you meet people walking by, and you'll do just as well as a Basler moving there.

There's no reason to be scared at all, you might deal with some racist comments, but they'll be of the ""C'mon guys, seriously? We're in the 21st century!"" type rather than, ""Oh shit, imma get lynched!"" type. 

If you're hippyish you might be a bit reluctant to call them on it if they say something that's inaccurate about you (make sure it is actually inaccurate rather than just politically incorrect), feel free to call them on it. Being direct and calling out bullshit is a Swiss thing to do, and they won't be any less friendly or welcoming if you do, 'cause they're already pretty low on the friendly &amp; welcoming scale to begin with."

banana-tree,Turkey,1390450260.0,"I was referring to your claim that CHP during the single-party rule was minority-friendly and wasn't authoritarian, among other things, just off the top of my head, but I'm really not going into that debate again. 

This isn't a race to the bottom, I couldn't care less how Armenian nationalist reactions compare to that of Turks. I don't know what that comparison is supposed to achieve either. 'Nations' aren't monolithic, and the actions of one or few or even many among them don't reflect on the other individuals. Not positively, and not negatively. 

That's also why claiming that local Turks or the Ottoman state took part in looting and massacres (or calling it genocide) isn't ""anti-Turkish"". Even if it's a false claim it's not anti-Turkish. Some anti-Turkish people may be using that to further a certain agenda, but the claim itself isn't anti-Turkish. It's not automatically a characterization and an expression of hate towards an entire people unless it's 'all Turks are genocidal' or something. To paint everyone who utters the word genocide as anti-Turkish points to a dangerous sort of nationalistic generalization. It's like that stupid 'insulting Turkishness' clause in Article 301.

Dink isn't an exception (I'm not referring to his murder when I bring him up - that part is more complicated than mere nationalism anyway). I see serious threats and discriminatory speech daily and from high-level officials as well, directed at Turkish Armenians (among other minorities), stemming and generalized from the political agendas of other Armenians. Nazi analogies and all. I find that dangerous. It shouldn't be taken for granted and considered normal and expected.

I think the way these debates usually go both demonstrates and fuels those reflexes. It takes away from and prevents the acknowledgement of the suffering (not just deaths but separations, assimilation and financial aspects as well) of hundreds of thousands of people, regardless of how politically justified it was at the time. The state can deal with the diplomacy and political agendas. Seeing individuals justifying and normalizing relocations, looting and massacres based on ethnicity disturbs and worries me."

Even with that in mind, I've seen it happen with drunks too, but in their case they are way more dangerous behind the wheel and doing anything while drunk in general.

There was a big exercise pen in the yard for the puppies to play. The puppies were clean and happy, our boy was the first puppy to run up to my husband to say hi, as if he was meant for us :) 

Both the sire and dam had their OFA papers to certify good hips, we just had our boy's hips checked a couple of months ago and he got a good rating just like his parents. Puppies had all of their AKC papers, vet exam papers, vaccination papers etc. He also came with a care package - just a little box with a measuring cup for food, booklets about caring for a puppy etc. and a blanket with his mom's scent. All good breeders will have a contract for you to sign which outlines both their and your responsibilities, make sure to read it!

And the idea that words perpetuate social dominance or subordination can be clearly seen in an endless number of psychological experiments.  Stanford Prison Experiment, The Milgram Experiment, even simpler ones where people are primed to believe one person is an authority figure, which have been done ad nauseum in endless variation.  The terms weren't reflecting something that is already there, like you claim, they just arbitrarily gave some people authority and people submitted to those whims.  Just like folks arbitrarily use hurtful words and people unconsciously submit to those negative norms rather than reality.

Yeah, on the massive scale, threats and actual force are the end result, but they come about from a perpetual stream of cultural programming which is undoubtedly linked to language.  I mean, people like Napoleon Bonaparte realized that religion is excellent stuff for keeping poor people quiet... because it's just words that make people okay with being subordinate and dominated."

When I first found this sub, I remember loving it from the way the jokes and humor were set up, in a very offbeat way. But that humor takes awhile to develop, so instead of wasting time learning humor, they did the simple and easy thing: make memes. Doing this inspired more of the new people that this was the way the subreddit worked, and before we knew it, the front page was just filled with first world problem memes. And it didn't stop there.

NeonGreenTV,AskReddit,1390451007.0,"A lot of these trendy TV shows. Shit like Sherlock etc. I watched Breaking Bad since like the 2nd season, I was hooked I loved it til the end. Mind, I don't watch much TV. I got (good) internet back in 2005, before then I didn't even bother because I was on dial-up and it was super slow. But when I got good internet and basically and endless source of info and ways to stay entertain instead of the old, 15 sec of show commercial, 1 minute of show commercial, 15 minutes of show 18 5 minutes of commercial - never wanted to go back.

After Breaking Bad, I asked friends for more show suggestions. And I can't get into anything. Because I see how these people are hyped about these shows, and these annoying fandoms pop up and I want to try. None ever live up to the hype. I'm not saying they're bad, but I just don't get the appeal of a lot of these shows.

Dizech,AskMen,1390451007.0,"If you want to bang your BF at Day 1, go for it. If you want to wait til Day 349, that's cool too. In your social circle it sounds like waiting is more common. And that's totally cool, so long as both partners are on the same page. The issues comes when one or both parties wants to be sexual, but they aren't because ""My friends will think I'm a slut"", ""I don't want to seem easy"", etc. 

Again, there is nothing wrong with waiting til marriage or whatever, but IMO it's 100% pointless to assign some arbitrary date as being the designated day to do it. Having a ""rule"" just leads to exceptions and ""Oh he's different"".  Personally I find the best results are to just go for it when it feels natural. I know a couple people who were only together for a week or two before doing the nasty, and they're all happily committed. YMMV

TL;DR: Don't feel like you have to do it to keep your man if you don't want to, but don't feel like you shouldn't because your friends will shame you either.

On the purity topic: yes it's a catch-22. There are hundreds of catch-22s in dating for both parties involved, but such is life. It seems like every girl wants a guy with a muscular body but ""Only if he's just a little muscular not like a gym rat or anything ewwww"", as if men pop out of the womb with six packs and engorged biceps naturally.

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390451097.0,"&gt; If Walmart isn't paying the employees what they are worth why are the employees willing to work for the wage?

Because they don't have access to a better job opportunity.

&gt; I'm seriously asking, how wre you defining what they are worth?

Well, there's a number of ways you can measure that. Here's how I would: take all the money that a company takes in, subtract all costs except labor, then divide what's left by the number of people working for the company. 

&gt;How do you judge purchasing power in areas with different cost of living? If min wage was standard across the US would it not mean that people in areas with high cost of living still have less purchasing power than others in different areas if they all earn the same?

That's how it is in the status quo. There would be a higher federal minimum wage, but once again states would have the option to set their own minimums above that.  But you're right, it would mean that minimum wage earners in NYC would have less purchasing power than those in Kansas, but that's not really much of a problem for any reason I can see.

&gt;In your third point you say Walmart is paying lower than min wage. How is that possible without Walmart being sued? I think you really mean that those employees might not receive enough hours, not that their wage is lower than the min. Isn't that a different problem? Bill gates said today that 88% of min wage workers are above the proverty line. That doesn't fit with the picture you paint. 

He didn't say they pay below minimum wage, he said they pay below-poverty-line wages. His point is that because Wal-Mart pays their employees so little, their employees get food stamps, Medicaid, welfare, etc. to make ends meet, which means that the rest of us are partly paying for this worker to live. This guy works for a living, for a company that makes enormous profits, and we're stuck paying for part of his income because he gets paid like shit. "

On company property? Probably legal.  Unless this is a government agency.

&gt;*They reserve the right to comb through our personal social media profiles, blogs, tweets, emails, voicemails, etc, even our text messages to make sure we're not 'defaming the company'.

If by ""comb through"" you mean ""read what is publicly available on the internet due to your lack of privacy settings"", and then discipline you based upon that?  Legal.

&gt;They reserve the right to *crack our passwords to gain access to our electronic data. This just CANNOT be legal.

You're right.  Illegal.  However, if they ask you for the password, and you refuse, they might be able to fire you.  I'm not sure your state's specific law on that issue.

&gt;*They instituted a dress code with company shirts, which is fine except that we're no longer allowed to wear our jackets inside. The office is cold, most of us were shivering today, and they won't provide us with company jackets either. We have to just be cold.

Company shirts, obviously legal.  Not wearing jackets, legal.  Office being ""too cold"", probably legal.  OSHA does not require any particular temperature for a working environment until the temperature is cold enough to cause serious physical injury (and cold weather gear is not provided/allowed).  I doubt Texas offers any additional protection, though I confess I'm not sure.

&gt;They are now requiring us to carry our personal items in clear plastic bags, which we would have to pay for ourselves. I object to this because I have medication &amp; inhalers I have to carry with me along with feminine hygiene products, and that kind of stuff is nobody's business but mine. This seems like it'd violate some sort of medical privacy law.

Likely legal.

&gt;They also made a rather ambiguous ""no skinny jeans"" rule. Most of the girls here &amp; a few of the guys exclusively wear slim-fit or ""skinny"" jeans, and hey'll have to go out and spend their own money on new clothes to comply with this rule.

&gt;Don't wait to get married to figure out that neither of you are willing to clean the bathroom.

We know perfectly well that neither of us will clean the bathroom. That's why we have a cleaning service. It's the same way with your other examples: these are trivial details, and they can all be worked out with mutual understanding and respect. 

It's the big things that matter. If she wants a career but you want her to be a housemommy, all of a sudden, she won't be able to tolerate your socks on the floor either. But it isn't about the socks, is it. I mean, it's just socks. It's because she thinks you ruined her life, and now she's not going to take your fucking socks on the floor.

&gt;The point of Marriage is that you are DONE LOOKING. You have found THE ONE. Period.

That's a lot of punctuation, my friend. I don't believe in ""the one"". Really, you're looking for a teammate for life. It can't be just anybody, but it could be a lot of people. Do you share the same values and want the same things? Can you solve problems together and trust each other?

&gt;Close your eyes. Now, picture the face you want to see on the pillow next to you when you wake up. Is it his/hers? If its not, stop kidding yourself my friend. Get out.

Dude, I've gotta tell you. 15 years, 2 kids, and 3 years fighting cancer, and Mrs. Anderson doesn't look a damn thing like the woman that I married. But I love her and her chemo-jacked-up teeth and her radiation-jacked-up hair. I love to watch her playing with the kids, teaching them about life. I love spending time together. 

&gt;Is there something about this person that bothers you? Because if you think that you are going to fix/change the other person ""later"" or ""after we're married"" stop that train of thought right the fuck now. It won't happen. You'll just both get pissed at each other.

This is a little silly. Sure, there are things that I do that bother her, and she does to bother me. But at a certain point, I'm willing to accept that she's doing her best not to bother me in exchange for her giving me the same latitude. 

The rest, I pretty much agree with, but I guess what really struck me was getting stuck in the details without regard to the big picture. It's the big stuff that matters. With it, you generate enough good will between spouses that you can negotiate through the little stuff. "

Think about other successful relationships you know about.  Even arranged ones.  The most successful will be ones where the parties communicate, respect one another and act as a team. 

For an arranged marriage this might be more difficult because you two don't know each other that well but are at a very high level of commitment.  So someone has to open up first and show the other that it's going to be safe to do so. So someone has to be the one to take a risk. 

So my advice to you would be to discuss this with him just as you have framed it to us.  Discuss how culturally there is this pressure, how you feel insecure because of how *sexy you find him.  

*Get as risky with the statement as you feel comfortable with.  If ""attractive"" is all you are able to do then fine, but try to push yourself.   "

RichardBehiel,spacex,1390451457.0,"&gt; Better is to get that stage moving up Kilimanjaro on a rocket/maglev sled, ignite and eject near the peak. Then it's moving between .3-3 km/sec before imparting it's own impulse. 

This would be very dangerous.  How would you hold the rocket if there were a problem during ignition?  The F9 is held on the launchpad until T+3 seconds to make sure that ignition went well and that the thrust is ramping up as expected (slow thrust ramp was the cause of one of the SES-8 holds).  If you put the F9 at the top of a mountain, traveling at supersonic speed, holding it in the event of some sort of anomaly wouldn't exactly be trivial.

&gt; It'd play nicely with the Hyperloop concept though I think the preferred solution would be acceleration in local atmosphere instead of evacuated tube. 

I agree.  Hyperlooping it would make the whole launch process much more complex, while only helping marginally at best, especially considering that rockets are already built to withstand huge compressive aerodynamic loads

Speaking of, what's the general consensus on Hyperloop around here?"

Seriously, if this were any other condition... broken bone? Don't set it, just wear a sling and learn to fight through the pain with some deep breathing techniques. Leukemia? Radiation is too expensive, just learn to *cope* with the pain and likely death. Genitals got fucked up in an accident? Oh no, you don't need to get them fixed, you just need to therapy to learn how to deal with it.

No one seems to understand this. Or rather, they understand, but they don't understand that just because I can't have surgery, doesn't mean I'm going to stop needing it. They can't see that it's like any other condition - they just haven't experienced it. They can't see that I'm not causing this dysphoria myself. So when someone tells me that I should get therapy to learn how to cope, I just get so pissed off because that's it. There's so much prejudice against us I have to learn how to cope instead of just solving the problem. I'm not going to put up with it forever. I don't want to *cope*, and struggle for every bit of... not even happiness, just less pain. Dysphoria is going to kill me if I don't get surgery someday."

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390451682.0,"Well, first of all, the band measurement is based on a stretched band, because you need the stretch for tension and support.

Secondly, there's only so much you can do with measurements.  We can do the math and give you a starter size, and you try bras around that size and see how they fit.  Even once you've found your general ideal size, bras are like any other clothing, sometimes you'll need to size up or down due to construction, cut, materials, or brand.

On top of that, there's shape, which is just as important as size.  A 32F with a shallow shape won't fit projected 32F breasts, or vice versa.  Wire width, cup height, and strap placement also play a big role in the fit.  There's a great guide about shape in the sidebar that you should really read, if you haven't already.

Lastly, learning the signs of a well fitting bra is crucial to this whole process.  A feeling of tightness and bulgy back bits is actually usually a sign of a too big band and too small cup.  You might find that tweaking your size can help, as can trying a differently shaped bra.  Posting your measurements, current bra styles and fit issues, and general idea about your shape will help us help you troubleshoot, if you want.

However, what we're aiming for is your comfort!  If you're happy with your 36Ds, and don't want to change, more power to you!  Lots of us have found that more precise fitting has really made a difference to our comfort and appearance, but we can't and don't want to tell you what to want or feel.

It's interesting how well it worked though - she went from no messages to a TON of messages, to finding out how to narrow things down to only meet with the people that were a good enough match.

Hole in the walls are the best.  I keep mentioning fish tacos, and the place I used to go to had the BEST fish tacos, and seriously, there were none better around.  Everyone had all these spots that they would flock to...I went to them, they were good, but nothing like this place.  And man, I hype them up like crazy, too, and it doesn't even matter - usually you don't want to get people's expectations too high because then they'll be disappointed, but it just doesn't happen at that place.  They're too good, and at a dollar a piece?  Same for shrimp?  Can't beat that!

Butttt if you like carnitas (my favorite), I recently changed my method because of one of my favorite food authors/bloggers who *really* knows his stuff.

Also, can you do volunteer work? I've gotten a lot of pride from not only being needed by others, but from the feeling of fulfilling higher duties.

LucasSatie,gamingsuggestions,1390452019.0,"Star Ocean really *can* be an amazing game. The story lines always tend to have some odd holes and weird bits but the overall gameplay is usually very good. And, they're all unrelated. Each game presents a different plot, though there's always a trend. 

**The Second Story** was by far my favorite. I usually hear that people highly enjoy **Til the End of Time**, I liked it but ended up putting it down due to an issue I had with it and never finishing it (though I always intend to go back). **The Last Hope** was good, but suffered in all the same ways all the others did. Do not, I repeat, **do not** pick up **The Last Hope** if you are a completionist. The trophies are damn near impossible to get and you *will* end up hating your console if you attempt to craft all the best gear.

If I had to rate them, I'd give **The Second Story** an 8.5/10, **Til the End of Time** a 7/10 and **The Last Hope** a 6.5/10. Then again, I'm a big fan of the series and so I play them even if they aren't that great (sort of like Final Fantasy).

If you can get past the dated graphics, I would highly recommend **The Second Story**. There's a few pieces to be warned about, but only if you decide to pick it up. Very honestly, I pick this one up again every six months or so. I think I've beaten it a dozen times, completionist style each time."

anonagent,worldnews,1390452058.0,"If Netflix wants to distribute video, they have to protect it with DRM, currently that drm is a part of Adobe Flash, hence having to have flash to watch videos on netflix, the codec inside the flash file isn't something special, it's just your normal everyday video codec that anyone can decode, the reason for flash is only for the DRM componet.

in recent years, people have gotten up in arms over how much flash sucks and Netflix wants to please their customers by offering streaming through HTML5, the problem with that is that the media production companies (Paramount, Universal, Fox, etc) contractually REQUIRE drm to make it more diffucult to access their media.

Netflix can't change that, the companies don't need netflix as much as netflix needs them, therefore they have more leverage and are requiring drm.

are you getting this? Netflix needs DRM to stay alive, and their only choices are to keep flash, or move to HTML and include a drm componet with it..."

TMA-3,AskReddit,1390452117.0,"I used to be a beat cop a long time ago.

And I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time, hundreds probably over the years.

But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit, that I will never forget. Gordy, he looked like Bo Svenson, you remember him? Walking Tall? Anyway, big boy. 270, 280. But his wife, whatever she was, his lady...was real small. Like a bird. Wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I got called out there every weekend, and one of us would pull her aside and say ""come on, tonight’s the night we press charges."" And this wasn't one of those ""deep-down he-loves-me"" set-ups--we get a lot of those--but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn’t going to cross him, no way, no how. Nothing we could do but pass her off to the EMT’s, put him in a car and drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next morning out he goes. Back home.

But one night, my partner’s out sick, and it’s just me. And the call comes in and it’s the usual crap. Broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we’re driving into town, and this sideways asshole is in my back seat humming ""Danny Boy."" And it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right, out into nowhere. And I kneel him down, and I put my revolver in his mouth, and I told him, ""This is it. This is how it ends."" And he’s crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he’s going to leave her alone. Screaming...as much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him to be quiet. Cause I needed to think about what I was going to do here. And of course he got quiet. Goes still. And real quiet. Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. And we just stood there for a while, me acting like I’m thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. And after a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth, and I say, ""So help me if you touch her again I will such-and-such and such-and-such and blah blah blah blah blah"".

Just trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later he killed her. Of course. Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender. We got there, there was so much blood you could taste the metal. The moral of the story is: I chose a half measure, when I should have gone all the way. I’ll never make that mistake again.

No more half measures, OP."
JonWood007,Shitstatistssay,1390452122.0,"&gt;Technology is a product of human intellectual curiosity. I don't see any logical reason why a state is required to produce technology.

Pooling resources leads to more tech.

&gt;How do you feel about the idea of states going to war with other states?

As it is, we live in the state that has the most men with the bigger guns. We outspend every country in the world on military spending, and beyond that, we have nukes, which basically makes a conflict between us and a REAL threat slim to none because the war would be so destructive it acts as a deterrent. Most of our conflicts are in the form of asymmetical warfare, rather than an actual conflict. Get rid of our state and we'd be a lot less secure and more open to attack from other states and even larger tribes. That's a big thing...say we dissolve the US. What's to stop China or something from moving right in? It's foolish to think we can just demolish the entire nation state system, even if the US did it, there's still 190 left. Also, the only country that seems to act in the way you describe is somalia (stateless society with numerous tribal authorities), and that's not really a very promising model.

I mean, dont get me wrong, I like how your model finds a way to eliminate both the state and corporations rather than just giving up one for another, but I still don't see it as feasible, and would likely make the average 1st world citizen much less secure and a lot worse off."

ArcFurnace,pokemontrades,1390452236.0,"3IV Dittos aren't too bad from Friend Safari, with the guaranteed 2 perfect IVs the chance of at least one more being perfect as well is 12% or so.  4IV Dittos are harder, but there is a way that gives you a halfway decent chance- if you're using the Poke Radar, the longer the chain, the more IVs are guaranteed to be perfect.  At a chain of [61 and up](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1shpw4/guide_how_to_reliably_catch_3iv_dittos_in_gen_vi/), you're guaranteed 3 perfect IVs (this is also obviously another way of getting 3IV Dittos).  The chance of at least one more IV being perfect for a 4IV Ditto is about 9% (at least, if I'm doing the math right).  

5IV and 6IV Dittos are rather more difficult.  It's possible, but it's probably not going to happen- and you're almost certainly not going to find them on the GTS.  Even with the Poke Radar chaining guaranteeing 3 perfect IVs, the chance of getting a perfect 6IV Ditto is 1 in 32,786 (1 in 1,048,576 for Friend Safari).  

RNG manipulation, or just straight-up hacking, is vastly easier."

gametemplar,twilightimperium,1390452303.0,"I'm probably going to sound like a bit of an asshole, so let's just get that out of the way now.

You're playing the game wrong. It's really as simple as that. That's a hard thing to say with a game like Twilight Imperium, since there are so many ways to customize the game and so many fan made variants out there. Nevertheless, one thing stands out like a sore thumb:

&gt; And still no one picked Imperial I because it wasn't in their best interests.

At no point in the game was it worth someone's time to score 2 Victory Points? Barring any house rules or variants, the goal of the game is to score 10 Victory Points. It's the one thing I emphasize over and over, when I'm teaching the game or when I'm babbling incoherently in this sub - Everything you do should be working towards earning Victory Points.

Now don't get me wrong - it's a *lot* of fun to collect all the Technology Advances, build massive fleets to send into battle, and wage war on your opponents. I get it. I love doing that, too... and it's one of the biggest reasons why people lose. It's very, very easy to become distracted by all the shiny techs and cool ships that you forget to work towards winning. While building up an unstoppable juggernaut can be fun, it's not as much fun when everyone else is doing the same thing. Part of the tension of the game is having to make a play for an Objective when it might not be the ideal moment for it.

It's because of this that I emphasize the Victory Points so much. The problem of your game taking so long is a common one in my experience, and it's just as common that in situations like the one you describe, players are not actively pursuing Victory Points. If you are not playing for Victory Points, the game will drag on until you're sick of it. Players need to be working completing Public Objectives and Secret Objectives to drive the game to its conclusion.

At any rate, if your games are taking too long you need to be focusing on Victory Points. It's really that simple. 

Having said all of that, I'm curious as to which variant you were using that changed the text to what you had listed above. It's not quite the Ancient Throne Variant found [here](http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=21&amp;esem=4) (under the Variant Rules link), which I would recommend using. Note that use of the Ancient Throne/Imperial II variant requires the Age of Empire option listed in the core rules."

I'm a little taller than she is and I find that being below 100 makes me look sick. It's probably all in my head because I've never had like bones sticking out, but to me I needed to put on some more weight. I guess it is just the differences in our frames? It is really funny to me because after gaining weight, nowadays it's impossible to find nice clothes because of the 11 inch difference between my hips and waist; something that I didn't have before I broke the 100 pound threshold. Despite being health conscious, I can see why your ex didn't want to gain weight; the selection of clothing really does change when you get bigger than a size 2. Hell, I'm barely able to wear a size four despite having a 23 inch waist!"

i think that ultimately it did work out for the better because it made me get help for my depression. and like you said, he/the LDR were holding me back because i was not doing anything except sit at the computer (which is bad enough because i have online classes)

winewagens,Volkswagen,1390452408.0,"In essence you want to borrow one of someone's most prized possessions to drive halfway across the country on a road trip, admirable, but it's an idea with a few big potential problems.


These include, but are not limited to: the owner's insurance even covering the bus being ""rented"" by someone (most do not), insurance liability if something happened on the road or when parked (yours or theirs), and who pays for the costs of repairs if a breakdown occurred while on the road.  IF you could find a person willing to make such an unsupervised agreement whose insurance company also approved, you'll be **very** lucky.  


Buses also can be somewhat slower than modern cars and normally get in the low 20mpg range, push it too hard and it can overheat.   Even well maintained old buses can have a hiccup now and then due to an aging part or inferior quality aftermarket replacement part.  Do you have the knowledge, mechanical aptitude, tools, and patience to fix the 40+ year old bus you ""rented"" from someone if an unforeseen problem were to arise on the road?

I have 2 bugs and 2 buses that I drive when life permits, with 3 more buses in varied states of restoration. None of these I'd rent out to anyone, even with a deposit, due to how the insurance policies are phrased and the financial investment each of them represents.  I'm also probably only a few years older than you, 26 here, so none of this is of the ""You're a young whipper snapper, don't rent somebody's car"" type advice.  It's trying to explain the overlooked intricate details that, if things go wrong, could totally mess shit up.

You may be better off buying a decent bus, taking your trip, then selling it afterwards.  Though once you have one and invest time into making it reliable, you may not want to sell it afterwards. 



I'm not saying businesses don't exist that provide such rental services (they do), but they won't be cheap.  Though they would be cheaper than any legal issues that could arise from ""renting"" a bus from someone, having an accident, and the insurance company telling all of you to fly a kite because you were outside the boundaries of said person's policy.  Additionally, some classic only providers won't cover certain campers due to the propane tank for the stove, driving to shows far from home and staying overnight somewhere in it, or a myriad of other reasons.


Two such companies are below that can be found using the search terms ""VW bus rental"" on Google:

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390452517.0,"&gt;Why is what the employee deserves based on the profit of the company?

Because the employees are the constituents of the company. They make up the company. The success of the organization should be shared by the participants in the organization.

&gt;If I sweep floors at Walmart should I get more money than the guy who sweeps floors at the general store? What about franchises? Employee wages must come from the profits of the store, the larger company earns profits from franchise fees only. 

Given that much information both deserve an equal wage. But I'd rather have it be unequal and more than it is now for both than equal and 7-something bucks an hour like it is now.

&gt;If you give people in Kansas the same money as someone in NYC for the same job then can't the guy in Kansas have much nicer things than the guy in NYC because the guy in NYC has to pay way more for his housing? Is that fair? 

Given how much unfairness there is in the world I'm not concerned with that. You're not living in luxury in either place. If you're making minimum wage in NYC you're fucked and in Kansas you're scraping by. I don't really give a shit if $10 bucks in Kansas goes farther than in NYC.

&gt;He did claim they pay less than min wage. But again, if 88% of people on min wage are above the poverty line how does that match the picture you paint?

I'd like a better source than Bill Gates, first of all. Second, 12% means three out of every 25 workers, which is a lot considering you're only talking about the employed. Third, and most importantly, the poverty line is a very small amount of money to get by on. You should try it. "

Absolutely false. Total US government tertiary education spending has been going up for decades and was the highest it's ever been in our history just a couple of years ago: http://bit.ly/1cXsAFa

I understand that statists tend to live in a fairy tale land where they think that throwing more money at a government program is somehow going to create more efficiency, but your ""facts"" that cutting government spending on college has caused the tuition crisis is a complete fabrication.

&gt;State and local higher education appropriations have been going down for two decades and tuition prices have seen a commensurate increase.

Please know that you are choosing to hike AT YOUR OWN RISK. That’s not to say that you will be mauled by a pack of hyenas out there but things happen and they might be beyond my control. In a nutshell, I’m going for a walk you people are just following me for some strange reason.

* Dress appropriately. That means layer up if its brisk outside, put on sun screen, wear comfortable shoes, don’t come naked (it puts people off).
* Bring enough food and water. Yes we’re in the city and there are places to stop and restock but it helps to always bring some water (I bring a gallon always) and some granola bars or something to snack on. 
* If you’re under 18, make sure your parents are with you. I’m not carding anyone but just make sure you’re a legal consenting adult, because a bunch of sweaty adults hanging out with a kid might give people the wrong idea.
* Be prepared to get lots of exercise. Stretch, hydrate, etc.
* Bring a positive attitude. I’m not expecting you to smile nonstop this just means don’t pick fights with random strangers and respect others."

tzivje,AskWomen,1390452791.0,"I lived in Germany for two years between high school and college. 

During that time, I met a German guy. We fell in love fast, and were serious about a future together. But my German wasn't good enough to get into a German university, so I went back to the states to go to college, intending to do a study abroad program in the same city.

A few other things happened along the way. Two years later I returned to him after dropping all my classes first semester of junior year. I stayed in his city for three months and went home for Christmas. While I was home, I realized I could not possibly justify leaving my family and my education to be with him. (Some of his attitudes towards me made me feel like I wasn't good enough to live in Germany, so there were other factors that went into that decision. I just couldn't leave my *life* for someone who didn't seem to completely respect me)

So that was that.

Uploads to the cloud and they try and match all the songs in your library up to 20k songs so that they don't have to store them individually (the ones they match they just give you permission to listen to their own stored copies.)  If they can't match them they'll store them for you anyway.

You wanna get more music the completely untraceable way.  Get a bootlegged copy of wondershare.  It records songs as they play.  Make a playlist of whatever songs you want on spotify.  Start up wondershare to record (you might need to tweak the settings a bit in both programs to offer a big enough silence in between songs to allow for song change recognition.)  Play your spotify playlist overnight as you get some Zs. (Apples supposedly can record the song with the sound on mute, my PC couldnt so i just put in some headphones to keep my computer quiet.)  Wondershare matches the song to a database and changes all the info on the file to be appropriate to the song including album artwork. Whatever the song is at when you wake up and need your computer, delete all the songs before that one the playlist, pause the programs and come back when free.  Keep doing till you have your entire recorded library.  Upload that folder via google play music as mentioned before, voila.  You got your songs and no one knows you stole them.

Its not the *best* interface but play music will stream your stuff to your phone without ads or any sort of payment scheme."

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1390453241.0,"Pros:

1. I've got my shit together. My employment, financial and housing situations are optimal. My friends are kind and loving and awesome. My family relationships are peaceful and drama-free.  I get along with the people I need to get along with.  I'm competent at all the skills I need for day-to-day life.  I don't think I've been in a situation that I didn't know how to handle in years. (I can't resolve every situation myself, of course, but I know where to turn when I can't do it myself.)
2. I am congenitally monogamous (my brain is incapable of being sexually or romantically interested in more than one person at once) and fiercely loyal. I don't speak ill of my partner to others at all, ever. Even after they leave me.
3. Because I'm so introverted, I'm not especially demanding on my partner's time. I'm perfectly content with a quiet evening in. I'm even content staying home alone if my partner has to do something that doesn't involve me.  But, because I work from home, I'm also quite happy to go out because I get my necessary dose of alone time during my workday.
4. Because I've been taking care of everything for myself since I was a teenager, I have no problem with taking care of everything myself. If my partner is having cash flow issues or doesn't know how to fix their computer or is intimidated by comparison-shopping for a new TV, it's fine, I got this. But, at the same time, I'm not particularly attached to taking care of anything myself (apart from things that affect my own person), so I'll gladly cede the floor in whatever matters are most important to my partner.
5. I'm of above-average attractiveness, and clean up to show-offable when I put on full kit.  My attractiveness is on an upwards trajectory as I become more skilled at various beauty processes, and I'm aging (superficially) at a slower rate than my peers.  
6. Apparently I'm likeable and have a good sense of humour. Not something I can evaluate for myself objectively, obviously, but friends and colleagues and family members and acquaintances seem to seek out spending time with me and specifically tell me they enjoy my humour. They also tend to ask my advice rather a lot, which might suggest that I have good judgement/insight.

Cons:

1. I'm not particularly skilled at sex. I still have significant room for improvement (haven't put in as many hours as you'd expect from someone my age), but if you're looking for a sex goddess I'm not it.
2. Between my intense introversion and the environment in which I grew up, I have the dual challenge of normal social conventions not coming to me naturally and having a skewed understanding of just what normal social conventions are.  I've been making a concerted effort to remedy this and I believe I'm up on the theory, but I still have to make a deliberate effort and not everything is second nature yet. So every once in a while I might blabber on about how my day was and forget to ask you about yours, or lead with one-upping instead of empathy.
3. I'm terrified of anything with more than 4 legs. If you get involved with me, you're in charge of bug killing."

You haven't spent a great deal of time browsing /r/keto, /r/loseit, /r/xxfitness, etc. have you? One day, you'll have spent enough time in other popular subs such as those where certain methods of weight loss are oft deemed 'magic' and thus the foods and style of eating result in weight loss, no matter how many calories are taken in. 

After 1000's of statements such as ""I eat 10k calories from bacon a day and still lose 2 kg a week!"" or ""fat loss is impossible because the human body doesn't count calories"" you begin to trivialize and see it in a comical light.

dakru,AskMen,1390453420.0,"The general idea is that women don't find pushovers very attractive, so they sometimes push boundaries in their interactions with a man they're considering as a partner to see whether he's a pushover.

One form of this might be an unreasonable request, like a woman at a bar asking a guy to buy her a drink. Complying with her request might seem like the ""right"" way to respond but it's more likely to get her to just take the drink and walk away. A guy's probably going to get a better reaction by saying no and then being able to flirt and tease her.

There are other ways to shit test too. Here are a few good links on them:

http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1e1kfm/billys_guide_to_shit_tests/

I don't think there's really any direct equivalent for something men to do women because we're not as concerned with a partner's strength of character and how much they're not a pushover. And I say this in a matter-of-fact way to answer your question; I'm not complaining about the fact that women don't generally like pushovers. It'd be like women complaining about how men don't generally like fat women."

1) We were outnumbered pretty significantly, and thus I was part of a Guerilla unit assigned to defending the Rhineland from France.

Also, there was this whole fiasco where I *allegedly* tortured some French POWs and stuff. It wasn't *that* big of a deal like everybody made it out to be. 

3) I managed it in a variety of ways. Originally I would do something like stab myself in the arm and go to the medic, whom would give me some. I would take only enough each day that I didn't go into withdrawal. I'd still have some resistance to pain and detachment from reality, but not a lot. I was pretty much always at least a little bit high. Still am. ;) Right before a big confrontation I would shoot up a bunch to completely get rid of pain whatsoever.

markevens,starcraft,1390453558.0,"There are 3 components to starcraft

* Economy
* Infrastructure
* Army

Having a better economy than your opponent gives you the opportunity to have a better infrastructure and army than them.   Having better infrastructure means you will be able to take better advantage of your economy and get a bigger/better army.  Army is really dependent on your economy and infrastructure, and at lower levels it is usually a numbers game.  He with the most dudes wins.  


These are also the 3 targets to attack.  

* Attacking the enemy economy means they will have a smaller/weaker army, or unable to take advantage of infrastructure investment.  
* Attacking enemy infrastructure means the opponent cannot take full advantage of their economy, and having to reinvest in their infrastructure instead of army units.
* Army vs Army is the fun stuff but unless you know you are going to get the kill, it isn't all that advantageous to continue an attack.  


Economy and infrastructure (and creating your army) are the boring parts that we call ""Macro.""  

Controlling the army is what we call ""Micro."" 

The micro is the fun stuff and we like to focus there, but if the enemy outnumbers you then you will probably die.  This is why having a foundation in macro is so important.  

If you have good macro, you will outnumber your opponent and win in pretty much every lower league game.  You can have fun with army control.  In the higher leagues micro starts becoming more important because you opponent and you will both have an equal foundation of macro.  Without that foundation, there isn't much you can do micro-wise to win. 

This is pretty long winded, but I just wanted to really illustrate why macro is so important not just tell you to learn to macro. 

That said, I value [filtersc's youtube guides](http://www.youtube.com/user/filtersc/videos?view=1&amp;flow=grid) the best.  Nothing fancy, but his benchmark method of learning and pushing yourself to get better is the best I've seen."

* Vaseline Advanced Lip Therapy
* It has maybe the faintest hint of creamsicle (vanilla &amp; orange), which I'm guessing is to neutralize the natural scent of Vaseline, but when you get down to it, the flavor/scent is as neutral as they come
* Not tinted
* I use it on a nightly basis (quite liberally), while prepping to put on makeup (I use it to soften &amp; prep my lips, then I wipe it off before applying lip liner), and maybe a couple times a day if it's particularly dry out
* No SPF. Alas!
* I LOVE that this leaves my lips so well hydrated, soft, and smooth. I also love that it's not medicated or minty, because in the long run, those types of lip balms actually break down tissues, forcing you into a cycle of constant re-application. It's way silky, considering that it's an intensive therapy formula, and it's smooth instead of sticky or greasy. Finally, it's way cheap- I picked up a couple tubes at Target today for less than a dollar a pop. Holla!
* It's a super basic balm- no color, no scent, so it's not necessarily going to be a favorite for going out or for made up days that call for lippy goodness. To add to that, it allows feathering if you later tinted balms, glosses, or lipsticks over it. Just don't do it."

tzivje,AskWomen,1390453886.0,"Pros: 

I am willing to try new things and embark on adventures with you (sports, travel, interest groups).

I will be your personal restaurant. I can cook very well, and our meals will never be same-old.

I am funny....and I don't mind some crude humor.

I would consider myself an interesting person: educated, well-read, well-traveled, friendly, multilingual, physically active, rich family life, etc.

I take responsibility for things. I won't become dependent upon you unless the situation calls for it. I can lead my own life, but love having you around because it makes me happy. I'll come up with ideas for fun things to do. I'll keep up my end of the conversation if you keep up yours.

I'm also good and just being with you, and not doing anything at all.

Cons:

Sometimes I need some solid ground in my life. I tend to change things a lot, just because an opportunity arises. 

I have a toddler. She is very sweet, and I do want a sibling or two for her. (pro/con?)

I go through phases of being very socially active - being the life of the party and being the one to organize all the activities, send out invites, and host events. And then sometimes I withdraw and lose touch with friends for a few months, and mostly just see family and my SO.

Sometimes I'm not very good at sleeping, and will just want to read in bed all night long.

 Sometimes I worry too much.

I don't really like watching movies or TV."
gantt5,AskPhysics,1390453886.0,"DoctorJ and clade_nade both make very good points (some of which will be repeated). +1 to both.

Physics undergrad, medical physics grad student here. Take as many applied math classes as you can fit in your schedule. Proofs probably won't help you as much as something like vector analysis or linear algebra unless you want to do theory. Find out who the *good* professors (not the easy ones) are and take it with them. You might not do as well, but you will learn so much more. Make sure you have a solid understanding of differential equations and Fourier analysis by the time you start your upper-level classes (E&amp;M, quantum, and beyond).

If you have trouble with the math in a physics class, most professors will be happy to help you during office hours. TAs may be a little less patient, but if they see that you have legitimately tried before showing up most will help you. When asking for help in office hours, try to avoid asking direct questions about homework because it will come off as you fishing for answers. Instead, ask similar problems or just focus on the math, and then ask how that can be applied to the assigned problems.

That said, your professors aren't out to get you. They're not going to throw you in the deep end and watch you sink. They're going to make sure you're ready for whatever they're teaching. I had professors ask the class on more than one occasion if we had been taught the math we needed for a particular topic. If the class said no, they stopped and taught it to us on the spot.

Put a big focus on modern physics. All the universities I know about teach special relativity in that course, and you'll be using that a lot. Particle interactions covered in that course also plays a large role in stellar astrophysics. Mine covered some spectral analysis as well, which is everything in astrophysics research.

I went straight into a physics BS at a major university never having had calculus. I doubled up on my math courses for three semesters (linear algebra &amp; calc 1, vector analysis &amp; calc 2, diff eq &amp; calc 3) to catch up, and then I maintained one math class per semester the rest of my time there. I was a little confused the first couple of weeks when we would talk about differentials in physics while we were still covering limits in calc 1, but it was ultimately not detrimental. 

When you get to quantum, don't let the notation throw you. It will seem weird and unnecessarily complicated at first. However, one day you will work a problem and everything will just fall into place and the notation will suddenly make sense. From then on, quantum will be 1000x easier.

Try to get with a professor earlier rather than later, especially since you know what you want to do research on. Go see them during their office hours or make an appointment. Try to find some of their recent publications and at least read the abstracts before you talk with them. "

Mephrael,AskReddit,1390453980.0,"&gt; that it was based on transporter/replicator tech.

This seems.... like a very power hungry technology. It also seems somewhat ethically ambiguous for people created to interact with. You'd theoretically be creating a functional human being through the matter transference tech in a transporter, and then dissolving them, not just when the program is deactivated, but also when they move out of the frame of the physical room the holodeck is contained in. It would also indicate that once created, the people or objects made in the room would be able to be taken outside the room, which I'm fairly sure never happens.

Note: I'm aware of Voyager's holographic doctor, but the medbay on that ship class had an embedded holo-suite in it. AFAIK he never leaves the medbay.


Edit: I just read this [rather helpful Wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodeck) which explains it in quite good detail, though I can't understand why they'd use replicator resources for objects like furniture, when they can simulate something as sophisticated as a person using shaped force fields.

I have never had an eating disorder, but you can do the math and see my BMI is lower than considered healthy.  And yet...I'm perfectly healthy.  I'll point out that women need to have a body fat of at least 16% (IIRC) to ovulate.  If she got pregnant, she was ovulating and thus doesn't have near ""zero percent body fat.""  

She didn't say that she sits on her bum all day, eats potato chips, and magically lost her baby weight.  While she did say she didn't have a structured workout, she mentions an ""active lifestyle"" and at least goes on walks in the snow with a stroller.  She isn't doing *nothing*.  

I don't really think the responsibility should lie with the OP.  Just because this plan works for her doesn't mean one should assume it'll be a good plan for them.  Someone with a larger frame is never going to be tiny, so looking at a pic of a stranger online and thinking it's obtainable is illogical.  If such a post would really be that triggering, they should seek professional help so they can maintain good mental and physical health.  Anorexia is a serious condition, but it's not on OP to deal with that unless she's actively pushing unhealthy choices like a restricted diet or extreme exercise.  She isn't doing any of those things; she just has some motivation and, more likely, good genetics. 

Are you saying only bigger women should post PP wt loss pics?  That's unfair, since not all women have bigger frames and aren't the only example of ""real"", either. Or only ones you deem ""healthy-looking"" enough?  Women come in all shapes and sizes.  As mentioned, some are ""rail thin"" and are not any less of a woman because if it.

Here's a choice quote:

&gt;The greek word κύριος means ruler/master; kyriarchy means, quite literally, rulership by the master, or possibly beginning from the master. Master is left vague on purpose; there are so many of them that to have a comprehensive list, it’d take more than a few volumes.

The teapot has a few rough spots which act as nucleation sites, so the water will boil. Even so, I've managed to get it hot enough for it to boil over when I add the tea basket, so even if you have nucleation sites, keep an eye on it.

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1390454309.0,"The best examples I can think of are when I compare how I was treated as a teenager vs. how I'm treated *in the exact same situations* as an adult.

Example 1: As a teenager, I was treated like a thief like 80% of the time I went shopping. One time I picked out a greeting card then headed to the wrapping paper section (in the opposite direction of the door to the store) and had an employee yell at me for not paying for the card.  In comparison, as an adult, I'm treated like a valued customer.  I've asked store employees to take security tags off clothes before I tried them on (the location of the tag affected the fit) and they do so cheerfully.  

Example 2: I have a severe phobia of bugs. When I was a kid and a teen, my parents would tell me to stop whining.  Now that I'm an adult, those same parents volunteer to help me scrupulously clean up apartments before I move in and acquire insecticide spray with the label removed so I don't see the icky pictures of bugs on the label and warn me if I need to avoid a certain movie or TV show or newspaper article.

Example 3: As a teen, if I was a fan of something, elders would roll their eyes at it or assume I'm just into it because it's trendy rather than because it's interesting (even if it isn't actually trendy - they'd assume I'd only be into trendy things). Now, if I'm into something, the same elders aren't disparaging of it. If I get to go to a concert, their attitude is ""I'm glad you got to do something that makes you happy!"" If I mention I'm into a TV show, they might say ""I'll have a look at it, I'm in the market for a new series.""  And the strange part is some of these are the **exact same things** that they were disparaging when I was a teen (examples: The Simpsons, the comedy of Eddie Izzard, the music of Cake)."

ActingPower,AskScienceFiction,1390454328.0,"Really? Not one person says the right answer? It's obvious, really. He does it because he thinks he can trick the gods again.

The story of Sisyphus, for those of you who've forgotten: he died in the prime of his life. But before he passed to Hades, he asked of the gods, ""Please, allow me to return to life one last time! I believe my wife has been unfaithful to my memory, and I need to go up there and punish her!"" So the gods let him do so. Little did they know that this was all planned, both by him and his wife. When the gods found out, they were furious, but there wasn't much they could do.

When Sisyphus died for the second time, the gods came to him again. ""Sisyphus,"" they said, ""we have a special offer for you. If you want to escape from the underworld again, all you have to do is roll this boulder up to the top of this mountain. Do that, and you can return to life.""

Sisyphus was obviously pleased with this. The rock was heavy, but he worked his absolute hardest. Well, you know the rest. Just as he got up to the top, his purchase slipped, and the boulder rolled all the way to the bottom. ""That is no matter,"" he thought to himself. ""I only need to start again, and I will defeat the gods once more."" So he tries again and again, unaware of how may times he has tried in the past, simply because he wants to win so badly that he will keep on trying until he succeeds. A perfect example of the sunk cost fallacy if I've ever seen one."

Looking at video of what's happening in Kiev, their police force is really under-geared and inept.

New York City alone probably spends as much on police and counter-terrorism in a year than all of Ukraine.

Violent protesters don't stand a chance in America nowadays. At least not in major cities. Maybe in Detroit.

Another thing that is driving the protests in Ukraine is increasingly draconian government laws, including forbidding people to assemble by the Parliament building.

This is something that governments have been doing forever, so it is forbidden for the government to prohibit it in the American Bill of Rights.

&gt; Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

p3ndulum,fantasybball,1390454637.0,"He's done a little bit of pboth; backing Lowry up as well as getting time along side of him.

Raptors have been running with an 8-man rotation for the most part since the Rudy Gay trade - Lowry, Vasquez, DeRozan, Ross, Salmons, Patterson, Johnson and Valunciunis, with Hayes, Landry and Novak sprinkled in occasionally.

Vasquez has fit in to the system from the very first game he played in a Raptor uniform. It just took a couple of games for the rest of the team to acclimate to Vasquez's timing on his passes.

Also, the Raptors have been moving the ball much, much better since the trade, and assists are going up across the roster. They are getting a lot of clean looks, and Vasquez has been benefiting by getting to take some wide open 3s. And because defenses have been breaking down due to the ball movement, he's been able to get into the paint a little bit where he's been successful with his running tear drop lay up.

He looks good in Dwayne Casey's system, and there are rumours that the Raptors are looking to trade Lowry (I wouldn't), and if that happens, Vasquez might get a promotion - which would be good news for Vasquez owners, especially the ones in deeper leagues."

tehsuigi,toronto,1390454888.0,"&gt;Everyone should know that John Tory is the chair of [CivicAction](http://www.civicaction.ca/regional-transportation), a non-profit that lead a big 'My32' campaign last year (e.g. what would you do with a saved 32 mins each day if we expanded transit).

Which unfortunately is a  misinterpretation of the study results. It's not that you would save 32 minutes each day with expanded transit - it's that if we *don't* build expanded transit, your commute would get, on average, 32 minutes *worse*.

Even if we built the entire Big Move plan, on time and on budget, our commute times in 2031 would only stay the same as it is now and avoid getting any worse. Improving commute times? Lot more transit, both rapid and local.

What you're proposing is for more interesting and complex. Essentially a multi-dimenstional visual map of gender perceptions and gendered traits accross cultures.

Hoodwink,MensRights,1390455005.0,"The risk pools were shifted so that young men had to pay more after feminists said that insurers couldn't discriminate by gender.  In addition, prices for the over 50 people remained pretty much the same.  The ACA was intended to save the health insurance industry in this way because it would be too expensive to take care of the boomers and it would price out many of them (insurer's were afraid of market forces creating a P.R. disaster that would ultimately doom them).  

The risk pool costs were shifted to primarily young men, specifically, middle-class men because they're the ones who aren't going to be on medicaid or going without healthcare.  We probably haven't seen it priced in fully yet, though.  But the numbers about who signed up for the ACA don't look good for the original theory.  The talk about ''young invincibles'' not signing up is primarily aimed at young men who did not have health insurance suddenly deciding that they have enough money to spend on health insurance.  The incomes of said brackets of said population that the ACA is dependent on has been on a serious decline (and as I said before, young women are more able to actually foot the bill than young women can according to economic data - so there was no reason for the feminists to get involved in making gender discrimination illegal in health insurance).

The counter-point is that the ACA has subsidies and men will get more subsidies because their incomes are lower.  I think this neglects a social awareness about the pressure for males to show status symbols, pay for social outings, and to take risks in business.  Anybody with any clue and social sense could predict that young males wouldn't sign up for the ACA because they have more to gain by putting their money elsewhere.  

I'm still waiting for feminists to make a law to make it illegal for other types of insurance to discriminate by gender (specifically those that favor women).  I think we'll be waiting for a long time.."

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390455090.0,"Ok, tightness and bulges vs. size.  No images, but I have a run down.

If your bra is comfortably stretching (meaning applying firm pressure, but not hoarking on it) to a size bigger than your ribcage, but still feels uncomfortably tight, it's a pretty good sign the cups are too small and your breasts are pushing out on the band.  Try your bras on with the cups on your back to see how they feel without cups muddying the waters.

Back bulges are generally caused by one of two things, a) you have quite a lot of fat around your ribcage, and the band has to dig deeply into it to get any purchase (unlikely in the extreme in a 32 size.  This is really only the case with larger band sizes), or b) Your band is just slightly too loose to support your breasts, and the weight of them in the front pulls the front of the band down and the back of the band up, where it pushes flesh around as it slide.  You don't see it when a much too big band rides up, because it just slides over your skin, but when an only slightly too big one does it, it shoves stuff around.  This is even more likely to happen when your cups are too small or shallow, because then your wires are being pushed below the intramammary fold, pulling the back up.

It is common to have a slight indentation where your bra sits, just as you would have from the waistband of jeans or the tops of tight socks, but if it's painful, the bra does not fit.

We nurse a little in bed. Sometimes we can both go back to sleep for another hour, sometimes we get up 10 minutes later.

If we get up, we see Daddy off to work around 6:30.

I get toddler some rice krispies and put her in the high chair. She watches an episode of a German or Russian kids show while I make coffee, unload the dishwasher, and have a cup of yogurt.

After we eat and the episode is over, we will get dressed, clean up, and brush teeth.

More coffee. Play time. Tea party, reading books, more coffee.

around 8:30 toddler will be ready for a nap. We will cuddle while she falls asleep. I'll either read in bed while she naps, or catch up on laundry, dishes, dusting, pooping, drinking coffee....

Those things will happen for an hour or two. Usually around 11a we go to the library, go swimming at the ymca, go grocery shopping, see a friend, go for a walk. In the summer/above freezing seasons, we will go running with the jogging stroller and go to a playground.

My thoughts exactly. I'm currently planning my wedding fro 100 people, and budgeting $8000. This is considered a ""cheap"" wedding by an industry that says $20-$30,000 is the norm.

We are paying for half, parents are paying for the other half. And we are saving money in addition to paying for the wedding.

Going into debt over it? Hell no."

btown_brony,comeonandslam,1390455348.0,"Thanks for the constructive criticism. I actually had Libera Me From Slam on repeat on my iTunes as I was making this video! (Just marathonned Gurren Lagann this weekend - one of the most epic-scale, blood-pumping shows I've ever seen, just saying.) And that is an incredible slam.

I'm obligated to mention that in the video you mentioned, the ""tertiary source"" (I assume you mean the ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWER rap) [is actually an integral part of the song from the show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT6LFOIofRE). As far as I can tell, this setting of the classic Roman Catholic text was specifically composed for Gurren Lagann by Taku Iwasaki and performed by Japanese soprano Yuri Kasahara and rappers Tarantula. If there was another composer responsible for the setting, please let me know! It's one of my favorite songs. But if my assumptions about the composers are correct - the styles weren't ""seemingly different"" after all.

Oh, and [watch TTGL RIGHT NOW](http://www.animetycoon.net/gurren-lagann-episode-1/)! (VideoValley embeds work best.) Don't just trust me - trust in the Barkley that believes in you!"

In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe.

kempff,Catholicism,1390455574.0,"&gt;  Eastside Catholic prides itself on teaching acceptance.

I didn't know that's what schools were for.

&gt; At the end of Crusader Way, by the school’s entrance, banners hang celebrating “relationships” and exhorting passers-by to “remember to take care of each other.” Students use a sign-language gesture to remind one another of the school’s emphasis on unconditional love.

I wonder if anybody hung banners celebrating African-American babies and exhorting people to remember the black holocaust using the sign-language gesture for ""abortion"" today.

It's Wednesday, January 22, 2014 - do you know where two thirds of your unborn children are?

&gt; The ouster of Mr. Z, as the former vice principal, Mark Zmuda, is known, comes amid a wave of firings and forced resignations of gay men and lesbians from Roman Catholic institutions across the country.... But for some young Catholics, the firings are mystifying, particularly given the new tone set by Pope Francis. 

A wave coinciding with the legalization of gay marriage state by state. But that can't be significant, because the article would have made that connection if it were.

Mystifying indeed.

&gt; This month, the band and choir director at a Catholic school in Ohio was fired...

You'd think the mainstream media would be more careful about reinforcing stereotypes.

&gt; Eastside’s senior-class president, Bradley Strode, a 17-year-old wrestler and lacrosse player...

So a straight-ally. Or is that another stereotype?

&gt; “It was just shocking that the Catholic Church would turn its back on a teacher for something that didn’t affect his work performance,” he said. 

Because it boils down to job performance in spite of his personal life? Seriously?

Gorptastic,WritingPrompts,1390455872.0,"This happens inside a medical tent. The smell of rotting flesh drives out anyone not immediately tending to the dying soldiers of the Battle of Sarbony. 

Nurses place wet rags over their mouths to cope with the smell. The smell is all you can think about inside the tent. It's a smell that Death himself will avoid. Inside the tent, there is no conception of time. The makeshift leather flaps and wooden beams were constructed two days ago however, and many soldiers took their last breaths filled with the putrid air inside of it.

Tonight, amid the groaning and shuddering of the half-soldiers, a strange guest entered the tent. The man appeared no older than many of the boys he stooped over. He examined their mortal wounds. His eyes ran over their bodies like an onlooker marvels at a car accident. He doesn't recognize the decaying, gangrenous piece of organic tissue laying on each cot as human. How it can still talk amazes him.

The man himself was strangely dressed for a battlefield. His black suit and white dress shirt was unsullied by the mud and grime from outside the tent. His shoes might have been polished yesterday. He wore a grey fedora and carried a pipe in his breast pocket. In his hands were a notepad and felt-tipped plume pen.

""Excuse me sir! I hate to trouble you, are you able to talk?"" He leaned in close to one of the better-looking rotting soldiers. ""Nurse, is he asleep? Very well then, the boy deserves every minute of rest. God bless them.""

The man in the suit approached another soldier. Batting flies away from the unstitched wound in the sinews of his leg, the man cleared his throat.

""Ahem. Pardon me sir. My name is Franklin Pound, Ministry of Census. If it's not inconvenient for you, sir, I'd like a minute of your time.""

The soldier lifted his arm like a dead weight. It rose in the air and then fell limply over his stomach. His hand was a most pitiable shade of purple and yellow, wrote Franklin Pound on his notepad.

""What is your name, sir?"" Inquired Franklin Pound, the man in the suit and hat.

""Timothy... Pake."" The soldier gasped.

""Very good, this will only take a minute, sir. I'm collecting information for the government. A ghastly time our side has had in the War. They say we're fighting for democracy, and frankly I believe that is a cause worth fighting for. They say we need our young boys now more than ever, but we don't turn our backs on God and we don't turn our backs on our countrymen, they say. They want fellows like me to go out onto the scene, the battlefield I mean, and get a record of all the young boys out here. What regiment, platoon, and rank are you sir?""

The soldier smacked his dry mouth. Laying on his back, he decided instead to lean to the side, just enough for the man in the suit to get a glance at his rank stitched onto his uniform. The soldier wheezed, grasping at the blood seeping out of his stomach, his frayed leg meaning very little at this moment. Finally, he found himself lying at an angle, resting all his weight on one shoulder.

""Oh my, I see what you're trying to do, sir."" Said Pound, feeling a twinge of sympathy for the soldier. Even though the soldier had completed his maneuver of shifting his weight to his shoulder, Pound asked anyway, ""Do you need help moving your uniform, sir?""

Pound jotted down the symbol etched onto the man's uniform, inwardly embarrassed not to know what it stood for. ""Very good sir. Congratulations and well done with that rank there, sir. Next question. Where are you from? I mean, where did you grow up as a boy? The government cares a lot about that, sir. That way we can get an estimate of where next to conscript a group of boys, sir. If you don't mind me asking of course, sir.""

The soldier's mind briefly threw himself backward in time to when he lived with his family. He was a different person altogether then. Was that boy better off than he, not to have known pain and sickness and misery the world over? No, this is just self-pity, just weakness, the soldier chided himself faintly.

""Buh..."" Gulped the soldier, his throat now dry and choking on the pestilence inside the tent. ""B..""

""Yes, what is it, sir?"" Asked Pound, edging closer to catch the words as they tried to escape the dying soldier's mouth. Then, Pound had a better idea. ""How about you write it down on my notepad, sir? Can you write? Of course you can, that's a good boy! Our government should feel proud to rear children who are strong and intelligent! You make our government proud, sir, do you know that?""

It was little use, however, as the moment Pound handed his pen to the dying soldier, the soldier's hand began trembling. He fumbled with the pen for a moment, and it fell onto the muddy ground.

Pound looked at his clean clothes, sighed, and said, ""Oh dear. This won't do at all. That was my last pen. I know you tried your best, sir, and that's all that matters, isn't it? Well, I think I will go talk to the nurse and see if we can't give you something better to rest your head upon. God bless you for what you have sacrificed to our great country, sir! Farewell... Tommy Pake! Best of luck to you!""

Then, Pound tucked his notepad within the hem of his suit pants and strode for the exit. Leaving the tent, he gasped a breath of fresher air. ""What a poor kid. He's in there dying and won't get to see how important he is for his country. If I were in his place, I would have felt proud to have placed my life before the cause!""

With such assurances, Pound smiled and flipped out his notepad again. Out of his suit pocket he pulled another pen, identical to the one the soldier dropped in the mud. Before leaving camp he had the good foresight to bring extras. He was a good man, the best of them. He was a Census man."

I said that with regards to the transactions of drug money taking place. It seemed quite obvious to me that this was the topic of my argument.

I possess a basic understanding of how money laundering functions, as well as the necessary obstacles it presents to those who are watching for it. My query is whether or not HSBC--one of the biggest banks worldwide--was aware of these activities at some level and thus *intentionally* cast its gaze elsewhere. I do not think that I have set the goalposts so far apart as to deserve ridicule and dismissal from you."

They were lenient on me because it was my first offense, and if you bothered to look into my comment history, you'd see this may or may not be one of the lesser of many evils I have done to others in my time on this earth. Many of which I'd have never been convicted of.  I hope others wouldn't consider it bragging.  Faced with possibly having to account, at least in some moderately anonymous way, for my choices allows me to see how far my life has gone in the nearly 30 years I've been alive, and how far off I've allowed myself to wander from a good path because I was too selfish and scared to act in a manner that I could really be proud of.  

 If even half of those things I might have done are true, then I was a much worse human being than you can possibly imagine, and I will probably never even the scales enough to be able to call myself as kind, positive, and respectful an individual as you.  

Be glad you can say you're such an incredible person, and grateful that you didn't have to become one of the worst versions of yourself to have to truly understand how important it is to empathize, because it is only through our empathy that we can understand how to give others what they need when they need it, and hopefully spread that empathy to others.

Stay Classy."

It's still a beautiful country, though. The main draw for me was seeing a country that's still very much traditional, as it only started opening itself to modern creations (i.e. television) in the last couple of decades. There is definitely a cultural mindset of preservation - preserving their culture, religion, and even their environment.

The many *dzongs* (temple/fortresses) are gorgeously constructed with a lot of attention paid to detailed carvings and painted artwork. Add in the many strings and poles of multi-coloured prayer flags and you have great photo ops. The Tiger's Nest in particular was breathtaking (and not just because of the altitude...) and totally worth the aching calves I had the day after the hike. Also, the interior of the main worshiping hall in the Punakha Dzong was probably almost as gorgeous as St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City (but far less tourists, so you can actually take your time to walk around and admire everything instead of being pushed along by crowds). We were also really lucky when we stopped at the Dochula Pass, because there weren't any clouds obscuring a great panoramic of Gangkhar Puensum and the surrounding Himalayan mountains.

However, it's not exactly a cheap place to travel to and you don't have too much freedom, as you *must* travel with a licensed tour guide and you *must* have some sort of itinerary worked out before you get there. There is no such thing as ""winging it"" in Bhutan (at least, not at this time). The food was also not great, mostly buffet style for tourists, where it's questionable how fresh the food is or if it was kept at the correct temperature to prevent food poisoning. If you go, also be prepared for narrow, bumpy, winding roads right on the sides of mountains.

On one last interesting note, there is *a lot* of phallic imagery around Bhutan."

I don't get how people can just fart at one another like that and do the other gross things they do. Deliberately trying to make people smell nasty stuff is so rude and disrespectful, yet they have totally normalized nasty behaviors like that. They are completely unrelateable. I watched a bit in the beginning because I was morbidly curious about how anyone could live with such a lack of manners and I had already had a taste of their appalling behavior on Toddlers and Tiaras but after the first handful of episodes I just couldn't take it anymore. It made me miss civilized society way too much and just makes me want to be even more reclusive than I already am since I live in the south too and really don't want to deal with people like this face to face.

They don't seem like bad people but they operate so far outside the normal bounds of decency that it's uncomfortable to watch. It makes me sad to see the little girl raised like that. It was appalling enough seeing her given energy drinks for the beauty pageants before they got their own show, but seeing the rest of how she lives really breaks my heart because I just can't fathom how someone raised with so few normal boundaries can transition into fitting in with society. She seems like she's just being set up to always be the butt of everyone's jokes. What happens when she's old enough to realize most people are laughing at her / her family and not with them? I wouldn't want to be the laughingstock of the country. Small things seemed immensely mortifying when I was a teenager and I can't even imagine how much worse it would be to literally have people across the country making fun of my whole life."

As a CAM you see all of Neymar's good qualities used. You do not have to be FIFARalle to take advantage of his 5* skills, doing running scoopturns and such. Or if you are not even willing to do any skills at all, his ball control and dribbling still means that you are able to weave through traffic.

I used the Hunter chem style on him which increases his Pace and Shooting. The pace... man it is nothing short of erotic, yes homo. I have had him blaze past even pacey CBs such as Chiellini and Koscelny. From there he can finesse it into the far corner from the left or right in the most sexy way imaginable.

jaynay1,nba,1390456659.0,"So this is complicated, but I don't think Aldridge is even close to 3rd place.  I honestly wouldn't put him on my ballot at all assuming I can only vote for 3 or 5 players, whichever it is.

Advanced statistics struggle with volume shooters, which LMA, easily the league leader in FGA, certainly is.

That said, the prevailing explanation for this is that the offense is built, via Stotts, around LMA's ""strong"" midrange shot.

So theoretically then, LMA's ORtg should be off the charts high, right?  I mean Portland's the best offense in the league and they revolve around him, so they should be extremely good when he's on the court and worse when he's off it since the offense is built around him, right?

Nope.  

The Portland offense averages 114.1 Ortg, and LMA's is actually lower than this, at 111.

""Oh, but that applies to every star playing against higher level competition, right?""

Nope.

Here's a small table:

||Team Ortg|Player Ortg
---|---|---
James|110.8|121.9
Durant|109.2|124.4
Lillard|114.1|119.4
Paul|109.5|123.3
Davis|107.8|118.1
Dragic|108.1|117.2
Isaiah Thomas|106.6|117.1

All of those cases, some of them not even going to make the ASG, are above their team average while participating in a heavy role.

Not only that, but out of the 20 most common TrailBlazers lineups, Aldridge appears in 12 of them.  In 7 of those, he's with Lillard.  In 5 he isn't.

6 of the 7 he's with Lillard, the Portland offense is above average.  The 5 without are 1 above average and 4 below.  Lillard suffers from a similar problem.

Not only that, but the Trailblazers are succeeding more on the extreme strength of their starting 5.  I believe their starting 5 may have the highest combined WS/48 by virtue of lack of a weak link, but that would require pretty significant effort.

That is, LMA is getting a lot of credit for the Trailblazers resurgence, but shouldn't be getting enough of it to be getting into the MVP discussion, as the other 4 positions around him all improved.

One more table and then I'll be done:

|WS/48|Last Year|This Year
|---|---|---|
PG|.088|.180
SG|.093|.165
SF|.099|.132
PF|.124|.172
C|.142|.155

Every single position has seen marked improvement, but none as clear as Lillard, who at this point I would argue is the most valuable player on this team (Since he's the actual greater offensive force of himself and LMA, and they're both minus defenders).

tl;dr, LMA's strength is kind of a myth because he looks like the best player in Portland(And he may well be.  It's close between him and Lillard).  In actuality the whole starting 5 is playing very well."

Posted on guard duty for visiting WWE members doing a publicity event? ""Provided personal protection for VIP's""

 A [.50 BMG](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Rifle_cartridge_comparison.jpg) (the big one) Has a muzzle velocity of 2,900 FPS at sea level, nearly 3 times faster that it needs to be moving to break the sound barrier (1128 fps at sea level). as we all (hopefully) know, an object moving faster than the speed of sound causes a sonic boom, which is *[continuously caused by the object](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1rh337/)* until it because subsonic. a .50 BMG round goes subsonic at around 1500 - 2000 yards (depending on a lot of things).  

The sonic boom caused by the bullet is the loudest part of a gunshot and louder than the gun powder detonation ***by far***.  Meaning you *Will* hear the gun shot unless you out of the audible range of the sonic boom which will be much farther than 2,000 yard from the shooter. 

However, at these kind of ranges, you will only hear the gunshot *after* impact to the target.

komnenos,videos,1390456925.0,"Its still doing quite well compared to Mao's/Chiang Kai-shek's regime.  And only a generation ago practically everyone was a peasant, now hundreds of millions are middle class.  

One such example is my girlfriend and her family.  When she was little she and her parents would get around by bike if they wanted to get to the other side of town (her hometown of Fuzhou has a huge river separating the city) they had to take a ferry or schooner.  Now her parents have two cars and their city finally after thousands of years has a bridge across it.  

I know this is one small example but to me whats striking is how her family was middle class beforehand as well, her parents are both doctors yet as little as 15 years ago they had to ride bikes because a car was too expensive.  Of course they are one small example, I know that hundreds of millions of Chinese are facing poverty, I know that there is an impending housing crisis among other things. For me when I wrote my previous comment I was trying to convey that China was doing ""okay.""  Yes there are lots of ways they could improve but everything considering I think they are doing alright.  There are no large scale revolts, I doubt there is going to be any Taiping rebellion or a return to the time when warlords owned vast swaths of China.  And unless something drastic happens (which might since the world is ever changing) I doubt that we will see any true Maoist ""reforms.""

So I know I've rambled and if there is anything you'd wish to discuss I'd be happy to discuss, but in my view considering everything I think that China is doing okay.

Let's be honest here though, he physically cheated on you and if he didn't it's because he didn't get the opportunity to see her. He knows it, she knows it, and you know it.

MrFace1,nfl,1390457154.0,"Every time we get bounced from the playoffs this ridiculous subject comes up. It has no relevance at all to the situation. 

It's absurd that you people cling to these ignorant statements so that you may have a reason to hate the Patriots. Hate them, nobody really cares, but at least study up on the subject before you make stupid statements like these.

Here are some facts for you.

* Bill Cowher, Jimmy Johnson admit that they've done the same thing

* The fines weren't because of how bad the rule break was. They were because the rule was broken right after the NFL sent a memo out not to do it.

* The only problem was what the signals were taped with and the location of the taping. They were taped with a device the NFL decided was not allowed. From the NFL's Constitution &amp; Bylaws (article 9): ""Any use by any club at any time, from the start to the finish of any game in which such club is a participant, of any communications or information-gathering equipment, other than Polaroid-type cameras or field telephones, shall be prohibited, including without limitation videotape machines, telephone tapping, or bugging devices, or any other form of electronic devices that might aid a team during the playing of a game."" They could only tape from a specific enclosed and windowed environment.

* [Mangini regrets saying anything about the taping because of how incredibly overblown it was](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/05/01/eric-mangini-regrets-turning-in-the-patriots-over-spygate/)

* [Jets were caught doing the same thing but nobody cares about that](http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3151217)

* Nobody believes the Patriots could have used the videotape during games. There’s no way they could get the camera guy into the locker room, break down the tape, relay the information to the coaching staff, and then relay the information to Tom Brady (who would have to know, since he would be the one who would have to change the play based on the signals he saw) during HALFTIME. How long do you people think halftime is? The signals were basically stolen in the hope that the team they were facing would be daft enough to keep the same signals in their next meeting. This is an unlikely at best idea.


Using spygate as an excuse to debase the Patriots' success is incredibly lazy and is a mark of an uneducated and just simply ignorant ""fan"" of football.

panda_burrr,relationship_advice,1390457196.0,"I had the same issue with my first boyfriend in that I had a hard time trusting people after he and I broke up. He lied to me about loving me, and he said that he had been wanting to break up with me 4 or 5 months before he actually broke up with me. In the months to follow, I hated everyone and I hated people for telling me they thought I was cute or pretty, I thought they were only telling me this because they wanted sex from me or that they were just going to lie to me eventually. But eventually, after talking to a counselor for a bit, it helped me come to the realization that not everyone is the same, and you have to treat everyone as a separate individual. Just because someone has hurt you in the past, it doesn't mean that someone else will. You can't generalize from one relationship to another because people are different. I know it might be hard to trust people initially (even I still have trust issues), but time really will heal it if you put in the effort.

Honestly, I can't really tell you how to cope with all of the shit your ex brought upon you, everyone copes in a different way. I hope you talk to someone (preferably a professional) about it, counseling is very therapeutic and really allows you to open up about a lot and put all of your thoughts out in front of you, if that makes any sense. Another thing to do is keep yourself distracted by hanging out with your friends and doing fun things that keep you interacted. Try to keep away from drinking as it can escalate to emotional breakdowns (trust me, I've been there), or other harmful things.

I know it might seem pointless to say this, but you need to keep yourself away from him, he sounds like a very toxic person to be around, and even if he does happen to get his shit together, I still wouldn't ever trust him again.

I'm really sorry that something like that happened, it sounds really devastating :/ but you can get over this! you will get over this!"

Hob Goblin and Ozai can fly, while Luke not only has a lightsaber to keep him at bay physically, but from the Episode One we see that Jedi can overcome most inhaled toxins.

3rd down: Hob Goblin.  Too reliant on the glider that can be disabled by the two remaining combatants.  Once the tech is gone, he's not a great fighter and would be outclassed.

Between Ozai and Luke, I think Luke wins 7/10 times.  Ozai may be a master bender, but he's also insane and susceptible to a mind trick.  Luke recognizes crazy and would know better than to rush Ozai.  Only way Ozai offs him is if Luke were distracted or injured by the other combatants."

I find it extremely refreshing to see someone put being a stay-at-home mom in the same discussion as female objectification and wage gap.  I feel like this discussion gets lost sometimes.  If you're trying to be a career woman, society and men will get on you for being ambitious.  If you just want to be a mom and that's your dream, SOMEONE is going to call you out eventually for holding women back by filling such a traditional role.  It makes me happy to see other people standing up for all life path choices and desires, not just the ones that break tradition.  Now if only we could shake this idea that we represent all women in our chosen life path.  I don't know about you guys, but sometimes I feel like I have to be super successful at whatever path I choose because now that I've chosen it, I have to prove I am capable and I chose well."

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1390457602.0,"In my personal experience, the more insecure I feel, the more I compare myself to others. It's a cheap way for me to comfort myself with self pity instead of actually addressing the things I'm insecure about so that I can be more confident. (For me it's about money and career.)

Write your thoughts out in a journal instead of letting toxic thoughts float around in your head. Just put it on paper to get it out of your system and move on. 

My thoughts about others tend to mirror how I feel about myself. For instance, if I'm down on myself, I find myself trying to find ways to bring down others in my mind. Originally, I admire people who seem better off than me, but the jealousy makes me want to find fault with them. So the way that I've addressed this is that I try to boost myself and others up at the same time. I congratulate other people for their accomplishments and I try to compliment them because it makes me feel better about myself, rather than feeling like a grumpy poop. Then I try to be more of a cheerleader for myself as well. The less I focus on other people's faults, the less I focus on my own. 

I try to look more into the big picture of people's lives and train myself to appreciate people just for being who they are. I might dislike x,y, or z about a person but I try to focus on the stuff I can appreciate about them. That helps me give myself more credit as well instead of focusing on my flaws. 

Edit: Oh, and another thing. I stopped waiting around wishing people would give me credit for my good attributes. It only made me feel bitter and resentful that I felt overlooked. You should always be your own biggest fan. No amount of support or positive feedback from other people will mean anything if you aren't supportive of yourself. "

In tests they start with one new red ball, which they have the option to replace after 80 overs. Why wouldn't they take a new ball if it's available you ask? Well they might be getting some good reverse swing, maybe it's spinning well, maybe the batsmen are struggling with a soft ball. The game of cricket (particularly in tests) largely revolves around the state of the ball; how severely the pitch/batsmen have deteriorated it, how well the fielding team has kept one side shiney, how much moisture it has absorbed, as this all influences the variation/deviation bowlers are able to extract/batsmen have to deal with.

Free Agents are not subject to the same rules.

Because people who haven't dealt with their own personal problems, think that they can make themselves feel better by helping someone else in a similar situation.

Without having the tools to cope with their own situation, all they are doing is setting themselves up for failure because they are burying bad habits, hoping their good deeds will make it go away.  

It's like in an airplane, these are the types of people who put oxygen on everyone else first, but don't understand why they can't breathe.

JonWood007,Battlefield,1390458171.0,"I admit that BF4 has some problems, but honestly, it has nothing on the problems COD ghosts has. I can play BF4 for hours, but with COD, after 5 minutes I'm like ""why am i playing this?!"" after getting repeatedly 1 hit killed due to p2p lag and being tracked through walls by dudes with 10+ KDRs only to die the second I get within their line of sight.

Then I go play more BF4 or Crysis 3.

The big problem with BF4 is it is yet another case of nextgenitis. Almost every ""next gen"" launch title is riddled with problems, is a lot less optimized than it's supposed to be, and at least for PC players, this is justified under the guise that zomg it's NEXT GEN and therefore that's why it requires all these crazy resources to run while only looking as good as their predecessors and crap. BF4 is not the only case of this, nor is it the worst. At least BF4 is competent. The same can't be said of other games like ghosts."

When I'm asked ""What did you do on the website?"" I tell them the truth. I updated the product descriptions on the website and created promotional material, because I *did* that. A job will know when I'm lying, so there is no point in doing so, and if I get hired on for something I know nothing about they will instantly find out.

EDIT: Also, the difference is I am trained in every single thing listed. I was professionally trained for personal security, base protection, riot control, etc. There is zero misrepresentation there, especially when I have the credentials to back it up.

My father never really stopped showing his love for me, though he never saw me the same way.  I think my innocence didn't finally die in me until I saw it die in the eyes of my father.  

I think we didn't actually heal that gulf between us until about 4 or 5 years later.  I was 20, and he was going to meet some younger coworkers/drinking buddies to go bar hopping while I saw a movie, and then I'd drive him home.  We were living in a different city than the rest of my family because that's where he could find work, and he was lonely without any of us around.  So I moved there and got a job, my last before my traveling years really started.

I got out of the theater, and went to the 2nd floor of the center.  That's where the bars were, and I hoped to catch a glimpse of my father, because he didn't answer his cell phone.

As I walked around the establishments peeking through the fences and windows, I tripped over a man sitting in the shadows of a small stair case.  It was my dad.

He was so drunk he couldn't stand, and I had to carry him across a crowded Century City plaza as he threw up 12 year scotch, and calamari.  I got him to the car, and proceeded to get lost for 2 hours looking for home. I eventually got him to bed, and I truly learned that even if our heroes are flawed, and don't have all the answers, all that means is they deserve our love and admiration even more for the good they inspired in us and that it is important to  take the best parts of them and those around us, and incorporate them into ourselves to be better people.  

I also don't believe the sins of the father are the sins of the son, and because of all of his attempts to instill in me the things he had, and or wished he had in himself, that means is I let him down.  I can only hope that when my father eventually dies, he can do so knowing that those he leaves behind will try to do right by the values he wanted us to have, and that he and his lessons allow us to make it through this world in a manner that although not as financially stable as his, still allows us to face the world with our chins up, and out.

Thanks again."

MuchoMaas49,ADHD,1390458413.0,"I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 about 2 years ago and it has been really great actually. I got the diagnosis from a couple of people who should not have made it, they always put me on prozac and welbutrin. I always ended up becoming more emotionally volatile and ended up not being able to handle myself emotionally.

When I went to an actual psychiatrist, they ended up giving me this drug called Lamotrigine. Well, it's crazy but it's amazing, completely turned my emotions around, and for my entire life I never had a way to self-sooth until I started taking the drug. It's not all that common, but I recommend you talk to your psychiatrist about it as an option. At this time I only take adderall and lamotrigine, and just an FYI, it's far more likely that you're bipolar type II, so make sure you read up on it, so you know that your doctor knows what he's talking about.

GunmetalJane,AskReddit,1390458453.0,"Well, I would roll over in my bed to a dead fiance, so that would be pretty traumatizing. After calling 911, the cops, my mother, and my sister, and getting no response, I'm not sure. At some point I would need to call work to tell them I'm not coming in, so once the store, my two immediate superiors and their two immediate superiors never answered, I suppose I would leave the house, and drive somewhere to get help or figure out what was going on. There would be a progressively larger span of freaking out over this period of time. 

There are soooooo many people in the world. It would take me a while to be totally sure that everyone was dead. At first I'd assume that it was just my city, hit by some terrible sickness I was immune to. Then I'd assume the region, once I'd gone to other towns closer to me, and then once I got far enough I'd assume it was the US, hit by a final blow. 

After I finally discerned that there was no one else, at least no one I could reasonably contact (phone, internet, car -- can't fly a plane, or a boat big enough to get me anywhere)...I'm not sure. Eat whatever I wanted. Dye my hair blue and purple again, since I wouldn't have to work anymore. Do some really weird makeup, like Mad Max style fun stuff. My natural inclination to use drugs (in this scenario, definitely grow) would either crescendo into a fun adventure, or a crippling spiral ending in a lonely suicide. It would depend on how hard I took being COMPLETELY alone. 

I would also move into a library -- the best one I could find, hopefully close to useful stores like Hope Depot and Walmart. A library with lots of 'garden' space. Find a Best Buy, get a really sweet TV/game system/computer. I'd go around to people's houses and let out all the cats and dogs that are suddenly trapped inside, keeping my favorites and letting them stay with me. 

Parts of it would be awful, parts of it might turn out to be really fun. I think after 60 years, or when choking to death, totally alone, it wouldn't be fun at all. "

Then came it's sequel Def Jam: ICON. A different publisher, and some poor business decisions lead to one of the worst successors I have ever played. They removed everything that was fantastic about FFNY and replaced it with uninspired, boring fights with little, or no customization features.

madepenn,fatpeoplestories,1390458564.0,"This is a rather long-winded answer, but here goes. 

It's a small, pretty derpy park and there are no signs for weight restrictions. It's all dependent on if the rider can fit into the restraints. I encountered some fat guests who were used to working with the rides and able to fit even when smaller people had been turned away. Like, if they knew to lift their guts over the lap bars, we could accommodate some remarkably huge people. Over-the-shoulder restraints weren't so forgiving. 

I know there's gotta be a maximum weight for the machines, but I guess they don't post signs for individuals because it's dependent on the combined weight of the riders. [Evidently, I'm not the only one who thinks this is stupid and there should be signs anyway](http://fox13now.com/2012/10/30/woman-says-lagoon-should-post-weight-restrictions-for-rides/). I once got a crowd of people on [this ride](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-yR4llPJek) where every single person was quite overweight. The ride just quit mid-cycle and I had to call a maintenance guy to reset it. I know for a fact that [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGStF1C99XY) weighs everyone when it pauses at ~20 seconds into the video, displaying the total on a screen in the control tower. I've seen it get above 2000 pounds and still authorize the launch! The restraints for that ride are sketchy for the overweight as well, but I'll stop now before I bore you to death. :D"

That's why nigger, negro, even African-American went out of style, because they all had problems.  African-American was misguided because if you saw any black person from ANY country you would be talking silliness.

Intellectually disabled is so clinical sounding that it has taken the venom out of the other previous incarnations.  It refers directly to the type of ability that doesn't exist, and won't, and that's okay, as opposed to challenged which implies it should be overcome.  Who knows, maybe a new term will come along but I won't mind accommodating the people most affected by it.

The words become more specific, plain, and direct, while overcoming the baggage and misconceptions the previous words carry.  Like just ""black"" won't be a (good) insult, nor will ""trans"" instead of tranny or transvestite.

vampyrita,redditpolish,1390459182.0,"i hope you'll be mine and hear my story, because my last valentine's was *wonderful.*

my boyfriend and i both lived with our parents at the time, but his parents ceded the house to us for the night. i texted him that i was on my way over, and wore the brand new dress i had bought. i'm normally not one for dresses, but it looked great on me, and i was anxious to dress up for him. i pull up in front of his house, only to notice all the lights are turned off. ""that's...weird..."" i think to myself, but don't think much more of it.

i walk up to the door, still confused, and ring the doorbell. the door swings open, and...candles. *everywhere.* every flat surface covered, every kind of candle you could possibly imagine. tea lights all over, music playing in the background, and i'm standing there completely at a loss for words. he pulls me inside, into his arms, kisses me in the candlelight.

i put down my things and take off my shoes (strappy heels may not have been my most brilliant idea), and he takes my hand and leads me upstairs.

*fast forward an hour or two or three*

we finally snap out of our warm, love-addled haze and decide that we should probably go eat the dinner he had ready to prepare. but first...he wanted to give me his gift. my gift to him was somewhat cheesy, but his gift to me...he gave me a book of music theory, signed by the author, that has been in his family for nearly a hundred years (i'm a music major, that's not weird. it was very sweet, actually). 

he lends me a pair of sweatpants and a shirt (i was about done with wearing that dress), and we make our way downstairs towards dinner. he's bustling around the kitchen in sweatpants and no shirt, which almost made me jump him again, but we had a bit of a time limit before his parents came home. the real kicker: he made steaks. and let me just tell you how goddamn incredible they were. seasoned brilliantly, grilled to perfection (watching him grill shirtless in the moonlight helped...), and absolutely incredible. we had steak, corn, and...something else, i don't remember. my mind wasn't on the food, regardless of how incredible it was.

for dessert, he made this layered pudding. lemon pudding, diced lemon pound cake, and blueberries, layered together and served in martini glasses. that was delicious too :) we wound up going out after his parents came home. a few more rounds of fun, and some junk food, as is tradition for us. it was absolutely incredible, by far the most elaborate anyone has ever been on a date with me. i can't WAIT for valentine's this year. it'll be my first time seeing him since christmas (he's military), and it's going to be wonderful spending the weekend with him :)

okay, okay, i rambled. but i *love* to tell this story.

Fizjig,PS4,1390459330.0,"It's not exactly ""racing"" as it were. You play either a cop, or a criminal and it dictates how you play the game. Criminals race each other and elude cops for points they use to mod their cars, and get new cars. They have more customization options on how their cars look and perform. 

The cops job is to catch and wreck the criminals. They don't get the option to customize their vehicles as much, but they get cool gadgets, and weapons that help take down other vehicles. Its a trade off. You can switch between the two styles depending on how you want to play. 

It is online all the time, and racing someone, or pursuing someone is as simple as pulling up near them and hitting L1 to challenge a racer. It's a massive, open world with no restrictions, so you can join in a chase, or race at any time. You can also drop out at any time with no penalty as well.  There are plenty of ""side quest"" items like time trials and whatnot that are completely optional as well. As you play you earn points and get objectives to unlock new cars, gadgets, ect. 

Sometimes its fun to just cruise around the map free roam style and earn points for jumping obstacles and breaking speed records. 

I don't like car games much, but this one is a blast. "

Let's explain the idea of correlation does not imply causation. That means if two things correlate, it doesn't necessarily mean that one causes another. Here, you're implying that good grammar and intelligence correlate. That means that if you don't have good grammar, you're not intelligent. And that's not because intelligence causes good grammar, but rather because you're saying that good grammar and intelligence CORRELATE, i.e., they go hand-in-hand. Do you understand how, by implying that good grammar and intelligence correlate, you inadvertently implied that you're stupid?

There is a big difference between killing a fetus in the womb and a child outside the womb. Inside of the womb, the woman takes precedence because she is a complete person with the right to bodily autonomy. No one can force her to carry a fetus to term and it isn't a person with rights yet, so abortion can be chosen as a course of action. Once a fetus is born, it's considered a person with all the rights and privileges that go with that. That's why we have birth certificates and our lives are measured from our birthday and not before. Therefore it would be illegal and a crime to kill it outside the womb."

I guess what I'm getting is that just adapting it to a movie, trying to recreate the mood etc. would be all well and good but you'd lose what makes Hotline Miami a meaningful game.

It's similar to the comedian strategy of joking upwards or sideways, not downwards.  You don't kick people that are down, and if you do, you're going for that ""I'm an asshole, haha"" shtick.

huisme,learnart,1390459863.0,"[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oimk9IeRmbw) is my go-to video to show how to start a drawing, which is what I'd say you need to do. Watching videos will only teach you so much, especially if it's a ""How to draw x"" video, which will teach you bad preconceptions of how to draw things instead of how to draw from observation.

You can practice pretty much every concept of art with a flashlight, something/anything to prop it up on, pencil and paper, and a couple different object (one shiny metal, one dark-colored box, etc.). The key to learning with these supplies is observation.

Look at your subject a lot more than your paper. The subject, in reality as opposed to your imagination, is where you'll find the angles, gradations, textures, and tones you need to put on your paper. Be fast; don't take more than a second to draw a line. Fast work will force you into good habits like confident lines and gradations, trust in your observations, and fast corrections. Of course, you need to be willing to make those corrections. You're not, and I'm not, going to put everything in the right place the first time, so draw light and keep in mind that drawing is re-drawing.

There's a link at the bottom of the sidebar in the excellent posts from community members section for [basic drawing exercises \(and lesson plan\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/17dp5s/are_there_any_little_exercises_that_can_help_me/c84mb92). Give it a look; it's a good place to start, and even keep going. There's also [basic training](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnart/comments/1ch7a9/to_anyone_who_has_made_drastic_improvements/c9go6nl), focusing more on important technical skills.

Just take one step at a time. Don't try to learn everything in a month. I'm going on five years of being serious about art (I had a really slow start &gt;_&gt;), and I'm learning every time I draw. Just keep the attitude that you want to learn, and be patient with the initial sloppiness we all go through (also in the user comments section of the sidebar).

And most importantly, keep your goals in mind and have fun.

Console api has less overhead than PCs therefor they get to use closer to 100% of the actual resources, whereas direct-x+Windows limits this to 70ish percent.  This is where Mantle and Glide3d come into play.  Mantle has the capability to give PCs access to more of the hardware's capability than any console has access to.  

It's a hardware api designed for the hardware, not the software - meaning the games talk to the hardware directly (or as close as possible when code is involved)."

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1390459966.0,"Employees do get paid less when the company loses money. It's called getting laid off and it happens all the time. They get their pensions cut, their hours cut, etc. The idea that *employees* are the ones getting a free ride is ludicrous. It's the owners that get to sit back, contribute nothing, and take the surplus created by the labor of others.

Shareholders are the most mobile of all stakeholders. For this reason they often care least about its future. Shareholders rapidly enter and exit a company and thus heavily favor strategies that create short-term profit, as opposed to those that create sustained growth. 

The risk-taking argument is extremely weak. What's the risk? That they'll  become as poor as the workers? That they might have to become a Wal-Mart greeter themselves? That's the worst-case scenario; what usually happens is they end up even better off than they started. And you know what else? At least *they don't have to work*. How about the people who do the work of the company be the ones who partake in its success? Not the people who have money to play with and try to make more of it by buying shares of some company they have no attachment to. The workers are what make a company work.

InMyDreams_Nahh,gainit,1390460107.0,"I used keep much better track of these things. I'd come on /r/gainit at least a few times a day to check topics and would go in and delete any threads that violated the ""read the FAQ before posting rule.""

Unfortunately, I just don't have as much time as I used to. I still keep track of the modqueue daily (although this requires users to report posts such as these, which I strongly encourage!) and fulfill other duties, but sadly I haven't had nearly as much time to read over topics and give advice to those that need it as much as I used to. 

As for the other mods, our creator, /u/Dalatejc hasn't been particularly active since I joined /r/gainit almost two years ago. /u/Troycar is a fantastic mod, but it appears he hasn't been on reddit in 4-6 months if you go off his commenting activity. The only other mod who remains consistently active is /u/denaturedprotein, but I can't speak to his personal time commitment. 

Essentially, two of our mods are absent, and the two that aren't don't have enough time to run the sub by themselves. My personal suggestion would at least to add new moderators. I'd like to see two or three people who *do* have the time to commit and care for the subreddit be added to help keep /r/gainit clean and help it grow. I'll have to confer with /u/denaturedprotein so that I'm not acting alone, but I doubt he'll oppose the suggestion. 

I'd also like to thank /u/CaptainWigwam and the rest of the users for giving feedback. If you remain silent about problems that exist within the subreddit, change can't happen. I've certainly been a bit lax in the last few months on my end of running the subreddit, and for that, I apologize. I'll commit more time back to /r/gainit because it's a community I love and I miss helping our great users. 

One last note. Don't be afraid to contact the moderators with complaints -- even about us -- through modmail. I can see if I've received new modmail just as you would see if you received a response to a post/comment, so I will know if you are trying to contact the mods the moment I begin to browse reddit. I strongly encourage all users to take advantage of this feature if you have any criticism, feedback, suggestions, etc. for the moderators.

Thanks for caring about the community everybody. With a little effort, we'll get the subreddit back to it's glory days. Keep an eye out in the coming day or so for a post calling for new mods. Once new mods have been chosen, we will make a post asking for community ideas on new rules/changes/etc. to /r/gainit. Both posts will be stickied for at least a day or two, so keep an eye out!"

77P,discgolf,1390460128.0,"I'll try and help you out with some basics.   
 1. Yes, don't want to risk anything. It's better to be safe then sorry. Same rule applies to other non-discgolfers walking through the park. Wait for them to get out of the way.  
 2. Yeah that's totally alright. Especially if you're just a rec player, just be considerate.  
 3. Usually for blind holes, or if they aren't paying attention. Makes a huge difference on busy courses.   
 Other Tips  
 -Don't litter  
 -Don't Deface the baskets. Even if you got an ace. Write it on your 20$ disc not the $400 basket please.  
 -Same goes for drawing on anything. Disc Chargers are funny the 1st time. Not so much the 2nd, or 3rd Ect.  
 -Please let faster groups play through. You can reverse this too. If a group is playing slow ask if you can throw with them on this hole. Then they will let you pass them on the next hole. If i'm out by myself sometimes i'll just till until another solo guy comes and I can ask if he wants to throw with me.   
 -Don't yell while other people are throwing  
 -Instead of talking while they throw try and watch where their disc lands. 
 - And most of all, just be considerate. If you have to question what you're about to do. Just think if it will affect anyone besides you.  
EX:  
 - Smoking Cigs, Probably not. Taking Acid, Probably.  
 -Write ace on my disc? Good. Basket? Probably not.  
 And just make sure to have fun!!!

It would not have been the end of the world to postpone the wedding while she went to San Francisco and they did things long distance, like when she studied abroad in France. Marshall was an asshole for giving her that ultimatum. Art is her dream, and he couldn't support it for six fucking months? It wouldn't have changed the end result, they still would have gotten married, and it would've saved them both a lot of pain and would have prevented a lot of turmoil within the group.

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1390461483.0,"&gt;Has Richard Sherman ever at any other moment other than this (allegedly) displayed sportsmanship to other players? Fans?

This shows how ignorant most people are of Sherman outside of Seattle. He routinely shows respect to other players. Think about how often you hear of a ""fiasco"" regarding Sherman. Maybe 2-4 media garnering ""incidents"". Most of the time he's joking with other receivers, making nice with them, having tongue and cheek conversations and shakes hands after the game. But those moments don't break national news. If someone spites him, he's not going to miss his opportunity to get them back--sure. But the default Sherman is a wholesome, good guy. "

Also, block the guys who harass you. There's no reason to read his vitriol - he *wants* you to quit, and while that shouldn't prevent you from doing so if that's just what you need to do to preserve your quality of life, you should be aware that's what he's aiming for and that you have other options available. You can also avoid the All COMM tab, if need be.

Furthermore, let Niantic know about what's going on. I'm not sure how or if they'll take any kind of action on it, but it's still a good idea.

And finally, if you keep playing, then encourage any newbies, especially RES newbies, in any way that you can to help counteract the shit coming from their side.

It was broad daylight, he was caught, he was never going to get away with the crime. I know in the US the media loves to shit on the police, I know reddit especially loves it but they aren't all bad. For every bad police man there is 20 good individuals who had a similar upbringing as ourselves. A criminal record will just make things awkward and if your as young as this guy then its just going to get in the way of you trying to get back on top of life, the idea is to reform.

If anything he would of gotten 50 or so days of public service and some sort of rehab program as a punishment, that's if any of this was even worth bringing to a court. Honestly, the guy in OP's video isnt worth the time.

&gt;In terms of the issue at hand, we feel so strongly about this because people act like we literally don't even exist anymore. People wear redface in public and companies illegally sell things under the moniker of specific tribes, even if the tribes have their own names trademarked.

&gt;Beyond that it's a simple thought process about colonization. It's simply extra offensive for a group of people to roll up into your homeland, break hundreds of legal agreements with you, take everything you own, marginalize your people, take your children for generations, and then decide it's super cute and fun to dress up like you because you used to be so noble and close to nature. There was a genocide here. I hate to do this, but **imagine if the Nazis won in Europe and in 2050 it became really cute to wear yamakas with your sundresses, sing Have Nagila at parties, and use menorahs as your candlesticks at dinner.** That is revolting, right?

](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1vvmnz/student_is_a_little_bit_disappointed_that_his/cewlpur)
&gt;I remember being told of something the great 20th century pianist, Beveridge Webster would do during lessons: he'd work on crossword puzzles while a student played for him. Of course, this is a reversal of the situation, like a prof using the cell phone while charting out some diagram on the blackboard. But Webster would get up and point out all these things while ""distracted"". To me the point is the quality of the engagement, not whether one slavishly observes a rule of decorum. No doubt some may be truly distracted, flippant, inconsiderate and disrespectful of the learning process. Others may not. I guess in a way I like the idea of someone using a cell in class for some legitimate reason, or as a way of distracting themselves. Do note that there have bee some studies that show that doodling or something like that actually may increase comprehension and learing. Why? Because as the mind wanders, more of it is included in the process. Moving into different territories means that the mind re-approaches the same presented material from different angles, from different frames of references, integrating the material more ""across personality"" rather than someone who is comported in a staid (ready: ""stayed"" or ""arrested""), rigid pose of reception and oh-so-effortful attention. Like the musician who tries so hard, is fiercely trying so hard, yet for all of that, is much less receptive to new ideas, often really the most unable to learn, paradoxically. Interesting to note that in her movie of her mother, Stephanie Argerich's film ""Bloody Daughter"" shows her mother, the great pianist Martha Argerich to be someone who rather purposefully tries not to be too planned, in order to keep her fresh, intuitive style. These are examples of musicians, I realize, but the same may be true for other areas of expertise. One might say that there may be some value in this more ""flittig around"" approach, a more fluid and dynamic way of listening, not listening, and re-alighting on presented material from different standpoints, but that at least there must be certain things underway, to distinguish this from someone who just isn't there for the material in the first place and is only trying to text a message about the next frat party. Perhaps that is true. But whether the way to get that frat dude interested and really up to a decent standard of learning is going to be best accomplished by restricting phone usage remains up in the air for me. Probably depends on how one catches it.

&gt;The poster about this was all in a tiff about his (really had to be a guy right?) rights, while I'm going on about something a bit different, missing the point and interjecting my own agenda about something like ""dynamic, multi-leveled learning"", which presumably is a far cry from his one-tracked mind. But, then again, perhaps the poster is really protesting not so much against the restriction of the use of the phone, but what he takes to be what is really being required of him: that very staid, rigid posture of ""learning"", that of subordination of self into a rather mechanical aping of mature learning that he may well find unpleasant and demanding for good reasons. It is as if he wants to bring himself along to the process, phone and all, rather than leaving himself behind and entering some dreary process of learning that he's already grown to suspect after too many years of it. Maybe the answer is: by all means, keep your cell, and you can msg or check your mail at times, but please, just give me a good question, care about the material, interact with it, wake up, be alive in your learing, dance with it, find it truly interesting, vital, important!

Eat more lean chicken, more green vegetables, and try to cut out as much bread, pasta, cheese, and sugar as possible. That should take you to three 500cal meals per day.

If you get kind of peckish between meals, toss in a 60cal light yogurt.

s-mores,dontstarve,1390462657.0,"Caves are the best thing ever. Though I disagree with your premises. I'd recommend something more like:

* Light is all-important. Have a miner's hat, find some lightbulbs ASAP and come back up to prototype a lantern.
* **You are not there to fight things by yourself!** Once you realize you're just supposed to hire some bunnies or rockies and IGNORE everything except running around, dodging, you're in a much better condition. Repeat, do NOT take on anyone solo, with the exception of bats.
* Remember to destroy spilagmites after taking out the inhabitants by bunnies/rockies.
* You have two choices: Lantern + Football helmet and Pick/Weapon + Miner's hat. Use the first one most of the time, change to the Tam if your sanity drops below 60%. Fuel them with lightbulbs, not fireflies. Lightbulbs are plentiful and regrow in a day or two, you only 6 for a full day's spelunking, that would be 3 fireflies -- and fireflies don't grow on trees!
* Your li'l buddy Chester will SAVE YOUR LIFE. Bunnies will kill you if you're carrying meat, but if the meat is in Chester, no problemo! So some +health items and a bunch of jerky in Chester and you can basically remain in the caves forever.
* Farms actually work in the first level. Drop a bunch of farms and an icebox with 10 carrot seeds on a bunny village, instant rabbit friend whenever you want one.
* Sanity is an issue, yes. Though with jerky, the Tam and rabbits *(since they give a huge sanity boost)* it's mitigated to a non-issue."

IDK man they seem to be interacting amicably and if not respectfully to me man. But maybe you read body language differently than me. Because that's the norm with sherman. He's not afraid to get into it with other players, and when he does, he goes full force, but even that in of itself is not a bad thing.

That's what you're failing to understand. And yes, I do believe he meant good game to Crabtree when he said it.

mrpoopistan,AskReddit,1390462941.0,"Funny enough, I'm an American whose greatest culture shock was in America. And it's food-related and it's dumb.

I grew up in the Appalachian part of Pennsylvania in a town that was heavily settled by Poles and Italians. It's very insular and a lot of old traditions still persist. I grew up around seventh generation people who still speak fluent Italian.

The first time I left the region in my early 20s, I was astonished to find that grocery stores don't have two entire aisles and a full freezer case of pasta. 

I can remember taking a trip to Michigan and talking to friend of a friend about one of the various subsets of pasta -- some capafussitortellini, I forget which exact one -- and find out that they had never tried it. So I was like, ""shit I'll just go to the store and buy some and make it for ya!""

I'm in a Kroger's and there's like this tiny single shelf with all of the pasta on it, and like two bags of frozen raviolli in the freezer section! WTF?!

To this day, everywhere I go in the world, I look to see how much pasta they have in the grocery stores. And don't get me started on the lack of pierogies, halushki, etc.

It's dumb, and I've since traveled multiple continents, but the pasta thing is always the one that leaves me worried about the rest of humanity."
