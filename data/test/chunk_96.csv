beanfiddler,lewronggeneration,1391115031.0,"Absolutely. A lot of the bands and artists I listen to are really heavily studio polished or still fairly garage-y, so not very great live. So I miss the big arena shows. I won't pass up a chance to see someone like Gaga, Beyonce, or Muse in person purely because of the spectacle. I'm liking a lot of the ""nu-disco"" stuff coming out of Australia because of all the makeup and glitter and spectacle. A lot of them don't tour to my city though.

Also, the more glittery and over-the-top the show, the more likely I'm able to get all my friends to go with me. "

raptor6c,AskMen,1391115092.0,"Don't worry over much about this, 'creepy' is subjective.  When people say something is 'creepy' it just means they think a sufficient/significant number of people would agree that the thing would make them feel 'creeped out'.  This is a very nebulous assumption as it assumes knowledge of what the number of people who would be creeped out by the thing actually is and that that number is high enough that everyone should act as if it's universally true.  The reality is something could be considered creepy by 51% of people as easily as 99% of people and there would still be a 'consensus' that the activity should be considered creepy and engaged in or not accordingly.  Few people bother considering what the actual number is and accounting for that in their analysis of how appropriate their behavior might be.

People tend to innately prefer being in consensus with their group, hence you are concerned about the fact that you and your girlfriends aren't in consensus and so your actions, based on your own feelings, might be wrong.  This is understandable but you should really ask yourself would you follow your feelings and accept that you'll only get positive feedback from people who are positive towards who you feel you should be and possibly neutral or negative feedback from those who don't feel that way or behave in a way that is in accordance with whatever the consensus opinion of society is and only interact with people the way the consensus says you should regardless of whether that's the way you, or they, prefer to interact?"

2)sales sales sales. At any moment of any day, I can find you good games that are on sale for at least 50% off (commonly more). Steam has sales every day, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.

3)You are correct about upgrades, but it's not bad at all. It's spending like 150 bucks every 5 years or so, and then you're beating consoles into the ground, especialyl if you're upgrading in the middle of a console generation.

4)No added costs for internet. No Xbox live, or PSN fees. Just pay for your internet, and you're good to go.

yudayajin,Warhammer,1391115117.0,"Well, I recently finished a four month journey to complete a Death Korps force and I would be happy to give you some tips from my own limited experience. 

Not sure what your level of patience, dedication, and anal retentiveness is, but I really like trying to do things as meticulously as possible. The first thing I did was look around the web for assembly guides and created a list of the tools I saw frequently used, before I touched anything I went on Amazon and bought everything so I wouldn't feel any pressure to half-ass something when I didn't have the right tool. My suggested list with some explanations follows, though not all of it will be needed for just infantry. 

Best of luck keep us updated!

Suggested Supplies:
A good pair of clippers that cut flush. (the sharper the better, dull clippers will sometimes force the resin to bend or deform when you are taking flimsy bits off of the sprues).

A good sharp craft knife/razor blade in a pen grip. (For cleaning up the mold lines. You want to try to avoid using files to remove mold lines, they will create flat areas and rough textures if you are not insanely careful/patient/a surgeon).

A good fine-toothed razor saw. (great for getting smooth cut for conversions, I only used it on vehicles and a few minor conversions).

A rubber coated vise. (A gentle vise that won't damage the model will make a lot of the prep work easier without the awkwardness of holding the model in your hand while you hack away like a butcher). 

A sculpting tool (you can buy small sets our just get a single one. This is going to make using green stuff much easier). 

A pin vice. (Used to hold teeny tiny drill bits that will let you pin things for extra strength). 

A fine file. (not for mold lines if you can use a razor, but is very useful to smooth out other irregularities. If possible get a set of flat, round, half-round, and triangle).

Fine grit sand paper. (I used it on tanks, but occasionally used it on helmets that were not perfectly smoothed).

Tweezers. (it will make precision placement of the excellent tiny components soooo much easier).

Flat nosed pliers (super useful for bending wire and etched brass).

florist wire (comes in a variety of sizes, I used it for my tanks and comm whips, a lot of fun to use, not at all necessary).

Plasticard (if you are going to scratchbuild anything, you need plasticard).

Hairdryer (it helps you speed up drying paint and can be used to bend resin. Be really careful to only slightly heat up the resin since it will melt. I recommend practicing on left over resin sprues to get a hang of it. I melted a power sword and felt like throwing skaven slaves around my living room). 

Superglue and activator (I like Gale Force 9 superglue and their rapid cure, if you haven't used an activator before it will change your life).

PVA glue (for basing).

Model Filler (not green stuff! model filler will fill gaps and then dry solid so that you can sand it after. Green stuff will not sand/file smoothly).

Green Stuff (for the minor sculpting projects that will inevitably crop up).

Painting Supplies:

Brushes (you can get really carried away here. I went with a set of nice sable hair brushes that I ruined immediately by not taking care to clean them properly. I then went out and bought the next level set and learned to clean my brushes. It was a very expensive lesson to learn).

Paint (I just sucked it up and bought the complete Vallejo paint line. It was probably a mistake. I spent close to a grand and only used maybe 70-100 colors. If you are a good planner you can just buy the paint you want to use, but I like to have options for when I get inspiration on my porcelain throne).

Inks (I like Vallejo, but there is a ton of good inks out there from what I learned. remember to thin your inks with water at the very least. I tried using water and varnish which a lot of much better painters than I recommended, but I couldn't get the hang of it. Remember that inks dry gloss).

Washes (they dry matt unlike inks and generally do not require much/any thinning).

Primer (I hand primed my models, because I hate myself and want to suffer. There is lots of spray primer out there).

Buelldozer,MLS,1391115194.0,"It's _also_ a false dichotomy that can't teach tactics and adjust them.

Strategically if you start your game with a 4-4-2 and midway decide that you need more pressure and would like to shift to a 3-4-3 the players should be able to accommodate that. If they cannot then they are not being properly instructed.

Tactically if your players cannot, or are not allowed, to do anything but triangle pass their way down the field they're not being instructed in tactics. At that point the only thing they're being ""taught"" is blind adherence to a system. They're being trained to be robots. THIS is my problem with much of the academy coaching I've seen so far and that kind of ""player development"" isn't going to save anything but perhaps a Coach's job.

At the lower levels of youth play I've seen plenty of issues with teams not having a strategy or the tactical instruction to execute but we're not talking about Silver level, or even necessarily Gold level, players here. I'm talking about Elite level players and teams, Academy teams.

The bulk of our next generation of National and International players are going to come from these Teams and from what I've seen they're not being encouraged to display creativity both tactically and strategically."

theskipster,relationships,1391115343.0,"When I was your age me and my girlfriend of 2.5 years broke up.  I didn't realize until months later how complacent on improving myself being in a good relationship made me.  I went from a straight A student in college to a college drop out.  I lost my full ride scholarship that I didn't even apply for.

Once I became single it was like a light switched on and I started using my freedom to better myself.  Not because I felt I had to but because I then wanted to and I could. I taught myself a skill I could get a good job with.  I started learning about other subjects again.  

I got good enough at what I did that I was hired to teach people who do what I do.  I've had two colleges offer me a position to teach their college courses (but the accreditation board doesn't like college dropouts teaching college courses).  15 or so years later of constantly having a good job, I'm currently in a fascinating and kick ass job for a kick ass company.  Most days I look forward to go to work.

And if we hadn't of broken up when I was 21, I'd very likely still be working retail or managing a burger joint right now.  I also noticed that when I got together with my wife, my drive started to dwindle again.  I have to kind of force my self to continue to work hard.

It has nothing to do with you. He has a way to vent and unwind that he likes. There's nothing wrong with that.

If it does bother you, it probably wouldn't hurt to mention to him that you feel a little neglected that he never comes to you when he's upset. (maybe not that word but something similar). Communication is always a good idea, just remember it's not you. :)"

Eh, typical demographic would be mothers and such yeah? Seems a lot of the folks here are parents or single parents. As for myself, I'm just a 21 year old fella with a lot to say and not much to say at the same time. Ha ha. 

Struggles, eh? I get that. Been there, many times. Past few years have been almost nothing but struggles for me. I just tend to keep it to myself, since talking about all of it just sounds like a load of unbelievable, outlandish bullshit. Last thing I want to sound like is a whiny ass dude, honestly. Nobody cares, and its a waste of my time to talk about over and over with prospective friends. My patience for it all is long since burned out.

On one hand it doesn't matter- its all in the past. On the other...Heh. Its still stuff I'm dealing with the repercussions of. Normalcy is only barely existent as of the past year, and even that has been hard to maintain as is.

As for friends, I'm lucky to have the few people that consider me a friend. I think I've become a complacent, detached person if I'm being realistic here. My attachment to anyone is about as firm as their involvement in my life, and seeing as all my friends are distant no matter what I do doesn't really matter, ultimately. 

I consider myself a river. Filled with jagged rocks, chilly, and rushing along a set path that never really has a point. Thats the best metaphor I can say for myself.

heh. Well, as for pissing people off I really cannot give a fuck about that. :D I'm more likely to get pissed off at people. Like a week or two ago I saw a contest that was very obviously geared towards selective choosing, and looked pretty circlejerky in general. I commented about it, because it was annoying to see. 

People that think like I think, eh? No wonder I don't mesh with the other kids. Other people tend to get on my nerves more often than not.  Like Carlin said, my tolerance for stupid bullshit is very low. 


Which makes it all the more strange that I want to connect with others and be friendly. I'm kind of an ^^^^oxy moron, I'd say.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1391115558.0,"&gt;No. You still don't realize what people want. Being rich means shit if you don't have rights. People want rights and beauty has never given anyone any rights. 

Anyone with even a passing knowledge of history can tell you that people do not want rights as a natural desire, or something worth upsetting the balance of a society for. Rights dont even exist...they're made up codes of ethics the weak make up to protect themselves from the strong. In Ancient Rome, no one was even considered a citizen until they served 25years in the military, and Roman society did not treat women particularly poorly. In fact, even female slaves where 5x more expensive than male slaves and treating them badly was an extreme disrespect for a massive investment of money. 

People don't want rights, they want a lack of a disproportionate preferential treatment to those not believed to be of merit. 

Furthermore, the premise of the argument was not that beauty gives people rights, it was that beauty gives women a high degree of preferential treatment, which not the same thing. 

Your argument is both incorrect, and a non-sequitor. 

&gt;Anyway, your response makes if perfectly clear to me that you are delusional about feminism, biology and social factors. I've met your kind before and I see no point in having this discussion with you.

Your responses make it perfectly clear you are delusional about feminism,
biology, and social factors. You drink the koolaid because you're a woman and you dont want to disbelieve that a social theory that tells you ""women are the best.

Serae,AskWomen,1391115598.0,"Yes, once.

I was in high school and generally having a tough time in my private life so I attribute my reaction to bottled up stress.

I had a friend who was dating a really jealous girl.  This friend and I sat with each other at lunch and in our art class.  Sometimes we hung out and played video games.  it was very chill and he was really head over heels for his girl.

Apparently he mentioned me a few too many times to her.  She got it into her head that I was after ""her man"" and tried to start a fight with me.  I was not interested in her boyfriend, I was in love with a guy who was no good for me.

I was walking down the hall only to get pushed, hard, from behind.  I turned to look at her and she got in my face, called me a number of names and accused me of trying to steal her boyfriend and to back off.

I frowned and simply told her we were just friends and that I wasn't interested in him.   I had my own boyfriend.  Apparently she thought I was lying and knocked my books out of my hands and down a flight of stairs spraying papers everywhere.  This was going to be a HUGE mess and I will likely never get all the item back because teenagers are assholes and everyone else in the hall started kicking the items around and taking things.

I pretty much flipped my lid.  I can't quite recall what happened except for the end result: I had her by her hair and the back of her shirt and was slamming her, repeatedly, into a locker.  The skin on her face was peeled by getting thrown into the grating on the locker.  I lost a handful of hair in the process but didn't feel it at the time (I did later though!).

I was in luck, this happened right next to the school library.  I was pretty close with the librarian since I was his library assistant for two study hall periods a day and after classes.  I was a ""nice, calm, honors student,"" and had a positive reputation.  He broke it up and had the girl sent to the nurses office.  He whirled me into the library and had a quick chat with me about what happened.  I just balled my eyes out and explained what happened and how I think I just popped because reasons.

The librarian looked at me and then sighed.  I'll never forget what he said, ""We have to go to the Principal's office and you are going to agree to everything I say.""  He covered for me completely.  He said he saw it happen and immediately broke it up.  She started it and started wailing on me.  I covered my head and knocked her away.  She ended up getting knocked hard into a locker and hurting her face.  He claimed I minimally defended myself and that her injuries were an accident.  She was entirely to blame.

The girl in question was in trouble a lot so it wasn't a hard story to buy.  She was suspended for quite some time. I had a week of in school suspension which was spent, at the librarian's request, doing some extra work with him.

We watched history documentaries and played backgammon most of the week.  Or I did my homework, took some naps of surfed the web.  The general school community knew the truth.  5'1"" geek pummeled the every living crap out of a much bigger girl and absolutely got away with it.

I never had a run in with anyone at my high school again.  I wasn't anyone's doormat either.  I was just left alone and that was cool with me.

But this article talks about factors behind the scenes that caused this, what I don't get is what actually happened to stall all the roads? I drive a shitty camry, never get snow tires, my tires are almost bald, and I drive year round. Now driving in the snow is hard and dangerous, that's why I drive 20 mph on the highway tops, I drive 5 mph on any non interstate and if I know an intersection light or stop sign is up ahead I start testing my breaks hundreds of yards away, sometimes even stopping completely just to make sure I can.

I can't imagine how emulating God's cessation of creative work can possibly help me get close to God.

&gt;Or not eating certain foods.

It just baffles me how always knowing that my diet is dictating by God helps me see God everywhere. I just don't. I eat my kosher food, and I absolutely never think about God while doing so. Especially when you look at Deut 8:10

2) If there are lockers, don't spread your stuff out in front of multiple lockers when getting ready.

3) If the locker room is full and you're with a friend, get dressed and have the conversation outside instead of taking up space.

TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1391115809.0,"&gt;What can we, as women, do at these crucial turning points of relationships to bridge the gap?

By here it's too late. You think that he's emotionally closed off? Well guess what, he can talk to his 'bros' about the problem. You know what that means? There's something about your relationship that makes him feel like he can't share certain aspects of his life with you. Maybe you don't listen when he's trying to say something that's important to him, maybe you come off as busy or too into your own troubles that he doesn't want to bother you, maybe you reacted poorly during your first year and he's held shit in ever since. Whatever it is, it doesn't matter because by this point, it's too late. What you can do with the next guy (or if this one somehow gets back with you) is make him feel like he's always welcomed to share and talk. You let him open up to you. Ask meaningful, pertinent, and not overly probing questions, and try to support him emotionally.

I may have ranted a little, I used to date someone that I couldn't talk to, but I could always talk to my friends.

I totally agree that relationships take work to maintain and that love can be really developed and strengthened over time. Maybe it's just that I'm older now, but I'm way more interested in stories of how people stayed together and made it work than of people just meeting. Meeting people isn't really the hard part of love.

That being said being 'lovestruck' really is a thing that happens. I don't know whether it's happened to you or not, but I've certainly had that feeling. There have been people I've met where I've felt like I was struck by a bolt of lighting - and these are people that I just *knew* I had to be with. And whenever I dated these people there were good times, and bad times, and it took work to keep the relationship going, but those relationships *were* different. I've certainly developed love for a partner over time, but they never reached the same peaks as the ones where I was love struck and it developed from there.

That's not the same thing as attraction or infatuation. It really is something different. There are just certain people out there that are (for lack of a better word) special for whatever reason."

In order to get all the different proteins you would get from meat, you would have to eat several vegetables and nuts.
  
All you need is a piece of meat the size of a deck of playing cards. You don't need to substitute anything else, just promote sensible portions."

You're wishing for an ideal world.

&gt;Your argument for why it is ""questionable"" though is that people still need to produce to consume, a fact of reality itself, and have been blinded by the fallacious doctrines of the state that it is this cornucopia of wealth that does not need to deal with scarcity and only robs and coerces you ""for your own good"". You are a child while it is the parent, and it knows what's better for you than you do.

Lemme ask you this. As we begin to automate jobs, are you gonna be for redistributing wealth? Or are you going to let people starve? At some point, as our society is going to become more futuristic and we rely on machine labor more and more, you're gonna have to make that choice. I see your goals as incompatible with the 21st century.

Until then, we can, at the very least, give people who are on the short end of the power relationship a better deal than they would otherwise via regulations and safety nets.

Drop_,DotA2,1391116005.0,"I don't know if the point still stands though.

If it's 60% of your current mana, that means you will essentially always have mana to cast it, and it has a lower cooldown than regular fireblast.  

Even if you never used your Q again after you pick up Agh's, you're still increasing your throughput by over 100%.

Without Aghs in a teamfight you can maybe get off 1 or 2 fireblasts if it goes for a long time and you don't die.  Here the limiting factor is the 12 second cooldown for fireblast.

With old Aghs you could get off maybe 3, depending on your total mana pool due to the high static cost of unrefined fireblast before (400 mana). 

With new Agh's the limiting factor is time again, rather than mana, and you can probably get off 2-5 casts depending on your mana pool and duration of the fight.  It gives him more CC, and more damage, and removes mana as a limiting factor in terms of how long he can contribute to a fight.

what_a_cat_astrophe,IAmA,1391116074.0,"It is, in a way.  I think they're more kind of like side projects.  A few artist do this when they get together with a vocalist.  Some examples:

* Andain: Gabriel &amp; Dresden with Mavie Marcos

* Motorcycle: Gabriel &amp; Dresden with JES

* Late Night Alumni: Kaskade with Becky Jean Williams (primarily speaking.. There are Finn Bjarnson and John Hancock as well now)

And there are a few others I can't think of right now.  A lot of times they get together for an album or two and are done.  Most of them don't really tour as a band, except Late Night Alumni has really taken off recently."

He was merely evaluating his current talent. Manning throws wobbly passes. He also is accurate and makes smart decisions. Those two things are something a Dback would have to look for. 

What you don't understand is that he wasn't attempting to praise him or criticize him but evaluate. He did not attempt to compliment him. It wasn't about complimenting him... It was about identifying what he sees in his game. And what he sees in his game is a lot of good things, but one negative that he could attempt to exploit. "

I made most of my in-game money doing incursions, which are high level PvP instances that you do with fleets of about 30-40 people. Good guys, bullshitted on their comms, got a feel for fleet combat. Made enough bank doing that as I was training up skills more relevant in PvP that eventually I felt like making the jump to null sec to experience other parts of the game. Got my feet wet doing PvP but even then, it's not like there's *constant* action every day. In my downtime? Did I have to mine to make isk? Nope. I set up colonies on planets to produce good and materials to ensure I had a steady cash flow. 

I was never part of one of these gigantic blocs but I still had a blast playing. Everyone has a story. Some big and some small. The thing is, it starts as soon as you play.

&gt;After his Hajj, Malcolm X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to ""rearrange"" his thinking about race and ""toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions"".[231] In a 1965 conversation with Gordon Parks, two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

&gt;[L]istening to leaders like Nasser, Ben Bella, and Nkrumah awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.

&gt;Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant—​the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get together—​and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then—​like all [Black] Muslims—​I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.

I'm with /u/alessandralily on the pictures... really it's not that they could use improvement, it's that they do you no justice at all.. it's awesome that you'll look so much better in person, but these pictures could be a whole lot better and this would still be true.

You enjoy photography and DSLR video on the side.. there's no excuse for these pictures.

**Self-Summary**

I don't watch park and rec.. I know who Ron is, I have no idea who Ben Wyatt is so you've lost me with your very first sentence.

The next paragraph.. needs reworking.. I get the gist of what you're trying to say, but I'd just lose the first part and leave the second which says the same thing so much more clearly.. maybe expand from there.

I may be missing something but the quote is not tying into what you've said about your personality.. 

I kind of prefer *""Shared pain is lessened; shared joy, increased — thus do we refute entropy.""*, ""Callahan's Law"", as expressed in The Callahan Chronicles by Spider Robinson

It doesn't connect any better, but it sure beats crying alone.

**doing with your life**

Good.. Unlike /u/alessandralily I *like* interest links.. it helps OKc gather statistics and I think that's a good thing.   Off site links not so much but I only spotted one of those near the end.  

Overall, I like it.. I'm not sure where leisure activities fit in here.. i'd move photography and the following paragraph up to your self summary.

**good at**

Pretty solid list.  it's not bad.. but it's also not really date attracting?   how about tying back to photography here instead and point people to your second photo album?

**first things**

Needs some work.. the bit about speaking with your own voice should be up in your summary, that's something that a person is going to learn as they get to know you.   

Beard works.. I would ask the next 4 random people you run into (cashiers, bartenders, coworkers) and see what they think the answer should be.

**Favorites** 

Good list, but lengthy list.. and you really need to apply those graphic design skills to make it more readable.

**six**

Not terrible, not eye catching, not a lot to use as a hook to start a conversation with you.

**thinking about**

Not bad.. cerebral, but that really seems to be you.

**Friday**

Social activities.. something a potential date can mentally picture herself doing with you.  good.

**private**

A common private thing, but very well worded.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1391116396.0,"&gt; I'm not sure if she's afraid to lose me at all, which hurts.

Well, it might not be that she isn't afraid to lose you, but that she thinks you won't leave her no matter what she does. That's worse to me though. She thinks that she can get away with whatever because she won't have to face the consequence of you leaving (versus the consequence of how it makes you feel).

&gt; Strangely, she does have days where she seems genuinely apologetic. She will randomly come to me and express her deepest apology and tell me she's committed to ensuring she never hurts me in that way again. Then when I show signs of insecurity she will say she resents the fact I don't trust her.

That's because being apologitic when you're in a good mood is easy. Let me guess, she apologizes and then you tell her it's okay, don't worry, ect. She apologizes not because she gives a shit, but because she likes the reassurance and comfort you give her. Plus it makes her look good. 

When you're angry and upset though that actually requires her to own up to what she's done and be the bad guy. You aren't comforting her then or telling her that it's okay. Instead, you're telling her things she doesn't want to hear and so she tries to deflect that. It's easy to say, ""I'm the bad guy!"" when you know the response you're going to get is, ""No you're not!""

&gt; I have committed to trying to make this work,

 You can try, but it's never going to work until she realizes that the relationship isn't just about her and what makes her happy. It's good you have a back up plan, because with her attitude you're going to need it. Infidelity in a relationship can be worked through, but only if the cheater can actually handle the consequence of their actions and accept what they've done wrong. Your wife can't and won't. Her attitude about what happened is what's destroying your relationship. If she could grow up and act as selfless as she did selfish during the affair it could potentially work. However, she's made it clear that she's tired of helping you out when you're down, even though she caused this mess. 

It's funny too because her whole deflecting attitude when you're upset probably only makes things so much worse and causes you to get upset more often. 

&gt; And hey, if she ends up being faithful and my trust returns

I don't think it's about the infidelity or trust anymore though. Really the problem is her selfishness. She would much rather you feel like shit because of something she caused than actually handle the burden herself. You know why she doesn't want you to be upset? Because it's work for her to deal with it. If she genuinely cared for you she would feel *crushed* every time you mentioned the hurt that she caused. She wouldn't try to blame you for it or tell you to get over it, she would understand what she's done. She doesn't though, and being the victim in this is more important to her than how you're feeling about this situation."

Go to orthographic mode to be able to zoom in enough by hitting 5 on the numberpad, then choose vertex select mode (in edit mode), press c and paint around until you select all the vertices surrounding the tip (I'm not sure what's happened, but it's pretty messed up there) and select ""merge - at centre"".  Now select everything with a and clear seams - your seams are pretty strange.  Now using loop select in edge select mode (loop select is holding alt while selecting), select a ring around the tip and the centre line on the bottom, then mark seams.  Now unwrap, and you get something reasonable - you could either fit a texture to it or fit it to a texture, but it looks vaguely OK just as it stands.

Many suicidal people 'fail' to kill themselves in other ways, due to poor planning, or the drive to do it fades before they can prepare.  Guns usually eliminate those variables.  Most suicide survivors often regret the attempts.

If there is a gun in your household, it will most likely be used against someone living in it.  That is the most important discussion we can have when talking about guns, and whether or not owning one is worth the risk having such a powerful tool at one's disposal.

Team based warfare is much more then simply orbiting, in fact depending on if your logistics (healers, not space trucking) or dps dealing, your specific battle experience will be different. If your enemy is drone based while your sniper fit, you might need to kite which means warping between celestial or structures so you keep them at range. Or if your fleet is close range fit, using a interceptor in your fleet as a warp in on the enemy fleet to close the distance.

At it's core though, combat *does* consist basically orbiting around an anchor while you apply damage to primary targets and moving through the list. The tension and fun comes from trying to pick the correct targets, breaking through a tank, and routing the enemy fleet. "

As for the download the best thing to do is power down your xbox by holding the power sensor on the front of the console for 15 seconds thus rebooting the system. then retry installing the update.

FrankieSucks,Wicca,1391116706.0,"Well a tarot reading is a particular service that you use a skill to perform.   Teaching about spirituality overall may teach students to learn the tarot on their own, but wont be performing the service for them.

I don't blame people for wanting to make a living, but accepting money for teaching is a slippery slope.  From several of the books I have read on the subject, **not** accepting money for teaching is a fundamental aspect of Wicca.  However, as we can see here, that is a bit controversial.  

At what point does it all stop?  I think we can agree that $10 for an hour long workshop isn't a big deal, but how is that different from charging $100 for a reiki attunement, and requiring three seperate sessions to become fully attuned? (Not hating on reiki, just the first example that popped into my head).

Ideally, people should teach Wicca for the love of passing their knowledge on others.  Teaching for profit or for an ego-stroking don't seem to be in the spirit of Wicca.

But I do see where you are coming from. It is important to appreciate the teachings of others.  In a large workshop, where you will never see the person again, it might be good to pay for something like that, just like you would pay for a book."

Now if there were no names, then my #5 jumper would just transition over and I wouldn't have to buy another one. The whole retro side of things is massive too, the AFL even mentioned that. They know they can sell a shitload of ""#5 Ablett"" or ""#18 Carey"" guernseys.

slapdashbr,Economics,1391116771.0,"Define ""better""

You can use economics as a science to make quantitative models, the goal of which being to accurately predict what will happen with the economy. Like meteorologists try to accurately predict the weather. You can even try to predict what will happen if you make certain changes. But economics does not tell us what outcome is the most desireable- that is a matter of philosophy, ethics, and politics. The goal of modern economics as a discipline is to *inform* politicians and the public of *what effect* any potential policy might have. So, as in your example, spending 1B on ditch digging has a larger impact on GDP than spending 100M on teachers because spending 1B on ANYTHING is 10x as much as spending 100M on ANYTHING. Whether or not it is a good idea is a political decision. I'm ignoring of course the fact that if you have 1B to spend on ditch digging you could conceivably spend it on absolutely anything else including the teachers or some combination of both, which is the primary reason why your question was silly. If the question is, what is the optimal way to split 1B dollars between ditch-diggers and teachers, you could use quantitative models to determine how to allocate the money most efficiently."

Dating, for most guys, is the first time they realize that they are treated differently because of their height.  This comes even before the realization that it extends to other parts of society too.  I think that this is because, before the internet, there was nothing explicit about it.  As Paul Simon said, ""there were incidents and accidents; hints and allegations"".  

But now, there is no reason for a dude to be as clueless as this guy: ""Im still as tall or taller than most girls"" and ""Yeah Im not worried. A girl worth my time wouldnt care about something like that"".

Something tells me that he hasn't read any studies about this subject.

The only time you should really max bloodlust early is if you're safelane support, ideally with a hero that really benefits from bonus attack speed.  If you're roaming you will get more value out of maxing your nukes first with 1 point in bloodlust.  

Second, if you don't have both of your nukes maxed by 25 minutes in the game you're really playing from behind.  At 25 minutes in you should be level 10-11, and in that case you definitely want your fireblast maxed and multicast at rank 2.

Yes, I was very tall for my age. But, I don't think it ever really registered until then that I was so much taller than everyone else.

inevitabled34th,AskReddit,1391116989.0,"I hate all the people on Reddit who think America went to Iraq for oil. Saddam was an evil dictator who killed millions of his own people because he could. For years, he poisoned his own citizens with mustard gas. He didn't shoot them, he let their insides burn until their bodies became nothing but empty shells.

And this whole crock of shit about ""There were no WMDs in Iraq. We went for nothing!"" Saddam HAD hundreds if not thousands of WMDs in the late 80s and most of the 90s. We knew he had them because he used them against his own people. We gave him several chances to let UN inspectors come in and make sure that there were no WMDs. Every time Saddam would either cancel the inspection, make up some bullshit excuse as to why we couldn't come in, or he would bar the inspectors from entering the country. Since the end of the Gulf War of the 90s, we gave Saddam over 10 years, **10 FUCKING YEARS**, to let UN inspectors search his facilites for WMDs. He never let them in.

The Muslims that attacked us on 9/11 were linked to Iraq. They were from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, but got terrorist training in Iraq. If we knew that they were getting their training from Iraq, what makes you think we would have just stood by and let them continue churning out more terrorists?

Oil was a by-product from the Saudi government for not only stepping in and taking care of Saddam, but also for protecting their government. A lot of our bases were on Saudi terrain, and a lot of our men never left Saudi territory.

The oil fields in Iraq were taken over by the Saudis and **protected** by us. We didn't own the fields, we protected them so the Saudis could pump them and then send a mass sum of the oil to us. Why do you think we have such a strong relationship with the Saudis? Of all the countries in the Middle East, we have the strongest relationship with Saudi Arabia, except for Israel of course. I honestly don't know why were allies with them. They give us nothing. But I digress.

Recap:

*Saddam was an evil dictator that killed millions of his own people

*He did have WMDs, and we gave him plenty of time to let the UN inspectors look in his facilities

*We knew that the terrorists that caused 9/11 were linked to Iraq

*Oil was a by-product of the war, mainly as a result of our great relationship with Saudi Arabia

*Something about Israel

**tl;dr: We went to Iraq to liberate their people of Saddam, not for oil.**     "

wut wut wut wut wut

&gt;   I am kind of peeved that she is getting so much support for doing something so irresponsible when we are getting nothing

Don't let the jealousy get to you.  It's so easy for people who work hard for things to see those who get them handed to them on a silver platter and say ""THEY don't deserve that.  I DO!""  Those are two different things:  maybe they don't deserve the support they're getting, but that's none of your concern.  And maybe you're awesometastic and deserve support, but none is forthcoming for a myriad of reasons.  But that's not your friend's fault.

&gt;  especially impossible for me to be a bridesmaid

This is straight forward.  OP:  ""hey, super niave friend, I'm so sorry I can't be a bridesmaid in your wedding; with it so close to mine, I wouldn't have the time, energy, or brain power to do a good job at it, and it'll really be crunch time for me, so I can't have the added responsibility.  I really want you in my wedding, but I understand if that's not possible now, with yours being right before.  Please let me know by X date if you'd like to stay in the wedding party, or if you need to get out, to focus on your own wedding.  I appreciate the notice so I can ask someone else and give them plenty of time to get their dress and stuff.""

&gt;   I do not want to lose her as a friend.

The fact that you're friends with her says you should voice your concerns about her marriage, but her being naive about the world makes me think she won't listen.  

If you can find a way to tell her your concerns without her taking it as a personal attack, I recommend it.  Otherwise, just try to be there for her, but do NOT compromise your own wedding to do so; you've worked hard and for a YEAR to make your event what you want, and her personal choices should affect that."

OohLongJohnson,Music,1391117113.0,"1. Both of the artists are notable for how creative their lyrics are and for NOT rapping about the same thing as every ordinary rapper. Please listen to Section 80 before dissing Kendrick. 

2. Even ""radio rock"" has changed significantly (see 80s, 90s and 2000s rock charts). Van Halen, Third Eye Blind, Sublime, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Death Cab for Cutie, Arcade Fire, (imagine dragons this year) - these are bands that fall under the rock umbrella and have had major chart success in that span of decades yet they sound very different.

Rap has also absolutely branched off into many subgenres. There is more to rap than what is on the radio. Check out /r/hiphopheads.

I think some people might have forgot how vital he was for Chelsea last season. The games he was injured or rest for example Chelsea - QPR (0-1) were the games we ended up losing or drawing 90 percent of the time. He was that brilliant catalysator to our midfield who also managed to average nearly an assist or goal per game.

However I trust Mourinho and in the long run he made the best decision. I think Mata has reached his potential and there´s a lot more to come in Oscar and Hazard. Also he´s not te typical definsive minded player who would fit into Mourinho´s Chelsea system. Bright future is ahead of us and Mata is just a chapter in our history now :`("

That's an interesting thought in itself as there are relatively few situations that would demand a constantly together group of trans characters.  That, I guess is a bit of a trope in itself to suggest that trans people tend to be solitary!  

I definitely agree with the need to make fully developed characters, it'd be a boring show otherwise!  There are plenty of reasons for  a show to include transgenderism as a theme in that it is another facet of people in general.  Me being trans is not **everything** that I am but it is a facet, an important and slightly unusual one.  I'd also prefer not to see ANY jokes about people being fooled, about surgery, about dressing, etc, that's just transphobic, but there can obviously be something inherently funny about a situation where that is going on.

It's also a fine line to walk in terms of looking at the transitional process as it is phenomenally difficult and painful thing to go through for the majority of people.  For that however, there is probably plenty of material right there provided it is done right and whereas few people want to concentrate on the transitional process in their lives, I find it currently to be quite all consuming for me and most trans people I know would agree.  It can be difficult to see what's going to happen at the end, will my life 'start'?  Of course it won't but it will be a beginning.  

I'd love to see a good comedy drama with good actors and a good script, I'd want it to do for trans people what West Wing did for me with American politics when I watched it!  I imagine at that point being trans or GQ or whatever would almost have to take a back seat to the plot and everything else.  You'd know it was about trans people but the fun of watching would be where it was and why to watch the show.

Unfortunately you would, without doubt, draw a lot of flak about it from a fair proportion of the community.  Just like most communities people disagree and if there's one thing I've learnt about being trans it's that everyone's reality is valid and a lot of people have extremely different ideas about what it is to be trans.  You'd never please everyone and in actual fact, I think you'd be lucky to please 50%!  It is vastly complicated and although it's always been a part of life, it's just getting started in terms of understanding and support AFAIK.

I'd love to see something done well so good luck and I hope we can help!  Le reddit is a proper melting pot :)"

firehatchet,explainlikeimfive,1391117322.0,"And as for why some foods are okay and others not, is that the production of some dairy products require the removal of lactose. In general, the more processed, the less lactose. Most hard cheeses (parmesan), for instance, contain no lactose, unless they are no or low fat versions (which may contain a little). Yogurt (particularly Greek), quark, cottage cheese and the like contain moderate lactose. Milk contains the most. Look on the label of your dairy products and eliminate the ones with a lot of carbohydrates, unless the carbs are coming from an obvious source other than lactose, such as added sugar in yogurt.

You can avoid high lactose dairy altogether or get lactose free milk. If you get a lot of your protein from dairy, your can get a variety of lactose free protein supplements from Walmart, GNC, etc. If dairy is your main source of calcium, you can also take a calcium tab for that. 

Just some tips, do how you see fit. No one knows your situation better than you. Corn intolerances run in my family, so I'm aware that it can get, quite literally, very shitty. Hope you can find some new foods that work for you!"

SoyBeanExplosion,Christianity,1391117364.0,"&gt;Yup – though it was only really a dilemma for polytheists (who’s gods were just random beings that happened to be stronger than you, so there’s no a priori reason they should be obeyed), as we’ll see

Its relevant to what you were saying though. The same problem exists.

&gt;The issue here, though, is that what makes murder wrong is the fact that its not good. It decreases the amount of good in our world.

&gt;And good isn’t some outside force from God - God is good. God is to good like what Christ is to God.

If this is a ""fact"" presumably you'll be able to provide evidence to prove that? Its a rather revolutionary step forward for ethics if you can.

Its just entirely circular logic. All you've said is ""murder is bad because it is bad.""

&gt; Having free will just means that you can choose your actions – it doesn’t imply anything about what the consequences of those actions might be

What's the point in allowing humans to choose their actions if the result is then already decided? Either obey God and go to heaven or disobey and.. Well whatever your denomination believes. Sure you've been allowed to choose which of those options you want but are you seriously pretending the second choice is a reasonable one at all? "

ohgeronimo,Buddhism,1391117479.0,"Yep, also known as Saiyuki or Journey to the West. It details the fictional journey of a monk known as Tripitaka (a real monk by the same name was said to have made the same journey only with less demons and magic) travelling from China to India to fetch the teachings of Buddha so that his kingdom could make copies and spread the teachings among their people.

**Spoilers below. Repeat, spoilers for Monkey below.**

It covers many many years before his birth in the form of celestial happenings in the heavenly court and the ""hatching"" of monkey from a stone egg ontop of a mountain infused by the energies of the universe. Progressing from his mountain home with real monkeys, to travelling to the human lands seeking the end of death, Monkey begins to take on more human form as he learns more of their ways. Eventually, by training with a sage, he earns the religious name Aware of Vacuity, as well as many sorts of spells and transformations. And causes quite a bit of trouble as it's discovered none in the heavenly court can defeat him. So they give him a position. As a horse master.

When he discovers this he's quite upset, causing more trouble, and finally only Buddha can defeat him. Doing so, Buddha imprisons him beneath a mountain for quite a long time while being unable to die. Many years later the monk is found through a series of prophetic dreams and guidance by Kuan-yin, and set upon his path towards enlightenment.

Kuan-yin organizes it such that the king sends Tripitaka on his journey with some magical artifacts. The first disciple he encounters in Monkey, and with the help of a band about the head that tightens when reciting a mantra, Tripitaka is able to tame him and take him on as guardian and disciple. Kuan-yin has also organized two other disciples, likewise punished by heaven for various reasons, and Tripitaka takes them on as well. Also, a dragon prince that serves as a horse.

They journey westward, towards the Thunderclap temple, encountering all manner of demons, humans, spirits, and Taoists. Tripitaka normally tries to manage encounters peacefully, and in doing so helps train his disciples against their violent and willful ways. His three disciples all possess martial prowess and magical ability, so they use that quite a bit as well.

Eventually they come to the temple, but not before being met by a river that only Monkey can cross by walking across a slippery bridge. Luckily, there's a ferryman. When entering the boat however they discover their physical forms floating away in the river. Reaching the temple they are welcomed as enlightened, given titles and duties, and allowed to take scripture back to the kingdom. An incident happens on the way back, washing away some of the scriptures, leaving them with only three baskets. Distraught, they plead to Kuan-yin, but she assures them these three baskets contain the whole of the teachings and they were only ever meant to have these three baskets to bring back. With help from Kuan-yin and spirits they make it back to the kingdom much quicker than the initial journey took, and the teachings of Buddha are shared with the people of China.

I'm not sure how entirely accurate it is about Buddha's teachings, as they seem to be presenting them through the entire series of stories, but supposedly the story was originally made as a way of presenting religious information that at that time historically was in danger of being lost.

The copy I have, translated by Arthur Waley, omits some stories, but keeps the bulk of the story progression intact. It's a really fun adventure, in my opinion."

privatedonut,AskReddit,1391117506.0,"Was bullied a lot in middle school and early high school, especially one kid named j.  I was probably bigger, i've always been the gentle giant type, and I never knew how to stand up for myself.  But j was also pretty big, and knew exactly how to get on my nerves.  All three years in middle school he was the worst, I felt tormented every day and didn't know what to do.

Eventually high school came, and I rarely saw him.  I slowly grew up, stopped many of the things that got me bullied, and became more confident in who I am and my ability to stand up for myself.  Still try to be nice, but not afraid to talk back anymore.

Just out of high school me and a couple friends decides to go to six flags now we were finally adults.  My friend l decided she needed to bring j, who she was good friends with.  I was rather upset at the idea, but I also had a crush on her and wouldn't dare say no to her.  He came.  We all walked around all day, enjoyed the rides and such.  One ride, I believe the wizard, he didn't want to go on.  Said it was boring I believe, which it is.  I'm still a bigger guy and the rise was tiny, I knew from the past I shouldn't try to go on it.

So he went to sit down, and I decided rather than just let this keep stinking the air, let's figure it out.  Or at least, talk to him.  I changed, maybe he did.

This is when I found out why I rarely saw him.  Looking back he may have been playing with my mind, but we sat down and just talked.  About middle school, sorry for bullying you privatedonut, nah man I was an annoying little shit, it's behind us anyways.

After middle school he got into pot.  So did I, he was surprised at that one, but I got a lot of respect for it.  But his family wasn't always well adjusted.  His brother got into other drugs, mainly cocaine and dealing it.  So j got involved as well, but it wasn't long before he was caught.  Being underage, he was put on house arrest, and I rarely saw him again.

He told me a lot about it, but in that moment I felt lime we had some respect with each other.  We became friends a bit in that moment.  Never talked to him after that day, but for  moment it felt as if I saw a whole new side of him, the kind the movies always show of the bully had a rough childhood and couldn't help but be angry at everyone else and be mean.

As I said, I don't know for sure if his house arrest was real, but I didn't get revenge, I didn't laugh at any karma coming into effect.  I met my bully years later, and it felt amazing we could both make amends and see each other as people for once, rather than the wolf and rat it used to be.

TL;Dr: met my middle school bully after high school. We each gained new respect for each other."

Look at the verse. Num 15:35. God said that the man should die.

&gt;And your examples aren't anything that would help the person at all 

Says you. Maybe the neighbor would be evicted. Surely you won't let your neighbor be evicted. Are you saying letting him have a place to sleep won't help him? 

But you agree, there is a higher law that says no, don't do that. Is that U.S law? Are you allowing U.S law stopping you from fulfilling God's command? Or is it because theft is against God's law, and you won't break God's law to help your neighbor?

So, why is the Sabbath different? The Sabbath which God commanded. The Sabbath where God said to not gather food in Ex 16:26. Or where he said to not make a fire in Ex 35:3? Or that gathering is not allowed in Num 15:35?

Smear thoroughly with pesto (from a jar, unless you have piles of homemade pesto around), and salt and pepper - the basil really brings a nice green fresh flavor - and if there's a very thin end, I put foil across that end of the dish or fold it under itself to make that section about as thick as the rest.

450 degrees until just cooked through, 12-15 minutes.  Really, you're aiming for about medium to medium-well inside - very hot but still a little soft.  You want a sleek translucenty orangey-pink, not a chalky pale pink.

If the pesto doesn't float your boat, I also like several tablespoons dijon mustard mixed with 1-2 tbl melted or soft butter and about a quarter of a lemon's juice."

Username_of_Sean,AskMen,1391117691.0,"The wording on that implies more than the one saying it means.

My girl is collared to me. She has given me ownership of her, including her body. She has said that since it's mine, I can do whatever I want with it whenever I want, and has even clarified that, if I was so inclined, whether or not to stop whatever I'm doing if she uses a safeword is up to me, not her, and that nothing I do to her could be rape.

This all came from a girl who knows that I have sexual fantasies involving murder and cannibalism. She would like to stay alive, with all her body parts attached, and would be very upset if I decided to do her permanent harm, but she has essentially agreed to it if I ever decided to.

I would never harm my girl. I would never continue after a safeword comes up either. The other half of my girl wearing my collar is that I chose to put a collar on her. I chose to take responsibility for her well being. Both halves are expressions of love.

So it definitely CAN be... But at the same time, it's not necessarily. Lady Gaga's new song comes to mind, where she sings: 

&gt; You can't have my heart

&gt; And you won't use my mind but

&gt; Do what you want (with my body)

&gt; Do what you want with my body

&gt; You can't stop my voice cause

&gt; You don't own my life but

&gt; Do what you want (with my body)

&gt; Do what you want (with my body)

Here, it's a more passive gesture in a clearly physical-only relationship. It's clear to me that these two examples come from very different mindsets. Whether or not it's a gesture of love is something we can't tell you. It all depends on what the girl is thinking. Context can help."

slangwitch,jobs,1391117762.0,"Are you treating them with the same respect and deference you would treat a male with seniority? There is the tendency among some people to treat older women as motherly figures to be coddled by rather than as respected supervisors to impress. If I noticed an underling treated the male managers one way while behaving in a different way towards the female managers then I would judge that person negatively. Re-imagine your interactions with these women as though they were all older men with far more years of experience and seniority than you have. Can you say that you are behaving in the same way towards men as you do women?

Also, when in a meeting where these older women are accompanied by men of similar rank and status who do you defer more to? I am referring to both verbal as well as physical (body language) methods of conveying attention and respect. People learn to determine the level of respect you are showing them in comparison to others and if they feel that you are not treating them in the manner that their life experience deserves then they will develop negative opinions of you. 

Just something to consider. I think it is similar to a waitress who continues to defer to the man in a couple as she may subconsciously believe that he will be paying the full bill only to find that the check ultimately gets picked up evenly or solely by the woman and her tip from the woman is terrible because the waitress had effectively ignored her in favor of the man all night. That's an issue of respect and acknowledgement and is incredibly important with superiors as they will expect some humble deference from you as their newbie subordinate. "

So much so, in fact, that many of them were willing to work longer hours if it meant that they would have more resources which they could use to persuade widget-owners to let them use their widget.  This sort of asymmetry would quickly give rise to a system in which widget-seekers usually worked harder, but nobody ever decided that widget-seekers should work hard while widget-owners should relax.  That's just the way the system develops given the fact that one party is born with something the other party wants, and is willing to work for access to it.  You can't simply choose to tie widget-owners to hard work because the factors that link widget-seekers to hard work occur at a much more fundamental level.

Yeah, we straight up stole that land.  I guess you could call me a settler.  Where am I going with this? There has never once in the entire recorded history of the human race been an independent country called Palestine.  There just hasn't.  Israel took some land from Jordan during a defensive war.  Land that Jordan used to invade Israel (multiple times).  In the 1980s Jordan relinquished all claim to those territories.  Therefore, Israel was no longer occupying them from Jordan.   And since there has never once ever been a country called Palestine, it is a flawed analogy to compare the SodaStream plant there to Mexico building a factory on American soil.  Never mind the fact that the area where the plant is located is widely agreed upon to be part of the territorial swaps that will take place between Israel and the newly formed nation of Palestine when peace talks finally come to fruition.

&gt; In real life, people like you for being a girl. They want to fuck you.

Okay, great, so right off the bat, we've established that there are girls, and there are people. Yeah, this underlying sentiment is *absolutely* correct. You can just as easily say that men get special treatment because women want to fuck them. Which is obviously not true. The only reason people like you or the OP believe this shit is your victim complex from perceiving all women as bitches for not wanting to fuck you. You know who people want to fuck? Attractive people. Of either gender. How about, ""there are no attractive people on the internet?"" Oops, now we're not being sexist, that's no fun.

&gt;When you make a post like ""hurr durr, I'm a girl"", you are begging for attention.

Or, you might be identifying yourself to provide context for your post. We experience things differently depending on identity. For example, if we're in a thread talking about racism, identifying as ""black in NYC"" (or whatever) is relevant because it provides context for personal experience. Or, if we're in a thread talking about experiences on the internet, self-identifying as a girl is relevant, because assholes like you constantly make the internet a hostile place for anyone with a vagina. It has nothing to do with seeking special treatment. Girls actively *don't* want special treatment on the internet, because their ""special treatment"" is consistently sexual harassment, rape threats, insults to intelligence, and the weird childish gender warfare bullshit you're peddling right now.

I can't fucking believe how many upvotes are going to this crap. Men and women have been on the internet in equal numbers since 2000, yet clearly this thread is clearly populated mostly by sexist men. Are you happy about that? Because its the fault of people like you. Do you really have no interest in interacting with people because they identify as a particular group? We're on the greatest communication device in history, and you choose to use it to continue to seclude yourself from billions of people because you resent them for being different. It's not because women are the beneficiaries of favoritism - when controlling for career choice, position, qualifications, etc., starting salaries are less for women than for men because assholes like you perpetuate your superiority complex. No, the only ""special treatment"" that women get is coming from you. You want to level the playing field? Grow the fuck up and stop being a fucking sexist asshole."

You can't expect your bf to change, especially since you've voiced your concerns and things still have not changed. He is who he is and you are who you care. Compromise in relationships can be made, but you shouldn't be the only one compromising all of the time.

Good luck."

The main reason I say, ""It's ok."" is that shaming women for shaming men... it's just a vicious cycle.

Building yourself up to the point where someone's shame doesn't affect you, that stops the cycle.

So yes, it's not ok for them to do what they do.  But the answer isn't to go after them.  The answer is to say, ""It's ok.""  And build yourself up so they won't be able to affect you.

Also, the past is the past.  Ain't nothing we can do about it now.  Whatever responsibility you feel about your husband and children is not worth holding onto because you can't go back.  You are only responsible for what you do now.  And it sounds like now you're on the right track.  :)"

Noneerror,raisedbynarcissists,1391118227.0,"My suggestion is to talk to your husband. Have a long conversation about how she has treated you in the past and how it is still ongoing. If you wish to go No Contact or Limited Contact then if he's willing he can communicate on your behalf and then that's that. If that would not be appropriate for your circumstances then perhaps a letter. Set whatever terms you want for her.

The advice here is to not talk further with your narcissist. IE just stop communicating completely and never explain why. I disagree with that advice. I believe it's important to have closure for yourself. To talk *to* them, not talk *with* them. You don't want it to become a negotiation. Informing them that they no longer get a say in your life is very therapeutic."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1391118414.0,"I think your relationship sounds very healthy (from what you've shared) and there is no reason anyone should make you feel you need to defend your choices. I find that sometimes feminists turn their nose up at women who prefer traditional roles, but they overlook the fact that you aren't following tradition to conform, you do it because it suits you. And ideally, every woman should have the choice to do live life in a way that suits her, not some sort of ideal. 

I think there are also some of us who are so ingrained with the notion that we need to challenge gender roles by being a ""strong woman"", whatever we construe that to mean, that we overlook what will actually make us happy. Some of us are more submissive...that does not mean we are weaker. We have to resist holding these prejudices against ourselves.

For instance, when I was younger I had all these ideas about sexual liberation and decided I would like free love, but when I actually started having sex, I realized my preferences were more conventional. That doesn't make me less sex positive, it just means I realized that I don't have to live my life by some sort of philosophical ideal. But it took me a while to come to grips with feeling like I failed somewhat by not liking what I thought I should like. "

Human knowledge and language fails to truly grasp what's going on where God is, because it isn't a where, or a when, or anything that is remotely easy to comprehend. Obviously God can and does intervene because, well, He's God and He does as He sees fit. That's a given. However, within time and God's fingerprint notwithstanding, our actions are our actions, whether it is or we know it's God's direct action or mere circumstance, our responses are our responses and we are beholden to them. Otherwise we can just export our sinfulness to being ""God's fault"" because it's all technically ""God's action"" that caused it all, Him being the Prime Mover and all. For me, this all boils down to: ""God's plan and influence for/on us both individually and as a whole is a mystery, all we can truly do on our end is to believe and trust in Him."""

i2ndshenanigans,AskReddit,1391118433.0,"First you have to want to quit. Not wanting to quit and trying to quit almost always ends up in failure. My wife and I wanted to quit for a while and one day we added up how much we were spending per month between the two of us and we quit the next day. My 2 pack a day habit plus her pack/pack and half was costing us 700+ a month. We quit 6 years ago.

The cravings will still pop up from time to time so don't expect to never want a cigarette again. Strong will power plus a real desire to quit will put you on the right path. 

If you need help quitting try a few cessation products not the ecigs the act of puffing on the ecig will just continue the physical habit. The patch worked well for me the first time I quit but I got some crazy dreams with that shit so I stopped using it. The gum requires you to spit while using it, or it did when i used it, so keep that in mind. The hardest part is getting past your triggers and routines. It was really hard for me not to have my morning cigarette once I got past that it was easy sailing. The last and final time I quit it was cold turkey."

CarrowCanary,sto,1391118528.0,"Best advice I can give someone hunting the pink crystals is get a Klingon (KDFRom also has access to all of this): 

* Border defence gives 1,440x4 a day.  
* Pi Canis daily pays... I don't know the exact figures, but... a fair bit. There are 2 smaller dailies of 3 maps each, and also a wrapper mission that completes if you get all 6 optional objectives. 
* There are also several kill missions (50 ships, 10 turrets, 50 ground enemies etc), 480 dil each.
* If you don't mind a bit of PvP, there's also dil for killing other players (both ground and space), and for winning in places like Ker'rat, N'vak, Take and Hold etc.

* Marauding DOffing will get you plenty of Contraband, either to sell or to hand in 5 for 2k dil. 
* You'll also get prisoners from marauding (and some Tactical mission, Strike Against Fugitive Support Network is one of the better ones), which are worth 1k dil for 10 at a security officer, or a few hundred dil for 3/4 depending which labour camps you find. Assuming they don't escape, of course.

Stuff for both factions:

* STFs are a good source of dil. Especially if you don't need any gear, you can burn all your Omarks and BNPs into pink crystals too.

* Crystalline Entity/Cataclysm/Catastrophe Elite awards 960 dil.

* Battlezone, as already mentioned by Dodye, is great.

* As mentioned above, Contraband hand-ins. Feds either buy it on the exchange, find it in DOff missions (a lot harder than it is KDF-side), or use your own KDF characters to supply your Feddies.

* The Vlugta Diilithium asteroid, Beta Ursae block. Take an EV suit, and use your arrow keys. Scores over 775 get you a particle trace (you can sometimes get 2 traces from one node if you have the right Astrometrics DOff on duty). Also, if you find a Rich Dilithium Mining Claim in a lockbox, this is where you take it. Rich claims are worth up to 5k dil assuming you can get 725 or more.

rhymes_with_chicken,tall,1391118711.0,"oh...thought of another one, if you care to indulge.

up until 9th grade, I had never really touched a basketball. I played little league baseball and liked it a lot (though i had a huge strike zone).

Anyway, i guess the first day of H.S. was pretty normal. But, the 2nd day the basketball coaches had had a chance to see me walking the halls --all 6'6 of me at 15 years of age--and I guess they had a meeting. So, come lunch time on the second day of school, I had a new lunchmate: The 9th grade A-team coach. He introduced himself and said he's *REALLY* like me to come out for the team.

Me, a bit introverted and still overwhelmed by the whole H.S. experience, ""uh...I dunno. I just started my woodshop class in 6th period. I think I'm going to like it.""
There was a little more talk. But, in the end he was more than a little exasperated and left.

Day 3, the JV coach was my lunchmate. he introduced himself ""So, I hear you have woodshop 6th period? Sure you wouldn't like to just come and watch a basketball practice? You wouldn't have to play. Just have a look. I'll introduce you to some of the players.""
me: a little sheltered for my age ""uh...i'll have to ask my mom if that's ok.""
him: ""you do that""

Day 4, the 9th grade A-team coach is back for lunch ""So, I hear you talked to your parents. What did they have to say about basketball?""
I had actually blown the thing off. Never told my parents I was having lunch with the basketball coaches.
me: ""uh...we didn't really talk about it.""
him: ""well, you're still welcome to come and check out practice. I'm sure we can get you a pass from woodshop.""
me: ""uh..ok.""

Day 5: the Varsity coach walks up to my lunch table. Not only my table, but the cafeteria goes silent. I can't feel my legs and my head is swimming from the rush of blood that went to my head---not over the coach's presence (to be honest, I didn't know who he was yet), but from the entire lunch room's eyes directly on me.

ok, sidenote: Varsity coach is nationally legendary. I don't want to give too many details or you'd be able to identify him and/or me. Suffice to say this guy is Bobby Knight-like in the H.S. domain...with the stature and voice to pull it off as well.

So, ""coach"" made no beans about it. But, in retrospect this was the most polite he's probably able to pull off: ""Mind if I have a seat?""
me: ""uh, no. go right ahead."" (I can barely speak; heart is pounding; EVERYONE is looking at me)
""Look son, I'm gonna need you to go and 'try out' for the freshman basketball team.""
me: ""uh...ya. ok. I don't really have basketball shoes.""
Looks under the table at my size 15 canvas tennis shoes. ""Those will be just fine. See you at 3pm."" and, he got up and left.

my friends were all murmuring ""holy shit, that was coach so-and-so."" etc.

anyway. that was the recruitment process.

So, clearly I'd never played basketball at this point. After a month of practice I'd gotten a pretty good 8-10' set shot down. But, everyone else was doing jumpers. When I tried those I looked like an epileptic praying mantis trying to pick an apple. I was told ""don't *YOU* worry about those, yet"".

First game of the season (freshman B team) I scored 28 points all bank setshots from just outside the lower block, plus 3 freethrows (3 for 3). I also blocked 8 shots and never jumped. Just stood in front of the poor 5'6 post player I was defending with my arms up. we won. we won a lot.

She was still a weird shade of orange from tanning so much and she was 25 years old wearing Hollister and Abercrombie and I just felt weird knowing that I had grown so much as a person (not physically!) and she was clearly still stuck in high school.

Religious literacy is good, but they will fill his head with bullshit, so you need to counter it by discussing myths of the world (greek, norse, native america), and taking him to other types of religious services (Temple, Mosque) so he sees that Christianity is simply one of many options, and that's what grandma does, but daddy chooses none of the above.

Make sure he understands that the Jesus story is simply what some people believe, but there are many things to believe, and it's okay for anyone to believe what they want to."

Until recently, she was the only one known to still exist, and she's been in a coma for a vary long time. The belief of the Retribution is that the magic used by humans is draining the power and lifeforce of the elven gods, so clearly they must all be destroyed before the gods can be made whole again.

The Seekers believe that the elven gods are lost out in the world, and that they left clues as to what happened to them. The Seekers have gone out seeking those clues. Sylys works for other factions in exchange for access to their stores of knowledge. The Seekers don't hate humans or mages, and don't have much in common with the Retribution, aside from both sects being ostracized in Iosan society.

If the setup isn't more than a modem and wireless access point, probably nothing more than that you're connected and maybe how much data you're using. If they're running a proxy, which is a computer that intercepts your internet traffic, they could be logging what sites you're using. On regular websites, they could have the ability to log absolutely everything you're doing. Secure websites (like your bank, Paypal, other sites where you see a lock in your browser) they can see what site you're on (like mybank.com) but they absolutely can't see anything more than that. iMessage is fully encrypted, so even with a proxy all they can do is see that your phone is talking to Apple, but they can't read what you're saying, who you're talking to etc."

You can't say, ""I did this thing for you so now return the favor for me!"" Unless she asked for it in the first place she isn't being selfish. 

That doesn't mean she's a ""good"" friend though. She has her own interests and her own life. She isn't interested in her relationship with you. You're trying to make her go back to the way she was years ago. If you just met this girl a month ago, would you want to be friends with her? Forget her history and the way she was, would you want to be friends with the person she is now? It honestly doesn't sound like it. You're holding onto someone who just isn't there anymore. 

She isn't selfish or a bad person for moving on with her life. She has different priorities and that's fine. You have to accept though that she's just not the friend you want. You value different thing. You have to move on from her. You're only holding onto the way she was before, and that's not coming back.

* You can make your character almost as fat as Smough

* You only start with 1 estus flask

* Still hard as balls (if not harder)

* Penalty for going offline during an invasion

* Starting gifts do not include a master key, but there is one that makes the game harder

* It is possible to burn certain items (human effigies?) at bonfires in order to prevent invasions for a specific amount of time

* Resistance has been removed and some of it's effects may be implemened into agility

* Strength increases guardbreak damage of strength weapons

* Dexterity increases poison/bleed damage

* There are more upgrade paths, like a poison upgrade path

* You can rest at bonfires while being invaded or hosting friendly summons

* Beards

* Enemies are smarter (more aggressive when you heal, attack in groups, etc)

* Game will be rated T but still as violent (if not more) than Dark Souls

* You can jump by clicking the stick

* It is possible that all classes start at level 1, this is unknown

* There are now 4 ring slots

* 10 item slots

* 3 weapon slots in each hand

* You can now backstab and riposte with a shield

* When dual wielding, you can press Y to do stronger but slower attacks

* Endurance now only gives stamina, Vitality now only gives equip burden, Vigor gives health, Resistance was removed, Intelligence now affects pyromancy damage, and Agility gives roll speed, move speed, parry speed, and possibly other things.

* No longer level via bonfires

* Headshots cause a stun animation which can be riposted

* There is a starting gift that increases difficulty when burned at a bonfire (more black phantoms maybe?)

* You can now play left handed and block with a shield in your right hand (in DS1 you could only hit people with a shield in your right hand)

WazWaz,Android,1391119731.0,"Readers interested in this thread may be able to give me some advice...

Currently I'm selling WazHack as a one-time $2.99 upgrade. However, I constantly add chunks of new stuff to the game (rather than just moving on and making another game), and for the next version I add 8 more character classes (plus heaps of stuff to the base game).

The only way I can keep the price low with this development model is to divide the game up into separate $0.99 IAPs. From my data on iOS, most people don't want to play/buy all classes (all can be thoroughly tried in the demo), so making the game $7.99 would turn off a lot of casual players who just want to run around with their one or two favorite classes.

Not every chunk of new features means more IAPs (update 1.1 added a whole new dungeon branch, for example).

I'd be very interested in any comments as to this model."

No texting back and forth -- a time and place is declared and you physically go out and do stuff that is relevant to your interests with other adults.  It's grand. I've used it to go on cycling trips and other outdoor events. Through it I've met a great set of people.

- Risen 2 Dark Waters: This one is interesting, because I quit it 23 hours in. I just couldn't be bothered anymore. I really wanted to like it, hell, the devs made my favourite game of all time, Gothic 2, but DW was just so fucking uninteresting. But on the other hand it was still better than Gothic 4, which I finished (for some reason...).

- Gothic 3 Forsaken Gods: From the very first second the game displayed a severe lack of understanding for its main character (different devs, go figure...) and I just couldn't bear it. I quit not even half an hour in. 

- Two Worlds 2: I played it for a couple of hours, liked some aspects of it, disliked others, but just simply lost interest. The story is forgettable, and the gameplay isn't unique or interesting enough to make up for that.

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391120136.0,"&gt;I like your interpretation, how the Valar are not present during the War of the Wrath, but then how/when/why is Beleriand sunk?

I had interpreted it as Melkor's last desperate gasp, the effect of his attempts to stop the Host of the Valar from reaching Angband.

&gt;I do not see how anyone but Valar could take Morgoth's feet and bind him with Againor.

Well, Eonwe is described as the most skilled at arms in all of Arda. If anyone outside the Valar stands a chance, it's him.

&gt;The only non-Valar/Maia to have challenged Morgoth was Fingolfin, who, though he fought well and crippled Melkor, did not ultimately stand any chance of actually defeating him.

Fingolfin was a single Elf, alone, far from Valinor's good graces. The Vanyar host was presumably huge, and consisted of the most powerful race of Elves ever to exist, with Eonwe at their head, fresh from Valinor and with the blessing of Manwe. Meanwhile, Melkor had been weakened by his continued domination of others, and the subsequent spending of his spirit. I mean, the entire saga of Turin is basically Melkor spending all day screwing over a single human being mostly out of spite. That can't have zero cost to his spirit.

Also, we have non-Ainur overpowering Morgoth, albeit only for a time: Luthien puts him and his entire court to sleep, and is not herself an Ainur. Now, Luthien was exceptionally powerful thanks to her half-Ainur heritage, but she was still basically an Elf. Now imagine a massive army of Vanyar who are not *that* far off from Luthien, thanks to their tutelage under Manwe, and what they could do."

BlizzardofFlame,AnimeFigures,1391120200.0,ohhh so THAT's how that works. Shiieettt I know what I'm doing next time then. Thanks for that tidbit!
bombeater,OkCupid,1391120206.0,"Wow. The thing about kicking you out because you wouldn't fuck him made me cringe. I don't have any real advice for you except ""keep trying"", because it sounds like you just got really unlucky and ended up going on dates with a few scumbags. 

""Let's just make out"" should be a perfectly reasonable proposition for at *least* a few dates if you like the guy but aren't ready yet.

In fact, you asked in one comment if ""let's go back to my place"" is always code for sex. Maybe that is the right time for you to state some boundaries, as opposed to already back at your place/his place. They're all going to feel more forward than you're used to, but let's face it, somethin's gotta give, right?

How about ""Let's go back to my place and make out""... that should be enough to titillate any red-blooded young man, but also sets up some pretty clear expectations. If it's really gonna be an issue, he can say ""Is that all that's gonna happen?"" And you know what, at that point, he asked, so you can just answer: ""Yeah, probably"".

Is that weird? Maybe, but wouldn't you rather have him get butthurt right then and there, instead of after you've gone all the way to his place?

Another one that might work: ""Hey, /u/throwaway_okc_, wanna come back to my place?"" Then you can respond, ""Absolutely, but I need to make sure we're on the same page here. I like you, but I need a while longer before I'll be ready to have sex. It's just how I work. I'd love to go to your place and make out or chill, but sex is off the table for now. Okay?"" I'm sure there are more succinct ways too.

So maybe I do have some advice after all: maybe on the scale of ""mysterious possibilities"" to ""mood-killing robot lawyer boundaries"", you're falling a little too close to ""mysterious possibilities"", and leaving too much room for guys to make their boner-driven assumptions. So it's possible to inch closer to ""clear boundaries"" *without* completely eliminating the mystery. You gotta practice it."

Even more, you're right, a couple slices of bread a little bit of peanut butter and jam would be very cheap, but the issue is nowhere sells just two slices of break, and a dollop of peanut butter/jam. You have to buy an entire loaf of bread, and entire jar of peanut butter and an entire jar of jam. That's $15.00 right there and if that's all you can afford to eat, you'll probably go through at least the bread in about a day and a half, so it's not as cheap as you think.

Your personal financial situation and the way your life has gone (which from your attitude seems pretty cozy, probably white middle class male from a white middle class background) is not indicative of everyone's situation and assuming that it is makes you kind of an asshole.

I will agree with you, the super vast majority of lunch thefts are probably just someone being a dick, but there is the odd situation where due to things like working minimum wage and having medical bills or student loan debts or family emergencies can put people under immense financial strain. This doesn't make stealing someone else's food 'right' or 'correct' but it does move it into the 'not wrong' category. Kind of the ultimate ethical grey area."

KeenanTurnure,teenagers,1391120251.0,Saved a baby in a car accident. Unfortunately the mother died.
JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391120255.0,"&gt; Children: So a child from age 1 through 17 doesn't receive any UBI? With no wealthfare programs at all how will a single mother survive the first four years (pre-school age) of a child's life? Since she cannot afford either child care or to live on $15K.

This is primarily to prevent irresponsible reproduction, as well as fiscal issues. Sustainability is a big concern of mine. The more people get UBI, the smaller the piece of the pie gets, and I think kids should kind of be a financial disincentive if you can't pay for them on your own.

That being said, part of the reason I went with a $15k figure is in order to give someone enough extra money for at least one child. If I'm not mistaken, people currently on welfare with several kids already live on close to $15k, so....

Also, keep in mind, if the person is cohabitating, they will have someone else who also makes $15k, making the actual payment $30k.

&gt;Disabled people: Since you killed welfare programs they now live on $15K/year effectively (which given that some of them have higher than normal expenses and needs is not sustainable).

To be fair, I'd keep disability, which is a rather cheap program and only like $100 billion or so. I think that's under social security, but is separate from the social security I eliminated. It could also, alternatively be part of the medical system, since that figure assumes universal healthcare costing the government around $1.3 trillion a year. 

&gt;Medical deductions: Now healthcare is even more expensive...

I included UHC in this figure. Whether my estimate is wrong is up for debate, but I figure it would cost around $1 to 1.5 trillion if we can do it with the efficiencies of other countries. This is because the alternative would be to provide more UBI and pay for medical insurance, but let's face it, for the same price of getting people on an insurance plan, we can just provide coverage from the government. 

&gt;Charity deductions: So all the charities that might have stepped in to save all the poor, sick, and homeless caused by your welfare closures now also lose tons of money since their contributors are now taxed on their donations.

This is a downside, to be fair, but an acceptable one IMO.

&gt;Disaster relief: So if you get robbed, your house flooded, or similar no deductions from there either? Ouch.

Nope, but you would have UBI to live off of. Also, keep in mind, most people will pay fewer taxes than with the current deduction system anyway. And from my standpoint, those who pay more could probably afford the hit.

tangerinelion,todayilearned,1391120308.0,"It's not even just that men and women work different jobs (which itself is interesting - is it due to inherent differences in interest because of gender or is it an effort to remove women from certain positions).

There's also the fact that if you take a group of men and a group of women who both perform the same job you'll find that overtime goes chiefly to the men.  Obviously if you work overtime you get more money than those who don't.  Now the reason for women not working overtime has, primarily, to do with the prioritization of work and family.  In the case of single men and single women you still have women choosing to prioritize a social life over work more than men.

When you say that gender X makes Y% of gender !X you need to be sure that comparison makes sense.  Same job, same age, same experience, same hours.  The latter you can control for by ""base salay"" or ""base hourly wage.""  You should absolutely not go by what's printed on their W2s."

I used to work with affiliate web sites who would write positive reviews about our product in exchange for a commission when the reader clicked on the link and bought.  Part of my job was making sure that FTC disclosure notice was there.  Point being that, no the article shouldn't be censored but it should be disclosed that they got something for writing it.

Even if he does this he's going to be open to accusations of being a dickwad from the girl and anyone on her side once she finds out that he's started pursuing this other girl so soon after breaking up with him. He should just take this criticism in stride and let the chips fall where they may, it's better to be seen as an asshole then to pretend he's still into a relationship when he's not.  He doesn't owe it to anyone to be unhappy or stick around in a situation that he finds unfulfilling but he also doesn't have any defense against the charge that the way he handled the situation was [INSERT NEGATIVE ADJECTIVE].

s54b32dd,BuyItForLife,1391120668.0,"That sounds like a lot of money.

IMHO, winter jackets are not a BIFL item. I would rather spend $80 every 2-3 years on a nice, waterproofed jacket I can use without fearing a tear in the tech liner, etc. than $500 on a jacket I'm afraid to eat in because I might stain it/ruin the waterproofing/what have you.

I own 3 winter jackets; one was an $80 oakley jacket with a nice heat reflective/thinsulate liner that works nicely in weather below 0 (F) down to -30 degrees or so; one is a bright blue Eira jacket I got for $90 and wear in weather between 0 and 20 degrees, and the last is a light jacket from 686 I purchased on clearance, and wear during the spring/warmer winter days here in MN. They are all water-wicking/water resistant, they are all warm, I have worn them all skiing, and I *beat* on them relentlessly (I love skiing and outdoor activities), replacing each jacket every 3-4 years or so as my taste and activities evolve. I have yet to throw a jacket away because it no longer does its job keeping me warm and dry.

I could never buy an Arc'teryx jacket because I just don't see the value added in a $400+ jacket, since for me, I'll be rotating my wardrobe every 5 or so years anyway, depending on fashion and technology changes.

*Edit to add*: I prefer not to wear jackets with zip-in liners because in my experience, they aren't as comfortable (I've owned expensive Columbia/Spyder/Descente jackets with zip-in liners; it's not my preference), and the versatility isn't worth it for me. I don't want a ""one item fits all conditions"" jacket, as it's only ideal for a small subset of conditions, and I'd rather just buy jackets specifically suited to the conditions I'll be in. It serves my particular interest in winter sports better to simply use a different jacket more suited to the weather conditions for that day, rather than trying to buy one jacket for all conditions."

Better GPU, it will give a little boost in performance, costs the same, and it is the new generation.

500W PSU, only thing is that it is not Modular like the CX.

I changed the case thinking it might be cheaper, but hey case is really a personal preference you can go for whichever one you like (just check reviews first)

I love peanut butter but I can't have a spoonful and put it away because I'll end up scoffing the whole jar and hating myself so until they bring out individual servings I won't buy any.

I still binge a lot but I'm learning to control it."

On November 30, 1965 the Calgary Church Women's Community Care was incorporated and in 1976 the name was officially changed to ""Calgary Meals on Wheels"". In addition to the United Church, the Anglican, Baptist, Catholic and Presbyterian Churches supported the movement while interested volunteers and service clubs answered the call for help and proved to be the backbone of the fledgling organization."

There are a lot of good hooks to start converastions from here, and it says a good amount about where you've been and what you like to do, but not a lot about who *you* are.

Maybe another paragraph that goes into more of what makes you tick and what about you causes you to volunteer at local anarchist, feminist, collectively run bookstore?

Why organize bike rides?

adding the why could then tie to the what's in your ""what you are doing"" section.

**what you're doing**

nice.. well written, concise and good hooks for starting conversations.

**good at**

solid list, nice pop of humor.

**First thing**

I don't know.. the hair could also be a good bet unless you're wearing your hood up or a hat.  Otherwise, yea.. it works

**Favorites**

Well organized, reminds me I have a copy of infinite jest in a pile here somewhere and I ought to read it sometime.   Also surprised not to find any of Spider Robinson's Callahan's Saloon books mentioned since they also feature pun competitions.

**six things**

One of the better lists I have seen.  Well done.

**thinking about**

Good.. funny, try to avoid practicing too much on a first date unless she is equally enamored of the lowest form of humor.

**Friday**

Good social activity a lady can imagine doing with you.. and well phrased.

**Private thing**

It's not that I don't care or that they don't cross my mind, but that part of my life has passed now and I am a different person and have moved on. I date a girl for a pretty long time and she kept contacting me, and then started trying to add me back to Facebook (I kept explaining to her that I didn't want to be friends with her on Facebook), and finally for awhile she went quiet and I stopped hearing from her. Then recently I ran into her by accident and all of sudden she starts following me on instagram. I'm just to exhausted to block her or deal with all of that. 

So I'm curious, why do people want to get in contact with their ex. I just don't understand the reasoning. What's the point? "

codayus,todayilearned,1391121094.0,"While true, a lot of the work here is being done by the ""when adjusted for [...] same career"" part.

Women tend to work in lower paying careers; the ""caring"" professions (teachers, child care, nursing).  Men tend to work in higher paying careers (lawyers, surgeons, engineers).  If we assume that the pay of these professions is just some sort of natural law, and that men and women have these innate preferences, then the resulting difference in pay is just ""one of these things"".

But if we imagine that it's at least *possible* that the pay of teachers is low, at least in part, because it's a female-dominated profession, or that women are subtly guided into teaching over, eg, being a engineer because it's seen as an ""appropriate"" path, then you can't just ignore the resulting difference in pay.

Does this happen today?  I have no idea.  But I will note that my mother, some 40 years ago, wanted to be an engineer, and had the high school grades to support this.  She was strongly ""encouraged"" by her teachers and guidance counselor to choose a more ""appropriate"" career path, and ended up majoring in journalism rather than engineering.  Journalists make less money than engineers; my mother would have been expected to make less money as a journalist than an engineer, but that pay gap wasn't the result of her preferences, it was the result of raw sexism.  If we ""adjust"" my mother's expected career earnings for her career, then that pay gap goes away, but the entire point is that she was forced into a specific career.  Her experience was as blatant and crude example of sexism as you're likely to find, and yet if we ""adjust for career"", it looks like she didn't suffer sexism at all, since she would be making the sam pay as all the other women forced into journalism and other ""appropriate"" careers.  How does *that* prove anything?

(And given the gender split in some careers, it's hard to argue that this isn't still happening to *some* extent.  Also, adjusting for experience is a little problematic.  Women have children; this is a big interruption to a career.  All else equal, women will always have less experience, on average, than men.  You can say that it's biology, not sexism, and maybe so.  But the impact that taking, eg, 6 months maternity leave has on your career is not written in stone.  If society penalizes everyone who takes break, for whatever reason, on the grounds that they don't have as much experience as someone who does not take a break, this will still have a disparate impact on women.  It's fine to say ""it's not sexism"", but it still *exists*.)

TL;DR:  Yes, if you make those adjustments, women will earn 98% of what a man does.  However, the *average woman* still earns much less.  It's a bit like saying ""if we assume that a woman was actually a man, then she'd earn the same pay, so it's clearly not sexism!""  But that's actually what people mean when they talk about sexism.

Edit:  Yes, stats for current grads can make it seem like the problem is gone.  But the concern is that women don't rise as high as men due, especially in high paying industries.  Pointing out that *recent grads* don't have a gap doesn't address this.  You can't prove that a gap doesn't open as we age by showing that it doesn't exist before we age!"

wordserious,funny,1391121165.0,"Real story: I'm a foreigner living in the US (been here 10 years). I never cared about any sports, and on top of that I don't understand American football.

We try, but we both are pretty bored after 15 minutes and end up playing videogames.

I can tell that he's frustrated though, he wants to share this with his school buddies. I feel that I'm failing to provide him with something that is central to the culture where he is growing up, so I decide to take steps. I ask a good friend if we can go to his place and watch the game with him. I promise to be quiet, but I ask him to answer my son's questions and just to behave like any normal Broncos fan, so that my son can get some of the vibe from a grownup, even if not from his dad.

My friend replies with this: ""Sorry, but no. When we watch a game we want to be ourselves, we yell and scream and curse and I don't want your kid to see that.""

I replied: ""I really don't mind, that's very normal and I grew up with my dad behaving like that watching soccer games, so you don't need to tone it down on our account.""

He sighed and replied: ""Don't take this too bad, I don't want people who don't appreciate what we're going through watching a game with us. I don't want to have to answer questions. I just want to enjoy the game and you and your kid will be in the way.""

About two hours later I get a call from someone saying that they have my backpack, and that I perhaps have theirs.

How did the person call me? Well he had my number. We both went to the same high school. I ran into hardly anyone that I went to high school with on campus throughout my time there. We knew each other and were on good enough terms to have each others number but we never really hung out or anything. It turns out we had the same bag and we each unwittingly grabbed the others on the way out of the testing site.

alannathelioness,AskMen,1391121771.0,"For the sake of simplicity, everything I'm about to say applies to the situation of a guy approaching me, some of it will apply to other situations but this is mostly in reference to being approached.

Let's start with negativity. Negativity does not always equal creepy. I'm not expecting every guy that I turn down to react kindly and I don't think anything of a guy abruptly walking away (if you consider that negative) or scowling or even calling me rude (admittedly, I am sometimes). These things aren't creepy. It's creepy if they get in my face, make a threatening comment, walk away but continue to stare at me throughout the night. 

Ignoring boundaries:

I don't know why this happens but many times guys feel it's ok as they're walking by me to just reach out and grab my ass. Or even if I've only been talking to them for a couple minutes. Touching can be welcome but rarely would I ever want someone I've just met to touch me anywhere but my hand, arm or shoulder. 

I don't like being cornered or boxed in by their arms. Separating me from my friends on purpose is also a big no. 

Like I said, pushing the issue is another thing. If I turn you down once, that's it, you are not going to convince me no matter how long we talk. 

Other things that are borderline creepy:

Those guys who just circle the outskirts of the dance floor, watching girls dance and looking for any girl to grab and dance. This is probably not intentional for a lot of guys so it doesn't concern me a lot but you're much better off looking for girls to dance with *on the dance floor*. 

Meh that's all I can think of. Hope this helped? Like I said, creepy to me is more about feeling slightly threatened and I don't use the term lightly.

Snow itself is a pretty good thermal insulator so a small flame would take a very long time to boil off any appreciable amount of snow.

The black soot in the first video is likely being deposited by the flame, fused carbon structures from incomplete combustion of the fuel.

CalvinDehaze,vfx,1391121848.0,"Not the quality of the product, but of the skill involved to make the product. When you're putting a part on a product in an assembly line, you do the same thing over and over again. There's little to no thinking involved. When you're rotoing a shot, you have to think and come up with solutions. Each shot is different.
  
I've bid out roto and paint work to various companies in India and China and found that it's more expensive than you think. They came in around 1/2 to 1/3rd of the price that my LA-based company at the time was charging for the same work. Not 1/10th, which is what you would get in manufacturing. This sounds like a steep cut anyway, but studios know that they get what they pay for, and sometimes paying less means paying more at the end if the work is shitty. So paying 1/2 the cost for 1/4th of the quality doesn't make sense, unless you don't care about the quality, which most films do.
  
This is why India and China are not really threats to the VFX market. Many of the bigger VFX houses have opened up over there, like Pixomondo, R&amp;H, etc, but they're all finding that it's not worth it. That's why SPI is pulling out. Also, studios don't go to Canada just because VFX gets tax credits, but because the whole film gets tax credits. Pre, during and post, and sometimes your whole film needs to hit a certain spend in order to qualify for tax credits. Like 75% of your budget needs to be spent in an area. And since VFX could take up 1/3-1/2 of the budget, VFX producers have no choice but to hire companies in that area. THAT'S the real threat."

I did the 1.5 my pay thing and explained that the OT would be a pretty significant windfall for us and can go a long way in setting up our surprise family vacation this summer. She didn't want any parts of that, she just wanted to b*tch about having to make  her own coffee and cook dinner for the kids.

I told her about it prior to making the commitment and she told me to go for it, assuming I could keep up with the hours. She also said it was a great idea because we could put the money away for aforementioned vacation.

I told her that she's narcissistic and complains when I don't make money (prior to this I was unemployed or massively underemployed while I finished my degree and did the required internships and stuff), then complains when I DO make money, so I'm really confused as to what I'm doing wrong.

viceywicey,AskMen,1391121938.0,"I was just off the coast of Malibu near Point Dume State Beach gazing out over the glittering waves that told of a 3:00 in the afternoon, ish.  Time is different out on the water with nothing but your rod and a cask full of beers to drink in the view and pass the seconds away from the walls of my cubicle.  There's no sense of urgency, there's no wait.  Two hours we had been out here, catching all manner of nonsense, waiting for that one perfect bite to end the day.  To wait without anxiety is a peace I had been bereft of for years.

The captain had wanted to head in early, something about beating the breakwater rush and an incoming wind change, but I had convinced him of this feeling that my words couldn't quite explain.  It was as if the ocean, in its soft caress against the sides of our ship, beckoned for another chance to deliver some unknown satisfaction to trip otherwise made uneventful by the mediocrity of the catch.  ""30 minutes,"" he offered a muted growl, shaking his head as disappeared back into his cabin muttering, ""these kids and their dreams.""

I didn't feel the tension first.  My eyes caught her instead.  My rod tugged into the deep blue with an urgency that brought to life the man that slept within me.  I tugged and pulled, the striations in my forearms flexing and bulging under the strain as I fought to hold onto what could only have been a thorough bred warrior.  I shifted my stance, pushing my left into the side wall of our ship while bracing my rod against my hip to spread the force.  Such strength!  The very boat rocked as we fought to satisfy each our own desire - mine of victory and hers of life.

Then time actually stopped.  My eyes traced my line into the ocean, my only connection to it.  I could see into the waters at is slender but muscular body; lithe and white and so gracefully contoured.  There was no need to look her in the eyes, no need to acknowledge this short connection we had shared, this battle we fought.  I gave my rod a quick jerk, perchance one last effort to hold onto something that I could never have even called mine.

The line snapped then and with a brilliant prismatic burst of light and water, she leapt into the air and with a flick of her tail was gone."

Your life is going to suck for a little bit, and you're going to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the fuck just happened.  If you're like me, you'll blame yourself for a while and hate yourself, then you'll blame her for a while and hate her.  And then at some point you'll come to realize that you both had flaws and brought them to your relationship, and you may or may not decide that what she did was warranted.

It took me six months to stop feeling so destroyed it was hard to just get up.  I know this isn't encouraging, but it might be quicker for you.  Either way, it will get better.  You will get better.  My best advice for you is to make an effort to do things.  Join a gym, find a hobby, pick up Moby Dick and tell yourself that every time you despair you will just pick up that damned book and read another few pages.  This got me halfway through War and Peace.  I promise you, by the time you finish War and Peace you will feel better, and you'll have read half of War and Peace.  By the time I felt better, I'd also lost twenty pounds and taken up running, and made several other changes that helped my life feel more like something I could put back together.

Find a friend, find a therapist, start keeping a diary.  You need to get some of this stuff out to a sympathetic audience.  But you also need to just keep going, even if it's just for the sake of keeping going."

This will very likely make her give on any underhanded tricks. But she will resent you so much your relationship will start its death march.  If she doesn't end it right then.

You can try the pull out method, never have sex more than once a day, and tell her you think it is hot to cum on her.  But she'll ask you to cum inside her and when you never do, she will get pissed and stay pissed until she ends it or you end it because she will make you miserable. 

You can tell her that you need to be celibate until marriage to get closer to God.  But I don't think she will take that well at all.

Tracking her cycle is unreliable.  Just ask the Catholics.

You could wait till she gets pregnant and start pushing her down stairs until she miscarriages, but that is kind of mean.  And she might leave you before it works.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1391122269.0,"It's not the best study though. 

First off, most obviously, the sample comes from China, not the USA. (In case anyone hasn't read the entire article.)

Second, this is about whom they choose to message themselves and how that deviates from their marked preferences. This isn't about comparing their online preferences checklist vs whom they choose to stick with after meeting in person.

Third, too often, the article is conflating men and women's habits and at times it seems contradictory. One seemingly contradictory part is seen here:

&gt; In particular, *women tend to deviate much further from their stated preferences than men. That’s particularly true of attributes such as age, height and* **location**. However, they are much less flexible than men about marital status and number of children.

&gt; What’s interesting about these discoveries is that when it comes to certain categories such as height, education level, people’s actual choices are essentially random. These choices are indistinguishable from random selections, say Xia and co.

&gt; By contrast, people’s choices in categories such as age difference and **geographic distance accurately reflect their stated preferences.**

So which is it? That location matters or it doesn't? Common sense is that the more specific the information, the more accurate it likely is. The first paragraph speaks about women, while the third talks about ""people"". 

Suppose we give the first paragraph more weight, and women *do* deviate from their choices with respect to location. It's the men that are averaging it down. We can derive some possibilities from this, two of which are:

1. They are just having fun sending messages to people far away that they won't ever meet. A lot of Chinese girls like having long-distance pen pals. It's that stereotypical desire for attention.
2. The girls are more open to the possibility of moving farther away. This also generally true in China as the woman tends to move closer to or in with the husband's family after marriage."
Greggor88,fatlogic,1391122271.0,"That's because all chiropractors are quacks. They are medical professionals in the same way as a masseuse is a medical professional. Manual therapy has its benefits, particularly in relief of pain (much like a massage), but it's no substitute for real medical care.

&gt;A critical evaluation found that collectively, spinal manipulation failed to show it is effective for any condition. **The scientific consensus** is that chiropractic may be on a par with other manual therapies for some musculoskeletal conditions such as lower back pain, but that there is no credible evidence or mechanism for effects on other conditions, and some evidence of severe adverse effects from cervical vertebral manipulation. The ideas of innate intelligence and the chiropractic subluxation are regarded as pseudoscience.

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1391122416.0,"Okay, so first she needs something to keep herself busy that she enjoys. It sounds like she has a ton of free time. If she was kept busy it would give you time to do your own thing. 

Question though: Are you affectionate towards her? I know when my boyfriend doesn't seem as ""interested"" in the relationship I get much more clingy. Seeing each other less is much easier when I know the reason is because he's busy and enjoying his alone time versus not wanting to see me. When he's very affectionate I don't need the validation of seeing him all the time. 

It sounds like she might just be insecure? I do agree that you guys shouldn't be spending every waking second together, and it's something that needs to be worked on. Have you asked her why she needs to constantly be around you. The fact that she's asking, ""Do you want to see me,"" makes it sound like she's wrapped up your interest in the relationship in your willingness to see her. Really evaluate your part. Maybe you think you show affect to her but she needs it in a different way? 

It sounds like there's some underlying issue she's just not addressing. Honestly though I might be wrong and this just might be the way she is, whether you give her enough attention or not. In that case you have to make it clear that she needs to deal with this or it's going to have a negative impact on the relationship. Try talking to her first though and see if there's a reason why she's acting this way."

Most of the time, the PG13 rating is the kiss of death for an action or horror movie. In the case of Robocop, it's not like the original was made 'popular' because of its story or intense dialogue (""your move, creep"").

Obviously the film has themes and meanings, social/political commentary, satire, Jesus comparisons, as intended by Paul Verhoeven. But let's be honest, half the reason we enjoyed the original was because of the robotic cop shooting rapists and bad guys in the penis. And watching a bigger robot lose to a flight of stairs.

MrShiftyCloak,summonerschool,1391122515.0,"If you are looking to improve  at the game rather then just play for fun might I also suggest narrowing down the roles you wish to focus on. Imo learning the ""mechanics"" of a lane and how it should be played is as important if not more important then knowing how to play a champion well. As a support knowing how to have presence, trade, and where to ward can be transfered over to other support champs. As opposed to only knowing how to play thresh.  I would pick 2 maybe 3 roles to focus on even then assuming 3 champs per role there would be 6-9 champs you play which depending on your free time is a lot of time and effort if you want to get proficient at them to learn their counters or how to play them in difficult match ups. Annie thresh and karma are all good supports right now and vi Olaf and amumu are good junglers. Amumu is banned a lot so you could switch him for hecerim if you wanted. Those are my main two roles and my 2 cents. Once again this is assuming you are or want to be playing ranked and not just playing blinds with your friends."

She made fun of me, spread rumors about me, and generally made a big show of the fact that she was beautiful and popular and I was awkward and half-in-love with her still. She slept around quite a bit but all she ever did was tease me and talk about how 'one day' she was going to sleep with me.

Fast-forward a decade. I just had my 10-year-reunion. I'm now tall, fit, and successful. I've moved out of our shit town to a big city and made a life for myself there. I do really well with women. She has gained about a hundred pounds and works the makeup counter at Meyer and Frank. She got drunk and followed me around all night, talking loudly about how she was going to take me to bed that night, until I stopped and dressed her down right in front of our entire class.

ibbity,EngineeringStudents,1391122725.0,"I've been thinking about doing this for over a year now. I have a lot of engineering friends at this school, which is how I know that the engineering classes are more flexible than the architecture; engineering majors generally graduate on time, while it's not that uncommon for archies to take an extra year or two to manage to get all their classes in. 

What I have found to aggravate me the most about architecture is that it's way more artsy than I thought. I'm a very practical person and my idea is usually to find the best and most efficient solution to the problem, but no, the professor has to feel a certain way when he sees it and I have to make up a whole lot of BS about why I did x and y when the reason was basically ""because it works."" I go into my projects with the idea that I have a problem and I should solve it. Form seems to take priority over function and that drives me batty. I mean, I get WHY it is that way, but it's just not how my mind operates. My advisor told me that I might consider engineering because I sounded to him more like an engineer than an architect with how I approach things, I thought about it for a year and am now actually considering it."

open boxes aren't always easier to input data into anyway. Maybe someone's finger hits 3 instead of 2 and they input 350cm instead of 250cm.

mopeygoff,explainlikeimfive,1391122798.0,"I live in Philly. Been here 5 years. I used to live in Northeast FL prior to that (my entire life), so I can explain a little bit and how things are different here.

In order for snow to stick in the south, it has to ice up first. The last time it snowed in my hometown was 20-some-odd years ago. A Noreaster came through the night before and it rained. That rain turned to ice, sleet, and eventually big wet snowflakes like we see in October and November (not that small light powder stuff we've gotten lately). So you've got ice with a layer of snow on top of it.

Communities in the south also do not have snow removal equipment. No plows to stick on the front of the garbage trucks (that are usually not gov't owned anyway), no salt to spread on the roads, no brine apparatus, nothing. What you do have is people with rock salt for water softeners, but even then I've never seen more than a pallet at a time of rock salt in the stores considering a 50lb bag would last an average home 4-6 months depending on their water usage.

So you've got untreated blacktop with a layer of ice, then snow on top of that with no way for anyone to remove it. So Atlanta was all like ""Hey, business as usual!"" and went about their day until the storm hit and then were like ""ZOMG STORM BAD! GO HOME!"" and *EVERYONE* hit the road. It's not like up here where there's an excellent public transportation system. In fact, I heard that the Atlanta Metro area is the size of Massachusetts today and has a population of about 6 million.

So you had a million people (literally) all hitting the road at the same time, no mass transit, all on ice covered, hilly roads. Even if they brought in equipment it would have been useless because they couldn't get through the gridlock.

What did you think would happen?"

They're *the* most efficient structures to build, in terms of effort required and skill to complete. Cuboid structures require complex mathematics or they fall apart - how do you keep the roof from caving in? How do you keep the walls from collapsing outwards? Seriously, go find some wood and stack it up - I can say with 100% certainty that I can build a stronger, more stable pyramid than you can make a friggin' *cube.*

What's involved in making a pyramidical structure? Stack shit until it's the height you want. Whatever falls off the stack supports the stuff at the top of the stack. What's involved in making a cuboid structure? Calculation of height/weight ratio to prevent the structure from squashing itself (and forming a pyramid in the rubble, ironically enough), proper packing of materials to prevent collapse, proper distribution of building progress in order to maintain structural integrity...

We didn't figure out how to build structures with significantly more height than their base until the 19th century.

PA = Oasis of liberty among tyranny.

&gt;The state even mandates free speech on some private property!

Oh, the horror! Wait, I thought libertarians were supposed to be FOR free speech? What gives?!

&gt; The state does badly on alcohol policy, ranking 47th. Distribution is highly controlled and implicit taxes on wine, in particular, are excessive (over three standard deviations higher than the mean)

To be fair, I have to admit this is a valid point. You have to go to state controlled stores to buy alcohol.

&gt;The state has dramatically liberalized gambling, adding quite a bit to its treasury and placing Pennsylvania among the best states for gaming freedom in the country.

To be honest, I have to say this is a good thing. Love casinos/racetracks. 

&gt;Policy Recommendations

&gt;Reduce spending (especially on public welfare and state retirement benefits) and numerous minor taxes that are relatively high by national standards.

&gt;Protect property rights better by loosening land-use restrictions and eliminating mandated free speech at private shopping malls.

codayus,OneY,1391123189.0,"&gt; When I get some, it won't be as good as a woman's 

I don't see how you could say this.  Honestly, I'd guess that the average guy probably enjoys sex more than the average girl.  Certainly he's more likely to orgasm...

&gt; or intact man's

Although it's possible, studies have repeatedly confirmed that this is not true on average.

&gt; Women can have (multiple) mind-blowing orgasms that no prostate orgasm could ever match. 

And many women struggle to have an orgasm at all, while most women just can't orgasm from penatrative sex.  Tons of women would trade for the male ability to have quick, easy, reliable orgasms from penatrative sex in a heartbeat.  And uh...men are capable of being multi-orgasmic.  And prostate orgasms are pretty mind-blowing when done right.  Why are you so certain that women have ""better"" orgasms""?

(Incidentally, your orgasm type is dependent on your hormones, not your plumbing.  I've talked to transpeople and seen AMAs on Reddit, and the consensus is that once you start taking hormones the way they orgasm changes; a transwoman will start having female-style orgasms even without having reassignment surgery, and visa versa.  But while they have said that the orgasms are highly different, the ones I've seen who answered agreed that they weren't *better*.)

Also, not to be harsh, but your a 20 year old virgin.  Why do you think you know so much about sex?

&gt; With circumcision (I know there's conflicting data, but the majority of it agrees is that circumcised reduces sensitivity)

That is simply wrong.  See, eg, [this meta-study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23937309).  They found that most studies (and all the ones with good design) showed no measurable impact from circumcision.  Every study that did find a negative impact was poorly designed.  (Eg, if you ask men who got circumcised due to problems with their penis whether they have problems with their penis after circumcision, a high number will say yes, not because circumcision caused the problem, but because circumcision failed to fix the problem.  Studies show that a high number of circumcised men have penile cancer...because circumcision is a common way of treating penile cancer.  Once you control for that, the effect goes away.)

In short, the data is not, in any meaningful sense, conflicting.

&gt; I'm getting even less of the comparatively ""meh"" stimulation that natural men get.

It's entirely possible that this is true for you (although again, you're a virgin; how would you know this?).  But it's not true on average.  Do you have a reason to think it might be true for you?  Some people just aren't that into sex, you know...

&gt;  The best sex of my life will not be as mindblowingly good as a woman's, or an intact man's.

Sex is mostly mental, so..no.

&gt; It doesn't help that men seem to get the short end of the stick when it comes to sex.

Um...

&gt; for men, sex is restraint,

I have no idea what that is intended to mean, but I don't think it describes how *I* have sex.

&gt; and the pressure is on us.

That's the sort of thing men with low self confidence feel, yeah.  Of course, women think the pressure is all on them.  :)

Yes, men *tend* to take a more active role.  Doesn't mean you need to do it though.

&gt; Another way in which mensex is the training-wheels, kiddie-land version of sex.

I can't think of a way to interpret this that would make it true.  *OR* make it agree with your other comments about sex.  ""Sex for men is super hard; it's like you have training-wheels on""?  Isn't that a contradiction?

&gt; I'm not entirely sure what kind of responses I'm looking for.

Sympathy, probably.  And despite what it may sound like, I am sympathetic.  You sound very down and frustrated.  But the thing is...whatever your problems may be, I don't think they have much to do with your actual physical penis.  Sex is way, WAY more mental than it is physical.

You need to step back and think about your actual problems, and make fewer assumptions.  Are you having sex?  Is it fun?  Is it always a similar amount of fun?  What sets the good sex apart from the bad sex?  Except, well, you can't answer any of those questions, because *you're a virgin*.  This is like that old joke about the man who has major surgery on his arm, and when he wakes up he asks the doc if he'll be able to play the piano.  The doc says sure, and the man says ""great, because I never knew how to play it before!"".  You're stressing about why sex is bad...when you've never had sex, good *or* bad.  See the incredibly huge flaw here?

In any case...it's taken me years to really get in touch with my sexuality and start having really good sex.  At 17 I had a sex drive like an out of control forest fire, but the actual sex I was having was, well...bad.  15 years later-ish, and now it's not, but nothing changed *physically* about me, other than gaining a couple pounds.  :)


TL;DR:  Get laid; it'll make everything seem better.  (And this is where you go ""well, I would if I could!"".  I know.  But that's your problem; nothing to do with your penis.  Focus on that.)"

keakealani,singing,1391123292.0,"One visualization that works well for me is imagining breath support as the balance of inhalation and exhalation, pushed just slightly toward exhalation. In other words, your muscles should be coordinated to provide a controllable, steady stream of air, while simultaneously preventing too much air from coming out all at once, which leads to ""overblowing"" and tension around the neck and jaw. 

One of the problems with breath support is that it is really a phrase that describes several related, but ultimately distinct, processes. It talks about the muscular control around your diaphragm (remember that the diaphragm itself is an involuntary muscle, so we can only indirectly control it with other muscle groups around that area), but it also talks about the level of control needed to maintain a steady stream of air as we sing. It also requires understanding the importance of air pressure in vocal production, since many different factors (pitch level, dynamics, etc.) can influence the amount of air pressure needed to produce a healthy singing tone. When all of these goals are coordinated properly, that's what we call ""good breath support"", but it's really a lot more complex than one individual motion or process. "

I was in school with a girl for 10 years from JK to grade 8. She had a host of learning disabilities, including autistic traits that really put her at a social disadvantage. She was known for being ""weird"" and ""annoying."" I generally tried to be nice to her, but being young there were definitely times (sometimes stretching into periods of time) that I snapped and was very mean to her. Kids would often gang up on her to make fun, exclude, pull pranks, tease, taunt, etc., and I would join in with them, too. It was definitely a difficult 10 years for her.

We ended up going to different high schools and I lost all contact with her. I'd see her on facebook from time to time and remember how horribly I'd treated her. I felt awful and considered reaching out to her online to apologize, but I never did - until she reached out to me, four or five years after graduating from elementary school.

She told me that throughout elementary school, I was her only friend. She thanked me for being nice to her when everyone else was so mean. She described how she became depressed starting in the 5th or 6th grade and how that severely affected her throughout high school. She asked if we could meet up, so we did a couple times.

OK then, please compare all those things between the Model S and the Corvette. They're wildly different cars, true, but their performance isn't really that far apart. They're even in a drag race, for starters.

How would they do on a track? I don't know, you tell me. Looks like you've got at least three of each in your garage.

Also, in case you didn't get it, my point was that those wild differences between the Atom and the Veyron aren't really that big. Atom is lighter, but the Veyron has more power to compensate for the extra weight. In the end their performance is similar, even if they're very different technically.

Id recommend getting a sample if possible! Just a few tips if you do try it..  


- like most full coverage foundations, it is prone to looking cakey if you apply with a heavy hand. I recommend either using a beauty blender or a stippling brush, though its up to you!


- it takes a few minutes to dry and I find that if I wait a while and blot before I put on my finishing powder, it tends to stay on better, especially because its slightly fuller coverage :) hope this helps!"

baumbart,FinalFantasy,1391123694.0,"I mostly agree with you even though my first game was FFX, but I guess that way I can view both VI and VII more objective.  
&gt; I also dislike the way that the characters don't have their own special abilities and that their abilities and stats are based entirely upon materia and accessories. It makes for boring gameplay. I also really dislike the way equipment works; every character has one kind of weapon and one kind only, and one single piece of armor that is universal to all characters. There are no choices, no variation.

That's what bothers me too. I just like being given specific jobs for each character, that's what makes each of them unique. Or at least the way X did it, where in the endgame every character could learn everything. Something I don't like about VI is, is that about 1/4 into the game you get thrown at with thousands of espers with thousands of spells, and each character can learn any of them and you just have to figure out which esper benefits which character best. Besides from that, VI is just an awesome game.  
Also: Which mods did you use to enhance the graphics from VII? Maybe when it looks better, I could also finish the game for once. I am usually not a graphic whore, but VII just looks so chunky and .. just .. no. IX was released on the same console and looks wonderful in my opinion."

keakealani,singing,1391123777.0,"It's somewhat cliché, but really the pieces in *24 Italian Songs and Arias* (the low voice key would obviously be appropriate for you) are pretty solid audition pieces, and most of them are easy enough to be learned in a couple of weeks by an experienced singer. I like the suggestion of Ombra Mai Fu, and I think it's in that book. Something like ""Per la gloria d'adorarvi"" or Amarilli, mia bella"" might be good choices too. 

Remember though that in opera and classical singing in general, range is not the only characteristic that is important for determining roles and figuring out what repertoire is more appropriate for your voice. Some information about timbre/color quality, flexibility, tessitura, etc. would be helpful in pinpointing music that might be most appropriate for you. 

In other words, what specific vocal qualities do you want to show off? Is it that your voice is light and flexible, or big and dramatic? Do you have a strong upper range, or are you stronger in your middle or lower range. Do you sing long, melismatic phrases well, or do you do best in short phrases? Do you have strong acting skills that would be put to good use in a more singspiel type of piece, or do you want to just go for vocal artistry with a bel canto aria? There are a lot of options, and especially if this audition has anything to do with casting, it's important to choose rep that achieves your casting goals. 

Best of luck and please do respond with more info if you can :)"

Hawkeye1113,AdviceAnimals,1391123918.0,"This is one of my biggest pet peeves when I worked as a bouncer at a bar. It was/is a very popular upscale bar with a restaurant in the back, so I understood some people mistakenly trying to bring kids with them sometimes, although we had 4 signs on the door explaining no one under 21 or over without ID would be admitted, as we were a bar. 

It was especially amusing, as the people who often made the biggest scene about being refused entry were often the youngest age group, early 20 year olds. Occasionally I'd let one or two slide by depending on the age of the people with them, how old they possibly could be by how they looked, and if they were kind to me and understanding of the situation. If you threw a fit, out you went without much more than a ""fuck off and don't come back"". 

I used to tell people this, as it's a good rule of thumb: if you're under 35, no matter how old you think you may look, bring your ID with you when buying alcohol, tobacco, or going to a bar. You may get carded and some places have a strict no ID/no sale (or service) policy."

Also, very few states have a ""none of the above option"" which mean voters can't just vote out a member of Congress and hope for better options to emerge. Voters must vote for a replacement already on the ballot. Half of Waxman's elections he ran unopposed and only once (2012) did he face serious opposition.

This way they have the patents they wanted as ""protection"" patents against Microsoft / Apple etc without the burden of having to manufacture phones.
Lenovo now has the ability to manufacture phones with-out the cost of licensing the patents separately. 

I think it was win / win for Google / Android / Lenovo / Samsung because everyone comes out of this in a better position then before, and primarily with what they want.

As to whether we will see Windows Phones, I am not sure, I would like to think so, but it depends on what Lenovo had to concede to purchase the manufacturing arm in the first place."

pajamakitten,AskReddit,1391124048.0,"Literally the only problem is that I fear the food addict of past-me will resurface as a result of the diet I'll need to eat in order to recover. It'll need to be a lot of food, high calorie and high fat so it's basically a free for all on the foods I used to overeat on and I fear that once recovered I'll just stay that way and will go back to being overweight and unhappy again. Then the cycle will restart. Having understood healthy eating habits, a deep understanding of nutrition and picked up a desire to exercise I know it is unlikely to happen but it's just that niggling ""what if"" that concerns me.

I know that if I started I could do it in reality but because it's all theory at the moment I'm just scared of that first step. My friends all know about it, my family does and so do strangers online and everyone has been supportive to me which is great. Unfortunately it's me that needs to bring about the change and I can't convince myself to do it despite having a million reasons to do it and a damn good plan of how to go about it."

You know the 5 love languages thing? That could help. You might put all your effort into physical affection or verbal when she really appreciates the gift giving one (or vice versa). Definitely talk with her though and ask her what she thinks about all of this. She may not have even realized how bad this is for her. 

When you talk to her though focus more on why she feels like you aren't interested or trying to distance yourself. Once you resolved all of that you can focus on seeing each other less. Maybe planning in advance once a week having a few hours on your own. That way she can plan something for herself. It's definitely going to need to be an effort on both your parts (more so her than you). Try to open up communication though."

Seafor_c4,AskWomen,1391124076.0,"The philosophy isn't inherently misogynistic. You don't have the basic tenet correct. The basic tenet is that men and women are different. They want different things, feel differently, and act differently. Equality is a myth. For example, women, in general, are better care givers, men tend to be physically stronger etc. 

So room at the top? Top of what exactly? 

TRP goes on to talk about what women want in a sexual partner explaining what is professed on this sub all the time, ""Don't put women on a pedestal."" TRP says to be an ""alpha male"" (stupid vernacular) to sexually attract a woman, which isn't exactly rocket science. What ""being alpha"" means is hotly debated on the sub itself, but the basic behind ""alpha"" is demand to be respected.  Most women don't want to date a pushover. 

I see a lot of guys on/from TRP using the philosophy to be misogynistic sure but the basics aren't.

This is written communication. Half of a message's content is tone of voice, which does not exist here. Sometimes you pretty much have to use emoticons in order to have your point not be misunderstood. So many times I've seen to people who actually agree with each other have internet arguments because they don't realise *how* the other one means what they're saying."
fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391124083.0,"&gt; What do you mean, specifically, by this? I took OP as saying something along the lines of ""subscribing wholesale to any one ideology is a bad thing"" - and I agree with that. I see ideologues as people who try to cram the world through their own lens and that isn't going to lead to any kind of truth, imo. Rejecting lenses (also: admitting that pure objectivity is not a characteristic of any human being - being aware that we all have lenses is part of it) is a good thing, no?

An ideology is just a discrete sets of ideas (maybe a continuum, I don't actually know). While there's an infinite number of these ""sets"", a small number of sets are already named and packaged for consumption. E.g. Feminist Ideology, Communist Ideology, Libertarian Ideology, etc.

Set A might only have {a, b, c}, and set B might have {b, c, d}.

Someone could adopt set A entirely or set B entirely. They could also take pieces (ideas) from each and form his own ""Unique Ideology"" C {a, c, d}.

In this context, I personally don't care if one individual chooses to *""subscribe wholesale to any one ideology""*, because *everyone* will subscribe ""wholesale"" to an ideology. Even the null set {} (with no ideas) is a set.

My point is that the ideas within those sets are not a matter of choice for a lot of people.

I could believe a and b, and form an ideology out of that like {a, b} or more, but it's not always a conscious decision to switch ideas on and off.

People can yell at me until their faces turn blue that there is no ""good"" or ""right"" and that morality is relative, but many beliefs are beyond the realm of science or logic so I'd keep believing that there's an absolute standard (I don't know it, obviously). 

I know a lot of my thoughts and ideas weren't a matter of choice for me. The same is true for many others. I mostly try to judge by their actions, because people can act in complete contradiction to how they think, and yes this way of thinking does bring about a lot of moral dilemmas."

keakealani,singing,1391124424.0,"Absolutely. As /u/Etceterist mentions, puberty affects voices of both sexes and if you aren't conscientious of training your voice and ear through the transition, it's entirely possible to lose pitch accuracy amongst other things. 

There are two problems at play with this. One is simply the aural problem - you need to be able to hear a pitch accurately, retain it mentally, and repeat it back. That's the basic process of pitch matching and while I don't think you can completely ""lose"" that skill, it's absolutely possible to go out of practice and be less strong at pitch matching than you may have been previously. 

For this issue, I think the best idea is to work on standard aural training - things like hearing a melody and either writing it down or singing it back (or both), and being able to see a melody and sing it back (not as important if you're not interesting in reading music, but it can really help you mentally process music and repeat it back more accurately). 

The other issue is the vocal one. A LOT of girls, when going through their voice change, deal with some big changes in registration and vocal production. While female voices don't change as dramatically in terms of range (although some range changes do occur), the sound that is produced, and how it is produced, can change a lot over the course of puberty and vocal maturation (which can last all the way through your twenties, even if other aspects of puberty have long since finished). 

One of the big changes I've anecdotally noticed (having worked with a lot of adolescent girls' voices) is in accessing the higher part of the register. It actually takes quite a bit of air to sing in that higher voice, and because it's not the part of the register used for normal speaking, it's ordinarily quite weak. (This is worsened by the fact that most popular music styles focus on that speaking range as well, which discourages girls from exploring that higher range when singing music they like.) 

There's not really one easy trick for getting access to those higher notes, but I think that can do a lot to cure that ""monotone"" effect you're talking about, since I think that monotone feeling is related to the inability to access the majority of the range, which is above normal speaking pitch. Some possible ideas/exercises include sliding ""sirens"" or sighs, where you gently move your voice upwards focusing less on discrete pitch and more on relaxing and exploring the whole range. You can also try imitating a higher pitched voice (classic examples include TV chef Julia Child and the character Mrs. Doubtfire, although at this point we're going to need to come up with something more relevant for today's teens, haha.) 

I think if you're able to sing more with the whole range, you'll find that matching pitch becomes a lot easier - but it's difficult to match pitch when you haven't developed the muscle coordination and practice to even produce those pitches in the first place."

FactualPedanticReply,AdviceAnimals,1391124520.0,"You're missing part of the point of graffiti if you think about it like this. Graffiti is socially (and often legally) transgressive by its very nature. Scrawling your name on a place that you have no right to do so is a transgressive way of recording your existence and self-expression. Graffiti artists will usually have a repertoire of tags and pieces of varying complexity defined by how much unobserved time they have to establish the piece before they're caught by authorities or property owners. The ""vandalism"" element is part and parcel to the history and culture of the art - if it's not in there, you're just talking about a mixed-media mural. 

The way society treats this illegal art is a telling social commentary, too. Painting over it or covering it up can send any number of messages in the social dialogue: ""Your presence is unwanted,"" ""your art has no value,"" ""your art is not pleasing,"" ""the appearance of this place is not yours to dictate,"" etc. Leaving the art says other things. Periodically wiping out art says other things again.

At the end of the day, it's not for you to say what's art and what's not. Art is a vehicle for self-expression and examination of the human condition, and even the crudest pseudo-territorial bullshit fits that mold. Maybe ""En Fuego"" wanted to make you uncomfortably recognize that, as a human, you have a primitive element that longs to leave a mark, too. Maybe it was less thoughtful, and was merely their own impulse that drove them to leave a mark on the world.

Most people don't realise my name is supposed to be much longer, usually only those who are familiar with Welsh names  For a long time, my brother insisted on being called by the name of his favourite cartoon character, and now he likes to be called Sheldon (he frigging loves Big Bang Theory). He's never been able to call people by name, just 'him' or 'her' or 'that guy'.

Steve2982,architecture,1391124691.0,"I've read lots of resumes and cover letters, I used to prescreen applicants for internships and junior positions. 

For me, the cover letters that stood out are those where the applicant recognized that they're hoping to join my firm, even if just for the summer, and that they ought to be bringing something to the table. Right near the top of the cover letter needs to be something like this, ""I have a diverse set of skills that I can use to be a productive member of your staff"". Tell me about those skills, what can you do for me? Name some actual tasks in an office that you can do without supervision. Presentation plans? Perspectives? Can you draft details? Graphic design?

First, I'm worried that you have no useful skills. What am I going to do with you all summer? Second, I'm worried that in order to keep you productive, my staff will have to spend so much time with you that you end up costing me money.

Sorry, if this sounds harsh, this is the way it is. So many cover letters go on and on about the classes they took or what their thesis was, that's nice. But, you aren't applying for grad school, you're applying for a job.

Once I get the sense that you can actually be useful in the office, I'll keep reading. Next I want to know that you'll fit in, that your personality will gel with everyone else. Yes, I'm judging you. I'm going to have to make small talk with you at the coffee machine, do they seem like someone who will get my jokes. If you turn out to be a conceited ass, no one will want to work with you and then you become my problem again. What does this mean for your cover letter? Try to make yourself seem likeable, tell me about some quirky project you did that was only tangentially related to architecture. 

If you sound somewhat interesting, here's where I flip the page and look at your resume.

&gt;I'm having a hard time striking a balance between brevity and filling in the gaps of the story of myself that my portfolio and resume don't cover. 

I wouldn't worry too much about brevity. Unless I already like you, I'm going to be skimming anyway. Make sure if I only read the first sentence of each paragraph, that I still get all the important stuff.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""filling in the gaps of the story of myself."" If you're still in college, I'm not really expecting a solid gapless work history. Best case, you've worked in a firm before (see above). Mostly, I'm happy if you've held down a job, maybe done something interesting.

Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that what you hope to get out of an internship isn't important, just that the timing is important. You've got to cover the other bases first, get your ass in the door, save the other stuff for the interview.

Hope that helps."

Or in concrete terms:  It's not clear that it's a problem that teachers are paid less than lawyers.  And it's not clear that it's a problem that women are disproportionately likely to become teachers.  But both of these are true, and are major factors in the significant pay gap which does exist.  OP is basically saying ""if you ignore all the things that cause the gap, the gap doesn't exist"".  I think that's questionable.  You're saying ""the gap is fine"", which is very different.

TL;DR: OP is in the position of someone saying that inequality doesn't exist, because if you adjust for career, people flipping burgers and investment bankers make the same salary.  We can point out that this is stupid without arguing for a law to *make* them earn the same salary.  :)"

That changed and I started bullying others who were completely when I got to high school being that I was a strong kid and had anger issues. I realized later in my high school career what I was headed towards and stopped.

I ended up apologizing to the people I bullied for the most part, friends included who stuck with me through that turbulent time.

For you OP here's my failing, I had a chance at great success, to be a big shot. I gave it up to stay with a girl who was too co-dependent to do long distance. We ended up breaking up and I lost my shot. I worked dead end jobs for a few years and even was a bum for a year. I returned to school recently.

It's like.. If cutting were alcoholism, I've only had a beer, but with the impending storm, it's like.. a gallon of vodka is sitting in my fridge. That's a good analogy as to how I feel. 

My favourite places to cut were my thighs and my legs in my past, but that femoral artery scares me, and I think there's one [or a vein?] that runs down near your ankle that I'm also a little worried about. Nerve damage something that also really scares me. I'm not super worried about skin damage as I already have scars, and eczema and psoriasis, so my skin has never and likely will never be as important to me as it is to others. Infections, however, are not good. 

Doing my best to be safe, but just want to curl up in a little ball and cry. I was crying in Walmart when I went go buy the box cutter - it wasn't like an impulse; it was a conscious decision. It wasn't like the past where it was, ""I'm so mad, so I'm gonna smash this light bulb, and cut the shit out of myself with it,"" it was, ""I am consciously going to go walk to Walmart spend $14 that I don't have on a box cutter, then walk home, and then cut the shit out of myself."""

I don't love American patriotic music in general, but if I had to pick, I'd rather hear America the Beautiful any day. 

Okay, in terms of actual solo rep, though, I really think half of the stuff in the 24. I recommend it all the time and it's great for beginners, but I think a lot of it has overstayed its welcome in my brain. It's funny that I mention this, because I'm strongly thinking of bringing my 24 back out for something other than teaching, in order to learn Baroque ornamentation. But, a little part of me dreads singing any of them again, even the ones I never sang as a beginner. Haha.

The next thing I know he grabs me by my hood swings me around against the lockers I punch him in the face then shove him hard into the lockers before punching him again then it got broken up.

When she responded with anger and callousness, my panic attack escalated even worse.

Because it was my forgiveness that made me weak.

Because while I do want her to suffer, I want her to suffer for making the mistake she did, not because I hate her. To be embarassingly honest, I find myself to be such a good person that I want her to regret what she has done for the rest of her life. I want her to be lonely for acting on her sexual urges, thus abandoning the only person that ever cared about her. I want her to think of what she did as the single greatest mistake of her life, both now and in the distant future.  
  
I know how destrutive this is. It has already been destructive because it made me break my final promise. How do I just not care about what she might think of me, and just move on with my life?"

______
**FIGHT ONE**

So, I'm in high school. At the time, I spent half of my school day at this alternative high school for vocational training (we called it votech). So I'd be in normal high school, than after half the day get bussed to votech, do a single class for the rest of the day there, and then get bussed back to my regular school. Pretty sweet huh?

Anyways, this particular story starts off on the ride back from votech. We're fucking around and having a paper ball fight.  Now this one dude Brendan, me and him weren't huge fans of each other. Not enemies really, just not super fond of one another. Anyways, he's got this cool plan right. He's gonna gather up like eight paper balls and throw them at me super close in the face all shotgun-style. So he does this James Bond shit, sneaks up behind me in my bus seat, and fails miserably when I preemptively block all the paper balls with a notebook (I saw him approaching and played it cool). He's a bit bummed but just returns to his seat.

Well I hold on to one of those balls. We get off the bus and I toss at him. Hit's him in the back of the head - should be no big deal right? Well apparently the section of his skull that I hit was right where his ego is located. I'm walking away with my buddy Brent when he starts running towards me with his fist balled up near his waist like he's going to throw some wild haymaker.

Now it's worth mentioning here that Brendan was on the wrestling team of our school. It's even more worth mentioning that I had spent the last decade studying Taekwondo and held four black belts.

So I notice him in the corner of my eye and decide, again, to play it cool. I keep walking. Right at the most opportune moment, I turn and plant a sidekick right into his chest. Between my fairly large stature, his momentum, and my heel in his chest, what happened was basically his chest stopped moving but his legs kept going. He's feet left the ground and he landed *flat* on his back with a thud.

Now, Brendan was hot-headed but he wasn't no idiot. He walked away after that. That was of course until he realized **every fucking person on our votech bus saw what happened** and was pointing and laughing. So he turns around, walks up to me, and does that whole shoulder-to-shoulder-walk-in-a-circle dance with me. I'm just staring at him, waiting to respond (I fight very defensively). He calls me a ""Taekwondo bitch"". After a few circles some people break us up (thankfully, because I really don't think either of us *wanted* to fight at that point in time).

We split, and headed off in different directions. Never got caught or in trouble. He did grab a bag of trash and dump it on my truck and spit on it before I got to it though. That was petty punk bullshit but whatever. He did also harass me when I was at work a few months later to let me know he started taking Judo classes or some such. Whatever. We asked one of the VPs (vice principal) that we were cool with if we could get a copy of the video from around that time, but alas the camera facing that area didn't have see wide enough to actually capture anything exciting.

**tl;dr** Planted my heel in this dude's chest and got called a Taekwondo bitch.

____


**FIGHT TWO**

I remember one time, male housemate of mine was mistreating his girlfriend (who was also our housemate). He was drunk and wouldn't leave her alone. I tried telling him to just let her sleep, alone, like she wanted, but he wouldn't have it, and it seriously took a lot of mental strength to not kick his ass right there. I mean it seriously felt like I was pushing against the weight of a small car holding back from this guy. Later in the night though he kicked a door down and that was too far. I grabbed him, his girl ran out of the house with another girl housemate of ours (college house btw). I didn't seriously injure him, I didn't kill him, just used violence to control a situation that needed to be controlled.

____

**FIGHT THREE**

This one isn't a great story but whatever. Myself and two housemates were on our front porch smoking. The two housemates I'll call Billy and Mindy (not real names). Billy and I had some minor aggression going back and forth over petty bullshit for some time now. This particular evening, we had all been drinking quite a bit. Billy said something to me that pissed me off, and I'm not proud of this because I really try to avoid name-calling, but I called him a bitch to his face. He immediately grabbed my throat and tried to choke me. I toss away my cigarette and wrestle with him for a bit, end up on top of him choking him for a second. I let go, he gets up and storms in the house. Mindy is like ""well that's fucking great now shit's going to be awkward"". Well Billy comes back outside and is stomping around the front yard with his butterfly knife. Now I don't fuck with knives, shit's more dangerous than a gun in close combat. When he comes stomping up the front porch I'm yelling at him ""Don't fucking come up here with that fucking knife"" but he doesn't stop, as soon as he's within arm reach I punch him three times fairly hard - once in the side of the head and then twice in the shoulder after he flinched (this was very instinctual). I still remember hearing Mindy gasp when it happened - this is the only time I have ever punched someone outside of the ring. He just stopped walking right then and was holding his head. I wish I could remember what happened immediately after that, we didn't fight any more or anything but we didn't just go right to bed either. We ended up apologizing in the morning to each other for losing our cool."

mkvgtired,worldnews,1391125118.0,"Its not always ""corruption"" per se. For instance Chicago sold its long term meter income to a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley.

He was eventually voted out and the tax was repealed (which goes to show there was real political pressure from voters). 

Chicago was in a bind and really could not raise taxes further without heads rolling so it did the next ""logical"" thing. It sold future revenues for *far* below their present value because it was rushed (finance undergrad, and I'm a loser and did the actual calculations). 

That said, I doubt any of the politicians significantly benefited personally with the exception of them being able to keep their jobs. People were pissed about this deal, but I guess the aldermen figured it was better than trying to raise taxes again. "

Kaisharga,AskMen,1391125186.0,"I do this too, though it's completely without intention. The kind of bond I have with my friend/former-coworker is leagues apart from the bond I have with my fiancee. I can talk to my friend about how my day went because he has the context to fully understand the nature of the job and the nuances of situations, plus he and I share interests in the form of skill- or strategy-based video games (among other things). He's the kind of person I can send links to stupid images from the internet. 

My fiancee, though, is a comfort in the physical warmness sense, the caring and kind sort of deal. She and I don't really share that many interests, and the ones we do share in name we don't really share in the parts that matter--I'm into jumpy shooty action games and she's more into what I call the ""Facebook genre,"" for instance. We share economic interests and some deeper emotional connection than I have with my friend, but the topics of conversation in those fields are fewer and not as small-talky.

If I've had a hard day, I want to bullshit. I don't want to talk about the thing that pissed me off and revisit that sensation; I want to do something that's fun and get over the psychochemical mire that's got me in ""upset"" mode, and replace it with joviality and amusement. Resolution is unnecessary when supplantation is effective *and* yields a better mood in the end. 

What I'm saying here is that comfort comes in several types, but the key here is context. Your kind of comfort is better for certain things, and his friend's comfort is better for others, and the two aren't really comparable (i.e., you can't say ""he's better in comforting""). And only he can really tell what kind of comfort he needs at any moment. He needs your comforts, too!

Just remember it's not a competition to see who can be the most supportive and welcoming. The main thing is to *be* supportive and welcoming, and give him the freedom to seek the sort of comfort he needs.

I'm able to lose myself in the moment and actually enjoy myself instead of being dead focused on treading the line between orgasm and making sure she gets hers. 


I just forget. I forget to worry about it at all. And because of that, it becomes a non-issue and we both just very thoroughly enjoy ourselves. So really, not only do I enjoy it more, I feel like I'm a better, more attentive and giving lover as well. "

Vintage typically refers to quality of source, not age, even though it literally means ""vine age"".

Some years are just better than others, for example 1998 was renowned for good Australian Shiraz.

Just because it was a city when AP was formed does not mean that all the development was already present in the early 50s. Most of Hyd's income comes from industries like IT, Pharma etc. which weren't present when the state was formed. So it is disingenuous to claim that the rest of AP did not make any contributions to developing Hyderabad. 

People of coastal Andhra probably made the biggest contribution to state revenue during the initial years(50-80) as they had the best(and still do) agricultural infrastructure at that time. Regardless of who made what contributions, everyone agreed to spending the combined state funds on development of Hyderabad because they thought it was their capital too. 

I see why sharing the capital might become difficult as it is completely enclosed in Telangana. However saying that the rest of the state does not have any claim to Hyderabad is incorrect and selfish. I feel especially sorry about the people of Rayalaseema who will have neither the infrastructure of the Coastal districts nor the opportunities of Hyderabad after the division."

The mod's author said that he loved how I did the character but there was a lot of hate spewed about Joto from players, and no room in my schedule when he asked me to do additional lines for the dog quest so I ended up being replaced. I also voiced Shadrick Oakenheart, but he's only available if you go with the imperial option.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but you don't get asked ""what are you?"" or ""where are you from?"" the way we do. If you do get asked I assume it's always just to know the town or county? It's a way to identify yourself.  

A typical conversation for american's starts with ""where are you from?"" (answer: town or state), then followed by ""what are you?"" (Irish, Italian, etc.) especially if it's obvious your looks point to a different heritage or else this often comes up after a few minutes of talking. So for most of us, being identified by our heritage is a huge part of life. We can't answer that question with ""I'm American."" One, it would get us weird looks. Two, there would most certainly be a follow-up to find out what our heritage is. 

Most people don't refer to themselves here as Irish-American or Polish-American. We're just Irish or Polish. It's assumed that you're American, unless you have an accent and then you'd probably get your own follow up question of ""are you from such and such country?"" if you were to visit here. Part of our identity is being Irish, but American-Irish. We just don't say it that way. 

I'm sure when most tourists that visit Ireland when asked will respond with ""I'm Irish."" It becomes more reactionary than anything else. I apologize for people that do that when they visit. When I go over and someone asks me in any foreign country I say, ""I'm American"" and if I happen to be in Ireland and they want to probe a little more then sure, the Irish heritage comes up. Not as many people travel abroad from here anymore and the idea of not being Irish unless your from Ireland is not something that is going to come up.

That fact that americans need to identify with a heritage and ""own it"" is not something that will ever change. You can't just be American. It's too indistinct and broad. So much so that it has almost no meaning inside our own country other than patriotic. Almost any town with a decent population will have different cultural centers, whether you are in ""Little Italy"" in New York City or Los Angeles or the irish side of town. And in so many places in between you will find a ""Little Italy"" or Irish neighborhood, or Asiantown in somewhere like Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis.  But even the small towns or communities will have neighborhoods identified with a heritage. My own small town where I grew up had an Italian and Irish neighborhood and big festivals to celebrate that heritage every year. It's in everything that we are here.

Any time the discussion of family comes up, the question of heritage will follow.  Things typically go in this order when meeting new people, ""where are you from?,"" what are you (meaning heritage)?"" then,  ""what's your religion?""  Now they aren't always explicitly asked though often they are but also questions often get geared towards finding out all these answers.  These still carry a lot of meaning in our identification.

Look at it like this, I know what all of my immediate neighbors ethnicity is.  One German (-American), two African (-American), one English (-American), and one I think Polish (-American).  It's about the best I can explain it.  Saying I'm Irish doesn't mean the same thing even though we identify it the same way.  In our everyday interactions we run into so many many people of different heritages that identifying ourselves as that heritage has become part of the American culture."

I putz around the shoe department and pick up wads of that paper. Also duck into the stockroom for loooong periods of time because that dept. is pretty darn slow.

I'm brilliant at keeping myself busy when there is absolute fuck all to do.

I deal with crazy folks in general. (Some woman screamed at me for not sorting her bras by color and her gloves by the general age group/size. While we had a massive line. She told me over and over that it wasn't McDonalds and that I didn't need to rush. She then asked if I was a student and what I was studying.

mkvgtired,worldnews,1391125966.0,"&gt; Aside from crashing greece? 

They didnt ""crash Greece"". I'm not sure why people keep saying this. They ""hid"" [1.6% of Greece's debt](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/22/goldman-sachs-greece-derivatives-idUSLDE61L1KH20100222) through a completely legal cross currency swap. 

Before the emergence of the Euro, [seven of the world's 14 industrialized central banks](http://www.hrmars.com/admin/pics/43.pdf) used these transactions (and *many* emerging economies did, and still do). Of the seven central banks using them, six were European. 

If any central bank should have known to take these into consideration when calculating debt obligations, it should have been the ECB. 

Saying the ECB knew full well Greece didn't meet the requirements to join the Euro is far less popular than blaming its incompetence/willful ignorance on an evil American corporation, but it does not make that version the correct one.

EDIT: Much of the problem rests on European banks. Pre-crisis Europe's [largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) were only paying a small premium for Greek debt compared to German debt despite the widely varying credit risk. They were essentially betting on a government bailout if anything went wrong, and they got it. Much of the bailout money has not remained in the Greek economy, but has went to large European banks in the form of debt repayments. 

Lets not forget Greece itself. Its country was far to over-leveraged to join the Eurozone to begin with. But because, at the time, France and Germany were more concerned about quantity than quality all the major players knowingly looked the other way. Hell, even before the European Debt Crisis Greece's [head banker](http://www.bankofgreece.gr/BoGAttachments/14.2.2008%20Economist%20EN.doc) essentially told the investing world Greek debt was a bad long term investment, yet European banks liked making extra income on their ""risk free"" Euro denominated debt holdings. These European banks made the right call though, they were indirectly bailed out by taxpayers for their bad investments. This continues with every debt repayment by Greece using taxpayer funds. It is absurd how many times I have seen the Greek crisis blamed on GS all while ignoring more culpable actors. 

**TL;DR: If Goldman caused the Greece crisis, spoons made Rosie O'Donnell fat.**"

If you look for people who have specific tastes, then you can miss finding the people who can relate to you in a broader sense. 

An ideal relationship is someone who complements you--someone who is similar to you in some respects and dissimilar in others. You probably want someone who enjoys movies for the same reasons you do, but not necessarily the same movies. I think it would be boring to always agree on those things. I think it's more important to find someone with whom you can have a lively conversation about what you liked and disliked in a movie. You can disagree but still think enough the same that you can learn from each other. 

You talk about fundamental differences that popped up a few months into your previous relationships...do you think those differences are attributable to your different tastes in movies and music? "

My blind picks

- [Bohnanza](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-uVeuEtozM) - it's a game playing a bean farmer. it's goofy, it's fun. it's a lot of trading back and forth. it's very engaging without stressing people out
- Shadow Hunters - great party game. It's about social deduction, finding out who is on your team based on what they do. There are a lot of games that do this. this is one of the easier ones to learn
- [Anomia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwCvFS1wg0I) - a blast to play; easy to learn, VERY tense in a fun way with lots of random yelling
- [Word ARound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_PhEGNxzwo) - an easy to learn word game, silent and then Eureka moments. It's tense but not as bursty as Anomia
- [Snake Oil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7twmIeI2y0) - You may have heard of Cards Against Humanity. Don't buy that game. Instead play Snake Oil. It's a light easy game that you can play.
- [Dixit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6UlbxeDE0w) - if you don't mind looking at paintings instead of words. Pick Dixit instead of Snake Oil
- [Say Anything](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7BsVb-5wDs) - a trivia game with infinite questions that can be as personal as you like. good for people you know
- [Wits and Wagers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9M_vEaj3qM) - trivia game with just numbers, easy to guess. good for people you don't know

====
in terms of long term replay value.. W&amp;W in theory could get memorizy, as well as Word ARound those aren't the games you'd want to make your afternoon daily game. But the rest could actually work as your daily game. Dixit might get old but then you have expansions you can buy which will completely revitalize your experience."

turtlehana,loseit,1391126118.0,"1700 net calories a day to ensure your body is getting everything it needs. In the beginning you'll lose water weight then you should balance out to 1-2lbs a week. If you are going to eat less than that I strongly advise you seek medical advice and have a doctor checking your progress along the way. 

I say net calories because if you are going to do extreme exercising and/or weight lifting you should eat back those calories (imo) and even in some cases increase your net calories because you will burn more, perhaps calculate your [TDEE](http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm). (For example: If you are 22, male 215lbs, 5'10, and exercise 5x a week your TDEE is approximately 2900 so... 1700 calories-2900 TDEE = -1200. A deficit of 1200 calories a day or 8400 calories a week. A 3500 calorie deficit a week will get you at approximately -1lb a week so this will put you at more than double that and I wouldn't advise you go lower with out medical supervision. Keep in mind weight loss is not linear and it will vary). 

No supplements unless you occasionally have a protein shake. There is no magic pill to weight loss. Additionally it isn't safe to shed a lot of weight quickly, it is better to slowly lose and in doing so you are keeping your body healthy and learning good habits (you also don't want to risk loose skin). 

By healthy I mean you are getting all the vitamins and minerals you need from your food and are not depriving your body of what it needs to function. Starving yourself is not healthy neither is eating poorly.

------

*If you* ***aren't looking for permanent results*** *and only want something temporary check out /r/juicing. However you* ***will gain it all back quickly if you decide to stop*** *(Fat Sick and Nearly Dead). My husband lost 30lbs in 6 weeks and I lost 15lbs in 6 weeks, as soon as we stopped (and our friend stopped) we gained it back in less than a month I think because we didn't learn healthy eating habits though we were eating better than we had been prior. My husband said nothing was good, he was always hungry and tired, and you just as well starve yourself. Additionally I thought it was boring to not eat, I also thought it was disgusting, and I would actually rather starve than have only liquid meals.*"

Furthermore, TRP ideology is misogynistic; misogyny and more generally, patriarchy, has/have been harming and oppressing women (*all* women, including trans women) since the friggin' dawn of civilization, whereas feminist theory has arisen more recently (as far as the grand scheme of things goes) to finally try and fight patriarchy and misogyny. Finally, as I said in another comment, TRP ideology and radical feminist theory are almost *literally* the antitheses of one another, therefore I really don't think they can be compared at all.

At any rate, the available science we have shows that two parent households, with a married mother and father, generally result in the best outcomes.

Did you miss that part?  Sure, I guess if you selectively ignore half of what I said then it's easier to argue against, but I don't understand why you would do that.

Shimp's actions were not the cause of McFall's dependent health condition.  If Shimp had caused McFall's condition, and McFall had died, Shimp would have committed a cut and dry act of negligent homicide.  Refusing to donate blood is not negligence, but putting him in such a condition he needs blood donations to live is.

Unlike McFall v. Shimp, a mother's actions *are* the cause of their child's dependent health condition.  Refusing to take care of the child is not negligent, but putting the child in such a condition that he needs that care to live is.

You have every right to bodily autonomy.  You have no right to put others in the situations where they are dependent on your body to live.  Doing so, and then withdrawing consent causing them to die constitutes negligent homicide, despite the fact that you have the right to withdraw consent."

The British version was a lot more genuine. He actually tried to help out the owners. He actually tried to teach them important lessons in running a business. He didn't hand them aid on a fucken silver platter. ""Take this new oven. Just let me spend a few hundred grand to renovate this shop. Here, take this new menu that I made up because you're too shitty to come up with a decent one."" There were no outrageous advertisement or editing to develop a fake persona that would make the viewers continue watching it.

The American version is great entertainment. It really is. I've seen both and I honestly have to say that the American one is a lot more fun to watch. I just dislike it because it's so fake. For that reason alone I like the British one more. There's less action, there's less cursing, but you actually get to see Ramsey trying to help people instead of just yelling at them. You see Ramsey actually connecting with people and caring about them but he's not going to go out of his way to make their life better because that's their job."

TheCarpetPissers,worldnews,1391126416.0,"1) Be careful who you call an ""Israel firster"".  I am a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

2)I am not advocating for settlements.  I explicitly stated that I am merely pointing out a flawed analogy.  As a matter of fact, I think Israel should begin dismantling all of the ""outposts"" and any settlement it does not reasonably expect to maintain in an agreement with the Palestinians.  However, I live safely in America.  It's not up to me to tell them what to do.  I respect their democracy and believe the government to be acting in -what it at least believes- to be the best interest of its people.

3)I'm not entirely sure the 4th Geneva Convention applies to the settlements.  Article 49 states, ""The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies"".  That leads you to the question about settlers, obviously.  Now, Israel has never ""deported"" nor ""transferred"" any of its population to the West Bank.  WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT ABOUT ALL THE SETTLERS?!?!?!  Well, ""deport"" and ""transfer"" both imply some degree of force.  Nobody ""deported"" or ""transferred"" me from Alabama to California.  I came of my own accord.  So did the settlers.  Now, you could argue that the inducements offered (lower taxes, etc) amount to a ""transfer"", but the matter is not 100% decided.

4) Regardless of why King Hussein relinquished claim, he relinquished his claim.  The question of ""why"" is purely an academic matter and has little to no bearing on the discussion - in my opinion.  Being that there was no sovereign power to transfer the land to (as you stated, ""with the aim of helping the Palestinian people establishing their own independent state"") the territory moves from being ""occupied"" to being ""disputed"".  You can't ""occupy"" land that doesn't belong to another country.  That just doesn't make sense.  Does that justify Israel building all those hilltop settlements? Not in my mind.  Not even a little bit. However, I think the term ""occupied territories"" should be replaced with ""disputed territories"".  It just seems much more accurate."

LordXerces,relationships,1391126462.0,"I'm a man, and this reminds me so much of myself. I just got out of a three year long relationship, and the breakup is the ugliest, most violent thing I have experienced.  
  
The first year we were together, she was **exactly** like your girlfriend. Then, for the two last remaining years, I became just like her, and she started feeling the exact feelings you're having now. She ended up cheating on me because of how depedent I was. It's not justifiable, and she's a terrible person, but it was a factor. It's not really relevant, but I want you to know that I speak from experience, and that this needs to be solved as fast as possible if you truly want it to work.  
  
""The one who loves the least controls the relationship"" is a tragic, but omnipotent truth. In a relationship there is such a thing as power, and the more you distance yourself, and the more clingy she will become. Imagine if she just suddenly went cold on you? And she kept being cold? Then you would suddenly be the one who became clingy and depedent.  
  
Then, there is another solution, and this one is ... Well. It's sacrificial. After a while into my 3 year relationship, I became choked with how depedant she was. Then we broke up, and got back together. The thing that kept me with her, was that I no longer cared about her dependency. I didn't care that she didn't challenge me, or that I found her outright boring. I stayed with her because taking care of her, giving her all the love she ever wanted and needed made me so happy in return. I found happiness in her happiness, and in her never-ending admiration and love for me. I came to appreciate her as a human being, not as someone who I wanted something from. I sacrificed my needs for a challenge for unconditional love.  
  
The latter solution is radical, and in the end, as mentioned, that fucked everything up, as it ended her dependency and initiated mine. But considering how fucking beautiful that was, when I was her everything I had and I gave myself to her selflessly in return, it's not something I would discourage. It just needs to happen with the right person. And the person I was with was not right."

When behind Trundle building damage to 'counter' his ultimate screams 'clueless smartass who thinks he knows his shit'. Why? Because Trundle will still all in you @6 with ignite and ult. Giving up on defense means his ult heals for more (combined with W it heals even more), defense shred makes you even weaker and then Q will fuck up any sheen powered auto attacks. And when laning is over he finishes BotRK/Hydra, has at least one full def item and continues to build defense and you are boned untill really late game comes.

  
So when you die to the Troll before level six and decide to go on offense - be his guest. With no help from jungler he will bully out any bruiser as soon as they come back to lane and try to go head to head with him. You are already behind which means Trundle dealt more damage. Then he pushes your lane, you lose even more gold and experience.  
You both come back to lane, but Trundle is already one level above you and responds to amp tome and mana crystal with bilgewater cutlass or tiamat, so he still has more damage, his Q @lvl 5-6 effectively gives him 45 AD over the other guy CONSTANTLY (15 taken from them and 30 from ability bonus, 4 sec cooldown and 8 sec duration) which equals to a fucking B.F. Sword.  
To sum it up - level 5 Malphite gets ulted. He has around 65 armor and 40 MRes (given standard runes, masteries and doran's shield start), around 1k HP and 73 AD. Trundle ults and bites. Suddenly this little rock has 58 AD, 900 health, 39 armor, 24 mres for 4 seconds (and gradually recovers the rest over next 4) and loses 200 hp over the course of ult. Meanwhile Trundle has around 120 AD, 1160 HP and another ~130 taken from Malphite (after lowered mres), about 86 armor and 58 mres. Fight him, that's why you built damage, right?


As seen in this game, Wickd yet again used his ultimate to escape more often than to engage because he tried to 'counter' Trundle's ultimate in most bronze-sque way possible.

So please, go on and build that damage."

DJ-Salinger,AskMen,1391126517.0,"Definitely *Because The Internet* by Childish Gambino.

[Link to great song from it](https://soundcloud.com/christianrich/childish-gambino-crawl-1)

If you listened to other stuff him him and didn't care for it, definitely give this a shot.  One great thing about him, is that he was almost immediately in the public light, so you really get to see him grow as an artist.  This album especially he's moved away from cheesy punchline rap and made something much more cohesive.

First off, this album is super ambitious.  It's got 20 tracks, which isn't a measure of quality, but is still pretty substantial.  In addition, he released a 75 page screenplay along side it written by him that follows along with the story the album tells.  Even more he released a short film and [a website](http://becausetheinter.net/) and an instagram for it.  Beyond that, he did a ton of the production for the tracks which is always awesome to see.

Beyond this, this album is crazy diverse.  The song after the one I linked, called WORLDSTAR, half about being an actor/writer/musician/comedian half about the website worldstarhipshop starts of as a fairly normal rap song, before breaking down into a collage of found sounds ripped from the site, which he incorporates into the actual music, finally the song migrates into this free-form trippy saxophone jazzfest.

There's a ton of other creative things that it took a few times to notice.  In the above listed WORLDSTAR, right before the found sound chants start, you can hear him say, ""Hold it horizontal!"" which is sort of making light about all the vertically filmed cell phone videos on the net.  One song starts off with the really subtle background noise of windshield wiperblades moving back and forth.  There's just a ton of layers here.

Well, that was a lot of words.."

They are saying it out of anger and frustration; furthermore, since in a parent-child relationship, the parent is the authority figure and stronger and more powerful than the child, so the child saying something like that or making those sorts of threats is almost laughable, because it's obvious that the parent has all the power in the relationship and could ground or otherwise punish the child, no matter how much the child ""hates"" the parent.

thebumm,todayilearned,1391126809.0,"The only way they do it now is through families. If there is a familial connection to Anne Frank, damn right they'll find it. They have to have records to go through with this system. They can't just go in and say any name. Records come from genealogy, from the living family members.



Yes, in the past they got records for all sorts of people. US Presidents and all that. I don't think it's even a bad thing. I can see how some would see it as rude, but if I just stand in my house, claim I started a religion of TMNT and every name I say from this point on is a member of my church, is that really rude? Crazy, maybe; silly, certainly; but rude? Nah.



And once again, effectiveness is only based on belief. If you believe in religion A and they bless you into religion B, you can tell God or Allah or Abraham or Buddha or whoever the hell you think is right anytime that you shun religion B. If you're Anne Frank and your spirit is still living and one of your living family members brings your name into a Mormon temple to bless it or baptize it, you can wave to God and say ""No way, God. That church is bullshit. I'm not Mormon.""



They don't baptize unwilling living people (like babies in other churches). The 'dead' they baptize don't go on any church records to up membership quotas, it just affords the dead the opportunity to [from the LDS perspective] accept Christ. And I would argue that even that is less the reason than allowing heartbroken living family members to be comforted by the idea that their persnickety grandfather finally had the chance to be in their family-oriented church because his earthly stubbornness no longer stood in the way of his eternal salvation.




Mormons have heaps of fucked up practices (as do all religions) but this is hardly one of them.

It may be a good idea to talk to him and let him know.  Just be honest with him.  Believe you me, as a guy with a pretty large, maybe overwhelming, sense of humor, I'd prefer someone be honest with me when I've gone too far, rather than hate me secretly.  Guys like us typically don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, but since we're always playing on the line, we're bound to stumble across it sometimes.  I will always apologize if I notice it, or if someone talks to me about it.  Plus, you don't want to resent him for this and let it build and build.  These are the sort of things that come out in your first ""big fight"" because you've unknowingly held a grudge the whole time.  This kind of stuff likes to eat at you in the background.

And since we're being honest on the interwebs, you also need to realize that you probably *aren't* as unique a snowflake as you may think you are.  I've had that exact same conversation with almost every girl I know, give or take the guy thing, as that depends on the girl.

JJEagleHawk,AskReddit,1391126862.0,"Waited a long time to tell this story, and not me (but my dad). 

The answer is: a heart attack.

It was 1997. I was 16 and the oldest of 3; my dad was 46. By his own admission, he LIKED smoking. Though he didn't like the stains on the white walls or his teeth, he enjoyed going outside and being alone to de-stress a few times a day. He was heading in to work one day and started feeling tingly, and short of breath on his walk in to the parking lot. He thought, ""I'm having a heart attack"", and briefly considered finishing the walk into the building so he could get to his office and call 911. ""Something"" told him not to, but to get back in his car and drive the half-mile to our family doctor's office. [yes, terrible idea]. He arrived at the receptionist's desk at the clinic and said ""I'm having a heart attack"", and passed out. He woke up in the hospital -- a different place than where he'd remembered arriving.

After stabilizing him, the doctors had put in a stent (via balloon catheterization) to hold open the 95% clogged artery. When the doctors found out he was a smoker, they advised him that if he quit smoking, immediately, today, his chances of another heart attack within 5 years was about 5%. If he had ONE cigarette, his chances of NOT having a heart attack in 5 years was about 10% (because, like Pringles, you can never have just one cigarette). These numbers may not be accurate but it's what I remember from nearly 17 years ago.

Dad described having a heart attack as ""an elephant sitting on your chest"", and when an elephant sits on your chest, ""it gets your attention quickly."" He quit cold turkey, and hasn't had a cigarette (or heart attack) since. I'm now 32, he's just turned 63, and me and my extant siblings . . . plus two more that have come along since . . . have all gotten a lot more years with him because he survived a heart attack that motivated him to stop smoking.

I hope you don't need similar motivation, but it would probably work if you survived it.

P.S., my mom didn't find any similar motivation, and smoked for another 15 years. She quit 2 years ago, using e-cigarettes, and is to 0mg now (but still uses the e-cig because she ""has to have something to do with her hands""). She sits in the living room and looks like that caterpillar from Alice in Wonderland."

Jourdin,AskWomen,1391127180.0,"Sure, there are plenty of books written on the theories and ideologies of radical feminism. Believe it or not, it's not just the creation of ""man-hating"" tumblr bloggers; I think they have just popularized it and helped propagate the negative stereotypes regarding radical feminists.

My sociology textbook briefly defines radical feminism (or rather, feminist theory) when outlining the timeline of the development of different sociological theories. Feminist Theory stems from Conflict Theory, which is also known as neo-Marxism (which, sadly, ""Marxism"" is a somewhat semantically negatively-charged word). To quote the text:

&gt; Other modern perspectives have taken conflict theory's insights on economic inequality and adapted them to the study of contemporary inequalities of race, gender, and sexuality. [...] Feminist theory developed alongside the twentieth-century women's rights movement. By applying assumptions about gender inequality to various social institutions - the family, education, the economy, or mass media - feminist theory allows for a new way of understanding those intitutions and the changing role of gender in contemporary society. Theorists such as Judith Butler (1999), bell hooks (2003), and Catharine MacKinnon (2005) link gender with inequality in other social hierarches - race and ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation - and argue that gender and power are inextricably intertwined in our society. -- [The Real World, 3rd Edition, Ferris &amp; Stein 2012](http://www.amazon.com/The-Real-World-Introduction-Sociology/dp/0393912175/)

So, I suppose to answer your question more briefly, it's not as if there's a Radical Feminist Bible or anything like that, at least not that I know of. It's made up of many different tenets, and generally there are separate works discussing each. If you're interested, a good place to start would be to look for works by the three theorists mentioned in the textbook. It's really hard to define movements concisely. You could ask the same thing about queer theory (what does it stand for and where is the documentation), and get a similar answer; there is no one text that says it all. It's made up of many different ideas, put forth by as many different people, that are accepted as the truths of the movement.

Edit: I'd also like to add that something else that is unfortunate is that ""radical feminism"" has turned into a bad word. Yes it is radical compared to liberal/sex-positive feminism and queer theory, but it is not radical or extreme in the way that, like, cults are radical and extreme. Radfem theory is better thought of as ""original"" feminism, or what people thought of feminism as during the '70s or during the suffrage movement. It involves revolution, and the dismantling of the current power structure of society, and those ideas scare a lot of people, and I think that paired with tumblr-ers' &amp; other bloggers' representation of radical feminism sheds a really bad light on the whole thing."

I was actually on Prozac before for a few months and changed meds because it wasn't helping my depression. I did notice though after about two months that my OCD symptoms were better than I expected them to be, and then once I stopped taking it they went back to normal. So this time I'm back on Prozac along with another anti-depressant (Wellbutrin, which worked pretty quickly) and hoping it will help with the OCD again. I have heard that it takes longer and requires higher doses when used for anxiety, but people have gotten great results with it.

It is true that when creating in online game, it is best to start with the networking code and THEN build a game on that platform. However, it is not true that the correct place to start when learning to make an online game is to write a networking platform.

To learn to make this game, you should start with a much, much simpler game. Here's an example (it's not the only path!):

First, write Hangman. Then, write Tic-Tac-Toe. Then, write Pacman. Then, a sprite-based platformer. Finally, write a single-player fighting game.

Once you've done all that, you can start to learn to write the net code for your fighting game! You will start from scratch between each game, and do a much better job each time.

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391127413.0,"Some of it. LOTR and the Silmarillion cover most of it (especially if you include the Appendices). The Hobbit is all-but-useless for lore, as it's generally accepted that the narrator (Bilbo) exaggerated and made comic references for effect, and Tolkien didn't do a terribly good job of integrating it with Middle-earth. Tolkien's Letters are hugely revealing, as well. The real treasure trove is the History of Middle Earth, a massive undertaking that lays out the history of the *writing* of Middle Earth. So, it gives you very very early versions of Tolkien's work, along with commentary by Christopher (his son and literary executor) about what his dad was thinking, cross-referencing in the letters and the like. It's basically the same stories, told a dozen or so times, with Christopher telling you what changed and why. It's amazing. I've only just started, but... yeah. Amazing."

porpoiseoflife,worldbuilding,1391127634.0,"Of course, you could just skip out on sending messages via hyperspace.

Instead use a system of buckyballs that are entangled on a quantum level. (Yes. I know something like this has been done. But so has hyperspace.) I don't have the math for a full explanation, but here it is in a nutshell. 

When you entangle two atoms, you essentially make them behave the exact same way all the time. So what affects one will automatically affect the other. Alter the spin of one? The spin of the other is altered in the same way. The real trick of this is that the effects of quantum entanglement are not diminished by distance nor is there a significant time loss. So if one is sent off to the other side of the galaxy via hyperspace, it can still affect and be affected by the other member of the pair back home on a real-time basis.

Quantum entanglement sounds like something out of speculative fiction, but it is very much a current-day set of experiments. See [le wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement) for further information."

redditulous1,AskReddit,1391127696.0,"I smoked 20-30 a day for 6 years. My answer is the right motivation. I tried giving up with patches, then other forms of nicotine replacement therapy, and resorted back to smoking every time ( about 4 failed attempts in total). Then one day, I was walking up the stairs to my apartment and my heart went crazy and I was out of breath and felt really weird. Immediately after that, I craved a cigarette. From that moment, I went cold turkey and haven't touched one since. I truly believe quitting nicotine is a mental battle. 

Nicotine replacement therapy is not quitting, it's marginally better than smoking, but you're still addicted to the substance. I know many a person that still use nicotine replacement therapy years later and can't stop. If you really want to stop, and are determined to, then you'll do it.

Another point is treating it as a proper addiction. You will always be a nicotine addict, and so can't touch cigarettes again or you will relapse."

Very triggering was the philanthropy experiment, I'd get responses to my ad that were sort of heartbreaking, and I couldn't help everyone or many of the problems that people described. I imagine politicians and lawmakers must get the same sob-stories. 

Oh! I was also in the Navy for awhile, and got kicked out after 3 months in my ""A"" school that would've taken about 2 years to complete. I was bored out of my mind and couldn't deal with all the bullshit being in the military entails, at least at that stage of the military career. I became a tramp/drifter after that and that was also a relaxing time in my life.


All-in-all I'd say us borderlines are just cut out to be explorers in the great ocean that is the American workplace. I still fantasize of one day maybe working as a cook on a cruiseship, or maybe somehow tramp around on freighters. Having many different jobs in different fields really widens your perspective. I appreciate soldiers more now, but not for the usual reasons most people have. And people in government also get a bad rep, especially when they're responsible for the fates of many people. Working in restaurants you also empathize with the small-business owners and their troubles, to say nothing of people who have no other choice (i.e. education) to work anywhere else than a dive bar. Working at a motel you also see people at their lowest points, like prostitutes and people who live at the location.



At the diner my mind is either in a continual daydream or I flirt with all the young (around my age), but married/taken waitresses, it's a fun game, it's so safe and wholesome. Working at a bar was nice too, everyone else you work with is also crazy, but probably too much drama for a person like you.  "

constituent,chicago,1391127823.0,"Fourthed.  I've been going here for a few years and appreciate the regular banter.  Customers may choose a barber they prefer, or first-available.

The added bonus is a cleanup with a straight razor to the neck and the gentlemen will even clean up your ears or brows.  

I've always had a high regard for barber shops, thanks to those monthly dad/son visits for a haircut.  This place has the same nostalgia of hardwood floors, magazines sprawled about, a vintage-yet-modern appearance, and the idle chitchat to fill the atmosphere.

However, I also want people to be able to control the appearance of things they have ""rightful ownership"" of, so I support punishing vandals in general.

The thing I find irresistibly interesting about the social phenomenon is how fickle society is about the merit of this art. If a piece has certain qualities or expressiveness, it's illicit nature is overridden to the point that, sometimes, the owner of the site elects to allow it to remain and the vandals go unpunished.

tehsuigi,toronto,1391128067.0,"&gt;Nope.  The purpose of the line is to reduce congestion at Bloor and south of Bloor.  It is to align with the cities policies of increasing downtown office and residential intensification over the next twenty years.

Only if it doesn't go north of Eglinton. To be honest, the best DRL/Commuter Line proposals start at Eglinton/Don Mills and head south to cross Danforth. That way, it provides additional north-south capacity east of Yonge between Bloor-Danforth and the Eglinton Crosstown lines, relieving what will be the *next* stupid-busy interchange.

Densification may be happening downtown, but I'm not sure if you have the causality right.

&gt;The name change is purely political, you're right about that.  But, otherwise, no. 
And purely political because of the downtown vs suburb schism that Mayor Ford and others continue to propagate.

For once Rah, you don't deserve the down votes on this issue.

Typical defense of an insecure gamer/programmer/manager/teacher/helpdesk person/brother/sister/husband/wife/...

Someone is complaining about something, to which you are related in some far-fetched way?
Insult them and say they're trying to pin it on other people.

It looks a lot like the ""fallacy fallacy"": https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy

It's the classic ""he said something I don't like, therefor he must be stupid"" argument. This time in the form of saying this person is not recognizing their own failures and trying to blame others.


It's an unjust acquisition, based on your prejudice.

The subject is this game, where 5 people play versus 5 people. To not talk about failures of the other teammates is to refuse the existence of such failures. And on top of that, you accuse this person of trying to shift the blame to these now-blameless entities. As if it's some sort of crime to suggest other people than the person complaining made mistakes.

thro_way,TumblrInAction,1391128412.0,"&gt;You are aware that people sometimes have sex without the intention of making a baby, right? That there are even precautions one can take to prevent this?

Intent is never a factor in determining liability.  For the same reason that drunk driving without the intention to put someone in a dependent health condition doesn't absolve you of liability in the event that it happens, having sex without the intention to put someone in a dependent health condition does not absolve you of liability in the event that it happens.

By any medical or scientific definition, fetuses are both alive and human.  Ultimately the issue boils down to your philosophical/spiritual definition of a person.  And for those who believe that fetuses are people, the idea that a fetus' right to life supersedes a mother's right to bodily autonomy is a tenable one that aligns completely with the well established legal concepts of liability and proximate cause.  The violinist analogy certainly does nothing to refute it, which is the only assertion I'm making.

By the way, you seem to have a tremendous misunderstanding of when the concept of a ""burden of proof"" applies that really doesn't lend itself to general discussion.  The idea is more of a legal concept; in general discussion, either party can be framed as making an assertion that must be defended.  Or to put this another way, I'm sorry, you're the one making the assertion that an embryo is not a person, so the burden of proof is on you."

Ajaxeler,TwoXChromosomes,1391128446.0,"My mother went through hell with my father and I asked her for advice as I recently went through something similar to you where a close friend of mine confided that he was falling in love with another woman. He is married with a kid. 

I wanted to tell his partner there was another woman involved but I didn't I just told her that I was here for her (relationship was struggling) 

So I said to my mum ""mum when you were in this situation would it have helped you to find out""

and my mum said it didn't matter her best friend never once spoke bad about my father was just there to support her when things got rocky. She said it was the best thing for her and helped her get away from my cheating emotionally abusing father

I don't think its a friends place to give opinions about the guy they have chosen. I think its a friends place to be there no matter what. Yes say you don't think its a good idea but make sure you tell them you understand that their happiness is the most important and if he makes her happy than that's the important thing and you support her 100%

Maybe it will make her see that he doesn't make her happy. But if you say bad things about her partner its likely to ruin your friendship."

COCOnizzle,TwoXChromosomes,1391128488.0,"Morning sickness can last longer than the first trimester. Mine didn't go away until about the 32 week mark.

Itchy skin. My entire torso itches so much at times! My nipples itch to the point that squeezing tightly doesn't even help. Stock up on good lotions/creams. (Aquaphor has saved my life!)

Food cravings are serious business. I was a heavy weed smoker until I got pregnant, and munchies have nothing on pregnancy cravings. They can literally make me angry. (I woke up today angry because I NEEDED a juicy burger, crispy fries, and a milkshake. I was even more angry when I had to settle for oatmeal and fruit.)

Heartburn is NO JOKE! I have woken up to stomach acid in my mouth before. Tums does nothing. However, heartburn is a great excuse to eat lots of yummy ice cream.

People will have a lot to say about what you should or should not do. Unsolicited advice is plentiful. I just got good at saying ""mmhmm"", nodding, and dropping it.

I don't think I have ever been so physically exhausted from doing nothing in my life! I can sit in my recliner all day, but my feet will hurt so badly! The problem is that I can't always sleep. There are sleepless nights. There are nights that I wake up and eat at 3 AM. There are nights that I just can't get comfortable. There are nights that I wake up every hour for no reason. Then there are nights that I sleep 14 hours. There are nights that I sleep so deeply that I snore.

I am due March 7th, even though Little One will come when she decides. I could talk about this all day. When you do get pregnant, join /r/BabyBumps. Having a community that knows exactly what I am going through has been a huge help! I can complain about the little things, share my off the wall thoughts, or enjoy a good chuckle when I fart so loudly it wakes me and husband up in the middle of the night. Pregnancy is hard, but man does it go quickly! I swear just yesterday I was going to my first ultrasound.

For the record I was attempting to be helpful. You are the one throwing it in my face. 

You seem to already have all the answers, so why did you bother asking?

For the record none of my answers were incorrect as you keep ""rudely"" insinuating. They just were just not as detailed as you seem to be demanding, because I was trying to avoid writing a novel. 

You attack me in reply based on some imagined slight. Then you insult me repeatedly and waste my time, because I didn't give you detailed enough answers. To top it all off you then tell me to be more thoughtful in the future.

Well that is some advice I'm happy to take. Next time you ask for help or advice I will think twice about trying to be helpful.

hilkito,AdviceAnimals,1391128743.0,"I could explain, but I'll give you an apparently trustworthy source:

&gt; For the specific details, we’ll turn to linguist and author, David Crystal, from Northern Ireland.  According to Crystal, a song’s melody cancels out the intonations of speech, followed by the beat of the music cancelling out the rhythm of speech.  Once this takes place, singers are forced to stress syllables as they are accented in the music, which forces singers to elongate their vowels.  Singers who speak with an accent, but sing it without, aren’t trying to throw their voice to be deceptive or to appeal to a different market; they are simply singing in a way that naturally comes easiest, which happens to be a more neutral way of speaking, which also just so happens to be the core of what many people consider an “American” accent.

Pau was huge because I'm skeptical Bynum could have stayed healthy enough to provide a legitimate #2 for the Lakers but yeah they were doing pretty great that season even without Pau. But Pau absolutely put them over the top, he and Kobe's game suited each other perfectly."

mkvgtired,worldnews,1391129054.0,"&gt; How did the US government allow a corporation to become so powerful that it can collapse another countries government.

Not sure what government you're referring to, but GS only ""hid"" about [1.5% of Greece's debt](http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/22/goldman-sachs-greece-derivatives-idUSLDE61L1KH20100222) in a completely legal transaction. 

EU banking and securities laws tend to be far more lax than laws in the US. This is evidence by the fact that [5 out of the worlds 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are in the EU. With new-ish EU wide ""one passport"" regulations these massive institutions are only getting larger. 62% of all bank mergers and acquisitions take place in the EU, not in an emerging market where you'd think. 

These massive institutions actually played a larger role in the Greek crisis than GS and are receiving taxpayer bailout funds with each debt repayment. 

They're not saints, but they're certainly not the exception in the banking world. "

Blizzard didn't have to overpower them to create an appeal for players to try them; they just made the experience simpler all around.

We have a symphony and the venue also brings in lots of other great bands and performances. We are also right near the 401 which connects you to Toronto, London, Niagara Falls etc for great weekend trips.

Also, since we have three post-secondary institutions in the tri-cities (Waterloo, Kitchener, Cambridge), you will find we have a really young population.

Well to be fair, they did give them the option to pay $250 on their rent. 

Ok Logan Square hipsters take note, because M Fishman is all over the place down there. They're like the herpes of multi-unit housing in that neighborhood, and years ago when I lived in Logan I lived in a craptastic M Fishman building. When it comes time to check out the apartment, make sure you check every last corner. I was such an innocent and trusting girl when I rented from them. And the year I was one of their tenants, I had the worst water pressure...the water routinely just stopped flowing while I was showering. Pretty much every shower I took this happened. I called and left multiple requests with them. Of course nothing happened. The furnace, dear god, made the most satanic noises, and took up the space of an entire closet.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391129780.0,"I'm not sure the status of Paulville, but as far as the rest of your post, I understand you, but ultimately, we still live in a society governed by laws, and that's a major reason in why society is as safe as it is. If we got rid of the state, those who would wanna kill people would, and this would make others more paranoid and more likely to be violent themselves. Society could very well unravel without law. 

Take New orleans after Katrina for instance. People started looting crap, this led to people who would otherwise be law abiding camping out on their roof tops with rifles and stuff. 

Or take your picturesque zombie apocalypse. In such societies, you have some people being good, sure, but you have a lot of bad people too, and sometimes the bad people force the good people to behave badly. 

In short, the reason we behave the way we do is because we are socialized the way we are. Change the environment, you change the behavior. You can turn an anotherwise good or at least redeemable person into a career criminal just by throwing them in with other criminals. 

This, I think, is a major fallacy of anarcho capitalist thinking. I think that people assume people will CONTINUE to act in the ways they currently do if the state did not exist. I highly doubt this would be the case. Even people who nowadays are upstanding citizens, would find themselves acting in more negative ways, solely because others start acting in negative ways, and if they want to survive they have to give up their otherwise moral character.

OK, seriously though.  I'm beginning to really hate Facebook.  It's becoming the next Myspace, except for immature adults rather than immature teenagers.

""We cant compete with Europe"" was a very common call of American banks during that time period. Those banks were never regulated, and helped begin the race to the bottom. [Five of the 10 largest banks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks) are European. France's top 2 banks have assets roughly 200% the size of France's annual GDP. These massive institutions put huge amounts of pressure on Northern European governments to bail out troubled European countries to protect their investments. They were definitely more culpable in the situation in Greece than GS. Yet you virtually never hear this side of the story on reddit. 

Heck, even [Greece's top banker](http://www.bankofgreece.gr/BoGAttachments/14.2.2008%20Economist%20EN.doc) cautioned about Greece's long term outlook (in effect their long term debt) but European banks couldn't be bothered to heed that warning because there was money to be made. These banks bet on a EU wide bailout and they got it. With every debt repayment German, French, IMF, etc. taxpayer money goes through Greece as an intermediary and back to these behemoths.

Buelldozer,MLS,1391130097.0,"I have to give credit to your superior experience and I will absolutely agree that most Coaches are garbage. My son's team is very lucky and they have two excellent coaches and one superior assistant coach. 

They took a collection of U8 mutts and formed a team that will play their hearts out for each other. This suits me as I'm a strong proponent of TEAM play. There's room for SuperStars, we have two regional pool players, but no one is allowed to slack and they won't do it anyway as it would let down their team mates. 

We travel extensively and have played more then a few Academy teams and with a few exceptions they're what I describe as 'brittle'. They have A strategy and A set of tactics and that's all they're capable of. They lack imaginative play, resilience of spirit, and flexibility in thinking. They will not ""save"" U.S. Youth Soccer, in fact they're perpetuating the problem that's plagued it. That's my considered opinion and I stand by it.

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1391130402.0,"*Ancient Inventions* by Peter James and Nick Thorpe lists several types of lock. The ""Homeric lock"" is mentioned in the Odyssey. Penelope uses ""a cleverly made copper key with an ivory handle"":

&gt; She quickly undid the strap attached to the door handle, thrust the key through the hole, and with a well aimed thrust shot back the bolt. The key did its work. With a groan like a bull roaring in the meadow, the doors flew open before her"".

A bolt was pulled in to position using a cord which passes through the door to the outside. To unlock the door,  an L shaped rod is passed through another hole, and pushes against a protuberance on the bolt.

-------------

The ""Egyptian lock"" was invented Assyria, and the earliest known example was found in Khorsabad, in the palace of Sargon II (721-705BC). This is really interesting, because it is a tumbler lock, conceptually similar to the modern cylinder (""Yale"") locks. Rather than a cylinder, there was a box with several pins above the bolt. When the bolt was closed, the pins would fall down to rest in holes in the upper surface of the bolt, preventing it from being opened. The pins could be pushed up and clear by using a key with several fixed pins, which could be used to push the moving pins up out of the holes, allowing the bolt to move.

---------------

The earliest key is a really odd device and difficult to describe, so I've put up a scan [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/nCozAOb). The keys were first found as grave goods for women in Egypt in 1887,  and then bronze versios were found in women's graves in Sicily. Their purpose was only discovered in 1907 when it was noticed that they were still in use in Ethiopia."

Tough problems require tough solutions. Orange problems require orange solutions. And there's never been a better time for a stronger America for the future of the hope of tomorrow. This man was injured in combat. God bless America.

Response:

What the President has failed to recognize is the importance of hard working Americans everywhere. These are people. Real people. Real people, with real challenges, that require real solutions to real problems. Tonight, the President said a lot of word noises. And they sounded good. It's not that he doesn't care about you. It is not that the President does not care about your life. That is not what it is. It's definitely not the case that he just plain doesn't give a hoot about offering pragmatic solutions to real problems facing you, facing your family. The President doesn't not care about your family. When I was a little girl, we had a dog, and a truck. Trust the middle class. Do not trust the government. Dignity. Purpose. Future. I'm married, like you. I have children, like you. I am the parent of a disabled child, like you. Empowerment. We will empower you. We will give you power. The real problem isn't inequality. The real problem is the GAP in inequality. This whole time we were thinking, ""Inequality?"" No. Those people were wrong. It is the GAP. We will CLOSE the GAP. GAPS need to be CLOSED. If you've got GAPS that need CLOSED, we will CLOSE the GAPS. We will scratch the itch. Best. Hardest working. Brightest. Exceptional. You are living paycheck to paycheck. You don't want to live paycheck to paycheck. You have financial problems. There is a GAP. A GAP that needs CLOSED. Whether you're a boy with down syndrome in Kettle Falls, or a girl with breast cancer in New York City, you deserve power. You do not want less jobs. You do not want higher taxes. The President does like to make mouth noises. But I challenge him, to listen to all of you make your mouth noises. We will face great challenges. The way Americans do. This man died in combat. God. Liberty. Do your part. God bless America.

Wait till you're ready to move out, see if you and your girlfriend are still together then, and ask your parents if there's a middle ground. They might be more lenient after a few years and after this girl so more ingrained in your family. Maybe they'll let you go with their blessing.

Fizjig,Leathercraft,1391130843.0,"This warrants further explanation. 

Just to clear the air. 

Your questions were not about the tanning process. They were about using veg tanned leather to make boots. In your initial comment you asked about the differences concerning what type of leather to use.

From a leather working perspective, regardless of tanning process all veg tanned leather is going to behave in a similar fashion when molding, tooling, cutting, and shaping it. 

In that respect the ounce only dictates how thick what you are making will be. 

You can get caught up in the alchemy of the tanning process itself, but the finished product has more to do with the crafting process than it does with with the tanning process. 

If this comes across as being rude now it's because my initial attempt to be helpful was thrown in my face, so now I'm just giving you the clinical diagnosis I should have in the first place.

The easy answer to your question is this:

Stop worrying so much about which vegetable tanning process was used. It's going to have very little impact on the final product. What you should be more concerned about is the actual quality of the leather being used itself. 

A high end, European split leather is going to produce a nicer looking, more comfortable pair of boots, but may not be as thick as you need it for durability sakes. 

If it were me, and I wanted a durable pair of work boots, commissioned and made from leather I would not use veg tanned leather at all.

I would use stoned oil cowhide leather, or something similar. I would make sure they carbouli the soles of the boots. (For that I would use a 8-9 ounce alum tanned leather. )

I hope this helps."

In any case, what's interesting is that the discovery of the Golden Ratio by all cultures *across* all time periods (aka, cultures that existed at vastly different times) is part of some sort of technological tree for mathematics. All developed cultures saw a specific progression of technology - tools, fire, agriculture, domestication, etc. The discovery of the Golden Ratio is the same thing, only to mathematics: everyone, in the course of developing their cultural exploration of math, recognized its existence and its aesthetic worth."

DeathB4DNF,loseit,1391131007.0,"Is there something you've always wanted to do?

Shift the focus of weight loss from losing weight to training for something. So rather than some nebulous goal of ""losing a spare tire"" you train for a marathon, a triathlon, climbing a specific route outdoors, a physique competition, etc. This way you have specific goal and aren't focused on just a subjective and visual goal. 

Logs. Log what eat and what you do for exercise. The changes in strength will be reflected in those logs. You can even attach photos of yourself after each training cycle, that way you can see your progress as well.

You've got to be pretty selfish with what you want, heading to the gym and training and not half - assing it and forgoing that occasional happy hour with friends or meeting up with them in order to train. I'll admit it, I'm selfish, training and bettering myself is something I value. After awhile it no longer feels selfish, but a way of life. You start to sleep earlier, eat healthier, and do things so you maximize your performance. 

My tips are:

(1) Schedule yourself to go to the gym. It's a meeting or it's like class.

(2) Plan and prepare your meals ahead of time. This way you don't have to think about it. If you plan on eating in the school cafeteria, learn the schedule of what they serve and start picking your meals ahead of time. 

(3) Snacks and grocery shopping. Keep snacks small, measure them out ahead of time. Don't ever go grocery shopping hungry.

(4) Keep logs of training and progress. Keep logs of food intake.

(5) Head over to the other fitness subreddits to get some ideas for your training or find a program and stick with it. Contrary to belief, lifting won't make a woman feel unwomanly or make her look like a bodybuilder. 


(6) Goal setting. Set realistic goals. Set short term and long term goals and make them quantifiable. Put it up in your room and cross it out as you achieve them. I usually go with 3-5 short term goals (anywhere from a 1-6 months in order to achieve) and longer term goals are 1-3 for about a year. Short term for instance: add 5 lbs to bench, 10 lbs to deadlift, and eat 1 new fruit a week for 2 months. Long term would be: add 30 lbs to squat, learn to swing dance.

(7) Let's say you mess up your workout schedule or you have a pizza by yourself. ~~Punish yourself at~~ Get yourself to the gym, do your workout and move on. Don't dwell on it. Just note in your log and the reason it happened. That way you look at it and go, that's what happened and here's what I did as penance, and why it happened. 

(8) You've got the access to a registered dietitian as a student, use them. They'll help you develop good choices when eating and avoid any issues regarding eating disorders. Seriously, in the quest for our own satisfaction we put ourselves through some horrific stuff, don't do that. 

(9) Train with people stronger and faster than you.

(10) Have fun.

Edited for poor choice of words that would likely promote body dysmorphia and other disordered behavior, sorry about that."

chickennooble,uofmn,1391131189.0,"This statement is an awful reason to not include race in perpetrator descriptions. If all murders and rapists were Asian females, then we need to find out *why* this is the case, not try to deny it or sweep it under the rug by withholding the race of perpetrators from the public. 

Consider that nationally, areas that are high in crime are often in low income urban areas populated primarily by Black and Hispanic families. Rather than pretend like this isn't a serious issue, the right course of action is to find out why the government has failed these people so badly - what part of legislation favors white affluent communities and what can we do (education reform, closing the wage disparity, increase employment opportunities, investing in better police, etc.) to make sure that these young Black and Hispanic males don't end up in prison (and therefore strengthening negative racial stereotypes)? Only once we've addressed this issue can we stop racial stereotypes from springing up. 

Long term, we're only hurting ourselves by withholding the race of potential criminals for the following reasons: 

-Less information on criminals makes it hard for the public to help police catch criminals. 

-Decreased police transparency. Knowing that the police is withholding information on a criminal who could harm you does nothing to establish trust between communities and the police.

-Persisting issues pertaining to race persist, as stated above."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1391131259.0,"Sounds like a cool stat. I'm interested in finding what seasons have the highest PAR.

However, I'm not sure about some of the commentary, which reeks of the same issues a lot of advanced stat commentary has. For example, the mid range shot is understandably seen as the least efficient shot. You don't get fouled much and you only get two points for it. Shooting 52% from MR (which is excellent) is like shooting 35% from 3s (average). 

That said, what it does is open up driving lanes for you (the counter-LeBron, if you will) and give you a decent bailout shot if you're good at shooting them. You obviously wouldn't design a play to get anyone but the best MR shooters a semi-open midrange shot, but it's better to take a contested MR shot (as a good shooter) than to drive haphazardly at the basket. 

In other words, like any other stat, it's important to remember the context. Shooting mid range shots as a bailout shot, or shooting desperation 3s as time expires will hurt your stats. Avoiding these shots (the Harden, if you will) will bloat your stats, PAR included. Getting superstar treatment will bloat your stats, PAR included. These things are always useful to remember!"

mkvgtired,europe,1391131287.0,"&gt;Everyone did currency swaps, and nobody disclosed them at the time, it was the custom.

This is exactly the problem. These transactions masked the debt of nations and were *very* common throughout Europe, yet European regulators did not think to include them in debt calculations. I find this pretty suspicious, and almost think it was a conscious decision by Germany and France to realize their dream of a federalized Europe. There were man countries with questionable credentials, yet it seems like most were waived through into Euro membership.

&gt;The Goldman deal had a direct cost of 500 million Euros, and an indirect cost of 1 billion Euros

The total cost (which is *very* generous), of 1.5 billion Euros, is still less than 1% of all of Greece's outstanding debt at the time, and only masked 1.6% of Greece's total debt at the time. Now it is an even more minuscule portion as their debt has grown substantially. As I said, currency swaps are legal and very common. European regulators should have known to force disclosure of any of these transactions for countries entering the Euro. 

I am certainly not saying Goldman are saints, but you cant ignore the fact that at the time European regulators were very likely knowingly ignoring the fact potential Eurozone countries were twisting the truth to let them join the Euro. "

ha_nope,trees,1391131347.0,"Being addicted to weed to the point where you can't find it in your self to quit is a lot more common than you think. The problem with weed is it kind of eases it self into your life and slowly takes over. You just stop doing other things until the point where you find your self just wanting to smoke instead of do other things. With alcohol and other harder drugs you end up in a hospital and they know you're addicted, so you get help. I see so many of many friends in high school, me included that have gotten to the point where we can't quit if we need to. Most of us have tried and failed.

However, they shouldn't be allowing her to act like this at work.

Write down every single interaction that the two of you have with details. Also, write down every single response/interaction you have with HR about this.

I love my height but hate the way my height is treated sometimes. This place doesn't need to try and shove that under the rug, or even any of the people who really do struggle with coming to terms with their height. Doing so won't actually fix either issue, and seems selfish and nearsighted to me.

Does anyone use those things? The question is not whether a book says that it is appropriate, but whether is is *actually* used socially - and in my experience it is for any formal social occasion, i.e. anywhere where ""May I introduce Ms Caffarelli"" would otherwise be appropriate. This includes wedding invitations, although there seems to be no consistent choice between ""Doctor and Doctor XXXX"" and ""Doctors XXXX"" for a couple. If you'd raised the question a few weeks back, I could have dug up a stack of Christmas card envelopes to illustrate the point.

&gt; show me a source roughly contemporary to Wilson that says it is acceptable for an academic doctorate to use Dr. socially?

Wrong way around. This is not a question of whether a doctor refers to themselves by title (you wouldn't say ""I am Ms. Cafarelli"" either!) but whether other people will use that title of the doctor.

EDIT - Rev. Dr. - the convention with ""Reverend"" is that a complete name should follow it, so you can say ""the Reverend Fred Smith"" or ""the Reverend Dr Smith"", but not ""the Reverend Smith"". It's not a title in the same way as ""Dr"". So if a name can start with ""Rev. Dr."", that's only because a name starting with ""Dr."" will fit in the context. And yes, I'm being a bit prescriptive rather than descriptive, but I think you will find that most people follow this convention."

This is the general consensus in the gun owner community, which apparently you don't know because you aren't a a gun owner I assume.  Here is some links in case you still doubt that most people feel this way.  

http://www.policemag.com/channel/patrol/articles/2013/05/san-dimas-california-06-20-1989.aspx

&gt;Cop critics love to Monday morning quarterback the number of rounds fired in an officer-involved shooting, and cited Brown's as excessive, despite the fact that the suspect was still able to fall at his feet. In light of a recent Missouri-based shooting where it took more than 70 hits to down a determined suspect, is there such a thing as an excessive number of rounds that can be fired? What are your criteria?  

http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2013/10/pocket-magnum-revolvers/3/

&gt;When you’re firing at 10 yards or less, you should be able to strike centermass if you’ll put in the necessary practice. **Forget about aiming anywhere else (the assailant’s leg, arm or whatever), and don’t fire just once—keep shooting until the target is clearly out of action or your gun clicks empty.**  

http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2014/01/robert-farago/self-defense-tip-keep-shooting-until-you-dont-have-to-nsfw/

http://www.northeastshooters.com/vbulletin/archive/index.php/t-41962.html  



The idea when shooting in a self defense situation is to ensure that the assailant can no longer pose a threat to you.  It can take a person up to a minute to die even with a shot straight through the heart, plenty of time to pull a trigger back at you.  It also helps if the shooting looks like you didn't just walk up and murder someone.  Firing the entire magazine into the assailant is a surefire (pun intended) way to show that you were truly in fear for your life.  I will empty my mag and reload if it ever comes down to it and your pussy attitude about it can suck my dick.  I'm glad I am not friends with such push-over wannabe victim assholes who would rather see others rights to protect themselves restricted because you aren't comfortable with a weapon.  If you ever get mugged have fun giving up your money, phone, and possibly your dignity.  Meanwhile if I ever get mugged I'll enjoy filling out that police report about the dead body I was forced to leave on the ground.  Any scum who would threaten your life for your possessions deserves to die.  I'd rather kill the bastard than allow him to live and go through court and possibly attack someone else.  You're welcome.

Also the case really is a little sparkley like you see in mainly the picutres I took with flash on. It's really pretty, but the pictures exaggerate the sparkle, and you can only see them if you bring the ds to a few cm in front of your face.. Otherwise it looks like a solid purple colour!

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391131721.0,"&gt; Just like your other beliefs, your economic beliefs are subjective.

So are yours. 

&gt;And where is the border between personal freedom and economic freedom? What we can or cannot do with the fruits of our labor, whether or not some government forces us to give up large amounts of our income just because we live in the geographical area they claim to own, whether or not a government has the right to seize what we own, what we are allowed to own; all of this is very personal. To say that people know how to make the best personal choices for themselves and those around them but not the best economic ones is contradictory.

I would honestly still allow economic choice in my ideal world. By having a universal basic income rather than a plethora of different targetted welfare programs, I give people the opportunity to spend the money buying whatever they want. 

I also would not have a planned economy, but rather a predominantly capitalist one where people can start their own businesses and profit off of them, etc.

However, I do think there are some rules that should apply to interactions. I think there should be rules against low wages. This is to prevent exploitation and give PEOPLE more financial independence, and therefore freedom to do more things. I think there should be standardized work weeks and safety regulations and environmental regulatons. To discuss work weeks, limitations to hours, etc., this is not necessarily intended to take away peoples' freedom to work, but rather, to give them the freedom to enjoy themselves and pursue things outside of work. After all, if you do not mandate these things, employers will pay lower wages and require people to work longer. This gives more freedom to employers, but takes it away from employees. My policies are meant to limit the freedom of the affluent, in order to give more freedom to the common man. Because quite frankly, otherwise, you're giving the rich the freedom to dictate how others should live their lives to the very minute. And while under your system, such itneractions are ""voluntary"" they're voluntary because you have the metaphorical gun of starvation and homelessness pointed at their heads. "

It's been a long time since I watched it so it's not so clear anymore, but I did rant extensively because it disappointed me -- but anyway I think one of my main points back then was that it was so messily written that any significant point was completely lost in there. The entire thing is thrown together but it's the tacked on solution to a plot that was going nowhere in particular that's the final nail in the coffin. That aesop resembles an afterthought more than anything else, and it's just such a waste of potential that it doesn't even dare to conclude that maybe life isn't that simple -- I mean, the movie itself is obviously a product of the same kind of nostalgia as Gil's so there's a sort of meta-conflict there, and that's just left to float as unused potential. I also think [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1605783/board/nest/195048216?ref_=tt_bd_5) is a valid critique, the movie is completely out of touch with itself and the rest of the world AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO BEAUTIFUL.

JamesGray,AskMen,1391131887.0,"I'm not a mental health practitioner or anything, but what has helped for me is to simply stop and evaluate my behaviour. Sometimes, simply being aware of what the reasons are behind why I'm reacting the way I am is enough to help me undermine that behaviour from happening in the first place. It's like I'm not feeling crappy about what happened to me because of what actually happened, I'm just feeling sorry for myself, and if I'm just feeling sorry for myself, then what's really bumming me out so much? Sometimes putting it into those explicit terms really helps me stop from taking part in the standard pity-party and actually evaluate how I can improve the thing that really is bothering me. And really, it's almost never as world-shattering as it is when I'm in the throes of ""why me"". 

What it comes down to is that positive change through self reflection is infinitely better than anything that comes from purely negative emotions like those that come with honest-to-god (not joking) self deprecation. Chances are, you're actually a pretty solid person who has a lot going for him and it's just a negative feedback loop that makes you get so caught up with the bad shit going on. Once you break free of that, it's not only a lot easier to improve yourself and your general self image, while realizing that not only do you not have it that bad, but also to see that you actually are a pretty awesome person when compared to all the people out there treating each other like shit and never evaluating how they act."

Gertiel,london,1391132006.0,"I feel a tad odd weighing in as I live in the US, but I have experience which could possibly be of help. I spent several years technically homeless in my younger years. Some of the options I had may not apply, but a few are probably pretty similar. What a lot of people fail to consider are the facilities besides the bed. You'd want to consider how you'll bathe, prepare food, and do laundry, among other things. Hostels often have laundry facilities at a fee, and some offer food prep space, and you'll want to consider expenses like those when deciding how expensive your option might be.

My personal experience: 

If you have shower facilities available to you as I did at work, you might think on a van or RV home. I was able to rent a space in a seldom-used corner of a commercial lot near my work for about the cost of one month's rent in the area for an entire year's use. 

Prior to that, I spent some months renting an extremely small space in a friend's apartment. His apartment was in a converted older home and the result of the conversion was an odd closet off the living room area. The closet so happened to have floor space just almost equal to a conventional twin mattress. I bought foam mattress material and cut it to fit. If going with a house or apartment share arrangement, it can be important to look at everyone's schedule vs bathroom and shower usage. It was lucky I was able to just leave early and shower at work as there was only one shower in the apartment to be shared among 5 people.

When the weather was particularly inclement during my van stay, I stayed in a local hostel. You might check if any hostels in your area offer any sort of frequent stay credit. Beyond that, make friends with hostel and B&amp;B staff. They can often hook you up with free or low cost food and entertainment in the area.

Last, always have a backup. You'll want at least two sets of work clothing so if you spill something on your currently worn set there's a change until you can make it to the cleaners or laundry. If the hostel fills up, a friend with a couch you can have for the night is very welcome."

Armagetiton,DotA2,1391132021.0,"I can explain why this happens. When Phoenix casts her ultimate, it does not turn her into the egg. Instead, it turns Phoenix untargetable and invisible for the duration and the egg is a separate entity. When the ultimate finishes, Phoenix is given full HP and mana and cooldowns (except ultimate) refreshed.

What we can assume is that killing the egg deals damage to Phoenix equal to her current HP, killing her. This is how Axe's Culling Blade works. However, Axe's ultimate goes through Shallow Grave because the ult also removes all buffs before dealing the damage, while the egg obviously does not do the same.

So, the end result is that the damage is dealt to the invisible invulnerable Phoenix, but it only reduces it to 1HP because the Shallow Grave buff is still there. The ultimate never finishes, so the invisibility and invulnerability is never removed.

This will likely be fixed very soon as it was a simple oversight with a very simple fix, just make it remove all buffs before dealing damage like Culling Blade does when the egg is destroyed.

Edit: Looks like it's been fixed in a small update. Like I said, easy fix."

Since this seems kind of targeted, it might attract negative attention from SRS or women in general, so I recommend being treading this ground softly.

It's a bit of an edge case, but I'm okay with it. I just wish people would take the discussion in a wider direction about living by axioms and the nature of quotes as being situation and interpretative.

At first I reacted to your comments with hostility, which is probably natural for most people but I really shouldn't have as honestly looking back you never said anything that was incorrect. It's just not a pleasant reality to accept and my reactions were less than fair to you.

I was actually doing really good for a while, getting past my hangups and legitimately allowing myself to enjoy life. I've been stuck in a sort of psychological dark area after a bout of addiction with a research chemical, and unfortunately since it's research I have no idea what the hell I've done to myself. Even after I got past the physical withdrawal, the psychological effects never left me.

I've been making some solid progress very recently though and this comment is going to really help motivate me. You reminded me of something that really helped me in the past at being psychologically sound, and that is letting go of the past. Lately I've been dwelling too much on the past and I forgot that when I was truly happy was when I was exclusively focused on the present or the future.

I'd just like to say again I do appreciate your response. You seem to be a pretty good person yourself, and I respect the hell out of that. I thank you for your words and wish you well in your life."

2. There's a phone app out there that allows you to enter in your cheat sheet into a note in the app. Put your phone away in your pocket and only have a pencil/pen on your desk.

i would rather spend a bit more and know everything is from a reliable source rather than not knowing, but it is up to you, also if you go for a 1tb HDD it price matches and gives you a lot more storage space.

and with either choice you still need an OS and peripherals.

You didn't cause him to cheat.  He cheated because he is an asshole.

You weren't the reason he is mean.  He is mean because he is an asshole. 

You don't make him bad. He is bad because he's an asshole. 

You aren't the reason he said he doesn't know if he can ever marry. He said that to hurt you because he is an asshole. 

Do you know why he doesn't care about the cancer, laughs at you, and has no remorse for cheating?  It can't be you because you two aren't together.   It's because he's an asshole. 

You weren't the reason he lied to you for so long.  It is because he's an asshole. 

And you said you don't understand how he could lie for so long and then be so cold?  It is because he's an asshole. 

He doesn't hate you so much all of a sudden.  He is just being an asshole.

Are you seeing a pattern emerge here?  You should be glad he isn't a part of your life anymore.  You don't see it now because he has (like an asshole does) killed your self esteem. but you will.  Give it time. Things were good at first because he knew that if he showed his true self he wouldn't stand a chance with you. But that is not who he is. That was just an act. 

There are two things you should do.  Block him everywhere.  Phone, Facebook, other social media. If you see him at school do not engage or even acknowledge his existence.  Second, work on your self esteem. At the very least go to the library and check out a few books on building self esteem. "

Also, during the Frostivus event this year, Svens ult was changed to lower the cooldown on his other skills whenever he got a creep kill with it. So it does show that the devs are experimenting with it somewhat, even if it doesn't come to the real game eventually."

This is why I mentioned that using ""Dr Husbandsfullname"" would be appropriate *in the contexts where Mrs. Husbandsfullname would be appropriate*. Also remember that the campus is not Real Life!

Cards - in my experience, few people use their titles on cards, and it would seem rather a rather vulgar suggestion that people should use a particular form of address. If anything they might use their letters - so ""Spoddick Ctesibius MA, DPhil, MBA"". But more commonly just their first and last names (in my case partly because it's difficult to explain to German colleagues that yes, I am a doctor of philosophy and a master of arts, and yes I *am* really an engineer.

But I think creepy much more accurately conveys that category of behavior. Because ""asshole"" also applies to redpillers, and that is a different set of behaviors.

Sure, someone that keeps pace with your car for a quarter mile through construction on a main highway, then rolls down his window to scream at you that you are cute, and says nothing more while you spend the rest of your drive paranoid that he is going to follow you home because he didn't say what he wanted, could be described as a socially awkward person. But, again, I think creepy much more accurately conveys that category of behavior.

I posted it to facebook and more than one person from there said CNN was smoking crack. Which would actually explain why they love that area so much.

Edit: I feel this needs an explanation. Now I've never considered Waldorf *ghetto* but plenty of people describe it as such. IMO, it ain't ghetto until it has drive-by shootings on the reggie, and in Waldorf they're rare. I'm only aware of one and it was a targeted killing outside of what is actually my favorite bar. Waldorf isn't horrible really, there's just a lot of poverty and crime and **huge** income disparity. You're basically either really well off or in section 8."

They typically cant retry them for the same crime, but in many (very likely most) places appealing an acquittal is very common. In the US the Supreme Court said this is a violation of the ""double jeopardy"" clause. The US is somewhat unique in this too, because a defendant is entitled to a jury trial to determine his or her innocence. If a panel of judges were allowed to overrule this, it could be viewed as a constitutional violation on more than one ground (assuming you read ""double jeopardy"" narrowly). But it would likely raise questions about the right to a jury trial as well. 

This rule has been set since the late 1800s, so I cant see anyone challenging it anytime soon."

Same, kind of, with Whitacre. I absolutely appreciate what he's done to make choral music more accessible and I think it's really appropriate music for a lot of choirs, but I've heard it so much it got really boring and predictable. I don't want to say it's inherently bad music, but it's a style that one can only sing and listen to so much, if you know what I mean. 

And certainly there's a lot of interesting things done with contemporary composers that take a leaf out of the Renaissance playbook. I guess this is more of how my personal musical journey has gone, but once I really started ""getting"" actual early music, the contemporary stuff sort of feels like a pale imitation, which I don't like as much. Again, it's not *bad* per se, just something I'm tired of as a singer. XD

Anyway, by 24 I meant [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Four-Italian-Seventeenth-Eighteenth-Centuries/dp/0793510066), which is pretty much the book that every beginning singer learns from at some point, myself included. If you've heard any high school or early undergraduate recital or similar, you've heard something from it - probably ""Caro mio ben"", ""Sebben, crudele"", or ""Lasciatemi morire"". The music is really great because it offers some technical challenge while being attainable for a less experienced singer, and it's a really good introduction to Italian, but I've heard them sooooooo many times I'm kind of sick of them XD

keakealani,singing,1391133055.0,"Ah yes, I totally agree! I think those churches are out there, though. (Okay, maybe not ones that stage full romantic oratorios, but the other stuff.) The local Lutheran church near where I grew up recently did the Bach B Minor Mass, Handel's Israel in Egypt, and a couple other cantatas over the past couple of years, often with period instruments, which is really really neat. And the Anglo-Catholic church I was previously employed at also did a lot of great music, Tallis and Byrd and the like. So I think it is out there, but woefully it's harder to find than it needs to be. 

But yes, the more people keep fighting the good fight, the better. It's so important to keep great music alive in worship - I think it's really an integral part of church history and it's sad to see it overtaken by shitty 80s ""cantatas"". 

Super tangential sidenote, my husband's childhood church was HUGELY into those super bad cantatas and the really cheesy semi-pop church anthems. OMG. I wanted to cry sometimes. xD Fortunately one of the more influential church members was an ex-Catholic who still retained a Catholic sense of musical worship, so at least he encouraged some good choral music.

I agree with you in the case of vasectomies/tubal ligation, but condoms and pulling out have a very real failure rate, the risk of which is higher than the risks associated in other actions that have been ruled reckless.

The getting pregnant part is entirely relevant because it's that action that places a child in the position where it needs life support.  Abortion is only an issue because it's the actions of the woman that induce the child's need for support; if women were randomly stricken with pregnancy it would be a different issue entirely."

Geez...why didn't anyone tell me that raising your eyebrows does that. 

As a fellow pale as hell white girl, I can drop what limited knowledge I have about foundations. Recently that's been a goal for me and I've purchased Nars in Mont Blanc (there's one shade whiter called Siberia) because that's the whitest thing Sephora has. It's a really nice light/medium coverage foundation and I would recommend it to anyone. If you go that route, also buy a pump (Sephora was out so I ordered mine from Barneys online). Also picked up Kat Von D's foundation because I want something with full coverage but it's too dark so now I have to buy a white foundation, which I understand Mac makes, to lighten it up a tad. 

I do recommend going in person to Sephora, if possible, because they will give you samples of different brands so you can try them out and in different lighting. If you can't make it there, I've been doing okay with a bit of trial and error with ordering from them online. Their return policy is fantastic. 

If you're looking for something at the drugstore, not sure because I've never had any luck, but I know there are other severe whities in this sub so if you keyword search you should be able to find suggestions. This level of white is a problem!

For sunscreen, one of the mods recommended Elta MD UV Clear 46 (or something like that), which I bought. It's $30 for 1.6 ounces. Does not make me happy, BUT it doesn't smell like sunscreen and is very light. I really like it. It's for people with very sensitive skin. I think in the sidebar there's info about sunscreen (I think??). I purchased the Elta MD body sunscreen also and won't try it until it gets warm.

I have to disagree with you about Gameday though, I prefer Championship.  I actually like the assessment being at the end.  It forces me to really focus.  I do wish there was an Overtime in this one, but it's still just been awesome.  I also really disliked the skating in Gameday, I struggled hard on that one.  I do wish though that there was more pull ups in this series though.

I do agree about Back to Core.  It feels more back focused while Back to 6-Pack is more for getting those washboard abs (C-Sit OMG!).

As for what's next, I don't know.  I've been wanting to do P90X for a while, so I'm REALLY leaning towards that.  On the other hand, I would love to do the A1/2 Hybrid included with the program.  Then I saw BeachBody has an I/A1/A2 hybrid (3 month), and I think about that.  I think Insanity is a better program for weight loss, but the Asylum series is definitely better for physical conditioning.  For example, I think after doing Asylum, I could go back and kill the Insanity Fit Test.

Either way, I'm leaning towards P90X to do something different.  Then Doing the I/A1/A2 Hybrid afterwards.  "

Then I make it dark. (For enhanced darkness, I use an eye mask.)

Then, I put an icepack directly on my head.

Most of the time, I end the murder ritual with a nap. Sometimes, I don't have to take a nap, and can manage something like reading in very low light.

It goes like this:

After you walk into the room, the door is closed behind you so it's just you and the polygraph man/woman. Hand them your money, and then they strap you down in a chair with a bunch of wires wrapped around you and on your fingers. You're only allowed to look ahead at the wall while an ex-policeman (who specializes in polygraph tests for the police and high profile cases) tries with all his might to prove you're cheating. All the questions are 'yes' and 'no', so you can't try to talk your way out of anything. 

It's not ""innocent until proven guilty"", but just the opposite.

maowsers93,Austin,1391133646.0,"The environment thing is debatable. I'm not personally offended by the bag bans but I know a lot of people are. 

As for the public transportation, I'm sorry but you don't get to decrease the available lanes to provide more room for the very sad system you already have in place. Get real initiative involved for public transportation like a subway, a sky lift, an l-train, something. Reducing people's options for transportation is not acceptable. 

As for the ADA requirements I'm in the housing industry and the guidelines they're implementing are going to cost new home buyers thousands of dollars. The only way people will be able to comply is if they forego finishes they originally wanted and those are the people who won't be priced out by the increase. This is going to drive people to build outside the city limits increasing urban sprawl and negatively impacting the environment we care about. The land needed for the recharge zones to maintain our aquifers is not conducive to Dallas or Houston type expansion. 

There is already an affordable housing issue in the city. Adding to the cost of building is going to make it worse. Mandating that individuals comply with ADA guidelines they'll likely never need while increasing the risk of sprawl and decreasing the availability of affordable housing isn't appropriate. 

I agree that there is a lot to be upset with the council. For me working in the housing industry this ADA bill is the straw that broke the camel's back. We have gentrification on the East side, a massive transportation failure, and an affordable housing shortage and this is what the council thinks they need to spend their time on? Absolutely not. "

What's ruined your sex life is your wife being selfish, which you know, and I know you know, and all of /r/sex knows.

That being said, she's probably being sexually selfish because she's insecure about how her body looks post-baby, so she doesn't want you to see her in any positions that show how her body has changed.

I can tell you that race has absolutely nothing to do with my assessment of him as a President. 

Projecting hate onto others, when it is not actually present, is just as bad as being hateful. And race baiting is even worse. 

The tone of our political conversation is abysmal, and both sides are guilty. I can name endless examples of people on both sides of the ideological spectrum that have spewed pure, unadulterated, irrational hatred at people on the other side, and it is usually because they cannot adequately come up with a defense for their own beliefs. 

So, don't assume you know how I feel about this President. I voted for him in 2008 like many, many other people who now feel exactly as I do. We were *disappointed*.

How can you get mad at someone for a) telling you clearly she's not interested and b) giving you her number anyway when you pester her for it? Why does she have to answer the same question multiple times to ""not be a bitch""?

In my book, if a woman tells you outright that she's not interested, you have no right to get mad at her if you text her and it turns out that in fact she is not interested."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391133869.0,"&gt; The difference between my subjective beliefs and yours is that you want to force them upon me even if I don't agree. I will gladly allow you to continue your government and all the things that you believe if you just leave me out of it.

Ok then, leave the country, I won't stop you.

&gt;If someone doesn't pay enough to make the job worth it, then the person will not take the job. The employers need employees, and if the employees can get better pay doing something else, they will leave. In a free market, wages are competitive. Each employer is trying to attract good, skilled employees. They need to make the job attractive. 

Except you forget people need to work or starve/be homeless.

&gt;Also, you should not force employers to pay employees more than the value that they create for the company. This is forcing them to lose money, or tofire them. Either way, a low paying job often becomes no job.

1) Last I looked, companies are making record profits yet keeping wages down. Wealth inequality is increasing deamatically.

2) If a business cant pay its employees a living wage IMO it doesn't deserve to be in business.

&gt;You claim that you are for the ""common man"" (the proletariat?) but you seem to think that the common man is an utter dupe at the mercy of the bourgeoisie.

In a sense many of them are.

&gt; You imply that the common man is too stupid to tell when a job isn't worth it, to find a better job, to learn new skills, to get promoted from a low paying job to a higher one, to start a business, or to simply be somewhat sensible or creative.

I'm not blaming them at all. My blame is on the rich for their exploitation.

&gt; Why do people take jobs at sweatshops, which offer not-so-great working conditions and not-so-great pay? Because they analyze their options and see that working there is the best option they have. If a better option arises, they will take that. 

Yes, because they have no better option and are being taken advantage of.

&gt;Why do you fear a corporate dystopia so much? http://www.fee.org/the_freeman/detail/dystopias-seen-dystopias-imagined#axzz2r9WFYzD6

The Nordics ranked highest on the metrics of real GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, generosity and freedom from corruption.[7]

It's 500 years old, one of the most recognised pieces of art ever, and it was made by one of the best artists in history. You can't just sell it on $10,000 because nobody would pay more.

Talking about modern art: there's an exposition named ""1Tb, $500,000"" which features a Hard Drive with half a million dollars worth of piracy. How do you price that? To start, the HDD's price was probably around $80 and nobody paid for its content, but again, its content would be worth $500,000 if legally obtained. Should it cost $500,080? Who would pay that amount for a bunch of piracy? an EMP could erase it, would it still cost $500,080?

The meaning of priceless doesn't mean its price is too high, it means that it's impossible to determine its real value because you always have the risk of selling it too cheap or buying it too expensive. Pricing art is one of the most difficult things to do, and a big amount of the Vatican's wealth is in form of art that can't be sold because it's impossible to price fairly."

To find A x B = C:

1. Point all four fingers along A, like this picture: http://en.citizendium.org/images/thumb/e/e4/Right-hand-rule.jpg/350px-Right-hand-rule.jpg

All in all, it's unlikely your loved ones will be cut open and scavenged. 

The consent issue can be tackled by only allowing those who have made a decision to donate. However, merely changing from an opt-in to an opt-out structure (where you are presented with a form asking you whether you want to opt-out, and with ""no"" already ticked), will drastically increase donation rates.

LOVE these characters but what happened to the Vampire Diaries with interesting subplots weaving together and sometimes heavier focuses on the fan favorites but not always. It just feels like the same old all the time now.

Not to say the last few episodes haven't been really good with interesting, unique and tense moments... But it's lacking something it used to have."

wolfkin,NoShitSherlock,1391134454.0,"&gt;The majority of whites during that period owned exactly 0 slaves.

what time period are we talking about here? like 1500s when Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade started? Are you talking 1700s when slave trade was at it's highest or like 1800s when it was started to take a downward trend?

&gt;the belief that modern whites some how owe other races something because of the sins of the dead is nonsense

I think it's silly to absolve the sins of a people simply because they are dead. Their descendants have benefited greatly from the institution of slavery there are banks in England that exist today in their current form because of slavery and getting their fiscal check because freeing slaves ""cost them their property"". Haiti was one of the richest countries in the Caribbean because in part of slavery. Their current condition is in a LARGE part due to the debt they incurred when they got their freedom and European countries made them pay their former owners because of lost property. 

I do think it would be ineffective to say throw a few hundred million at the problem and expect everything to be right (not that it would ever happen but I'm not advocating for ""they owe them their money back"" is my point) but to discount the effects of slavery is uneducated at best.

of course not every white person owned a slave. of course a minority owned massive plantations. But the institution of slavery divided the colonies and countries into white and black and benefited the whites owner or not and devastated the blacks, freed or enslaved..

&gt;Also, northern factory workers who were mostly white lived in worse conditions than southern slaves.

that I flat out defy. As much as I've read on slavery there's no possible way a factory worker in any time period had it worse. If you're trying instead to say that the worst factory conditions are worse than the best slavery conditions then you're argument is specious."

Someone can be 100% service-connected and have a full-time job. Their wages are subject to all the normal taxes, the VA disability is taxed.

It only gets sticky if someone is retired *and* service-connected. In that case some portion of the pension is tax-exempt based on disability rating. In the future it will be cumulative."

Then we'll have an armful of contributors to look hard at to decide who we're going to cut. All the people I'm going to list are people I could see us cutting:

Malcolm Jenkins

Roman Harper

Will Smith

Charles Brown

Broderick Bunkley

Lance Moore

Joe Morgan

Robert Meachem

And as if all that weren't enough, we have to worry about keeping Jimmy. He'll want big money, and I'd be willing to bet our front office will be willing to pay him big money. So that takes us over the cap again. Then throw in that Drew is willing to restructure and there are an assload of moving parts.

I was telling myself that they were obviously just friends and having a good time and that it wasn't about me, when part of me just sort of... fell off? All of a sudden, I didn't care. I realized how petty they would be to spend their time laughing at someone else. And I didn't care if I was the subject, because that was their mindset and their problem, and it would have no effect on my life. 

For the first time, I genuinely did not give a fuck if someone was laughing at me. It was an awesome feeling. It takes real experience to get to a place where you can be confident enough in yourself to let it slide off, and I hope I can keep it up. You got this.  "

Capitalism is bad in the sense that it makes you want things you don't need and not help anyone. Think, for example, Carlos Slim. He has more money than what anyone could spend in a lifetime. Yet he keeps trying to make more, not only to sustain his corporations, but for his own wallet (he could easily stop getting a salary and still be rich for three generations). He has tons of money that will likely never be spent while it could be used to, let's say, end with the hunger in Africa or something. He keeps hoarding money and making business that cause problems to his clients (He holds a monopoly in Mexico's phone services, both landlines and cellphones, and his prices are ridiculously high compared to other countries, richest countries even). He's committing sin by omission by not helping those who need it. Now, consider Bill Gates. He's approximately as rich as Slim, but he has several foundations sustained by his own wallet to help the poor, the sick and the homeless. He's not showing love for money; instead, he's showing love for people. He still gets a huge part for himself but by giving to the needy he's not to be judged for it."

arcticfox00,asktransgender,1391134908.0,"It puts all the focus on genitals, again. Half the reason trans people have so many problems in the social world is because everyone assumes sex == gender, and so people are saying ""It's a boy!"" or ""It's a girl!"" before a child is even born and can formulate a gender identity. The only thing sex really affects, is how to maintain personal health, and what sort of gametes and hormones your body produces. Gender identity is what colours our world, but because for most people sex matches up with gender identity, the two have become falsely conflated.

That's a bit off-topic, though. The real point is that sex is actually more complicated than genitals. This seems mind-blowing at first, like someone telling you that the Earth is really flat, but it's true. 

- There's sex as determined by genitalia (primary sexual characteristics) - I think it's 1/100 or 1/200 births that aren't clearly a penis or vagina - definitely enough to be significant (about the same number of people born with red hair), although surgery is usually performed on those individuals without their knowledge or consent so that they'll ""fit in"". 

- There's chromosomal sex, which for humans is generally XX or XY, but then there's also XXY or XXX or some others. 

- We can measure sex by secondary sexual characteristics as well. While reproductive organs are primary sexual characteristics, things like breasts, body fat distribution, and facial hair are secondary sexual characteristics. We've decided that the primary ones are the only ones that matter, but again, not everyone fits neatly into that. There are tons of people with non-functioning reproductive organs, or some who lack them all together, or some who have primary characteristics of one sex, and secondary characteristics of another. Keep in mind that we gender 99.9% of people based on secondary sexual characteristics. We just assume that primary and secondary match up.

- We can also measure sex by hormone levels. Hormones do so much to the body, and you can really see it when adolescents go through puberty, or looking at timelines of trans people. Why are hormone levels, which contribute to our mental state and also greatly alter our secondary sexual characteristics (which people use to judge gender), why are they simply over-ridden by the presence or absence of a penis?

So while yes, many transsexual people 'cross sex', and decide to take hormones and get surgery, the emphasis on that surgery just isn't healthy. There's so much more to it. Our entire process of transitioning is 'changing sex'; it's not about just having one part or another. I'd actually go a step further and say that it's really not about *us* changing, so much as it is *other people* changing the way they treat us. Does that make sense? Changing genitals wouldn't really change the way most people view you. But going through this entire process, it makes our lives completely different because now everyone treats us as a different sex. The correct sex.

'Transgender' is a term that may make sense, if you'd like to use that as well. If you think about it the way I described earlier - we aren't changing our gender, but the way other people perceive our gender, the gender people see us as. We're transgressing gender by changing our bodies, and the way we present ourselves, and the clothes we wear, and how we interact with other people. Our internal identity remains constant throughout, but other people start to see us differently. Transgressing sex, or gender, whatever.

But the long and short of it is, **genitals aren't everything**. "

Kaisharga,AskReddit,1391135128.0,"Beginning of a shift is never really busy in restaurant work, and I was working cashier and getting settled in. The general manager at the time was socializing with a couple of the servers out in the lobby, bar/grill type place, very casual, pretty normal thing going on. Manager turns to me, ""Hey, catch."" Throws something my way. So I did, though I noted something seemed to glint in the sun while it flew. Felt a strange, sharp pain in my hand after I did. Dropped the object--a matchbook, one match pointed out, matchhead fuel spent. The glint in the sunlight was me seeing that the match was lit. I caught a lit match. Thrown by my general manager. Who told me to catch it.

I went back to the back door, and very, *very* nearly just kept walking. You better fuckin' believe the owner heard about this. He wasn't our general manager much longer."
justgivingsomeadvice,lakers,1391135129.0,"&gt; It's not like KD takes 15 free throws per game, he's getting to the line at a rate you'd expect from a perimeter-based superstar. He's just an insanely gifted scorer who leverages his strengths.

Patently untrue though. Kobe shooting 10 free throws per game in '06 is not comparable to Durant shooting 10 free throws per game right now, because Kobe averaged ~21 2FGs per game and Durant only averages 14-15. If Kobe got calls at the *same rate* as KD his scoring and efficiency would be a lot, a lot higher."

Being able to root and flash your phone to run a new rom &amp; kernel is an amazing experience and can actually make you feel like you have a completely new phone. You can do some powerful things with a rooted android as so can you with a iPhone. I find the iOS experience to be much more enjoyable at the end (Only due to the quality) but I think everyone should use both operating systems once as a daily driver to be the judge"
dunkeychick,AskReddit,1391135443.0,"So, I'm neither an educator nor a student cheater myself, but I do have a pretty interesting cheating story in which a teacher plotted to catch all of his cheating students.
It is not very elaborate at all, and I appologize; it is, however, entertaining.
It was a few years ago, so the details are kind of hazy, but my sophomore year of high school my friends and I were all in AP World History. It was taught by a really cool teacher, the kind of teacher you would want to hang out with on the weekends if the age difference didn't make that idea so creepy. But anyways, he was notorious for not giving a crap about rules and whatnot, so it was very easy to get away with cheating in his class. I'm pretty sure he even knew that most peopled cheated.
One day, he handed out a test and then left the room. For. The. Whole. Class. Period. He had also ""conveniently"" left the answer key to the test on his desk. One of the geniuses in the class got the brilliant idea to pass the answer key around the room, and almost everyone copied it. Everyone thought that they had gotten away with it. Some didn't even bother to at least miss a few questions so it wasn't obvious that they had copied.
Fast forward to the next day. Long story short, shit hit the fan in a monumental way.
Somehow, the teacher found out that almost an entire class period's worth of students had blatantly cheated on his test (his plan worked flawlessly). He not only made each kid in that class period sit down with the principle for a one-on-one, parents-included, conference, but he also gave all of them a failing grade on that test. 
As if that wasn't enough, he also spent the class period the next day screaming at the class that cheated. He got so angry at one point that he flipped a desk.
It was glorious. 
To this day, he is still one of my favorite teachers.

tl;dr Cool teacher plans to bust cheaters, he does, rages, flips desk"

RocGoose,funny,1391135569.0,"Some tips if you want them:

FIRST: Pick somebody to root for. It could be a team, or an individual player, but pick somebody for you to cheer for during the game. Maybe you have some connection to the city of Seattle or the city of Denver so you'll root for that city's team. Maybe you thought Peyton Manning was [great on Saturday Night Live](http://www.hulu.com/watch/1603) so you'll root for his team (the Denver Broncos). Or maybe you're a big fan of [Skittles,](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000318833/article/marshawn-lynch-skittles-announce-seattle-mix) so you'll root for Marshawn Lynch and his team (the Seattle Seahawks).

The key is to have somebody to root for (and thus against) because the football fans at the party won't enjoy someone saying ""oh I dunno, I guess I'm here for the commercials"" but if you're rooting interests match with theirs, they'll likely be more engaging and perhaps help you understand things.

SECOND: Understand the basics. The key to understanding all of football is this: you get four attempts to move forward 10 yards. That's the most basic element. If you get 10 yards in four attempts or fewer, you get a new set of attempts at moving the next ten yards. If you don't, the other team gets the ball. Commonly, teams will make three attempts, and if they fail they will punt on the fourth attempt, which is kicking the ball down the field to the other team.

Obviously the game is much more intricate than that, but the rest can easily be explained by a fan so long as you understand that basic concept.

THIRD: Have fun! Don't be sour Moss who doesn't understand. Be fun Roy who's kind of following along and enjoying time with his friends. You may not understand everything going on, but if you're trying to have fun and enjoy it, people will be more willing to help you understand and have fun with you. They will want you to have fun if you seem that you want to have fun and even learn a bit about the game.

If you're hanging with a group of good people, they'll want you to have fun if you seem you want to have fun.

TL;DR: Have a rooting interest, learn a little about the game beforehand, have fun."

Illusions_not_Tricks,summonerschool,1391135725.0,"You should have at least a couple champions you are good with in each role.

Also, I saw what you said about banned champions, and right now there are so many goods bans its almost impossible to buy a champ that will be permabanned (except kass) and you have to realize there is a reason those champs are banned, because they are insanely strong at this point in the game. So before you shrug off buying a champion just because it might be banned, you should know that you can win a lot of games by abusing these types of 'Flavor of the Month' champs. 

Just thought Id add that last part on since you said you dont feel like you are very good at the game, well one way to get good is to get good at the popular picks not only so you can abuse them, but so you know how to play against them as well.

Example: I main top lane and used to be pretty bad until I started picking up a lot of the FotM champs that I would get trashed by, and learn how to play them so that when the time came that I had to play against them, I knew how to best exploit their weaknesses. That alone made me soooo much better at this game.

Also, popular picks/bans fluctuate all the time. I have been a Nasus main pretty much since I started playing, and he wasnt banned at all up until mid way through last season when people realized how strong he was in the meta. Champs like Xin and J4 used to be banned all the time last season because of their incredibly strong early game presence, but now you really dont see those two bans at all anymore. So dont just base what champions you buy off of ban popularity because its really not worth it."

Although the Kurds dont consider themselves Arab, this carries over (have about a 10 page write up, if you're interested I could find it). I thought I was being scammed, but it turned out the guy was just overly nice. I had people fight over who was going to buy me tea/food. I had so many people share their food with me. Some of which I was a little afraid of. This guy with filthy hands was sharing his cooked wet black beans and chickpeas with me and we were both eating with our hands. He also was sharing his cheese and you could see the hand residue. 

But I didn't want to be rude, and figured he looked about 55 and wasnt dead yet so what the hell."

Did you literally just compare the poor white experience to TA-slavery like directly?

Among many other things the Asian community has traditionally migrated voluntarily. That's a very different dynamic then being dragged from your country forcibly. You speak of black people as if they weren't traditionally known for their intelligence.

&gt;past racism and ill-treatment has very little to do with the success or failure of groups

|

&gt;Groups succeed or fail because of their intelligence, which is heritable

|

&gt;No amount of handouts can fix that

and missing the part where I said handouts aren't going to help the situation for three.

====

&gt;Did I own a slave? no. Therefore I did nothing wrong and don't owe anyone anything.

**E:** Others have said it better:

&gt;It is a fact that most whites did not participate directly in slavery or came to the country years after slavery had ended. However, this…ignores the fact that pro-white policies (“preferential treatment”) in jobs, housing, elections, and access to social space…have had (and continue to have) a positive multiplier effect for all those deemed “white.” … Although specific whites may not have participated directly in the overt discriminatory practices that injured blacks and other minorities in the past, they have all received unearned privileges by virtue of being regarded as “white” and have benefited from the various incarnations of white supremacy in the United States.

|

&gt;The legacy of slavery has benefited every white person in this country–directly and personally. In a very gross analogy, if you run a series of foot races over 300 years but prevent 13 percent of the participants from learning how to run for 180 years and then give them concrete sneakers for another 80 years–but allow them full access for 40 years, it will take the 13 percent quite a few races to be competitive because the other 87 percent advanced their skills by practice and repetition.

|

&gt;“My family never owned slaves” is something you hear White Americans say. Although not racist in itself it has the effect of turning a blind eye towards racism.

&gt;Your ancestors did not have to own slaves to benefit – either then or now. If anything the opposite seems to be true: most descendants of slave owners seem to be black, not white, like the descendants of Thomas Jefferson. Most blacks are part white and most of that white comes from slave owners.

&gt;A white American saying “My family never owned slaves” is like the daughter of a Mafia boss wearing her diamonds and pearls and saying she never murdered anyone or shook anyone down for money. As if the diamonds and pearls fell from the sky.

My car is on its last legs (I have to give it a little gas to make the engine turn, keep my foot on the gas even when I'm braking while the car warms up or it stalls, and a number of other small stupid things), but back in November ish?, I replaced the front tires. 

I let my mom borrow my car when I was out of town for a business trip, and when I came back, it started shaking violently every time I drove over 60-65ish (which is almost always because I live in the LA metro). I figured I'd just nurse it a bit, but then a couple weeks ago, I noticed my back passenger tire was going flat. I gave it some air, then about a week later, it was almost completely flat again. My sister examined it and found a screw in the outer section of the tread (which can't be patched, at least not legally speaking). I went to get it replaced and the guys at the shop pointed out my drivers side front tire.

You could see the metal on the inside between the tread. No wonder my car shook so much - my alignment is totally screwed up! So tomorrow I'm going for broke and taking it in for an oil change and alignment. It's so painful to spend anything on it because it's such a mess, but it gets the job done, you know?

Clockw0rk,Games,1391135967.0,"I definitely think co-op needs more love in the game industry. Competitive multiplayer just isn't my cup of tea, but I do like gaming with my friends.

I think that's one of the reasons World of Warcraft continues to prosper after 10 years; it's the ultimate co-op game. Whether or not you enjoy WoW, it's difficult to argue about WoW being an innovator and major influence in accessible player-versus-computer content which encourages teamwork.

When it comes to more compact experiences like the co-op found in Army of Two, Halo 3 or Portal 2, I definitely think there's more room for story rich co-op experiences. I think that part of why there isn't more co-op is that western writers are more inclined to write about 'independence' and 'the lone hero', which is where we get the brunt of our one man soldier style games. Meanwhile, there's a lot more community and high population in some eastern countries, so we see a plethora of -teams- of heroes coming together in RPGs.

Now that storage medium and bandwidth hurdles are slowly moving out of the way, I think that we may have the option in near future game titles where developers can justify recording a hundred extra lines to include ""hey you two"" as opposed to ""hey you"". Especially in games where the player is little more than a nameless, voiceless avatar on a mission, writers shouldn't have much difficulty putting in two heroes instead of one. It may be more difficult for *certain* stories and situations to work with two or more player characters (intimate cut scenes, walking into a particular trap, etc), but that should just challenge writers to be creative.. or give developers to have a *slightly* altered version of the story when two people play.

Market studies in video games still seem to be.. not quite there. When enormous publishers like EA and Activision can push a 'blockbuster' title like Sims through development and tell people ""No, just wait and see, you'll love the choices we made for you"", there's obviously something wrong. So trying to justify including co-op as a major selling point requiring more dev-time may not be something that developers latch onto until we have better market study tools.

...but I would really like to see more co-op games."

A lot of them have strict requirements, and many of them accept women with young children only during times when they are getting close to reaching their limit, and even then there's still a slim-to-none chance that there's an opening available. I tried calling around my city (Jacksonville) for an open shelter for a friend (who had a 4-month-old baby) last month and found exactly nothing. I called every shelter and service I could find and not one place had a vacant bed, and a couple even had waiting lists (one was *two years long*). Add to that the fact that most homeless people don't have cars or money for bus fare to get to these shelters, and they really don't have much choice *but* to sleep on the streets. But of course, tell them they aren't allowed to keep themselves warm and give them a flyer with a list of shelters on it and tell them to whip out their cellphones they definitely have and call them up and ask them for a ride to the open cot they totally have just sitting there waiting for them.

Genuine spontaneous desire is not too much to ask for, not at all.

And especially if you need it.

Our needs are our needs, if they were wants or even just our preferences, there would be some wiggle room.

It sounds like she is not just someone who likes to be submissive in the bedroom, but someone who wants a D/s relationship, inside and outside the bedroom.

And that is NOT something that can really be done for someone, you *have to* also desire such a thing yourself. Because it IS a lot of work, as in it takes a ton of energy and upkeep. And if you aren't also getting a lot out of it, it will drain you of your energy, your emotional resources and your love. 

Just so you know, *(not that it really matters for you)*, my comment was specifically bedroom related.  I DO NOT desire a D/s relationship, definitely not as the submissive anyway, and most likely not as the dominant either.  And I don't only sub in my bedroom play. I actually Domme more frequently than I sub. I was just listing what I get out of subbing. 

It is also just as common for women who like to sub in the bedroom to be 'in charge' in many other aspects of their life *(compared to women who just want to be submissive in all ways all the time)*. And they (like me) especially enjoy the break from being in charge that subbing provides. 

As a sub, I tend very strongly towards service. This means that I want to do whatever my Dom/Domme wants and my preferences aren't really relevant. If he wants to beat me, then I get beat. If she wants to choke me, then I get choked. If he only wants a nice meal and a clean house and no sexual contact, then I cook and clean. If he just wants to come home and the end of a hard day and look at my body and not talk to me, then that's okay too. *I know this seems like it's bleeding outside ""the bedroom"" but because this is all ""play"" to me, to me it is sexually satisfying. This is NOT something I keep up for more than a day, or at very most two, with a partner.*

Submissives vary in what kind of dynamics they are well suited towards. So do Dominants. Frequently these different styles can't mix and match, even though it might seem like they could.

I can't imagine being in your position. It sounds like a nightmare.

I know you said you aren't asking for advice, so I guess I won't give it. But I'll say that I am very sad for your predicament. And I hope you can find your way out of it somehow before your needs and resentment poison sex and relationships for you."

Being that its family he has a lot more history and it make take longer for him. Its up to you if you think he is worth it or you are in a hurry to be somewhere romantically. Are you in a rush? You say doctorate so I assume you are on the higher end of 20s but that's a guess. My partner that helped me was back when I was 23 so we had no huge need to be serious to quickly and our pace was fine.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1391136381.0,"This is an excellent article:

&gt;Xia and co analyzed a dataset associated with 200,000 individuals from the Chinese dating website www.baihe.com, which has over 60 million registered users. Each person’s profile contained information about their gender, age, location, body type, occupation, marriage and children status and so on. It also listed the dates of all the messages they sent during an eight week period in 2011, as well as the receiver of the message and whether they responded.

&gt;In their first week of membership to this dating site, men send on average 15 or 20 messages and continue to send them at that rate. By contrast, women send twice as many messages in the first week but this rate drops dramatically in the second week to well below the rate men send and stays at this much lower level.

&gt;In general, men send far more messages but get fewer replies than women. And women are more likely to receive unsolicited messages and less likely to reply. Both sexes reply quickly to messages when they do reply, taking on average about nine hours to pen a response. 

&gt;So what kind of partners are people looking for? The general picture is unsurprising. “Males tend to look for younger females while females place more emphasis on socioeconomic status such as the income and education level of a potential date,” say Xia and co.

&gt;But when they compared each person’s preferences with the attributes of those he or she chose to message, Xia and co found a surprise. “A fairly large fraction of messages are sent to or replied to users whose attributes do not match the sender or receiver’s stated preferences,” they say.

&gt;**In particular, women tend to deviate much further from their stated preferences than men. That’s particularly true of attributes such as age, height, and location. However, they are much less flexible than men about marital status and number of children.**

&gt;**What’s interesting about these discoveries is that when it comes to certain categories such as height, education level, people’s actual choices are essentially random. These choices are indistinguishable from random selections, say Xia and co.**

Before any of you decide to move to China, I think this study is important because it helps to challenge the myth that short stature is the same thing as ""ugly"".  The social significance of height is cultural (heightism is a social construct) and not a function of human nature.  If this were not a cultural issue, then we would see the same thing in U.S. based dating sites that they found here in this Chinese dating site."

zmurfette,AskReddit,1391136525.0,"I was flying last week on Sunwing (they have a bad rep) and my boyfriend was more than sick all day leading up to the flight. Violent vomiting, body shaking, chest pain and coughing up blood. We were the last ones to get checked in at the airport so we didn't even get seats to sit together. After 1 hour of a 3.5 hour flight, the food cart gets to me and the flight attendant leaves to assist someone in the back of the plane. She came back and mentioned to the other FA that she was going to need her to notify the captain that she was going to be giving oxygen to one of the passengers. I looked back and it was my boyfriend, barely standing in the back of the plane. I couldn't get back there for about 20 minutes, and when I finally did he was puking nonstop in the bathroom, crippled in the corner with pain, and barely breathing. The last thing he said to me as soon as I got there was that he was going to pass out. The FA's helped me get him out and laid him on his back with his feet in the air, giving him oxygen and paging for a doctor over the PA system. The woman sitting next to me turned out to be a RN, and despite having a baby with her, she came to the back of the plane to assist in writing up a medical paper and taking his pulse and whatever else she did to help. Another FA was helping him calm down from his panic attack, which he got because he was so scared and caused him to stop breathing. They had paramedics meet us as we landed and got to escort him off the plane first and right to an ambulance to take us to the ER.

All in all, everyone was really great and helpful, even to myself to help me deal with the situation. Its the first time I ever had to deal with something like that, and I would not have been able to remain calm without the help of everyone on that flight."

FactualPedanticReply,AskReddit,1391136542.0,"The graduating class before mine in high school had some epic-level cheating going on all the way through school. I went to this special smart kid math and science magnet-program school, so none of these kids were particularly dumb, and most were pretty creative. The cheating was so pervasive (more than half the graduating class) that the administration actually couldn't enforce its zero-tolerance policy without getting egg on its face in a big way. Here are some of the highlights:

The school had block schedule like this:

* Group A: Monday: Class 1, Class 2, Class 3 Tuesday: Class 4, Class 5, Class 6
* Group B: Monday: Class 6, Class 1, Class 2 Tuesday: Class 3, Class 4, Class 5
* Group C: Monday: Class 5, Class 6, Class 1 Tuesday: Class 2, Class 3, Class 4

At first, when the teachers wanted to give a test, they'd just give the same test to each class in turn. Then, they started to notice that the Tuesday classes were doing much better than the Monday classes, so they figured the students were sharing test information on Monday nights to assist their Tuesday peers. They instituted a policy of giving different tests to Monday and Tuesday classes, but they found that students in classes at the end of the day still did much better than students at the beginning of the day. Apparently, in the short passing time between periods, the students had a complex system of compiling and distributing the questions and answers for the quiz they'd just taken to the incoming class. 

They supplemented this tactic by developing complex innocuous signaling methods via body language. Head scratches, coughs of varying intensity, foot shuffles, and stretches were all incorporated into a system whereby one could poll one's peers for the answer to a question.

On top of that (unsurprisingly for a Math and Science magnet high school) there was a fair amount of hacking. Through various kinds of social engineering, most teacher's passwords to their test- and grade-recording computers were known. A few other teachers' computers were compromised by hardware access + boot disks because those teachers were shoddy about locking up their classrooms. There were a few teachers' computers that were hacked via the school's intranet, but that was more trouble than the more reliable methods. Between having prior knowledge of test questions and having the ability to subtly and broadly boost grading records, they all managed to elevate their grades a fair amount.

Eventually the school administration threatened to take some kind of broad blacklisting action against them, and a significant portion of the graduating class (including those who hadn't colluded and felt unfairly persecuted) threw a hissy fit and refused to do school work. (This was their junior year). The administration patched it up with them and put some new safeguards in place that made cheating a bit harder, and they just hung on until the class had graduated."

I want people to remember that when they are reading comments, even if one gets tons of upvotes and differing opinions are not immediately expressed, that doesn't mean that everybody on this site agrees. Not by a long shot.

Then you proceeded to dig your heels in and defend the hivemind idea, even though your very first comment seemed to show that you were aware that different segments could think differently. The conversation just continued to devolve from there.

All I want is to remind people that it is silly and counterproductive to think of reddit as a collective that agrees on anything at all. That sort of thing leads to reddit getting treated very badly by mainstream media and other outside groups."

Basically what it means it you are playing with the concept of non-consent and choose some other word, a safeword, to *really* mean ""no."" 

So you can pretend like you are being forced, or forcing someone, getting to say ""No"" or have ""No!"" said to you, and keep going.

But to do this you HAVE TO have at least one safeword, AND a plan of what should happen after some uses a safeword. 

The safeword is for both people. This can be really scary *at least it always is for me when it's done right*. The person ""forcing"" can become overwhelmed and have to stop just as much as the person ""being forced.""

I think it's possible to make an argument that a person might not be less fussy when it comes to dating preferences, but consciously misinformed about their dating preferences.

AngelOfDoom,Bravenewbies,1391136865.0,"EWar (short for ""electronic warfare"") is awesome. There's a reason it's occasionally called ""e-annoying"", ""e-grief"", or even ""e-tears"". &gt;:)

With a Griffin (Caldari), you can jam out multiple enemy cruiser logistics ships so they can't repair anybody, you can jam out the DPS so your fleet doesn't take much damage, or you can jam the tackle frigates so your fleet isn't pinned down / can escape.

With a Maulus (Gallente), you can damp enemy ships or dramatically increase their lock-on time. Lock-time damps are exceptionally helpful when placed on enemy logi ships after they've been jammed, so it takes them awhile to lock on to people to rep them or re-establish the cap chain. Or you can damp out those annoying kitey ships so they have to move in close to the pew. :)

With a Crucifier (Amarr), you focus on enemy DPS. Applying tracking disruption to their DPS can cause them to lose optimal and falloff range of their weapons (now they can't reach you), or it can reduce their tracking speed so they can't hit the frigates orbiting them. Versus missile boats, this isn't very useful.

Finally, the Vigil (Go Minmatar!) uses target painters, which greatly blow up your target's signature radius, making them much easier for your team to blow up. It's excellent for those small, rapidly-orbiting frigates that the cruisers struggle to hit. Make 'em nice &amp; big for easy shooting. &gt;:)

If you bring enough EWar with your fleet, tears in local are almost guaranteed.

It's also effective for letting you whore half the kills your fleet makes from 75 km away."

You will decide when you have threesomes. You will not command her while you are actually doing it, because she wants freedom in the bedroom, but you will be her key to this.

mkvgtired,worldnews,1391136955.0,"&gt; doesn't matter what race, ethnicity or class background he comes from.

You're right, you never said that. I was in a rush. Most of reddit seems to want to turn this into a rich white guy issue, and then in the next breath praise systems based on rehabilitation instead of retribution. I agree he definitely got off easy. 

&gt;Many Americans just have this Americo-centric superiority complex where they think all other countries are poor and backward; rarely looking at the severe flaws in their own country compared to other countries.

That is definitely not me. I try to get out and see how other people live as often as I financially can. I am not sure what subreddits you're subscribed to but that is certainly not the overriding theme on reddit though. Reddit is constantly critical of the US, to a point it seems to assume the US is the only country with any substantive problems. Only a few minutes ago I read a comment like ""wow, I thought the EU was above corruption"" with a significant amount of upvotes. 

Case in point, go look at how many threads there are on the NSA issue. Yet, even in the European subs, they'll be the first to diminish or ignore European programs that are similar or worse. In a European sub, the top comment in a thread about the NSA was ""USA is disgusting"". In a thread about the GCHQ, people were joking saying ""we still got it"" and having a jolly old time. In one about Germany it was mostly how poor Germany had no say in the matter and was forced by the US at gunpoint. Granted I am sure the US said, ""if you do it, we'll share all our data if you share yours"" which is a pretty enticing offer. If Germany was truly against it they could have said ""no"" and the US certainly would not have made their refusal public. 

Now look at /r/todayilearned. Look up how many times ""TIL the US supported Saddam Hussein killing Kurds"". Those threads always fail to mention the entire world supported him minus a handfull of countries.  These always fail to mention the fact that Germany and France built the factories used to manufacture chemical weapons, and sold him the materials to make them. They fail to mention his largest weapons suppliers were France, China, and Russia. (Saddam even brought Russia and the West closer together!) They also leave out the largest financial backers were Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and ironically Kuwait. Yet I have seen this posted, with the accompanying ""Amerikkka sux"" circle-jerk countless times.

That is one example. You can find countless more where someone will bring up something where the US played a cursory role and you'll get thousands of circle jerky comments about how evil the US is. Dont get me started on internal policies. A sizable population of redditors seem to think the US is a 3rd world country it would seem. "

What a broken mess Hannah was by the end of the episode. That period of looking like the most stable of the four main girls on the show didn't last long at all.

The easiest way to control your speed is with a sliding turn. This style of turn is best used on a steeper or narrower pitch where you might not be looking at picking up much speed. These turns are basically switching from edge to edge in a sideslip. We point the board downhill for a minimal amount of time to reduce the amount of speed that we can pick up.

Carve turns are where we pick up our speed. Using as much edge as possible means that the board is responsive and 'loaded' throughout our turn. This feels awesome, but it can be easy to lose an edge and having a higher speed helps to lock that edge in and keep us stable.

Regular turns are somewhere inbetween.

---

The next thing to focus on is the shape of our turn.

You mentioned an ""S"" shape to your turn. In the bottom diagram, notice how there is no time for a traverse inbetween turns? We can add this traverse in by doing what we call ""closing"" our turns. Think ""C"" shapes back to back. This means that we will be spending more time going across the hill and, if you really need to shed some speed, going back up the hill slightly. 

If you begin to experiment with your turn shapes you'll notice that some slow you down more, speed you up more and some just feel weird. This is all part of forming your own style and what feels comfortable for you."

With regards to transitioning off Microsoft, I agree that you can do a lot with free and low cost alternatives. However, having worked in tech support and various IT departments, I can tell you first hand that ""everyone"" uses Microsoft when they go to school and that introducing applications and OSes that users don't typically have at home or have in an education setting results in the need for substantial training. The cost to re-train everyone and migrate may very well outweigh any savings of switching in the first place.

Some argue that Grey's hemming and hawing about which side Britain would choose (or whether they would get involved at all) wasted an opportunity to try to deter Germany and Austro-Hungary before mobilization got out of hand.  

I think Ferguson probably believes that Britain could have held out longer and let the continental powers engage in several years of bloodletting before committing land forces if necessary.  But just as Napoleon had a difficult time holding his empire together, the Kaiser might also have had a difficult time holding Mitteleuropa together.  

I think critics of Ferguson's position are right, however, that if Britain waited until WWI was decided in Germany's favor, the UK would then be even more vulnerable to a German naval buildup that could challenge Britain in their home waters, destroying their ability to project power and maintain links with their colonial empire."

A change in environment can definitely add stessers and make things confusing. If you've been with this girl for a year and a half and living with her (especially without sex) I wouldn't think you're just with her because of the previous break up. Your honeymoon period might just be over.

As someone who's also had anxiety disorders I know I tend to over think things a lot. Relax and give it a few months. If you find that things still aren't working then end things. At least you'll be clear in that and not wonder if you were just freaking your self out or if it was the other girl or something.

Seriously though stop talking to that other girl. If things do end between your girlfriend you should wait at least a few months until pursuing anyone else. You definitely don't want to become a serial monogamous. "

I sometimes babysit these two kids, boy who is 8 or 9 (I can never remember) and a girl who is 12. They fight a lot because they are close enough in age and different genders, on top of that they are incredibly difficult. So bedtime is 9 on weekends and 8 on school nights so I have to usually get them asleep before the parents come home. 

The boy (Let's call him John) was scared of dementors because we had just watched Harry potter and he refused to sleep. Without even thinking, I became desperate and I told him I was a witch and I had a wand and I would protect him. He asked where it was and I said it was in my car so he said next time I baby sit I have to bring it. 

Well next time was only a couple of days. I found a stick, carved it into a wand and stick a small feather out the back of it, burned it a little especially on the tip and brought it with me the next time I babysat. 

He believed me, I told him I couldn't do magic in front of a muggle, I let him play with the wand and now he thinks when I'm not babysitting I'm at Hogwarts learning to be a witch. His parents were extremely amused and refused to let me tell him the truth. This has been going in for 2 years. "

Not_a_ZED,pcmasterrace,1391137481.0,"I'm not the best person to explain how the two work, and I can't comment on those particular games, but this is what I know: Bloom makes light sources give off a glow effect that shows on everything around the source. If you've ever walked into a room in a game that looks like you went from a pitch black room into a room with bright lights and your eyes had to adjust, that's the kind of thing bloom does. Most of the time it's ambient, but it kinda looks like your eyes need to adjust, but won't.

Motion blur is a little simpler to explain. That argument that ""you can't see over 24(?) fps is because movies are filmed at that rate. Movies are a bunch of pictures taken really fast, so if you move your hand fast enough, an individual frame of the movie would show your hand as a blur, which is why movement seems natural in a movie, even though the frames should create eyestrain. That blurriness in each frame actually helps blend them together, so the mind doesn't view what it's seeing as a slideshow. Motion blur in games recreates this, and allows games running on super-low fps to disguise their FPS by showing a blur of a hand waving, versus a few pictures of a hand in different spots.

*as a disclaimer, some of the way I described these ""features"" might not be entirely correct, but this is how I've come to understand the effects."

The heavy iron moldbord plow, the stirrup, 3-field crop rotation, a non-choking horse collar that allowed horses to pull plows and doubled how much weight they could pull, horseshoes, mechanical clocks, flying buttresses, the Romans had none of those things. The Romans and windmills and water mills, but they only started being widely used in the 700s.

You have *so* many things to work through. He sounds like he has problems of his own and that just doesn't work. If someone in a relationship is struggling the other person has to be level headed and in a good place. You even said your relationship with him makes your anxiety and depression worse. 

Are you seeing a therapist? If not I would *highly* recommend it. Your boyfriend sounds emotionally abusive honestly. I don't know enough about your relationship to make that call, but if he's calling you up to scream at you, calling you retarded, and calling you selfish then those are serious red flags.

lamblikeawolf,short,1391137756.0,"This guy has a lot more issues and, to me, doesn't seem to be this incredibly well-put-together individual that is a complete package. He claims to be confident and good with people in his original post, but is confused about how to tell if someone is attracted to him, as he says in another comment he made in another thread.

In his comment history, he has said ""Dont really meet many girls. My major, career and hobbies dont really interest girls"" which also suggests he doesn't have too many things in common with females to begin with.

And he has also said ""I meet new people all the time I'm in college, none of them are girls I'm attracted to (aka overweight, dont take care of themselves) or they're taken or not into me""

The fact that the very first thing he lists as a problem is that the girls he meets don't meet his attraction requirements, tells me he has a very specific image of a woman in mind. And there is nothing wrong with that. By no means am I suggesting anyone ""lower their standards."" What I am trying to say is that if you are pickier, you shouldn't be surprised that you get fewer ""hits"" so to speak.

He also seems to be confused about how to approach women in general, based on some of his other comments. To me, it suggests a lack of understanding about contexts. In day-to-day life, I don't exactly want to be hit on. As an introvert, ideally, I would be able to walk into a grocery store and get the few things I went there for, and leave without even having to talk to a cashier. I don't want some random person even coming up to tell me they like my clothes or something. And I definitely don't want someone coming up to me, pretending to make small talk, and then jumping straight for the ""do you want to go out sometime?"" because then my brain goes haywire. I become extremely self-conscious, and super paranoid about being followed. I don't know this person. I don't know this person's intentions. I was just minding my own business when suddenly here is this person that I don't want to interact with because I don't want to interact with anyone, AND HE HAS BEEN WATCHING ME?! Because it is the wrong context.

Another thing - in his post, he doesn't really talk about anything about himself other than basics like, ""pay attention to hygeine"" and ""confident"" and ""good with people"". I expect a guy to bathe. I expect a guy to be comfortable with who he is, for the most part. I expect a guy to know how to follow and contribute to a conversation, as well as to know when there is a comfortable silence, as opposed to an uncomfortable one. Those are the most basic of basics. Outside of this, all he says about himself is that he works out and dresses stylishly, and even then, he just sort of lists those things and shows no real interest in them. Is he funny? Does he like anything weird or interesting? His other posts suggests he has hobbies (like videogames, debating and arguing, and soccer - also stated in a list without any real kind of enthusiasm) Maybe he is just boring. Some people are.

**TL;DR** - There are a thousand and one things he isn't telling us about himself that would give a better idea of his personality and any other potential flaws before jumping on the bandwagon that it is solely because he is short. Women reject people for a thousand and one things, and not solely because the person is short, even though that can be a large contributing factor."

mkvgtired,worldnews,1391137768.0,"Yeah, I hope so. As of now, its strongly recommended against traveling north on Karakoram from Islamabad for Westerners. Unfortunately you have shit like [this hanging over your head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Nanga_Parbat_tourist_shooting) when making a decision. That has actually made it much more difficult to get a visa from what I hear. You better not even mention the north when applying or it will be automatically rejected.

While these things are rare they still happen. Just like in Iraq. There was a terrorist attack on a bus a few years ago, and last October a bomb exploded in front of a police station in Erbil. Ambulances were obviously allowed through, except the only problem is they were filled with gunmen, not EMTs. 

Its an unfortunate situation, but if you look at probabilities I am sure the risk is still relatively low although stuff like both of the above situations does exactly what its supposed to, terrorize. 

Case in point. I met a girl in the Istanbul airport when I was heading to Eastern Turkey. She's lived in Toronto for the past several years. She called me crazy for going to Iraq by myself, but aside from that I learned what a nightmare it was growing up in Eastern Turkey. Regular police raids in private homes. Overall thousands of Kurds killed in the conflict (thousands of Turks too, which are often conveniently omitted). Essentially a full blown police state.

Her sister was following her back to Toronto to apply for citizenship. They were planning a trip to the US and the reason she cancelled: Boston bombing. Granted terror attacks are tragic, but using that to gauge the risk for a country of 310 million is a bit extreme. But, as I said, who am I to say? These attacks are meant to terrorize, and it worked.

LucasSatie,AdviceAnimals,1391137769.0,"Here's one to blow your mind.

I work for a gas station and we allow people to pump first before paying.

We had a guy drive off without paying *many* times, I think his total gasoline theft came to ~$750. 

Anyways, we finally caught him one time and made him stay in the store while we called the cops (the guy was a little older and we would have locked him in if we had to). 

So, the cops show up. Well, during the time they were talking to him we come to find out that: he's using stolen plates, he's driven off from other gas stations besides ours and something like he had either a stolen credit card or a fake ID in his wallet.

Anyways, this all sounds like ""wow buddy, you're going straight to jail"" right?

Wrong.

The cops literally **did nothing**. 

They told him *they couldn't arrest him* right then but if they ever pulled him over on the street, he would be arrested then.

Every single employee at my store had a serious [""wtf""](http://cdn.alltheragefaces.com/img/faces/png/misc-jackie-chan.png) face going on.

You know what the cops *did* do for us? They told us that if he ever came back on our property, to call them again and they'd come make him leave.

So, it's not just store policy that encourages theft... trust me."

In response to helminths or parasitic worms, the immune system jacks up production of certain Th2 associated cytokines and other cytokines such as interleukin-4, IL-5, IL-9, Il-10, IL-13, Tgf-beta, etc. There's also development of IgE antibody responses as well as mast cell activation and eosinophils, which are special leukocytes that combat multicellular parasites. Killing of the helminths can occur by antibody-dependent cell cytolysis (Adcc). Of course you need antibodies to coat the parasite to target it for death, and a Th2 response helps to mediate the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system, in other words the Th2 response is very important in the production of antibodies by plasma cells.

DayMan-FTW,truegaming,1391137929.0,"I disagree. I was extremely disappointed by P2. 

The puzzles were pretty casual, and for me became a grind. Not only were the puzzles easier, but the control over your character required to complete said puzzles was diminished. I'm guessing that was a result of optimising gameplay for consoles.

I was dumbfounded when I finished the game just as I hit some challenging puzzles. I would even say I got angry.

Like the top comment here says, Valve went for Polish over substance and it didn't work for a lot of people. There were just too many hands in the pie for P2 and the overall experience was diluted to appease a wider audience."

The community is absolutely ready and willing to support a good cause, especially if it involves one of our own. I don't think there's any other internet-formed group that's this large and also this caring.

The problem, if any, lies in the way the issue was first presented. Speaking, as most of here would, as someone with no inside knowledge whatsoever, it's absolutely possible for an 11 year old boy to be a fan of the show. Rare, but possible. It's also very likely he would be teased for it to an extent. But enough for him to attempt suicide? .. Hard to say.

It's clear that there are other issues in play, and I sincerely hope that if and when Michael recovers, he and his family can work through them together. But the average donator believes that the ultimate cause of Michael's current state is his love of My Little Pony, and that's what's come under suspicion, especially after the recent facebook post.

Now, if I had someone close to me in a critical state, and only money could help them, and I heard of a huge group of people who had a known history of supporting cases such as these (i.e. Kiki), then I would do everything in my power to appeal to them. I'm certainly not going to blame anyone else for doing the same thing. But I think that people still have a right to know the facts about the cause they're financially supporting.

All my best to the family, and I hope that whatever funds they do receive gets put to good use, regardless of what happens from here on out."

I am looking for suggestions for a mid week dinner venue for a fluctuating number of people (8+) in or close to the city. 


Due to the transient arrival times and numbers somewhere that you need to specifically book for X people with no way of easily adding any extra won't be a good idea, also needs at least one vegetarian dish for a guest, and cheap drinks are always a plus. 


Thanks in advance (:"
KrisJade,xxfitness,1391138256.0,"I get my main inspiration from the posts on this subreddit, lately. The women here are amazing. But I also enjoy various fitness magazines. I feel like they use a decent level of variation in fitness level body types, and don't look particularly fake, imho. The trainers at my gym and a lot of the other women who lift with me and are in my yoga classes.. they inspire me a lot. They look amazing, and it's great to see them working hard and trade tips and motivation.

I took a brief look at the site you posted, and I have to say...all the selfies there looked just like what you were describing, what you wanted to avoid. Possibly fake breasts (though who knows? Mine aren't real and my husband didn't even know until I told him they were reconstructed), heavy makeup.. no Photoshoping, but damn those girls look flawless. They look just like the fitness models in advertisements and magazines. In any case, not discrediting the site, I think it's awesome! It's actually reassuring to see people look that great outside of a fitness shoot. Assures me that I can get there sans photoshop. I'll bookmark and look more when I'm not on my phone. Thanks for finding the site."

nightride,AskReddit,1391138333.0,"&gt; The majority of successful female stand ups seem to base their material about being a woman and subsequently half of the audience doesn't really get it whereas men almost never do material on being a man.

This is the standard explanation and it's pure bullshit. You're so used to the male experience being the automatic default you don't even notice the amount of jokes centred around being a dude. Not too long ago [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LQw_J-sbeU) was immensely popular on /r/videos and I can reveal there weren't really a lot of people heralding him for being universal.

If not, it's just a waste of time.




Speaking from experience, I never regretted *doing* a play, but always regretted not. I worked my way through college, and missed out on some great roles. When I finally got the courage to say ""Eff this, I gotta act."" I got to final callbacks for a great play, and missed it. If I had just one ore two more roles, I could've had the experience/confidence/whatever to fetch the final role. And even then if I missed out, I'd have had the other two in my pocket.

ARUKET,martialarts,1391138513.0,"I can't speak for everyone but where I'm taught, Wing Tsun looks like an attack dog mauling the enemy. And we're taught a bunch of things to do in case the enemy does x. It's not like JJJ or Kenpo that has those really situational defenses you probably won't remember in the moment, but more dynamic reactions that allow the WT fighter to constantly adapt. That's where all the chi sau comes in handy.

There was a post here that said something about how WC has no kick defenses, I'm not sure if that's the case everywhere but at my school there definitely are. And they always say ""you should only ever get kicked once"" because as a WT fighter your goal is to get in the enemy's face and overwhelm them the instant the fight starts, so your enemy should only ever have one opportunity to kick you, at the start of the fight.

The issue, for me, is that there's ""grappling defenses"" which work well and everything but only if you have very good reaction time and I don't know, the whole idea of ""trapping range"" is something that seems impossible because most fighters would attempt to grab you when you're that close to someone. Thankfully we are always told not to chase hands, ever, and the only time you do any trapping is if there's a limb in the way of your punch.

I'm going to sign up to a MMA gym soon to learn BJJ and also just to test out the stuff I've learned. It's really not a bullshit art but I can understand all the negative rep. There are so many WC/WT/VT/AI0SFJDO fighters who talk so much shit about how the chun is the ultimate art and they can kick so much ass, but pussy out whenever they're challenged or asked what their school is or something."

codayus,TestPackPleaseIgnore,1391138607.0,"&gt; Are you sure on the math for the wind turbines?

Always a question.  Let's run a quick test.

I spawned in an empty TE energy cube, some universal cables, and a wind turbine, then used a stopwatch to find out how long it took the cube to accumulate 10,000 RF.  The answer is....almost exactly 24 seconds at Y 65.

**10,000 RF in 24 seconds is uh...21 RF/t.  Nuts.**  I was super tired when I ran the tests last night; I must have messed something up.  How I got it wrong by a factor of **EIGHT** is a mystery though.

That's still good, but it's not amazing.  Let me do some more tests....

Okay:

* Wind Turbine = 21 RF/t
* Solar Generator = 2 RF/t (day only)
* Advanced Solar Generator = 16 RF/t (day only)
* Electrolytic Seperator/Hydrogen Generator = net 50 RF/t
* Bio-Generator = gross 38 RF/t not counting fuel processing costs
* Heat Generator (passive w/ 5 lava) = 4 RF/t

As for costs...

* Wind Turbine: 3 Osmium + 6 Gold + 16 Redstone + 6 Iron Ingot
*  Solar Generator: 3 Gold + 17 Redstone + 8 Iron Ingot + 11 Osmium
* Advanced Solar Generator: 12 Gold + 44 Osmium + 70 Redstone + 37 Iron Ingot
* Electrolytic Seperator/Hydrogen Generator: 16 Redstone + 20 Iron Ingot + 2 Gold + 8 Steel + 10 Osmium
* Bio-Generator/Crusher: 17 Redstone + 13 Iron Ingot + 4 Steel + Osmium (plus the automated farm)
Heat Generator: 3 Iron Ingot + 2 planks + 2 copper + 1 osmium + 8 cobblestone


I think the Wind Turbine is still a good starter engine.  It averages almost 3 times what the Advanced Solar Generator gives (21 RF/t at all times, versus 16 RF/t during the day), but it costs less than 10% the Osmium, half the gold, 20% the Redstone, 30% the iron.

If you don't mind the steel cost, the Hydrogen generator is much better though.  Same Redstone cost as the Wind Turbine, 3 times the iron and osmium, but 1/3 the gold, plus 8 steel (and another couple for some pressurized tubes), but you get 2.5 times the power.

Comparing to a Steam Dynamo...well, the Dynamo is cheap (11 copper, 3 redstone, 1 silver), but it needs both fuel and water.  Seems fair.  On the other hand, I feel like solar generator is a terrible deal.  As for the Heat Generator in passive mode...it's dirt cheap, but 4 RF/t is pretty low.


TL;DR:  I shouldn't do tests when I'm tired.  The Wind Turbine is not OP, the Hydrogen Generator is good, solar isn't worth it, and the heat generator requires a silly amount of space and cables but is good in bulk.  No surprises?"

Basically, the Second and Third Age is a recurring pattern: Sauron shows up, starts a war, loses it somehow, goes away for a while, then returns to Barad-dur in secret, raises an army, declares himself, starts a war. . . etc.etc. So his armies keep getting destroyed.

In fact, preeclampsia is the reason why I had my first baby in a hospital.  You also ""can't"" deliver at home if you're under 36 weeks.

I guess what I'm wondering is - if you take out all the preeclamptics, twins, breech babies, diabetic mothers, and pre-term women - are the mortality numbers the same? 

On a different note, if you read further into that study the c-section rate for home birth mothers is 5.2% and the national average is 31%."

veloceracing,bourbon,1391138950.0,"What /u/rustypipes said.  The relative humidity of the barrels environment seems to affect it most.  The dryer climates (like a Kentucky winter) will cause more water than alcohol to evaporate, thus raising the ABV of the barrel.  In Scotland coastal regions the air may be more humid, higher humidity leads to more alcohol than water evaporating, thus lowering the ABV. 

Part of the reason why scotch whiskey may have a longer age statement on them is because the barrels they use for aging are often used American whiskey barrels.  In the US, bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels so the aging process doesn't have to be as long as a scotch being aged in a used barrel.  Of course, this is partly subjective and truly depends on what the distiller is going for in terms of end product.  There are some who say the dryer climate for bourbon aging also helps to bring out the vanillen from the barrel woods faster than a more humid environment.

LasherDeviance,TheRedPill,1391138964.0,"&gt; Girls are ambitious, too, but a lot of people find ambition in a woman unattractive

People find male-style ambition in a woman unattractive, e.g., If you have the ambition to be the best mother to your kids and nuture them and ensure their education and well-being, no one is going to fault you for that. Hell, if you want to be a restauranteur like Paula Deen and have your own line of books and franchises, no one will fault that. 

It's when a women want to be the CEO of some big company, not because thats what she wants, but to prove a point that she is better than the men around her in the same playing field, even to the detriment of her own personal inclinations. That's what is found to be unattractive. 

&gt;It's a sad state of reality when what men intend as protection, women feel as a cage, and it's both. 

Men put the cage around women for their own protection due to the fact that we know the nature of men inherently. Most women can't handle it when our true nature manifests itself through competition. Some women might think that they can , but due to our competitive natures, we will go to any lengths to best our opponents, and so we limit this behavior with women."

Continuing my understanding, this is different from a single instance in that a single instance is useful if it pertains to only 1 responsibility within a larger application.

So the difference would simply be a Singleton design pattern handles the entire logistics of a system (bad) and a single instance handles a specific responsiblity with the application (good).

LucasSatie,AdviceAnimals,1391139103.0,"You want an example? Here's an easy one...

I had a course with a woman who was terrible. Her ""questions"" would take *at least* five minutes because she had to tell a personal story, then somehow connect it to what the teacher was trying to explain and then ask a question that didn't even pertain to the material at hand. Sometimes there wasn't even a question at all!

How bad did it get? Why, I'll tell you!

She once spent over ten minutes (of a fifty minute class) telling a story about how because she's pregnant she gets hormonal and doesn't always make good decisions (I swear, she said this) and then proceeded to tell us about how it was snowing the other day and then told us, like we didn't already know, how bad it was outside and there was a lot of snow and ice and everything. Then she tells us how she found a parking spot but accidentally ran into the car parked in front of her and she tried to play it off like it never happened except that as she was going to walk away she realized there was a guy in the parked car. Well, she tried laughing off the situation buy the guy still checked for damage but there wasn't any and she was really relieved.

That was her story. 

At the end, the teacher kind of looked at her and asked ""was there a question in all of that?"" And the girl responded ""oh, no, I just wanted to share my story since I thought it was relevant."" Except that the topic was on how society formulates laws.

I shit you not, not even an ounce.

It got so bad that *every time* this girl raised her hand to talk you could audibly hear the small lecture hall groan. The teacher had to cut her off on a few occasions because her stories were so long and not relevant at all. I felt bad for the teacher but really wished he had reined her in more."

csmith1991,buildapc,1391139143.0,"This is what I'm doing, so hang in there with me.

Consider this:

Spending $1500 on a new rig every 3-4 years here is not unreasonable in this sub for a performance pc. That said, spending this dollar amount you essentially need to get a complete new right each go around (in terms of video card, cpu (which generally can mean mobo and possibly ram), and whatnot). You're probably going to end up reusing your case, and/or monitor(s).

Now consider this:

Skipping that incremental 3-4 year build upgrade once, and instead investing it in a well performing mutual fund, and then never touching it. It wouldn't be unreasonable to get 10% (for sake of argument, mine managed to get 14% avg over the past 3... yeah I got lucky). Then take that out, in addition to your additional build budget of $1500. You now have a budget of about $3500.

You spend this budget in its entirety *exactly* once. Why? Because you've earned it through saving well, and now you don't need to worry about being behind the game. A $3500 budget can easily get you to the point of diminishing returns for a computer. Additionally, you'll be able to get parts that'll be relevant on a 6-7 year time frame (hopefully). What this means is that your $1500 (every 3 years) can then be used to consistently update one section of your computer for the sake of keeping it up and going. Since the majority of the computer won't need updating though 3 years later, you'll be able to update things like your monitor(s), your case(s), or your savings account.

It's not that he's necessarily the one percent... I'm definitely not. **It could just be that he's patient**."

schencker,AskReddit,1391139239.0,"Sounds like it could be a number of things, but I'd (obviously) suggest that you talk to a professional offline. If I had to guess, I'd consider an anxiety disorder, psychosis, possibly schizophrenia. If you've recently used drugs, I'd consider some sort of bad reaction to the drug.

Diagnosis is important because it will direct you towards the best drug and/or therapy treatments for you. The exercise for eradicating intrusive thoughts is to identify the thought when it occurs (hey, this thought isn't a thought I'd like to think); stop or interrupt the thought; replace the original thought with something more positive (""Nothing is going to happen to my family and friends,"" ""they are safe,"" ""I am safe,"" etc); and try to move on from there."

fnredditacct,sex,1391139273.0,"I agree to check out the FAQ, it will have better advice on the pain than I think I have to give. Especially if this is one of those pain conditions that I have no experience with at all. And this sounds very similar to what I read in the FAQ.

But I do want to say that I worry that trying to push through it in PIV will be too negative an experience and only compound the problem.

My husband and I are into some kinkier stuff, and one of the things we play with is stretching my vagina. For me, this is what works well in that department. 

First, lubrication is big.

We begin with something that feel a little uncomfortable, but not outright painful. Then keep that in place for several minutes. Then add size, which starts to become painful. So I need something to distract me from the pain. Either a soothing touch elsewhere on my body, or an arousing touch elsewhere on my body.

When that 2nd size becomes just uncomfortable and not painful, we re-apply lube and try it again. It feels MUCH easier on this second entry. And then I mentally relax a bit, because it didn't hurt.

Then we increase size again, and repeat.

The other thing that can help is actually clenching down on that something inside. The act of flexing makes me conscious of tension and it is easier to fully release and relax when I let go.

I recommend going up to three fingers before PIV. Try to take as much pain out of PIV as you can and put that painful experience somewhere else that you are already more comfortable with in general, like his fingers.

&gt; Even in the times when homosexuality was technically persecuted, when there actually was a law on paper, on practice it was hardly ever invoked. Growing up we knew exactly where gays gathered, I myself was approached a few times on the street. Nobody ever hunted gays down, no pogroms of any sort. These days that law is gone, there is a thriving scene, many clubs that are widely known as places of gathering for homosexuals. Many public figures are openly gay, some are not public about it, but it is not a huge secret.

Assuming your purchase period is 6 months, if you sell immediately, that is 22.2% annualized. That all assumes no stock appreciation, which can produce even better returns. Also, due to the way the money is not all invested up front, internal rate of return is very high (around 70% with a 15% discount, IDK what 10% would be off the top of my head).

portugalthephilosoph,politics,1391139733.0,"You're kidding right? Do you know anything about the farm bill?

First off: Yes. Food stamps were cut. But, at a rate significantly less than what Republicans really wanted. The money that is cut is not magically going to ""the rich"". I have no idea where you make that connection. But guess what? That's not the whole Farm Bill. Let's talk about a few other parts:

* Crop Insurance: The new bill changes the way crop insurance is handled. Under the old Direct Payment system, subsidies were handed out based on a farmer's acreage. This system resulted in a lot of very rich people getting large government subsidies (Ted Turner was a famous example) simply because they owned a lot of land. This new Farm Bill, *which you want to veto*, changes to a Risk Management System, where insurance is allocated based on actual losses based on projections for the seasons crop yield. This means that the **poor farmers** who are hurt by circumstances outside their control (whom you claim to fight for) are the ones who are getting the subsidies, not millionaire landowners and corporations who happen to own a lot of acreage. This bill hurts the poor to give to the rich?

* Livestock Insurance: For the first time in 2 years, livestock farmers will also be able to get insurance through the USDA. Not only will this help the farmers who, for example, may have trouble getting their cows up to weight due to bad weather; it also allows the USDA to buy up oversupplies of milk to help stabilize dairy prices. This means that working families are spending less on dairy--you know, essential nutritional products--at the grocery store. Who profits from this? The rich, or the poor?

This is insane. In an effort to demonize Republicans, you are doing exactly what you claim to despise. This is a perfect example of how the tone of our political conversation is destroying our ability to bring sound policy forward. Both sides are guilty, and it's disgusting. This bill is a win for everyone in the agriculture industry, except for the rich. One of the largest parts of the US economy will receive much-needed stability in an economy that has been anything but certain.

If the same person were to drink 1000 calories with milk, they will get that upset stomach because your body is processing it all at once. So if you drink 500 calories, wait a little bit, drink another 500, wait a little bit, drink another 500, etc, you can see how it can really add up over the course of the day."

Keep in mind, reddit is largely an American website, so there might be some differences in the colloquial usage of the word ""socialism"", but around here, the last thing you want to be called is a ""socialist."" This harkens the cold war imagery of soviet russia, bread lines, dictatorships, violent revolution, and is often used as a political weapon against left wing politicians running for office (for example, when Obama ran for president, right wing commentators often tried to portray him as someone who wants to take everyone's guns away and establish a Marxist dictatorship). So it only makes sense for /r/socialism to be mainly for the left wing crazies, while the more mainstream leftists hang out on different subs."

thro_way,TumblrInAction,1391140060.0,"This is ridiculous.

We've got two possibilities:

1.  You believe the story is analogous.  If the violinist story is analogous, then, just like hooking someone up to an organ sharing system constitutes proximate cause if they die (if you don't think it would, go try it), hooking a baby up to an organ sharing system constitutes proximate cause if they die.

2.  You believe the story is not analogous.  Great, that's the point I've been trying to prove.

You've got a fundamental misunderstanding of what ""proximate cause"" means.  It doesn't mean only the *closest possible* cause, it means any action from which the result was foreseeable that, had it not happened, would have prevented the result from occurring.  *Any* action, not only the most direct one.  And for the exact same reason that a court would consider hooking someone up to an organ sharing system proximate cause of their death if they were to die (are they analogous or not?), hooking a baby up to an organ sharing system would constitute proximate cause for their death if they were to die.

Either it's a bad analogy, or hooking a baby up to an organ sharing system on which it is dependent constitutes proximate cause for it's death if it is removed from that system.  Those two things cannot both be false."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1391140151.0,"Well, it's a mix of a lot of things. The current political climate points towards a somewhat frustrated view of foreign policy between the US and Japan, especially concerning military issues; Prime Minister Abe wants to lessen the dependency of Japan on the US military presence, with his campaign slogans primarily consisting of ""We Don't Need Them"" (roughly speaking). Beyond that, however, you don't hear too much about the US in Japanese politics. Currency exchange rates and President Obama are the main focus.

In terms of pop culture, American music is heard on television shows from time to time, and artists like Lady Gaga are actually somewhat popular. They can't compete with native bands and groups, of course, but there is a detectable presence. American movies are often anticipated, although American humor seems to escape Japanese grasp unless translated properly.

When it comes to the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, most Japanese people today simply look at it as a terrible thing that happened in World War II, without too much overt animosity towards current American people. There are exceptions, of course, but those opinions tend to be more prevalent on YouTube comment sections than in real life. Very few people, however, think that it was justified in any capacity, especially with the bombs being dropped partially to impress the Soviets. Still, the general population leans more towards the ""war as a whole is bad"" ideology than any finger-pointing."

* it ran the processor so fast that it caused memory card corruptions by causing electronic interference  
* animation of crash had to be done vertex by vertex manually because the console couldn't handle his spin animations.

There is speculation many Racinguistas that Ali Sayed never even actually paid for the club when he bought it. The 2 seasons before this one the at least half the starting 11 were loanees. The only player of real note he ever brought in was Geo Dos Santos on loan for one season. 

Ali Sayed is now nowhere to be found for the last year and half at least. Leaving Angel Lavin (Harry) in charge of the club. The fans think Harry is a puppet for Ali Sayed, he has done very little to prove them otherwise. Aside from not paying coaches or players since September. Last year he also vetoed a shareholder vote that would have put the team in the control of the acconistas (shareholders) or fans, as you can imagine that did not go over to well with the locals. Also I read that Racing was offered 100.000euro for Kone for next season from Osasuna. This money could have paied the players and kept Kone at the club till June. Harry turned the deal down.

I speculate that Club President Harry is actually trying to run this team into the ground, as a coverup for the fact that the team was sold to a man who never actually paid any real money for the club.

That being said Santander is a beautiful city with breath takeing natural scenery. The people were always friendly to me and very passionate about their beloved Racing. Their passion is why I keep folowing this team thousands of miles from my home. This city does not deserve this, like any other Spanish city the passion for the game is impossible to miss. 

I am Happy that this is finally getting widespread attention. However I am afraid that it may be to late.

mrquandary,AskReddit,1391140519.0,"I switched primary schools when I was about nine or ten and there was a guy at the new school that tried to give me a hard time. He was the previous ""new kid"" and I think he got bullied a bit, possibly because he was overweight so he took it upon himself to bully me, the new ""new kid"". In truth it never really bothered me, he wasn't especially smart and wasn't as tall as I was, so I just put up with him and didn't let him get to me despite his best efforts. 


Fast forward ten years, I'm the assistant manager of the local pub and he comes in one evening with a couple of his friends. I recognised him and said hello but otherwise just left him to his evening. I hadn't really thought about him much over the decade since I last saw him but I still didn't like him and had no desire to pretend like we were friends or pretend like I gave a damn about how he was getting on. 


By the end if the night he was a bit drunk and at closing time he decided that rather than leave he would start a fight with my boss. I saw him throw a punch and calmly made my way accross the pub towards the affray. I grabbed him from behind and go him into a textbook sleeper hold (sort of a bear hug from behind with one forearm accross the throat and the other hand behind the head), I squeezed and he went limp so I moved us both toward the door, smashed the door open with his face and pushed him outside onto the pavement. By the time I turned around to go back into the pub to deal with the other two of his friends they were making their way to the door hoping I wouldn't give them the same treatment on their way out. I grabbed them anyway and threw them out the door before one of them decided to swing at me then locked the door behind them. 


Unbeknownst to me the bosses wife had called the police but by the time they showed up the bully and his friends were long gone. They were quite impressed with how I dealt with the situation as were the other staff and a couple of the regulars, my boss was bleeding from a cut on his face and asked why I didn't rough him up more before throwing him out to which I replied that it wasn't really necessary. He simply wasn't worth it. The last thing I wanted was to have to explain to a judge why I put him in hospital. The police officers aggreed. 


To be honest I didn't really feel like he ever really got to me with his bullying attempts all those years earlier and when I finally did run into him again I certainly had the upper hand. I'm sure that one day he will have a similar night and get into trouble over it if he hasn't already, this event happened about thirteen years ago now. not a bad story I suppose. "

Tall_LA_Bull,BDSMcommunity,1391140521.0,"I think it's fine to think about and talk about (of course), but my advice to you is to not get too far ahead of yourselves. You're very lucky to have each found someone at your age that you can explore with, but man, it feels really, really good to just be inside a girl that you really care about. Do that for a while and don't be in any hurry.

Also, I'd advise against ruling things out before you've even gotten started. Again, exploring your fantasies is great, but if there's one thing I know about kinky people, it's that they evolve over time. Don't think of being a Dom as something you have to ""get used to"". Think of it as something you're going to try. You might not like it, but I promise you can at least do it, in some form. A little won't hurt you, even if it doesn't turn you on. But don't go into it with your mind made up. There are an infinite number of ways to be dominant, and you might well end up liking at least some of them. It's not all chains and whips and yelling. :)

Finally, again, I'd like to advise that you guys start out slowly, with some pretty vanilla sex. The chemical effects in your brain upon losing your virginity are profound. This is particularly true for women. Don't feel as though kink is a ratchet that you need to start turning and then it only moves one way, towards the kinkier. Give yourselves time to get used to things. Try something at a low level before you try it at a higher level. And have fun! It's a great big kinky world out there.

Good luck!"

To respond to the claim. I'll point out that there are different challenges in the majority white neighborhoods. Remove those challenges and black neighborhoods could achieve equally low levels of violent crime.

[Let me tell you about the one time a millionaire did adopt a florida town](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1uj13b/til_that_selfmade_millionaire_harris_rosen/)

- he gave them free day care
- paid for college for any college they went to in Florida

If I remember correctly they cut their crime down in half, graduation skyrocketed. 

So now the question becomes why? It's a complicated question and as much as I've read up on this subject I'm not my teacher. But you have to consider things like 'welfare queens' which traditionally weren't a thing unlike how the stereotype would suggest. But Regan started it and papers ran with and blew it up and it caused a fundamental shift it the view of a program that was working a lot better than many thought it was. You can start there and expand oh how this affects racial politics how the social narrative on black people changes and believe it or not unless you're have a strong internal community like for instance the Asian American community the external narrative will affect you. Slavery's over and people still look at you like you should be a slave and that has an effect on impressionable youths who don't have a sense of history. It puts them in a situation where there's no incentive. Scholarships are hard enough to get even if you're a minority individual, jobs are harder when no one will trust you to work.

You can't absolve individuals of personal responsibility but there needs to be a degree of understanding when people do things consistently.

I've lived in a number of places myself. I wouldn't quite describe them as `the shitty areas, and the white areas`
at least not all the time. I'd actually do it the other way. ""the black areas, and the good areas"". And there are subtle and varied ways the black areas can degrade to the dangerous zones they are. But I've lived in a few places like Atlanta where they have (a few) black areas that aren't the ghetto."

For MY wedding dress. That I was planning on paying for MYSELF. Because I'm getting married this year. 

My mom saw my [tattoo on my right shoulder](http://i.imgur.com/Y1ToZmy.jpg) and just about burst into tears. She got really quiet and wouldn't stop saying things like ""we raised you to know better than that!"" and ""we gave you higher standards than that!"" and I got pissed off, but had to talk her down before she burst into tears in the bridal salon. 

Like, I had to kneel in front of her and talk to her the way you would to someone really young getting upset and shutting down and tell her that my decision to put art on my body was not one that was made with the intention to hurt her feelings at ALL, that I still love her and nothing would change that, etc etc etc. 

While wearing a wedding dress. On a day that should have been happy and fun for me, I had to devote all my energy to trying to keep my mother from getting upset. She took one of the few times I've ever wanted all the attention on myself and made it about her feeling personally attacked because I had a tattoo. 

For the record, I'm 24 years old and have been living on my own for four years. I got engaged a month and a half ago to my boyfriend of four and a half years. I'm almost done a two year program in college, that I paid for myself by working my ass off and taking out student loans because my parents wouldn't/couldn't pay for me to go to school. 

Like... for fuck's sakes. 

She then managed to somehow convince me to spend an extra $100 on lace that matched the dress I bought (my exmo grandma having gifted me with paying for half the cost of my dress, ahh) to have a bolero shrug made to match the dress. So I could cover my tattoo on my wedding day. 

At the time I didn't say anything about it, but the more I think about it, the more irritated I am with her for guilting me. 

She's still my mom and I love her, but holy fuck. Gah.

This thread is pretty much- 

FGM is wrong and should be stopped.

I agree.

Hey guys, MGM is still happening and not just in third world countries, but it's extremely common in the first world countries as well, and no one really seems to be interested in ending it.

Well, it's not as bad as FGM so it's irrelevant, stop trying to derail this thread.

Well, I'm aware that there are degrees of severity but the two topics are both related to the mutilation of childrens genitals, so maybe we could discuss both.

No, FGM removes the clitoris, so unless male circumcision removes the whole head of the penis, we've nothing to discuss. Go start your own thread."

I'm used to my more liberal friends/acquaintances being very closed to the idea of discussing how the supply of labour force affects wages. They'll talk about *anything* else to avoid that. Greedy corporations, gov't, conservatives, etc. And I used to just automatically agree, but there's a point where intellectual integrity has to come through.

Women entering the workforce does drive down wages. It can help society in many ways, but let's not pretend it doesn't. Immigration also drives down wages in many ways (I've been an immigrant to multiple countries and there's always pressure to avoid this angle by other immigrants for obvious reasons). Too many people going to college means there's an over-supply of educated labourers, and yet the economy still needs roughnecks.

Everyone certainly has the right to try. It's just reality that not everyone can nor should get everything they want. And these things should still be discussed frankly and openly in a democracy without cries of bigotry."

I think it's entirely possible some communities might find it in their interest to live in a communist setting and some communities might find it in their best interest to live in a propertarian setting. 

Look up Bill Kauffman, I'm pretty much the same kind of thinker he is. I suppose I can identify as a sort of anarchist but not in the traditional leftist sense of wanting to abolish all hierarchy but rather wanting to abolish the nation-state and all its destruction of human flourishing and return to a system of local life and law and give the middle finger to capitalism (as Marx and the Pope understand it) and its destruction of dignified economic life in favor of a genuinely freed market. I'm basically un-classifiable. It sucks.

Income inequality is at historical highs, and we seem to be in for a long-term stretch of high unemployment. So yes, they should be worried. Your dimmer rich people, like the Kochs, think they can survive without making any concessions at all to the working class, so as usual, it falls to the Democrats to keep capitalism alive by promoting said concessions.

And in doing so, they'll attempt to bring people who might otherwise turn to socialism back into the neoliberal fold."

So what started as two genetically different siblings became one person with different DNA sets for different organs.

As with any group of people, the loud and irritating are the ones who stick out- so the ones we really remember are the ones that are regularly wasting everyone's time telling anecdotes as some bizarre segue into a barely relevant question or connection with the topic. Talking about your husband or your cats or whatever with other classmates in times *other* than lectures where many of us want to absorb as much information as we can from the expert we're paying to teach us about it. And it's great that you called someone out for that type of behaviour, but that shit is really not nearly as kosher coming from a 18-20 year old ""punk kid"", as it is from someone that they naturally perceive as an actual peer.

That said, you're kind of doing the same thing when you act like younger students aren't keenly aware of the money being siphoned out of our pockets to gain an education. Sure, some people are shitheads and don't seem to care about the real reason everyone's in the classroom, but I'd like to think that those are probably also the minority in most classrooms among young people, they're just also the most annoying and loud people from their own segment of the population.

CAN_ZIGZAG,shittyaskscience,1391141353.0,"Sorry to say this is not like a 24 hr cleanse... this process takes about 3 weeks. 

Step 1.  Eat nothing but whole wheat bran bread for about 4 days.  And drink nothing but water at this time... take your last poop for about 2.5 weeks!

Step 2.  Every hour on the hour for about 2.5 weeks eat nothing but half a dozen of those bakery fresh cinnamon rolls you are talking about.  If you are tired of water you can now switch to strong coffee! 

Step 3.  By this time you may take your first poop... you might now start get the results you are looking (smellng) for!

ClimbingWolfBear,swoleacceptance,1391141530.0,"I have had those same problems speaking in public. There are really two way to do it:

1. Practice your speech until you can't get it wrong. Don't just practice what you're going to say, practice how your tone will change, your pitch, your gestures, practice when you're going to breathe and when you will insert dramatic pauses. When you stand up to speak, no matter how nervous you are, you can go on autopilot and execute. 

2. Get lost in your story. Find something in your speech to be excited about. Create a passion for your subject. Then all you have to do is tell that story just like you would to your best friend. 

While both of these help, they require a lot of practice. Think of it as exercising a new muscle. Maybe you start by only speaking well for 30 seconds to a 30 person class. But soon, you'll gain new PRs. 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes. After that, you're giving full lectures. 

Good luck to you. "
