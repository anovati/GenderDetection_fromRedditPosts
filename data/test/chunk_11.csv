i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1388957443.0,"I'm extremely critical in general, both in my friendships in men and women, and my potential relationships with men. For some reason, I just cannot do it unless they meet a certain criteria. It's unfortunate for me, because it means less friends and less options in general. I just will be miserable unless I am very selective.

For men, I take consideration into: their looks, their style (how they present themselves--are they a beer chugging party-goer? are they a neckbeard who thinks they're a ""nice guy"", are they a sports fanatic, are they an academic type?), their sense of humor (I like self-depreciating humor, as well as ""dad-jokes"", like puns, I like deadpan humor, and I like awareness humor, like ""you ever notice how...""). I pay attention to if his interests are compatible with mine, I pay attention to how he holds a conversation with me. I tend to enjoy people who don't give a shit about putting on a front; I like openness, expressiveness, and sincerity. I like people who smile a lot, but are also slightly cynical.

alettertoelise7,AskReddit,1388957497.0,"I worked for Hooters about 10 years ago. I never saw direct malicious behavior, but there were cleanliness issues. In this particular restaurant girls took orders, prepared and delivered drinks, delivered food, and bussed their own tables, along with taking trash cans to the back of the house. Now, you really should be washing hands between all these activities... in reality, it was nothing for a girl to put her hands on lemons for tea, take it to a table, clear dishes from another table, overflow the trash can and haul it to the back, then hurry to the window and grab plates to carry to a table. Repeat. Dirty fingers get on the top of plates and in the outter food when trying to balance several plates up your arms. Cross contamination everywhere.  Not all waitresses are like this, but be realistic about some of the people serving your food. They don't care. 


Also, as it is stated SO many times in stories on here: odds are pretty good that sometimes the person serving your food is sick and couldn't/wasn't allowed to call in sick. They don't want to be there and they don't want to share their illness, but calling in results in punishment or losing the job. Money and the company rules &gt; the workers and customer safety. "

We have a lot in common with our families, but those similarities cause us to harp on the differences instead--and those differences tend to be fairly small quirks and things that fester and eventually accumulate into bigger hostility.

What I find most interesting is the comparison of family conflict at holidays to civil wars/hostility between countries of relatively similar peoples that happen to be nearby each other and thus exposed to one another pretty often. Even if the countries' cultures have a lot of the same values, people try to differentiate themselves by focusing on the differences, and they often let the differences define the relationships."

I'm glad to say I've never acted like this in my relationship &amp; anyone who does deserves a slap (man or woman).

Sometimes I do loads of shit &amp; my boyfriend does none, sometimes he does loads and I sit back. Equality isn't all the time, I'd say 'balanced' is a more fitting term. Yesterday I was in hospital all afternoon getting tests, so he sat with me and then bought me dinner afterwards. Today I felt better so WE did housework and DIY and I made him pancakes. 

I have a fucked hip, so I can never lift or carry stuff but I love cooking &amp; he hates it. So yeh, we don't share that. But in terms of finance, plans, driving, decisions, we share them. But then again, it can change.

Sometimes we go somewhere I really wanted to go.. so we will do stuff I have chosen. Other times he will choose the activities. I was made redundant a few months ago, so yes he has picked up the tab a little more, but last year when he was a student &amp; I was earning loads I got the car fixed and taxed, and paid for more dates/meals.

It's all about finding a happy balance. Sometimes you'll find a guy who wants to pay for everything, sometimes you'll find a girl who adores cooking and cleaning. It's not as black and white as you make it out."

Believing in something means very little if your explicit and implicit actions are contrary to those beliefs.  Forcing someone to support, financially or otherwise, a system that actively violates their beliefs is wrong regardless of the goal you're attempting to achieve.

These people are not just members of a ""single religion,"" either.  Even if you lumped every Protestant and Catholic together and called them all Christians, there are others, even some atheists, who oppose abortion on moral grounds.

No one is suggesting giving these people ""significant influence"" over government, but at the same time we recognize that government does not need such significant influence over them that it should be able to compel them with threat of force to violate the edicts of their moral and/or ethical code(s).  If we decided to ""follow suit"" here, we'd end up with some of the same silly shenanigans you have that most of us would prefer to avoid, like the internet pornography filter silliness of the past few weeks.

I have a purpose in life. Love the people close to me, be a nice person in general and try to enjoy it to the fullest. It's the meaning I give to it myself.

I actually find peace in knowing that life will be like it was before we were born. I never suffered from not existing before I was born, and I'm pretty certain I won't suffer from it after I die either.

To me, the thought of existing in a conscious state for *eternity* is a lot more frightening than the idea I'll simply seize to exist. Think about what it implies, eternity. You'll exist for as long as you can imagine, and then infinitely longer. What if I get sick of it? What if I don't want to be in heaven anymore? I don't get an option to opt out? I'll have to stay there for ever? That sounds more like hell than like heaven to me.

EDIT: also, could  you please stop being such a disrespectful asshole all the time? If I treat you with respect, why don't you give me the same courtesy? You're not making yourself look very good."

Almost all of the developed world took Iraq's side. Its largest weapons suppliers were France, the USSR, and China. Its largest financial backers were Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and (ironically) Kuwait. Germany and France supplied much of the technology and supplies used to build the chemical weapons Saddam used on Iran and the Kurds. 

The US gets a lot of flack for supporting Saddam. Although the US did support Iraq in that conflict, so did most of the world. Many countries provided much more support to Saddam than the US, and virtually never get mentioned (just go search /r/todayilearned). 

The US also set up and enforced a no-fly zone over the Kurdish region, which they seem to vividly remember. The behind the scenes politics probably mean a lot less than actual actions when people are dropping chemical weapons on your home."

It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means you will survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleek and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keeping you from leaping off the motherfreaking deep end
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willing
To forgive them even after all that shit you been put through.
This feeling of resilience is building.
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building you're sealed in
But you're fireproof, and flame retardant you withstood it.

mrpoopistan,PurplePillDebate,1388958075.0,"As someone who's pretty well-read in TRP, let me outline the issues.

First off, a decent amount of the initial TRP attraction for most guys is butthurt. Let's be honest, no one advocates this radically for changing their own worldview without being hurt. It's just not human.

Even a personal revolution has to have its incipient moment. Every revolution is at its core an act of butthurt anguish.

&gt; ""where does the constant insistence that getting laid is easy for women come from""

OMFG! You haven't been to a bar in quite a while, have you? 

Observation. It's a simple fact. The odds that you will see an attractive dude hanging on an ugly chick are much higher than seeing an attractive chick hanging on a low status guy.

&gt; ""fertility"" and ""the wall"" are recurring themes

Google the charts for the decline in fertility rates from age 16 to age 40 in women.

The simple fact is that human mating is at the base of it about stamping out more humans.

&gt; On the other hand, TRP teaches that men basically have their attractiveness in their own hands, pretty much anyone can become an alpha and start banging hot 18 year olds, right? As long as they swallow the red pill.

1) It's important to disambiguate the PUA marketing bullshit from the bigger conversation. That's hard, obviously, because there's a lot of history there. I'm not even really sure it's possible.

The buy-my-book guys selling that bullshit are a major problem that TRP types need to address before moving forward. I don't see that ever happening, and it will remain one of the major indictments against TRP.

2) I don't think ""men can change their attractiveness"" precludes the notion that women can't do the same. 

Studies of sociopathy in women strongly indicate that sociopathic women do an incredibly good job of using clothes, makeup, posture, and social status to achieve a greater appearance of attractiveness. Also, let's be honest: lots of women lie about their age. That's not an accident.

Really, how is a woman getting in shape and using makeup any different than a man upping his game? It isn't, except that women tend to do a better job of threading the needle of society's approval, pimping their efforts as ""self-improvement"". TRP has tried the self-improvement angle, but this many young guys clammering for pussy is bound to degenerate quickly into ""OMG! GIRLS!!!1!"" quickly.

 - - -

I'd recommend you pick up the evo-bio book The Red Queen and give it a full read (if you can't stand the early stuff about non-human sex, just skip halfway through and start where humans come into the narrative). The Red Queen is, by far, the best reasoned and least judgmental version of TRP, although it does wobble a bit on the line between speculation and science."

&gt; Are there any women here who identify as lesbians* but still own male slaves / pets?

I scened at a few play parties with a woman who identified as lesbian. We talked about it sometimes, and for her, it seemed like a ""labels work for me, I don't work for labels"" kind of thing. ""Lesbian"" felt right to her, for a number of reasons, among them that she had only ever felt romantic or physical attraction to women, and she didn't feel the need to modify it based on indulging in kink with a male.

I asked her if playing with me turned her on--as is the wont of the male submissive, of course... nothing gets us going more than knowing our partners are getting off on making us squirm!--and she always seemed rather uncertain. I got the impression that the enjoyment she got out of our play was sexual in nature, but didn't ""turn her on"" in the way that getting sexy with a female partner did.

The imbalance was strange at first, because it was *absolutely* sexual for me, and it turned me on just like playing with any other female partner. I never physically stimulated her, but my genitals were fair game, so there was some stroking/edging/pain play involved.

At first I felt kind of guilty because I didn't really understand what she was getting out of it. It was actually her girlfriend  (also a submissive) who finally assuaged my concerns: she mentioned that recounting our kinky hijinks was now a semi-frequent part of their foreplay, which they had been struggling with.

Since I am such a generous fellow, I was happy to take one for the team and rest well knowing that I was a catalyst for them to get worked up over and eventually slake their lust on each other. Life's hard for us submissives... 

(*That last paragraph was facetious, in case it wasn't clear...* ;-P)

To be completely honest, I was still sometimes a little jealous or disappointed that tormenting me didn't ""turn her on"" so to speak, but I never felt the need to bring it up to either of them. We had a **lot** of fun and only played a few times, so it was worth it.

---

&gt; Are there any male subs who could imagine being in this sort of relationship?

OK. Bear with me here. I don't know how I feel about it off the top of my head, so come with me on a stream-of-consciousness tangent while I try to figure it out.

While very fun, the experience I had with a similar arrangement was decidedly *not* romantic and not emotional beyond the ""close friends/fwb/play partners"" level.

As for what you are describing, I'm of two minds about it. On the one hand, it seems great! (""Two chicks at once, right dude? HIGH FIVE, BRO!"")

But, I would be worried that the benign jealousy from a lack of ""real"" mutual sexual connection could evolve into an actual problem when things get emotional.

Then again, years ago, I never really got to *see* or experience the sexy stuff that was supposedly catalyzed by my enthusiastic suffering. I'm getting pretty hypothetical now, but now that I think about it, it seems pretty plausible that the dissonance would resolve itself: in a more romantic/emotional/committed relationship, the experience of mutual satisfaction would be more important, but everyone would also be more comfortable with new levels of involvement in sexual play. Heck, you definitely mentioned the submissive guy being directly involved in a lot of ways, including even potentially having sex with your girlfriend while you watch.

That sounds much more sustainable to me, and it intuitively makes sense. Bigger connection, bigger pool of possibilities for the kinds of activities that everyone participates in, bigger list of ways for the submissive to feel like he's really providing enjoyment and satisfaction on parity with what he himself is experiencing.

Maybe it's not as big of a deal for others, but when I first got into BDSM, I was a very self-centered ""do me"" kind of submissive, so it's something I look out for now.

---

&gt; What would be important to you? What things do you think should be negotiated beforehand?

Expectations. Expectations, expectations, expectations. I mean, let's face it, very few people know what they are going to want from someone 10 years from now. But I believe that pretty much all modern relationships suffer from a lack of communication of expectations. Not just because communication is hard, but because it's often difficult to determine what our own expectations are in the first place!

So I think it would behoove you and your partner to sit down and talk about your expectations and your desires. For example: you've clearly thought a lot about the sexual details, but what about the other stuff? You two are presumably already happy with your relationship and the amount of time you spend together. Here are some questions to consider:

* How much time do you want to make sure is reserved for just the two of you?

* How many non-sexual activities do you want to share with the guy?

* How will you handle potential romance? This is just a remote possibility, but it's worth talking about for 5 minutes up front. How will you feel if both of you get attached to him and he only feels the spark with one of you? How will you feel if he wants to move in with you and become a ""triad""? Like I said, these are just vague possibilities. It's not worth *planning* for them, but it's worth imagining so you're not completely blindsided if they happen.

* Would you want the guy to be sexually exclusive to both of you--that is, he does not have sexual contact with anyone else?

* Would you want the guy to be kink exclusive to both of you--that is, he does not play with anyone else? If he's a switch, how would you feel about him topping someone at a play party, but only being submissive to you?

* How do each of you feel about the other hanging out alone with him? (Going to the movies, cuddling, etc.)

* How do each of you feel about the other having sex or playing alone with him?

Anyway, I hope some of this was edifying to you. I apologize for the long-windedness, and I wish you the best of luck finding the right guy! Frankly, it sounds like an arrangement that I could see myself being involved with, especially if your girlfriend is as articulate and thoughtful as your writing indicates you to be! :-) If you're near New York City, feel free to send me a PM."

""You think there's something wrong with her?""  
""Well, I just wouldn't want to see you miss out on something that would really make you happy, but if you just want to settle for something...""

She made an active effort to make sure I *didn't* get into other relationships.  I'm pretty she broke it off with the fat guy because I mentioned talking to one of her friends and how I was thinking of asking her out.

Oh, and you know how people who say the friendzone doesn't exist, and that if you were *really* friends with someone, you would be friends with them whether they wanted to have sex with you or not?

Yeah, she pulled that shit on me to.  The first two times I wanted to just walk away because I was tired of feeling hurt and dejected all the time, and I was stressed out from the constant hot and cold signals, and from the intense emotional intimacy, she pulled that ""Well then I guess we were never really friends and you were just trying to use me for sex"" shit on me.

SublethalDose,cpp,1388958307.0,"The comments from de Icaza were too vague to generate a meaningful conversation, so this is what we get instead.  The observations seem to point to de Icaza launching a major C++ project without having a sufficient knowledge of C++, but how do we really know?  What is the purpose of this?  I think Bjarne Stroustrup set an excellent example in the early history of C++ (at least based on his account) in which he worked closely with people who attempted major projects in C++ so he could find out what difficulties they had and why they did or didn't succeed.  If Moonlight is full of shitty C++, then *why?*  That's a difficult conversation to have in public, where people are defensive about their skills and their favorite technologies.  Sniping like this only makes it harder.

C++ is very, very different from most languages used today in terms of the level of knowledge and sophistication required to run a project.  C++ was my primary language from 2003-2011, but having been away from C++ for several years now, I would spend a week or two refreshing and updating my knowledge before writing a single line of production code.  I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of adopters jump in too quickly and manage to implement most of a big project before they really get a feel for the fundamentals of C++, leaving them with a valuable codebase that is painful to work with but too expensive to fix.  That's a problem for C++, but it should be approached as an education problem, not a blame-casting problem.

If I get a compliment about my breasts (from a good friend or SO. Strangers and acquaintances would just be really, really creepy) or eyes or face, awesome. It makes me feel good for a couple minutes, but in the end, they're just there. It's not something I have any control over, so it's not where my self-esteem comes from. 

It's not like I get insulted when people tell me they like my eyes or I have great boobs (again, good friends or SO). It still makes me feel good. But if nobody ever said those things to me again, I wouldn't really miss it, because those are not the things I value the most about myself."

You probably won't be able to find his prostate unless he is very aroused (which is why you are giving him the blow job). As a rough guide of where it is -- you should just be able to reach it with the tip of your index or middle finger.

Another option: have him lie on his side, back toward you. With your hand, gently stroke down between his cheek, over his anal opening, over his perineum, and then cup his balls, then trail your hand back up the way you came.

I would certainly not buy a bike at this time of year.  We have a lot of snow on the ground, and Calgary is a moderately difficult city to travel by bike in even perfect conditions.  The Transit network is quite decent to get you to anywhere that you would need to go, a C-Train station stops right at the university and will give you access to the rest of the network.

Weekends...  I would recommend at least once getting out to the mountains, Banff, Canmore and/or Lake Louise are all close and are all beautiful.  If you enjoy downhill skiing you could try any number of the mountains in those areas, and if you prefer cross country skiing there is a great facility just outside of Canmore (it's actually the facility that held the nordic events for the 1988 Olympics).  If you are not going to drive yourself, I would recommend looking into the University Outdoor Centre   http://www.calgaryoutdoorcentre.ca/ they will rent you gear, teach lessons and will sometimes arrange for carpools and the like.

As for food, I second the comment made about the selection at Mac Hall, it's not too bad and is reasonably cheap.  The Chinatown area downtown has some good and cheap Vietnamese and Chinese noodle type places...  A lot of this will depend on where you are going to be staying.

I don't know how ""numerous"" these surveys are that are finding so many women have been raped, but if they're all using bad methodology it's no wonder they're all getting the same result.  I notice that you ignore the critique I linked and attempted to pile on by adding ""numerous"" nebulous unnamed/unlinked studies, but in a lot of the studies that come up with such startling accounts of the prevalence rape, something along the lines of the following happens:

&gt; The ambiguous nature of the questions and inclusive definition of rape is evident from the following statistics.  Only 27 percent of the women Koss counted as having been raped identified themselves as rape victims.  Moreover, 42 percent of labeled rape victims, went on to have sex with their attackers at a later date.  Clearly, something is wrong.  If we just consider women who considered themselves to be raped, the figure falls to a more believable 1/14. 

While we're clearly defining what is and isn't acceptable, let's not just pile all the responsibility/accountability at the feet of men.  Women are adults, too, and should be treated accordingly.  The rest of us, men and women alike, shouldn't have to resort to filling out forms in triplicate pre-coitus, during coitus, and post coitus to indemnify ourselves because some of you don't want to take responsibility for your choices."

Ever since I was little, maybe 5 or 6, I would just hang out underneath bridges. I would sit there for hours, and if someone wandered by, I would say hello and carry on a polite conversation with them.

However, when i turned 15, I was under my favorite bridge (The bridge was a cisethnic trans dragon otherkin named Sam, so we got along well) and I heard a passerby go above me. I stepped out to say my usual hello, but he instead pulled out a knife and demanded everything. My wallet, ipod, backpack, clothes. Everything. Ever since then, I treat all passerbys as cruelly as I can because I know that they maybe probably sometimes want to rob me.

But please tolerate me, this is just a cry for help from other ledditors :)"

There's an implicit understanding that the religious beliefs need to be shielded from mockery because they don't stand up on their own against it."

iheartaegislash,TruePokemon,1388958588.0,"TL;DR - (Put at the top to make it easier) - hacking in otherwise legit pokemon is usually viewed as ok (not by me though,) getting move-sets that aren't otherwise obtainable was never acceptable.

Depends on how you define it. Using something that was not legitimately obtained, but could be obtained, a lot of people don't consider it cheating. Based on his argument, I think OP does consider that cheating. So using RNG abuse or a pokemon creator to get something with the perfect IV's/nature you want with the right hidden power, etc. a lot of people have no problem with. Things like hacking wonderguard onto a spiritomb (no real weaknesses before fairy) I think was never acceptable, and still isn't.

With all of that being said, using RNG abuse or a pokemon creator is definitely less acceptable now than it ever was. Gamefreak put a lot of things into the game that make it much easier to do all of this than it ever has been. It still is incredibly difficult and there is still a huge learning curve, but it is a lot easier now with the destiny knot, everstone guaranteeing a nature pass-down, ditto friend safaris with guaranteed 2 IVs, etc.

For me personally, I really don't care if people use those techniques to get pokemon as long as they don't try to trade them as legit. I spent multiple days breeding to get my team, but I know others don't have that kind of time, so I'm not offended when others do it as long as they aren't claiming they are legit. I feel the same way about the SV thing being able to get any shiny whenever you want. If you want competitive shiny pokemon you don't have much of a choice?

I apologize if this didn't make any sense..."

I believe in the right to own guns but I also believe with rights come responsibilities. We need to have more restrictions on sales and ownership. That's a debate for another time however. If the gun rights advocates want to avoid blanket bans then they need to be the ones to step forward and talk sane reforms that don't involve bans instead. Talk responsible ownership and they'll manage to win over a lot of people on both sides. I have witnessed first hand that when I fully conveyed my ideas on gun reforms I've had people on both sides agree with me. This middle ground needs more attention.

If both partners have sterilisation surgery you have a 1% chance of conceiving and yet it happens. 

Women get their tubes tied but no surgery is perfect so mistakes can happen but even if they don't your body can grow new passage ways to get those eggs into your uterus. Men too can have spontaneous reconnection of a vas deferens or an opening in one end that allows sperm to mix with the semen again.

The only 100% method of not getting pregnant while having sex is if both parties are 100% sterile even then people are diagnosed as ""barren"" or ""sterile"" when they really just have very low chances of conceiving naturally.

by_a_pyre_light,Dallas,1388959028.0,"Gloria's and Mi Cocina serve pretty decent Mexican food. They are both right off the tollway in Addison. You can also try Uncle Julio's, and they have numerous locations. These places are all a little more upscale, with slightly more expensive dishes ($13-$19 average plate). For a good alternative at a lower price Chuy's, El Fenix, and On The   Border feature good Tex Mex. My other suggestion would be to look for authentic hole in the wall Mexican restaurants on Yelp, because there are some hidden gems. 

Also, we have a lot of street taco places here, where tacos run about a buck each, so you can get authentic street tacos and load up on them for cheap. 

I cannot say enough good stuff about Torchy's Tacos, and they have 3 locations in DFW. An original Austin establishment, they expanded to DFW about 3-4 years ago with one store and have opened another two so far. My best recommendation is to get the Dirty Sanchez and Trailer Park, ""extra trashy"". These are ***loaded*** street-style tacos with crazy good fillings. 2 will usually fill you up, 3 if you're *reaaally* hungry. Any more and you will slip into a food coma you may not recover from. 

OTOH, I am not a big fan of Fuzzy's Tacos. They're not had, they're just hardly worth all the hype people ascribe them. They're mainly famous because of their name (hurr hurr) and the fact that they started in college towns has only further spread that fame. 

I *highly* recommend checking out The Iron Cactus right in the center of downtown Dallas for their brunch buffet specials on Sunday. It's ~$14/person, at a nice, upcale 3-4 star place, with a great selection of Tex Mex favorites, breakfast items and fruit, and an omellete(sp?) station where the chef will prepare an omelette to your specifications. On top of this, they feature bottomless mimosas for like $5. 

This makes it one of the cheapest brunches anywhere, at one of the arguably best locations, with excellent food.

You can get some really nice wide intervals out of string skipping, 6ths, 7ths, octaves, 9ths and 10ths are often used.

If you're not familiar with those numbers, it just means degree of the scale the notes are apart. If you play the first note of a scale and then the 6th, it's an interval of a 6th. If you play the second note of a scale, it's still an interval of a 6th. Additional naming criteria is used for 'types' of these intervals, which I would happily expand on if you like."

From what I've heard around campus it's going to be designed that all the noise we make in the student section is going to bounce back in the stadium and make the loudest stadium in the nation, louder.

Every 17 year old has a long and difficult road ahead of them, and things they thought they were going to do, almost always end up changing. If you have a child, it's not impossible to continue with school and go on making a name and good life for yourself. But it will not come as easy as your peers, and you can NEVER give up. It means no raunchious college parties, but rather staying home with your loved little one and doing homework. It means tons of sleepless nights working late at a side job while working your butt through school. But if you stay strong and never give up, you can still build a good life for yourself.

And on the other hand, if you are wanting an abortion, there is nothing wrong with *you* if you feel that's the best decision for you and your family's future, it is **ok**. It's not easy, and it will be hard. Make sure you have support and see a counselor and talk it through to trusted people. Whenever you do end up having a child, that child's time has come.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388959302.0,"Well you see, that's how YOU spin it. I think passive coercion is almost as bad as active coercion. Here's the thing. Most libertarians have major issues with ""men and guns"" ""taking"" their property away, but they have no problem with the fact that property rights inherently favor elites, and society is structured in a way that favors the elites. For example, our employment system isn't much different than serfdom of old. It's just a matter of methods. Serfdom was enforced more actively with dissenters actually physically punished, while elites nowadays use the passive weapons of starvation. When you base a society around scarcity and use it as ""motivation"", then you're actually using scarcity as a weapon.

So yes, it is a meaningless distinction.

Learn to see society through the eyes of a sociologist. Question our rules, norms, and how everything is structured. You'll see that this libertarian philosophy is just a front meant to legitimize the vast riches of the ruling elite. It portrays the rules of the game as ""fair"", and make it sound like the rich ""deserve"" their wealth. Little do you seem to realize the rules of the game are rigged. 

Look at our economy as if it were a game of monopoly. What chance do you have if they have a hotel on every property?

Or let's look at it this way, and this is a major problem with the job market right now. As you know, jobs are scarce. So you apply for a job, and then you get to the point of discussing conditions and pay. How much leverage do you have? Well, unless it's a job in a specialized field, not a whole lot. You're not really given much of a choice in how things go. You're given an ultimatum...take it or leave it. Why? Because you're expendable, and because you need that job more than they need you. Why? Because they have all the property, and you have nothing to fall back on. So you accept the job, not because the conditions are really favorable, but because all your other options are bad. And you know what? You would argue they ""agreed"" to accept those wages, that the transaction is ""voluntary"", and that it's perfectly fair. And honestly, the only thing stopping conditions from being worse, ie, lower pay, longer worker hours, less safe environment, etc., is government regulation. 

What libertarians are REALLY for, whether they realize it or not, admit to it or not, is a society that recognizes the rich's property rights, but doesn't regulate the rules of the game, so the elites can structure it in whatever way they want. I don't know if you've noticed, but the last I looked, businesses are a lot like governments. They might not have the formal ""men with guns"" to back it up, but they rely on social convention (which is backed up with men with guns), and impose a lot of rules on you about what you do with your time and your life. And while you can technically walk away, when society is structured in a way you have no better options, then good luck with that.

And if you're an ancap, you're really going off the deep end because while you dont have any government, you still have men with guns with those so called ""rights enforcement agencies"", aka, mafias, if the businesses don't take it up themselves to be the men with guns in order to enslave people. You realize that this is the way things were for centuries right? That we recognized the ability for human beings to own other human beings, right? And ultimately, we needed ""men with guns"", ie, the government, to put a stop to it.

You're always gonna have men with guns somewhere. And quite frankly, while we can argue over the specifics, I still maintain that while it isn't perfect, I have more trust in the US government than any proposed solution coming from libertarians. Honestly, the issue with me is over policy. What policies should these men with guns enforce? And I think they should enforce those beneficial to its populace at large, rather than a few ruling elites. As far as I'm concerned, men with guns is a reality we have to deal with. The real question is how can we use this force to attain the most favorable outcome for society. Honestly, libertarianism comes off as a combination of naivety about how the world works, as well as anti government teenage angst. The actual arguments for it are very flimsy and once sided, and often times promoted by questionable sources (ie, think tanks funded by lots of corporate donations). Honestly, I don't think the ""Tea Peter"" family guy episode is that far off the mark in this respect with Carl Pewterschmidt posing as ""Joe Working Man."""

Example: why were people willing to take time to drive to Blockbuster and spend money and risk late fees for every single movie rental until a few years ago, but we're *not* all willing to instantly rent an HD download on the iTunes store/Amazon, for cheaper?  (""dude you can just torrent it."").

Because here's how I think it could work:  the company who designed the cable-comb can just sell the 3d file on an online marketplace for people to print at home.  In reality, they should be able to sell MORE stuff to MORE people, all the time, with less overhead.  And everyone at home is getting more stuff, better, stuff, for cheaper.

sorator,AdviceAnimals,1388959361.0,"(Disclaimer: I'm sitting in the psychology armchair, and kind of giving the advice I wish folks had given me years ago, so it may or may not be relevant. I figure it's worth typing anyway.)

You're likely introverted and prone to depression. You need to be away from large groups of people most of the time (though you can probably do parties now and then, they're not the most enjoyable experience and you can't do them *often* and need recharge time afterward). However, you also need distractions so that you don't just start stewing in your depression. That can be difficult.

If you're prone to worrying, or stressing, or generally thinking in negative patterns about things, then you can set a timer on that and just refuse to keep doing that after your time is up. Sounds corny, but it works surprisingly well - if you find yourself thinking negative when you shouldn't be, then you just guide your thoughts back to something else instead. Don't get overly frustrated when this happens; it *will* happen a lot at first, but by stopping when you realize you're doing it, you're retraining your mind and establishing better thought patterns and habits.

Also recognize that there's a difference between feeling *sad*, *feeling* depressed, and *having* depression. Those are all different things, and while they *can* overlap, they're still different. Basically, feeling sad is normal to an extent, especially if you have a reason to be sad, but if you aren't also sometimes feeling happy, then there's a problem. Feeling depressed actually feels quite different from feeling sad; it involves more apathy and lethargy than normal sadness. If you're feeling that way often, to the extent that it interferes with your daily life (even if it's just in episodes, as long as they're regularly occurring and not just once or twice in your life), *then* you likely have depression.

Likewise, there's a difference between productive problem-solving/brainstorming and unproductive worrying. If you're actually thinking about reasonable things you can do to deal with whatever is worrying you, then that's identifying and planning potential solutions, and that's fine. If you're just stuck in the cycle of ""oh my gosh why is this going wrong what am I gonna do,"" *that's* not productive and needs to be limited. (Also note that even productive planning can become problematic, if it keeps you from doing other things you need to do.)

For me, I need the distractions (books, video games, movies, friends who like to talk a lot) to kick myself out of the worry-cycle and to prevent from falling back into it. I do something that I can tune in and out of very rapidly, so that I can start working through the issue in my head, and then switch to killing dragons or whatever if I start worrying, and then after a bit switch back to ""check in"" on my state of mind and mood. That gets me through the worst of it, usually; then later, when my mood has somewhat improved/I've stopped freaking out, I can actually sit down and work on the problem and come up with a solution. And then I **stop thinking about it** until I can act on that solution, or something comes up such that I need to change my plan.

And as /u/droopymushrooms said, it really helps to find one or two or three people that you can spend time with who don't overly stress you. It's hard, and they're kind of rare to find; I think I have about three people like that in my life right now (one of my suitemates, another guy from college, and my dad) with about two others that might reach that point if we can spend more time together. I'm lucky in that I have a very strong intuition about people, and I notice folks who seem like a good fit and make a mental note to spend more time with them if at all possible. If you can't spot folks that easily, then yeah, it's gonna be harder. :\

Regardless of all else, bathe/shower at least once a week, try to eat at least twice a day (junk food is better than literally nothing, but not by much; buy some sandwich supplies), and try to step outside at least every other day. It sucks; I know. I'm going through a really rough time myself right now, so believe me, I know.

And even if nothing I've said applies to you at all (because I'm assuming a *lot* based on a meme xD), here: have a hug."

But . . . we'd be a lot further ahead to stop scaring black and brown guys into the feminists' camp -- where they really do not fit in at all -- than to keep pushing them away.

I'm not a rightie, and that's just that. But the right in America is up against pure fucking math. They've lost the Cuban vote ferfucksake! And that boils down to the astonishing number of old white men who treat minority members like shit no matter what they do. Look at the failure of the right to obtain the Asian vote, who should easily be swayed by the anti-tax and givers-vs-takers argument. That's not an accident -- that's years of white males treating Asian males like shit.

Democracy is a numbers game, and the simple fact is that the right is engaged in a delaying action that it cannot win without recruiting allies outside of its traditional white base. The simplest solution is to begin appealing to non-white men, to simply push the political argument in America toward boys vs girls instead of white guys vs everyone else."

Nah.  I've been in this situation before without even realizing it.  A woman claimed she was raped by a guy when (I later realized) the evidence pointed to her willingly having sex with him.  

I pushed her to talk to a college official about it.  She dragged her heels and came up with reasons why she didn't want to, but I held her hand (metaphorically) through the entire process.

jackiebird,explainlikeimfive,1388959460.0,"There are ""soundproof"" apartments but they aren't as common.  And the soundproofing doesn't usually come from a design choice directly for that, but it's more a extra feature of apartments that are built to be fireproof (if a fire starts in one unit, it won't spread to another).  It's usually accomplished by concrete and masonry in the walls between units, rather than the more common plain drywall.

I used to live [here](http://www.gebhartproperties.com/Residential/Briarcliff_East/Overview.php), and in the second paragraph it describes it briefly.  We never heard anything from the apartments around us, and the people below us were a bunch of college kids having parties all the time.  The worst we ever had was we could occasionally hear the kids from the family across the hall practicing piano.

With this in mind, it's more a wonder that more apartment complex architects don't consider the safety aspects of this type of construction more than the comfort.  If one person leaves a burner on and starts a fire, it's not just one unit you've lost but potentially the whole building.  Then they're out how many hundreds or thousands of dollars to replace it all and possibly paying insurance fees to tenants.  That would be the larger concern for me if I was a complex owner.  But you usually have to look for upper-scale places or condos to get that sort of care.  Most med-low end apartment owners just worry about base cost of getting the place built and filled."

Ask a girl ""hey, do you have a penis size preference"" and most girls will lie and say it doesn't matter to them because they don't want to sound like a bitch. But if you are blunt with her about your situation, you will get a more honest reaction from her.

I do have personal experience with your issue (from the girl's side). He had a much smaller than average penis, and gave me absolutely no indication of this. When his pants came off, it was difficult for me to hide my shock and disappointment. What made it even more awkward is that he didn't say anything about the size even after he took his pants off, even though I'm pretty sure he could tell I was surprised. So it was just this elephant in the room that neither of us acknowledged. I ended up giving him a very half-hearted hand-job, he jerked himself to orgasm, and then I left his apartment. He continued to call/message me as if he were completely oblivious to what had happened, and I never saw him again.

I really wish he had given me some kind of advance warning. I'm sure it hurt him a great deal to see my reaction. We both would have been better off if he had told me before I saw it."

I grab it and its an alert from my Kings app. Quick is starting. I tell my son Quick is playing and he yells WOO HOO! Now we are jogging to get to our seats and see the applause he gets. We find our aisle and walk out and as we are making our way down the stairs to our seats they announce Quick. Staples Center went nuts. Everyone was pumped from that moment on.

miked4o7,pics,1388959643.0,"&gt;There's nothing inherently wrong with it. However, when atheists are upset about other religious people professing their religion they should be equally as upset about their fellow atheists doing it

Well that's where I might differ with lots of other atheists.  If I put myself in the shoes of some of the fundamentalist Christians, then I don't blame them for wanting to profess their religion.

Imagine if you truly believed that what you convinced or didn't convince your friends, family, and neighbors to believe could actually contribute to whether or not they spend an *eternity* in hell or bliss.  To a fundamentalist Christian, for example, hearing your child is gay is pretty much infinitely worse than finding out your child is addicted to heroin.  The former carries far graver consequences in their beliefs.

If we grant them that their beliefs are valid, then their actions that follow from them are actually pretty understandable and reasonable.  The problem is that their beliefs themselves are absolutely ridiculous and fly in the face of rational thought."

sorator,AdviceAnimals,1388959933.0,"&gt; I find it really difficult to talk to my parents, not because I don't trust them but because I don't want to disappoint them.

God, are you reading from my life's story? That's **exactly** what I've been dealing with for the past several years. They call to check up on me and I can't *say* that I haven't left the apartment in two weeks because I *cannot* disappoint them like that. Doesn't make logical sense but it still happens.

Eventually I sat down (with the help of a psychiatrist - if that's an option for you, **do it** and take the time to find a good one, even if it takes several tries; I can share about my experiences in that direction if you like) and worked out at least part of why that was such a massive block for me, and then got my dad to come up and talked with him about it (again, with my psychiatrist in the room). It hasn't fixed the problem, but it has at least made us both aware of what (one of) the problem(s) is, and we've made some changes that have helped.

For example: If he suggests something, he really just means it as a suggestion, but I hear it as an order. So, now he's more.. gentle? with his suggestions and makes it clear that they aren't orders, and I try to consciously remember that I'm of age and don't have to do what he tells me to just because he's telling me to do it.

It's especially bad with me because of some physical problems that went undiagnosed for years, which make movement and weight-bearing of any kind extremely painful, so when he told me to do chores, I'd say ""I can't,"" and he thought I was just being lazy so he made me do it anyway, and was accidentally torturing me. So I associated disagreeing with him on *anything* with extreme pain, and it's gonna take a while to undo that. (On top of the increasingly common general expectation to do well that turns into unnecessary pressure and stress instead of being helpful encouragement; that's definitely a factor as well.)"

A friend of mine and I are standing in line to see a midnight showing of *The Adventures of Buckaroo Bonzai**.  Cute as hell girl standing in line in front of us with her friend.  She's wearing an Evil Dead 2 shirt, which automatically knocks her into the top 1% of women I would like to score with.  I tell her that her shirt is cool.  We talk Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, Sam Raimi, B-Movies, insane movies we love, I mean this girl and I are seriously clicking and I'm like ""I think I'm going to get a date out of this conversation.""  

Then I mention that I love David Lynch's *Dune* and I'm about to give her my whole spiel on that movie and how even if its a poor adaption its a great movie on its own, and she's going to be like ""This guy is smart and witty and I am going to fuck him.""

""Dune sucks."" someone says.  Not her. Not my friend, who has been a perfect wingman and keeping the chick's friend distracted.  Not her friend, who apparently ha decided I was good enough for her friend.  Nope.  Giant, fat, butch haircut obvious lesbian further up the line.

I won't bore you with the details, but suddenly I had a heckler, trashing my opinion and calling me stupid.  And i froze up.  I was so fucking angry, but I knew I couldn't just go start punching this bitch.  But my mojo was gone.  I was afraid to open my mouth.  Hot girl just kind of half smiled, half shrugged and turned around again.  Opportunity lost.

**And By A ""Friend""**  
So I'm living in Prague, teaching English, drinking and partying a lot.  two hot chicks that teach at my school, a quiet English librarian and a brassy jewish princess from Brooklyn.  Both very different, both would make a good while-I'm-here girlfriend.  Decide to get to know them both better, invite them and some other co-workers out for drinks.

We get hammered, there is much flirting, and by the end of the evening I still don't know which one I like more, but it's fairly clear I have to pick one before anything can happen.  That's fine.

Heading home for the evening, catch the same bus as a male co-worker.  Good guy, consider him a friend.  A bro.  We're both drunk, in joyous spirits, had a great night with some lovely girls in one of the most beautiful cities on Earth.  Stuff of legends.  I am in high spirits, and feeling like one of god's favorite children.

He asks me if I think I'll hook up with either of them.  I, being a drunk and happy man, boastfully declare ""I'm going to fuck both of them, at the same time!  You just wait and see, I'm going to figure out how to pull this off.""  At the time, I totally believe it.

Next day at work, things are weird.  Neither girl is smiling at me.  Super frosty.  This goes on for a few days, and finally I ask another co-worker ""Why they being so frosty?""

My bro repeated the entire conversation to them in morning before I got to work.  With embellishments.  Apparently he thought it would help his chances with them (it didn't, just ruined mine).

That dude was a little bitch.  Still can't believe he did that."

But the porn addiction is a symptom of his compulsion to rape, not a cause of it. He watches rape porn because he enjoys raping. He doesn't enjoy raping because he watches rape porn.

What's more, it seems he has absolutely no remorse regarding his crimes. He continues to rape her daily, and lies to her and says that this is a 'sleeping fetish' so that she won't leave or go to the police. No amount of therapy or abstinence from porn is going to make him grow a conscience. He likes to rape, he knows it is wrong, he doesn't care that he is hurting his victim, and he is lying to her to avoid getting caught by the police. This guy is almost certainly a psychopath.

It is not possible to ever have a healthy relationship with someone who deliberately hurts you through physical/sexual violence on a daily basis without remorse. It doesn't matter if she wants to leave him or not -- she needs to leave him. And she has a duty to tell the police because this guy is clearly a danger to society. Not only is he highly likely to continue raping other women, but there are signs that his behaviour may escalate to homicide."

As an outsider (like the Aunt and Uncle) who don't know you *that* well, they're going to of course assume the worst. They care about their niece and want to protect her.

Instead of saying, ""What I did wasn't that bad!!!"" You apologize, own up to your mistake, and make actions to never have that happen again. My suggestion, don't drink for awhile. If you do, have your wife be there the whole time. Unless you show them that you're remorseful and don't want this to happen again (and will take steps to ensure it doesn't), they have every right to be pissed. 

They were upset that you did this to their niece, and you reacted the worst way possible. If you want to make amends with them, you go to them and apologize. You explain that you never intended on hurting someone they care about, and you reacted so poorly because at the time you didn't see the huge amount of damage. You knew it was wrong, but you didn't fully understand that affect it would have on your wife.

What does this have to to with Sunggyu? Well hearing his solo debut made me sit up and listen. This is the first time I started taking Infinite seriously and it made me go back and give Infinite a second chance. His whole solo album is really gorgeous.

[**Wonder Boyz - Open the Door**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfGGEFoNJek) - So when I saw that [Im Chang Jung song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O9YceKnDo4) get popular a little while ago I was kind of surprised to first listen to it because the Wonder Boyz had debuted with almost that exact same song over a year ago. I know that the producer or something sold them both slightly modified versions of the same song so it's not technically plagiarism but I feel like you shouldn't be able to do that because it kinda takes the identity of the song away from the first group you sold it to. Rant aside, this song and video are both hilarious and really well done.

7. [**B.A.P - Warrior**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tLooPlf2Sw) - B.A.P's debut was so memorable and had such a song impact. I feel like it kind of pioneered this kind of grungy, dirty, rough and tumble kind of kpop. If had been done before B.A.P then it at least didn't get big until B.A.P. Groups that debut with this new kind of kpop are still being compared to B.A.P, and in my opinion, that's with good reason.

8. [**BTS - No More Dream**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw540DtB5mM) - Like B.A.P, BTS really had impact in their debut and with their dance skills, rap skills, and vocal skills they brought a lot to the table from the very beginning. Hip hop aesthetics usually aren't my thing but I look past that for certain groups, BTS is one of them.

9. [**Cross Gene - La Di Da Di**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTCXEQ3zmUY) - As a linguist I am really fond of 2nd language approximation and this song is brimming with examples of that. That is, these members represent a whole scale of English pronunciation in non-native speakers from it's very best to it's very worst. Aa a bonus, this song and dance are also really fun.

10. [**VIXX - Super Hero**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pT0rl2luupY) - I actually didn't like this song the first few times I listened to it but it grew on me in the best possible way. It's so catchy and easy to sing along to that I'm even able to look past the [horrible clothing](http://kpoppedcherry.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/412.jpg?w=474) featured in the video."

Embracing_the_Pain,AskMen,1388960377.0,"Yeah. Happened once in a conversation nine months ago with a rather morbidly obese female friend of mine. For a little context, she was an old friend of mine from High School, who at one time dated a ex-best friend of mine from that same time. I knew she had a small crush on me, but I've never been into morbidly obese women, and with her that was just a small part. Even though she was obese, I don't date a bro's ex, no matter how far removed they are from my life, and our personalities were so wildly different, not bad, just different, that there was no way she and I would ever be together.

So one night nine months ago she was laid up in the hospital for something, and we got to chatting on facebook. We were talking about this other guy that she had been seeing for a while. Just trying to be a good friend and give her a guys perspective on dating. After a while she flips the table on me and starts asking about my dating life. I wasn't seeing anyone at the time, wasn't really interested in anyone, but she still starts pestering me about what kind of women I like, specifically what physical features I like in a woman. 

Now, I've never been one to have an exact type. I don't have a laundry list of features that a woman has to fit in to in order for me to be attracted to her, and I told her that it's a great personality that will get me to stick around. Is she a good person, fun to be around, or low maintenance are thing that I look for more than looks. I have a couple of red flags, morbid obesity being one of them, but I've never really had a specific physical type.

So I started thinking back on all the women I've dated or found myself attracted to, and came up with a somewhat generic list of tall, slim, blond or brunette. It didn't describe every woman, but that were some of the more common traits.

Well, it didn't take long before I was blasted for being shallow, with her expressing concerns for me ending up alone if I don't expand my horizons for what I look for in women. Even though I tried to fight this, expressing that I was into a woman's personality more, I still was being shallow.

I don't exactly control what I do and don't find attractive, but I was shamed for it out in real life."

You are really in no position to diagnose OP with a sex obsession based on this one post. Obviously everyone knows that there's more to having a significant other than just having sex. That said, sex is not an insignificant part of being in a relationship. Did OP balance that with other things? Maybe not.

Edit: c
Comment reply to someone who got voted under the threshold. 
Adding here, because it expands my initial visceral WTF reaction to a more coherent rant.  Also, clarity.

~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~*~ ~~

If someone had the bull under control (snap to a halter or that ring in his nose) and someone else was holding the kid, I'd be fine with it. Both factors for chaos and pain are being restrained by (presumably) responsible people.
But that wouldn't be ""cool"" now, would it?

There's acceptable risk, and then there's camwhoring your kid's life and health.
Personally, I don't think kids should be working around livestock until they're at least 7. Your kids, your situation, and your experiences will vary.

Mutton Busting events seem to be real popular in the Western states, and I think 5 is too damned young. Means that they're practicing at 4.

Everyone has a different line for this, but I think most reasonable people could agree that what is happening here is over the line.

That's a bull. That bull also has a ring in his nose. As someone who has worked around livestock, even the most docile bull is potentially dangerous. 

I had an Angus bull gently inform me that the gate failed, by licking the small of my back while I was cleaning a wound on his flank... I was goddamned lucky; received a wet raspy lesson in making sure that the gate lock actually worked.  Much better than a bleedy, smashy, screamy lesson. 

The other half of that is kids that age are suddenly mobile, very fast, and not steady on their feet.
So, when I went to with ""what's the worst that can happen?"" I got a preventable tragedy resulting in a death or severe life-altering damage.

Kid runs over to bull, grabs a leg or tail, and gets stepped on. Trampled, if he startles the bull.
That's a 20 lb kid next to a fully intact 1600lb male animal. Accidents happen.

Faithhandler,gainit,1388960440.0,"Okay, so, in regards to genetics, that shit is so complicated and confused that it can be hard to pin down any detailed specifics about the impact that shit has. Especially as epigenetics are a thing, and particular genes can be expressed/triggered differently based upon life habits and other conditions. More often than not, when you hear someone say that it's genetics that prevents them from X or hinders them in Z, it's just a kinda lame excuse. Yes, we can't *all* be Schwarzeneggers or Bolts's or Phelps's, but we are all fairly damn capable of bulking, cutting, running, swimming or what the fuck ever. The biggest impact in any of these things is dedication, time commitment, knowledge, and nutrition. We are not slaves to our bodies. It really just comes down to knowlege, nutrition, and training. 

For many, 160 pounds is lithe as fuck. Given my frame, it'd make me a pretty thick dude carrying that much weight. I plan on doing it, and, am fully capable of doing it. That 160, for others, is maybe more comparable to a good 180 or a good 200 in terms of mass to frame ratio etc, but no matter the end point relative to what and who we are, it's totally doable. 

Skinny fat people are simply those who don't workout and eat poorly but not enough to gain weight, as all gaining weight requires is a caloric surplus; regardless of what it is. A skinny fat person is just a person who eats like shit, who doesn't train, but still probably eats at or below caloric maintenance. That's it. You know those people who live on diet pepsi and french fries? Those are usually those people.  "

miked4o7,pics,1388960742.0,"&gt;Sure, but judge the behavior, not the beliefs.
If someone is motivated to give ten percent of their income to homelessness because of their belief in God, then what does their belief have to do with you?

It only has to do with me in that they're making real decisions that effect the real world on bad premises.  You're right, sometimes it's not harmful and lots of times it's even good... but it sets a bad precedent because that same motivation of faith can lead to very bad things as well.  Whereas reason and compassion alone could lead you to give to charity... but reason and compassion alone would not lead you to crying every night and straining your relationship with your child because you're convinced their homosexuality has doomed them to eternal punishment.


&gt;Trying to correct the thoughts of others regardless of their actions is such an awful vice of evangelicals I'm quite surprised to hear it coming from someone who claims to be an atheist.

You're giving it a very negative-sounding wording... but this is what all persuasion is.  Whether I'm trying to convince a reviewer about the conclusion of a study, if I'm trying to convince my friend to pick a certain movie over another one, if I'm trying to convince somebody not to drink and drive, if I'm trying to convince somebody to be nice to somebody else, whether I'm trying to convince somebody to vote for campaign finance reform, etc etc.

Sparkade,destinyknot,1388960790.0,Alright going on now
Jourdin,AskWomen,1388960790.0,"Oh man, I can totally sympathize. This happened to me when my boyfriend and I first got together (it was a long time coming and I was *really* excited that it finally happened, in short), and I let myself do it because I liked the feeling of euphoria that came with the infatuation. But I realized it wasn't healthy. I think the reason I did it is because I am a chronic over-thinker and have some very slight obsessive-compulsive tendencies (note: if you have these kinds of thought patterns with other things, it may be worth seeing a therapist about).

I stopped the habit through a combination of it just wearing off on its own, and deliberately making myself focus on what I was doing at the time. I would let myself have good thoughts (like ""oh gee I love him so much! Whew! I am so happy!"") but then I'd continue with whatever I was doing. You really just have to keep yourself distracted.

As far as having a healthy sense of detachment in relationships, make sure you keep doing things that you enjoy, like whatever hobbies or pastimes you like. Keep certain parts of your life separate from your partner and allow them to do the same. For example, when we go out to socialize with our friend group we sit near each other but talk to our friends separately. He likes to have alone time and tells me when he needs it, and I go visit my family in the next state over on school breaks without much fuss about leaving him.

I like to take care of my boyfriend, because I'm a caring person; I like to nurture. But I do struggle sometimes with finding the right balance between being caring/nurturing and being almost harmfully selfless. I make sure I am doing things for myself and because I want to, and try not to sacrifice my own needs for his unless he's sick or has specifically asked me for help with something.

I hope that helps!

Edit: Ooh, also, writing in a journal has really helped me! When I feel all sappy and want to tell my boyfriend something but feel like it would be kind of awkward or startling to text him out of the blue about, I write it in my journal instead!"

mkvgtired,cars,1388960839.0,"[Here are some](http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/gallery/Worlds-Top-5-arms-exporters/3105/) of the large ones. The US doesn't look like it is one of the top importers for at least these. Although German, Austrain, and Swiss guns are popular in the US. I think those sales are probably dwarfed by sales of aircraft and other arms, but that is just a guess. 

&gt;Thus if the US is spying and installing backdoors, it really is an issue world-wide.

I agree, but many multinationals have redundant servers in Northern Sweden as well. It is almost impossible to isolate yourself from networks in Europe either. 

I agree, the anger at the NSA is *definitely* warranted. I just wish we'd see more outrage elsewhere. These activities are likely against European privacy laws as well. If everyone is only angry at the NSA I am worried that the NSA will change its behavior but all these other spying agencies will fly under the radar making minimal changes or none at all. 

The UK's GCHQ stores every bit of data that passes through their country for three days. They're working on expanding that capability. A Senate committee said NSA spying ""needs to change"", there has been talk of defunding it, and a Federal Judge stated their actions are ""likely unconstitutional"". I try to keep up with international news, but have heard much less anger about this program than the NSA. 

Given the fact most multinationals have redundant servers in Europe, all of us, regardless of country, need to be pissed about these programs. If you access Facebook in Europe, your data likely goes through Sweden. Giving Sweden legal access to it, and since all first world nations seem to share information, all of that transaction can be scrutinized by pretty much any intelligence agency. Only changing the NSA activities wont solve this issue. "

ifisa,TumblrInAction,1388960921.0,"I kind of agree with this post.  There's a heavy handed connection in the media that paints people with mental illnesses as a hair's breadth from killing people at any point.  I'm going to quote myself from the post about the sign language interpreter guy, just to put this info out there again:

I would like to point out these ""potentially dangerous mental illness"" comments are actually kind of ""ableist.""  Schizophrenics are mostly non-violent.  Generally it is the paranoid schizophrenics that have the higher rate of violence, and they can function normally through treatment options.

I just wanted to point out that violence isn't as wide spread as most people believe.  [This](http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/180/6/490.full#sec-17) study confirms a statistical association between Schizophrenia and violence but points out that 99.97% will not be arrested for violence in any given year and the rate of homicide in schizophrenic men is 1:3000 while the rate in general male population is 15.1:100,000 (0.43:3000).  So while they are *relatively* much more likely to commit murder than the general population, the rate is still very small among sufferers of Schizophrenia.

I did some research on this when someone stated we shouldn't allow people with mental illnesses to own guns because they will kill people and I realized I didn't know anything about the actual statistics on the matter."

almightybob1,AskReddit,1388961107.0,"&gt; First of all, the Trinity is a very Catholic concept

No it isn't. It's mainstream Christian doctrine. The number of non-trinitarian Christians is dwarfed by the number of trinitarian Christians. Most major Christian denominations are trinitarian, including the Catholic church, the Anglican communion and the vast majority of Protestant denominations. Most Christians are Nicene Christians.

You appear to be pretty underinformed. I suggest you read about the Council of Nicaea and the Nicene Creed.

&gt; Jesus being fully human and fully divine is not a breach of logic

I just demonstrated that it is. I don't think you understand the rules of logic. I will repeat it again below.

&gt; what is divinity? What is fully human?

It doesn't matter. For the purposes of logic, all we need to know is that they are two different things. 

Again: By the rules of logic, if A = B and B =/= C, then A =/= C.

Therefore if Jesus = human and human =/= divine, then Jesus =/= divine.

Formally: 

    H ≠ D
    J = H
    ∴ J ≠ D

If Jesus = divine and human =/= divine, then Jesus =/= human.

    H ≠ D
    J = D
    ∴ J ≠ H

Unless human = divine, there is no situation in which Jesus = divine = human. 

And if human = divine, then why make any distinction? That means every one of us is human and divine, since they are the same thing. It means Jesus wasn't special."

unfortunately, i don't sight-read that quickly so if i write anything in these keys, it doesn't make it very easy to play it back.

But in almost all cases, it lingers, and you have to manage it. I'm able to run a lot of volume on mine as long as I take good care of it, which includes:

* Regular PT
* Rolling it out pretty much whenever I'm sitting at a desk (I have one ball at home and one at work)
* Icing several times per day, especially after runs or after standing for a long time
* Always wearing shoes, usually with an arch support in my bad foot
* Doing all of my exercises given to me through PT (these are individual so I recommend seeing a PT first) as often as I'm supposed to
* Regular massage
* Sleeping with a night splint for as many nights as I can without going crazy

Six months out is a long time. Even if you have a relatively severe case I think you'll be OK. It might still hurt a bit for the marathon but it should be manageable by then. I'd start by going to a PT who sees a lot of runners. They can help you evaluate how much time you need off, if any."

She made a list of reasons why she hated me and posted it online. I found out by accident when I was checking her computer to see if the internet problems I was having was just my computer or if both of us were down. This list consisted of everything from ""she has a big nose"" to ""she laughs during tv shows"". The best part was the ending, where she said I needed to go to a party, get drunk and raped to get some sense knocked into me.

She did a ton of things like bunked our beds randomly, rearranged our room when I wasn't there. She would write nasty messages about me on our dry erase board and gossip constantly about me. I was harshly judged for not drinking my freshman year, and I was very, very, naive about sex so those two things were constantly being thrown at me like I was an awful person.

Naturally she's friends with a lot of my friends and they can't believe this story when I tell them. One of my good friends is her good friend too. We just don't talk about her, but I imagine that she's trash talked me. My friend just said ""Oh, yeah, G said that you two didn't get along"".

Y'see, I wasn't Catholic, and was sent there for reasons that are bizarre but for which I am ultimately thankful. Anyway, from third grade forward I basically got the rough sketches of the Bible. Ninth grade was in-depth study of several books (the Pentateuch, the New Testament Gospels, Paul's letters).

In tenth grade, though, we got to learn the history of the Bible. We spent the better part of an entire semester on it. The ideas of multiple authors explaining the Genesis 1 and 2. The probability that the Gospel of John was written by a Christian scholarly community 80 or so years after Christ's death. The process by which it was refined down, Gnostic texts excluded, and the Vulgate arrived at. The status of the Apocrypha. 

Then it shifted into a theological history of the Catholic Church, which was endlessly fascinating to me. The Schism, the 14th-15th Century's divided papacy, the endless Councils, the Reformation... so great to see, as it were, the sausage being made.

That is still my favorite history class."

I love my job because it's different every day and I get to do a lot of unique and interesting things, like the time I spent an entire day figuring out how to make a fake glass lampshade that could break on top of an actor's head and look and sound realistic without hurting him or making any dangerous shards. On the other hand, it's a pain in the ass because I work crazy long hours, and directors often have no idea of what is or isn't a reasonable request.

Tiki_Lamp,audioengineering,1388961324.0,"I think the subtractive approach is a bigger tip for people whose natural tendency is to boost something to get that sound instead of cutting whatever's interfering with it. Not so much as a definite replacement, but as a viable option. For instance, if you have all your levels sitting right, but there's two tracks fighting for a certain frequency range, instead of boosting one over the other, you can cut the other without pushing your levels too high (which in my opinion is worse than too low).

A subtractive approach doesn't mean you don't boost at all, at least not in my interpretation of it."

Actually it would make them look crazy and deligitmize their views unless they also made an attempt to become more moderate. This is exactly the reason the right is starting to abandon the Tea-nuts. They realize that as long as the left has moderates on their side it makes the extremists on the right seem even crazier and they lose rational people who may agree with them more than the left but go to the left because they seem to be the only ones who speak rationally. 

The goal is to appeal to the middle. Trying to appeal to the base only alienates the middle and pushes them to the other side. You will likely never convert the other base to your side. Focus on winning over the middle which can only be done with reasonably rational discussion. "

Heck, a lot of the b&amp;m stores get most (if not all) of their hardware from fasttech themselves.  As a consumer I (and a couple millions others) are the community.  A friend of the community in business sells product that is in demand at a price that the consumers are willing to pay.

I'll happily pay a 50% markup for fasttech hardware to get from an American vendor now rather than waiting a month...  But my guess is that this guy has a huge markup, too much old stock to move, and generally got into business to make a buck.  And fasttech was probably selling vape gear before he knew the difference between a cargo and a clearo.  Though I guess we'll never know, he won't share his business because he knows doing so will hurt his business.

Having said all of that, you've put yourself in a position of informing the public about their options...  My personal opinion is that if you intend to remain respectable is that it was your responsibility to include information on fasttech.

I can safely say that the hottest guy in the world could have walked in naked &amp; I wouldn't have felt a thing. 

Proper low libido is the entire loss of sexual desire. I've said this before, but sexual desire feels like an alien concept. An alien language. 

I like to equate it to appetite. Low libido is like being totally stuffed with food, utterly content with the current situation. The someone presents you with a piece of your favourite cake - peanut butter cheesecake. But you can't eat it, you're full! So you get all the: 'What's the matter, you used to love cheesecake', 'Is it the way I cooked it?' 'I knew it, you don't like cheesecake anymore!' 'Is it because you snacked a lot earlier?' 'Do you like another type of cake now?'

By the way, my libido is pretty much recovered now, but it's horrible feeling broken like that. It took a long time to get my confidence back."

* Be willing to ask for help when you need it. Look something up on the internet first, but if the solutions provided are vague or too complicated as for help.

* Say what you want. This goes back to my first point, but I must reiterate it because my sister's relationship ended recently (I'm guessing) mostly because she wouldn't say what she wanted and then got mad because her BF did what he wanted instead.

* Asking for clarification before getting mad. I have gotten in trouble because I may not be the most graceful talker (working on it) so what I say can be open for misinterpretation. Unless what what they say is unambiguously offensive ask for clarification before getting mad."

MaximilianKohler,AskReddit,1388961874.0,"&gt; Any sexual contact without informed and enthusiastic consent is rape.

Only when it involves humans, as humans can communicate consent or non consent to each other.

How is a dog voluntarily mounting a person and fucking them with great vigor not equal to ""enthusiastic consent""?

&gt;However, they don't have a way to communicate their consent to us

They communicate their consent to us the same way they do with each other; through body language.

If you're a male trying to rape a dog who doesn't want it, that dog is going to struggle and try to bite.

If you're trying to fuck a donkey that doesn't want it it's simply going to run away...

Not to mention all the other things we do with and to animals that they haven't consented to...

Keeping a pet at home or in zoos is kidnapping &amp; imprisonment. Breeding animals in cages then slaughtering and eating them is torture &amp; murder.

Riding horses, making animals slave away plowing fields and such, making animals compete in sports for our amusement, etc. etc... They haven't consented to any of that.

But we're just going to ignore all these things and draw the line at sexual pleasure? I have no idea where this consent argument popped up, but it's ridiculous."

I mean, when I was 13, my dad gave me a 12"" arkansas toothpick as a present.  That night, he got drunk.  I was sitting on the couch playing with the knife.  He starts getting angry and starts giving me this lecture about how I'm not a real man (no shit dad, I'm 13) because I haven't ever been in the military and then he starts talking about killing people and that's when shit tends to get really scary in the Overlord household, because that's when the real deep self-hatred boils up.

And he tells me to give him the knife, so I do because you don't say no when he's like this.  And he pulls it out and is holding it up, and I'm like..okay, now is when we leave because dad has never been like this *with a knife in his hand* and we already know about the fists and the belt.  So I put my hand on the coffee table and despite being drunk and years out of practice he throws the knife *perfectly* and sinks it an inch into the table right inbetween my thumb and forefinger.

And it's very very important to not scream and not start crying, even though you've never been this scared.  Calmly pull the knife out of the table, slide the TV Guide over the hole, sheath the knife, walk slowly to the bedroom, and hope nothing triggers him.

The next day his buddy comes over.  I'm sitting on the couch.  I grab the TV Guide, because when you live in this house, you forget the traumas by morning or you go crazy.  And then dad sees the hole and he's pissed.  ""You had that knife one day and you put a hole in the table!""

""No dad, you did that.  Last night, when you threw the knife at me. Did you remember that?""

Dad's friend eyes are wide. Dad is quiet, ashamed.  Because he doesn't remember.  He never does.

...

So no, I'm not dangerous.  But I'm also not scared of you.  I'm not scared of getting hurt.  And if you try to make me afraid of you, and you're not as scary as him?

Man, you're just going to piss me off for trying.  'Cause I made a promise to myself that nobody was going to push me around and scare me anymore a long, long time ago.

This is mostly what I do:

I have Last.fm and Pitchfork apps on my Spotify. I use the ""recommended artists"" on spotify, I look at Pitchfork's ""best new albums"" and spotify I use recommendations for albums from bands I like that I haven't listened to and related artists. Spotify makes it easy because you can sample bands fast, see what are songs are most popular and utilize other apps tapping into it.

Seriously, though. The responses you've encountered are pretty common; nobody really understands asexuality right off the bat, including the great majority of asexuals. It's just completely off the general cultural map to not have a sex drive (this is how we end up with movies like ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and such tripe, like that's a shocking or terrible thing). In my experience the two best ways to explain asexuality are to compare it to atheism (""You're an asexual with respect to males, I'm just asexual with regard to one more sex than that"") or to use AVEN's analogy to a radio--everyone has a radio, but some people can only clearly pick up the country station on the hill, and some people pick up the alternative station from downtown, and others pick up all the stations around here...and some people don't get good reception for any station (and at the same time, people have different volume, or libido, settings--for some it's a quiet murmur and for others it's a tremendous and pervasive roar, and it's completely independent from which station they're tuned to). Best of luck with that, it's harder for you since you're the one that's in it, but it's not easier for others to really understand at first blush.

Also, if you find kissing disgusting, try thinking about what happens with a handshake sometime. Or, maybe don't. It'll certainly make you want to adopt the fist-bump as your default greeting of choice.

Anyway, welcome to the crowd! If you're into labels, I'd guess from your story that you're aromantic and asexual. (Or as some of us prefer to say, ""we have more important things to do with our time."") Glad you found a place to be, and we're happy to share and/or answer any questions you might have. "
mrpoopistan,PurplePillDebate,1388962521.0,"TRP would not advocate domestic violence for the simple reason that if you're invested in a relationship enough to commit an act of violence, then you're doing it wrong.

TRP -- in its idealized form, anyhow -- hangs a lot on the notion of being detached from the type of investment in a relationship that domestic violence would require.

Also worth pointing out is that a decent number of the guys there are talkin shit. If you think there aren't 19 y.o. wimps on there vocalizing fantasies they have about using physicality to get back at women in general, then you're delusional. There are.

It's a problem, but it's also part of what the idealized version of TRP is trying to fix. You shouldn't be that invested in any girl. It's insane and it's dumb and it's weak."

As far as the screen looking squished, that is most likely an issue with your TV's aspect ratio. Look on the remote and find the button that changes it. If you have a 60"" Samsung TV that will allow you to adjust it. Because it'll be in 480i form the red/white/yellow cables, you will have black bars on the right and left of the screen.

plazmid,TwoXChromosomes,1388962714.0,"Then consider the emotional health of the family if they go bankrupt paying for this woman's hospital bill--especially if the fetus dies in the end. Then they're spent (potentially) months grieving the daughter (who is definitely not coming back), months, riding the emotional rollercoaster of not knowing whether the fetus is okay or not, and then grieving the loss of a baby. 

And on top of that if they go bankrupt dealing with the hospital bills, they could be in danger of losing the house or the car or being able to pay for food, all of which puts the surviving child at risk.

Chantelle, that you were trying goes A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H...  You can see that FF and H are the eighth letter in each system respectively, so the bras you were trying were a 38FF and a 40FF in UK sizing.  A 36GG will have the same cup volume as a 40FF and one cup volume more than a 38FF, and a tighter band than either of them.

See, I think this can be true for parent-child relationships in which there's no psychological disorder. Maybe they just had a disagreement, or don't see eye-to-eye as far as politics, religion, or life values, and will later realize their fault and become close again.

But when it comes to people with personality disorders, the best thing you can do for yourself is get as far away from them as f*cking possible and never look back. Surround yourself with mentally stable people who truly care for you.

lurkernomore99,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1388962969.0,"Here is my dating advice to anyone:

Sometimes we get wrapped up in ""i want a boyfriend"" or ""i want to have a baby by xx age"" or ""everyone my age is married"" and forget that the whole point of dating is to find a person who compliments you well. It isn't about making that person like you, or beating a biological clock or even getting married by a certain age. 

Going on many many many dates will introduce you to many many many people. The more people you meet, the more you will be able to determine what you're looking for and what best compliments you. Just because you have horrible dates doesn't mean anything other than this person wasn't compatible with you. Use bad dates as stories for the good ones. 

Be true to yourself, be honest with your feelings and enjoy being young and meeting new people. When it happens, it happens. Until then, try a new drink and a new appetizer with the new date because what do you have to lose? "

Also, he wasn't a visitor to my profile when he was logged on (per list of visitors). In the past he's always shown up on the list so I don't think he disabled visitor mode. Furthermore I'm the type of person who likes to prepare for the worst but hope for the best. If the evidence could point equally to two different outcomes, one of which would make me happy and one of which would not, I prefer to operate on the likelihood that the one that would not make me happy is correct. This protects against getting my hopes up, and then if I'm wrong I can be happily surprised. Finally, Occam's razor suggests that the least complicated scenario is the most likely. It makes more sense that he's still looking around, especially considering that we're not exclusive, than that he disabled his visitors specifically to look at my profile. Not *impossible*, just not as likely.

DropShop06,AskMen,1388963004.0,"Jeez, took that a bit far didn't you bud? 

Look, what /u/Demoscraft is saying isn't far off the mark. As a 6'3"" skinny brown haired guy, confidence is freaking huge for me. Being comfortable in your own skin is amazing, and people (not just women) pick it up and react in a more positive fashion. 

I accepted a long time ago that I was going to be skinny for the rest of my life, unless I took action to get big. Thing is, I didn't *want* to get big as I liked me the way I was. This lead to me trying out more things involving people where I would be putting myself in situations that had the potential to be embarrasing or even awkward. However, those situations never became either of those because I stayed confident in myself and my abilities. People (again, not just women) noticed that, and soon I became an attractive person (in the sense of people wanted to hang out/liked being around me more). 

Confidence goes a long way, especially when you're fat or skinny. People sense it, and they like it.

NOTE: I would also like to note that confidence should not be confused with being loud or rude. Being either/both of those just makes loud and/or rude.

NOTE: Working out is sort of a catalyst for confidence as well, though not everyone needs it. I work out, but you would not be able to tell unless someone told you."

However, she is not trying to help herself. At all. She is not taking medication, drinking water, or telling her doctor the truth. This woman knows her conditions are affecting her husband (and her son, who I bet wants to have fun with his mother and go on trips with her) and is doing *nothing.* She's drinking beer, dehydrating herself, and eating junk, all things that make IC worse. There are medications and treatments; she has actually rendered her interstim ineffective by continuing to do things that cause her pain. Until she starts looking after herself and doing *something* to address the issue, such as following the IC diet that OP says she has refused to consider, we can't feel too sorry for her. It's important to bear in mind that it's possible for someone with IC to have a good sex life with time and care, and she's throwing that chance away.

No drama, everyone (that I've met around here) is nice and I know almost everyone. A lot of kid related activities during the summer while the pool is open. You can rent the grounds and club house for private events. 

No racism. Sexual predators are NOT allowed to live here!

Annual events held at the ""tree house"" aka club house such as 4th of July parade and pool party, end of school pool party, Oktoberfest, wine and beer tastings, etc. etc. etc. Lots of kids, teenagers, adults, seniors, everyone. 

The kids go to either Christie elem. or Hughston (Hughston is better IMO) carpenter is the middle school and Clark is the high school. 

Section 8 is accepted throughout the neighborhood in the rentals I think you should know. The only ""shady"" part of the neighborhood is the top left of treehouse in the duplexes. Even then though, it's quiet and not bad. Tenants don't usually stay for that long. 

I've known people that lived here for nearly their entire lives and it's a really great community. I'm sure there are other places in plano like this, but I'm telling ya simply what I know. Message me with questions.

i have no tools to succeed at my job, and the executive assistant who is now working with me is stretched so thin it's absolutely cruel.  they appear to have no immediate plans to hire anyone new.  the biggest part is that a few of the architects have now seen an opportunity to take advantage of the situation by asking me to make judgment calls I don't really have the authority to make.

I would choose to find a new job at this point, except that my fiance is getting relocated in 6-8 months and we will be moving at least 1000 miles away most likely in July.

asstasticbum,nfl,1388963567.0,"So I live in the Minneapolis area and I'm going fucking stir, like [cabin fever crazy](http://i.imgur.com/xSqYuJI.jpg), so after the Chargers game I bundled up, lit up a nice cigar and went on a 3 mile walk. The temp is -11F with the windchill its -36F. 

At a windchills of 35 degrees below zero, flesh will freeze within 10 minutes. At 50 below, it takes only five minutes.

I'm an old fart, 38, I played high school football from '91 - '94 and the got a D1 college ride (now called FCS) and played 2.5 years from '96 - '99 before getting both knees blown out. I remember playing ball in this shit (before 'global warming') and after my walk &amp; stogie, now watching this game, and how my body feels, man...no matter the how much bundling you do on the field its a fucking hell frozen over on that field right now. And to get just fucking hammered into that field is like playing a full contact game in the parking lot. My knees ache from just casual walking in this shit, but had to do it.

I always thought my redheaded stepchildren MN Vikings were pussies for not playing outside, and still do (can't wait for next two years). However each year I gain more and more respect for the Green Bay Packers as each year they deal with this weather. Can't say I'm rooting for them though, but gotta respect them. ^^^^ducks ^^^^and ^^^^hides ^^^GO ^^^9ers!"

anatomizethat,knitting,1388963743.0,"I've taught a couple of people to knit and found this is true. It is much easier (as in, less frustrating) to cast on and do a foundation row for them, and then they get the rhythm of doing knit or purl stitches.

I also advise only teaching one at a time...have them knit until they're really really comfortable with it, then teach them to purl.

When you DO teach casting on, make them do it over, and over, and over and over. Literally...have them cast on a hundred stitches. Then knock it back down to 10, have them knit a few rows, and then have them start from scratch again. It's a bit frustrating to be told, ""Okay, now start over,"" but when they look at you and say, ""Uhh, what do I do to start?"" They'll appreciate that you're sitting there giving them instructions :)

Also...provide them with YouTube links of what you've taught them! I found that some people want their hand held through the initial steps, so they have someone to show them where/how they make mistakes, but they can easily follow a YouTube tutorial from there on."

(for now) Add to that the fact that having a Google+ is better for your SEO, the integration of hangouts (another service forcibly integrated)...

Google+ is forced upon users that want to use certain features. Will that work in the long run? Hard to say. But I bet a ton of those active users aren't actually active users of Google+ at all.

killthealias,Games,1388963888.0,"2013 was a big year of change for me. Around December of 2012 I finally caved and build my own gaming PC. The introduction of a PC as the centrepiece of my gaming life opened up so many games that I either would not have played on console or enjoyed on console nearly as much. I invested DAYS into playing Counter Strike, Kerbal Space Program and the FAR superior version of Skyrim (compared to the PS3 version, which I had previously). Through my gaming PC, I was introduced to sales, BIG sales, enabling me to spend almost the same amount as I had thus far invested in my PS3 library and come out with almost 10x the amount of games. Not only that, but the quality of graphics I found on my PC was incredible, it really changed the way I looked at games. Thanks to switching, I got to experience wonderful, artistic games like The Stanley Parable. THIS is what really changed my outlook on games in 2013, I can't wait to see what 2014 holds in store. "

Mainly that students at women's colleges aren't as isolated as you might think.  My school is part of a consortium, as are many other single-gender schools, meaning that students from the co-ed schools that we are associated with can take classes at my school, and we can take classes at theirs.  Additionally, remember that single-gender schools still have both male and female faculty, so while there is a bit of an echo chamber it's not as complete as you might think.  Lastly, this is a controversial issue, but my school and other women's colleges do have a number of trans* and genderqueer students on campus, so even within our own student body there is diversity."
silverionmox,PoliticalDiscussion,1388963910.0,"&gt;No, you're in favor of women getting the shitty parts of sex

They accept the risk with the sex, just like the men accept the risk with the sex. Then when it has unwanted consequences, women get an emergency exit - men should get one too. They still won't be able to keep the child if their partner decides they don't want it. That's where the asymmetrical burden of pregnancy is reflected.

&gt;while you get the ""I can just walk away, if I'm still a fucking man child.""

That's exactly the same argument moral conservatives use against abortion. Yes, I'm repeating myself, but that's because you keep repeating your appeal to sexist notions that men are sex-crazed thugs who need to forced at gunpoint to take care of children."

myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1388963964.0,"&gt;TRP points out that not only are ""being a decent and kind person"" and ""treating women as, I don't know, actual people"" not just insufficient behaviors for attracting desirable women, they're not even necessary - look at all the assholes, jerks, scumbags, and even criminals who attract and keep quality women. While it's possible to be decent and kind and attract women, TRP attempts to discern the reasons why it's not necessary while others try to summarily dismiss the women who date assholes as outliers or summarily dismiss the possibility that the asshole behaviors themselves are at all attractive in their own right.

There are many, many reasons to encourage people to be kind and not an asshole, and relationships are a big part of it. Actively encouraging asshole behavior can do nothing but harm, so most people will avoid that because they have empathy.

&gt;TRP points out that there are certain discrepancies between women's words and actions that frequently and reliably appear, even if it's not every single woman who displays these discrepancies. What women say should not always be taken at face value*. Elsewhere, trying to point this out gets you branded a misogynistic scumbag.

Can you give some examples of discrepancies between women's words and actions? Would you consider the stereotype against men that they won't ask for help even if they need it an example of such a discrepancy? Or, perhaps, a man promising commitment when he doesn't have any such intention?

&gt;TRP points out that, as a general rule (established by collective experience, observation, and popular media produced by both women and men and valued in particular by women), women genuinely prefer their men to be the dominant initiative-takers in their relationships, and that women's attraction tends to fade as the situation is reversed. Elsewhere, the only acceptable position is one where neither partner is the lead decision-maker, and a man preferring to be in the lead decision-making role (even where the woman approves of her complementary role) is a misogynist scumbag.

This is absolutely untrue. No one has a problem with one or the other partner being the lead initiative taker in any individual relationship. The problem comes when TRPers say things like it's the ""natural state of things"" or ""the way it should be"". Then it's oppressive and sexist. To make the somewhat played out racism analogy, it's the difference between saying a black man should be a garbage man if he wants to and black men should be garbage men.

&gt;TRP points out that there are substantial risks involved in committing to a woman with a high partner count, enough to discourage the practice in general. For example, a woman who has had lots of casual sex in the past but is now trying to ""put it all behind her"" as she gets older and get you to commit is in all likelihood viewing you as a ""stable provider guy"" second choice who won't get to see the side of her she presented to the ""fun sexually adventurous guys"" she was with before you. Often, a high partner count is the only warning a man will get. Elsewhere, questioning a woman's sexual past or insisting that it matters to you gets you branded as, again, a misogynistic scumbag.

Again untrue. Having preferences is one thing, and perfectly fine. Prescribing behavior and generalizing is another. I love slutty women, and will probably settle down with one, and I don't think I'm wrong. They're just my people. As far as I can tell, the idea that formerly slutty women become worse in the sack once they decide to become monogamous is based on nothing.

&gt;
While the best non-TRP pieces of advice rightly points out that you should get fit, improve your appearance, take initiative, and be interesting, they rarely go into detail about the actual business of approaching, flirting, establishing a physical connection, and initiating sexual activity. When they do, they often give advice that is too slow/conservative and/or inapplicable to purely casual sex and dance around the fact that what women say shouldn't always be taken at face value (though there is reasonable non-TRP advice to be found on these aspects - it's just rare).

Far as I can tell, TRP and PUA offers *terrible* advice on the specifics. It just give guys the confidence to actually try. Whenever someone goes to TRP and says ""What happened? I came on way too strong!"" or ""I creeped her out!"" or ""I came off as an asshole!"" TRP responds ""lol you're supposed to take TRP in moderation bro! Besides, practice makes perfect!"" Practice makes perfect. That is truly the only reliable hook up advice that matters, you can't crack the code of human interaction by reading a guideline.

In short, people think TRP are misogynist scumbags because they say stuff like women have no honor or compassion, not because they like traditional relationship gender dynamics, prefer women with low partner counts, or even because they offer poor hook up advice."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1388964095.0,"Yeah, that's kind of weird. You don't have any proof that anything happened, but I'm leaning more towards the relationship not being 100% platonic. Maybe she was really pushy towards him and wanted them to take pictures? You never know... Definitely tell him your concerns. Unless he's the type of guy who takes pictures constantly with people, it's a little weird. If he reacts well and is understands your feelings then that's good. If he gets defensive or tries to downplay your feelings (especially the former) I'd be concerned. 

Don't just let it go either. If you ask and he's like, ""Of course I'm not cheating on you!"" don't just be like, ""Okay."" Ask him some questions, and reiterate what you think is appropriate to do in a relationship and what's not. Also, explain that if he ever develops a crush on someone, he needs to cut contact with that person instead of developing his feelings. It'll probably be a weird conversation, but stay firm. If he asks what's the big deal about the pictures, tell him that it hurts your feelings that he's willing to take pics with a girl he just met but he won't do that with you. He's continuing to contact this girl on top of that. Plus, you've cheated on before and he's shown a lack of respect for boundaries before.

I'm not saying he's definitely cheating or anything, but I understand your concern."

use_more_lube,funny,1388964175.0,"If someone had the bull under control (snap to a halter or that ring in his nose) and someone else was holding the kid, I'd be fine with it. 
Both factors for chaos and pain are being restrained by (presumably) responsible people. 

But that wouldn't be ""cool"" now, would it? 

There's acceptable risk, and then there's camwhoring your kid's life and health.

Personally, I don't think kids should be working around livestock until they're at least 7. 
Your kids, your situation, and your experiences will vary. 

[Mutton Busting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutton_busting) events seem to be real popular in the Western states, and I think 5 is too damned young. Means that they're practicing at 4.  

Everyone has a different line for this, but I think most reasonable people could agree that what is happening here is over the line. 

That's a bull. That bull also has a ring in his nose. 
As someone who has worked around livestock, even the most docile bull (I had one gently inform me that the gate failed, by licking the small of my back while I was cleaning a wound on his flank) is potentially dangerous.

The other half of that is kids that age are suddenly mobile, very fast, and not steady on their feet. 

So, when I went to with ""what's the worst that can happen?"" I got a preventable tragedy resulting in a death or severe life-altering damage. 

Kid runs over to bull, grabs a leg or tail, and gets stepped on. Trampled, if he startles the bull. 

That's a 20 lb kid next to a fully intact 1600lb male animal.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1388964235.0,"Yes.  Partly because like all clothing, sizes in different models run bigger or smaller, just as you might need a size 8 shoe sometimes and a 9 other times.  Also, because different brands' sizing schematics are different. Many brands - Panache, Cleo, Curvy Kate, Parfait, Bravissimo, Elomi, and Mimi Holliday to name a few - use the UK scheme.  Others make up different schemes.  You'll often see variations of A,B,C,D,DD,DDD,DDDD... or A,B,C,D,DD,F,G,H... labelled ""US sizing"" but really, almost every US maker does their own thing.  

What you want to remember is that you are (probably, assuming the sizes we recommended end up working) the 10th cup volume up in a 36 band, and the 9th in a 38.  (36GG, 38G)  Assuming of course, the bra runs true to size and is the right shape for you.  Just like shoes, really!

This happens a lot, and yet it's always guys who get called out and shamed for discomforting or even inconveniencing women. ""Creep.""

This woman is a creep.

In the past, as a patient, tolerant nice guy, I've ran into too many fake profiles. They lied about their weight. They used profile pics that were well over 2 years old. They lied about their age. Some even lied about their race and culture. 

They don't expect or want to meet you in person or over digital facetime (like skype). They are just satisfied to keep chatting through mail messages forever, using you as an emotional tampon and for the attention they never get in person.

In a way, I can empathize. Most of them, after being caught, apologize and explain their lonely, miserable state of being. It's a sad place to be.

However, it's the same as lying to get sex. They're manipulating people. Setting them up for disappointment just so they get a temporary high from the attention. An emotional fix, rather than a physical one. It's dishonest and selfish.

Is it any wonder then, so many guys will try to cut through the bullshit and jump straight to physical contact without *""getting to know you a bit better""*? Take it too seriously, and you just end up wasting precious time.

A lot of those same girls complain to me that guys are so superficial and just care about profile pics, camera time, or meeting in person ASAP. *They are only contributing to the problem*."

miked4o7,pics,1388964369.0,"&gt;All kinds of things lead to bad results, even good intentions. That's why we don't presume to dissect and correct people's inner thoughts, just how they translate into action.

Yes, but there are objectively good and objectively bad ways of figuring out what's good and what's bad.  For example, if I were to propose that we spin a wheel every Friday to determine whether we go volunteer at a homeless shelter or whether we go sacrifice a homeless person... I hope you'd tell me that's a terrible way of deciding what's the best thing to do on a Friday.

Similarly, it's not hard at all to see that thinking our main source of guidance in life should be a collection of texts from thousands of years ago in a time where even the most knowledgeable human knew less about the world than any 5th grader today, where the culture was decidedly misogynistic and violent, and slavery was thought to be a great institution... just maybe that's not a good idea.


&gt;Plenty of emotional pain and plenty of prejudice arises with no religious intervention whatsoever

I would never argue otherwise.

&gt;and plenty of love and compassion arises from faith, even towards people that violate every tenant of that faith. Some faiths are based on that love and acceptance.

Yes, but to what extent people are channeling their own moral perceptions vs taking them from their religion is always in question, and I'm not even denying that faith in certain religions could be almost completely benign in practice  (like the Jains).  But that doesn't change that relying on faith is a crapshoot of history and culture rather than an informed way of reaching decisions.


&gt;What I'm suggesting is that you consider limiting your powers of persuasion to people taking actions that infringe on your rights or that cause pain in themselves or others, and persuade them to stop the actions.
Convince your friends not to drink and drive, convince them not to see R.I.P.D. (seriously, that one's important) but to insert yourself into their faith and push your own on them then you aren't any better than any other evangelist.


Do you feel this way about politics?  Is it bad for me and my friends to try and convince each other and have debates about political views?  If not, then why would that apply to politics and not religion?

Personally I didn't get into veganism for the animal rights and I don't particularly care. However I do support that side of veganism, even if it's just a passive support.

I try and re-use my clothes and possessions as much as possible, If I need to buy something I will first try to source it 2nd hand before buying brand new. 

I live very minimally and most of my possessions are utilitarian, I personally have no need for paintings, pictures, ornaments or other art pieces.  

All of my stationary and such are recycled (from remarkable.co.uk) and I have a fair amount of 'eco-freindly' clothes from when I have occasionally bought new.

I avoid buying vegan substitute foods (like fake meat) and prefer less processed items for my main diet. I still indulge in the occasional (vegan) junk food though as I haven't quite kicked my junk eating habit from when I was a non-vegan. 

I can't drive and I never plan to, I walk/cycle use public transport instead.

They really, truly don't understand that women are people and not games. We have preferences, feelings and are attracted to different things. 

These guys get INCREDIBLY upset at the idea that niceness and gifts doesn't equal attraction or possible sex while they themselves consider it a fundamental human right that their standards be protected. Like, watch their reactions to the HAES movement or any woman of size daring to have confidence. They dont understand it and think it means fat women are going to FORCE men to have sex with them and are, all in all, just mad that their body type isn't favored by most men (because everything is about men's dicks, don'tcha know? It hasn't crossed their mind that HAES is about self love and larger people wanting the same simple human respect as everybody else instead of being treated like dogshit. But thats my impression of the movement and I could be wrong. I know it's an intersectional offshoot that as a lot to do with Feminism and is thus villified)   ""You cant force me to be attracted to fat women! Oh god!"" They scream...at the top of their lungs. And then its' right back to ""I'm nice to her! Why wont she fuck me?! I did every combo and code the right waaaay""

RaineyDays,AskWomen,1388964839.0,"Firstly, like everyone else said, read the instructions leaflet which is in the box with them.

You don't need to take it out when you pee. Doesn't really matter if you get pee on the string, though I sometimes try to hold the string to the side to keep it out the way. Taking a dry tampon in and out is going to get painful, because it has no lubrication to help it come out (until its full).

You keep them in for 4 - 8 hours, basically until their full so that they slide out easily. If you go pee and there's blood when you wipe, it's time to change it. If after 8 hours you take it out and it's still mostly white, switch to a lower absorbency.

You can wear them in the shower, though I don't normally. My routine is to get up, pee, remove tampon and go in the shower. But the string getting wet doesn't weaken it, you can wear them swimming and stuff, and usually (in the decent brands anyway) the string is sewn in the length of the tampon so it's pretty secure. If in any case the string does come off, you can (gently) put a couple of fingers up and tug it out. "

Becoming an adult is realising that no one is infallible or superior. Your parents, your boss, your idols; at some point they felt like you. The only difference is that they haven't know what they've been doing for longer.

Calm down. You don't have to go to uni. Don't rush into anything. Enjoy your free time while you can. Try to save some money. There is always time for university in the future - I wish *I'd* waited.

TheLastHayley,PoliticalDiscussion,1388965077.0,"I probably should've mentioned these too, sorry. To sum a few standard issues up:

* There is very limited coverage for transgender-related treatments, especially in the US. This should change first and foremost.

* Recognition of gender changes are generally poor. The general legal consensus is that you need sex reassignment surgery to be recognised as your identified sex, but many cannot do this due to cost, contraindications or simply lack of faith in the technology (this is especially common in FtM phalloplasties). In some countries, you can have psychotherapy and live 2 years in full-time as your identified gender in order to get a Gender Recognition Certificate and have records back-dated. This is a better solution.

* Employment discrimination is a significant issue. All too often, people come out and get fired. 

* Lack of support facilities for transgender youth, especially with regards to mental health access. Also, homelessness is extremely prevalent in this group - I do not have a solution to this, but someone probably does.

* Lack of public awareness. We consider widespread discrimination against lesbians, gays, and bisexuals a civil rights issue; well, being both bi and trans, being trans is about 50x harder. I mean christ, there's so many programs which are pro-LGB but really hate the T (Glee, I'm looking at you). The lack of education I'm tempted to say is a significant causative agent, and really should be dealt with."

What this means is you're not doing anything wrong or bad but you're not doing anything exceptionally well either.

More specifically for your video:

I liked the cuts you made (the whole Law and Order sound was great).  But the whole video was pretty ho-hum. Most of it was just simply walking around. I liked how you made it semi-interesting by cracking jokes throughout but for me, it didn't do enough to keep me entertained. 

It's hard to judge a Let's Player by only one episode (especially if it's from the middle of a whole series).

I also read **A Monster Calls** by Patrick Ness and cried like a child. My boyfriend was really worried about me, watching me sob as I read the last quarter of it. Beautiful, really touching book, and very much recommended.

This week I'm reading **Red Rising** by Pierce Brown. It comes out on the 28th January, but I have the ARC for it. Looking good so far. Still listening to **Rivers of London** (Midnight Riot in the US), but should finish this week.

I have a review blog that is going up tomorrow; I'll post a link in the Week 3 thread, but when it is up, I'd love some feedback on my reviewing style. I'll also be hosting a giveaway of the illustrated A Monster Calls, for anyone interested, on the blog next week. Very nervous about the launch!"

beefcakez,bodybuilding,1388965495.0,"&gt;I've seen the many posts and notice the pointlessness of it all.

I agree wholeheartedly, which is why this is in the sidebar of /r/naturalbodybuilding:

*""Doubts and speculations regarding the natural-status of another bodybuilder will never be enough to prove if that someone is truly ""natural"" or not, only drug testing and self admittance of using banned substances will.*

*Comments and posts regarding such do nothing except create an environment where many aspiring bodybuilders falsely accept the idea that only through non-natural methods is it possible to attain a desirable physique.""* 

The ""natty or not"" question only derails threads and positive discussion, so I don't allow it in that sub. 

Like someone else posted in this thread, there probably aren't more than 500 actual ""users"" in /r/bodybuilding, but they are the loudest and most frequent (and agressive) of the group. They set the tone, and unfortunately, it's gotten to the point that the natural guys don't post or comment much because they shitstorm they face as a result. 

Not giving up on /r/bodybuilding. I love this place and the discussions/information that is presented here. I hope that it can steer away from the attitude it's more recently adopted.

2. Tajh Boyd-Has all the talent to be in the McNair and McNabb mold, but there I'm still not sure how he'll do when he has to make reads past Sammy Watkins.

3. Logan Thomas-Very inconsistent, but his pocket poise is amazing, arm strength is the best in the draft, and when he's on, he's got top 2 accuracy in the draft. If he were always on, he could be a top-five draft pick. Apparently, he's been working on progressions and mechanics, and depending on how this all comes out, he could rocket himself to the top of the 2nd round. Also, one of the [best power runners in the draft.](https://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/large/830972365.gif?1388521124) (Also, has experience as a TE, so if all else fails.)

4. AJ McCarron-Has no real weaknesses, but no real strengths. Reminds me a lot of Alex Smith.

5. Brett Smith-Hell of an athlete, and decently accurate, but could easily bust in the NFL because of all the adjustments he's going to have to make. Doesn't make it much past his first read, weird mechanics, and works in a system offense, he reminds me a lot of a much less refined Johnny Manziel.

6. Jimmy Garoppolo-Simply put, he has great tools, but he is at best inconsistent in his reads, I've noticed him staring down receivers constantly. Also, if Teddy was getting supposedly criticized for playing in the AAC, what does playing in FCS do for Garoppolo.

Then why not compete without them? I do agree with /u/maria340, I think beauty pageants should do their best to screen out contestants who had cosmetic surgery done, if you have what it takes to win it you should be able to do it without the help of a surgeon. 

It's like competing in sports using only your body's natural ability and hard work training versus doing all those things AND using performance enhancing drugs. Someone using performance enchanting drugs doesn't erase the fact that they have natural ability in a certain sport and put a lot of work into training but it does make it unfair on contestants who don't use those and promotes a dangerous thing, same as cosmetic surgery, by telling people that their natural ability/beauty/determination etc. is just not good enough even if they do have that natural ability/beauty etc. 

Basically what it does is say: ""Yeah, you're beautiful/hardworking/talented/whatever but you'd do so much better if you just got this surgery/took this drug"". Story of Julie Chen who was forced to have cosmetic surgery to advance her newscaster career is a prime example of that. "

The first one I was put on was recommended to me by my gynecologist to prevent the horrible ovarian cysts I kept getting. It was a low-dose combination pill and the first two weeks I was on it I had decreased appetite and nausea. After two weeks I had no more of those side effects.

The second pill I tried was also low-dose combination and for one week I had mood swings and some mild depression. After that week I had no more of those side effects. 

In both cases, birth control pills eliminated all of my PMS symptoms, successfully prevented ovarian cysts, and gave me a shorter, lighter period. On the first pill I tried I only had my period once every 3 months. On the second pill I had a regular period every month, just light and only lasted 3 days.

Hi Antimatter, I'm not upset with you I would just like to clarify a few things. I've done BDSM before, in fact, my gf asked me to do it my first time. I'm primarily the dominant one. BDSM is done for many reasons, not just to act out rape scenes, but rape scenes are one possibility. 1) for variety, 2) for the emotional intensity, 3) to explore something new. 

I just want to ask everyone not to assume anything about BDSM, and the whole spectrum of BDSM from mild to wild, because everything you've learned from TV and movies is probably wrong. The book ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" got a LOT of criticism from the BDSM community because it did BDSM so awfully.  The writer clearly had no experience with ""safe and sane"" BDSM. 

For me, it's just acting, and I like the intensity, the sharing of something deep and primal and primitive. 
That's all.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1388965928.0,"Welp, first I'm gonna say it's kinda stupid to assume that there would be mass quittings if UBI were implemented, especially when it would barely be enough to support oneself.

I will say in some ways it would provide more motivation than our current welfare system provides, which takes away incntive to work by punishing you financially for doing so. When you make the transition from welfare to work you basically face a 100% effective tax rate, as welfare is pulled out from under you and your wages merely substitute what you got. On the other hand, since UBI is unconditional, you get it even if you work. 

Second, there's not a lot of actual statistical evidence suggesting people would work that much less. Most studies showed that outside of new mothers and teenagers, there was little difference in work levels. A US study had like 17% reduction, which isn't that large at all, and even this could be overblown because researchers suspected people may have lied to get higher benefits (that study did the NIT version). Some studies, particularly in the third world, actually noted an increase in working hours if I'm not mistaken.

Third, even if people do quit, many of the jobs are being outsourced and automated anyway. Getting some to quit the work force may actually help the economy for the rest who choose to participate, because there aren't enough jobs out there for people anyway. Even if the ""work"" is there (which I've often heard claimed), no one is actually willing to pay for it, so it doesn't get done. UBI might help this in some limited cases because it may allow some to choose their passion, rather than join the corporate machine of selling more crap people don't need (which is what the majority of jobs I see have to do with nowadays).

Fourth, UBI would be implemented slowly, and if the amount of people who quit becomes too high, it could be scaled back in its implementation stages.

Fifth, I think you demonstrated the problem with the current system. People are very gently coerced to work these jobs, knowing full well if they did not they would starve. This leads to exploitation, which UBI would help mitigate."

Diece,leagueoflegends,1388966020.0,"While I appreciate the time and effort it takes to make something like this I must say I absolutely hate tier lists they are just a compilation of whats being played and if some pro plays something unconventional in a tournament and does really well in it everyone just hops on the bandwagon and does the exact same thing a pro does. Another reason is it sort of stagnates the meta, now everyone is going to play the champions that are strong and won't really try new things or explore different options. 

There is probably a ton of secretly strong champions or builds but few people will actually discover them because they would rather stick to whats ""strong"" right now. I wonder what people thought when players started to run mundo top and shyv right when 3.14 was released before they were popular. Basically what I'm getting at is in order to find out whats strong you need to branch away from what is currently strong but tier lists don't promote change. If that made any sense."

We can agree to disagree or maybe I'm just nicer but I believe in this case they aren't shit birds, just ate the fuck up. 

My train of thought as to why they aren't shit birds is that they are still in BCT. They haven't fine tuned their Soldiering skills, situational awareness,  hell, they probably have no idea as to what PCC/PCIs even are. I've always thought of a shit bird/blue falcon as someone who fucks up on purpose/flat out don't GAF and the PLT or CO pays for it. These guys obviously are nervous (it might be from the fact 3 DSs are behind them filming but by week 4 I was totally comfortable having those psychos around me as im sure you were to ), probably tired and the black guy did have the face of ""oh shit I fucked up"" so it's not like he did it on purpose. Yes, I do believe in smoking (I cannot believe this new Army is trying to do away with it. I was smoked all the way from BCT, to Medic AIT to my 1st and 2nd unit. Hell, even in Korea!) and it will teach them that sleep is for the weak. I will point out that I nearly had a stroke when I saw that one PVT just lob that grenade without any idea as to the location of his target. That was a big no no. But again,  they are cherrys and hopefully their first REAL unit buffs that out of em. 

Again, this is just my honest opinion and I apologize for the 13 yo comment.

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1388966126.0,"CHAPTER 15: So last time we ruined all of Erik’s hope and dreams, and then wow, does Heath really show up this early in Hector’s path? Oh I guess not he’s leaving. Wow this map doesn’t have many units on it. I don’t get many either so I guess that’s fair. I bring the lords, Priscilla (sorry Serra, not good enough), Matthew, Oswin, Rebecca, Erk, Guy, and Marcus.

Marcus is mostly there to make sure that I don’t lose by sitting on the throne the entire map. I start him, Guy, and Erk off to the side though, because he can get inside pretty easily and escort the two frailer characters. Opening either of those doors seems like a trap that gets me flanked later, so I don’t.

I notice one of those motherfuckers up north has a door key, so that door belongs to Oswin now. I get Marcus to pick up Erk and drag him to safety while Hector, Eliwood, Guy and Matthew make the flimsiest fucking wall you have ever seen. Luckily the knight only sees the big numbers he could get if he hit Matthew and neglects to notice his chance to hit.

I manage to mostly wipe out that wave of units and even feed some of my lesser used ones – Rebecca and Guy need levels fast, as do Eliwood and Erk to a lesser extent. Then I slowly start pushing along towards the source of the merc and myrmidon reinforcements, never quite managing to have a defensive line for my units to hide behind. Meanwhile Oswin is basically charging the boss by himself. Unfortunately that boss has like a billion move and notices guy all the way on the other side of the map and takes a crack, but Guy dodges and wouldn’t have died anyway! It’s the last turn so hector tries to take the boss himself but can’t get within wolf beil range.

Meanwhile Matthew found some presents for future Hector and future Priscilla. I weather the last turn easily and wish that I had one more turn for Hector to take a swing at the boss, but ah well. That was a pretty tense chapter I have to say. I had to let Priscilla of all people tank a hit just so that Guy wasn’t in danger of dying.

CHAPTER 16: Castle Caelin has gone down so Hector acts as the best wingman and goes to save Eliwood’s crush. And I finally get like all my good units back! Except they aren’t quite as good anymore. C’est la vie. Florina lands on Hector and I start my shipping engine up. Choo choo, all aboard the FlorinaxHector express, next stop A rank.

Have those peg knights always been on this map? Rebecca’s gonna have fun with them. I bring the same group as last time, + Bartre and Lowen. They’re mostly going to see duty as extra meat-shields for my still relatively frail party. Florina’s arrived and she’s ready to end some lives, man I love the peg knights in this game. She’s forced to head directly south to stop that thief, and wow Merlinus is in a much better position in Hector’s Route. Bartre and Matthew are going to guard him, everyone else is just gonna grind through the enemy slowly.

Meanwhile with all my old units, Sain is gonna head straight for the village in case the thief runs that way, while everyone else goes shopping. I spend most of my money on lances because everyone’s running low.

The thief annoys the shit out of my by stealing a vulnerary from Eliwood but Matthew’s almost capped speed at this point so he steals the lockpicks in return. Meanwhile Guy’s knocked to 1 hp by a couple peg knights and a merc, so Rebecca cleans up the peg he didn’t finish and he backs away from the front lines a bit for health. Lowen and Oswin tag-team the thief and he bites the dust, while Florina visits the village. The ballista is seriously pissing me off down south, managing to nail Lyn in a forest and knocking her down low on a 25% chance to hit, yes I checked.  Meanwhile I park Marcus next to Merlinus because did you know these guys had a support? I sure as fuck didn’t but they do so I’m going to grind it now while I can, just to see it. Kent rescues the village Sain was valiantly defending, while I move a vulneraried Lyn onto the same forest she was hit in before because I don’t learn. She dodges this time though. 

South group minus Lyn meets up with West group and I dick around on that ledge trying to feed Rebecca more kills. Florina gets more strength in the process and I notice she has 16 speed at level 9. Awesome. She shows me how awesome it is when she dodges an arrow from the Archer who must have moved forwards like 1 fucking square I swear but it wouldn’t have killed her anyway so it totally doesn’t count as a tactical fuck up.

Ballista man finally runs out of bolts so Lyn runs to meet up with everyone and get some sweet sweet conversations. Rebecca shows me how much she likes me by gaining strength, speed and skill all in one level. Then she lures in a peg knight holding a javelin, dodges it, and two-shots her handily. Some cavs spawn gunning for Merlinus and I’m like “game, I’ve barely even moved out of my starting area yet”. Florina with the horseslayer helps Sain and Bartre out in killing them, then I notice that that isn’t quite fast enough so I send Erk up to help.

After that wave of reinforcements and Hector and Oswin’s B support, I realise that neither the archer or the mage left on the map can reach the ballista nearest the boss, which is unused. So I fly Florina carrying Rebecca in in an effort to get her more kills. The mage totally cheats and dodges two of the bolts, but Rebecca lures him over and snags the kill anyway.

The support conversation between Merlinus and Marcus is simultaneously quite boring and incredibly worth the effort. Hector’s conversation with Florina is just incredibly kawaii. Eliwood and Lyn are uh… eh? It’s alright I guess. Same quality as Marcus/Merlinus without the idea of the support being hilarious to me so. Hector, rolls up to the boss with his supports and Priscilla, and crits the ever loving shit out of Bauker with the Wolf Beil. Then I decide to support Rebecca and Sain, even though my Sain is behind in speed and strength. I’ll probably drag him along to endgame, and he has time to make it back, especially with a 60% strength growth.

Anyway then Lyndis is a total jerk to Hector even though he just destroyed Bauker and I’m pretty sure she can’t even damage him. Oh then her granddad was almost killed.

CHAPTER 17: SHIT LETS SIEGE A CAST- wait hang on a sec, the doors are open? Oh I guess we’ll just wander on in then. Wow there’s a lot of fucking archers on this map, Florina’s probably not a good choice.

SHE’S COMING ANYWAY.

Alright so we’re going to charge as fast as we can towards Raven and his best friend who he leaves in the cell to rot so Priscilla can recruit him. Matthew is gonna have a fun detour to those close treasure chests which he can probably handle by himself if I’m being honest. I’ll just hand him an extra vulnerary. Oswin and Marcus will be guarding Merlinus – Marcus honestly just to get his support up because I still find that hilarious.  Everyone else (Sain, Florina, Eliwood, Hector, Rebecca, Erk, Guy) are going to murder everything that stands between Priscilla and her brother.

Turns out Marcus and Merlinus had gotten enough support to go up 2 levels last map because the second I assign him to guard the tent support pops up. They bond over fucking pastries this is surreal as shit.

Anyway I blaze up the side corridor and a thief spawns just as florina gets within range to stop him from stealing all my shit.

So that’s something. I manage to recruit Raven because I actually figure out that that random merc was the character I’m here to recruit. By this point the soldiers start to leave, but Raven isn’t murder crazy anymore so they’ll be fine. Then holy shit, do I really need ANOTHER FUCKING TUTORIAL. We were totally done with this. I’ve met this character before and used his light magic, against shamans. Stop.

Luckily Florina and Hector’s B support comes up and omg you guys they’re so good together. Matthew finishes looting his two chests down bottom, but I don’t have to wait for him to come back up because Erk killed an archer through the wall and someone got a key? Good thing he’s fucking magic or I’d have a hard time believing that shit.

Raven recruits Lucius, and the shaman start pouring out. I really need to kill them the turn they spawn or they nuke the soldiers and I lose good items. Luckily Guy is up to the challenge. I have Sain run up to one of the soldiers and it turns out he has a fucking conversation? Never seen this before. Turns out it’s Sain being an arsehole and telling them to fucking charge the boss. They’ll be murdered Sain. I’m having him, Eliwood and Priscilla ~~abduct~~ protect the soldiers, while I drop hector on the boss cause cmon.

Before Hector takes on the boss, I have Raven ~~waste all of his weapon uses~~ gain valuable exp by standing in front of the boss (who loves using his axe on the sword wielding raven) and chipping at him.  I get SainxRebecca to B and Lyn totally cock-blocks Sain. Raven gets a bunch of great levels so I let him support with his sister. Gettin’ a strong Eirika/Ephraim vibe from these two, but it makes Raven awesome, so w/e. Hector absolutely shits all over this boss, and I seize. Leila saves the day, hooray!"

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1388966137.0,"CHAPTER 17x: Let’s do it. I have 2 massive tanks which is just awesome for this level because there’s 2 choke points. One on the bottom with a killing edge boss horse who will melt before Oswin’s horseslayer, and one at the top which will be significantly more interesting to hold especially considering my 1 healer.

Lyn and Guy will head up and deal with the shit pirates then probably get some levels at the arena cause their lagging and Lyn’s gonna be my first promoted Lord (eat shit Eliwood). Florina will fly around like a mad woman, visiting all the villages, getting cool stuff, and then eventually pulling off the mage so that Hector doesn’t get nuked by it. I don’t go quickly on this fucking map. Oswin will have Erk ranged support when he can, while Hector will have Rebecca on the village and Lucius. Or maybe the other way around, depends on who has higher avoid – they’ll go on the village.

Oh shit that’s right you get Canas this map. He can help Erk with Oswin, I was worried. Man they seriously give you a fucking short bow that’s insulting. And a devil axe. Oh shit on hectors route that horse guy charges you straight up. That’s terrifying. Luckily my walls are awesome, so I get to deal with them separately to the pirates. They happen  to knock Florina down to 12 then she dodges the nomad’s arrow shot (woulda been lethal) but honestly that’s barely worth a restart. All I woulda learned I learnt before they ran up and almost murdered Florina. Florina gets heals then peels the mage for me. Alright. Drop a save state because I can do these steps over and over, advance Oswin.

Man I rock their fucking shit. Noone crits me, no one is out of position, I have to heal oswin once when the shaman hits him. I clean them up in 2 turns.

So uh. I guess we support a bit? Florina and Hector get up to A (:333333), Guy gets up to level 11 in the arena, still has 6 strength, and rams headfirst into the bench. Lyn hits 11 and has 9 strength which is why Guy has slammed into the bench.	Canas gets a good level spread over the course of 2, but Erk is actually pretty bad so I’ll take him. Lucius also got a couple great levels. Then we finish.

Fuck you Eliwood why are you panting so hard you sat back and fucking watched. Asshole.

CHAPTER 18: Aw this is a really cute conversation. YOU’RE STILL NOT TAKING HIM AWAY FROM FLORINA, YOU HUSSY.

Hehehe Dart you so nervous. I wonder who you’re going to support with. Oh shit enemy boats! Okay, Fargus, you handle all of the enemies with your massively inflated stats, Dart will direct everyone below decks to handle repairs. Right?

Ugh fine, I guess I’ll do this awesome fun chapter. Canas and Lucius will solo most of the left side, with Matthew following behind to steal the speedwings from Zoldam and Florina to evac him. Raven and Oswin will hold down the bridges, with Sain and Hector providing range support and a body to block with if shit goes wrong. Eliwood and Lyn will go shopping and get a B-support, then head down to the bottom to block off that boat when it arrives. On turns 5, 6, and 7 there are literally no enemies on the map apart from Zoldam. Then finally the enemies arrive down the bottom and test my defences. Eliwood and Lyn finally get their support and Eliwood hits on her pretty hard. She uh. She doesn’t reciprocate that well.

I get the last turn and have Matthew and Florina murder the shit out of Zoldam.

“Hey let’s take the amnesiac with no fighting ability to the Dread Isle where the people who were hunting her live.”

“K.”

Chapter 19: Heh, “His only redeeming factor is his sturdiness”. Love you Fargus, would be happy to run through your terrible gauntlet again some time. Oh no Leila. You were uh. Kinda fucked there. Matthew I’d really like to give you time to grieve buddy, but you have to hold the torch so I can see everything.

Turns out I accidentally narrowed my roster down to exactly 12 units with the benching of Erk and Guy, which is pretty great. I mean it’s instantly going to expand when Fiora arrives but what can you do? Can’t grind for supports on this map, but w/e. Lucius and Raven are going to go to the northeast; Marcus is going to guard the convoy (Oswin is sitting out because he’s stupid high level); Dart, Rebecca, and Matthew are going to handle the middle; and everyone else (The lords, Sain, Florina, Canas, Priscilla) are going to push south then east.

Woah Rebecca outright tells you she should support with Dart. Tough shit missy, you and Sain are getting up to A whether you like it or not. Merlinus and Marcus complete their A-support and it is by far the shittiest support series I have ever seen. A++ would drag Marcus along on a bunch of maps again.

Florina runs off on her own and I manage to murder a thief carrying a torch staff I didn’t even know was on this map until Matthew used a torch. Sain sends it to the convoy, Priscilla picks it up, and we begin operation torch spam – who needs fog of war anyway? Fiora, predictably, doesn’t go directly south like she does in every other game and charges the 2 nomads in the middle. Luckily I manage to get Florina over there to recruit her but jeez that coulda been messy.

Anyway the rest of the map goes pretty smoothly – Marcus not being able to kill the pirate reinforcements in one hit means Merlinus gets a little dinged up, but Marcus actually fucking levels and gains a point of speed, so he starts doubling them. Guess who’s never coming out again, buddy. I get to Uhai pretty easily, draw the longbow with hector, wolf beil Uhai down to 7 hp and murder him with Fiora and the horse slayer."

Wellll, people should know there's a whole range of ""violence"". Technically, if I spank my gf on the butt one time, that's the mild end of violence. But she consented to it anyway. BDSM is not always choking and cutting of someone's airway or slapping them on the face, like TV shows.

The shadows right now don't make you look haggard or tired or anything like that. Were you to end up lightening them anyway, I would do it just barely, since your face looks pretty much perfect as it is (as in, you can't tell there's makeup on it at all, and you look excellent) "

jammhamm,AskWomen,1388966514.0,"I guess if you put it that way it makes more sense. But my family is very judgmental. I've tried to avoid them looking at my armpits because when  they do they mention the black spots, that it doesn't look good and that I should do something about it. 

When I was younger I would feel horrible about myself because I felt like I was never pretty enough for them but now when they mention something about my appearance I just tell them to stop bothering me about that because it's no big deal. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that my dad is kinda sexist."
Esoteric_Indulgence,TwoXChromosomes,1388966515.0,"I have an anxiety disorder, so I've been living with irrational anxieties for yeaaaars. Only problem is since the root of my anxiety is a psychological issue, it doesn't matter how much evidence there is proving I'm not pregnant because I'll continue to fear that I am anyway. Used HBC and condoms flawlessly? Got my period on time? Doctors say I'm not pregnant? Doesn't matter, still think I'm pregnant. 

But then, I'm like that about a lot of things since my disorder affects everything in my life. It's a struggle, but believe it or not I'm a lot better than I was 4 years ago. Reminding myself of reality and reciting all the reasons why I'm not pregnant over and over again sometimes helps. Just have to keep myself out of my head, so to speak."

-You told him NO to anal, he did it anyways and really, really hurt you.

-You tried to talk to him about it and gave excuses, ""I am not turn on by you unless you cannot give consent.""

In short, he only cares about his sexual needs and desires.  He does not respect you, your boundaries and is no longer attracted to you as a person but as a victim.

I agree with others, you were raped.  Add all the points above and you have someone who disrespects you in pretty much every way that matters.

If you want to continue this relationship (which I am not sure why you would) you may want to make it clear that if he EVER does anything like this again: you will press charges for sexual assault.

Seriously, it doesn't matter how great of a relationship you have outside of this issue... this is a very big issue to have in the first place.

2 years later, I STILL don't have the MK3A1 n BF3 because i haven't gotten so many kills with a certain APC on certain maps or something dumb like that. On BF4, I'm probably never gonna unlock shotguns or snipers that much, since you need to specifically use these gun classes to unlock them, and unless you have all these good unlocks, the weapons just aren't that good and therefore there's little incentive to use them. And then you need to unlock the attachments separately for each gun, making it where you need to get hundreds of kills to unlock everything on a single gun. It's just silly. I do understand where you're coming from though. It's just gotten MUCH MUCH worse with the new BF games. This BF4 unlock garbage (me spending like 4 hours grinding today to get the most out of the double xp weekend) is what inspired me to make this. It's just getting out of hand."

The duty roulette, player commendation, higher mythology cap, CT, and new high level dungeons give you so much gear without putting pressure on you to perform at veteran player levels. I haven't seen many ragers in this game as I did in WoW for making dungeon runs take 5-10 minutes longer than usual.

Definitely focus on getting your relic/relic+1 weapon which shouldn't be a problem anymore since they created party-finder. Also no one ever competes for rolls (the green gear) in level 50 dungeons, so that gets you satisfactory armor and accessories to beat any primal hard mode."

I have never been physically attracted to a man who is 60 years old, and I think it's close to impossible for a girl my age to be genuinely physically/sexually attracted to a man of that age. Some women my age may be interested in much older men for other reasons (e.g. money, security, perhaps emotional attraction). But since the only thing you are offering is sex, women won't be interested unless they find you physically attractive. I think it's extremely rare for a woman in her twenties to be physically attracted enough to a 60 year old man to have casual sex with him.

In terms of how to go about this without pissing people off: post an ad on craigslist casual encounters and cross your fingers, but be aware that 98% of responses will be from women with ulterior motives (money, green card, money, free dinners, money). 

Don't message young women on dating sites unless they specifically state that they are interested in men your age. Back when I was online dating in my late teens and early 20s I used to get messages and emails from much older men and it simply annoyed me (and gives all men on dating sites an unfairly bad reputation). Occasionally I would even forward the emails (with the guy's pics) to friends for a laugh. So tread carefully unless you want to risk ending up as an internet meme."

Maybe, maybe not.  There isn't reliable evidence in any direction.

Jourdin,Dogtraining,1388967450.0,"&gt; My partner has never really upheld her commands though, even when alone.

Well then this is your problem. *No matter* the training style, consistency is key. How is the dog supposed to know what to do if he or she can't know what to expect from you? You seem to understand that, at least.

I honestly don't know for sure why your dog tends to respond to your commands (I prefer to use the word ""cue"" but ya know what I mean so whatever) with more frequency than your partner's commands. I feel like... I could come up with some ideas, but I don't have a conclusive answer. This is why I am studying dog behavior! Because I *want* to know! :) The one thing that comes to mind, though, is this: When your dog nips at you, you push her down. She does not like being pushed down. So she does not nip you, because she has come to learn that nipping you = something unpleasant, but nipping your partner = nothing really. This is typical of an animal that learns through conditioning, and has a lot to do with the four quadrants of conditioning (positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive punishment, negative punishment). I could go on about why she nips in the first place, but I'll stop because as you can probably tell from my other comments on this post, I can be prone to long-windedness ;)

As far as your other question, yes, dominance theory has been disproven for all dog breeds, and for wolves as well! I linked to a few articles about that in my comment to the OP: [The Flawed Alpha Wolf Theory](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/the-flawed-alpha-wolf-theory.html), [The Alpha/Dominance Theory Myth](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/dominance-theory.html), and [Whatever Happened to the Term Alpha Wolf?](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/pdf/alpha-wolf.pdf). I highly recommend all 3 of those articles; the first two are pretty quick reads, but they're all worth your time, in my opinion! Mals, though they *look* more like wolves than most dog breeds, are not actually any closer in relation to wolves than any other dog breed. Again, I'd go on, but I've already gone on for two paragraphs, lol. Plus, I can't explain it nearly as well as someone who has done more extensive research. If you're interested in further reading, the book [Dogs by Raymond Coppinger](http://www.amazon.com/Dogs-Understanding-Canine-Behavior-Evolution/dp/0226115631/) is a really, really great resource. The subtitle of the book is ""A New Understanding of Canine Origin, Behavior and Evolution,"" and it explains how dogs are related to wolves and yet why we should not compare the two as much as we do (they are two different species, after all!). I'm currently reading it and totally loving it; Coppinger is a biologist, so you know he's done his research and is a credible source, but he still writes in a way that is accessible to a layperson.

Feel free to PM me if you want further discourse, I obviously love to talk about this, hehe."

Why would you make the intro that long if you aren't confident with it? I personally love that soft, cinematic intro but you could use some more 'ear-candy', if you will. Atmospherics, fx, delayed cymbals etc as it is lacking a whole lot of interest after a few seconds.

It's not about telling people with artificial procedures that they are less of a person but rather telling people who do not want/cannot afford them that *they* aren't less of a person because of that which is what this whole industry which promotes going under the knife does. So many girls get hurt or die because they go to these dodgy places to get cheap cosmetic surgery because they feel they *need* it in order to feel good about themselves or in order to advance their career. Younger and younger girls go on diets and suffer from body dysmorphia because of what the media promotes. 

The media plays a very powerful role and I think beauty pageants and women's magazines especially should promote natural beauty, not airbrushed/plastic beauty. Our modern society has more mental disorders to do with appearance than ever before and its only getting worse, so why promote all these toxic ideas? If you want to get a nose job, cheek implants, boob implants, filler in your lips etc. that's your choice, you are not less of a person for it, but in my opinion this artificial look should never be promoted as the ideal that everyone should aspire to but it is. 

&gt;Which sports depend on only your natural ability? Most rely on performance enhancing drugs.

One of my visits I arrived the last day of February. The week prior it snowed. Every. single. day. We were so nervous about our trip. On the day we arrived, it was sunny and there was snow melting everywhere. 

At dusk, just as we were starting up in the elevator on the Eiffel Tower, it began to rain. When we popped out of the elevator, everyone oooh'd and ahhhh'd like crazy because the rain up there was snowflakes. If you recall the Dance of the Sugar Plum fairies in that old Walt Disney movie, they looked just exactly as fluffy and dancing as those in the lights at the top of the tower.  At the bottom of the tower, they had turned back into rain. This is my absolute favorite memory of Paris.

The rest of the week was sunny shirtsleeve weather by day, a light jacket needed at dusk. There was not any further significant cold weather that spring.

The following year we were there in mid-March for three days and it snowed and sleeted and freezing rained every day.

Good luck to you! Perhaps it will warm early this year."

So if it's a formal wedding where a $50-100+ gift is expected the fact that the couple can't bother sending a formal invitation doesn't really seem right. It's all about etiquette.  A low end affair on the other hand that's clearly meant to be just a get together celebration (the best kind by the way) can be as informal as it wants.  What I'm hearing more about lately though isn't so much the lack of invitations but the lack of thank you cards which is incredibly rude if you ask me.

Besides that, see the top comment in this thread: pointing out the positives (or even not-yet-realized-but-still-potential positives) of a person before pointing out the wrongdoings can often have a much better effect on fixing the problem than just saying, ""You're a bully"".  Maybe this girl will remember that her mom still thinks she's kind and caring, will remember this lesson, and will work harder not to disappoint her mother more than that.  Even if this is not an immediate effect, her mother's punishment (which in my opinion is worded as well as possible) will undoubtedly be something that she remembers well into adulthood.

He'll complain about happy people, make jokes about people's appearance and/or mannerisms. It's mostly 'funny' but over time the total package is that he's just an asshole. 

You've been with this guy five years (going on six) and it's time to decide what kind of package deal this guy's bringing to the table. Have you told him, 'hey, look, why are you so negative all the time?' Maybe he exists in a bubble where you've given him opportunity to vent, and now you're his complaint-listener-to-person. Is he negative in front of friends and family? Is it something you think he can work on, or is it just a part of who he is and it will never go away? 

It's a hard situation. You clearly love the guy. But if I had to choose between being in love with a negative person or living a single life with super positive influences, I'd choose the positivity every time. Negativity just breeds more negativity and that feeling that you're being 'brought down' will only get worse (seriously -- my brother is my roommate and he bums me out the way he lives his life).

Anyway, when Lorkhan said ""you know what would be fun and totally won't kill us, I promise? Let's make a thing out of ourselves"", the Grey Maybe was segregated into three things. The Aedra made Mundus, which was a mix of Anuic and Padomaic energies and was the first instance of Color and Tone (in contrast to the white noise/color of Padhome and the black/quiet of Anu) in the universe. The Daedra who did not participate gathered their Padomaic energies and made realms inside themselves, but these realms were not Mundus and so did not have the Rainbow Music. They became Oblivion, and Aetherius is the leftovers, the swath of radiation and energy that was not used in Creation.

Tl;dr: Oblivion did not exist, by definition, until Creation happened, but the planes of Oblivion as we now know them were always there as part of the Grey Maybe - they are the minds/bodies of the et'Ada we call Daedra."

2. ""The gov't pays for it"" is an accountant's reasoning. No self respecting economist would think that way. The goal is to maximizing utility, not minimize cost on taxpayers. 

3. While a poorly designed direct transfer program (i.e., with excessively high effective marginal tax rates) could create a poverty trap, it is not necessarily so. If the clawback rate for the benefits is reasonable (i.e., under 50%), then there is not poverty trap. The way out of poverty is a nice slope. While it does introduce some discentive to work, so does every single anti-poverty measure. It's the cost of addressing poverty through anything that isn't economic growth."

After that, we had a collection of receivers who haven't caught 1000 yards between them in their career.  This limited our offensive production, and doubly so once Davis got hurt and missed a few games.

If we don't add any WRs this offseason, we'll have two legitimate receiving weapons: Davis and Crabtree.  After that, we'll have a collection of receivers who haven't caught 1000 yards between them in their career.  It is reasonably expected that this will limit our offensive production, and doubly so if either of them gets hurt.

Hence: we'd like some more weapons.  This could be re-signing Boldin, this could be Patton stepping up, this could be drafting someone in the first round.  Ideally, it'd be all 3.

Also note that we're not exactly long on other needs.  We need WRs, CBs, a S if Whitner doesn't re-sign, and a backup QB.  After that... the entire depth chart for our defensive front 7 is returning, 7 of our top 8 OLinemen our returning, and we have 4 good RBs and 2 good TEs.

pingveno,archlinux,1388968673.0,"Pros:

* Arch packages (PKGBUILD's) are very simple and easy to write.

* Arch policy is to assume that everyone is updated to the latest packages. That makes being on the bleeding edge less error prone.

* Arch can benefit upstream projects by providing a large body of early adopters.

* Arch users expect some instability. That makes them more willing to migrate to improved solutions. Example: systemd. The previous init system needed to be replaced. There was some grumbling, but most people weren't breathing fire over the move.

Cons:

* Arch's PKGBUILD format has relatively few layers of abstraction compared to many other formats. That makes Arch packages relatively inflexible. Case in point: Gentoo supports building the same package for multiple versions of Python straight from the main repositories. Arch depends on AUR packages for that, if they even exist.

* Arch users often don't appreciate how much Arch uses the work of other distros.

* You can't really use Arch for a low maintenance server.

* The /usr/bin/python -&gt; python3 switch was a horrible and impulsive move."

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1388968959.0,"I've watched a lot of the anime and can totally see the potential for fights. There are a couple of problems, though.

You can tell that the author really didn't have a plan for how he was going to develop skills and powers. Most of the fights in the beginning are gimmick fights; you've got your card user and your knife user and your fat guy and so forth. Now we're dealing with your more typical chi-based power levels.

This means that the way that fights work and the way that we measure their abilities is constantly changing. First we had gimmicks, then we had the different types of chi-users, now everyone is slowly becoming a specialist. It's just changing too radically and too quickly to be able to use it in a fight. 

Compare this to, for example, Fairy Tale. Sure, it's a long anime. But you only really need to watch one or two of a character's fights to have a decent grasp of how powerful they are, and those powers don't really change in particularly radical ways.

The other problem is accessibility. HxH is a long, long anime. And it's *very* shounen. It will occasionally delve into some mature themes, but the words ""friendship"" and ""teamwork"" are mentioned way too often for my liking.

I feel like Hxh will be a great series for /r/whouwouldwin when it's finished, but that's probably not going to be for a long time."

Bad idea: 

Correcting spelling or non-functional grammer.

example: ""Cn u pick up ice on the way? thx! :)""

nothing wrong here imho, i have not only a clear undestanding of what they're communicating, but also, a better sense of the mood/subtext of the sender per the smiley

Worst Idea: 

Claiming there is such a thing as 'proper' english (english, unlike french and spanish, has no authoritative body, nor has it ever. no authoritative body = no entity to make the rules = no rules)

Worstest idea: 
forgetting that words often have many different definitions

Worsterest idea: 
forgetting that dictionaries don't determine what words are, but rather, like biologists observing bonobo behavior, lexicographers simply jot down the ways the words are used, so there arectually is no 'official' spelling, or 'truest' defiition of a word according to any authority, but rather, it's just a documentation of usage. 

ADDENDUM: Just remember kids, because the people hiring you still care about these 'rules' of punctuation and grammer that are non functionally-minded, be sure to adhere to these archaic dogmas when writing in a professional context (i.e. emails to clients, resumes, etc).

- I always want to bring host gifts when I visit and especially stay over at someone's house. It's split on whether other Americans who been here for generations do or not, but those who do tend to bring alcohol. Like wine. Being Chinese, we like to give food. For souvenirs too, it's all foods! I remember a discussion with my white, middle American bf who thought it was weird I was flying to meet his parents with a cheesecake. Luckily they loved it! As odd as it may have been. Granted I think Chinese usually give fruits? Haha. 

- Filial piety. I was raised having to give my dad the respect that a dad deserves, however he's a deadbeat dad and always asking for money and other things. My American friends don't get why I even stay in contact with him or help him with paperwork (like taxes or insurance...his English is bad). But it's hard. To me he still deserves at least that I do this for him. Have not given money though. 

- Career. I graduated 4yrs ago, make good money with fairly consistent work as a freelance vfx artist, but my mom and her family still have these interventions. They gang up on me and tell me how I'm unemployed (freelance is not unemployed!) and made a huge mistake, that I should go back to school for pharmacy. Makes me sad and jealous of those with supportive parents. I ignore this but worry they may be right sometimes. So I work as much as possible, 12hrs per day can be normal, weekends are open. "

My self confidence isn't yet high, but it's come far from being at rock bottom, and near the end of 2012 I looked in the mirror and realized I liked myself for the first time in my life.

So my advise to build a positive self image is to focus on fulfilling your needs for empathy, appreciation and boundaries. (I developed empathy and appreciation, but boundaries has become the missing 'piece' of my positive self image puzzle it seems.)

I've discovered Journaling for 15-20 mins a day is a good way to change self-talk. 

I highly recommend 3 books to help with journaling:
 
Self compassion by Kristen Neff, Non-violent communication by Marshall Rosenberg, and The Language of emotions by Karla Mclaren. If you can only afford 1, I recommend Marshall Rosenberg's book.

You can then either apply the language principles in the 2nd person or first person towards yourself whilst journaling (I prefer first person). 

And in Karla Mclaren's book you'll other practices to help you develop boundaries and emotional awareness.

Hope that helps."

case fans are fine, a bit overpriced but if you want the quietness go for it. That PSU however, if you're not experienced in cable management go for it.

Maybe a system wherein every hour, the walls suction out any free-floating debris, including said waste. The waste would go through some kind of grating, and the chickens may be made to hug the walls while the suction's on, but will be turned right back off in 30 seconds.

And while the suction's on, there could be warm water-jets extending from the walls that spray the grating (and I guess the chickens) so that no debris / waste is left clinging on the grating.

To have chickens cleaned on the top of the hour every hour might make for a healthier dinner in the long run."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1388969558.0,"&gt;I think 5'10 or so is the upper limit usually they let you do it. Its not because there is science in it, but because over that height you cannot really claim you're at disadvantage anymore because of your height.

Not exactly. This is only true in the United States. I'm sure that a snake oil surgeon overseas would do this for a 6'1"" man if he could pay. These types of things happen all the time in less litigious countries. The reason most of these surgeons wouldn't do that in the a United States is that a botched surgery will look very bad to a jury if his patient were already average height or tall. But, if the patient is noticeably short, his lawyer can paint him as the sympathetic Doctor who was more of a humanitarian than a scam artist who preys on the insecure. "

Kaarage is an easy keto fix, it's basically fried chicken. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEX_rCVTPKE  Instead of flour, perhaps use pork rinds.

Tamagoyaki is an awesome addition and a Japanese favorite. Made without sugar, it's not very traditional, but delicious. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PrwJxZfBH8

Microwave chicken roll ups are easy and keto-friendly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgMIFDuZJSA

These are tasty even without rice. They are like tuna salad inside of a mini tomato. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpUjBomzYjs

Also meats, cheeses, veggies and your choice of fruit are suitable.

dianthe,fashion,1388969636.0,"&gt;I'm not angry, you're projecting. I just think people that judge other people suck.

We all make judgements on people, ideas, places, I thought you were angry because you were cussing which is something someone who is angry does. You are judging me at this very moment. My judgement on cosmetic surgery and airbrushing is that it is not an idea that should be promoted, this does not mean that I am judging people who Photoshop their every photo or who go under the knife, but I *am* judging the idea that this artificial look should be promoted as the ideal because, in my view, it does a lot of harm. 

&gt;How many girls suffer the unbearable plight of being a lower middle class housewife with no aspirations? Probably more than those that die under the knife.

How is this relevant to what we are discussing? It's like saying ""I think alcoholism in Russia is a big problem that needs our attention"" -  ""WHAT?! What about all the homeless children in third world countries?? There are way more of them!"". All that does is derail from the issue being discussed unto a completely different, unrelated issue. You didn't address any of the points I made. 

&gt;I'm not saying it's okay to cheat, but I am saying that steroids are more common than you think. 

I am sure it is plenty common (that is why athletes have to undergo mandatory drug testing) what I'm saying is that it is not ok and it is not a good thing. Not sure what marijuana has to do with any of it... "
MightySasquatch,Foodforthought,1388969640.0,"I just don't think it works for the reasons I stated. I also believe it's a cop-out for people who believe the government shouldn't assist the poor and the needy, 'oh well someone will take care of it'. There's no answer to 'what if they don't?', the answer is that they die. That's why I hate it.

The lobbyist argument is an argument for better government, not for no government.

In any case, this is mostly irrelevant. You have no philosophical problem with government, you support public works, apparently some technological development, police, fire, military, etc. So the only difference between our proposals is that they take less of a percentage of people's income, and provide less services. There is still a gun, and it's still 'stealing' if that's what you believe they are doing. 

So the only difference between our positions is whether you think those specific government programs are worthwhile.

As for money, yes I know what money is. I actually was an economics major. I wasn't arguing about money, I was using it as a shorthand for the system of distribution of resources called capitalism. People who disagree with the monetary system typically aren't criticizing the medium exchange, but the system that that machine operates in.

Edit: I conflated your arguments with a different responder, I'm not sure if you support public works or not. My mistake."

Rerichael,cigars,1388969641.0,"My worst travel experience would have to be when I was coming back from Basic Training for the Army. I didn't complete the training, because it had been discovered that I was actually starting to get deaf, and my hearing was below the Army standard. 

They give you a bus to the airport, and a ticket to wherever you came from. I got to the Airport in ATL, and discovered the ticket I got, was for a plane that left earlier that morning. Don't ask me why, that's just the Army for you. 

I was finally able to talk to someone who could help me, but since my ""ticket"" was actually a voucher through the Army, it was only good for certain tickets. They said it was something to do with recruits exchanging tickets out, and flying somewhere else, because the unit that sends you home holds both guys who got kicked out (me), and guys who quit. 

Long story short, it was about noon, and my flight back to Chicago wasn't leaving til 8am the next day. I didn't have any money, other than some cash I brought with me when I first got down to Georgia, so I couldn't eat anything but food court food, and pretty much had to entertain myself/sleep in the Atlanta airport for 20 hours. This is after I found out that I couldn't be in the Army anymore cause my ear wanted to quit on me. It wasn't a good month."

It turns the acrylic into permanent fabric paint, adds durability and is flexible so thus prevents cracking.  You just heat set the shoes when your done painting them, and thats it.  I find no need for a top coat of clear spray or anything.  This method makes the paint waterproof so technically you could put the shoes through the washer and dryer (though I suggest just spot cleaning the shoes with a bit of water, to optimize the life expectancy).  Of course, eventually they will wear over time, but by then, hopefully whoever owns them is ready for a new pair of custom shoes :)

Another thing I like about the fabric medium, is that it slightly thins out the paint, making it easier to do detail work :)"

Supposedly, when he went to France as a diplomat during the revolution, one of his colleagues on the journey was a very conservative man, the kind to be in bed at sun's set, and up with the dawn.  This clashed with Franklin's nature, and the two did not get on so well.  The story goes that, as the colleague would wake up some mornings and leave his room, he would bump into Franklin - getting back from another night out.  Couple that with him still serving as a successful diplomat, it paints a wonderful portrait of his character.

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1388969868.0,"Early churches probably didn't sit. I'm basing this on current Orthodox praxis, and that the Orthodox church is very reluctant to change anything. The praxis is based on a NT verse - something about ""standing before the Lord"", but I don't recall the detail.

In mediaeval times, some churches were built with stone benches at the bases of the walls for the use of the old - hence the saying ""the weakest go to the wall"". These can still be seen. In Britain at least (I think also more widely), monasteries had individual seats for the choir monks (as opposed to the lay monks), facing across the church. These can be folded up to allow more room for standing during some parts of the service, but a common feature is a ""misericord"", a small ledge which is at bum height when the seat is folded and the monk is standing. The word means ""pity"" or ""sympathy"", and was supposed to give some support during long services.

I'm not sure when pews for the congregation came in, but they seem to have been present in some parish churches prior to the Reformation hitting England.  My reason for saying this is that due to the increased important of preaching, some churches changed their seating layout to face a pulpit on what used to be the side of the church, so that the church was now wider than long, allowing the congregation to hear the preacher more easily. This was sometimes done imperfectly, so that some of the box pews face in the wrong direction still. 

A box pew, btw, is a pew with a door, and tends to have higher partitions than is needed purely to provide back support. These would be rented by a family. These were later replaced by lower open pews to be used on a first-come-first-seated basis, although you can still find churches with a mix of box and open pews. Box pews are generally found in older Anglican churches, but were probably more important in non-conformist churches at first, since they were not supported by tithes and had to find other forms of income. In Scotland, the annual auction of pews could cause some friction (see JM Barrie's *Auld Licht Idylls* for a fictionalised account)."

I would even say that Obama is more to the right than Cameron, but I think that is more to do with the US political system not allowing him to pursue the goals he wants- he has to present policy in such a way that the Republicans would support, whereas the British government always has a majority in Parliament so can do what it likes, barring a rebellion by backbench MPs. The gay marriage issue wasn't a party vote though, all MPs were able to vote using their own decisions and not an official party vote, and thankfully there are enough sane minds in Parliament for a resounding yes vote. 

Sorry for the political nerdery, I did politics at A Level and most of the course was comparing Britain and America. Our system is much better, even if it is less democratic, because the British government can do something but then answer for it later on in the election, whereas the American government can't pass laws unless the opposition party agrees to it.

That's why we have he wonderful NHS and the Americans don't. Even if Obama wanted to introduce a proper national healthcare system, he wouldn't be able to because it isn't popular enough to pass through Congress."

In your bathroom, a mirror shows you what you looked like less than a millisecond ago, a black hole 100 lights away could show you what earth was like 200 years ago. 2 million light years away shows earth as it was 4 million years ago, etc.

n3verlose,wikipedia,1388970284.0,"&gt;1) Drinking and driving is not an accident. Its like playing Russian Roulette, eventually someone is going to get hurt/killed and you cant claim oops when it finally happens

Are you trying to say that a 16 year old killed four people on purpose? Don't be ridiculous. It's criminally negligent manslaughter, not murder.

&gt;2) Someone very important in my life was sexually molested as a young child and never talked about it with anyone until their 30's. This is quite a common. Im surprised so many on reddit feel otherwise.

That's unfortunate, but with all due respect, your friend was never on trial for a school shooting. As a minor, something like that could significantly affect her sentence and the court should have talked to her about that before deciding to try her as a adult.

&gt;4) Sexual abuse or no sexual abuse, he should be locked up for not providing for a dependant (who thus went on to commit grave acts), and she should be allowed some form of something resembling a life.

I agree with this. She shouldn't have been tried as an adult. I just don't think it's fair to compare this case with the other one. The drunk-driving kid should have received a heavier sentence, but they are not the same crime.

oldneckbeard,wine,1388970284.0,"There's quite a bit, but in no particular order: 

1. People's insistence on continuing to use cork. It's killing our planet. I try to join wine clubs that only use synthetic cork or twist-off, but it's hard because so many people with money think of anything that's not cork as an inferior investment. 
2. The crazy markup drinking wine in a restaurant. I get it, there's overhead, but I'll never pay 50 bucks for a 12 dollar bottle of wine. Charge me 30, and I'll buy it. I actually don't drink wine at most restaurants because of this. I'd rather spend the money on beer or cocktails. There's no use for restaurant owners to be butthurt over this, it's just the truth. I don't care about your expenses, I care about my cost. And I'd buy a bottle of wine most meals if the markup was more reasonable. Or at least get a wine that I don't know. You can't be putting 50 dollars of Yellow Tail on the menu. That's just insulting all of us. 
3. The wine snobbery. It's still there. This ""I drink wine, all you beer drinkers are imbeciles"" kind of thinking. 
4. I wish there were more people doing 375's. 750 is a big investment in time, calories, and drunkenness when it's just two of you. I like to try as many new wines as possible, but the commitment required of one bottle is too steep to really explore as much as I want to.

snobord,AdviceAnimals,1388970296.0,"&gt;Ok, ok, **17.4%** of  prison population, you're totally right, and it changes **everything**. 

&gt;&gt; I'm not going to bother looking for the percentage of marijuana vs. other drugs.

&gt;Because it would contradict your agenda? For example, in California, possession of ounce and less is not even a crime, now tell me how prisons are full of poor joint smokers. 

&gt;Unless you actually believe that federal prisons are full of casual mj users. 

Right, because legalizing means only casual marijuana users are affected, not people who sell, transport, or otherwise distribute.

And nice casual ""overlooking"" of the 48% federal prison population there, because, you know, it doesn't make obvious how full of crap you are.

P.S. Just because something is only an infraction doesn't make it ""not a crime."" It's still very much a crime."

First, the Reddit hivemind instantly thinks that I'm trying to attack you or your content which is obviously not the case otherwise I wouldn't be in and subscribed to your subreddit.

Second, it is entirely possible that I misread you. If so, I have 2 questions. If you truly think this adds enough extra value to your video then why not do it on every video? I'm sure it doesn't take an awful lot of time to edit and better videos mean extra subscribers mean your livelihood is more secure.

Also, why didn't you shape your channel to be something centered on your ability to deliver witty remarks then? Something like [TheAuzzieGamer's Multiplayer Mayhem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsfuY3hSw-M&amp;list=SPDFC06D6376669C4C) or [Reynold Sanity's beautiful destruction of Rome II Total War](http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEpUCoVQvvo3ipCXUGcQ4kQ/videos) (Yes, I know this isn't a very good example.) for example.

As a conclusion, I will simply say **again** that **in my opinion** the edits didn't add anything. I personally watch your channel because I like your banter as well as your Internet persona. I do **not** come to your channel for your ability to deliver witty remarks. It's possible that other people liked this system better, if so, you might actually want to change the way you make your videos up, which is completely fine by me. You produce content, I watch your content. If I don't like your content then I will just stop watching it, not that anyone cares because you don't care about single fans, I am perfectly replaceable.

I merely observed a change in the way you made your video and I wanted to give an opinion/feedback on it. I'm pretty sure you can never have enough feedback when it comes to something as fickle as a Youtube livelihood."

abcd_z,TheRedPill,1388970431.0,"&gt; There is a statistically significant correlation between claimed partner count and claimed frequency of infidelity.  

Right.  

&gt; You have proposed that the relationship between the two variables is not causative and that the correlation is rather due to a shared common factor that was overlooked, namely misrepresentation in the survey.  

That... sounds right.  

&gt; If your hypotheisis is correct, then assuming that few women claim to have cheated when they have not,  

A reasonable asumption.  

&gt; your theory requires that 1) some women claimed that they have not cheated when they actually have  

Right.  

&gt; and 2) those women who lied more about their partner count were also more likely to lie about having not cheated.

That bit isn't necessarily supported by the texts, but I don't think anybody here would argue that assumption.  

I agree or tentatively agree with everything you've said in your comment, but nothing you've said builds an argument for the 13% ratio being reliable when the underlying premises are incorrect, or for your claim that ""the frequency of female infidelity is orders of magnitudes higher than we have been led to believe by the scientific studies conducted to date."""

I'm not making a counterpoint here, but this does bring up an interesting point about a Monarchy.  Although a somewhat abstract (and soft) point, absolute Monarchs can be in a sense quiet difficult to corrupt (which again, isn't to say it's impossible or it's never happened).

This only really applies in a very contemporary sense, but they have wealth, land, power, resources etc. so there is nothing for them to gain personally.  From one perspective there's actually nothing an absolute Monarch has to personally gain from their position except for approval.

I realize the situation is more nuanced than that, especially politically, but I've always found it an interesting idea.  If Prince William were to one day find himself with absolute legal power, I don't think there's really much of a reason for him to be ""evil"", for want of a better word, or even particularly oppressive.  The striking major flaw in a Benevolent Dictatorship is that ultimately it's the given ideology of the Head of State that rules.

Again, not to disagree with your point in the slightest.  Although when you say one can never institutionally control leader quality but you can replace them, that raises the fact that you can't control *institutional quality* (say, a two-party system) and replacing *that* non-violently is a very, very thorny prospect."

edselpdx,Frugal,1388970615.0,"I did it when we were a small family of 3 (the now-Teen was a babe.) It was worth it for diapers back then. I went recently just to look around and price compare, and was sorely disappointed for a few reasons. 

* I found that while the Kirkland brand things were cheaper on average, many items were only available in brand names, so while Costco was cheaper for name brands compared to the grocery store, it still came up short against generics and sales at other stores; I don't buy Hunt's brand canned tomatoes at Safeway, so why is it a ""deal"" to get that name brand for cheaper if I would have bought the store brand (or Muir Glen organic) at Safeway? Things like TP *can* be a good deal, but aren't necessarily a good deal. 

* Organic foods were significantly lacking, despite this being Portland. I buy things like organic milk which were NOT available at the one I looked at. I'm not obsessive about organic, except in things we eat/drink in large volume, like milk. 

* Thirdly, we live in an older home with limited storage, and have limits on how quickly we can consume perishables. Granted things that can be frozen are one thing, but you can't buy one gallon of milk, you have to buy a 2-pack of gallons. I don't need a 3-pack of smoke detectors, only one of ours needs replacing, etc. When I open an industrial sized can of tomatoes, half will be wasted. If I want smoked salmon, buying 1/4 pound makes more sense than 2 pounds at a time, even with the cost per pound being better at Costco. So for a small family, it doesn't always make sense. I really don't need half and half by the gallon.

* An issue I had when we did shop there regularly, was that I always spent more than I had budgeted. I realize that this is my own quirk, but I couldn't get out of there for under $400 a decade ago. (""Those sheets are such a deal--I should get 2 sets!"") It encouraged me to overspend and overconsume.


So, while I respect their business practices, and agree that for some it is a good deal, it isn't the right frugal choice for me and my family."

This goes for both genders to be fair, but it seems like it could be especially true for women. There isa correlation between partners and marriage success: http://socialpathology.blogspot.com/2010/09/sexual-partner-divorce-risk.html  

You're linking to one of the posts I mentioned without addressing my argument that the fundamental nature of the information-gathering is flawed.  If the survey results are unreliable, then it can't be used as a reliable argument.  

&gt; It seems there's a not-quite-articulated argument on the pro-OP side here that a girl with ""slut personality"" and a woman with a modest personality are equally liable to cheat. This is based on the statistical law-of-averages fact that an honest women reporting 10 partners is the same as a lying woman reporting 5.  

I'm not saying anything of the kind.  I'm just saying that there's no reliable evidence in any direction: slutty, non-slutty, or otherwise.  

&gt; the honest slut is ALWAYS a slut.  

Sorry, what does that mean?  Do you claim that a formerly-promiscuous woman is more likely to cheat on you?  It's fine to believe that, and I honestly make no arguments in either direction.  My thesis is simply that there is no reliable scientific evidence to back this assertion up."

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1388970862.0,"From the point of view of the rest of the world, and particularly NATO allies, the US did look crazy. At the time the UK, Italy and Turkey hosted US IRBMs (UK had the missiles under RAF control and the warheads under US control). I'm not sure why Turkey is the only country usually mentioned. The UK would be the primary target in a war, not the US. At the time there were few ICBMs, so the USA and USSR were out of reach of immediate long range attack by each other. However the IRBMs and bomber bases (V-force and SAC) meant that the USSR would have to attack the European NATO representatives immediately to defend itself.

With this context, you can see that Kennedy was trying to avoid exposing the USA to the risk that every other participant faced on a daily basis. It was particularly pointless as submarine technology meant that SLBMs would quickly erode the advantage of distance in any case. For this very short term advantage, Kennedy was prepared to risk nuclear war, with the primary risk being taken by the NATO allies."

Honestly? Even at its most dysfunctional, America is a better option than any other place on earth. There's still a lot of opportunity here. Hell, look how many immigrants come to Detroit of all places to stake some claim to a piece of the American dream. Look at the Koreans in LA after the 1992 riots.

Truth be told, white people left to their own device produce terrible culture. For better or worse, the racial dynamic of America makes all of us, including white people, different from the rest of the world.

&gt;If by that you mean that people like to equivocate faith with a great many different concepts, then you would be right, but it renders everyone at least as confused as I am.

&gt;My dictionary defines it as ""A feeling, conviction, or belief that something is true or real, not contingent upon reason or justification"". This is very much not applicable to the system of knowledge in which it is considered possible to know if gods exist.

In epistemology, knowledge is classified as a ""justified, **true** belief"". The **belief** that it is possible to know whether God/s exist or not is *not* a belief containing a necessary or contingent truth, so it is not knowledge, it is a belief. Formalizing this belief into words **does not** magically turn it into a ""system of knowledge"". "

That said, it's really up to you. If you have the time, I personally recommend learning the kanji, hiragana and katakana all out of context up front. 

I recommended RTK over Kanjidamage because learning the readings (pronuniciations) is difficult out of context - all RTK does is teach you stroke order and a single keyword for the kanji, which is extremely helpful later on. This speeds up the process a lot, making learning anywhere from 30 to 100+ a day simple depending on how much time you have.

Edit: But obviously classes aren't *useless*, I think I have to clarify that. They're great for practice, it's just that if you really want to learn the language you should try and study ahead."

sheilaleann,AskWomen,1388971047.0,"Hi there. I am 23 years old and six months ago I had a breast augmentation and lift (with the lollipop shaped scar). I decided to go under the knife after experiencing dramatic changes in my breasts after weight loss (65+ lbs). I went from a 38DD to 34B. They looked like floppy pancakes due to the excess skin. After working so hard at improving my body, I hated that my breasts were one area I couldn't work out and improve.

I am very happy with the results. The scars aren't that noticeable and, since I had a decent amount of breast tissue originally, I think they feel natural. I do not have any regrets, personally. 

Something to consider is that the implants will need to be replaced every 10 years or so. It really is more than a one time investment. Also, your breasts will likely change when you have kids (if you have any). Continue to research and look into others experiences and I am sure you will make the best decision for you. :) good luck!

VoxMeretricis,AskReddit,1388971070.0,"First of all:

&gt;I also have bipolar disorder II and anxiety but those don't really affect my physical health.

Yes, they probably do. Not in any direct way, but in lots of subtle ways. If nothing else, your body is going to respond to any stress your mind is under. The connection between your body's health and your mind's health is surprisingly important. Make sure you're taking care of yourself mentally, whatever that means - meds, therapy, mindfulness, meditation, whatever. 

Second, I can't stress this enough - get enough sleep but not too much. Find out how much sleep your body needs to function optimally, and get that amount: no more, no less. Second, stick to a sleep pattern. Get your body into a cycle that works for you and be strict with yourself about following it whenever possible.

Third: exercise is crucial. This doesn't have to be a hardcore gym visit, but make sure you're moving for an hour every day. You may find this helps your anxiety - it does for many. This can be anything - a long walk, swimming, going to the gym, whatever you find works best for you.

Finally: watch your diet. Eat mindfully. Don't deny yourself too much and don't indulge yourself too much. 

What works for me is this: I go to bed fairly early - usually 11 at the latest - and feel best sleeping until around 8:30. I tend to have a healthy breakfast and lunch, aiming for smaller portions and focusing on stuff I know is good for me, and eat whatever I want and however much I want for dinner. Usually have a snack or dessert in there somewhere. I take a probiotic and a general multi-vitamin before bed. I go to yoga 4-5 times a week - I find that personally, I need the structure of a class to keep up with exercise, since I'm lazy and wouldn't go to the gym. Yoga also helps me stay mentally balanced and calm, and provides a little bit of quiet meditation time, so I'm getting my exercise and my mental focus at the same time. 

Try experimenting and seeing what works during one of your healthy periods, and hopefully it will forestall getting sick. "

It's a noble idea, but there will always be a sufficiently power-hungry person willing to jump through as many hoops as you set up.

There's a reason that so many Asian/Eastern institutions are colloquially legendary for lengthy, obtuse, demeaning and seemingly pointless ""initiation"" and apprencticeships (think of the standard Buddhist Monk type stories).  Not only does this build character but it also frustrates those who are there for the wrong reasons.

Why start a conversation with someone who thinks you are altogether a different person because you lied about stuff in your profile? How's that going to work? I mean if you said you're 6'2 and you're 6' well that's not a huge deal (in my case actually it would be because I'm 5'1 and I feel like a child next to a 6'2 person, but hopefully you get what I mean). But lying about the kind of job you have is kind of big, I think.

I mean sure, if OP is not looking for something serious then he doesn't care. But if the person on the other end has different expectations then it's just wasting their time. I mean, I could theoretically build a profile where I am every man's dream apart from some little flaws to make it more realistic, but they would find out later on what was fake.

To the regional stuff - every of the 9 states has it's own dialect. If you stand beside someone who isn't from your state, you'll know it, even if the person talks standard German. Sometimes people even know the district I'm from even I'm not talking dialect.

I was raised 15km away from Vienna in Lower Austria, so there isn't such a big difference between the dialects, except some words. People tend to say that the Viennese dialect sounds the most ""low class"", but I would also say it's the most understandable, because if tv shows feature dialect, it's mostly Viennese.

I think it's a because it's a guy telling a woman ""hey I know you want it"" and encouraging her to be sexual because he gets her, he can see she's an ""animal"". 

But to me, it's reminiscent of a number of fairly uncomfortable encounters I've had with dudes, particularly when I was younger. I remember being at a bar kissing a guy from school and him trying to shove his hands down my skirt. I kept saying no and he kept saying ""I know you want it"". I had a fair few experiences like that: not horribly traumatising but deeply uncomfortable and a little invasive. 

It kind of reminds me of [that /r/changemyview post the other day](http://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1u9994/starting_to_think_the_red_pill_philosophy_will/) when a young man pulled a girl onto his lap after she indicated she wasn't interested. I think some women (and perhaps men) don't like this song because it kind of captures that vibe, of someone claiming they know what you want, perhaps better than you do yourself.

And I think the video doesn't help. To me, it's uncomfortable viewing. First off, there's the shot of Robin Thicke pulling a girl’s ponytail with his fist whilst singing about “blurred lines”. But in particular, there’s something about how vacant the models are, [bouncing up and down like dim-witted children](http://imgur.com/CauAhnx), all wide-eyed and open mouthed like Betty Boop come to life, whilst the men look serious and important in their suits, [literally counting wads of money](http://imgur.com/g5rVe5q). There's a dynamic in which the men are powerful and the women in infantalised, it's not consistent with powerful, sexual women, in my mind.

So I don't think the video advocates rape. But I think that it does reinforce a view of how men perceive women's sexuality that can make some women a bit uncomfortable. I'd encourage straight men to think how they'd feel if they were out at a bar and a guy pulls their hair and whispers into their ear ""I know you want it"", or ""gonna tear your ass in two"". It's icky."

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1388971338.0,"20% down won't work. Most lenders look for at least 75% LTV at 4 or fewer properties, and 70 or 65% after that. They also generally want a tenant in there (or at least an executed lease), which makes conventional lending a poor avenue for acquisition (you will be very hard pressed to find a deal on habitable properties in Austin). 

OTOH some portfolio lenders will do 80-85% at a reasonable interest rate based upon your credit score, assets, experience, and relationship with the bank.  Still doesn't solve acquisition. Cash or hard money are generally your options unless you have access to investors/private money. Hard money is still 65 or 70% LTV, and that is after including repairs. 

Your above thoughts on acquiring distressed and rehabbing are pretty much the only way to do low out of pocket deals right now. Austin is a brutal market for novice investors right now, so make sure to do your homework. 

Hope this helps.

That's it. Done. You're out the door. With needles, there's the whole sterilization thing to go through and the bandages, plus your arm hurts just enough to be annoying for a couple hours.

Alright, if they both look like that I wouldn't advise twisting it enough to adjust brace as much as you need, and you won't be able to put a timber hitch in it either. You're going to have to measure the bow down the belly (the side facing the archer when they use it) from knock to knock, and then order a string four inches shorter than that measurement. [Personally, I like Flemish twist.](http://www.3riversarchery.com/B-50+Flemish+Twist+Bow+String_i1515X_baseitem.html) I was pretty off on my guesstimate of how much a string goes for these days, though thirteen dollars is pretty cheap for finding out if you have a usable bow or not if you ask me.

If the bow is too heavy for you at proper brace you'll have to buy a lighter bow. I always suggest the Samic Sage for its magically cheap quality and replaceable limbs, but someone else could probably offer more options."

Bjorn_Bear,AskMen,1388971587.0,"I can totally relate to what you're going through man. About 4 years ago, my Dad and Mum divorced. Both of them had been seeing other people behind each others backs and pursued those relationships right after they were separated. Every relationship that starts like that is a shit house, because of how it started. 

Specifically, my Dad's girlfriend was super dysfunctional and really selfish. He would go two hours out of town to go visit her often. He would bring her back and she would be really fucking frustrating at our Dinner Conversations. She even got into an argument with my older brother, telling him to appreciate my Dad more. (My Brother is quite possibly the most docile and quiet person when it comes to conflict, so I was confused).

So many people like Dr. Phil and Oprah and all of them, along with just the general population (normal people at least), understand the rule of being a Step-Mum through a divorce. Unless that child is like, 4 to 6, you CANNOT put yourself in the problems. You are not a Mother, you can't tell them what to do. Too many people make the mistake and think that because their SO has kids, they have a right to ""protect them"" from their kids. It's stupid and selfish. Just like this lady with your Dad is being, she's fucking retarded. It's not her right to say shit about YOUR family.

It was hard for me to talk to my Dad, you're totally right about how they act. They're smitten with their girlfriends and won't listen to reason. I tried a few times to tell him he was being selfish and not listening to us, but rather someone who he had only known for a few years.

I know it's hard and I know it sucks. But this is your Dad's mistake to make. It's going to damage his relationship with you and any other family members involved. I'm beyond sorry this is happening to you and I hope he see's reason. But this isn't your responsibility. It's on his ass to fix it, not yours. "

Vmoney1337,GrandTheftAutoV,1388971600.0,"1: How much time do you spend on /r/GrandTheftAutoV[1] ?

Every day for around 30 minutes, going through top posts

2: Do you moderate any other subreddits? If yes, what are they?

I did CSS for:

/r/GTAOnlineCrews (Hey /u/Lilday!)

/r/notfoolinganybody

/r/InvisibleBicycles

/r/gonewildsmiles

/r/changingrooms

And most importantly /r/Gabe

3: Do you object to anything about the way /r/GrandTheftAutoV[2] works or is being run currently? What would you change if you could?

Not really, it would be awesome if people would stop posting modded cars and put them in /r/gtavcustoms instead.

4: What would you consider a bannable offense?

Constant shitposting, harassing others, OFFERING HACKS, spamming.

5: Why do you think the rules in the sidebar are important? Do you think there should be exceptions for special circumstances?

These rules are perfect and important right now, but could be added on to.

Absolutely being active in the subreddit and knowing what you're talking about.

10: Why should we choose you to moderate /r/GrandTheftAutoV[3] ?

I've been here since the announcement of GTA V, back when it had only a few thousand people. I love this sub but ever since it was advertised in /r/gaming it's sorta gotten a lot worse. I can guarantee i'll be here everyday helping out. 

11: Why do you want to be a moderator of /r/GrandTheftAutoV[4] ?

I wanna play a role in the community and be active too, since this is one of my absolute favorite subreddits."

Try to tag team eachother. If your fuse is getting short, ask your wife to take over and vice versa. No ""but I just had the baby for a whole day"" 5 minutes to get a break can do wonders. Try to remmeber that the baby doesnt understand and that your anger is felt by the baby which will only make things worse.

if your alone, put the baby in a safe place...strapped in the swing, in the crib...and walk away for a minute or 2. Step outside right out the door. Go to the bathroom and splash water on your face. Being a parent is the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. It tests EVERY nerve you have and the amount of patience. Even if you thought you were a calm and collected person, kids throw every theory out the window. Just hug that baby and hold him/her close. They will feel your love.

What i do value though is people who put forward logical and rational well reasoned responses or views that give me new information or insight to change my mind (something that does affect me), something you clearly are incapable of doing, so i get my jollies in pointing out how clearly incapable and stupid your approach is, and has no value to anyone.

kiwirish,losangeleskings,1388971888.0,"Okay, so the NHL has some complicated things involved in contract negotiations which are to do with the CBA between the owners and the players. One of these things is called waivers, where dependent on the amount of NHL experience, you may or may not be sent down to the minors and called back up endlessly.

If you are not waiver eligible, like Jones, you can be sent down and called up as often as your team wishes, however if you are waiver eligible, like Scrivens, if your team tries sending you down, you must pass through waivers.

Then you hop on the waiver wire, where every team's GM has a shot at you, from worst in the league to best in the league (in that order) for 24 hours to take your contract and keep you in their NHL roster. If you are taken, you go and your team gets no compensation (should you be a RFA you get compensation in draft picks through free agency), if you are not, you may be sent down to the minors this time, but next time you get sent down you must clear waivers again.

Now Scrivens and Jones are both good, young goalies, and we're not in a terrible situation with either goalie on our roster. Scrivens would be taken quickly and we lose a bargaining chip. Jones would not be subject to waivers because he isn't eligible and will get more experience starting in the AHL rather than sitting on an NHL bench.

Scrivens is a UFA soon, which means that his contract is up and will go to free agency, and with recent form he'll demand too much money for us to keep him, meaning Jones will be back next year as a backup anyway. While we have Scrivens we should try use him as tradebait like we did with Bernier last year and get something for Scrivens (draft picks, prospects or lower level NHLers), rather than lose him for nothing in the waiver system.

Also, should Scrivens go to waivers and not pass, we have a farm system to look out for. If Scrivens gets taken in waivers, then our NHL backup is gone, so our AHL starter (Jones) gets called up. Then we need to take our AHL backup and promote him to starter,  hurting Manchester, and then we need to hurt our ECHL team by taking their starter to back up Manchester (not too sure on how ECHL players interact with AHL players tbh), leaving Ontario with a backup at starter and having to give a new guy a contract to backup the ECHL.

TL;DR: Waivers are hard."

If you have made poor housing decisions in the past, and have been unable to resolve them, this does not bode well for your ability to perform as an investor. REI is as much about relationships and creative problem solving as it is about numbers and hard work. Have you tried small local banks? I bet many of them would refi you without PMI if you were to e. g. Buy a $10k savings bond with them or somesuch. Financing RE deals is hard, and being stranded in hard money and having your balloon come due after 6 months because you can't get creative on the backend could bankrupt you.

LionelOu,AskHistorians,1388972114.0,"The worst place to be accused of witchcraft was undoubtedly in the Holy Roman Empire. Not only did they have the overwhelmingly most trials, roughly 50,000, they also had the most executions, roughly  25,000-30,000.

In most of the rest of Europe, the conviction rate was around 1/4 to 1/3. For example France had around 3000 trials which led to around 1000 executions. Southern Europe (Italy, Spain, and Portugal) had around 10,000 trials with 1,000 exections, making them the least likely to execute someone for witchcraft. 

One reason for this large disparage in convictions is that in Italy, Spain, and Portugal the national inquisitions (for the most part) held sway over witchcraft trials. After a relatively short period trials of witchcraft were not done since most inquisitors refused to believe in magic.

In many other places, such as England, France, and Scandinavia the local courts tried their best to avoid witchcraft trials. However, in many cases they could not stand down when the local people was gripped by the ""witch fever"" and had to take on cases. Many did try to avoid executions if possible. Usually if the court did not allow torture on accused or witnesses it led to much fewer convictions.

Eastern Europe hasn't been as thoroughly researched yet, however it seems most areas had low conviction rates and few trials, around 7,000 trials in total with 2,000 executions. 

There's a few possible reasons for the HRE being so high in both trials and executions. For example, it produced anti-witchcraft material, such as the Malleus Maleficarum which was published there in 1487. Another is that the HRE was heavily fractured into small duchies, princedoms etc and its Reichskammergericht did not have jurisdiction in criminal cases. Every local court had to handle the trials themselves, with no overall planning. 

Overall, the number of trials are estimated at 80,000 with roughly 35,000 executions. Most of these trials took place during mid 16th century to mid 17th century. In the northern and eastern periphery the main period was in the latter half of the 17th century. By early to mid 18th century the witchcraft trials had mostly disappeared, with only a handful happening anywhere. 

Before this time period there were almost no trials, since the church openly claimed that magic did not exist and if anyone believed it did, they ""had been seduced by the Devil in dreams and visions into old pagan errors"" (stated in the canon Episcopi). Many other areas had laws expressing similar ideas. It wasn't until the 14th or 15th century that witchcraft and magic in these senses became believed in Europe.

The issue is that it's a distinction without a difference, and when it comes down to it you can either be unsuccessful without trying or you can just go for it and have fun with the attempt along the way whether you succeed or not. In my experience the thing you think you want is not necessarily what you think it is. I started my university career thinking I wanted to be a chemist and to do awesome lab work for my life, but along the way I found out I'd rather be outside and doing something a bit more hands on. So I switched my major to geology since I knew I still wanted to do sciences and just landed my first real career step in the middle of nowhere, but hey it's a start and who knows where my life will go from here. The point is that you can either do nothing and hate yourself for it, or just do something and accept that you may end up doing something else later, it's not a bad thing to experiment with what you want to do.

As for the part about the ladies, we all feel roughly the same way. That's kind of what it's all about. Being nervous is pretty damn common, but it gets easier with practice, like anything. Another thing I'd point out is that ~~women~~ people respond more positively to someone who actually seems to care about something. My guess is that if you start working towards a personal goal, you'll notice a social improvement as well.

The only other options is to never try and wind up with nothing anyway."

Borror0,Economics,1388972388.0,"The point that I'm making is that the minimum wage is a price solution to an income problem. There is nothing wrong with wages. There is no market failure driving them to be lower than they ought to be. The market is doing its job just fine. The issue is that we are not satisfied with the total income these workers have, at the end of the year. As a result, the most efficient solution is to supplement these people's income. 

A properly designed negative income tax (which is what direct transfers are, in the end) would be distributed throughout the year, the same way the government collects payroll taxes at the moment. 

&gt; Do you honestly think that people are out there not bothering to get a job because jumping through the hoops of welfare is more rewarding? And that getting a bigger tax credit will convince them otherwise?

In Quebec, for example, welfare recipients are only allowed to earn $200/month through work. If they exceed that, the equivalent sum is automatically deducted from their $604/month welfare check. The next $604/month are basically volunteering: they could earn as much by staying home and watching TV. Needless to say, staying at home *is* more appealing than working for no additional income. 

If the welfare recipient got to a certain percentage of that additional earned income deducted from his welfare check, instead of the entirety of it, it would make work more appealing. 

When welfare is designed in a way that encourage people on welfare to stay on welfare, by making work much more unappealing unless one is offered a *great* job, there's what economists call a welfare trap. Reforming poverty solutions to avoid welfare traps is, obviously, inherently desirable. "

I got a bad outbreak of spirogyra, and tried for a long time to manually remove as much as i could each day thinking eventually i could get ahead of it. No luck, it stuck around, it likes all the things your plant likes, so increasing co2, ferts, didnt help, blackouts dont kill it. Im against using chemicals for the most part, but since my tank had no shrimp in it, i tried it out. It killed all the spirogyra in 2 days, didnt kill any clado or any other algae.

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1388972422.0,"You could try /r/AcademicBiblical, but be prepared for a lot of Minimalist views (i.e. the view that everything was invented in Babylon for unspecified reasons). It's an area of history which is a little less rigourous than most, with a fashion for Minimalism at the moment. I won't claim to be any better myself.

Assuming for the moment that David existed, you probably realise that even the Biblical account showing the ""power hungry guy"" has been cleaned up a bit - for instance the way in which David is distanced from Joab's actions (other than in the case of Uriah). Also some different stories about David have been jammed together with inconsistencies ignored - for instance David appears to meet Saul for the first time twice. 

Ok, but as you say, the Biblical account does not show a very nice guy. So why is he important? Well he represented the high point of Israel. He had unified both kingdoms and established a first central administration. From there on it was downhill. Solomon over-spent and had to pay off his debts by ceding about 30 villages and their territory. After Solomon, the kingdoms split again. So David's time represented a peak of Israelite control - whether or not you believe that he actually existed."

Having said that, I and my entire family hunt. Some folks just aren't into it, and if that's the case, that's fine; nobody is left out, but nobody is forced. 

I guess that it comes down to decent parenting vs living your ego through your child. It's just the potential of physical harm that's added to rotten parents that's the problem. :(

Not to mention, what happens to poor people who work in places like Katy? They can't live close to where they work because it's too prohibitively expensive for them, and they can't buy a car to commute there because that's prohibitively expensive too. So they end up taking extra shifts and additional jobs just to afford living and working in a world built for more wealthy people.

As I alluded to in [my other comment,](http://www.reddit.com/r/houston/comments/1uf83u/widest_freeway_on_earth_katy_freeway_houston_tx/cehzb4r?context=3) public transit benefits more than poor people. It benefits teenagers who aren't yet old enough to drive cars. It benefits the middle class by giving them extra transportation options so that they can use their money more wisely (say, have only one car for the whole family instead of one for each family member). I would have loved to have grown up in Katy if it had a good bus system."

Sweet, sweet irony.

Tip 1: Female victim.

Tip 2: Female victim.

Tip 3: Female victim.

Tip 4: Female victim.

Tip 5: Female victim.

Tip 6: Unspecified gender victim.

Tip 7: Unspecified gender victim.

Tip 8: Unspecified gender victim.

Tip 9: Female victim.

Tip 10: Unspecified gender victim.

Only 6 of the 10 tips specified that the victim was a woman, so the poster does not use ""woman"" in every instance of being raped. Who's the one who didn't read again?

Also, the reason why you don't see posters like this directed at female rapists is because rape culture only exists for men. When a woman rapes a man, there isn't an entire culture backing her up and telling her ""he wanted it"" or making jokes about it like it's no big deal. Learn what rape culture is, and then you'll know why a man raping a women is so much worse than a woman raping a man."

jubbergun,TumblrInAction,1388972697.0,"&gt; No one who is truly concerned with the rights of the individual would try to force their own religious views on everyone else. 

Yet that's exactly what you're doing when you force someone to pay to support practices they find morally repugnant.

&gt; And if I am prohibited from doing something because of the religious views of some politician how is that supporting the goal of rights for the individual?

We're not talking about anyone being prohibited from doing something.  We're talking about people being forced into a system that by its very nature violates their moral, ethical, and/or religious beliefs.  I am no fan of prohibiting behavior for religious reasons, but neither am I for coercing people into behaviors regardless of their beliefs.

&gt; True enough, but that doesn't change the core of my actual point which is that, no matter where those beliefs come from - be it your religion of choice or simply a personal philosophy - you shouldn't be able to force them on others.

To be fair, those religious people aren't asking that it be mandated that you attend a church service or a mass once a week.  You (at least hypothetically) are mandating that they take actions that violate their conscious/free will.  In this case, those who share your view are the ones forcing an action on others.

&gt; How is that related to this issue?

It's an illustration of why we don't always go in ""the right direction,"" as you put it.  I'm not in the habit of telling people in other countries how they should be running their business, which is a habit I wish more of my countrymen shared.

Probably a little of both?

However, you need to direct these feelings elsewhere. It sounds like this is going to be very distressing for her, and having an upset boyfriend won't help at all. It may take a few days, but wait until you've fully stomached the situation and have calmed down before bringing it up. You really need to make sure your feelings are in check when you talk to her. 

You should tell her though. Not telling her isn't going to make the pictures magically disappear. It might be hard to hear but I think most people would rather know than not know. Unless you don't think this is true for her, tell her. "

gonefishn,WritingPrompts,1388972864.0,"Each step, he takes carefully and slowly, each movement, he makes with purpose and gravity as though the world were watching, wordless and drawn, waiting for for his next move. It isn’t a far walk to the parking lot, but he stretches this moment, hopelessly trying to grasp the flying seconds and minutes from passing away. He checks his pockets once, and once more out of habit, his wallet in his right and keys, phone on the left. The cold air embraces each of his fingers until he seems to wear the night like a pair of familiar gloves, thick and callous. When he gets to the car, he eases in, closes the door, and sits in silence.

A few minutes pass and he starts the car, flicks on the headlights, and pulls out onto the road. The radio is soft and tells him that this is his song, and his only; there is no one else but him and he nods slightly in agreement. Soon, he comes to a stop outside of an apartment building and he waits patiently, eyes forward, hands . A door slams and he hears the click of heels on the pavement. A gust of cold air rushes in as the girl enters hesitantly through the passenger side. He turns his head to glance at her, his eyes probing and studying her from the feet up. Simple white dress, black leggings, a small purse, and jet black heels. Her hair is worn straight down to her shoulders, and her makeup is lightly done. Clients prefer a bit of a more natural look, he had told her once. She looks at him nervously, and he meets her eyes, holds them, and then turns away without a word as they drive away.

The ride for the most part is quiet, and at moments, she can’t help but shudder. She’s not sure how things got to this point. She can’t remember how he used to smile, like he was always holding a secret and daring her to find out. She can’t remember the fight with her parents, the things that drove her into his arms, the promises he made. She can only remember the bills piling up, the way he grew more and more silent, and his smiles slowly becoming cold smirks.

""Why are you here?"" she asks herself wearily. Leave, she tells herself, you should leave. But she knows she won’t. She’ll always hope that he’s still the same boy who caught her reading Faulkner by the window, the boy who told her stories of a world she never knew, the boy who would slowly trace the letters of her name into the palm of her hand with his thumb as their fingers would intertwine. She shudders again.

“Babe, it’s cold. Can you turn on the heat, please?”

He ignores her, and she retreats back into the seat, trying to feel every fiber of the cushion for warmth.

“Do you remember what I told you?”

She jumps at the question. He doesn’t turn towards her, but he repeats the question. “I said do you remember what I told you?”

She says, “Yes.” It was only her third time doing this, and the last two clients had been easy enough, but he was always careful, always double checking to make sure she wouldn’t make a mistake.

He says, “Good,” and then asks, “Do you love me?”

She doesn’t hesitate to answer, “Of course, I love -”

He slaps her, and she can feel the tears forming in her eyes, but she knows she has no more tears left. She bites her lip and looks down, clutching her purse like a wounded child.

“No, you don’t love me,” he says with an edge of annoyance in his voice. “Tonight, you love someone else. And you’ll make sure they feel that way. Do you understand me?”

She nods.

“I said do you understand me?”

“Yes.”

“Good. Now check the mirror. I don’t want them to see a bruise on your face.”

She knows, of course, she wouldn’t have one. He always thought before he acted, everything he did was deliberate. But she knows not to argue so she checked anyway, making note of the already fading reddish area where his cold hand had struck her cheek.

They drive in silence the rest of the way, the radio playing a song that she could barely hear, a song that was unfamiliar and foreign. Finally, the car pulls over at a modestly sized home in the suburbs. He turns off the engine, and looks her over one last time, his gaze cold and calculating.

“Okay, go.”

Without a word, she opens the door and gets up. He grabs her arm and motions to her purse.

“Hey, do you want to leave that here?”

She shakes her head. “No, it’s okay.” He shrugs and she leaves the car and into the night.

She quickly walks up to the front door and rings it. A few seconds later, a middle aged man opens the door and she steps inside. The door closes.

Back in the car, the boy rolls down the windows and lights a cigarette. He draws deeply and exhales slowly, trying to keep the cloud of smoke close to him as it starts to drift away.  He wonders if the man will try to touch her. Kiss her. Take her clothes off. He wonders if she’d let him. If she’d enjoy it. He clenches his fist. He’s annoyed by the thought, even though he knows it wouldn’t happen. This wasn’t prostitution. No, in this world, people weren’t looking for sexual pleasures. They had things for that. Machines, whorehouses, drugs. No, what people wanted were the intangibles, the stuff you couldn’t really buy, at least, not until now. They wanted connections, someone to listen to, to care for them, to love them without having to worry about the risks. People craved these things, and he provided them. For a price.

An hour later, the front door opens and the girl steps out. She quickly enters the car, shivering from the cold. The boy starts the engine and drives off. After a moment, he turns on the heat.

“So what did you do for him?” he asks.

She sits quietly and for a moment, she believes that he still cares.

“Oh, you know. The usual,” she replies as she hands him the money.

There was actually no such thing as the usual since she had only seen two other clients before, but she had heard stories from others. Most of time, people seemed content to just talk. Some wanted to hold you, others wanted to be held. Sometimes, they wanted to play music for you. And a daring few asked for kisses, but on the condition that they were meaningful and not empty. The first person she saw wanted to lie side by side in the bed, almost touching, but not quite. He wanted to match their breathing together and when they were in sync, he asked her to tell him things about herself. Then it was over, and he gave her the money and thanked her.

He simply nods and says, “That’s nice.”

She wonders if he’ll take her back to his place, and she tries to remember the last time she had been allowed to sleep over. But as the roads grow more familiar, she realizes that he is taking her back to her apartment and her heart grows heavier and heavier until they reach her street. He stops the car, and nods to her. She opens the door, steps out, and looks back at him before she closes the door.

“I still love you,” she says desperately.

He smiles sadly. “I know.”

She closes the door, and she watches the boy drive off and disappear down the street and around the corner. Her heels click and clack and she makes her way to the front door, up the stairs, and into her apartment. She rubs her shoulders and sits quietly on the couch. She reaches for her purse, takes out the gun, and unloads it.

The boy soon finds himself back to the same parking lot he started from. He turns off the engine, gets out, and locks the doors. He makes his way to the building, enters the code, and takes the elevator up. The door is unlocked so he opens the door and makes his way to the bedroom where he finds a girl waiting.

She says, “You’re late.”

He puts the money on the table, gets on the bed, pulls the girl close, and says, “I want you to tell me that you love me. I want you to make me believe it.”

And he strokes her cheek, carefully and slowly, each movement, he makes with purpose and gravity as she watches, wordless and drawn, waiting for his next move."

Srace,OrthodoxChristianity,1388972942.0,"The ""continuing"" Anglican churches, including the Anglican Church in America, that have broken away from the US Episcopal Church and/or the Anglican Church of Canada are not part of the Anglican Communion.

During the Reformation, the Church of England was pretty careful to retain the apostolic succession (continuous line of ordination of bishops) when it split away from the Roman Catholic Church.  This is also true for the Roman Catholic sacraments, which were retained.  

The Anglican church was never supposed to be a ""new"" church; instead, it was intended as a state church that would discard the worst excesses of Roman Catholicism and accommodate England's Puritan faction.  Because of this, the church retained the basic elements that had been part of Christianity from the early days, e.g. the liturgy, hierarchical church structure, and other tradition-based elements.  Unfortunately, as other comments have pointed out, a number of weird things have occurred in the church over the past 40 years, and there are no longer any guarantees about what you will find when you attend an Anglican/Episcopal service.

Although the Orthodox churches are not in communion with the Church of England, since the 1920s, there have actually been a number of ""official"" discussions on the positions of the two churches with a view to possible reunification, or at least theological consensus (for a detailed outline, see this pdf:  http://www.churchofengland.org/media/39231/gs1706.rtf).

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1388973009.0,"&gt;Serious question, what is the point in doing that?

Online dating is a meat market for women. Men don't stand a chance unless you're an apex/alpha male, and in that case, you probably already get laid in real life anyways and just online dating to get even more passively. 

Lying about your ""qualifications"" is an attempt to rebalance the scale tipped towards extreme shallowness by women online. When you get 20 messages a day from men, why would you **not** demand all men be 14ft tall and have a yearly salary of $100000000000000000000000000?

&gt;Not being able to believe in anything said by a stranger online is the reason why I've never brought myself to trying online dating.

Nothing anyone says about themselves in person is particularly accurate either. 

&gt;Why start a conversation with someone who thinks you are altogether a different person because you lied about stuff in your profile?

Because the only other option is A) to sit in your house and masterbate, B) die a virgin, and C) actually become that much better person which takes years (or isn't possible at all).  

Men are not like women. We can't leave our houses and be bombarded with sex. Sex is a resource that takes time, effort, and skill to acquire. Think about how it feel to have to hunt and anima for every piece of food you ate. That's what sex is to men.

&gt;How's that going to work?

Be leveridging dishonesty with attraction. 

&gt;I mean sure, if OP is not looking for something serious than he doesn't care. But if the person on the other send has different expectations then it's just wasting their time. I mean I could theoretically build a profile where I am every man's dream apart from some little flaws to make it more realistic, but they would find out later on what was fake. So please enlighten me, what are the advantages of this?

You can't because you're a woman. The only criteria men are judging you on is your display picture, and you can't lie about your display picture after he sees you from across the room when you finally meet. "

Like, legitimately. All this stuff is who you are, or more accurately, how you feel. A) We wouldn't be able to change that even if we wanted to, and B) feeling a particular way is not a bad thing in and of itself.

I will tell you that if you're not really invested in sex as a thing to do, that's fine, and it's good to know that about yourself, and you're in good company here. A big theme you'll hear around here a lot is ""Do things you like, don't do things you don't want to do (though wanting to do them for someone you care about is a valid reason to want to).""

You may be asexual! It sounds like maybe you're experiencing romantic attraction and not sexual, though only you can say that for sure. And yes, it's possible to be only romantically attracted to someone, or even have a romantic orientation that's counter to your sexual orientation (though that doesn't seem to be what's going on here; just putting it out there). 

Whatever you are, we'll be happy to help clear up any confusion that we can, and generally offer support and a place to help make sense of things."

We set out after class got out (3pm) and finished some time after dinner (7pm), right before our 2 hour mandatory study hall.  After completing it, a few of the guys decided to grab a cigarette inside (strictly prohibited on campus), while most of the guys headed back to the dorm.  I didn't smoke but decided to stick around to wait for them, I can't recall why, but I'm glad I did because after a few minutes, I hadn't heard anything from them and went to check on the smokers.  The entrance had collapsed and they ignored it to finish their cigarettes, not considering how much oxygen was left inside.  They had all fallen unconscious and I had to tear into the igloo and drag them out, one by one.  

I'm not sure if they would have died but no one would have noticed them missing for at least an hour (they would have been noticed missing at study hall) if I hadn't stuck around and I'm guessing that oxygen deprivation for that period would not have helped their little brains.

**+$60** for a year's membership to Xbox live, which is essentially paying for the privilege of using internet which you already pay for on a device that you already paid for.

**+$20 x 3** each time a DLC comes out. Usually three happen per year.

smootie,college,1388973350.0,"A lot of my friends are math tutors, and they tell me horror stories about other tutors giving students wrong information sometimes.

I've had a couple of horrible profs.  The worst was a guy who would, mid-way through a lecture, stop and talk about football and occasionally he would nod off.  He was in very poor health, so office hours were just as bad.  His TA, who did most of the teaching, did not speak English very well.  I can understand heavy accents really well, and even I couldn't make out what she was saying 90% of the time.

So, not all tutors are bad.  Some work really hard to help you learn the material.  But they are there to help you, not to give you the answers.  Ultimately, you're responsible for getting the help you need for the class, regardless of how bad your prof was (unless your prof was abusive or otherwise violated your school's policies).

Most professors, even adjuncts, will make time to help you even if they don't have explicit office hours posted.  You just have to email them and ask.

Other resources to try the next time you get stuck:

* friends who have taken the courses before

* grad students (bot don't bother them if they look busy)

* different tutors (my school has multiple tutoring centers)

* other profs in the same field, either prof you've had before or someone who specializes in that area

* online (reddit has multiple homework help subreddits, PhysicsForum and StackExchange are invaluable for STEM subjects)

In all my classes, we fill out an instructor evaluation at the end of the semester.  Make sure to give your instructor constructive criticism for how he/she can improve.  They actually do read those things!

4. I'm fond of collecting vintage patterns, and I'd like to put one or two of them on my website for others to use. Can I do this?
It depends on how vintage 'vintage' is. As we've seen, after a certain period of time, copyright in the pattern expires. Once copyright expires, the pattern enters into the public domain.

However, there are a number of wrinkles. Copyright may expire in one country before it expires in another, so the pattern may enter the public domain in one country, while remaining protected elsewhere. If you're thinking of putting those patterns on the Web, avoiding infringement in another country becomes a tricky affair. Furthermore, thanks to the accession of the United States to international treaties, works of non-U.S. authors that used to be in the public domain in the United States but protected elsewhere automatically regained U.S. copyright protection in 1996. 

You may be wondering whether the republication of an out-of-print pattern that might still be protected by copyright could escape infringement by being characterized as a 'fair use' or a 'fair dealing.' Keep on wondering. Although access to the original work is a factor which may be taken into consideration, the fact that a book is out of print is no guarantee that you won't be liable for copyright infringement. Not only that, but a finding of fair use or fair dealing can also be influenced by how much of the original work is taken. The more of the work that is copied, the less inclined a court might be to find the copying 'fair.' 

In short, there are only two ways to be certain whether you can reproduce a vintage pattern. The first is to get permission from the current legal copyright owner, if you can track him, her, or it down. If you can get permission, get it in writing, and file it for safekeeping. The second is to get confirmation [preferably, from the copyright owner or a qualified attorney] that the pattern has indeed passed into the public domain.


**so basically, if the OP has permission from the copyright holder or the patterns are traditional ones already available (ex. ""Grandma's Favorite Dishcloth"" pattern, already on ravelry) then she can put them up online."

CORNDOGCOMMANDO,AskReddit,1388973483.0,"the belief that women and girls are the kinder sex...no they are the coldest ruthless manipulative sex. i've never seen a man take such joy destroying a women he once loved as i've seen women destroy a man she once called her husband or boyfriend. 


from my own mother to my sister and female friends once they they turn on you there is no limit to what they will do to hurt you, from lies to violence by proxy she will do anything and everything with a smile. 


kinder sex my ass, as for how this lie shaped my life. as a child i was told women are by default good so if i need help go to them and they will help me, this was not true they refused to help if it was a female that was the culprit. they were like one big gang they would help as long as they were not helping you against one of their own. 

from teachers to nurses and social services everyone of those women were fine with all the wrongs that were being done to me because girls and women never lie or do evil.

if i had known that men at least would try and help i would have asked men for help but i was brainwashed to think women are naturally good and would help a boy or teen  if they needed help. 

now as an adult i see the truth, watch what you say and how you say it because if you piss off a women she wont think twice about hurting you in some way, seeing all my married friends from 10 years ago get decimated in divorce court for not keeping their wives 100% happy 100% of the time was truly heart breaking. seeing my friends get jailed on lies and kicked out of their own homes with no proof of abuse just on the word their girlfriends.

AnJu91,AskReddit,1388973505.0,"From Atheism to Agnosticism. 
 
I used to deeply despise and hate religion, and believed there could never ever be something 'supernatural'. Then after learning about the domain and boundaries of what is 'natural', I decided there is a twilight zone between the known natural and supernatural that definitely is uncertain yet, and that it would be nothing but arrogant if one would pretend to know anything certain about this twilight zone.
 
On top of this, after life progresses and you look, observe and ponder about the things you see, things beautiful and horrific, sad and lovely, I must admit that subconsciously I wish for something more and bigger than man, something benevolent and holy which stands above and outside the convoluted shit of the world.
 
These changed amongst others (like appreciating parts of religion as a phenomenon) caused me to lose my dogmas regarding spirituality and religion. 
 
I am agnostic because I am of opinion that spirituality is  natural to humans, because we in all reason cannot deny or confirm anything about the aforementioned twilight zone. I am agnostic because I do not deny the meaningfulness of an idea of god and religion, which stands parallel to many things familiar to us.
 
To me, when I think of what is holy or divine, I think of math as a god of order, the pinnacle of existence and causality. Within humankind a god was born at the first spark of consciousness, that dwells amongst us holistically as long as we will maintain this fire of consciousness.

This is going to sound very shitty, but it was a real observation that I made. During the 2nd or 3rd year at my Law School, students were encouraged to bid on employment interviews through the school's career services. I'm not going to go into exactly how it works, but students basically bid on which employers to interview with and then those employers invite students to first round interviews - with the University acting as the middle man. So, what I noticed was that the people expressing interest in the high paying firms were mostly tall guys with a few short guys sprinkled in. But, there were also organizations that were strictly *pro bono* clinics which provided legal aid to under served communities. These jobs paid nothing. A noble thing to do, but the crowd of people bidding for those positions were quite interesting. From what I saw, it was ALL pretty girls and short guys. No tall men. Not even any average height guys. And most of the girls bidding were highly attractive when compared to the average student. What was going on here?  Are short men just more generous and nurturing than tall guys?

Ostrololo,civ,1388973602.0,"You can't separate theme from a game's mechanic. Take *Magic: The Gathering*, for example. The most recent expansion is based on Greek mythology. Instead of just using it as a theme to flavor some new cards, they actually tried to design new mechanics to capture the feel and tone of mythology, like heroic self-accomplishment or a sense of wonder.

Mechanics should strive to imitate the *essence* of a game's theme, and Civ5 fails at that. To make it clear: you don't have to simulate the real world, but simply evoke some feeling associated with your theme. Having each player command three or so tall cities with large swaths of unclaimed wilderness in between doesn't reflect the feeling of building an empire.

Of course, the issue is that mechanics should also reward the player for doing what they want to do. Simply put, playing tall tends to be more fun for most people than playing wide, since you don't have dozens of cities and popups to manage. This isn't an issue specific to Civ5; in Civ4 it was a pain the ass to rule over large empires as well. The mismatch between what the game should be doing *thematically* and what it wants to do *mechanically* it's something they will have to fix for Civ6."

There will inevitably be questions like ""how do we know when we're done?"" and such, but those are things you get to answer for yourselves. (It would be remiss of me to not also mention cooperative masturbation as a possible recommendation for you two.)

I agree that demiromantic is what you're aimed at. I can speak from very personal experience that it is very possible to be asexual and still have a significant drive to get that sexual release, too. Is it kind of frustrating and sometimes feel a little distasteful and artificial? Sure. But sometimes when you get hungry Taco Bell is fine, and other times it's better to sit down with your partner and have a nice dinner out. I think I lost that metaphor halfway through but I hope you have some idea what I mean.

You already know this, I'm pretty sure, but the ability to climax does not make a man. The real strength of personality comes from adapting well to your situation and finding new joy in your unique circumstances.

Hope that helps! We'll be here if you ever need to vent or ask stuff or whathaveyou."

Secondly, most of the studies that DO focus on gender issues are almost always self reported, and completely unrealiable.

I am just one mod, so if the other mods felt strongly about it, I couldn't really do much but oppose, but yeah. The hidden score feature hasn't been touched since they introduced it and it's more annoying than anything right now.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1388973844.0,"No, the hormones in the pill will always override fertility (via preventing ovulation or embedding depending on your pill) as long as you are taking it correctly. The changes are simply in your tolerance to the hormones, which is what causes PMS symptoms and side effects. 

Side effects occur soon after taking the pill as your body reacts to the new artificial hormones, they may or may not settle down. Your natural hormones may rise and fall during your time on the pill, which is what may cause symptoms later in your pill-taking. But because the hormones in the pill are always at a consistent level, there efficiency as a contraception is also consistent. The body needs a very specific level of each hormone to be fertile the pill will always deny the body this specific level. meanwhile the body can experience side effects on almost any level of hormones, which is why its common to experience them at some point."

What about a million dollars? Would you prostitute yourself if someone had a gun to your head? Would you do [X immoral thing] if you had a gun to your head? 

Everything matters when it comes to the ultimate culpability a person has for things they have done, both their choices and their situations and histories. The world is complicated, and over-simplifications like, ""you always have a choice, even with a gun to your head,"" don't help anyone except those who don't have guns to their heads.

Kaisharga,asexuality,1388974124.0,"Fair enough.

As far as the stated central idea of this subreddit goes, the ""common"" definition of asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction. Consider whether you've seen someone and thought, ""wow, I *want* that."" That's the sort of feeling/thought that I've seen described as sexual attraction. Do you experience that? Is it sex-specific (as in, males only, females only, both)? Does it happen only sometimes, and seems to be mostly in the contexts of a close personal relationship? (That one we call demisexuality, for the record.)

Consider then your feelings of romantic, seeking-a-close-relationship attraction. It's not necessarily a sexual feeling, though for many people the two are entwined. Same questions: same gender, opposite, or both/all? Don't really feel it until you're really close?

And often glossed over but not insignificant is the libido issue. Do you ever think about having sex? Sometimes? All the time? Doesn't have to be focused on a person, just, does sex as a concept seem like something you want regularly, whether by masturbation or partnered or whathaveyou? We don't really have words for these ones, but they're good to know and understand.

Meditate upon those, and consider looking at the AVEN wiki and lexicon as linked on the sidebar. May help clear things up, may give you a sort of basis to start sorting things out and figuring out where you feel like you might belong. And whether that, in the end, matters! Because it might. Or it might not! Exclamation points!"

smootie,college,1388974222.0,"Well, first you should decide what you want out of college.  The reason doesn't have to be lofty or noble.  

* Some people are passionate about a field
* Some people go to college because they think they will make more money.  
* Some people go to college so that they don't have to go out into the ""real"" world.  
* Some go because their parents told them to.
* Some people do it because it's fun/challenging.

If you realize that you don't have a reason to be in college, then why invest the time and effort?

If you *know* it's something you want to do, but are still unsure, you can buy some time taking gen eds.

I changed my major several times.  Something that helped me decide was realizing that choosing a major doesn't mean I have to work in that field *forever*.  Almost everyone changes careers multiple times in their lifetimes.  So don't get pressured out when picking a major.

Also, if you haven't already, make friends with other people in your major.  Being able to bounce ideas around with people who have the same interests and being able to commiserate with them kept me engaged and excited about my major."

TokisCodpieceBZZZ,childfree,1388974669.0,"""These changes will adversely affect many families who cannot afford the cost of a holiday in school holidays.""  Then don't take one.  If the price really makes that much of a difference between can and can't afford, that means you're not saving toward the future - college fund, retirement fund, rainy day fund.  

Actually, I think parents should be free to take their kids on holiday whenever they want - and then the kid should be marked absent, and any work not done should be marked zero.  A family emergency or tragedy is a good reason for absence.  A vacation is not.

My favorite comment is this: ""i work in a school and if its ok for teaching staff to strike when they feel like it, whats wrong with parents taking there kids on hoilday.""  Oh yes, because striking due to getting severely underpaid for doing work that doesn't end when the school day does, is exactly the same as taking a vacation.  Yep."

Besides its protective function clothing may have become popular because it decorates the body, conveys status or identity, and de-sexualizes the body by covering reproductive organs. Women for example might feel safer if covered and less likely to provoke sexual urges in men.  It's sad that it has to be that way in our culture... but it is.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1388974696.0,"&gt;if a guy is hot and she perceives him less wealthy than her would she still choose him

In female logic hot is hot is hot. If she thinks he can deliver worthy sperm to sire worthy offspring, she'll bed the pool boy.

Remember that a portion of the concept of hypergamy is that women who can't bed Tom Brady will still try to put together a series of sexual partners that amount to Frankenstein monster version of Tom Brady. The dumb pool boy provides the sperm, the thug provdes the tingles, and then the Steve Buscemi looking banker pays the bills.

- - - 

Status is almost universally good, with maybe a few exceptions for weird forms of status that aren't really status at all like ""I'm a startup founder and our Kickstarter campaign is almost 25% funded after 40 weeks!""

Money . . . is trickier. And generally over-rated.

The thing with money is that it can purchase the trappings of success, but it is not success in its own right. Tom Brady gets better ass than Bill Gates, which is to say that a reasonably rich jock beats a ridiculously wealthy nerd.

You want money to just be a presence. It's just a thing. It's there. You don't want to hang your money out there, buying drinks left and right. You just want it to be an effortless thing.

Whatever you do, you cannot allow the girl to equate you to an available supply of money. Women know the difference between a successful guy who happens to have money and a guy who is trhowing around money in order to appear to be successful. And they will shit test you on the money thing. 

I'm a miserly fucker if there ever was one (hint: this is how you accumulate money without committing too many crimes). But when I go out I make sure to dress a little better than the venue. Left to my own devices, I'd prance out like a fuckin French king! (Not really, but I'd dress better than I do.) 

Every now and then I get a very interested chick who tests for Rich Guy Game. I've had women hint at the dumbest shit you can imagine in terms of ""you could buy me ______"". The thing is to laugh it off and absolutely do not pay for anything, even if it's for a blood tranfusion that could save her life. The funny thing is, women respect a rich guy who won't pay for jackshit more than the guy who is trying to buy friends. (See? Hypergamy isn't all bad!)

Money is dangerous in TRP terms because it can be a gateway to lazy workarounds and beta providership, and women will sniff you out in a heartbeat if you go there.

TLDR: women aren't that impressed with money."

For what it's worth, I really enjoyed Ouran, but then again, I'm a girl. It's a series that you can't take *too* seriously. It plays the stereotypical rom-com tropes straight and pokes fun at them at the same time. Sure, all the guys are rich, handsome, and charming in their own ways, but Haruhi calls them out on their ridiculousness numerous times with her sensible, yet blunt, nature.

Also, the ""gay"" feeling might also come from the fact that the majority of the first episode is spent with the Host Club thinking Haruhi is male. Afterwards, they treat her like a girl and the reverse harem feeling starts up."

I was never with anyone with a delayed ejaculation problem but I'd feel bad if I had to tap out before he was able to cum.


I have been with a guy who had depression related erectile issues. He'd go soft during or have a hard time getting it up. I would always assure him it was okay and we could try again later.

alettertoelise7,AskReddit,1388974930.0,"Several years ago, a friend died in a motorcycle accident. He was otherwise a healthy mid 30s and registered for organ donation.  We are at the hospital in a private room with him, along with friends and family. I walked into the hallway just as the person from CORE and someone from the hospital brings his mother out to discuss necessary paperwork and whatnot for the donation. 


At this point, she's obviously traumatized but enthusiastic about going through with this because this is what he wanted and he was such a charitable person in life. I'm overhearing all this and glad that she had a sound mind to follow through with his wishes. Then a family member comes out and proceeds to make a giant fuss about how disrespectful it would be to desecrate his body and how she's going to let them cut him into little pieces, down to peeling his skin off. 


The staff are trying to explain the process and how it is so helpful, that it saves lives, this was his wish, while the idiot family member is raising hell and making his poor mother sob uncontrollably and mumbling about hurting her child. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff and those of us with sense, she declined to donate. My level of disgust and rage was at an all-time high. 


Organ donation benefits so many people. I know that, unfortunately, it is also a big business, but for those who are waiting each day for a miracle, saying yes means so much. 


TL/DR: Ignorant family member goes into graphic detail about organ donation in order to traumatize mother and make her say no to CORE and hospital, despite deceased adult son's written wishes. "

She told me she loved me. We hung out sometimes. I kissed her once and thought about it for days. And then, out of nowhere... I guess she just couldn't keep it up. I texted her something innocuous, like ""hey! What's up?"" or some such, and she just replied ""no"". I asked her what that meant, no response. Well, whatever. Later, I tried again, and soon got a call from a *different* number. I didn't pick it up, but they left a message. It was like a five minute tirade from her friend telling me to fuck off, Emily only talked to me because she felt bad for me, just leave Emily alone because this friend was tired of me bugging her.

I sent a text to this friend saying she didn't know what she was talking about. At the same time, I texted Emily to ask Wtf was up with that. Her friend was the only one to respond, telling me she *did* know - that every time I told her I loved her, Emily showed her friends and they all had a good laugh at me, and that she told everyone that kissing me made her want to vomit. I never heard from her again. 

That shit *hurt*. I was fucked up for a solid year, and I *still* have occasional difficulty trusting anyone. It was awful. 

I mean, I was suicidal pretty much all the time back then. I had hung every good thing in my life on this person, and... That. I've never felt so profoundly betrayed.

My Sobek, for example, is maximized for per-shot damage with Multishot, Damage+, and Blast (Fire+Ice). Since the damage is devastating, I use it as a single-shot weapon, with one shot per enemy at close range, and stretches the use of the 20 round magazine to great effect, as opposed to an automatic-shotgun build.

The Hek is even moreso a damage-based shotgun, and maximizing its power will yield even better results. And the Strun is midrange in performance from the two but provides very good ""pump-action"" power for cheaper (in case you cannot afford to craft the Hek or Sobek due to Mastery or cost)."

Pretty much that. Maybe that would change if women were as naturally strong as men, but if it happened by a magic button-push it wouldn't happen overnight.

Short men are directed toward or are just plain left with the hobbies and activities that society considers less masculine such as these 'nerdy' recreational conventions.


Why try to attain CEO status when taller men will simply dominate you with body language in the board room?

Why try and pick up women in a bar when a taller guy will come along and simply say to the woman ""why don't you talk to a real man""?

Florida St. has scored an average of 50.7ppg this year, while Auburn has averaged 40.2ppg.

While [Florida St. has kept its opponents to an average of just 10.7ppg](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/52/florida-state-seminoles), they are weaker against the run than the pass. The most points Florida St. allowed this year was 34 against Boston College (who finished with a record of 7-6), and Boston College was the best rushing attack faced so far this season by the Seminoles (20th in the NCAA with 212.5ypg, and rushed for 200 yards against Florida St.). Auburn has the number one rushing attack in the country, averaging 335.7ypg on the ground.

Auburn, led by its running game, [has scored 30 or more all but once this year](http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/2/auburn-tigers). It scored 59 points in its most recent outing, against Missouri, which is the 34th in the nation in points against, averaging 23.1ppg allowed. Auburn also scored 34 against Alabama, the number 4 defense in the country based on points.

Florida St., meanwhile, has scored 37 or more points every week this season, and has scored 45 or more in 10 games. Auburn allows, on average, 24ppg, but has allowed much more than that against top opponents this year.

Given all that I'd guess a scoreline of something like 45-35, which is well above the over/under line."

Unfortunately, the google books version of that textbook doesn't have those pages available for free or else I would give you a direct citation.

The bit about women using more words than men may have come from a news article.

More useful is telling her that you have trouble reaching climax. Although if I'm reading your message right, she kinda already knows. Best to discuss it, though!

thisisjustmyusername,nfl,1388975462.0,"Really?! Tomlinson was a much more complete back and a legitimate threat in the passing game. I find it highly unlikely that Peterson will surpass Tomlinson's total TDs, let alone his rushing TDs. Adrian has a long way to go to challenge LT in yards from scrimmage as well. 

Not that Adrian isn't an all-time great, but the dude is not in the same ballpark as LT statistically as we speak. Taking into consideration the shelf-life of running backs in the NFL, I think it is extremely unlikely that a case can be made that Peterson is more deserving of first ballot consideration than LT. 

All-time Rushing Yards- LT 5th, Peterson 27th.

All-time all purpose yards- LT 7th, Peterson 82nd.

All-time rushing TDs- LT 2nd, Peterson 14th.

All-time total TDS- LT 3rd, Peterson doesn't crack the top 30. 

You might prefer Adrian's style of running, but he is not anywhere near as accomplished as LT is. "

And a character who died who should have lived:  The whole Deidera Sasuke fight was both cool and stupid.  He should not have killed himself just to kill someone who's face he didn't like.

However, someone has to build and maintain the structure for its use.  And if it is getting congested (just like traffic jams) they have to increase capacity, or the internet/roadway slows to a crawl.  

Paying as you go, or for a set amount can work.  (see toll roads and turnpikes compared to buying data as you go and a monthly cap).  On the other hand, paying a set amount for unlimited access works better in other cases (most home internet and almost all other roads that are maintained with tax money).

Depending on where phone internet usage goes, we may move slowly more towards unlimited with a monthly fee, just like home internet or taxes on roads.  But so long as major congestion can be reduced for those who pay a little extra, toll roads and per data use will also still exist.

Jebus, No shaving cream? Crazy.
First off, go get some GOOD shaving cream, the stuff with Aloe in it.

Also, exfoliate first before shaving, go pick up some of that apricot scrub, rub that in, wash away, then put on a good bit of shaving cream and shave away.

Afterwards, go grab some ""Bikini Zone"" its a cream to use post shaving (think, women's equivalent of after shave for dudes)

Also, once you start, keep it up, don't be a ""yo-yo"" shaver going back and forth, that'll cause problems too.

Also, use hot water on the razor blade and another tip, don't use these wussy woman razors, go grab yourself a Mach3 for men and use that, MUCH better results.

The biggest problem with glass/smooth cooktops (if I am informed correctly) is that the textured bottoms of some pots can cause hot spots that can crack the glass.  [The classic water bath pots](http://www.frugalupstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/IMG_4499.jpg) have a ridged bottom, so aren't safe to use.   [Presto canners](http://www.amazon.com/Presto-01781-23-Quart-Pressure-Canner/dp/B0000BYCFU) have flat bottoms, and the footprint fits most large burners on glass cooktops.  And as others have said, you don't want to drag the canner across the cook top.  Lift it all the way up so it is off before moving it laterally.  

Ps if you do have a Presto with a dial gauge, take off the one piece mushroom-looking weight and replace it with [a three piece weight](http://www.amazon.com/Presto-Pressure-Canner-Regulator/dp/B000HMBVQ8).  This way you won't have to rely on the dial gauge (which has to be recalibrated every year and might even be wrong right out of the box).

codayus,bdsm,1388975657.0,"Depends what you mean.  As far as kinky versions of Facebook go, it's mostly pretty good.  Certainly the best we have.

On the other hand, it has a dark side.  It's very clique-y, and culturally has a very lax attitude towards doxxing, harassment, and abuse, but an extremely aggressive attitude towards accusations, airing disputes, or anything that harks of ""drama"".  The results can be extremely bad.  Eg, if Person A says Person B did something bad at a real life event, Fetlife (in the person of the community and the caretakers) will come down like a ton of bricks on Person A until they delete everything, retract, and apologize.  If Person B is still pissed off at Person A after this, and starts a witchhunt trying to find out Person A's real name and address because they need to be ""taught a lesson"", Fetlife has no problem with this.

And this is not hypothetical; this sort of thing actually happens.  I'm personally aware of a prominent community member that has done several dodgy, consent violating things, and admitted to it in writing, but Fetlife is militantly enforcing his right not to have any of that discussed on the site.  Meanwhile, the caretakers have refused point blank to stop or delete his attempts to bully and dox his critics.

In short, Fetlife is great about 95% of the time; then it's a disaster of epic proportions.  And I have, personally, found that reddit (and especially /r/BDSMcommunity) is a vastly better forum for the discussion and online community I was relying on Fetlife for.  On the other hand, for finding events and kinksters in your area to socialize with, there's simply no competition.  Just be careful.

How do you not know? Ok let me paint a picture for you which *is* the end of the movie: the people land on the surface of the planet, the smartest one by a mile thinks you can grow pizza from a plant. They walk on the surface for the first time, everyone feels great, this is an exciting time. Ok, now what? After a few hours of looking around someone gets hungry, how to you food? Ok lets to back to the ship, they eat lunch. 

Ok I guess shelter is first on the list, how do you build a house? There are no trees, no tools, no industrial capabilities to make things like nails. That aside building a house is hard as shit, it takes a team of guys that know what they are doing a couple of days of work to erect a foundation. But you know what lets just say screw that, let's build a grass hut, wait there's no grass, I'm tired already, remember I'm morbidly Obese and just learned to walk yesterday. 

Ok back to the ship, day 3, I plant the seedling we found in the ground, ok now we just wait... And 6 months later we will have... Something, one of something... Do we even know if its edible? There's like 80 fat guys here c'mon we need to eat. 

Ok it's been 6 months and I finally made it to the point where I can walk a quarter mile without getting heat stroke lets look for something, wait there's nothing, except trash balled into squares, our ancestors used all the natural resources remember? Then they decided to program the robots to compact everything and not recycle any of it even though their robots had infinite energy. It's useless, seriously they didn't even separate the paper and the plastic? This is going to take even more time to get rid of. 

All the useful plants like trees take dozens of years to grow. There are no animals and there's no way in hell we are catching any if there are some, running? What is running, none of us have ever even walked before. Now what? Back to space I guess... The timescale of forestation and plant renewal on an entire planet which would be necessary to allow humans to live and grow the population is much much longer than all our lives combined. Guess we forgot that part... "

Well, they do - but it's not a primal urge in the same way that sex is.

But yeah, good point - but the solution to riding a motorcycle safely isn't to not do it, it's to do it with the right gear on.

You've essentially been arguing that one should avoid sex completely, in spite of their being measure one can take to avoid getting pregnant.

In fact, I  really don't know what the fuck you're talking about any more and I don't think you do.

People want to have sex without having babies. That's why they take precautions not to. Sometimes those precautions go wrong and peple still don't want a baby.

A baby isn't punishment for having sex.

Fuck me.

I told her I was in California visiting my dad, and she made it incredibly clear that she wanted to see me as soon as possible, heavily implying she wanted to hook up at last.

Conquestador,paradoxplaza,1388976059.0,"King Plaek of Siam, through manipulation of the reactionary elements in the country and assistance from Queen Elizabeth, modernized Siam, instituting many British policies, modernizing the army and instituting the British educational system. Siam grew quietly, conquering Indochina, expelling the Spanish from the Philippine Islands and the Dutch from the Celebes.

The Siamese Elephant rose, they seized Penang from the Malayans. The Siamese desired control of Singapore and its strategic strait, but under threat from the Chinese, the Siamese refrained from military action. In the Second World War, the British-French-Russian coalition fell to the Germans and Chinese, and were forced to dissolve their empires. The Germans occupied Southern France, and eventually returned the territories, excepting Vasconia and Catalunya. As the British and Russians retreated from Asia, the Siamese enjoyed a short period of greatness. 

For the lesser part of a decade, Siam sat among the Chinese and British in the court of Great Powers. In desperation to save their fall from grace to the rapidly reconstructing Russia, they launched an attack on the Free States in attempt to disassemble the FSA into quarreling, bickering states. 70k men landed in San Diego, and fought the Free Americans in Mariposa, where they were encircled and destroyed. The loss was so severe and the cost of retaliating so great that the Siamese hung their head and capitulated, admitting their first great defeat.

In the following 20 years, many decided that Siam's greatness had been unduly stripped from them, and desired to unify the country under a common ideology. The fascists and communists and Jacobins fought for control, and in October 1935, a Siamese general rallied 250k soldiers under the promise of national redemption uprooted the monarchy. they instituted a fascist Siamese dictatorship with the aim to unify all the South Pacific under the Siamese identity."

Well, the first thing that was a bit controversial was the fact that you made statements but did not back them up with viable sources. It's cool that you use these reasons (height and ethnicity) as the basis of your arguement and your beliefs in what women want, but you'll be more credible with sources backing up your statements.

Now, onto your statement of the idea that /u/Demoscraft 's race is of higher preference from women. Well, one thing you have to take into consideration is the location. If you are using the United States or any other country that has a predominantly white population, then I suppose you would be correct but I'm not entirely sure. However, to someone who is just reading it on a quick pass, they will look at it like you are using women in a general format a.k.a. the entire world. Going back to my first point, you need to back this up with a viable source otherwise people will instantly flame you.

The whole height accusation is something I've no clue on the validity of that so I think linking a source would just enlighten and inform most of us.

Finally, it's just kind of neither here or there to fight over facts that would be viewed as both racist and envious of /u/Demoscraft who merely listed their skin/hair color, and their height. I personally don't think that, but it takes all kinds to make the Internet keep on turnin' so you'll never know what people might think."

So this structure, I'm happy to report, is the tendon for the muscles in the claw.  In fact, the tendon is the backbone.  Some studies call them tonofibrillae, tonofilaments, intracuticular fibres, or intracuticular rods.  But essentially, they are tendon and connect the muscles to the body.  Cartilage might not actually be what these tendons are made of.  Nor may they be made of collagen.  In fact, nobody knows really what the heck they are made of.  At least not yet.  So, for the most part, they perform a mechanical function rather than a protective one.  "

Mayor Ford promised to reduce the city operating budget by $3 BILLION over his 4 year term. That's how much money he said there was to be saved. He was *wrong*.

He also guaranteed to do this without cutting services, which is a bald-faced lie after two years of TTC budget freezes and service cuts alone. Wrong there, too."

The Mandalorians are almost all extremely well trained warriors and Wolverine doesn't really bring anything to the table that they don't already have. This war in particular was also mostly decided by large interspace battles. There were a couple of strategically destroyed planets, too. Everything just happens on too big of a scale for Wolverine to do anything important. I'm not exactly sure of the numbers, but I'm fairly certain that the armies of both sides are composed of billions of soldiers.

Also, as HoboBrute noted, the the Jedi of this time are extremely powerful, though not as much as the later Jedi/Sith. Pretty much everyone in the fight is capable of (at least) telekinesis. I doubt they would be able to kill him, but they could almost definitely detain him. In this sense, Wolverine basically a slightly more powerful Mandalorian.

For the Mandalorian War's outcome to change due to one person, you would need someone who could kill thousands of people in minutes (in order to win a key battle or two) or a military strategist whose skill is greater than Revan's. You would need someone who realized just how willing Revan is to sacrifice his own troops to win."

m00nh34d,Android,1388976385.0,"""Apps"" (as in applications sold on the Google Play store and the Apple App Store, etc), are an interesting area of software distribution/categorisation. Traditional applications you'd purchase one, then you'd install that version and any included updates. If a new version was released, you'd either purchase a new version or an upgrade to that version. It was quite rare that you'd automatically receive the new version, unless you were subscribing to receive such upgrades.

Now days, with the advent of ""apps"", there seems to be some kind of expectation that these bits of software will be forever updated and upgraded after that initial purchase of the software. As a consumer, I kind of like this idea, I'm getting all these upgrade for free, essentially. When I think of the business side of things, however, it does raise some concerns. 

If this model continues, you are likely to reach a point where your income doesn't meet your expenses. Your app will likely get a large install base at some point, but then from that point onwards, you're unlikely to maintain the same level of monthly purchases. If you launch a major new feature you might be able to get a boost in sales, but at the end of the day, it's a finite stream of income. There is a possibility (quite unrealistic, but technically possible) that your app could be installed on every device out there, your operating costs to support such a large install base could be greater than the income being generated by entirely new users purchasing your app.

Not sure where things will go from here, but I'm suspecting we'll start seeing some changes to the way ""app"" licensing works over the coming years. Things like purchasing an ""app"" once and being allowed to install it on an unlimited number of devices, for an unlimited time frame, probably won't last. At the least I think we'll see options for developers to specify if an ""app"" is locked to *n* number of devices or unique installs, making users re-purchase it for their tablet and phones, for example. But time will tell on this.

The fact that you think the words or style i use is ""Trying hard"" shows your particular experience and education.

may i suggest that to the man with the hammer, every problem looks like a nail and your mathematician's brain is being offended by a spanner.

all that the ... infographic... is trying to show is that as time goes on, weight is gained and events occur which initially make a person realise they should lose that weight but that, commensurate with the weight gain and after that realisation has passed the probability that the person will follow through with that thought returns to the previous level and continues to decrease as weight is gained. 

the image seems to me an ideal way to say the above in a more accessible way and i think you have confused it with something visually similar but conceptually different that people of your profession use for a similar but more specialised purpose and are criticising it for that misplaced reason.

I don't have the answer because there's too many variables and the bleeding you experience on HBC isn't exactly the same as bleeding you experience without HBC. In one case, your body is responding to the hormones from the pill or implant and causing breakthrough bleeding or withdrawal bleeding accordingly. In the other case, your body is responding to the fact that an ovum has not been used and therefore releases the uterine lining that has built up over the previous few weeks. A pregnancy test would remove all doubt and I know women who don't get any bleeding while on HBC will sometimes take a pregnancy test once a month to have peace of mind."

We were both university students, however, so the age difference didn't seem as big (I was fourth year undergrad, he was PhD). We were in love, and it felt totally natural at the time. However, our relationship was mutually emotionally abusive, and we both had tons of issues. In retrospect, I think he was too old and experienced for me, and I think that my young age and inexperience is what kept me hanging onto an unhealthy relationship long after I should have ended it.

In general, I think life experience/where you are in life is more important than age. Where is she in her life? Has she graduated high school? Lived on her own? Does she have solid goals for her future that she is working toward? Has she had any serious relationships before you?"

Also, it's been easier for me to lose weight when the following conversation occurs in my head. Let's say I see an incredible looking pile of fries. I think to myself NOT ""OMG don't have those! You CANNOT!"" but the less harsh version of it, AKA ""Hm...blergyblergy...that's not the best choice. Wouldn't [healthy thing] be better?"" or ""Well, I know what they taste like already, don't I? Also, I will have these fries sometime in my life, sure, but I just shouldn't be having them right NOW."" It takes so much of the pressure off to tell yourself stuff like that.

It's kind of like if someone shoots down someone else's suggestion. They're finally asked, ""Well, do you have any better ideas?"" and they don't. Don't be that person for yourself. So if I say to myself, ""Don't have that. Don't have that,"" etc., it's missing the better option(s), which is not good for your mental health!

OpSmash,wow,1388977154.0,"This guy has no idea what hes talking about for a couple reasons. 

1. He is a gamer. Sorry, its true and this is the number one thing that ruins his credibility for an argument. 90% of gamer's or people that play video games have zero idea what it actually takes to balance a game development or a game mechanic. 

2. As a game designer I can tell you he has never heard of Dominate Strategy nor has he experienced balancing gameplay in any way.

3. In the bottom left hes playing League of Legends. He talks about adding anti-strategy into MoP to counter act adding new items into the game and it doesn't fix anything. Apparently this guy has no idea how LoL works because every class they release is an anti to a class they create. Brilliance. 

4. The whole thing with dispel shows me he never played arena at a high place prior to the dispel changes. Casters were pretty much negated by priest dispel spam and it made arena debuffs near impossible unless you cc'd the dispeller the entire time. [see dominate strategy].

5. The game is balanced around pve and pvp not pvp. Again, balance.

6. The guy rants about everything without giving a suggestion. It pretty much throws anything he can say out the window. If your going to cry and vent about it, tell me in all your infinite wisdom ZiQo, how you would change the game and continue making WoW a game which has monthly subscribers. Obviously you know everything being the streamer you are. 

If anyone knows ZiQo refer him to my post here, have him get in contact with me and I will explain game design concepts to him. Until then, hes just another idiot who thinks he knows how 'Game Balance and Game Design' is. pft."

cwolfe,pornfree,1388977387.0,I believe the best that can be done for those of us in active addiction is moving on and taking care of yourself. The partners of addicts become as crazy and obsessed in trying to fix the addict as the addicts are in trying to sustain their addictions. I am in SA as well as Al Anon and I have found this anon side of me harder to deal with because it is so tempting to get sucked into thinking that if I do something just right I can change the behavior of someone I care for who is harming themselves. As an addict I know I would not stop until I hurt enough to stop and those who tried to change me before then suffered from my resentful and abusive reactions to their efforts. This had nothing to do with me being good or bad. Rather it was a matter of being done or not with my addiction. No one who stayed with me could help me heal but watching those I loved walk away because of my behavior brought me close to my bottom. It isn't easy or pretty but it also isn't personal on either side. The addict does his thing until he is done and those around him have to get on with their lives and take care of themselves.

Coming out is probably one of the hardest points in any gay man's life, exponentially harder for straight-acting men, and I like the idea that the person trust us so much seek help from us in such trouble filled times in their lives. Every person is a unique individual and each coming out has special needs and special fears. Sure, a lot of them are the same for most gay men. However, there exists a unique power in hearing someone talk directly to you about your problems. This power cannot be replicated in self-help books or reading about someone else because that is about someone else. I find it cruel and heartless to ignore a very troubling time in someone's live because we have all been there and should know the fear and insecurity that he, whomever he is, is feeling. Gaybros is not going to get better if it stops posting coming out advice because it means that the community is so heartless or distant that the user does not truly feel comfortable there anymore. "

It centers around a young rancher that gets conscripted into the army. Initially as a scout, but later as a cavalry commander. It's much more focused on him personally than on the squads as a whole, but it otherwise fits what you're looking for.

I can't really give it all that strong a recommendation. While it has some good parts to it, it's not terribly memorable. In particular, the endings felt really rushed, particularly the ending of the trilogy as a whole. I also don't think the worldbuilding holds together well at all, but those flaws aren't apparent at first, and are never really in your face.

His ideal frequency is about 3-4 times a week; mine is 1-2 times every 1-2 months. And I have some issues that make it difficult for him to initiate (my body doesn't generally respond well to sexual touch, or affectionate touch turning sexual, unless I'm already turned on), so I'm almost always the one who initiates. I try to make sure we have sex 2-3 times a week, but sometimes I only manage once.

What I would give to have a decent libido...

I've had a number of partners who had higher (some, much higher) sex drives than mine, and some also felt entitled to my body. That's where my issues came from. My husband doesn't express the exaggerated sighing Look At How Disappointed I Am bullshit that they did, and his evenness and willingness to take care of himself is probably the biggest factor in me getting over a lot of those issues so we can have a normal sex life most of the time.

I want to point out that my feeling guilty is not due to his reaction to me not wanting to have sex at any given time. It's about holding up my end of things. There's not much he can do if I don't get myself in the mood; therefore I need to get myself in the mood on a somewhat regular basis."

attax,bodyweightfitness,1388978073.0,"Thanks to bodyweight fitness I've really changed. 

Three years ago, (well, 3.5) I graduated high school at about 300 pounds (carried it not too terribly, but still fat because I was/am 6'5''):
http://i.imgur.com/uxJhapY.png

During my freshman year of college, I took up running, coupled with a terrible diet I dropped to about 215. However, during sophomore and junior years I discovered this wonderful thing called alcohol and put back on about 50 pounds. I realized it was getting out of hand, and knew something needed to be done. I read a thread on reddit about what people are realizing getting older and it struck me real hard about people in their 40s and 50s starting to see their friends dying, particularly those who frequently drank and smoke. I was one of those people. I've done a lot with my life and didn't want to risk losing it at my Dad's current age. I really wanted to transform my life. I was tutoring a friend at the time who is a personal trainer, and was talking with her about my woes of going to the gym and lifting. I never really liked it, always felt intimidated, and never could stick with it for longer than necessary. At this point, it wasn't about being fit, or having a perfect body, it was about being healthy and taking care of my body so that I could enjoy life. I had taken up sports, and my performance was degrading, and I'm only 21! I knew something had to be done. This was the first time I wanted to do something due to my health, and not simply for vain. I had thought the only way I'd really accomplish any fitness goals was lift lift lift. She told me to check out doing stuff with my bodyweight as my own resistance. I scoffed, because my broknowledge told me that I'd just be weak and never accomplish anything. In her superior fitness (she teaches stand up paddle board yoga on a lake), she told me she was working on pistol squats. I had no idea what they were, but figured they had to be intense if she said she struggled with them. I imagined some explosive squat in a squat rack, like a bullet firing out. Then she showed me. I thought ""that's simple! you need to be in the weight rack."" I tried it, and got about 5 inches down before tumbling over. At that point, I realized there was more to fitness than how much I could lift, and found something that actually challenged me more than just adding more weight. 

In April, I started a bodyweight routine that I found on nerdfitness. It was good for someone like me. I could do it at home, so I wasn't intimidated to go to the gym. I saw progress. And I really liked it. I cut with it down to about 20% bodyfat, but really got stagnant. I tried making it more and more intense on my own, but it didn't get any harder. In September, I threw in a few weights and changed it up in the garage, but alas was still plateauing and not understanding why. 

I found this subreddit after I plateaued in a bulk. I was up to about 235 from 225. Not much, but still decent. I saw the beginner routine and thought it would be super simple. Only 4 workouts with rest? Come on, I do 5 circuits with 10-20 moves each for all parts of my body. Gimme a break...

And that's where I was wrong. It has been kicking my ass every since, but I've made great results. Not only do I feel healthier, perform better in my everyday life with a cleaned up diet and generally healthier eating. But I also found a workout that I LOVE doing. Additionally, I've added mass up to 260 pounds and dropped to 17% body fat. I'll cut soon, at the end of this month to hopefully drop it. But won't change this workout at all. I've gone from barely being able to get up on my hands to being about 12-18 inches from the wall for 60 seconds. Soon I'll transition into a full handstand, but I know I'm getting closer and every inch really challenges me. I've gone from Struggling to do L-sits with both feet on the ground to where now I can do a tucked one for a few seconds. A few really hard seconds, but I feel so accomplished. I couldn't even begin a pull up, now I can get almost 3/4 of the way up from a dead hang and feel like after my cut I'll be able to do, for the first time in my life, a pull up from a dead hang.  

My life is better, I love myself more and don't feel depressed about the future about my body, but instead, optimistic. This ended up being way longer than I thought it would be, but it became very stream of consciousness so if you managed to read all of it thank you. After all this, here is a bad shot, but nonetheless I look like an entirely different person in my physique:

rawkuts,androiddev,1388978074.0,"I'm not 100% I even understand the question, but I think this is what you want...

Way #1: Set up a web server that does the counting and replies back with the current count. For each group of 'friends', set up a unique URL so your web server can keep track of different counts. The phones can poll the server at whatever interval you want.

Way #2: Do basically the same thing, but with a shared Google spreadsheet. I haven't looked into the API, but I wouldn't be surprised if you don't have to poll and you can get a pushed notification when the data changes.

Way #3: Do the same thing as #1, except instead of polling, use the Google push API.

I'm sure there are many other services you can use for this, but those are the first ones that come to mind."

And Percy is totally cool with murder if his friends are in trouble. Kratos, despite being an extremely skilled warrior, moves at slightly faster than human speed. His major winning points are his strength and his brutality, but neither of those are effective against the invulnerable Percy. If we're bringing magic on the table, Percy's waterbending is almost as strong as GoW Poseidon's waterbending, and he's an overall much better fighter. Percy is capable of fighting hundreds of enemies at once. To quote from the wiki, ""In The Son of Neptune, even after losing the Curse of Achilles, he is still shown to be able to fend off an entire army of continually resurrecting ghosts by himself while still protecting Frank."" He just outclasses Kratos in pretty much every way except for his brutality.

$1 lipstick:
I have this in Classy, and it's the perfect pinky nude for me.  And I love that part of the tube is clear, so you can see the color.  I'm going to buy all the other colors!


$3 lipstick:
I have this in Flirty and Fabulous, and I love it, but I love the $1 lipstick more.  This one makes slightly chapped lips look terrible, so be careful!  But I think I'll buy some other colors anyway since I usually don't have chapped lips.  Oh, and I like the packaging on this one, too.  It's not clear, but it has a little stripe of the color in the middle.

$1 Eyeshadow Quad:
I have this one in Ocean Dreams, and it's a nice little quad.  Like, really little.  It's like 2x3 inches.  But that's okay; I'll never use it up anyway!  These are really nice colors and show up well over NYX jumbo eye pencil in Milk.  There is a lot of fallout, though.

32 piece eyeshadow palette:
This palette has such variety!  It has mattes, shimmers, and even metallics!  Woo!  I got this thing for free during one of e.l.f.'s many promotions.  (Everything's 25% off right now.) There are a few downsides to this palette though:  there are a few similar colors (like six black/dark grey colors) and some of the best colors are the smallest.

Prism eyeshadow:
I have this one in Smoke I think...  It's the green/blue/purple one.  All of the colors are shimmer in this one, and I like shimmer, so good for me!  This eyeshadow is more expensive than the others, but it's also higher-quality.  But one of my eyeshadows did break, and I didn't even drop it or anything!  But I was able to repair it.  :) I'm definitely going to buy this in the sunset-colored palette, and maybe the nude one.


Eyeshadow Beauty Book:
I have this in the nude-ish one.  I say ish because it also has an orangey-gold and a forest green.   I love this palette and I'm going to buy the other colors.  

Eyeshadow Beauty Must Haves:
I have this one in nude and it's the perfect nude palette for me. I will buy the other colors.

So in order of quality, I think from lowest to highest, the eyeshadows go:  tiny $1 thing, geometric 32 piece thing, beauty must-haves, beauty book, then prism stuff.  


I hope this helps!  :D

* Go LGA 1150, not LGA 1155; it's old.

* Best Hyper 212 model.

* Best Z87 motherboard for the budget.

* When it comes to GPU's, you **Go bigger now, double later.** You never go straight for SLI unless you can afford the biggest/baddest sheet of silicon &amp; still have money to throw away.

* This GTX 780 model is arguably the best available, featuring a very high factory overclock and a really nice aftermarket cooler. If stepping up means only affording a reference model 780 ti, the benifit is not worth the money unless you can afford more for a GTX 780 Ti 'ACX, Superclocked' model.

aquanautic,LifeProTips,1388978238.0,"Chiming in as well. The department store that I work for uses a seed spreader too. We use it all along the walkway by and between the doors (it gets fairly wide around the doors). We never put in more than we're going to use at one time. Works very well, basically can walk down the center of a path and be done with it--simple for someone who doesn't approach with much strategy or finesse. 

Compared to the method my apartment complex uses (grab a big cup full and dump it where we deem fit), it's way less wasteful and there's far less of an issue tracking salt inside (relative to the amount of foot traffic). "

It's just one of those things that's never happened to me. I'm rather introverted and quiet, so that doesn't help things, plus I'm not all that interested. Dating, to me, appears like a game that's not worth the effort, and I'd much rather devote my time to other things, so even if a guy approaches me, I'm unenthusiastic about the whole thing. Not that guys typically approach me, anyway; I must give off some sort of vibe (or lack of one?)."

With commitment comes obligations but also benefits. If you're already giving him all the benefits (love, support, sex, quality time), dating you officially just becomes about obligation (meeting parents, exclusivity, putting their needs ahead of your own) and that's definitely not how you want to start a relationship. 

""Ultimatum"" has become a dirty word, but all it means is that you're drawing a line about what you're willing to accept and what you're not. Telling someone you won't have sex with them if they aren't willing to be with you doesn't make you demanding or irrational; it shows you value yourself and think you're worth commitment. He's asking you to wait for his time, you can ask him to wait for your body. Right now you're doing all the giving - does that seem fair?

I don't think that sounds out of line. The dude was uniquely feared for the power of his punch. While he wasn't a great all-around boxer, give him credit where credit is due. He had one of -- if not THE -- hardest punch that modern boxing has seen.

That's what you *dream* of when you're a kid - the bully getting comeuppance.  

On the other hand, I do think that taller girl went a bit too far.  (Humiliation works better anyway).  I'm not making excuses for her, but these all seem like high school kids, and I wasn't always at my best in confrontations at that age either.  By college, I was bigger (and looked a lot bulkier in clothing than I actually was) and I couldn't stand seeing smaller guys get picked on.  I'm glad she stood up to that red-coated bully, but maybe she'll learn to do it with a bit more control if there's a next time.

Both Borderlands GOTY editions for $15 each-ish. Civilization Gold + all DLC for maybe $30 combined. Steam is also a perfect medium for early access games and alphas where you can buy in for a real low price instead of paying full retail value later.

balathustrius,jobs,1388978304.0,"I imagine it depends heavily on where you work, and OP should tailor his actions based on some gut feeling. That part of my advice came from the fact that although my ASMs didn't give a fuck about the employees, the store manager was often advocating for the bottom-rung employees. I think it was to set himself up as the good guy, and his assistants/shift managers/department managers as the hard asses. It also kept the ""hard asses"" mostly in line, because they didn't want to say X only to have the boss undercut them.

The district manager was kind of a dick, but if a problem *did* reach him it was automatically middle management's fault because part of their job was to insulate him from crap like shift allocation complaints.

Again, OP should take advice as he sees fit. He knows his situation better than we do."

Jourdin,Dogtraining,1388978306.0,"Your reply totally blew me away! Said everything that I meant to say and wanted to say but couldn't find the words for.

The only thing I'd dispute, though, is that certain breeds are more ""evolved"" than others, or that huskies/mals/shepherds are any more closely related to wolves than other breeds. Sure, they may look more like wolves, but that doesn't make them any less doggy. Some folks  argue that dogs did not even evolve directly from wolves that were domesticated, because wolves were *not* domesticated (at least not deliberately by humans).

&gt; I haven't seen any studies about different breeds' tolerances for aversive training though.

This would be interesting to see! My hypothesis would be that it depends on the individual dog, not necessarily the breed. Just as you get dogs from certain breeds that have more or fewer breed-specific characteristics."

Their leadership undoubtedly was thoroughly evil, though. Palpatine started construction of the Death Star *before* the Rebellion begins. Tarkin's idea of control through overwhelming fear was pretty clearly evil, given its need to destroy everything that opposed it utterly. Vader... well, he starts off his career in the Emperor's service by murdering dozens of children.

It's not in the movies explicitly, but the regime was also incredibly racist and sexist, implementing the Non-HuMan policy to promote only human males to higher ranks. Aliens and women were second-class citizens in the Imperial government, and only the most exceptional (Daala, Thrawn, Isard) moved up in the ranks.

Oh, and the Empire was enslaving the Wookies. They're actually pretty hard to defend as not evil unless you think that ""order"" is an unqualified good.

Zab18977,amiugly,1388978510.0,"Jesus kid, you look like a heroin addict. I know you're probably in a sort of nonconformity phase, but honestly, a little conformity goes a long way aesthetically.

First and foremost, you need to get a haircut. The whole emo shtick isn't really attractive to any older than 14 (unless you're interested in attracting [these](http://i.imgur.com/7CjeyNq.jpg) sort of women). I recommend getting a nice, simple crew cut. It will highlight your face and make you look relatively respectable.

Second, you need to change your wardrobe. You dress like Rick Owens if Rick Owens did all of his shopping at department stores. Now I'm not saying that you need to go out and become an MFA clone with a pair of Sperrys, a nice, crisp polo, and a pair of khakis, but you do need to get a grasp of the principles of fit, color, and style. I actually would recommend 4chan's /fa/ board for you, because it seems like you would enjoy their aesthetic preferences. 

Third, you need to hit the gym. Well, you don't *need* to, but you'd be able to fill out your new clothing better if you did. There are literally no downsides to getting fit. It's a positive lifestyle change for everyone that takes the time to dedicate themselves to it. I recommend doing Stronglifts 5x5 (google it) and then switching to a split routine like a Push/Pull/Legs sort of deal (google it again). /r/fitness is your friend; don't hesitate to ask any questions there.

The semantics wasn't really a part of my main argument; I was just correcting an error you had made. Your revision is correct.

&gt;Ah yes rape culture which can only be perpetuated by men towards women, yup no rape culture against men right?

Correct. There is no rape culture against men.

&gt;Seriously? You claim there is no rape culture against men, then in the next breath claim that ""oh when men get raped it isn't as bad as when women get raped"". Lets let that sink in for a minute.

&gt;Yeah, you literally in the same sentence claim there is no bias against men when it comes to victim hood of being raped, THEN have the audacity to claim that when a woman gets raped it is worse than when a man gets raped....

I said that rape isn't *as* bad for men *because there isn't a rape culture against them.* My one sentence saying that doesn't automatically create a new rape culture, does it? No, it doesn't. A rape *culture* requires a significant portion of society to subscribe to its views, not one person. Besides, what I said doesn't contribute to a supposed rape culture against men. If I had said ""men are sexual animals who secretly want you to rape them,"" then it would be contributing to a rape culture (if it existed). But I was simply pointing out that rapes are worse for women because people think they were asking for it or that they're lying and the man is being falsely accused - a ""false rape,"" if you will. That is rape culture, and men don't face the same difficulties when coming out with their rape stories."

What makes you say this? He throws childish tantrums when you guys fight. Shouldn't you judge someone based on the sum of their parts, the good times and the bad ones?

I'm saying this because rationalizations like ""he's a good guy"" or ""it's just during the bad times"" or ""if he reads the book he'll change"" are based on your hopes, not your reality. Those are things you tell yourself to cope because you can't handle the enormity of reality, which is that your fiance is a child, fights like a child, has very little emotional maturity, shows little ability to control his emotions, breaks things in anger, says things he doesn't mean, does not listen to you, is closed off and unwilling to change, has little ability to reflect on his issues..."

dottiepalooza,AskWomen,1388978693.0,"I think you're a little uneducated about both sides of it.  C-section is not a magic spell where you wake up with a baby.  It's a serious operation that takes weeks to recover, while also trying to take care of a newborn infant.  Every baby you have after that your insurance will want you to have another c-section, and the complications will be worse with every operation.  A natural birth is painful.  But, I think with proper education and training beforehand, it should be much less painful and dangerous than c-sections.  

I'd recommend you watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvljyvU_ZGE) documentary called The Business of Being Born.  It talks a lot about the c-section vs. natural birth."

To summarize, Titans handily lose. Many of our weapons have enough power to destroy a Titan's spinal cord thing despite hitting them in the foot through sheer concussive force. We have sniper rifles that could outright destroy most of them. Thousands would be needed to take important locations, and we have WMD's that would immediately destroy those thousands.

With modern intelligence agencies, it takes at most a couple of hours of fighting a battle that we'd already be winning in order to realize what their weakness is. Ten minutes later and everyone in the military knows it. Twenty minutes later and it's known to the worldwide military forces. An hour later and humanity at large knows their weakness because of 24 news channels. From there it would be titan genocide."

derleth,bestof,1388978712.0,"&gt; I don't think there will be institutions you have to physically travel to in order to gain access to certain data online.

I think there will be as long as there are people too poor to afford computers. Which may not be true in a few generations, but I've been surprised before.

&gt; They won't disappear tomorrow, but future generations will be born into an era where research is incredibly easy.

I think sifting the wheat from the chaff, even if you assume none of the results are outright nonsense, will still be a learned skill, requiring human-like intelligence to perform. Not to say that computers will never be able to do it, but it will be the province of humans alone for a long time yet.

Librarians, as I've said, are ideally the ones who spent the longest acquiring that skill, and so they should be employed to use it to help others. Libraries give them a place to do that."

At every faucet, arrange that both the hot and cold water have a very slow drip going.  It's not just a matter of preventing freezing, but also if it does freeze, it gives a way for excess pressure to escape.  One failure mode that most people don't understand is when a pipe freezes, forming a plug, and then continues to freeze further, greatly increasing the pressure on the remaining, trapped water.  All it takes is an escape path for that pressure to avoid damage."
Nognix,Nilesy,1388978787.0,"Ugh, whoever just used a throwaway of all things to respond to me and then decided to delete his comment. I'm sure you'll be looking at the thread to see what I'm gonna say to Nilesy anyway. I have a response typed out for you as well. You can read it if you want.
__________

I honestly didn't intend for it to be condescending at all, neither am I/was I mad upon writing. I was simply trying to explain the thoughts I had after reading Nilesy's answer to me. Unfortunately, it's the Internet and you only have my words to try and get as much information about the situation. As I said, I was not mad but I can see how it might come accros as condescending to a reader thinking I was upset when writing that. Once you get the idea in your head that someone was upset when writing something on the Internet, you'll instantly see everything that person wrote in a different light. That's just the way the Internet goes.

Anyway, I like people like TheAuzzieGamer, his channel is nothing but him giving sarcastic remarks on things like his Assassin's Creed gameplay which I think is hilarious. I like sarcasm and I'm very sad that he didn't have time to continue his channel anymore. However, you would think that a person who likes ""humor by sarcasm"" would have that same aspect returning in all of his videos. Because, if you are a big fan of sarcasm and irony and whatnot, it starts to creep up on you and it's pretty hard to drop that mindset and tone of voice whenever you want to be clear with people. That is why I didn't think it would be Nilesy's sense of humor because with him, that is not the case. He usually doesn't make any sarcastic remarks and that is why I thought it was weird. People that like that or like doing that usually have a channel centered around that like TheAuzzieGamer and in a lesser degree Totalbiscuit. That is the kind of humour you're most comfortable using because you personally think it's funny and you use it in day-to-day life anyway? Nilesy's channel is, again in my opinion, not centered on this so I thought it was pretty weird that he did this, it felt very forced and try-hard-y to me because the video was maybe of lesser quality with just the game and the commentary he did.

Finally, why are you using a throwaway to respond to me? I am not going to downvote you for disagreeing with me if that is what you think. As ironically as it sounds, I would prefer it if people showed their actual ""face"" aka their Internet name so to speak when I'm discussing things with them as it may give me an insight into their mindset, which is something the Internet desperately needs due to the limited amount of information you can convey, as seen by the situation at the top of the post."

Shopping with her was entertaining because we'd argue about everything from the colour of a coat we saw to politics.

Looking back, though, it probably worked because I saw her viewpoints as strange and hilarious and she probably thought the same of mine, but we knew it was just a difference in perspectives and that it wasn't personal in any way. If our debates were starting to get into personal/hurt feelings territory, my friend was outspoken enough to tell me so and if it was me feeling uncomfortable, I tended to just stop discussing it and my friend never pushed further."

By that time I'm not really sure if I was in love with them to begin with. At the very least, I've always fallen out of love; and I'm old-fashioned in that I want (and believe in) love that lasts a lifetime. This expectation/goal is driven strictly by lifetime happy couples I have had the privilege of knowing (i.e. not Disney Princess happily-ever-after crap... If real people can have it so can I).

I think I might be in love now though. I have never been so amused by a person... The things he does that *should* annoy me (like how messy his car is) I actually just love. Those little amusing things about him are pure unfiltered *him*. They're the kinds of things you wouldn't love about someone if you hadn't been close friends with them for years beforehand. I think that's what's different this time; being friends for years before getting together.  We've seen each others worsts and bests and we haven't run for the hills yet.

For our current situation: 

* If I wanna do it, LET ME. Sometimes a lady is just in the mood to give a bj; do not look a gift blowjob in the mouth. (Obviously this applies to when we're already fooling around, we're both into it, and he's just at the place of ""I feel selfish""...not actually trying to force it, everyone! Just trying to quell the over-thinking!)
* Moan. Get into it. Hearing him enjoying what I'm doing is really, really awesome.
* Tell me what you like and better yet, what you're in the mood for. If you want gentle, say so. If you want me to try to go deeper, say so. If you want me to be teasing, faster, whatever--say so! I like changing it up!
* Say other, general sexy things. How good it feels, how my mouth is the best thing ever, how close you are, etc.
* That said, I don't really like the attention being turned back onto me. I'm doing this thing, it's about you, you don't have to try to turn me on or worry about making me orgasm. It's always been kinda weird to me that guys want to turn a girl on and then request a bj. Shrug.

SharkMolester,Guitar,1388979356.0,"The main riff is based on a minor 2nd, which makes the minor2 feel like home until they hit the 1st.  They just keep bouncing back and forth between the minor2 and 1st.  The transition part has rhythm and bass just playing 1st while the lead plays minor 3rd and major third with some diminished 5th/ perfect 5th thrown in.

Now, the major third that gets played is the minor third of the minor second, so that feeling of minor2 being home until 1st gets played is still there.

The perfect fifth of the root is also the diminished 5th of the minor2, so again, that adds dissonance while still implying that the minor2 is also the root.

Basically, the whole song is built around trying to get you to hear the minor second AND the real root as both being the root.  Trying to trick you into thinking the m2 is the root then ripping the floor out from under you and playing the 1st.  The entire song is built around that objective, the dissonance and 'you think it's minor with a perfect 4th/5th, but it's actually diminished' is what you're looking for.  "

brutusthedinglefairy,keto,1388979822.0,"I'm not OP but this is what I use:

-10 eggs

-12 oz meat (bacon, breakfast sausage, chorizo, etc.)

-2 kinds of veggies (You want about 2-3x the volume of meat you have depending on how much they cook down. I usually use mushrooms, red peppers, broccoli, or spinach because that's what I normally have on hand.)
-1/4 cup heavy cream

-Salt

-Pepper

-Brown mustard

-Garlic powder

-Onion powder

-Other appropriate herbs and spices based on the flavor profile you're building (I like spice so I often put some red pepper flakes or paprika into the meat and veggies as well as the egg)

-Cheese

Cook up the meat and veggies, season with selected herbs/spices. While that cools a bit, mix up the eggs, HWC, mustard, and seasonings. Add veggies and meat. Pour in a greased 9x13 pan or divide between 12 muffin tins. Add a hearty amount of cheese. Bake at 350 until cooked through (it usually puffs up a bit and the cheese gets golden-brown).

I freeze them because I don't eat them every single day, but I'm sure they'd do fine in the fridge.

Bacon, 2x broccoli, cheddar cheese

Chorizo, red pepper, mushroom, onion powder, cumin, paprika, red pepper flakes, cheddar cheese

Here is what I have to say anyway.

My husband had one exchange like this long ago before we were married. It was long ago and I cannot recall the circumstances but he had cold feet about the wedding, wasn't sure if he really loved me, it never went beyond that, etc. 

Him losing me made him realize how much he loved me and we've been together over five years without issue. He doesn't like talking about it because he is so disgusted with himself. 

I took him back because I felt like sometimes we do stupid shit and I could look past it this once since it wasn't physical and not emotional either. Just stupid. Really stupid.  

He knows he cannot mess up again.

Yau thought outside of the box in ways not many other players have. One example is the fake idol -- I believe he was the first to think of this. Second and more importantly, the deal with Dreamz.

There is no way I can interact with children because I'll try to treat them like adults which doesn't work. Stories about pregnancy and birth honestly make me anxious and nauseous. I don't feel more pity for a kid more than I do for a person of any other age who deserves it. I don't feel any ""biological/imperative/involuntary"" drive to have them. Sure, my body ovulates by itself, but otherwise there's no subconscious feeling that makes me want to reproduce. Some people weigh the positives and negatives from childbearing, because the positives tend to be emotional factors like the fulfillment of seeing your kid grow up, and the negatives are more practical ones like the huge cost. Personally, there's no weighing to be done by me, because I don't feel like any of the ""positives"" are worth it."

meantforamazing,weddingplanning,1388980224.0,"I've actually been a 'replacement' bridesmaid. My friend's BFF, who she was super close with throughout college, but kind of grew from, was in her wedding. She then dropped the 'bomb' on her like six months before the wedding. She couldn't make the rehearsal dinner, and was worried she wasn't going to be able to make the actual wedding.

My friend said something like, ""I wanted to ask you from the get-go, and you're so important to me, I just didn't want to burden you with another wedding (I've been in numerous). Please don't feel like you're a replacement, because you're not."" I was flattered, and was happy to help my friend.

michaelnoir,todayilearned,1388980253.0,"A bunch of wealthy lawyers and merchants, the emergent bourgeois slave-owning class of the American colonies, decide that taxes should end up in their pockets instead of the pockets of the mad king of England, and so invent a country based on 18th century deism, John Locke, and republican Rome, whose outdated philosophical precepts Americans are still sticking to religiously almost 240 years later, because they only read the Bible and the Constitution and nothing else. 

The Americans are convinced that this bunch of wealthy lawyers and merchants, the emergent bourgeois slavemaster class of the American colonies, were perfect demi-gods almost like Jesus, who were right about everything for all time, and whose every word on everything holds tremendous weight, like the word of the deceased Kim Jong Il in North Korea. 

Their quaint mechanical Newtonian deism is mistaken for conventional mainstream Protestant religious fervour and Bible worship, and their archaic attachment to muskets and militias is taken as evidence that automatic weapons should be handed out to lunatics and infants. Their 18th century bourgeois mercantile liberalism is used as justification for full-scale plutocracy and giant bloated corporations draining American resources and labour, and their neat little bicameral-federal structure is infested with speculators and special interests peddling cheap illusions and Orwellian slogans.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1388980365.0,"I don't think it's cowardly. I can kind of relate. In my mind a c-section would be a lot less traumatic than a vaginal birth. I think a vaginal birth is just so unpredictable in a lot of ways. The anxiety about not knowing exactly what is going to happen and how bad the pain is going to get makes me panicky. With a c-section there's more of a protocol because it is a procedure. I would be more comfortable because I perceive it to be less of an unknown. But a c-section is major surgery and has it's own set of potential complications--not to mention the pain and longer recovery time that go along with it. Who knows? A natural birth may be a lot less painful for you than a c-section, but I think whatever makes you less stressed and anxious during your pregnancy is best.  "

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1388980370.0,"I had some fear surrounding the actual birthing, but my big fear was the not knowing when.  The elective C-section was scheduled early on.  I had a date that, barring early labor, I knew I would be having a baby.  I knew how the C-section would go.  There were a lot less unknown elements.  Having more known elements decreased my overall anxiety.  I couldn't take my anxiety meds when I was pregnant, which I knew I wouldn't be able to, so I had to work around in ways to decrease extreme stress on my body.  Constant panic attacks aren't really good for fetal development.

Was it ideal?  No, but having severe anxiety isn't really ever ideal, so I make do with what my options are.  It was planned in coordination with my psychiatrist and OB/GYN backing the decision, so I stand by it."

MattieShoes,learndota2,1388980373.0,"Drow is an early mid game carry and ganker.  Shadow blade is extremely common on her.  She's also one of the most powerful pushers in pub games.  Most commonly goes mid, but can farm from any lane.  She's vulnerable to heroes with gap closers... PA, Antimage, Riki, etc.  

Dragon Knight is a tanky semicarry with spammable abilities, though he may have mana issues.  He's also quite good at pushing down towers.  Also most commonly goes mid, but can also go pretty much anywhere.  If he's in a sidelane, a ranged support is good (double-melee is teh bad).  His item choices are wide open and vary with the situation.  Sometimes shadow blade for ganking and initiating, sometimes just pure tank items (armor+STR) for fights and pushing.  His dragon form has a DOT **that works on towers**.  Use this to your advantage.

Omniknight is a melee support that needs levels.  This makes him a bit odd, as you don't really want to lane with a melee farmer and you don't want to be in a trilane.  He's hard to fit into a lot of lineups.  Sometimes he goes mid just to secure early levels.  Mek is an obvious choice for him, along with tanky items and some form of mana regen.  Your degen aura is no joke, so if you can take the abuse, you want to get in their faces.  His ulti pretty much ends teamfights.  With extreme farm, he can be a halfassed carry simply because he becomes too hard to kill."

Something to do with how having a minimally varied diet can alter their stomach flora... or something like that.

sami4400,DotaConcepts,1388980548.0,"**Name:** Konte, the ex-creep

**Primary Attribute:** Inteligence

**Stat Gains:** Str: 22 + 2.4, Agi: 12 + 1.3, Int: 29 + 2.5

**Movement Speed:** 300

**Turn Rate:** 0.5

**Attack Duration:** 0.55 + 0.55

**Cast Duration:** 0.3+0.4

**Base Attack Time:** 1.7

**Base Damage:** 58-62

**Lore:** Many Heroes come from turbulent pasts where they endure many difficulties and become fearsome warriors. But few people pay attention to the creeps, those soldiers gave their bodies and souls for a battle that their likely outcome is to die for a noble cause. And Konte was exactly that, a simple creep he vowed to defend the radiant cause at all costs, even if it meant that he would have to give his life for it. One day during an enduring battle against Dire forces, Konte was surprised with an enemy that had such power that could defeat his entire squad with a single right blow from his sword, Doombringer. But as much as the odds were against him, he didn’t back away a single inch, as his squad went to attack that fearsome beast, they were struck one by one by the demon's sword. As he stood alone against the enemy after all his friends had died, he knew that his ultimate fate was bound to be fulfilled in that exact moment, but he was wrong. His destiny was far worse than all had died, his destiny was to be devoured by the mighty Doom. But he couldn't simply die after vowing to protect the Radiant, as his body fell into the monsters mouth, his will kept him bound to this world and as he realised, he was no more than a ghost, a chunk of pure consciousness that had as his only objective protect the Radiant. As his mind moved trough the battlefield, he tormented himself  wondering how he could help his fellow mates. Until the moment he encountered a dead creep's body, he knew that it would have to do. As his mind fused with that wounded corpse he felt a new life surging from inside. His iron-like will and devotion modified the body in an strange way and as he reawakened he was no more a creep, he was a true hero.

**Abilities:**

**Ability 1:Ride a Creep**    

Duration: 30/40/50/60s      Cooldown: 20s    Mana cost: 30/40/50/60

Konte leaps on an ally creep and starts riding him, gaining any ability the creep have for the duration, also 80%/70%/60%/50% post-reduction damage that Konte would receive is tranferred to the creep, Konte's MS is increased for 30/70/110/150. If the creep dies, Konte is dispeled from all buffs and debuffs, also Konte can leap off the creep anytime killing the creep only if the creep is affected by Creep Bomb, else the creep stays alive. Also Konte is disarmed for the duration and any attack command is issued to the creep, which has Konte's damage and IAS added to its own as a buff called ""Rallied"". Also, any ability that would affect creeps now affect Konte in a similar way(ex. Hand of Midas could kill the creep, Devour would kill the creep, Death pact would kill the creep, naix could infest the creep, but none of these abilities would affect Konte's HP)

*As his only objective was winning the war, Konte would neve hesitate in riding his fellows into certain death*

**Ability 2: Creep Bomb** 

Duration: 8s Cooldown: 15s   Mana cost: 70/90/110/130

Konte manipulates a ally or enemy creep's mind making him willingly suicide on death for a greater cause. Apllies a debuff for 4s and if the creep dies during the debuff or the timer ends, it explodes causing 28/56/84/112 composite damage to the creep and to nearby enemies in a 300 aoe and a 10/20/30/40% MS slow that reduces to 0 over 5s,, if the explosion is caused by the creep's death the damage is doubled, if the killer is Konte the Cooldown is halved and the damage is tripled.

*Konte's will is something so strong that could convince others into suiciding for his purposes*

**Ability 3: Submission Aura**  

Passive   

Konte emanates an aura that forces his enemies into submission. Whenever an Hero is within 300 units from Konte, he will begin to to be continuously slowed at a rate of 3/6/9/12%  MS per second and 2/4/6/8% IAS per second until the MS slow reach 60%. When the slow reachs 100% the enemy will be stuned for 1s and be damaged for 50/100/150/200 composite damage. After the stun, or leaving the aura the enemy can only be reafected after 9/8/7/6s.

*Simply the presence from Konte makes one realise that he doesnt stand a chance versus such an enduring warrior*

**Ult: Loyalty's Call** 

  Duration: Permanent   Cooldown: 40s    110/150/180

After a 1s Cast time, Konte is able to summon one of the true pure souls he met trough the battlefield. Summons a random especial creep from an list to aid Konte. Each one of them have especial abilities and they are under Konte's control, also Konte can ride them with no limited duration.
**Aghanim's Scepter upgrade:** Increase's each creep's power and adds a sub-ability that lets you select the creep.(Everytime you press the sub-ability the selected creep changes like Creep1&gt;Creep2&gt;Creep3&gt;...)

*As his mind wandered trough the battlefield, he encountered minds as willingly to fight as him, and so he learned to summon them to aid him in his fight*

1. When ***EXACTLY*** would the change occur? Would it happen around the globe all at once? Would it only happen when people were asleep? What about astronauts? Would they be included? How about active firemen, policemen... Soldiers, even. What if some guy was sneaking through a building, rescuing his stolen partner from the enemy as they tried to torture intel out of him, and suddenly, out of the blue, a tail and wings pop out of his back, knocking over the sofa he hid behind, and exposing him? How *exactly* would it happen?

2. Would anyone who had no fursona, spirit animal, pet, etc. be ""assigned"" one at random? Would they get to pick subconsciously? Consciously? Would all of these people be marked unfit for society and turn into anthro-hagfish?

3. What about us, the Furries of the earth? Would we become our fursonas? Would we ""pick"" what we want to be? Would we hear about this rapture beforehand? Would furry hobos cry out to the streets ""The Furmageddon is nigh!""?"

I met my current girlfriend over a year and a half ago but we were only friends until recently.  I remember that the first day we saw each other we met through mutual friends and hit it up and ended up traveling around the city that our university was in for the day.  We traveled around the city for a good three or for hours, eventually we got hungry.  We went to dinner and went back to my place and talked for several hours.  Eventually we went to her place and and talked for several more hours (I was incredibly nervous, I wanted to do something but didn't know how).  After a few hours we went to a club and after we were done she said ""well what now?""  Saying I was just nervous was an understatement, I hadn't been this close to a girl in a year.  I told her I was tired, gave her a (quick) hug and walked back to my dorm as fast as my feet could carry me.  

I was incredibly embarrassed by that but all the same I whipped my dick (I had been semi hard for at least 4-6 hours) out and jerked off for the first time in two weeks, I was hornier then I had ever been in my life.  After a few minutes I came, my entire body bucked, it was by far the strongest orgasm I have ever had, I came and came, my load that night would have put any porn star to shame.  My balls looked and felt like a massive amount had been released.  I wiped myself down and took a nice long shower.

If you do want to read this exchange, you should know that I started replying to the now deleted comments of a throwaway account. Then while I was typing this post, I noticed Nilesy had read the post intended for the throwaway account already while the throwaway account had deleted his posts while I was typing my reply to them. I didn't just want to throw all that I typed in the bin so I posted it anyway as a reply to my own post, instead of to the throwaway it was intended for.  I marked the point at which I saw that somewhere in this thread. Everything said after that is written with Nilesy's reply to me in mind so with the thought of: ""Phew, Nilesy isn't extremely mad at me.""

**--Warning: Very long read ahead.--**

Sorry, I want to say that you completely misread my comment. I said that I did not intend to make any personal attacks on you and yet you still take my comments after that as such. I was not angry when writing my comment, I am not angry now. I do understand however that you might be under the impression that I intended for my reply to condescending or something, this was not the case. I want to make this perfectly clear. You misunderstood a lot of what I said, this is definitely due to English not being my first language and probably missing some of the finer nuances of the words I used.

Now I want to go over what I said and your comments to it and try to explain what I actually meant.

&gt; I'm not really impressed by Nilesy's flippant use of afteredited words.

First of all, I kind of meant this as a little joke for myself. I learned the word ""flippant"" quite recently actually. I learned it one of TB's ""Lord of the Arena"" videos where he used it as such: ""Are you not impressed by my flippant use of cards?"". You might think all of this is irrelevant but it will explain why I used it in the situation.

As stated, the usage of the word ""flippant"" was an injoke for myself only, basically because I thought TB's line was so great I wanted to use the word myself someday. However, TB used it in such a lighthearted manner that I, having not looked up the real meaning of the word, thought it was sort of a lighthearted way to say something like ""exuberant but also a bit thoughtless"" or something. I don't know, it's very hard to explain. So, I think it is safe to say I misunderstood the finer nuances of the word, not realising it actually has a negative tone to it. I am sorry for that, as it is completely my mistake.

&gt;Oh damn, are you this Nilesy I've been hearing so much about. Coincidence seeing you here, eh? 

Ok, this first part is me wanting to answer Nilesy's sarcasm with my own. As stated to the reply to the throwaway that deleted his comments.

&gt;There, now that both our snarky remarks are out of the way, we can actually talk sensibly.

As I said in my reply to the throwaway, I am one of the people that likes to use sarcasm and irony. This part is not meant to be condescending. This is a merely a habit of me explaining: ""Ok guys, I'm gonna be serious now."" which is very important when it comes to conveying things in text form as well as a habit I picked up from real life.


&gt;First, the Reddit hivemind instantly thinks that I'm trying to attack you or your content which is obviously not the case otherwise I wouldn't be in and subscribed to your subreddit.

This part is meant at the Reddit hivemind in general. I have experienced firsthand what Reddit does to dissenting opinions in places like these, subreddits dedicated to one particular topic. It was meant as a sort of way to say: ""I am not trying to be a troll, I am trying to discuss something. Read before you downvote then do whatever you like."" I know there is no stopping the hivemind but this was basically a callout to the bastards that downvote things in a discussion without actually leaving a reply. I'm fine with people downvoting me but please leaves replies, it's a discussion after all.

&gt;Second, it is entirely possible that I misread you. If so, I have 2 questions. If you truly think this adds enough extra value to your video then why not do it on every video? I'm sure it doesn't take an awful lot of time to edit and better videos mean extra subscribers mean your livelihood is more secure.

At this point I have seen that you have answered my other comment, which wasn't actually meant for you but whatever. I'm also far enough into this already that I'm just gonna keep typing it for future reference.

Again, not at all meant to be condescending. Just trying to explain my thoughts on how YouTube as a livelihood works. This is coming from someone that doesn't have or want a channel. My thoughts are that you will get more subscribers if you increase the quality of your videos. If you think something increases the quality of your videos then by all means go ahead and do it. 

&gt;*Why don't I do it all the time? Jees, because I just thought it'd be fun to try something different? Like, I did it for fun, that's all. I wanted to see what people thought about it, I experiment with my vids sometimes and change things up, this was just one of those cases.*

(Nilesy's quotes will henceforth be quoted in italics.)

 Yep, that's fine. I just thought that after so many years of succesfully creating videos you'd have figured out the best formula by now. Don't tell me it isn't true, every YouTuber grinds the numbers. They look at statistics and work out which videos did best and why they did good. I know you want to do the best you can so you have definitely done this before.

&gt;Also, why didn't you shape your channel to be something centered on your ability to deliver witty remarks then? Something like TheAuzzieGamer's Multiplayer Mayhem or Reynold Sanity's beautiful destruction of Rome II Total War (Yes, I know this isn't a very good example.) for example.

This was meant as an addition to the first one. I know you have grinded the numbers before. You know what works best and you do a damn good job at whatever works best for your channel.

You have run your channel for this long already that if you thought doing a style of sarcastic commentry would generate more views, you would have started doing it already. This is why I thought this wasn't your sense of humour and why I said in the other comment that it felt kind of forced to start doing it now, especially because it was obvious that the video's quality was a bit lower than your average video because of the game section not being very interesting but also because of your own commentary at the time. Sorry.

&gt; *Your opinion is grand, as of course you are entitled to it, and that's great and I'm happy for the feedback, that's the nature of experimenting. The reason I responded to you was because you were answering on my behalf which I am not okay with. Dictating what my humour is, or what I find funny, or why I do things, are reasons known only to me. Upon re-reading, I notice that again you feel you can speak on my behalf: ""you don't care about single fans"", genuinely, stop that. You don't speak for me.*

I didn't mean to speak on your behalf. In my first post, I didn't expect for the Nilesinator to show up himself and correct me. However, in my defence, I did specify that what I said was my own opinion and everyone thinking I knew you better than anyone else is frankly an idiot.

&gt;*Dictating what my humour is, or what I find funny, or why I do things, are reasons known only to me.*

I have tried time and time again to make it abundantly clear that what I'm saying is my own opinion. I am not giving people reasons for why you do things or saying people that this or that is your sense of humour. No, I'm trying to make speculations about what your reasoning might be as well as giving people an insight into my own ideas.

&gt;*Upon re-reading, I notice that again you feel you can speak on my behalf: ""you don't care about single fans"", genuinely, stop that. You don't speak for me.* 

You misunderstood this completely. I probably worded it wrong though so sorry for that.

I was not saying you didn't care about your fans. In that paragraph, I was trying to say you shouldn't care about what single fans think or ask. Opinions of single people, such as mine, should not influence you in how you make your videos. You cater your content to the masses, adapting to please one single person is ridiculous. I'm quoting my paragraph again for reference:

&gt;It's possible that other people liked this system better, if so, you might actually want to change the way you make your videos up, which is completely fine by me. You produce content, I watch your content. If I don't like your content then I will just stop watching it, not that anyone cares because you don't care about single fans, I am perfectly replaceable.

 I was trying to give you my vision on how YouTube works for me. You provide content for people to watch. I choose if I watch your content or not and that's the only relation we have. You provide, I consume. And as much as I would like the opposite to be true, we are not friends. That's why I was trying to say that I wouldn't blame if you didn't listen to my opinion. You have to appeal to the masses and do what the masses like. If I don't like your entertainment anymore, I will simply stop watching and you shouldn't and probably wouldn't be upset with the loss of a single fan. That is why I bluntly said: ""You don't care about single fans."". I am part of the mass you provide content for. If I don't find a place for myself in that mass anymore, that's fine, I am perfectly replaceable.

Besides the magic macguffin cannon, that is. In actual history, cannons were pretty much *the* early driver of gunpowder in warfare.

That sort of gun requires a fair bit of precision work to create, and the society depicted just didn't seem to make use of it. I'll grant that we never saw more than a small slice of society, but we still saw enough that it should have been more present.

It also bugged me that everything was about Cavalry. That made sense for the steppe tribes, and maybe the nation that immediately bordered them, but not for everyone else. Where's the infantry? This wasn't a world where everyone lived and died on horseback. These were expensive animals, in limited supply. Especially when you start factoring in the urban population, the states should have been fielding at least half their army as infantry, probably more. Napoleon's army, for instance, had about 1/5 cavalry.

But those are just little gripes that bugged me while reading. Most of my reservations had more to do with the ending than it did with the worldbuilding."

1) Yes.  

2) It will be signed, witnessed and notarized.  Your attorney will handle most of that.

Follow up question: ""Can I make up a form myself online or something?""

No. These agreements get thrown out all the time by judges.  Even ones that are professionally written up.  If you want any chance of this holding up pending divorce, get a good lawyer and stay away from Legal Zoom.

screenmagnet,sex,1388981878.0,"Blow job tips: intentionally gag yourself on his cock a few times near the start. This will bring up a whole bunch of phlegm from the back of your throat. This has the consistency thick, amazing lube. Coat his penis in it and go to town. It makes deep throating way easier and your hand will slide easily up and down his shaft. Use your right hand on his shaft (go up and down in a twisting motion with your hand, in sync with your mouth). On every upstroke, twirl your tongue on the underside of the head. Use your left hand to massage his balls. When you need a break, bring up some more phlegm, coat the head of his penis and the palm of your left hand in it, and then rub the palm of that hand in circles directly on the head of his penis, while you continue the twisting up and down motion with your right hand.

Other things to do: 
gently take one ball at a time in your mouth and suck on it gently while massaging with your tongue.

Twist his penis between the open palms of both hands.

Give a two handed handjob: start with both hands gripping the middle of the shaft. Twist the right hand up, over the head, and back down (thumb rubs the frenulum on the way down). Simultaneously twist the left hand down to the base in the opposite direction of the right hand and back up to the middle. I.e. Right  hand twists up and counter clockwise while the left hand twists down and clockwise, then reverse as you bring both hands together at mid shaft again.

When deep throating remember to take a deep breath on the way down and then exhale on the way back up.

You should definitely try to get a Drogskol Reaver. It's just an incredibly good card in general, and it does a huge amount of work with Oloro. I would also recommend putting in some more board wipes in addition to Nevinyrral's Disk: Toxic Deluge, Wrath of God, Day of Judgment, Supreme Verdict, Plague Wind, Life's Finale, Damnation, etc. (not all of them, necessarily, but adding a couple is good). Oloro plays very well as a slow control deck, so you're probably not going to have many creatures out, and board wipes will hurt you much less than everyone else.

If you do decide to make it more control-y, you can't go wrong with more removal and counterspells. Ashes to Ashes is another card along the lines of Reckless Spite (both of which are amazing since the life loss doesn't matter and you get rid of two threats for only 3 mana).

I would also recommend adding in some cards with Extort. It really helps with the life drain and gain that Oloro does so well. I'd say the best Extort cards are Pontiff of Blight, Blind Obedience, Crypt Ghast, Treasury Thrull, and Vizkopa Confessor."

You have to be either really good at defending takedowns and have that be part of your game plan, or you have to hang on to some nearby object the way Yoshiki Takahashi did when he fought Wallid Ismail.

On the other hand, both height and weight are pretty important for Muay Thai, it's quite rare that someone who's your size is able to fight someone the size of a football or hockey player and have much success, regardless of training. 

That said, you're right about the leg kicks, most people on taking a couple hard ones probably won't be able to run as fast as you, so they would facilitate your escape. Muay Thai's clinch game would also help you break out if someone has you clinched, so you can us the kicks and run. Using the clinch offensively won't be so effective, particularly against anyone taller and heavier than you.

If you have wrestling available to you, learn that, it'll help you take the fight to the ground if you're being attacked by a power hitter, and stand back up if you've been taken to the ground. It'll help you break from being clinched better than Muay Thai would. "
foolish_mortals,OkCupid,1388982081.0,"&gt;Forgive the novice question but what is it about meeting in person that makes it so different from talking every day/skyping/whatever?

I will present my anecdotal evidence. I was home for a summer and started a relationship with a friend I had in high school. I knew him, he knew me, we were on the same track team in hs. We Skyped once a week talked every day. Visited for about a week every holiday. Well I moved back home after graduation so we got to hang out multiple times a week...He drove me crazy, he was much more moodier and now that we had more time together we wouldn't go on dates. He then started to get upset that I didn't do everything he wanted me to (stay over every night, trespassing, etc) 

Keep in mind I had MET this person, I supposedly KNEW this person. It did not end well. So with that said people keep a different face online, in text, and on the phone. In person when you spend more time their true character starts to come out."

Before the colossal and armored titans arrived, it seemed like life was fairly uneventful within the walls. Maybe it wasn't, but I don't think we've seen enough of normal human life before that event to say it was a daily struggle for survival. It certainly didn't seem to be a daily struggle for survival between humans, and based on what the stationary troops said, it seemed like no titans posed a risk at that time. "

Check around [here](http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/dell/) as they're a much more active forum for the device than reddit is, there's a fix floating around that involves disassembling the stylus mechanism and stuffing and taping the circuit board inside. Apparently the circuit board wiggles too much in a lot of styluses, and while many styluses are probably working fine, I received a stylus shortly after Christmas that was complete garbage out of the box. I was able to get it mostly working by just pushing the tip into the stylus very hard, but every so often hover clicks and tails come back and I have to do a bunch of stuff that reminds of hitting those old CRT TVs to get it to work (disconnect the battery, shove the tip in very hard).

That being said, it's pretty likely that you'll be able to get a stylus to work with the tablet, but there's also a high chance that there will be defects with it. I'm willing to live with it for now, but when I go back to school in a couple weeks, I might get irritated enough to attempt the fix myself or buy another stylus and hope for better luck."

I'm convinced there's another reason. If you're running a for-profit prison, who's more likely to become a potential future criminal? One that had a great support structure, including a loving mother and father? Or one where the kid wasn't even wanted and if the mother had a choice would have aborted? Can't have all of these ~~slave prison laborers~~ fetuses killed, don't you know?

This I also suffer. I use a nice mousse when my hair is wet, although some days it still won't hold. 

I mostly do no heat and overnight tricks to hold curl. I do the headband trick (Not me, but she does it too http://www.justlaine.com/2012/02/no-heat-headband-curls-experiment.html). This always works for me as long as your hair is dry and you keep it in for all night and maybe a bit more. 
Try to style using second day hair as often as possible too!
Good luck with your plights"

Beer: Yes. I highly suggest Jungle Jim's (either location) or Party Source in Newport for your go-to beer hauls, though the grocery stores have gotten better about this, too. The bars around here don't mess around, either. You can go into any bar and they'll be stocked with local craft brews.

Sports: Liking the Reds is almost a requirement to live around here. We also have the Cyclones if you like hockey, but other than that you're kind of fucked.

Liquor: Most places around here make you go to liquor stores, though I don't think anyone around here refuses sales on Sundays anymore. Most grocery stores will either have a liquor store inside their stores (Meijer) or beside their stores (Kroger)."

It's pretty easy to tell if a guy is lying. He'll be vague, he'll trip up on the details, and his story won't hold together. Eventually you'll be able to spot the liars immediately.
