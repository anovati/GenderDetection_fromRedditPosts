Noneerror,AskReddit,1389600631.0,"Oh something else I forgot. As there was no will and it was intestate the bank can ask the probate court to be named the legal administrator of the estate. If that happens (or already has) then the bank effectively already own everything. They can just decline other claims against the estate. Thereby requiring any other claimants to sue the bank which won't be worth it. The bank can then just run out the clock adding fees to their administration of the estate until it's net worth is zero. Then sell it to settle the remaining debts of the estate (which are debts to themselves) and take possession that way.

I doubt that applies to your situation. It has a high likelihood of applying to the OPs case though. The fact that the bank is paying the property taxes speaks volumes. You don't pay someone else's property taxes unless you intend to take the property. It's a flashing neon sign of a red flag sc"

No, I don't think performance is the problem. What I've read MySQL can even be faster than MS SQL.

I don't know what other data is in the Wikipedia database, but that's not what I thought of when I say ""important data"". I thought more of things like personal data, bank accounts, report data, etc.

&gt; Lots of financial data, prices, shares, EBITDA. News reports, etc. Reports themselves aren't in the database, but the data which makes up the reports is. The reports are simply templates in which data that is requested is filled in.

Most of the reports we have come from the cube, it wouldn't be possible to get the data out of a relational database.

&gt; The different access roles are handled by different users who have different permissions and access to different tables and databases. 

So many users are sharing the same account? We would get some serious audit problems.

Merawder,standupshots,1389600676.0,"&gt;Any time a DUI is mentioned or someone admits to it the white knight brigade comes out and shames the poster. 

Eh, many people have lost loved ones to people driving under the influence. Why would a consistently negative reaction be surprising or unreasonable, or in any way reddit specific as you originally implied? 

Also, I don't think you know what a white knight is.

&gt;I'm not saying that driving drunk is ok, but I am saying it's far from one of the worst things you can do.

Literally everybody on this website likely agrees with you, the fact that people criticize it when it comes up doesn't conflict with the belief that there are worse things someone can do, like murder and rape and whatever else.

&gt;DUI is such a blanket term in which we get no context so you shouldn't be so quick to judge.

Lol, what? How is DUI in any way a blanket term? It means you were caught driving under the influence, and multiple DUI means you continue to do it even after punishment. What context makes DUI acceptable, other than spectacularly unlikely ones? (I have to DUI now or the aliens blow up the planet? What?)

For some reason they respond well to me. All girls who ever showed back interest in me were asian.

With possibly the exception of the last case, which is obviously based on personal experience, this user is not attributing some kind of personality onto Asian girls.  Like you said, people have preferences when it comes to physical traits.  That's fine.  But most of these posts go far far far beyond simple physical features.

I see a guy with nice defined arms, and I think, that guy has nice defined arms.  That is attractive.  That is neither objectification nor fetishization, because I am not reducing this person to one bodily part, nor am I attributing any other characteristics to these men.  I don't see a guy with such arms and think, he must be a smart, funny, witty person.  

I am an Asian woman and my boyfriend is, like you, a ""lao wai"".  He's also historically dated mostly Asian women and is primarily attracted to Asian women.  I don't demonize my boyfriend, because liking asian women does not equal yellow fever.  He's attracted to physical aspects of Asian women.  Where yellow fever begins is seeing someone not as a person, but as only an asian woman, and whatever ideas one imposes onto asian women.  Yes, I am an asian woman and that is an important part of me, but it is not all of me.  Some of the men in this thread, and [elsewhere in the world](http://creepywhiteguys.tumblr.com/), would look at me and think, she's an Asian woman, so she must be super feminine, gracious, born to be a house wife.  That's when I feel like an object, because I as /u/desolee no longer exist.  I am only an Asian Girl.

gth68,AskReddit,1389601248.0,"I would just like to say that while these stories may be true, and do indeed happen, academics are just as important to most student athletes as sports are.  I just finished my last year as a D1 football player and am now getting ready to finish my last semester of college.  I never cheated or asked for a grade I didn't deserve.  The fact of the matter is I had a full time job on top of playing, and as a sciences major, I took hard  classes (Orgo, physics, bio, assorted courses that dealt with my major) and finished the past three semesters with a GPA over a 3.4.  My point in saying all this is not to brag, but to just say that we really are , for the most part, just like normal students.  It's like that NCAA commercial where they say almost all NCAA athletes will go pro in something other than sports.  It's the truth.  It use to bum me out when classmates or group members would just assume was stupid or didn't care because I was an athlete.  Alright, that's my rant.  Thanks for listening.

I'm just saying that we are all fine ppl and there is no one superior and inferior. If someone is good at one thing then someone else is good at something else. And you know what there might be someone who's good at nothing and it's all fine. As long as you're staying alive that's fine.

Vampire colonies are essentially communistic because everyone pulls their weight, of course this only works if you cut off the weakest links in your society.

In the US at least we help these people but some abuse the system and like you said, have tons of kids which often end up being raised to leech off the system. Poverty grows and government dependency is on the rise, which results in a larger voting pool in support of yet larger government (for entitlements). Eventually the middle class is crushed under the weight of the lower class that leeches off of them and expects the government to provide for them instead of providing for themselves. When the masses realize they can vote themselves money is when our society collapses."
GeeJo,gameofthrones,1389601346.0,"(You note that you've already seen **Breaking Bad** and **The Walking Dead**, so I'll leave them out of the list.)

Together with Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad, **The Wire** and **The Sopranos** are the other two central pillars of modern television storytelling. You simply need to have seen them (or at least attempted them) if you want to understand how we got to television serial dramas as we have them today.

Other plot-driven shows unafraid to dive into blood and muck include **Battlestar Galactica**, **Oz**, and **Rome**. I've been told **Spartacus** should also get a place on the list but, personally, I was unable to get past the cheese. 

The *first* season (and only the first season) of **Heroes** is very much worth watching, as are the first few series of **Dexter** and **Prison Break**.

For political wheeling and dealing, watch **House of Cards**, **Brotherhood**, or to a lesser extent, **Boardwalk Empire**.

For dramatic (if somewhat melodramatic) historical fiction, try **Vikings**, **The Tudors** or **The Borgias**. Each is a bit more soap-opera-y than the last, though.

For a HBO-typical focus on combining sex and gore with a fantasy story, try the first few seasons of **True Blood**.

If you don't mind a more episodic approach to an overarching story line, try **Carnivale** or **Babylon 5**.

If you don't mind foreign series, for a high production value (if slightly dodgy in dialogue and acting) epic, try the Chinese **Three Kingdoms**.

If you don't mind anime, try **Fullmetal Alchemist** or **Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood** for something sweeping (both are overlapping but independent takes on the same story, and arguing the merits of one over the other remains flame-bait to this day). For plots within plots, try **Death Note** (and if you like it and want more, give **Code Geass** a go). For medieval fantasy, try **Berserk**. For horror/war themes, try **Attack on Titan**. And, hey, if you find an anime series you like and want to find something similar, /r/animesuggest is active and just a click away.

.

So, a subjectively ranked list of ""likeliness to enjoy, given you enjoyed GoT/BB/TWD"":

# The Wire
# Rome
# Oz
# The Sopranos
# Battlestar Galactica
# House of Cards
# Heroes (season 1)
# Prison Break (first season or two)
# Fullmetal Alchemist/FMA:Brotherhood
# Vikings
# Carnivale
# Brotherhood
# Boardwalk Empire
# Berserk
# Death Note
# Attack on Titan
# Dexter (first few seasons)

kempff,linguistics,1389601604.0,"When I am under certain kinds of psychological stress, I am unable to speak the names of everyday objects. I have learned to work around this by talking around the name of something, describing it in the style of a definition. While I am in a state of psychological halt over the name of something, I have a crystal clear image of it in my mind, so I describe or define the thing whose name I am unable to speak.

Hence I rely on quirky circumlocutions. ""The machine that washes dishes"" is dishwasher, ""out beyond the edge of the city"" is in the suburbs, ""edge of the water"" is a lake shore, ""edge of the land"" is an ocean beach, ""book of days"" is an appointment calendar, ""flat place"" is a tabletop or countertop, ""hand insulator"" is a hot pad; ""car"" is anything on wheels and can be a truck, ""van"" is a nonpowered car that can be pulled, ""house"" is a place where someone lives and can be a 10th floor studio apartment downtown, ""communicator"" is a cell phone. ""Where is my I write with it?"" means Where is my pen?; ""I need an I cut with it"" means I need a chef's knife. I don't mean to belabor the point; I'm just illustrating the pervasiveness of my problem.

On the positive side, I am unbeatable at the game Taboo (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo_%28game%29). I can get someone to guess the word ""bagel"" without using the words doughnut, bread, hole, Jewish or cream cheese. I'd probably circumlocute ""edible innertube that comes in cinnamon-raisin"".

Possibly related is the fact that I an *extremely* visual. I couldn't make heads or tails out of algebra until someone drew me a diagram. I am able to do 3-dimensional geometry in my head - did you know that an oblique section of a cylinder is an ellipse whose foci are the points of tangency of spheres with the same radius as the cylinder? I can prove it too, because I can see it in my mind.

In fine, I am not sure what the problem is. Maybe it's the sheer intensity of my ability to visualize that is overwhelming my ability to come up with the names of things. Or maybe names, insofar as they are mere words and not things in their own right, are of negligible consequence to my mind!

EDIT: Just nouns. I have no trouble with any other part of speech.

Push the wave into tower, take the wave behind the tower, go into their jungle, take their camps, gank mid etc. That's one of the main reasons why top lane picks such as Shyvana and Rengar are so popular right now. They have tons of mobility, can rush half over the map and be back at top before the minions hit your tower. Darius can't, he lacks the mobility, hence why he's not picked much anymore. Nowadays it's all about mobility.

With Darius your best bet would probably be to take the towers as fast as possible. Ward their jungle entrances so you can safely push up to the second tower and just put as much pressure as possible on top lane. Force their jungler and mid laner to respond to you, giving your teammates some time to breath. A fed Darius can 1v2 quite often, use this advantage! If all of your teammates are losing however, you're probably not going to win the game. A Darius can't put as much pressure on the enemy as a Mundo, Shyvana and Rengar can."

There is no other investment available that you can live in rent free, that you can leverage this much, that has nearly no risk of capital loss over the long term, and that the government will give you a tax break to own.  When these things are factored in, homeownership starts to make financial sense.  

Homeowners generally enjoy owning their homes, too; many feel free to customize it just as they want to, and that has some kind of value that's hard to put a price tag on."

I read a book that really changed my perspective, and 23 is the perfect age to read it.  It's called *[Cosmic Trigger: Final Secrets of the Illuminati](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Trigger-Final-Secret-Illuminati/dp/1561840033/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389601380&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=cosmic+trigger)* by Robert Anton Wilson.

On one level, it's a book that asks the question ""Are aliens from the planet Sirius guiding humanity's destiny?""  But the book isn't really about aliens, or I wouldn't recommend it.  It's really about *how we create our own reality*.  It's about how our perceptions of the world around us shape and limit our experiences, and how we can take control of our perceptions and choose the lives we want to live.  It's also *very* funny.

I really think you'd enjoy it, and get a lot out of it.  If you find it interesting, I'd follow up with Wilson's book *Prometheus Rising*, which is sort of a lessonbook for self-improvement."

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389602384.0,"&gt;I'm not blaming women.

You're attempting to link women and their freedom to their lack of safety, as if to say that it is their freedom which generates their risk. That is what we call ""blaming"". 

It is important for you to begin to understand that the lack of safety these women face is *not from being outside*. All societies should deem it important that all people should feel safe, regardless of place time and location. Rather, it is because *there are people who are willing to commit acts of aggression and violence* that safety is a question. 

However, perhaps you are more blaming your idea of ""feminism"" for this than women themselves. 

&gt; I'm saying from everything I have witnessed and read and studied up on it makes no sense to put a petite women or a man or women who is frail outside is kind of irresponsible. Which they do.

This statement is fallacious. Just because you have experienced something does not mean that your experiences can justify particular courses for action. We as humans must compare and contrast our experiences with others to find the proper answers. From there we can find a certain course of action.

Besides, you are ignoring other issues, such as the fact that Walmart's employee policies probably have little to nothing to do with feminism.

&gt;I am not really stuck on this issue anymore.

But you're still here.

&gt;Whatever is right or wrong about it I've given up on understanding.

I don't think you ever cared to understand. It seems pretty clear reading your original post.

&gt;I'm trying to understand feminism now and so far it's gotten me know where.

You might want to try reading the side bar before posting next time. ""Trying to understand"" and blaming feminism what you see as a problem are not one in the same.

&gt;Some things are good, some things are silly, and others are just plain complaining because life is a little too hard.

This is what we call a ""straw[person]"" fallacy here on reddit.

&gt;Maybe someday I will understand but no one has bothered to give me a full layout of things.

It's no one's responsibility to give you a ""full layout of things"" nor should that be a prerequisite to your full understanding of feminism. There are plenty of works out there and you have the power and ability to lurk more, read the side bar, and visit the other feminism related subs. It's disingenuous of you to come in here and whine about not being able to understand feminism when there is so much reading material plastered all over this sub."

I don't have any statistics at all for females, and they are often underreported anyways. I'm not sure what the stats look like for female molesters and whether or not they are more likely to molest both genders or just one.

In any case, I stand by my argument that somebody who has molested a child of one sex is *more* likely to molest a child of the other sex than somebody who has never molested a child.

I'm not saying she has a particularly high chance of molesting her daughter or niece or whatever, I'm just saying that if I were taking odds on it, I would have to consider her chances higher than an average adult female, because I already have information that age doesn't really matter to her.

If you just flat-out don't want to go alone, as I didn't, I'd suggest going on fetlife to look for someone to go with. That's what I did, and it worked out great. Message unattached women in your area (there will be some in the Bay Area, great thing about a big city) and explain the situation, and ask if they'd mind going to a munch together. Offer to drive or whatever. Make sure you are clear that you aren't asking them to play with you, and won't pressure them to play once you're together, but rather that you're just looking for friends. Then actually follow through with that plan and just be friendly and cool. The people you have mutual attraction with will find their way to you."

All but one of the players rarely came to class and missed some exams. When they did take exams it was obvious the players were nowhere near college level education (their answers read about 3rd grade level). I ended up flunking four of the five, with one sending me constant emails about how unfair it was, since he was going to lose his eligibility to play. After speaking it over with my professor, he offered a one time only make up exam (that was only offered to the players). None showed.

The Wind Wall is a fun concept but also gives him tons of tankyness for free, without any payoff at all.

1. Wiccans are pagans and they have quite a few practices and rituals. You will find more information on their beliefs in /r/Wicca no doubt. 

2. All of the above. Me, personally, I feel ""drawn"" to certain gods by actually taking the time and reading about them. The more I'm drawn to a specific god, the more I read about them. If what I read appeals to me, I might do some meditating to see whether or not I feel drawn to follow that god as an actual follower, or if I am merely interested in some of that god's attributes. This is specifically what *I* do. Other people will do other things. 

3. Yes and no. Some pagans have more ritualized and hierarchical faiths. They can be as intricate as a full Druid priesthood, or as casual as a hedge witch having soul cakes on Samhain with some friends. 

There are many faiths under the umbrella of ""pagan"". They're all going to be different, and they all have their own rules. "

If you have the skills and capital to buy cheap, fix up and then sell for more, maybe that's an investment - or if you can do rentals and make more than the mortgage, taxes and insurance.

Having a gay or bisexual guy about to spring forth from an otherwise straight married man while he doesn't know it himself would be a large part of any plot. When I first started writing, I would've had an inner dialogue where he thinks, 'gosh, I think I might be gay!' Now I realise the wonderful enjoyment of doing nothing of the sort and playing around instead with words or having him (*horribly* crude example here) thinking about something completely innocent whilst gripping onto a banana.

Perhaps his wife could complain about his preference for doggy style and avoidance of missionary. I tend to write a lot of comedy and the set-up you describe is great for farce and misunderstanding, so forgive my blunt examples. The key question is whether or not the reader needs to know about his sexuality too, as that leaves even greater scope for scattering subtle clues throughout the story if it's a secret to everyone, such as driving home from work and flicking the radio off from the news and settling on a showtune from West Side Story or something.

1kachan,Libertarian,1389604530.0,"Canadian here, so my predictions will be primarily based on Canada and the World as opposed to the US and the World. 

**Politics**

The Canadian political landscape has experienced a right-ward shift since the mainstream right-wing parties merged, and I think that shift will continue. As the centre moves closer and closer to the economic right, so too will the leftmost mainstream parties. 

While economically the country will continue to move to the right, Canada will remain socially progressive with an expansive welfare state. Universal health care will continue to be a top value for Canadians. 

I do not see Libertarianism ever being a dominant force in Canadian politics, however if we experience a electoral reform which brings about proportional representation, we may see an increase in libertarians in our House of Commons.

**Trade**

Historically Canada's largest trading partners were first the United Kingdom, and later and continuously since the Unites States of America. While I think Canada and the US will remain close economically, I think Canada will diversify its trading with other countries for a series of reasons such as: 

- Emerging Eastern Markets (China, India) 
- A new free-trade pact recently made with the EU
- Developing markets outside of the East (i.e. South America)

If I have learned anything, it is that addiction has multiple victims. Your life can get wrapped up in his problems. You don't want to be an enabler in any way. I might have made him change his number with me by his side. It sounds like he is taking responsibility however, so you are probably okay helping him. But if it any time, you find yourself trying to support him more than what is comfortable (i.e. you can no longer take care of yourself), that has to stop. 

Are you able to go with him to a Narcanon group? Could you attend an Alanon group by yourself? I attended just two Alanon groups and I got a lot out of that. It's amazing what being around people who are openly expressing the battle they are going through can do. There is so much stigma around addiction that people like your brother try to quit and then fail, but don't talk to people in similar situations. They keep all those feelings bottled up.

I am just going to repeat that Alanon was amazingly good for me. I broke down crying in the first meeting. I felt so alone for so long. I felt like I was the good kid too, and I didn't have anyone paying attention to my needs. It was all about my sister for more than 10 years. My sister's addiction was pretty severe.

I agree that its not as benefical for those countries with outside links, the issue however is the UK should be getting a tighter economical links with Europe, as great as the outside links are, they will suffer problems, ie Australia wanted to get closer trade with China, South Africa getting into a closer trade links with the African Union. Without the additional strength of the European trading bloc to help the UK, it will have problems competing with other countries if they themselves are getting into trading bloc's, which we can see happening at the moment.
Of course we can't trade everything we have in Europe, it makes sense to diversify the trade, and a more tightly united Europe will still need to trade outside of it, why not take advantage of one of its states membership in the Commonwealth?

While I agree that no country should be forced to enclose itself within a tighter union, if it voted not to, ultimately the tyranny of the majority is something that would be needed to be looked at in a integrated union, at the moment, the individual states are the ones whom decide if they agree with what the EU parliament has said, and many of its laws have been sensible, even good hearted, such as its green laws and pushed to reduce smoking.

I will just say that I believe more languages allows a greater diversity of culture, while giving problems with integration, I see this eventually being sorted by technology

Much of the recession can be blamed on individuals, short-term thinking and greed of a minority. The bureaucracy cannot be blamed for halting something as massive as a recession that large.
I feel that its something that needs reform, but there is no political will in which to do it at the moment.

Its difficult not to see the interconnectedness of the world, when a T-shirt is designed in Europe, the cotton is made in South America, sent to India/China, spun and created, sent and then sold in the USA, that is the craziness of our world. No country (arguably with the exception of North Korea) in the world can stand and say I stand alone, I do lean on anyone. Every country moves trade and goods around, the only reason the Asian tigers did so well was with western early investment (UK - HK, USA-South Korea/Singapore) gave them a heads start as part of the development was giving them markets which would buy and sell their goods, giving basic agreement to the advances of a close working relationship :)

My example above gives the difference between theoretical Independance and actual Independence. Norway wanting to only have the good parts of the EU isn't able to have a say if they do something against her best interested, such as voting against whaling and not providing a market for her whales, because of this Norway does not have as much of a market to sale any whales she catches, reducing there value. This is opposed to the UK where we have a vote (and a pretty strong one at that, due to our economy) on what the EU says, thus providing us with the ability to do more of what we want.

My ex would see that I had a bad day, and would come out wearing a leather skirt and boots, and a bag of gummy bears. It was simple, thoughtful, and completely changed my mood. When I saw that she was having a bad day, I would break open a bottle of wine and put on Nine Inch Nails.

TryUsingScience,kickstarter,1389604782.0,"You can't get in touch with the manufacturers yourself? You can message other people with similar projects and ask them what they did if you're not sure where to start.

You definitely need to know your total costs before setting a goal. What is the smallest production run you can reasonably do? How much will that cost? How much will it cost to ship all those things to the backers? Add those numbers, add any other costs you can think of, add a margin of error, add 10% or so for fees, and that's your goal.

But another thing you need for a Kickstarter is a sort of go-getting DIY attitude. You're not a big company; you're just you. Backers get that and don't expect you to be perfect, but they also don't expect you to waste their money. They'd rather you post an update about how you spent five hours on the phone with the manufacturer than an update about how you spent $1k on a consultant to talk to the manufacturer for you.

I have to admit I'd be wary of backing a project that listed a consultant under expenses unless it explicitly spelled out why that was the best and cheapest way to do things. I'd assume the creator didn't know what they were doing and wasn't personally invested enough to figure it out themself."

Sometimes I feel like our new logo seems reminiscent of some of the NFL logos - the big, bold cannon and colours stand out and the font is big as well. Quite appealing to the American consumer. 

Fair play.

Alphadestrious,TheRedPill,1389605921.0,"1. Hit the gym, start dieting right, become more active. I've been working out for a little over 3 years with amazing progress and trust me the chicks love it, especially ass.

2. Join toastmasters to enchance your public speaking and communication skills. Conquer fears and you will build momentum to become even more successful. I must emphasize getting out of your comfort zone no matter how awkward it is, just learn to basket in awkwardness because it will happen. Travel the world too while you're at it and learn about different cultures and the beautiful women our planet has to offer.

3. Join organizations to network and meet people that more align to your beliefs and stuff. www.meetup.com

4. Try new things, become well rounded, understand schools of thought and concepts of philosophy, and humble yourself with astronomy as there are far bigger things than our tiny planet. /r/space /r/spaceengine

5. Read Robert Greene books and other books which can help you in life.

6. Having a soldiers menality, we are all here to help each other and become ballers. /r/getmotived

7. Read seduction and pickup books, grab certain ideas and things to use (although I must admit some of it is 
bullshit) from Mark Manson, Dr. Love, The Game (outdated though) Love Systems, and various schools of thought within the pick-up community. I'm no professional pick up artist but some of this shit really works. /r/seduction

8. Work on your fashion /r/malefashionadvice

9. Try to read into finance and investments, I love doing that on my spare time and feel empowered knowing certain things the average Joe probably doesn't know like true APR rate, securities, etc. I even have some investments myself and have some Vanguard ETFs, even Monster since I love their energy drinks.

10. Do all of this for your better future self; think in that mindset. Learn to be a cool-ass guy that gets it when it comes to social interactions.

11. Being a bad-ass, baller, alpha is a mindset which must be practiced and remember that will-power is also a muscle, albeit a mental one. Work on yourself phyiscally, career-wise, mentally, and spiritually.

12. Read into different religions and understand different view points. I'm not a Christian or anything but I do believe there is a higher power which permeates the universe and is FAR greater than ourselves. 

13. Start listening to music which promotes being bad ass at life like some rap music (Gucci Mane, Waka Flocka, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Sky Lexington, etc.) /r/hiphopheads  I must say this music is very superficial but it gets me in that mindset to grind. I'm a musician so I love all types of music I respect artists who have come before us like Herbie Hancock (HeadHunters), Cortex (amazing jazz band that is sampled a lot by rappers) but trap music brings out an edge to me.

14. As you start building your circle surround yourself with positive, successful people who will motivate you by actions and words. 

15. Start reading into world news, politics, and economics to see how the world is doing. Yes some parts of the world and some things are horrible but there are good people who live with a purpose and desire to help those and give back to the community. However, be careful with politics though it can get you sucked in. Personally I'm a political atheist that doesn't believe in political parties (although they do have influence) and believe corporate money is destroying our political system along with first past the post voting, and I tend to align towards the independent route which encourges voting on well informed decisions. /r/economics /r/politics 
/r/worldnews http://www.politifact.com/

16. Learn a new language or try to expand your vocabulary spending 10 minutes a day or something. Just become a better person and well-rounded as well as focusing on your career as a backbone. We are here for you bro, improve yourself and the women will come. 

17. Just have a roadmap or plan that you want to achieve and just do it. I'm graduating this semester from college and my roadmap is to continue working on myself and go for my MBA, all thanks to motivating people around me and all the organizations and fraternities I'm in. 

18. Don't compare yourself to anyone and just focus on yourself, ain't nothing gonna be accomplished by comparing yourself. Just be the best you can and sometimes being the best you can isn't enough and that's okay. Just be mentally strong and plow through shit life throw's at you like a baws. Think of basketball, the best shooters shoot between 40 and 50 percent so if you become good you can get that percentage and maybe even higher with hours of interactions and noticing patterns. However, we can never shoot 100 percent and there isn't enough time to be the best at everything, so just pound the rock. 

19. Remember, take a step at a time and constantly improve little by little. It is not the last strike which shatters the rock but the thousands that came before it. Good luck bro. Hope this helped. "

I do feel as though the EU is given more of the blame than is fair, especially considering how little power it realistically has.

In regards to contribution towards NATO, with the majority of countries within it, its hardly fair to say they don't contribute enough when the USA is willing to spend SO much on defense, I mean really? who is the US fighting? farmers in Afghanistan, that definitely requires the use of a cutting edge fighter aircraft. Also the US didn't seem to mind during the cold war building its missile sites in NATO countries, suddenly making countries like Turkey a nuclear target.
Besides if your a smaller country in Europe and the only superpower is willing to say, I will help you if you get attacked, no questions asked, you'd definitely feel safe enough to reduce spending on defense, ignoring the fact there is nobody in Europe anyone has to be afraid of that they might get invaded.

Yes Europe complains about refugees, but we still take them.

Overall however I do agree with out that the large potential impact of a strong united EU is lost on the average voter, and if I want the dream of a united EU its going to take some serious education and a lot of holds to fix but I still believe its the right thing to do"

silverionmox,europe,1389606467.0,"&gt;I'd prefer New Zealand-Chinese type deals where they are simply phasing out all trade tariffs.

Tariffs are but a fraction of the trade barriers that China imposes.

&gt;We'd be outside and able to

Able to doesn't mean that it's going to happen.

&gt;It would also mean being able to drastically reduce the annual 0.7% of GDP to foreign aid - many of these recipients actually benefiting more from trade than aid.

Almost nobody achieves that percentage. It's not enforced, you can and are doing that already.

&gt;It's by far the simplest, most streamlined approach with less administration and global protectionism.

... eventually, if your promises come true. Until then you'd still have n² treaties to deal with, where n is the number of countries. The EU *effectively* did dispose of all the bilateral trade treaties *already*. Not a far future promise, a fact.

&gt;It's also far easier to make deals 1:1 than it is finding a consensus 28:1, and with all the concessions and compromises that brings. We would have had trade deals with the likes of India, Canada, China, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, US, long ago.

And you would have a different trade treaty with all of these, putting a huge administrative burden on your export economy.

&gt;Even little Iceland and Switzerland are moving faster in making new deals than what the EU is trying to placate 28 members.

They're starting from less - they're mostly catching up.

&gt;The EU primarily serves corporate interests

Free trade primarily serves corporate interests to start with.

&gt;We're simply not indicative in our manufacturing, financial services, cultural exports as broad swathes of the EU members (especially those in the Med/Eastern Europe).

And yet you want free trade with everyone... 

&gt;The trade agreement talks are also a lot more transparent and accountable compared to the EU, 

A very, very vague statement.

&gt;which are positively clandestine in that they're sneaking ACTA and IP in through a side door, circumventing democracy.

As if they wouldn't be trying to do that in bilateral trade treaties. It's even easier to sneak it in there... if the biggest country of the two isn't simply dictating that ACTA-like legislation has to be included in the treaty."

silverionmox,Economics,1389607010.0,"&gt; ""Peak"" is disengenous when the differences are not that major.

Not major? The minimum wage now is barely 67% of the peak value. How is losing 1/3 of your real wage while the economy is growing a minor difference?

&gt;Is this surprising to you?
The need for low skill labor goes down as technological progress makes things more efficient and reduces the need for that labor. Minimum wage jobs are by definition the lowest skilled, or rather, have more people with those skills than any others.

It means that ""trickle down economy"" and ""rising tides lifing all boats"" quips are just bullshit. Without redistribution, only the rich get richer.

&gt;The real question is why more hasn't been done to increase the skills of millions of people who are left behind in that movement.

Mostly because ""taxes are communist"" and the market doesn't invest in people.

&gt;If you're relying on minimum wage increases to raise peoples wages then you're failing those people as you're expecting them to only have skills that are only worth paying the legal minimum for. We need an economy that trains up people to have skills that are actually worth something more than the least you can pay.

And making them to work three jobs of stacking shelves just to pay the bills is the surest way to prevent them from educating themselves.

&gt;Unfortunately the modern political system has no interest in reforming the education to provide people with economically valuable skills.

The market changes too fast, educational choices are made half a decade beforehand. Companies aren't willing to invest in employees. 

The problem is that productivity already is so high that we can easily produce the basics of living already. The economy has no use for so much labour. Letting the wage drop isn't going to change that - and it would slow down technological innovation to boot."

I don't really think Jose does that, or at least, no more than any other coach. He's rotated relentlessly and hasn't hesitated to bench someone if he feels the aren't doing well enough. He even benched Hazard for pissing him off that one time and he's the best player on the team.

Its just that once we started opening things up to try to catch up, the wheels came off.  But if we can limit mistakes and not let the Seahawks run up a lead on us... we have the defense to shut them down.  And we have the offense to score some points.

ElderKingpin,gainit,1389607511.0,"Get yourself a pull-up bar, get two towels, and then a backpack for your 15 lb dumbbell or heavier if you want to.

/r/bodyweightfitness

I'm gonna lay this out and while talking about your current routine a bit.

* Stop doing so many sit ups and crunches

Replace your sit ups and push ups with skill training, so things like [L-sits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUZJoSP66HI), planks, and planche progressions. It'll probably suck to begin with but the skill work effectively works your core a lot better than tons of crunches/sit ups will do. When (get one) you get a pull-up bar, do pull-ups while doing L-sits, BOOM, double compound exercises. Massive gains.

* Split up your workout into multiple days and use variations for different days

Ok so I'm not given a lot of info but I'm guessing that you're doing all 5 of those exercises every time you workout. You'll most likely burn out and to be honest your intensity isn't that great. Drop your reps by adding weights and doing variations, I'll lay out some of the variations here.

1\. Squat/lower body variations:

Regular squats with weights (go deep, make sure your form is IMPECCABLE because your weight is so light)

One legged squats, get a chair or a box, put one of your legs on the object and then do squats that way.

Pistol squats, you've probably heard of these, put one leg out and then squat down and then come back up, you'll most likely need to use a bar or something to support you if this is your first experience with pistol squats. 

Lunges, again with your weighted backpack, do lunges, make sure you step forward enough to feel a stretch and make sure your form is correct, draw a line between your two legs and your feet should not cross the line as you're doing the lunges. Keep it slow as lunges are mostly a stretching exercise to help you go deeper with your hamstrings/hip area.

2\. Upper body variations/progressions

Regular pull-ups, put the dumbbell in the backpack and then do it like that. When you're doing pull-ups first get to 20 reps (IMO, it can be whatever number you want) of regular pull-ups without trouble. And then move your reps down by adding weights or doing one armed pull-ups, there are progressions on how to do that. The most common way is a negative where you jump up and then lower yourself with one arm.

Push ups, once again, keep your push up rep relatively low, you're doing everything at home so you're trying to simulate gym weights when you don't have gym weights. I've tried putting weights into a backpack and doing pushups but the weight keeps falling off my back as I'm doing it so. Move your grip in more and slow down your movement. Once you've done that, do one armed push up progressions, which means go to a staircase or get an object that is as tall as one step on the staircase, put one arm on the object and use the other arm to do your push up, the wider your legs are the easier it'll be.

Rows, so this is some grip training for you, also beneficial /r/griptraining. Hang your two towels from your pull-up bar, grab those towels, and do inverted rows with those. Super effective, make sure your movement is slow and you are focusing on the intended muscles.

[Handstand push ups](http://www.beastskills.com/handstand-pushups-beginner/), get up next to a wall, and do push ups like that. This is going to be your main bodyweight trap exercise. It's gonna be super hard if you haven't done it before but there are progressions that you can do, and its a great skill to have and it has a lot of pay off. Face the wall when you're doing your progressions, and don't flare your elbows, your elbows should be going in towards the wall when you're doing it.

Generally I stay away from isolation exercises like simple curls because you can get the same effectiveness by doing a compound exercise with the added benefit of working another muscle group.

* Your workout is mostly gonna be bodyweight, so be honest with yourself and keep it intense

The thing about bodyweight exercises is that you have to tell yourself that if you want more gains you're gonna want to force yourself to purposely put your body at a disadvantage so that you don't stagnant. If the exercise seems too easy, it probably is, keep the reps low and make sure you're at least suffering a little. 

* Do skill work and stretch on your off-days, its good for you.

Learn to do things like splits and work towards a planche on your off days, flexibility is something that's looked over until you figure out that it's pretty crummy to not be flexible or be stiff. Bodyweight exercises benefit a lot from having good mobility, in fact even in the gym good mobility will always be a benefit to you. Remember to warm up and and cool down with stretches. 

* Figure out a workout that works for you, there are more variations than what I've told you and its up to your to develop the best workout for yourself because I'm not you and you're not me, what works for you will take weeks or maybe months to figure out. Keep it fresh and rotate the exercise order as well.

I'm probably forgetting things but that is the most of it. Good luck, and beef up.

From my flair you can see that I've gained +/- 16 or so pounds since I started eating more, you can go very far with bodyweight exercises, you'll never be as big as someone who has massive weights at their disposal but you'll most likely be more flexible and have skills that you have acquired from your bodyweight workouts."

IndependentBoof,skeptic,1389607675.0,"There's really a couple explanations:

**Brain plasticity.**

The connections between neurons will change forming new pathways based on your physiological behavior. For example, (to put it generally) if your eyes are not sending your brain any signals, the neurons that would have been used for processing sight will be re-purposed. 

**Cognitive load**

We have limits to how much stimuli we can process and attend to. For example, you may drive attentively (using your sight and hearing). Then someone in the car starts talking to you. You have to use some of those cognitive resources to listen to what they say. Then, your bored kids start playing a game with all sorts of buzzers and flashing lights. These all produce stimuli that compete for your cognitive resources. When you're overburdened with stimuli and things to think about you will not be able to process them all with the same aptitude. Consequently, doing something that will block out extra stimuli will allow you to use your cognitive resources for your intended task."

p3ndulum,poker,1389607734.0,"Everything about poker is situational, so there's no real finite answers to questions like ""should I 3-bet more?""

What you should be trying to do is develop your ability to process information, as well as project future outcomes.

How you should play any specific hand is relative to things like what position you are in, who you expect to be playing against and what their tendencies are, how deep the stack sizes are and your own image, among other things.

You should be less worried about such specific details like how often you are 4-betting and more concerned about things like ""what is the best decision in *this moment*?""

Try to avoid falling into the trap of playing your hands on auto-pilot, thinking that because a specific hand looks strong you should play it aggressively from start to finish, or that because a certain hand is weak that you should play it more passively. Instead, start thinking about things like how you are going to figure out what it is exactly you're up against; or how you might be able to win the pot even when your hand doesn't improve and still make it look credible.

You should be thinking about things like what you are going to do on the next street if your raise gets called on the current street, whether that next card helps you or hurts you.

You should be thinking about things like how to decieve your opponents and how you are going to build the pot after making a strong hand.

Work on thinking 2-3 streets and decisions ahead of your opponents and how to be creative with your lines so that you're not givin too much information about your hand away until it's too late to your opponent.

Work on being the one who has the most control over the size of the pot, whether you are in position or out of position.

Think every decision, every possible angle and outcome through before committing to an action.

Before folding, think about whether or not it would be believable if you put in a raise. Before calling, think about what that might lead your opponent to believe about what cards you are holding.

If you focus too much on the numbers, your game becomes robotic, predictable and easily exploitable. But if you focus on making the best possible decision in every moment if every hand you play, you should begin to see a *reflection* of that in the numbers."

Anyone saying this is not very good at science, to put it in a really terribly layman way of speaking. Scientists and those in the scientific community are constantly at odds with each other over what seems to be the answer. Both sides can have convincing evidence, but if their convincing evidence leads to two different conclusions, then they'll either bicker and argue like Protestants and Catholics or they'll put their heads together and work it out like scientists.

The_Fart_Of_God,leagueoflegends,1389608456.0,"always stay at the level of your adc :

* don't go too far forward in the lane or you'll get bursted and your adc won't be able to react

* don't stay too far back, you need to show presence so that your adc can farm without being punished.

this allows you to always fight as two.

Harass the enemy adc with a little poke when he goes in to last hit. Don't allin unless you're sure you get the kill.

Ward the bottom bushes and camp them as much as possible. Use red trinket to remove their vision and zone them out of cs.

Always have an eye on the minimap and watchout for any change in your lane opponent behaviour (if they suddenly get more aggressive the jungle might not be far).

Know your damage and the damage your opponent can dish out. Know if you win trade or lose them. This takes a few games to really get all matchups possibilities. Against the lanes where you will win trades, be aggressive and tell your adc. Against the lanes where you will lose trades be more passive and tell your adc to only last hit (freeze). Most adc won't listen in solo queue but it never hurts to try.

always always always be the bodyguard. This is your role. Use your skills to protect your adc over everything. It's called peeling. Don't leave your adc on his own, he'll get killed and you'll lose so much team dps. Your mission is to protect him, to carry him so he can carry all of you.

Sometimes you feel like you can engage and go ham (example with leona you ult + e + q). If the enemy has been caught alone this is very good and will result in a nice advantage. If the enemy is sticking together as 5 you just lost your adc so I hope this engage was worth it.

My preference is to leave the engage to other teammates and to use my spells as counter engages / peel.

Be aware of your level and the power spikes you get from them. Leona gets really strong lvl3, lulu is already very very strong lvl2, blitz can grab you lvl1. From this knowledge you can start to understand when to push (kill more creeps fast using skills) to get closer to your level up, and when to freeze (only last hit, and present a damage threat to your opponents).

This style of play work really nicely with lulu, tresh and janna who are amazing at peeling.

Supports like annie, blitz, leona and even sona with her ult are more about catching people and making plays, less about defending your adc (even though they can, sort of).

In teamfights don't stay at the front line and analyze what the opponent team can do. If they don't have huge aoe burst/cc (orianna/malphite/wukong) stay close together and fight as a 5 man juggernaut all the way through the nexus, if they do try to organize your team into catching out your opponents, and don't fight in tight areas like the jungle. You do that by outwarding the enemy team, and using the red trinket to remove their vision.

if your adc sucks, tell him it's ok to lose the bot turret, the tell him to freeze the lane at the second turret and to never engage, just farm. In the meantime go roam and carry someone else like your mid. This is easier with playmaker supports.

tl;dr : against highly aggressive teams : pick a peel support, against other teams pick a playmaker support.

Best feeling when ending a game is having the enemy team /allchat : report this botlane. You know you did good."

bubbish,AskMen,1389608535.0,"I was with a girl in France. Everything was good until she tried to shove a baguette up my ass. Took my clothes and ran away. I couldn't eat cream cheese sandwiches for weeks after that.

Hooked up with a guy in Thailand. Turned out it was a girl. Imagine my surprise and delight when she took her clothes off!

This one time I was in Australia and met a girl who could only get off if I nailed her while she was hanging upside down. That was tricky. And weirdly hot.

Probably my weirdest experience was with a Mongolian villager who had mastered the art of throat singing. Best. Blowjob. Ever.

I've also slept with an Inuit. First she had me dip my cock in an ice fishing hole. She said if I caught any fish I could have her. I caught two. She gave it to me so hard that night, her igloo started melting.

Iceland was nice. Met a local brunette at the hotel and she took me to a hot natural spring. It was very warm and cozy, and I was lucky because I had stuffed my face with fermented Icelandish burritos that night and was extremely gassy but the bubbling water gave me the perfect cover.

The upside to this I guess is that he's the same height I am, and has more clothes than he knows himself. So the mother and my SO often just give me some of his clothes that he'll never miss or realize he ever had to begin with. So, yay, free clothes.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389608744.0,"Generalizing are the people who attack EU immigration as they only pick up things from this which they like. For example, ""1.5mln immigrants from just Eastern Europe came to UK"" - oh sorry, we forgot about some facts, like it was actually 1.3 (something around that) and that from those remained in the country somewhat 700-800k and that this number is a total of 1-1.5% of total UK population. Even recent 40k Polish children taking CHB.... yeah, that may not be fully fair but 48k out of 8mln CHB is basically nothing.

Unfortunately those who use immigration as the main reason to quit EU are the ones who don't have any valid points.

Tell me, how many of average Brits actually know an immigrant from EE? And I'm not talking London people. I bet most of the British population ""met"" someone from there by seeing him in the shop or hearing about him from a friend. How the hell most of Brits are then directly impacted by the immigration?

UKIP does dirty tactics. Dirty tactics is talking ""facts"" which are made up. Ignoring reports which are pretty scientific. Talking about quitting EU just because EU immigration but at the same time adding numbers from outside EU immigration. Talking about ""benefit tourism"" where NO SINGLE report regarding this exists. UK can obviously have a serious discussion about immigration but most of the recent one is way from being serious and UKIP leads the way in it, telling people what they want to hear as it's only convenient for them."

The vast majority of anti-socialists simply stand against (to say demonize makes it sound like we hate free speech or that we hate those who disagree with ours) the idea of forced sharing.

Besides, we already have socialized healthcare, it's called insurance and if you can't afford it, you're either permanently disabled and can never help the pack (pay it back) OR you refused to join the pack, as I did.

I do however think that everyone that doesn't have awesome medical insurance should learn a lot of medical skills. If you can't tie a tourniquet, cauterize a wound in a shitty situation, supply CPR, clear an infection, dress/clean a wound all to yourself (except the CPR) you really just aren't qual. to go w/o insurance.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,skeptic,1389608824.0,"she is actually correct (sort of), but i think you misunderstand the context and to what degree.

Basically your Metabolic rate does fluctuate and the body has a set of priorities of functions it can expend on or not based on its calorific intake.

so for example if you reduced your intake significantly for a couple of days, your body would likely not maintain bone density for that period as it normally would to ""save"" calories. and maintain bone density when calories are plentiful.

Basically if you expect your Metabolism to be a consistent 2000 calories a day and anything over it will add weight and anything under it will lose weight at a rate of 3500 calories per lb of fat, you will be disappointed.

your body is a highly evolved survival machine, calories are its life blood and so it really will alter its functions and processes to hang on to as many calories and survive for as long as it can.

but extreme calories deficit over an extended period will indeed result in weight loss, as is its function of stored energy specifically for that purpose.

Dont forget that under normal conditions we existed being relatively close to starvation (compared to now) and our bodies really do try and hold onto fat and energy as a matter of survival."

alexhamiltonishot,AdviceAnimals,1389609081.0,"If they noticed it, they should have mentioned it. 
1) They only had the map until Ron's 3rd year at Hogwarts. So if they had the map and noticed it then Ron would have been as young as 11 or as old as 13.

2) They could have known who Peter Pettigrew was had they known recent wizarding history. In which case they should definitely have told someone that an old guy everyone thought was dead was sleeping with their little brother.

3) If we assume they don't know who Peter Pettigrew is, they still should be suspicious. Hogwarts is small enough that they should have known (at least by name) everyone in their grade, the grade beneath them, and the grade above them. They wouldn't have known or recognized the name Peter Pettigrew so that would mean he is at least 3 years older than Ron. Furthermore, it's very hard (though I imagine it may be possible) to sneak into another house. This makes it likely that the person Ron was sleeping with is in Gryffindor. The twin are quite sociable so they should know all the Gryffindors in most of the grades unless they were much higher grade than them, so Peter Pettigrew could be reasonably assumed to be far older than the twins and even more older than Ron. So, dependng on when they noticed, Peter Pettigrew would have to be at least 14 (though probably older) and sleeping with an 11 year-old-boy, or  16+ and sleeping with a 13 year-old. In my opinion, that's creepy and warrants mentioning.

Imagine this, you're in a school where you know everyone remotely your age when you notice your 12 year old sister is having sex every single night with some unfamiliar guy who is probably much older than her. In this case, I think it would be your responsibility as her brother to figure out who the hell this guy is and make sure he isn't raping her, and maybe talk to your sister about it.

In summary, regardless of their sexual orientation, if you notice that your sibling, who is 13 or even younger, is sleeping with someone, who you assume is more than 3 years older, then that's creepy and you should figure who they are and make sure they're not taking advantage of your little brother.

TL;DR: If you notice your around 12-year-old brother sleeping with a guy you don't know, you should do something."

In contrast, I hate it when I like a girl but she doesn't like me and I find out she likes this other guy and he doesn't like her. It's a vicious cycle and attraction ain't no joke. Seduction is time consuming and at times can be frustrating but just hang in there bro. I'm sure you're a bad ass dude and all we can do is ball hard together.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,skeptic,1389609205.0,"you are correct, however in a complete starvation diet (0 calories) the body does need to breakdown some muscle in order for it to get the essential nutrients it needs to maintain and operate certain systems but obviously for the bulk of energy its entirely Fat stores.

I.e if you start starving, you lose a lot of fat, but also a little muscle,

 lots of people wrongly think you lose muscle first or lose muscle at the same rate. muscle is essential for existence and fat is specifically stored for energy supply, its simply incorrect."

He attributes their wealth to good purchasing decisions, I attribute it to the spectacular success of their business.

My wife and I spent a half hour trying to explain to him that, yes, it's cheaper to buy a $200 drill set in the long run if you're going to end up buying a bunch of cheap shitty $30 drill sets. But you just blew all of your hammer, nails, spanner, screwdriver, clamps and saw budget on that fucking drill set. Good on you. You can now make holes. If a drill suddenly materialises in your hand.

He doesn't understand that you need to be a bit rich in the first place in order to start having access to those efficiencies of quality and quantity. He's right that if you're able to afford good stuff at the start, then you're going to have lower ongoing costs... but I couldn't get it into his head that there's that BIG startup cost to get over.

He works full time on a salary bigger than mine, lives with his parents (well, I understand that he pays an equitable amount of rent) and is 35 and single. I've been supporting a family since literally the day we finished uni together. He has a $2000 tool set next to his small collection of cars and motorbikes.

silverionmox,europe,1389609684.0,"&gt; Who are 'they' ? One man, Papandreou, knowing what was about to happen, proposed the referendum and caved in a few days after. When were the Greeks asked ? Same thing in Italy, Monti is appointed without the people having a say in the matter. 

If those countries aren't having democratic decision processes, how would that improve by removing the EU from the equation?

&gt;that's very doubtful.

I mean beforehand.

&gt;In fact, EU partisans bypass or disregard referendums whenever they can, fearing the peoples' sanction.

Obviously, referendums a sledgehammer: it's okay to use them when it's possible to put the issue as a clear yes/no question. Most of the time, the answer people want to give in a referendum is ""it depends"".

&gt;Another example would be what happened with the European Constituion, refused by the French and the Dutch through referendum, and still ratified with the Lisbon Treaty and parliament vote. It may be legal, but morally forfeit and certainly not legitimate.

Not any less legitimate than creating national laws by national representatives.

&gt;What do those lines have to do with the conversation at all?

While the mishaps around Greece are certainly facepalm-worthy, and probably could have been prevented, we now are in a particular situation and it's a matter of picking lesser evils.

&gt;As we can see by looking at their debt and unemployment rate amongst others...

They used to do the adjustment by cheapening their currency. Now they have to cheapen their wages and products directly. The advantage of the latter is that they only need to do it once. I surely would support measures to make that adjustment less painful.

&gt;Yes it is, and it's also about having monetary policy (inflation, taxes) that suits the needs and the will of your nation, which cannot be pursued with the euro without having major political issues. You can see the higher the EU/USD exchange rate was, the bigger trade deficits were for some (as well as unemployment)

What is so desireable about periodic devaluations? It's a crutch. Too much inflation was widely regarded as a weak spot of the Mediterranean countries. Has that changed?

&gt;The issues happening right now were predicted and the cause is not the drachma PEG in itself, but the irreductible and divergent national interests. Of course economies divergence will appear when you don't have the same fiscal, monetary, wage policies or worker mobility/financial transfers.
The euro not only ignores the differences between the European peoples and their specificity, it also means the end of democracy in order to 'save' it.
The markets attacked the PEG since they know it's bogus, and it will break as all of them did in the history of mankind because to each people its currency.

Economic discrepancies are a side effect of political division, not some fundamental national characteristic.

&gt;the list of supranational currencies that disappeared.

All currencies disappear sooner or later.

&gt;Mario Draghi showed that's not the case by explaining that the different rates asked for credits, granted to euro-area member states, take into account the risk of for the national currencies of Southen Europe to lose value when they leave the EU. If the rates are so high, it is specifically because of the euro. Markets do not trust the PEG. 

That's irrelevant. They would have gotten into economic trouble even when they had their own currencies.

&gt;No euro, no crisis (maybe a different crisis, but not one caused by the euro...)

There is no crisis caused by the euro. The crisis is caused by careless banking. The euro merely changed the toolset available to deal with it. There were two problems with the response:

- the ECB was too slow in taking up its role as a lender of last resort.

- there was too much belief in austerity as a panacea

The first caused the risk premium on the loans of certain countries to get out of hand. The second prevented the state to play its role as a flywheel in times of economic disturbance.

Thanks to the banking union a similar crisis will be much easier to handle in the future. We still need to get away from the bloodletting, but that idea was present in most national governments anyway, that's not just the EU.

duckface08,anime,1389609880.0,"&gt; However, I will say that I usually enjoy the battle Shounen anime (Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, Fairy Tail, Soul Eater, ...) more then the manga (fights in manga are usually meh).

I have to agree with you on this one. It's hard to pick out particular series, but in general, watching a fast-paced battle in its animated form is generally more exciting than panels of still-action in manga (unless, of course, the animation studio ran out of budget, leading to mediocre animation sequences). In fact, I never enjoyed the action in the D.Gray-man manga because it was difficult to follow, but watching the anime pulls it all together and helps it all make sense.

Similarly, any series that deals a lot with music (i.e. Beck) tends to be more enjoyable when animated if only for the soundtrack. Scenes where a character sings a passionate song just doesn't have the same ""oomph"" when you can't hear what they're singing and you're just reading lyrics in a speech bubble."

The bigger cons are [AnimeCon](http://www.animecon.nl/) and [Abunai!](http://www.abunaicon.nl/). They are all 3-days, one is in The Hague and the other is in Eindhoven. AnimeCon is a lot bigger, but for both of them you can count on tickets selling out pretty fast, and hotel rooms sell out even faster, even outside of the convention centre. AnimeCon is in June and Abunai! in August btw.

The smaller cons include [Tsunacon](http://tsunacon.nl/) (one day in Rotterdam), [Nishicon](http://nishicon.nl/) (two days in Zoetermeer) and [Hallyucon](http://www.hallyucon.nl/) (one day in Amsterdam). The last one is a bit special, as it's based on Korean culture instead of Japanese culture. I still think it's worth mentioning cause it sounds pretty cool!

My recommendation? If you want to see the best quality cosplays at the biggest con, go to Animecon. My favourite however is Abunai!, it's always been a bit more laid-back and the hotel rooms are right at the convention site so after-parties (my favourite part of the con haha) are much easier! Tsunacon is my favourite of the smaller cons, it has a very spontaneous staff and a good location. It can get pretty crowded though!"

Me joining UKIP and on the level which I would even be paid by them, with the sole aim of messing things up there AND do it publicly wouldn't work as I would be thrown out of the party. If I did it in silent and only later made some revelations, for example from internal party meetings, I would be called a fucking spy and probably my life would be in danger. Farage does this officially as the level here is more mature and too liberal.

What kind of ""not simple in/out"" Farage needs to decide here? He only advocates for immediate EU departure or have I missed something?

The point here is that if you don't like a sandbox playing group, you just don't join them. Joining them only to show how stupid they are and destroy what they try to achieve is very unfair for that group.

http://espn.go.com/ncaa/revenue

I looked up my home state, Minnesota, and thought: well they make $68 million a year, there's no way they could find a way to spend that much money. Apparently they can, almost. They were spending $63 million on their football program.

Given that these athletes play for super-cheap I have no idea how the Universities end up spending this amount of money. It is absolutely ridiculous and insane.

Edit: Apparently it's all of their athletics, which makes a lot more sense, and is why these costs are so high. I am very certain now that everyone in the Big Ten makes money on their football program, depending on where you categorize their Big Ten contract, which makes probably 60% of its money on Football and 35% on Basketball."

They just gave up their bargaining chip. Now they're at mercy of China, when and if and how it chooses to lift the rest of the barriers.

&gt;That's the name of the game; allowing private businesses of your people to flourish and opening up more markets for them.

And letting your wage levels drop to theirs?

&gt;Scare tactics.

Facts.

&gt;THE UK DOES! That's the point. We all agreed to it at Gleneagles and only the UK has come through. So we're spending 0.7% of our GDP on the understanding other EU countries would do the same and collective shotgun blast the problem. They've reneged and still keep many of these recipients locked out with tariffs decades out of date.
We could kill two birds with one stone. Drop tariffs; redirect 0.7% of GDP.

You already can drop the 0,7%.

&gt;There's virtually nil administrative burden once it's established.

*Please*. Whenever they make a product, companies have to check every single treaty to see whether the product standards conform.

&gt;The rest of the world works like this, and the other continents(!) or major players in the world are improving their world standing decade on decade - or at least holding their own and treading water (US). The EU is slipping.

Vague assertions. They say so little it's impossible to prove or disprove them.

&gt;Bollocks. They have a trade deal with China where the EU is struggling. It's got nothing to do with catchup.

If you cave in to the Chinese dictate, surely you'll get a trade deal soon.

&gt;Depends on the free trade deal.

Bigger entities have much more means to make use of the opportunities.

&gt;Economies not like our own aren't best to part represent our side of the bargain. That doesn't mean you can't have free trade with them to mutual advantage.

You're inconsistent. You pretend to be for free trade but aren't willing to use the same rules to compete.

&gt;AND THE DIFFERENCE IS IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE - MAKING THEM FAR LESS LIKELY TO WANT TO GET CAUGHT.

Baseless assertion.

&gt;Try changing an agreement that has been agreed between 28:1 states versus renegotiating 1:1.

I'm confident that the EU is better able to (re)negotiate a treaty to its liking, simply because they have a much bigger bargaining chip.

&gt;Once it's passed it proves nightmarish to repeal because you have to go to 27 other countries to get it through.

As a shortcut, lower your standards slightly. Remember that girls/women almost exclusively date *up* in terms of socio and economical status, and that they will only remain attracted to you (read: ""treat you with respect"") as long as you can turn them on.

Also, masculinity is important. 

Remain stoic, always keep your cool, dress like a man, and never forget that they will always, constantly and relentlessly be testing your frame and your manhood.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389611475.0,"Oppressive situation would be only if UK didn't join EU in the first place and was just absorbed by them. USSR took Eastern Europe after II WW - that was FUCKING oppressive and Western countries didn't really care about it, nor they care even to this point, as is clearly shown by how some people treat Eastern Europeans, without realising what was the actual cause of them being poorer than western nations.

If I lived in the country where wearing a veil is something normal (i.e. majority of this country supports it) then I would have to wear it - no buts. I could try to make a case, to start a party which would oppose this (if I was allowed, parties in UK can say nearly anything) but if my party was not doing good enough what would be my point to join some international level committee of Muslims, which doesn't have in its principle anything to do with the discussions about wearing the veil.... especially that my only focus here would be to not to wear the veil personally and in my country, not in the whole world. Obviously comparing veil and such complex institution like EU is not an adequate example.

Better example would be to live in the country with Muslim majority where most people would support being Muslim. My aim would be to completely take away Muslim faith in this country. I then join that international panel of Muslims, take their money and spy on what they do (all done officially) to use information to convince people from my country to abandon Muslim religion. Obviously I wouldn't be participating nor trying to change anything in that religion as I oppose it fully without proper justification. Oh and my main attack points would be for example ""taking off shoes policy"" when entering someone's house or anything similar (not major things like with Muslims bhurka for women which clearly is an oppression for females) or I would be using Muslim religion as an excuse that Hindu people start settling in my country - no connection whatsoever."
silverionmox,europe,1389611480.0,"&gt;Where do I refuse? I point out that you don't have the legal tools, and until you have changed the law you should follow it. Or are you saying as soon as one doesn't like the law, one should just ignore it? Why aren't the Eurozone following the law? Why aren't you trying to change the treaty and the ECB statues throught democratic process? You have had over a decade - why? Is it OK for everyone to ignore the treaty and the law if you can? Why, or why not? 

If you keep stalling the necessary reforms - the role of the ECB as a lender of last resort - then you can't complain when it has to be rammed through as an emergency measure. Every currency needs a central bank with that function. Delaying that measure was dangerous and irresponsible, and has allowed a lot of preventable damage to the EU economy.

&gt;Yes, but that will hardly solve the problem. They are not allowed to go above 2 % nor do an aggressive politics like the Fed or the Bank of England (which have aided in the US and the UK recovery), the only thing the ECB is looking at is inflation.

We have the possibility. Which policy is followed in practice, of course, is another matter.

&gt;No, they would not have the same debt crises, since they would not have been able to borrow at the low Eurozone interest rates

The debt crisis originated in the banking sector, not in the state finances. Greece simply was the weakest link, and it got out of hand only because the ECB wasn't allowed to buy up debt as a measure of last resort yet.

&gt; Furthermore, they would not suffer from internal devaluation. 

Given the amound of goods Greece imports, that would hardly have made a difference.

&gt;Also, their lower productivity would be offset by lower prices, so they would not have the unemployment they have now.

Their prices are being lowered now. I'd gladly make that adjustment easier, but someone is against helping individual countries.

&gt;Not if the cure kills the patient. Over 30 % unemployment is not a cure. Also, it will go on for decades. I mean, it has been going on for five years already, and it is not like they are becoming more productive in 2015. Or 2016, or....Think of DDR/BRD. DDR were far less productive (to say the least) and they had the D-mark. To offset that, Germany made investments of trillions, but also kept their social system going, health care, schools etc. 24 years after the reuninon, DDR is still after West Germany. I mean, one can't expect Greece et al to become as productive as the north (since the currency is suited to them) in less than two decades or maybe three. True, they are not DDR, obviously, but they are not receiving any social transfers or investment, only debt and austerity. So, if the cure take three decades - will Greece still live then?

I don't see the problem. Many eastern European countries will take that long to catch up too, and nobody sees that as a problem. It's not like the Greeks were able to have a NorthWestern European standard of living with their wobbly currency.

&gt;Ahem, how is the crises ended when the EZ has enormous unemployment, no rules, growth problems, huge debt and heading into Japan territory.

Half the world is trying to migrate to the EU. That's how bad life is here. Most countries would gladly trade their economy for Japan's.

Also, get rid of whiny bitches and girls who are not in the same mindset as you; to become better every day if possible. The fat bitches don't put work in to look good so they are irrelevant.

Depending on how frugal you actually want to be: it's actually INCREDIBLY simple to change your own brake pads. Check them too.

All you need is a spanner and a G-clamp.You just have to get the tyre off (you know how to do that right?). Then you'll see the big steel metal disc (rotor) and what looks like a clamp or vice.  This is held on by two screws. You undo those screws and BE CAREFUL not to let the clamp hang from the brake hoses!! It's not rocket science, you just sit it on top rather than let it fall down. Then the ceramic brake pads just pop right out, they usually have a little metal spring clip or something. You then use the clamp to push the hydraulic brake pusher thing back. You just push it back. It's easy. Then you pop your new pads in, bolt it back up, put the wheel on, and pump the brake pedal a couple of times to get brake pressure back up. 

It's dead simple.

People will go on and on about needing to resurface or replace the rotor. Truth is that's not entirely necessary. When you've got the wheel off you can see for yourself how much rotor is left. Chances are there's heaps. They only really remachine them every time so that there's a brand new shiny surface for the brand new shiny brake pad instead of all the old scratches and scrapes from the last dirty old pad. 

Fact is that if you put an new pad on a crusty old rotor then by the time you get to the end of the street then your new brake pad will have literally burnt into the shape of the rotor. There's no reduction in braking power here - friction is independent of contact area. Really. There is a slight reduction in braking power when you have too much heat - so don't pull this stunt right before you're going onto the racing track, but for your day to day driving, honestly, as long as your rotor is still structurally pretty good, you can just go ahead and spend $30 on a set of pads and install them in an hour at home without any real problems other than the fact that brake pads are REALLY dirty.

You'll be fine. Try it. It won't bite.

(edit: to check your brake pads all you have to do is get the wheel off and have a look up inside the clamp with a torch. It might help you to get the things off (which is easy as already discussed), then you're looking for more than 3mm of actual ceramic material on the pad. Less than 2 is huge alarm bells, but you get the exact same braking power with 0.5mm of pad as 10mm, so maybe you can choose to do what I'm doing which is waiting until after this upcoming trip to replace my pads because I know they'll need to be done then but in the meantime I'd rather spend my money on camping supplies than car parts that aren't dead yet.)"

&gt;So with that said, what is your gender related story and how did it influence your views?

My history with gender is surprisingly undramatic. For exemple when I was ~13 I played a lot of an rpg called Morrowind. At one point I found out that starting stats didn't neccessarily match across genders. From that point on I made all my mages (reliant on mental stats) female because I simply didn't consider the possibility that there were people who didn't take it for granted that girls were smarter than boys. Almost certainly an artifact of the misandistic school system I was in at the time, but I can't point to any specific event that would explain it.

&gt;What is your area's culture like? How has it effected you?

A very wierd combination of sexist and anti-sexist.  I'm Norwegian for reference. Norwegian culture combines a very strong belief in gender equality with an equally strong belief in gender segregation. There are men's jobs, interrests, hobbies, etc. and there are women's jobs, interrests, hobbies, etc. and there is a strong belief that these are and should be seperate but equal.

This is backed up by an extremely socially conservative feminism (or it usally has been, the last few years norwegian feminists have been stuck in a quagmire of a conflict with sex workers over the legal status of sex work which has limited their visibility on other issues)

I'm not sure to what degree this has affected me, I certainly haven't accepted it, but it's possible it's pushed me in the other direction."

Seriously, what would you like to be done?  Move the checkpoint outside?  That's even worse.  Its more open so that there is more opportunity for malevolence that is much harder to defend against.  Its an unreasonable drain on resources to check every person in their vehicle as they arrive at the airport so that's out.  Space restrictions prevent expansion of line space which is determined at the end of the day by the airport operator and their security crew.  There isn't much that can be done about the lines.  That said, there is likely security systems in place that do preliminary checks on a person as early as when you buy your ticket to try and mitigate some things.  Beyond that, attacking a queue at the airport just isn't that valuable a target.  Sure you can get some mass hysteria going on but the amount of times it needs to be done to make an impact is actually pretty high and terrorist groups don't have a huge amount of human resource that are willing to commit suicide.  Because of the finite resources, targets have to fulfill more than one objective by disrupting the economy and/or disrupting government and/or making political statements and/or causing the populace to begin demanding the government change policy and/or etc."
Navi1101,depression,1389612540.0,"I didn't specifically get Tofu as a means of combatting my depression, buy I know I would have killed myself years ago if I didn't have his kitty cuddles to comfort me. I had a rabbit too, coincidentally with my darkest hour, and thinking ""I could off myself, but then Tofu and Stew would go hungry"" kept me going many a time when I felt like I had nothing else left.

So, yes, having a pet does worlds of good. I recommend a cat, as they're easy to take care of and cause minimal trouble. Tofu is an indoor/outdoor cat, so he comes and goes as he pleases; it's like having a furry, affectionate roommate. And that kind of company is enormously helpful when you're living alone.

nyneve,AskMen,1389612672.0,"&gt;With two kids already, he'll notice if the third one wasn't his.

I don't necessarily agree because it is possible to prime a person's beliefs. If someone is told a false statement is true, and they have no reason to suspect otherwise, that person will use that statement as a reference point and adjust their future information in the direction of the statement. The concept is called anchoring in economics and is borrowed from psychology. I'm not sure if the name differs between sciences but here is an excerpt that describes the concept:

""In anchoring, the subject forms beliefs by adjusting from a potentially arbitrary starting point, and the bias is that the final belief is biased toward this anchor; adjust away from it is insufficient. For example, Tversky and Kahneman asked subjects to guess what fraction of African countries were members of the United Nations. Those who were asked ""is it more or less than 10%?"" guessed a median of 25%, while those who had been asked ""is it more or less than 65%"" guessed a median of 45%.""  (p. 10)

So even if you are earning a good wage, to garnish it with more money from the same job you actually have to work much harder and longer per $ than doing something menial. as the criteria for success (promotion) is much more severe.

so actually in real terms what work you would need to do to get a promotion and earn an extra $200 a month or so, could be much more significant than earning that from some other revenue stream (depending on your position and job)

It's an old speakeasy from the 1920s, hidden in the backroom of the Tavern Law bar. If you like swing music and fancy cocktails it's a good place to go. The only thing is you have to make reservations well in advance and the drinks can be a bit pricey. You also don't get to order your own drink, you tell the bartender what kind of thing you're interested in, and they custom make you a drink, depending on what you tell them you like. Depending on your budget this might fall under ""ridiculously expensive."" I've been there once, got 2 drinks, it cost me about $30--you don't go to get drunk, though, you go for the awesome atmosphere and the fantastic cocktails. You can also go to the [Tin Table](http://www.thetintable.com/) for dinner, which runs you around $12-20 a plate.

If you like Indian food, go to [Taste of India](http://www.tasteofindiaseattle.com/home/index.html) in the u-district. They might have the best Indian food I've ever had. I get the mango chicken, it is delicious. Plates are about $11-14. Occasionally they give you free dessert. Cedars in the U-district is also good (rumor has it it's run by the same people, but I don't know for sure). 

If you wind up in North Seattle, around Ravenna or Wedgewood, get Chinese at Black Pearl, or get a beer at [Third Place Pub](http://www.vioscafe.com/viospub.html). Black Pearl has the best fried rice (it's somehow not greasy), and Third Place pub has a good beer selection, a great ambiance, and a bookstore upstairs. 

There's also always Pike Place Market, and the Seattle Art Museum (which is free the first Thursday of every month and has a great collection). If you're a theater person (I am), [ACT](http://www.acttheatre.org/) has very good shows and is less expensive than the Paramount. [Arts West](http://www.artswest.org/) is also generally pretty decent, if you want to head over to West Seattle. 

Go to the waterfront, the aquarium can be fun. [The Crab Pot](http://www.thecrabpotseattle.com/) is also a fun place if you like to eat messy sea food (they give you a bib and a hammer if you order one of their ""seafests""). It's right on the water, and will run you between $12 and $40 a plate, depending on what you get. Plan for a 20-40 minute wait, depending on how large your party is, and what time/day you go (aka, don't go for dinner on a Saturday with 4 people if you don't want to wait a while).

Min erfaring siger mig, at hvis man gør folk opmærksom på fælden (uden at skrive dømmende), så fjerner de linket og lærer af det. Eller også har de slettet mig som ven / deler ikke opslaget med mig, og i så fald er jeg ligeglad.

Farage shouldn't be fighting with the EU that way as it doesn't have proper moral justification from neutral point of view.

Travellerknight,changemyview,1389613280.0,"I definitely agree that there is some fundamental differences in how we view the problems but the world would be boring if we all agreed all the time.

Ok lets play the game and discuss what would happen if the UK became independent. Firstly yes we would most likely get worse trade agreements, as we would have to fight others in Europe more willing to help other EU countries, meaning we would have to go lower to compete.
Immigration could arguably be less but that would leave holes in our job sector, Immigrants are far more likely to take the lower class jobs in the UK, especially the entitlement felt by the locals due to residual class issues, ie who would want to be a fry cook at McD's?
Businesses will suffer as those in Europe will likely switch to other European nations to avoid additional tax and the fluctuations in currency prices. We have already agreed on this, your benefits lets discuss them:

The UKs fishers are insanely large for the size of our country, seriously we take to much, especially from Ireland. The only country whom arguably takes more would be Iceland, and I assume you know our problems with them, but they aren't EU, this has been a benefit to us, as we use the EU to beat them back, as Iceland awarded itself the majority fishing rights of Mackral in the North Sea, the EU awarded it to the UK and Ireland, which is more likely the rest of the EU will support? and are currently one of the reasons we are vetoing Iceland's entry in the EU is due to there infringement on our fishing areas and there refusal to pay back money borrowed, unsurprisingly the EU is on our side for both previsions [1](http://www.icenews.is/2010/06/22/david-cameron-willing-to-use-uk-veto-to-block-iceland-eu-entry/) [2](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/european-union/101221/iceland-mackerel-quota-eu-membership)
Therefore I argue that in regards to fisheries, the EU has been a better benefit to the UK and not being within the EU.

I felt that the monetary gain we get from leaving the EU would be less than the monetary gain we get from being within the EU, this is ignoring the provisions that all the UK to get a percentage of the money it pays into the EU back through the monetary rebate [3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_rebate). Something ironically enough I disagree with, as its seems a bit strange that we should be singled out for a rebate on something that is vastly out of date.

People should naturally change to green policies but honestly none want to because of the ever growing strength of the climate change denial lobby. As such I feel the EU is a fantastic way of everyone agreeing to do something fair at the same time. 

Fish quotas are very important, the seas especially around the UK are empty, we need the quotas to ensure there are fish for future generations, the problems are individual fishermen thinking they can get away with just a few etc fish this time, they get caught doing something they know they shouldn't then get in a huff all over the news with it. There is also the problem of Iceland and Norway not technically being within the EU (although Norway has agreed to follow the provisions) and they come up with there own quotas, see my iceland reference again.
If everyone agreed to follow the same set of laws and quotas then there wouldn't be a problems of wasted fish, this is not the EU's fault, its fisherman's greed!!

Obvious waste being what? EU money is being spent in the following areas:

• Administration Running the EU in each country
• The EU as a global partner International aid, activities outside the EU
• Citizenship, freedom, security and justice Asylum, education and culture
• Preservation and management of natural resources Common agricultural policy, environment, fishing
• Cohesion for growth and employment Helping poorer regions of Europe
• Competitiveness for growth and employment Economic growth grants to small business, science and research [4](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/22/eu-budget-spending-contributions-european-union)

Honestly to me, those all sound necessary, i'm not sure where I would cut those, knowing cutting administrative costs would also slow down the whole system, probably causing more problems. Personally I would get rid of obvious waste in the wages of euro-skeptic MEP's who don't contribute, why should they get paid to literally sit there and do nothing, even if they formed a comity to discuss why the EU sucks **thats** at least something.

I feel that this is the fundamental difference in opinion between us. I feel that the Asian tigers did so well due to big government, remember South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships in their early years, the definition of big governments, this allowed the framework for the country to be organised on lines that lead to their huge growth in the later parts of the 20th Century. After the fall of the Dictatorships, they didn't suddenly become small governments, with the state having massive control in many of its corporations, and still do to this day.

The UK differs but no more so than all the countries differ from each other. Its only due to a British exceptionalist national feeling that this view is portrayed. On borders we have the same agreements that the rest of the EU has with Ireland and France. Fisheries I've discussed above how the EU is usual on our side. We are more fiscally conservative agreed but I feel politically, with the exception of the Nordic countries we are pretty similar. 

Switzerland obvious is more ""Independent"" as is Norway and similar to Denmark in keeping our own currency. As such I don't agree with your idea at being ""more Independent"".

We win in voting more often than you think, it just doesn't sell news in the UK to talk about when the EU helps us, not to mention that due to our huge economy we have a large veto power for many decisions.

The UK have a vote already, my argument is to put yourself whole heartedly into the EU, put our best politicians into it, and make it work better, than just bitching that it doesn't work.

The UK have the biggest banking sector? then they should be in the Euro, making it even stronger and using its superior banking skills to make the Euro monetary union more efficient and fair, as opposed to washing its hands, saying it doesn't affect it as it has its own currency. 

Honestly covered the fish thing several times but it helps the UK is an island and has the political clout to say this sea is mine and can hold it. It should follow the EU law and give Spain more sea, but that is something to be negotiated.

Finally, I believe that the net payer into the EU at the moment is Germany, followed by France [5](http://ec.europa.eu/budget/figures/interactive/index_en.cfm)"

mundabit,TrollXChromosomes,1389613354.0,"I had a craving for cookies today, the power went out so the oven wouldn't turn on. I'm not even mad.

My go-to cookie dough recipe if anyone wants it:

2 cups Self raising flour (Substitute with plain flower and 2tsp [baking powder](http://frugalliving.about.com/od/condimentsandspices/r/Baking_Powder.htm) if needed.)  
3/4 cup any type of dry sugar or sugar substitute 
1/2 cup of oil (coconut is best IMO. avoid Olive oil, as it has a strong taste)  
1/2 cup of water, or tea, or milk or milk substitute (eg: soy milk)

Then flavour it with whatever you like, vanilla extract, cocoa powder, mushed banana's (cut out some oil if you add banana's)

If you can be bothered, roll into balls, flatten slightly, place on a baking tray, they spread only slightly so 1cm is enough spacing. Bake at 180C for 10 minutes, they are really soft when they come out, but harden as they cool. 

This recepie is great because I never have eggs or butter in the house, but I always feel like cookies. and because its a 'base' recipe you can add anything to it, like peanut butter or choc-chips. Just adjust the oil and milk content to compensate.

tPRoC,pics,1389613375.0,"&gt;Starry Night is about the hidden beauty and complexities of the sky that people usually fail to truly appreciate, 

I hate to tell you this but people have been enamored by the night sky for millennia. Liking the night sky does not make you special. I guarantee you Van Gogh wasn't thinking ""Why the fuck isn't anyone appreciating the night sky!?! Surely someone will appreciate it if I do an impressionist painting of it."" as he painted The Starry Night. He painted it because he thought the night sky was beautiful, and he wanted to challenge himself.

&gt;as well as bringing out the true colour of the world if you care to look for it. It's overwhelming and stunning and extraordinary.

These are all visual things. There is no ""meaning"" behind it, it's visually stunning- it looks cool/beautiful/great.

&gt;The Mona Lisa is an overrated painting, but it's a great demonstration of the technical skills of da Vinci, capturing the human profile expertly using paint alone. It's a personal show-piece.

None of this gives it ""meaning"" in the way we're discussing.

The guy was asking what the meaning of the painting is- he wanted some pretentious, STEMlord garbage about how it represents the oppression of coffee from loving other coffee because it's trapped in a cup or something. ""Art needs to have *meaning* or it's pointless, what is this *saying* about the problems in society today?""

It's still art.

&gt;I think you could have picked some better works of art to rhetorically ask ""what's the meaning behind x?""

No, these ones are great choices because the ""meaning"" you provided was nothing but a description of how great the painting looks. You can provide a similar explanation for the sculpture in OP's picture.

Allan pressed his lips together and shuffled nervously. ""All in good time madam. However before we go I need to make you aware of the Judgement so you are legally aware of the steps we are bound to take today."" 

He looked back to his clipboard. 

""You are a member of the Catholic parish of St Michael, are you not?""

""Well yes, but how does that have...""

""Then I asume you belong to the Catholic church, is that correct?""

""Yes, but that doesn't mean I...""

He looked sadly over the top of the clipboard. ""Then I am empowered by the court to reposses you and deliver you to my client, Luciasterothbaal LLC.""

He lowered his clipboard and looked me in the eye.

""You lot never got it did you. The great struggle between good and evil didn't take the form of angels with flaming swords fighting bat winged demons in the ether anymore than the real struggles between ideologies here were fought in public. The real power lies behind closed doors carved in legalese.""

""Well, it's the time of Judgement. God lost. And he has to pay court costs, too.""

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389614136.0,"You should also add moving companies from UK to overseas (to cut costs by having a foreign employee in a foreign country - mostly in third world where everything is very cheap) as well as buying goods produced in those countries.

At the end of the day people on general are selfish. When faced with buying UK and Spanish strawberries, they will most likely choose the ones which are cheap (if the taste is the same). Even if UK strawberries were to taste better, there is only a certain amount more when a person in UK would pay for it (I doubt someone will pay twice just for the little better tasting thing and the fact of its origin country).

The same with migration. In 2004 UK had pretty low unemployment. Cheap labour was required as if unemployment were to reach a very very low level, there would be most likely shortages in fulfilling of jobs. Immigrants came, filled jobs, all was fine.... until world crisis started and unemployment rose. Now UK doesn't want any longer immigrants and although it's a free market and nobody can force you to employ an immigrant, employers still prefer them because of number of reasons. Then the locals say immigrants undercut wages - which wouldn't be a case if unemployment was lower.

Migration of cultures, not blending into society etc are far less important points. Otherwise Britain would have stopped immigration years ago. It is all about money and also local's attitudes. Some will complain they are undercut, or that an immigrant took his job - very often not looking at the fact that he is lazy or wants too much money.

Also, as Britain is generally a rich country, means certain production in UK simply can't have higher costs (thus requirement for ""cheaper"" immigrants who work without complaining). If UK was to suddenly cut all ""cheap"" immigrants who do jobs most of them want it would be a choice of ""paying twice for UK strawberries"", ""not importing foreign strawberries at all (people forced to buy UK's ones)"" or ""not having strawberries produced in UK"". The same thing was with Thatcher closing mines in UK. It was cheaper to import so unless people were to pay more for locally mined coal, they would either had to close local mines or pay from the government extra - thus closure was sought and achieved."

Grymninja,summonerschool,1389614413.0,"Although I see where you're coming from, I don't really agree with some of it. 

Some of us watch a lot of challenger level games, know the strategic ward positioning, know how to block invades and what skill to take at level 1 if going for the invade, how to flash ignite at level 2 for an agressive kill, passive-bait playstyles etc...

We just can't carry it out because of horrible reaction time and team mates that aren't aware of the same tactics. I will admit, my reaction time currently sucks and I don't know as much as a plat player. However I'd consider game knowledge to be at least silver level, even if actual gameplay is not up to that standard. Don't underestimate your opponent bro. 

MrPikkels made a bad comparison though, a diamond player will wreck any level 20. :(

Travellerknight,changemyview,1389614519.0,"I agree that it would take significant improvements across the board to be done, my argument for education would be the idea of this being a good and necessary step for Europeans to take on the whole.

Arab spring took everyone by surprise, its shouldn't have but it did and there was much confusion about what to do. Libya was a case in which Europe was fighting itself over in deciding what to do. With the UK wanting to get involved in a hands off way. The disaster of Afghanistan and Iraq has definitely put a bad taste in the European mouth towards international interventions.

There was also strong opposition in every European country in getting involved in civil wars in other countries, you difficult to assign blame when those in charge wanted to do something but the public feeling betrayed and rightful skeptical didn't want to get involved. If the public had been this skeptical we might not have jumped into bed with America in Iraq, leading to potentially more willingness to be involved in something more worthwhile such as Libya.

Tunisia has sorted itself out, the only proof that the Arab spring would work. Syria is a clusterfuck, and to get involved would provoke Russia, which Europe doesn't want to do as it gets most of its Gas from Russia. Egypt is a difficult one, and honestly nobody in Europe would want to get involved in 2 arab spring uprisings at once, when we were involved in Libya.

Also its important to point out, the EU didn't want to jump in and support the rebels immediately, as if they had lost, which in all likelyhood would have happened early on, then it would have made dealing with the leadership in Libya strained, not to mention its illegality according to the UN, something the EU takes very seriously.

The EU doesn't pretend its here to save the world, it makes plans for every eventuality, even that being the bad guy winning"

lordfuzzywig,startrek,1389614806.0,"I think this makes sense, actually. I view the giant starships floating in space not unlike the submarines of WW2 in many, many ways. They do have a finite amount of resources and power, and keeping shields up is a relatively draining affair one would imagine.

In ST:O, shields are up any time combat is likely and they slowly regenerate and can be shifted to reinforce one side of the ship in particular etc. and shield management is an important aspect of combat. If you put too much focus on your shields, you're harming your auxillary systems. If you do that, you might have a really powerful offensive and defensive setup, but you're not able to fly as fast, for example. Likewise, you can lower shields somewhat to fly faster, or do more damage, etc.

So I think there is a natural dynamic there, in regards to power management. When shields are raised, the Captain or her crew have decided they need a more defensive power setup. You wouldn't want a lot of power diverted to shields when it could be used to fly faster (and therefore manuever) or pump out more hurt."

Alphadestrious,TheRedPill,1389615135.0,"I know some amazing girls who are so driven to succeed it's scary and they all tell me they don't really need a man (yeah right). And they all know how to hold their own which is attractive, but a lot of girls now aren't brought up in that type of way of cooking and house chores and all that. I'm not saying its good or bad just how things really are, which is fine it's up to the girl to live her life.

Now unfortunately, the judicial system is skewed towards women for various reasons. There are some good Dad's/husbands that get screwed over and their money vanishes in an instance. I would go as far as to say in the social media age we live in girls ARE CONSTANTLY validated by men who leave comments on facebook, etc. We all have seen it. This helps women out tremendously and with that they sometimes garner a huge following which more often than not gets to their heads. As if being the most liked, followed, or anything of that nature really correlates to real life. There was a study done where the biggest number of people you can have as good friends and actually keep in contact is between 50 - 70 or something like that forgive my accuracy. It's impossible to have thousands of friends that you really know of, the rest are just random people or acquaintances.

In addition, I can't even imagine how some of these attractive girls must feel when they wake up in the morning with lots of comments telling her how beautiful she is and so forth. It must be so consuming and powerful to them at the same time. Narcissist? Maybe or maybe not but that's the direction this generation is heading. Social media changed the game for the better and for the worse. 

Which ties in to my point that women have the upperhand in social media since we all know women are better communicators than men for the most part and thus are a huge driving force for these social media companies. Heck, even commercials and other things I see now play poppy girl music. I ain't about that life, I'm about the hard in the paint let's get to battle type of music. Women are a huge demographic and target market for businesses now that I see a lot of companies trying to become more gender-neutral to maximize profit. "

Let's say you kill him at level 6. Your ignite and flash are now on cooldown, his ult is on cooldown, you're low enough to die to the enemy jungler should he come to lane. You recall under your tower, at which point Mundo is halfway back to his lane (or already there if he took teleport). You can not fight with him while your ignite is off cooldown, because he significantly outdamages most champions at this point in the game. Also, it's now a minute later and his ult is back up again. Sure, once your ignite is back up you might kill him another time. BUT, he will possibly have his sunfire cape at this point, and here's my biggest problem with Mundo: he only needs a single item and he's good to go for almost 20-25 minutes. If you want to deal with him 1v1, you need to bring a lost more than one lousy item, or he will just run over you like a train. And don't even start with saying that you can still 2v1 him, because if at any point in the game a single champion with ONE completed item REQUIRES two champions to be dealt with, how is that not OP as FUCK?"

lordfuzzywig,WTF,1389615453.0,"It's not the best weapon. Far from. But imagine, if you will, the tactical implications of having an improvised firearm. Suddenly, you no longer have to ""tumble"" with the guy you're stabbing. You can do the equivalent of a drive-by. You just point, pull, and move on. In a crowd, due to the ""no-snitch"" mentality, a person could completely get away with it.

Also, most officers do not have vests at all. If they do, they're generally stab-proof. There are three types of vests: ballistic (""bulletproof""), stab, and slash. Stab is very effective against icepick-style weapons, but can be slashed through like butter. Slash is the opposite. Ballistic is vulnerable to either. So an inmate with an improvised firearm, even with just one shot, knows he has impunity for the most part until the tactical team retrieves weapons.

Improvised firearms are probably way less than 10% of weapons we find. Even setting 10% as the maximum number might be too high. Foeces-covered shanks are far more common.

As for people who have died, no, they are no less notable, did i say that? But like war vets, for example, while there are still war vets, you still make accomodations for them and ceremony for them, to remember their dead. You actively honor them for as long as they're still around to be honored.

The point is, OP would rather there was no black history month at all. My implication is while there may be an argument for winding BHM down *at some point*, its probably not a good idea, till that generation who fought for civil liberties are still alive and kicking.

&gt; Besides, it's not like civil rights isn't covered in regular history classes.

I would hazard a guess it comes under reparation. It wasn't just civil rights, and the segregation before it, slavery too. America is trying to make amends for a brutal history, to black people, not other races, because it wasn't other races who faced the same kind of oppression blacks did.

Its not fuck white people month, its not *yay PoC* month, its just about the people we imprisoned and traded like livestock, then spent another age oppressing them once they were ""free"". Its a gesture of reparation for that. It seems to me to be a good thing."

That's irrelevant. Aviación Nacional was merged with Athletic de Madrid after the War because they wanted to play in Primera División and Athletic de Madrid accepted.

reginaidiotarum,AskReddit,1389616200.0,"Between the internet and the weird entertainment phase that America is currently into, you can make good money doing whatever you like. Think closely about yourself and your interests. Is there something that your friends trust you to do? Maybe clean-up after parties or sew buttons on or organize everyone to get together? If you think about it, these are all services that people could pay for if you generate the right idea and market. 

If you are good at cleaning up after parties, you are probably used to dealing with gross stuff, see what you need to do waste removal renovations on former homes. I've seen what tenants can do to places, and a rich landlord would rather pay someone to do this over the course of a few days for a few hundred dollars.

If you are good at sewing buttons, keep sewing. Get good at it. You treat sewing like it's a second job, like do 20 to 30 hours a week on top of searching for a new job. Sew custom quilts for people, or design a cute little stuffed animal. Same goes for writing and art. I will stress, however, that while you may not have a physical person telling you what to do, you still have a boss in your audience. If you paint for a living, you must paint what you can sell, and keep your ego out of it.

Coordinating people is what I do. I'm the type of person that contacts everyone to get together for D&amp;D. It's project management, whether your group is rolling dice or reassembling furniture, you need a leader. If you want this job, you need to study business and make sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to. The cleaner and the sewer probably won't know where to go, and that's where you come in. You make the tough decisions, and if someone doesn't believe in the spirit of what you are doing, you may need to fire them.

Last thing. No matter what you do, you are in sales. You constantly sell yourself. This means giving business cards to people you meet in the super market. This means being helpful to a stranger just so you can get your plug in. And this means being able to deliver your full service speech while hungover.

It takes about two years to establish a business, which sounds shitty, but  if you compare that time to the four years and tens of thousands of dollars of college that you need to get a job that may end up with a promotion to where you want to go someday, you'll have a head start."

totally_jawsome,relationship_advice,1389616307.0,"I think there are people who are a lot more qualified to answer this than me but I will still give an opinion.

In this situation I think you should re-evaluate what you find important in a relationship. Like, what you find sacred. Everyone is different. For me my SO acting flirty or physical with another girl is not as big of a deal as my SO talking intimately with another girl. That being said, my SO taking sexual photos of himself in private for someone else would ruffle my feathers, parse, but him doing it for a public photoshoot wouldn't bother me. 

However, it sounds like your girlfriend enjoys the attention that she gets when doing these photoshoots and I believe that should be addressed first and foremost. It's the same as girls who take pictures for gonewild and boyfriends find them. They're usually just into that sort of thing and somehow they have to find a happy medium.

I think you should confront this issue and tell her that if she wants to continue modeling then both of you need to sit down and create some boundaries. Tell her what you are ok and not ok with in a photoshoot session and even discuss what you find appropriate with other people. For instance, my boyfriend and I could be classified as ""almost"" an open relationship, or swingers or whatever. Which sometimes has caused us great confusion, until we set down and discussed our boundaries, example, we are not allowed to touch anyone else sexually without talking about it first. It may seem simple but being on the same page with your partner is usually a huge oversight. Albeit an innocent one, but an oversight all the same.

Things I think you should do:

* Discuss this in detail with your partner. Tell her your feelings, tell her your ideals, and tell her what this means for you. However, she is going to tell you her feelings, her ideals, and her meaning and you must be open to receive it.

* Discuss boundaries. Talk about what is or isn't okay in photoshoots, other people, and just in general. Somehow I think a lot of couples forget that this needs to be discussed in any long term relationship.

* Move on. After you've come to an agreement, whether it be she stops doing lingerie shoots, maybe you go with her to the shoots or maybe she does them but you get say so on which ones she does etc. You have to move on through it. Whatever the outcome is it's not the end of the world. No grudges, no holding it over either persons head, just move through it.


Personally, I think you should become active in her photography. Perhaps start going with her to the sets that way you can be there as a buffer for any sexual advances and to let other people know you're involved and this is your partner. "

codayus,javascript,1389616403.0,"There are two main arguments about Backbone versus Angular when it comes to scale:

1. If it's not testable, it doesn't scale.  Angular tries to (and in my view, largely succeeds at) encouraging developers to write more testable code than Backbone does, therefore it scales better than Backbone does.
2. Backbone requires a *lot* of boilerplate.  The bigger the app, the more boilerplate.  Eventually you drown under it, *OR* you use (or write your own) framework to bring it under control.  Chaplin and Marionette are very popular.  But at that point you're no longer using *Backbone*, you're using a framework based *on* Backbone that is designed to work for large, complicated applications.  :)

A good blog post that covers the latter part is here:  http://blog.nebithi.com/backbone-and-angular-demystifying-the-myths/

I can manage to win by science or domination, but I have a really hard time (especially on King) trying to win by culture or diplomacy, because those require peaceful relationships with the AI and the warmongering ones declare war so often. 

Recent scenario: Continents, Large (8 players), King difficulty. I start on an island shared with Japan.  Japan declares war on me super early (he was attacking with warriors, archers, and 1 catapult) .  I don't have nearly his army, but my city defended itself and I turned around with a few catapults and captured one of his cities, and took his third in the peace deal, leaving him with only his capitol.  Many turns later I took his capitol, leaving me the only one on my island. 

Later in the game, Spain declares war on me, and has a pretty big army, and will not make a good peace deal.  I'm trying not to go offensive and take her out, but how do I negotiate a good peace deal without shaking her up a little?

Then Atilla lands a settler on a far corner of my island, masses troops, and surprise attacks me (we were friendly previously).  He takes my farthest city (it was originally Japan's) and razes it, so I stomp back across the map, take his city, and raze it. 

But now I've spent hundreds of turns at war, wasting production on units and not progressing on my preferred victory route (I want to win diplomatically this game).

Im not even suggesting that, but the fact you resent their being a BHM, but ""dont care enough"" to try and be constructive about winding it down, kinda hints to me that you want to get rid of it because it offends you, as a white person, not because it falls short of respecting black history, say, for being only a month, not just american history, period.

&gt; As a psychologist, I'm really concerned that he's very depressed, but he absolutely won't accept my help and will not see another psychologist about it because he refuses to deal with his issues. 

As a person with depression, I should know it is very unlikely that your bf is going to change, and therefore I don't see this working out, as painful as it may be for you to realize that. For years I never thought I had depression because I wasn't suicidal. How wrong I was. Meds helped me immensely. (Honestly, I think my anxiety makes me plain fatigued, and I don't think I have depression, as fatigue is my main issue.)

I know you know this is very treatable, and it must be painful for you to watch, like a train wreck in slow motion. I think you need to understand he won't change unless he wants to. 

&gt;  I love him and I want to make it work, I'm just posting here because I would like a guy's perspective. 

1. I am not convinced you are experienced enough to know that love is not enough. He has to want to change. If he doesn't want to change, there is no potential for him to get better, or for this to go any further. 
2. I think you need to hear this from someone who actually has depression and used to be in a similar situation. 
3. How can you be 22 and have a PhD in psychology? In the US a ""psychologist"" has a PhD. A master's degree gives you the title ""therapist"". A 4 year degree majoring in psychology is just ""majored in psych"".

lordfuzzywig,dgu,1389617877.0,"&gt;Just out of curiosity, I have a friend who is a hemophiliac and I've always wondered is how the use of deadly force would apply to him. It would take a blow of far less magnitude to seriously injure or kill someone with a bleeding disorder like this. He's a somewhat big guy, but a person who is much smaller or appeared much weaker would almost certainly pose more of a vital threat to him than he would to them.

This would fall under what is known as a ""disparity of force"", wherein one person is innately capable of doing more damage than the other. The most obvious case being, for example, a 300lb. linebacker vs. a 100lb. geriatric. There is a clear disparity of force on a number of levels.

From the AOJP standard, and the reasonableness standard, it stands to reason that he has a clear-cut case of being able to fear for his life in cases that another person might not.

With that said, what it all really comes down to is what HE REASONABLY AND TRULY BELIEVES is a legitimate threat to his life **right then and there**, which will not be all that different from your average Joe. He must preclude, in any way possible, the use of deadly force. So having his condition does not mean he suddenly becomes a Superman who can draw a gun with impunity because he might get hit and bleed out in half an hour. The threat must be immediate."
hermithome,nfl,1389617889.0,"Thank you for writing this. I used to be a huge football fan but I've gotten to the point where I'm not only no longer obsessing over stats and trades but I don't even watch anymore. I was always a bigger college football fan, so having my local team become a laughing stock and be involved in several scandals (stupid scandals too, and then ordinary people were hurt by some of the rules that changed in response) definitely got the ball rolling on my detachment but even then I still really enjoyed watching the game in general.

The way they're broadcast now, with everything I see and hear being a commercial of some sort (even the fucking highlights), and the attempt to cram all of the commentary into a bajillion stat boxes that require watching on a hugely massive TV has meant that I no longer default turn to putting the games on. Add that to the fact that I now despise the league itself, and that it's almost impossible to watch a game without having to watch multiple players that I know are shit human-beings...and I just don't bother. Still watch the superbowl, but now I do it for the commercials and the half-time show, whereas I used to watch for the game and be annoyed by everyone who watched for the halftime show and commercials. 

It's too bad really, I used to like the sport a tonne. Sure, I'd go to the huge pool party, but I'd slip into the den with a few other people because I couldn't miss a game. Always figured it would be more fun watching when I got older because more of my friends would be fans. That and I really do like sports bars."

I don't use it like that. The guy I was originally responding to very obviously was.

&gt;""Meaning"" in the art world is more about associations, the interaction and harmony of concepts.

Sometimes, Muslim leaders defend and argue for things like segregation of women, Jihad under extreme circumstances, etc. and defend those arguments with verses from the Quaran.  Other times, no islamic explanation is given, or a poor one is given and other Muslims cite verses in the Quaran against such practices.  In any case if experts in Islamic law defend the practice, you can blame Islam for it.

In this case, no explanation was given, so its not fair to blame Islam for censoring the internet.  However, I think it is fair to argue that Islam is expressly anti-free speech."

Dr_Paco,Smite,1389618048.0,"I started back in March of last year after a friend from BF3 brought the game to my attention. Ended up buying the god pack on the very first day after just a few games, and really enjoyed playing Freya. After a few weeks I took started purchasing and leveling manually, and I'm pretty sure I always started out with boots of celerity and fatalis. Whenever I got low, I would use Freya's ultimate to retreat backwards while shooting off blasts that essentially only did base damage. 

I remember waiting for minions to enter a tower before immediately diving the enemy god in it, not even realizing that the tower would target me. I just figured I entered last so I'd be hit last - took a _long_ time to figure that out.

Time went by and I started playing new gods, and _really_ fell in love with Hel. I ran boots of celerity on her until the boots changed, where I learned how amazing starting out with MP by building towards shoes of focus was. At that point, I was still pretty much a noob so I was facing a lot of other noobs, and that's when they started to complain about me cheating because my Inspire would heal, like, three-fourths of everyone's healthbar early on in the game. Good times.

Still, the most enjoyment I get out of the game is by building Poseidon Boots of Celerity &gt; Winged Wand &gt; Regular Fatalis &gt; Magi's Blessing &gt; sovereignty &gt; Bulwark of Hope and HA + beads and just dicking around behind the enemy team in Arena."

An example would be the night my grandmother suffered her brain aneurysm. I had been thinking about her and called her on the phone early in the evening. After the call, I had a very bad feeling and thought it was maybe attached to her, but could not put my finger on it. I mentioned this in phone conversations with two family members later that night.

Around 4 am, I got a call from a family member. She had suffered a severe headache which she thought was one of her migraines, but it had come to have some symptoms she ""knew weren't right"" so she had got out of bed and called the squad. When the ambulance arrived, they had to break in the front door to enter because they could see her slumped on the floor by the telephone.

I led a busy life as a working single mom at the time. I was cooking dinner while I talked to her. Based on the brain surgeon's comment he could tell the aneurysm had leaked a bit before the main bleed, I feel pretty confident some part of my brain latched on to something. Some oddity in her speech that my busy, half-listening upper brain functions had just not paid any mind to perhaps.

karhall,boston,1389618525.0,"19y/o here and I've lived north of the city (Cape Ann) my whole life, with regular forays into the city for various reasons.

I love the city, it's just a beautiful place. It's not as big as a New York, and I think for that reason it doesn't get the appreciation it deserves. Just the other night, I was driving my friend (a Syracuse native) to Logan so she could fly out. She's a bit of a talker, but when we crested a hill on Rt.1 South and saw the skyline she just froze, mid-sentence. I was like, ""You all right?"", and she just said, ""That's so pretty.""

The history of the area too is so deep and rooted in what America stands for; it was part of the seat of the Revolution. Walking the Freedom Trail gives me chills, seeing all the history my city is attached to. Even up here in Cape Ann you get that feeling too, seeing all the town line markers that say ""Est. 1643"" and the like, or other signs that say stuff like ""On this spot in 1714..."", and the numerous special things like the Historic Districts, where the dates buildings were erected are displayed on the side. Seeing numbers from the 1600s and 1700s is really special to me.

Speaking of Ipswich; if you want to see a historic town that has been preserved in modernity, drive through Ipswich. It's probably the most colonial looking town in Cape Ann. The town square is more or less just the old buildings with modern shops and paved roads. I take people from out-of-state in there all the time for donuts at Marty's and they can't stop talking about how awesome it is. Smaller cities up north too, like Gloucester and Newburyport, give you the same feeling. I love going into Newburyport despite how long the drive up Rt.1 is. There's a great Mexican restaurant, a great bakery my friend works at that sells the best little whoopie pies, awesome shops, and a great view of the water from the docks on the waterfront. There are pretty regular festivals up there, and I make it a point to go to at least a couple during the summer.

But, let's get back to Boston itself. I also really like the people. Maybe I've been conditioned to it from exposure, but I feel they really aren't as rude as out-of-staters make them out to be. And if you do run into a rude one, others around you will let them know they're being a ""fahkin' asshole"" and they'll cut it out. We're a pretty logical people, from what I've observed. It makes me sick when people from out-of-state pick on people from around here for being ""annoying"" or ""rude"" because it's just not true. I don't feel like you should generalize like that; I know New Yorkers aren't all the same, and I know New Jersey isn't defined by Jersey Shore, and I would never call everyone who lives in the boons of the south a ""cousin-fucker"" because I know that just isn't true. Boston is a misunderstood city full of misunderstood people.

And, of course, the sports. I'm old enough to remember the hard times when every one of our teams sucked (late 1990s Pats, pre-2004 Sox,  pre- and post-""Big 3"" Celtics, and the pre-2010 Bruins), but now this city is Sports Town, USA. I love being a Boston sports fan, and now that you know that I'll say *fuck every other fandom* for the jealous, whiny shit that is slung at our fans every day to try and troll us. The reality is our teams are good (except the Celtics, ^damn ^it ^Celtics ) and we were still supporting them when they weren't, so the fact that only now are you getting all butthurt about our fandom is proof that you're just jealous. Fuck the Jets, Fuck the Giants, Fuck the Habs, Fuck the Yankees, and Fuck LeBron!

Hope this answers your question, I love Boston!

EDIT: I forgot to mention one other thing! **THE WEATHER!** All the out-of-state candy-asses who complain about the winter/weather make me laugh. It's just snow; I love the winters! One of my favorite times of year!"

p3ndulum,poker,1389618575.0,"You're varying the size of your pre-flop raises based on their relative strength. I would recommend picking a standard raise size and sticking to it, regardless of your cards.

It doesn't take long for other players to clue in to the fact that your bigger raises are indicative of a bigger hand, and your smaller raises are indicative of a weaker one.

Whether you are bluffing or betting for value, they size of the bet should be the same, especially online - it's the equivilant to having a poker face for Internet poker.

When we (your opponents) can guess with relative accuracy what your hand is, it makes it easier for us to play against you.

If you make a big raise, we know exactly the kind of flop and hand we'll need to make before we put any more chips into the pot against you. And then, when we *do* hit hard, *you're* going to find it very difficult to read the situation and fold your hand - you'll become ""married"" to it.

When your pre-flop raises are always the same size, we can't have any way of knowing what kind of hand you have based on the size of your bet alone, leaving us with, perhaps, your position in the orbit as the only clue. That makes playing against you much more difficult. It also gives you more ways to win pots when you miss your ideal flops because you can begin to represent a wider range of post-flop hands.

What many players forget or simply just don't understand or realize is that nl hold em is a *flop* game. The best players in the world are the ones who excel at reading post-flop situations.

Varying your raises before the flop turns it into a two-card, pre-flop game, which leaves much of your results up to the poker gods (""luck"").

My own strategy and philosophy is to make my standard open 3.5x the size of the big blind, whether I'm opening from UTG or on the button, or whether I'm holding Kings or Aces or 47-suited. By the time my opponents and I get to the flop, they have *no idea* what I have while I have a general idea about what they have (because they didn't raise, I can safely assume they have thingsike small pairs, unpaired broadway cards and suited connectors).

No all theories can work in every regard, especially in regards to governorship, you cannot rule a ship as a democracy but you a country. Different situations require different theories.

Yes you could argue you have greater autonomy in a smaller unit, but it could also be argued that smaller units will tend to attract people whom already agree with that particular groups conscience, moving people away from a middle ground of compromise to the fringes of bullheadedness, as we see in Gerrymandering in politics today.

Not to mention that autonomy of the people is not something that has existed in humanity. We are a group species by definition and the out growth of that is the creating of cities and countries.

Arguably the more people you have in a democratic unit the more likely you are to create a group conscious which is might not ally with your views but might bring about something new.
If you only join with people who are exactly like you and believe exactly like you won't that lead to cultural stagnation as nothing is challenged.

Big corporations are a biproduct of our current political system and I feel that the only thing that can combat them on an equal footing would be stronger government control on them. Do you think big tobacco will listen to a smaller countries, weaker countries? some of them would be vehemently anti-smoking and ban it outright, some would be the opposite. That just leaves the ones undecided for them to focus on, which would probably be less money for them in the long run while increasing their profits, therefore they still win.

lordfuzzywig,startrek,1389619003.0,"A fair point, which is why I think shields get raised when they do. I'm simply saying that having an automatic system or some form of SOP where shields are raised instantly, thereby draining resources for other immediate concerns (such as offensive capabilities, impulse speed, and auxilary systems like transporters, sensor arrays, etc.) would be subprime.

It's all a trade-off. Much like when in WW2 a submarine would submerge itself, right? They could do that for a number of reasons. But every time they did that, it would start draining other resources that would not be drained when surfaced (battery power, etc.).

To further that analogy, I think that shields being raised is not unlike the submersion of a submarine. It rendered the submarine much more difficult to hit -- far from impossible, mind, but more difficult -- and offered a degree of impunity for a time at the expense of radio communications, greater visibility (sensors, in this case), and some auxillary systems such as deck guns and AA guns.

I think, if we were to expand on the practicality of it, it would make more sense for a starship captain to only raise shields to a level deemed appropriate for the threat -- say, 50% as an example. I think raising shields is more a precautionary measure than anything else. We don't get to see the intimate inner-workings of the ship sadly, and it would make for a much less-interesting watch to the general public, I think.

In early WW2, submarines could destroy merchant vessels with impunity even when surfaced (no shields needed). When they started getting escorts and arming themselves, that dynamic changed and they had to start submerging for longer periods for stealth. Know what I'm saying?"

I'm hoping you guys can give me some feedback about a website I am working on for University.

It's about the greatest movies never made and has been compiled as part of one of my modules.

I'm studying a BA (Hons) in Journalism in hopes that I can get into film journalism specifically. 

The layout is pretty much finished and I am now working on shifting in the content and getting an introduction video ready. As well as community feedback on the project, which is why I want/NEED your feedback.

I would like to know films you would like adding, what would make the site easier to use and what you would generally like to see. 

This is a subject I am passionate about, so help would be amazing. There is also a survey you could do! https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/PXMX5KW"

They all claim there are very few places which require deaths to be disclosed. The only things which must be disclosed when selling a home are things which directly related to the condition of the home itself. Therefore, if they were to say bury the deceased under the living room, it would have to be disclosed since getting body in there and all the digging might conceivably have a permanent effect on the home. It is legally deemed a dead body that is properly removed for burial or cremation elsewhere does not give any cause to believe there might be some problem with the home at present or in future, so it doesn't have to be disclosed. I can say this appears to be true for the area I currently live in, which is well over 1,100 miles from the small town I am from.

So I'll try to provide some feedback of both my impression and the general public's feelings on the anime I list...

A few I recommend -

 [Azumanga Daioh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37mPoKQijj8) It's fairly old, from 2002 I think. It's the slice-of-life anime that started all of the following ones (K-ON, Lucky Star, etc...) but it's pretty funny and very wholesome. It follows the story of ~6 High School girls from their first year to their graduating year. It's just 26 episodes long and it's *fricking hilarious.* The whole premise of the show is actually aimed at boys, basically saying ""Girls are really weird."" It relies a lot of [everyday humor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WqfcUrcQQA) with shifts into [the absurd!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyiTsbiRUeY) and even a few shifts into [surrealism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBZBAbbKt8). It makes a lot of Japanese culture references and is funny in that... ""You had to be there"" ...kind of way you have with friends. Oh, also the three teachers you meet will do things to the students that would normally make national news in any country.

[Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWUI3pPrH3Y) - This show is what would happen if CardCaptor Sakura and Gundum Wing had a baby. It's about a 9 year old girl who becomes a mage. And instead of wangsting about, she kicks-ass and takes names. It's known for it's extremely elaborate [transformation sequences](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz-hiJBkWdw), fist-pumping aerial-battle scenes, and for having interesting/engaging characters in a good plot. There are two movies out that I highly recommend since they cut all the filler out.

[mahou shoujo madoka magica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARhHq-aw5DI) - an incredible deconstruction of the magical girl genre. It basically tears apart and pisses on every magical girl trope. It's incredibly emotionally intense and has a level of psychological fuck-uppery that can reach above and beyond Evangelion levels. It is incredibly well written with good music and a great cast of characters. Again, it is legendary for its complete [descontruction of the magical girl anime.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S09mEDCqSx4)

FLCL - An old school anime. It's about 11 years old at this point, but it's held up well. It was featured in America a long long time ago on Toonami. It is only 6 episodes long and[ is an amazing clusterfuck of awesome.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl14LjKysW0) I can't honestly say if there is a plot... I mean, there IS a plot, I think. I mean, I think I know what the plot is... I think... but I don't care, it's an amazing anime and it's 6 episodes of amazing long. Watch the vid I linked, the plot comes roaring in right around 3m30s...

As you can see, I dug back 11 or 12 years to find some of these, heh. So I think you'll like them. They're fairly time tested and there's a variety here from magical girl to mind fuckery to slice of life. Enjoy!!

Small problem...I'm in MiniMoon territory (been losing it with keto) and have very little upper body strength along with some pretty painful back problems from a car accident (0/10 - would not recommend). Using the crutches was seriously hurting my back so I decided I would just walk carefully and slowly. 

For some reason my family decided to go wander around Ikea yesterday. My fiance offered to grab a wheelchair for me since the store is so big. HFW I said I didn't want to look like a fat chick who didn't feel like walking through the store. -___-

screenmagnet,sex,1389620020.0,"Part of it is the psychological and visual turn on of a big penis.

Part of it is that if a guy's penis is too small, PIV sex (which he is going to want to do a lot, regardless of what other toys he introduces to the bedroom), is going to feel annoying. I would rather not have PIV than have PIV with a small or half hard penis. Having PIV with a penis that doesn't fill you up actually draws negative attention to how empty and dissatisfied your vagina feels.


Finally, a toy simply doesn't feel as good as a real penis, because a guy can thrust his penis much more accurately than he can thrust a toy. And it feels way more intimate as well."

FeverishFluidity,AskReddit,1389620306.0,"A coworker and I always bet each other to do really disgusting things.  One day he gave me his cup of tobacco spit and asked how much was it worth to take a big gulp of it.

I took the cup, swirled it around as it was a cabernet sauvignon, and said, ""$350.""

He said, ""Do it.""

I said, ""Let me see the money.""

He said, ""Let me go withdraw it.""

I said, ""Okay.""

About twenty minutes later, he shows me the roll of money.  I counted it and then he took it back with a smug grin on his stupid face.  I looked at him, grabbed the styrofoam cup with his black, smelly tobacco spit.  I could tell he dipped Copenhagen wintergreen.

He said, ""You won't do it.""

I said, ""Yes I will.""

He said, ""No you won't.""

I said, ""Follow me.""

A look of worry spread on his face, and he said, ""Ok.""

We walked to the bathroom.  I took the cup in my hand and immediately took a solid gulp, without hesitation, without fear.  The kind of gulp that bobs the adam's apple.  A little bit of it trickled down my chin.  He looked at me in horror.  I vomited in the toilet, then with tears of post-puking in my eyes, and a grin of triumph, I wiped my mouth, gave him back his cup, now half of what it was, snatched the money out of his hand, and walked out of the bathroom.

Another time, I also shot myself in the leg with a staple gun for a Coke."

Bulgaria's main export is electricity - mostly to Albania and Macedonia. We also export rose oil and bulgarian yoghurt (which is different and more delicious but is made only here because of a special bacteria). We export a lot of clothing to Italy, but can't really compare with the neighbours from Turkey.

People just want to stabilize their country...our country... We want to have working judicial system, uncorrupted politicians and MPs working for the people that voted for them. But modern young Bulgarian people are all into technology, business, music, pop culture. We got Spotify a month ago, so locals are slowly learning about the difference between pirated and legal music.

The friend had acted in both our interests and pushed the girl to tell me without doing so herself. She basically gave her time to do the right thing. The girl broke up with me but without telling me the real reason why. The friend told me later.

The result was pretty predictable. Had she not lied, I would've taken the breakup as just another unfortunate event and moved on without resentment. When I found out she lied to me, she became a different person in my eyes and stopped mattering to my life at all. It sounds harsh but I have a very hard time forgiving people who lie to me, especially in situations like mine where she clearly knew what was right and still didn't do it.

My friend, however, grew to become an even better person in my eyes. She handled the situation perfectly. When you're in her position, it's hard to decide what to do. You have to base your decision on the seriousness of the information. In my case it wasn't serious enough to warrant her telling me out of turn (and in the process ruining her own friendship with the girl), but not so serious that she should've stayed out of it altogether. Simply put she had good judgement and that is a great thing to have in a friend."

Turned out the apartments had just one big attic over top of the third floor apartments. Some guy had moved his stuff up in the attic when he knew he was about to be evicted. He'd gained access by placing a door in the top of the hall closet in his apartment, which happened to be the apartment above me.


Edit: So I tried looking to see if the news story about the attic guy might be around somewhere, even though it happened about 10 years before internet existed.

Before, you'd have one primary gun and one attachment (ignoring bling etc). So your shotgun was as good and versatile as IW/Treyarch wanted it to be, same for SMGs and AR/LMGs. Now the problem is that someone can specialise in a very narrow area to make themselves OP in that way.

For example, whereas before, the spas was the spas. It did the range the developers set it to and that's about it... Now you can use a shotgun, take off your tacticals and secondary, and instead use attachments to buff up a shotgun to a god gun. The disadvantage is that it obviously doesn't work in large spaces so well. But that just means that people don't go outside. So you just get snipers with supersnipers aiming down corridors, shotgunners camping indoors, a few LMGs proning with 0 recoil in the back of the map, and a couple ARs and SMGs actually playing the game in a way that's fun for other people to play against.

At the end of the day, they haven't lost anything, nor earnt but the experience in the hard way.

Please, enlight us. Tell us what would you do if you were NiP at the moment. Do you think Zorozero will ever commit the same mistake again? Would you replace him for other players for something that is not game related (lack of motivation, rusty skills, etc) just like a punishment? Because this is shooting your own foot, since you are changing one of the best, with experience with this team, for a new one, just because a mistake which CANNOT be fixed. Is not like you are losing matches because he has rusty skills, cause you could replace him and this would fix something. This cannot be fixed AT ALL.

It is easy to speak and say ""Something should change"" but it is not that easy to say what you think they should change.

Yes, the broadcasters pay a ton of money to the NFL for the rights to show the games, and in turn they charge high rates for advertising because it's a sort of captive, DVR-less audience.

So, I get your story and all, but your advice is super not helpful in this case. Actively harmful, in fact.

Fuck that. We, as people, have the right to be ourselves when we choose. If ops parents are uncomfortable with their child being trans (and that can be a big if), that's their problem. Op can always find ways around that, and find ways to express themself.

Drunken_Black_Belt,books,1389621922.0,"I don't know if that is the reason tbh.  Granted I don't really agree with the original sentements here, as I quite enjoy King's books, including the endings. For example, I think the ending to the Dark Tower series is one of the best examples of his work.  

That being said,  I think it's a lot of the same issues that M Night Shamalan (spelling?) suffered from.  After the Sixth Sense, everyone expected his movies to have some huge twist.  And because of that, the audience was invariably let down.  Either they didn't get a twist ending and were dissapointed, or they did, but it wasn't as great as they were expecting.  

While I don't think King's writing suffers as much from this, I think people often know what to expect, and become a bit jaded about the endings.  No one wants him to write a happy ending, but they don't want the expected shock ending either.

Black people make up 20% or so of the US population so the US was long overdue for a black president. Women make up 50% so are even more overdue for a shot. Having a female president suggests German's are less prejudice against women.

Latino's as you call them, also make up a large part of the population, in Germany that isn't the case. Although in most of europe ""Latino's"" are simply other europeans rather than being seen as separate. However, looking at the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Germany#Population) page we can see that only 3.6% of Germans, at most, are from the equivalent parts of europe (Spain, italy, Greece, Cyprus).

When I was 11 i looked up 'naked women"" on my mums computer. I didn't jerk off as I didn't know how at this point. I just looked at a few pictures of naked women and thats about it. But to me this was a huge deal and I felt dirty about it and guilty for betraying my mums trust. 

I then found out that if my mum was found with porn on her computer, she'd lose her job. At the time I didn't know how to delete internet history... or realise that the thing I looked at wasn't REALLY porn. for months this ate away at me. I was so worried I'd be caught and have to explain to everyone that I looked at the porn so that she wouldn't lose her job... I was young and stupid. 

I was truly paranoid. Every time I'd be called to the office at school I'd think it was because they found out. Every time my mum said ""Come here, i need to talk to you"" my heart would go into my throat, just expecting her to tell me she knows.

If you've already told your grandparents, ask for their support. See if they might be willing to help you have a chat with your mother. Go from there, you know?

The second blame is placed ever for any reason, someone is going to get defensive. You're accusing him (or he is accusing you) of being wrong. Doing something wrong. It makes the accusing party more angry/upset and the blamed party also defensive/angry/upset. 

Arguments or disagreements should be viewed as ""how can we fix this?"" Obviously not every problem has a simple solution, but viewing tense situations as something to fix *together* will greatly benefit the health of your relationship. 

As for him disappearing, that's how some people deal with stress. He's taking time to cool down because he's emotional. That's actually healthy in a relationship. Rather than saying something he may regret later, he's giving the argument a little space and putting the brakes on his anger. If you're the type that just wants to talk everything out until it's done, you may try writing down what it is you want to say at this point.

India - 2010, I had a bad case of Dehli Belly but as I'd been safe for a few days and was rehydrating myself I thought I was doing alright on the solid poo front. Wrong. Was in my room (thankfully roomies were at work) and did a little fart thinking all was good in the world. Sharted. No paper in the bathroom, had to shower quickly (water shortage, was NOT supposed to be using the showers).

Nicaragua - 2013. Living with a family in a remote mountainous village. No electricity, no indoor toilet, outdoor toilet was flooded. I'd been having cramps but it was the middle of the night and stupidly chose to ignore them. Ended up rushing outside, realised about the flooded toilet, ran into the bushes, got my bottom half out (just) and shit myself. Then the family dogs came and ate it all. It was foul. "

TIGit,Automate,1389622984.0,"- I kept hearing ""Robots! Robots are coming!"" From all my college educated asshole friends. Despite that I was gainfully employed at $120+k a year as a pipe liner and they were unemployed. So since I heard it from everyone I took heed, despite my distaste, it's like the village parable:

&gt; A traveler walks through a strange land and comes across a village. As he walks through the village a man approaches him and warns him of man eating trolls in the woods. The traveler scoffs, ""Trolls do not exist!"" And continues walking on. Later another man stops the traveler and warns him dangerous werewolves live in the woods. The traveler again scoff a, ""Village foolery! There is no such thing as werewolves!"" The traveler gets closer to the woods and yet another villager stops him warning him of a dragon who lives in the woods and eats men who go into the woods. The traveler waves him off and enters the woods. Along the path in the middle of the woods he is attacked and killed by a band of robbers. If every single person warns you of the same danger, it is always worthy of caution.

So as I was getting ready to leave the pipeline and make my way back to my heavily industrial hometown I researched the robots that were set to take my job, supposedly. But it wasn't robots, it was automation that was truly overarching. That was my ""writing on the wall"". I was already a highly skilled welder, why not expand my skills to new rapidly advancing areas? I wanted a broader range of skills so that I could go anywhere and be in demand. I could always go back to being a welder if I didn't like CNC/CMM/G-Code/modeling/building systems. So I had a safety net backup plan, and thought ""Why not?"" I love new challenges and adventure, it's one of the reasons I ran out to the wild pipelines. I wanted to learn more, I wanted to expand my knowledge, and I wanted options. If I wanted to go back to welding that was an option, if I wanted to do CNC machining that was an option, if I wanted to design automation systems and install machines that would be yet another option. I never want to be backed in a corner living in fear that I'm a one trick pony.

- The other welders are still happily employed as welders. It wasn't that the work place I was in changed so much as I changed and moved on. My fellows are still happy with their jobs and are still in great demand. They didn't do what I did because many of them dedicated decades to their one true love- welding. To forsake one's lifelong passion, something they'd spent tens of thousands of hours mastering? It's hard. They'd invested so much time, they'd gotten old. New skills are challenging, the unknown is scary, and we are all creatures of comfort we stick to what we know. They were also years out of the school system, and it's true, if you don't use it you lose it. There's a great challenge in learning very foreign concepts and relearning old things like maths.

It's not so much ""old people are afraid of computers"" as it is ""people who have focused on a very specific thing for a very long time often don't like to change into something foreign and vastly different"". For min stance you're in software development, why don't you quit your job right now and become an underwater welder? $500k a year, world travel, full benefits. You won't leap to do that, you've spent a lot of time and energy developing your skill in software, you've mastered your craft, why jump into unknowns and take on risks?

- As for seeing the writing on the wall, people are often blind to their own troubles but fast to point out the flaws in others. Those college friends who said ""Robots are coming for your job!"" were dumped in a terrible economy and found their degrees hat they'd worked hard for didn't land them their dream jobs, or any job. Why would unemployed people repeatedly tell me about dangers to my own job while bragging of their own degrees and job prospects? It was bizarre. But they had committed years to those degrees and they were not ready to admit that they may have made a mistake or that they needed to change themselves and hit the ground running, it was so much easier to say ""TIGit, the robots are coming!"" rather than say ""TIGit, why am I still unemployed after getting my Master's in Architecture?"" It's willful blindness, it's cognitive bias, it's hopefulness, and it's very human."

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1389623056.0,"&gt; How do we go forward addressing gender issues without allowing religious freedom to ferment hate?

IMO A person A can ask not to do X because it violates their religion. But that same person A cannot ask person B to change their habits. However I think there are limits and consequences to what they can ask, depending what the dominant religion is in the country they are in. The rights of person B should not be infringed upon. 
For example, person A (male) may ask not to be partnered with a woman in a college lab class. But person A cannot force women in the class to wear/not wear certain clothing. But if person A does not do the labs (because they skip them altogether) they should not pass the class (or lab portion). 

Another example, if I were to live in Saudi Arabia I have to follow their cultural rules and laws. If I am required to wear their clothing, I don't mind wearing their clothing. But I protest being forced to stone someone to death. 

I have an American friend working in Saudi right now. They have whole cities devoted to housing western workers, with western culture, dress, etc. If you are in the city you can buy beer, alcohol, watch the cinema, dress how you want. But if you go outside the city, you have to follow the local customs, and it's easier not to draw attention to yourself if you dress with their mode of dress.

bubbish,AskMen,1389623346.0,"&gt; The majority of women I've met who've had a high partner count over the years have had a lot of issues though so that is making me lean towards trying to avoid them.

I will admit to projecting a little. Personally, I don't concern myself with appearing promiscuous because I know I am able to keep it in my pants when it counts. That doesn't mean that other people will do the same.

What you said up there reminded me of a friend who has these issues. She uses random hookups as an escape from other issues and she is painfully aware of this. I can even tell when she's about to do it, after having seen the process a few times. If I'm going to be totally honest, I wouldn't recommend her to a good friend because of *why* she acts the way she does.

In light of the fact that people like this exist, I will concede that concern over past promiscuity is valid. But do you think it's worth avoiding someone altogether because of it? When, if ever at all, do you think that it is worth taking the risk of being with someone you like despite past issues of this sort?"

Casters have a certain number of spell points (based on their level and how they have developed their skills).  Casters then use these spell points to cast any spell they know and they can afford.  So, if Murlynd the Magician has 24 spell points, he can cast two twelfth level spells that day or six fourth level spells, or any other combination that does not exceed 24 points for the day.  

It's a very different approach, and one that my group prefers.  We tried other games, including 3.5, Pathfinder, HERO and FantasyCraft, but we have come back to Rolemaster and I doubt we will ever use any other system."

* 3) do this at least 4 weeks before the closing date

* 4) The final and most important part. message the previous entrants saying you have done the upload and that you want them to go check it out. This way you can say that A) your guess is prior to the close B) all entrants had the opportunity to nay say your application C) if you do win then there are X number of witnesses to say that your claim is legit and your guess was WAY before the close.

TBH this way you have LESS of a chance to win as the swing on the spot is so wide but it allows you to have a bit of fun.

ctesibius,talesfromtechsupport,1389623589.0,"Small war story. Back in the late 80's I was working in a lab, and I assembled what would have been one of the earliest digital cameras. I say ""assembled"", because although there was quite a bit of design work, the sensor (a Peltier-cooled imaging photon detector) already existed. This was recorded individual photon events, with an effective resolution of about 400x400. I'm not sure how you would calculate the ISO, but it would be up in the millions.

The output of this thing was a stream of X-Y coordinates which had to be built into an image in real time. I needed a flat memory space of more than 64kB, so that meant using one of a 32-bit operating systems. At the time, only OS/2 1.0 was suitable: this was quite a while before IBM and Microsoft split, so WinNT didn't exist, and Unix was not a real-time OS. I built my own interface boards, so device drivers were not an issue.

The trouble was that a 25Mhz 80386 wasn't fast enough, even in assembler, so I did some of the bit-bashing to put the data into a useful format using wire-wrap boards, all stuffed in to a box. This format was very specific to OS/2 1.0 because the global and local descriptor tables had 8-byte entries, changed to 16 bytes on later versions (exactly why this mattered escapes me now, but go with the flow).

Anyway, it all worked in a steam-powered fashion. I had to implement a GUI as OS/2 1.0 didn't implement Presentation Manager (the equivalent of the Windows GUI), and I was limited to 32Mb disk partitions. Yep, that's not a mis-print.

When I left, every three years a new generation of students would come in, and I'd get a phone call about this clunky old relic that some idiot had bolted together, and how they were going to update it to a nice new operating system with a proper GUI and support for big disks. I'd then explain how they were going to have to rewire the wire-wrap for the new memory map. They would then undo the six screws on top of the box labelled ""quantum differential phase inducer"", at which point a mass of grey spaghetti would spring out. Two hours later, they might have succeeded in getting the lid back on the damn thing, and the correspondence would cease because they decided an update just wasn't worth the hassle.

If I'm home, I add a thin layer of pure aloe gel to the glans before closing the foreskin. This ensures fully hydration, making the foreskin longer, softer, and less in need of a wash so soon. It also helps the membrane repel urine, so the next rinse comes clean.

If I'm away from my aloe supply, I stretch the foreskin out like a test tube, fill it with water from the shower, then let go. No drying, of course.

silverionmox,europe,1389624067.0,"&gt; They're having undemocratic decision processes in order to stay in the EU. Democracy is good, except when it comes to the EU.

That's completely up to them to decide. If their internal democratic feedback mechanisms were okay and they disagreed, they would stop the train in five minutes. It's the typical bait-and-switch: blaming the EU for what national governments do wrong.

&gt;You can always put a minimum turnout threshold, that's what they do in Uruguay and democracy's far better from it.

No. Referendums have their place, but they're not a universal solvent. It's up to the individual countries to decide anyway. Again, their choice, not the EU's. The EU has *no power at all* to force them to abstain from referenda.

&gt;Not if the people refuse said 'law' before. The Lisbon Treaty ratification is as legitimate as the amount of legitimacy MPs granted to the peoples' choice expressed earlier via referendum, which is none.
The persons in this subreddit are really the only one defending this farce.

Then how do you explain that all these people become reelected? Why didn't you protest beforehand? You all thought it was going to be alright so it wasn't worth sacrificing your free time for.. and now you're crying lack of democracy. Truth is, you were too complacent to exercise your democratic rights if you even disagreed at all back then.

&gt;The adjustment was done in response to trade deficits. Following your logic, when trade deficits occur again, wages would need to go down again as well.

Basic supply and demand.

&gt;Which option is less painful, considering that:

Price and wage reductions need only to happen once, so I prefer that. I would also prefer to provide more cushioning to help the readjustment, but sovereignity fanatics are blocking measures like that.

&gt;the price of a product doesn't necessarily go up by raising wages
thanks to the European treaties, it's forbidden to restrict capital movement within the EU and between the EU and third countries, this puts you in direct competition with countries who do not have the same industrial structure, economic, social, environment, worker protection policies as you (looking at you China). It's a race to the bottom.

I have no idea what you're intending to use this blurb for.

&gt;Well you're not the only one thinking that...for now. When your country is bankrupt because it needed to go in debt to save another failing country (as it happened with Italy), you're looking at a house of cards. The Germans will end up having to pay for everyone, they understandbly cannot accept this situation, and this is why they plan on letting the euro-area explode.

The ECB is the lender of last resort now. And like any central bank, it creates liquidity out of thin air. The chance for the eurozone to explode is long past. I'm sorry to tell you.

&gt;It makes no sense for Germany and Greece (for example) to share the same currency.

Assertion. It doesn't make sense for Montana and New York either, but still it works. It doesn't make sense for Wales and London, but still it works. A currency is a policy tool, not an economic derivative.

&gt;Regarded by whom is the good question. Before the European treaties, a country had the option to check what capital tries to go out. It could be allowed if it was in the interest of the country, but this also meant that if a government decided it had to devalue, the rich were trapped. 

Ha ha ha ha :) Seriously, do you believe that capital is, or was, restricted by borders? *Especially* in the Mediterranean,  the wealthy were sure to invest their money in local real estate and keep their liquidity in for example a Swiss bank account or the Cayman islands.

&gt;Doesn't this prove that countries who need to devaluate from time to time should not share the same currency with countries who abhor devaluation ?

It just proves that devaluation doesn't cure anything. Believing that devaluations are inevitable in the Mediterranean is questionably essentialist thinking. They too are able to change policies.

&gt;OK then. Politicians(and peoples they're supposed to serve) from Scotland to Cyprus and from Finland to Portugal are the same. /s

Yes, as we can see the currency union of the UK, with three kingdoms and a bunch of colonies has kept failing at least three times per century /s

Quite the opposite. Germany cannot accept devaluation for historical reasons, the French turn to the state since the 12th century when there's a problem so they won't accept to dismantle their strong public service, Netherlands won't accept free-trade restrictions, the UK won't accept measures that would harm its financial sector, Luxembourg and Austria won't abandon their tax-heaven status, Eastern Europe won't accept higher wages as there would be no reason to delocalize anymore...see where I'm going ?

Sounds exactly like any parliament ever.

&gt;The Earth will as well, what's your point

That failure rates are irrelevant.

&gt;Look at my comment to see what currencies stood the test of time, how long some of them weren't used as they were transplanted by supranational currencies, and how they inevitably returned despite being eclipsed by sometimes up to millenia. It's very improbable the euro will go on.

It's very improbably you will live to be hundred, but still you'll go to the doctor if you feel ill. If you want to break it down, say when, how and who will clean up the mess.

&gt;Not in the trouble Europe is in at the moment.

As I said, they had less tools to their disposal due to the sovereignity fundamentalists and austerity fanatics.

&gt;That's what the press tells you. None of it will solve the underlying problems caused by sharing a currency with 18 coutries with diametrically opposed needs and interests to the detrimant of democracy.

The press more often than not is on the same bandwagon of doom that you are on, currently."

SquidFistHK,IAmA,1389624130.0,"&gt; anything TSA tries to implement will probably be seen with scorn and mistrust anyway

You have a point as the public's opinion of the TSA is largely negative. And the culture of security in Israel is far different from the USA (if you're in Bangkok, check out El-Al's check-in counter...they're clearly playing by their own rules).

It may be a long road, but start with the training and improving the general quality of frontline staff. If people are treated courteously and efficiently they WILL notice. It will take time, but if queues are speeded up and TSA staff behave more politely (there will always be ""little Napoleons"" in any uniformed job, but that's what HR is for), you'll hear less vitriol directed against the TSA. Change is possible, but it takes work.

We got off to a bad start in the wake of 9/11 and the formation of new federal bureaucracies with the constant tiresome excuse of ""terr'rism"" leading to bad policies, like the Chertoff scan-machines. But things can always be improved. Again, learning from the best practices of other countries which have more decades of experience dealing with genuine threats regarding airport security is a plus. The UK, Israel...what can the TSA borrow and adapt?

1. The orgasm does not always matter. Sometimes the intimacy is enough. Don't force the orgasm. 
1. Since he may last forever, if you're so sore you have to stop, say that. 
2. ""Recharging"" for a new erection or orgasm takes longer. It may take 24 hours for a new erection without ED meds. Don't assume it's your fault. Educate yourself. 
2. ED can be  a problem, especially since many Americans have such an awful diet and are out of shape. 
He might need an ED pill. He should be open to try this. 
3. He might be more kinkier now. Ask him about his kinks and NEVER make fun of them or make an ""eww"" face. I'm just warning you, things might get real kinky. 
4. NEVER put your finger in his bum without asking first. Not all guys want that.

Maybe it will become stale, maybe the amount of lore and detail that makes a slow crawl through Skyrim appealing won't be established for whatever reason. I'm sure there's other valid arguments to make against the game, there's flaws to be found. 

Inspite of this, in the few hours that I've experienced it.  ESO has brought me far more enjoyment than many other MMO's, including the icon World of Warcraft.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1389624739.0,"I dunno that this is true. I agree that it's likely the Elves were ""meant"" to exist independently of the Valar at least until the end of the First Age, but the fact is that everything serves Iluvatar's greater plan, and even mistakes and outright evil serve to demonstrate His wisdom. Their home is in Valinor, as shown by Iluvatar's preservation of the Straight Way. The Vanyar and Teleri would've suffered greatly under Morgoth had they not been called to Valinor. Valmar itself has been greatly served by the presence of the Elves and their creativity. Elves in Valinor are reunited with their loved ones after reincarnation, which is apparently an occasion of mutual joy. The Vanyar provided the army that defeated Morgoth. The list of benefits goes on.

Now, that's not to say that, without Morgoth, I disagree. Lots of bad stuff happened because the Valar brought the Elves to Valinor. But given the fallen state of the world, I think this is a situation where it is the best possible outcome.

ctesibius,Ubuntu,1389624801.0,"Just some context for this. GCHQ has responsibility for spying on communications, but this is from a different part which is responsible for securing UK govt and public sector IT and comms. Until recently they have relied on testing systems and approving them, but this takes so long that things like smartphones are off the market before they can be approved. Hence they are moving to a more open process where they just try to outline the risks of a platform, and leave it up to the department purchaser as to whether to accept them. This is basically for work at OFFICIAL level - the lowest level of classification in the new system. 

An obvious question is whether their recommendations contain anything that would make the systems vulnerable to penetration by GCHQ. Other than a fondness for elliptic curve cryptography, I don't think so. There are advantage for the elliptic curve stuff, but I'm a little concerned that the standards specify which curve to use without giving detail as to why that one was chosen (a standard would have to specify this in any case as not every curve would work)."

I am just so amazed that you would try to tell her to stop going to a bar like that. So vindictive, especially for such a short term thing. And you said you texted all that to her? That would be strange for her and she probably feels she dodged a bullet now. 

Maybe try dating some new people and practice classier communication methods so that you don't continue to repeat that faux pas in the future.

silverionmox,Economics,1389624819.0,"&gt; Okay if its about redistribution advocate a negative income tax

That could work too, I'm not rooting for one specific solution.

&gt; its about an ideology that inequality is bad

Inequality has numerous, measurable negative effects on the whole of society.

&gt;that taking from the rich and giving to the poor is good, as long as we're not talking about the kind of wealth redistribution that would involve taxing things like computers and smart phones from you so that people in the 3rd world can have water that won't kill them. Only the kind of wealth distribution that involves taking from the top 0.1% and giving it to those in top 15% is good.

It's a nice start. They can have my nonexistent smartphone and If you know a nice charity that can reliably ship my two outdated computers to someone who needs them, I'm all ears. Let's begin with doing it in democratically accountable polities. I'm very sorry we don't have colonies anymore.

&gt;Umm... no. What you're arguing for is to say that millions of people are basically economically worthless

Yes, they are, economically. Capital is usually more productive, and insisting that they work for money just artificially depresses the price of labor, leading to pointless jobs like telemarketeers, grocery bagges and walmart greeters. Of course there's a lot of work to be done, but that's for diffuse benefits and commercial enterprises don't pay for that.

&gt;You keep talking about the minimum wage like its the main factor in setting wages.

If it isn't, why not raise it then? It sets a price floor.

&gt;most of them are young people who won't be earning it for very long so its not a long term plan for these people to slightly increase the minimum wage.

They should be studying then, instead of asking each other whether they want fries with that. There's enough unemployment left.

&gt;but it would cause a vast amount of disturbances in the labor market that would only hurt poor people.

I thought you said repeatedly that the minimum wage has basically no effect?

wufoo2,sex,1389625130.0,"It's the subtle touches that work. He has 50 percent more nerve endings than a cut guy (they're in the foreskin) and a smooth, supple glans that gives him a much wider range of sensations.

What this means for you is improved ROI: Less labor for you, more enjoyment for him.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in your lips. You know how good it feels when you're kissing and your guy manipulates your lips with his lips and tongue? It's the same when your lips and tongue work on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin with your hand stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans then rolling it closed again. Bonus: When it's closed, slide your tongue in between the foreskin and glans. Swirl. You may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture will make your fingers feel like erasers.

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised strip connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation. (I think it's key to triggering orgasm during sex.) Don't go right to it, though. Save it for the finish."

IAMTHEDEATHMACHINE,TheRedPill,1389625224.0,"I'm white and I've dated four black girls. Two were American, one a smoking hot college athlete and one was a studious bookworm. Two were foreign, one German/Nigerian, one full Nigerian (Igbo, to be specific). 

All were very attractive, but in order from most feminine to least feminine, it went like this: Nigerian, German/Nigerian, bookworm, athlete.

The worst by far was the American athlete. She seemed very similar to the sister in the top comment from OP's link. Hell, the only reason I knew she was attractive to begin with is because I saw her in tights at track practice. Otherwise, I never would have seen through the sweats, basketball shoes, and hats.

Then there are also ways to get the payments adjusted based on your income, so if you're making very little with your expensive degree, it won't bankrupt you.

Your analogy is interesting and has given some food for thought.

wufoo2,sex,1389625724.0,"It's the subtle touches that work. He has 50 percent more nerve endings than a cut guy (they're in the foreskin) and a smooth, supple glans that gives him a much wider range of sensations.

What this means for you is improved ROI: Less labor for you, more enjoyment for him.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in your lips. You know how good it feels when you're kissing and your guy manipulates your lips with his lips and tongue? It's the same when your lips and tongue work on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin with your hand stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans then rolling it closed again. Bonus: When it's closed, slide your tongue in between the foreskin and glans. Swirl. You may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. (It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture will make your fingers feel like erasers.)

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised strip connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation. (I think it's key to triggering orgasm during sex.) Don't go right to it, though. Save it for the finish.


You didn't ask about hygiene, but I'll address it. Just as you wouldn't want a guy going down on you unless you were fresh, he might be self-conscious as well. Intact males aren't gross, but if more than a few hours have passed since his last shower, or he's urinated recently, there might be some residual taste. That's up to you to flag him. Don't feel bad asking him to freshen up with a rinse, and tell him not to soap. Soap dries out the glans and inner foreskin, causing bad smell when they absorb urine. Water only, and never dry the glans."

For example, the place I'm working this semester- I got it because I reached out to an alum of my law school who works full time for them. And I dropped the question on him as well. He said I didn't actually HAVE to stick out all 3 years of law school, but it helped him and would help me too.

As for taking a leave of absence... it sounds tempting, but if I'm going to stick it out, I'd much rather get it over with sooner than later.

As for your last questions... it's tough to say. I will say that after having taken professional responsibility, the legal profession seems depressing to me and I don't have much interest in working for a firm this coming summer. I worked for a judge last semester, which I enjoyed to an extent, and I was signed up for a clinic this semester but chose to drop it so I could take this job I currently have. I wouldn't have been able to do both.

1866 RAM is not really any better than 1600 or even 1333 RAM in an intel build with a discrete graphics card. The only time RAM speed really matters these days is with AMD APUs. Intel integrated graphics are so weak, even if you used it, RAM speed is unimportant. I bet you can find a 1600 MHz set for less than $85, get whatever you can find that is the cheapest at 1600MHz, 1.5V and 9-9-9-24 timings. 

quick edit: there are some even cheaper motherboards for 1150 socket, but the H81 (cheapest) chipset only supports 2 ram slots instead of 4, and only has 2 SATA III plugs instead of 4. Also H81 only has PCI-e 2.0 rather than 3.0 The B85 chipset is definitely worth the extra $15 or so. "

Hopefully they can find some evidence against this scumbag (but since you waited, it may not be as open-and-shut). Once you have filed the police report, *then* go to your father. Let the law start its often slow process before anything else. As others have mentioned, no matter how your father thinks of women in general, or how important his players and job are to him, I would say 90%+ of guys would put their children, especially their daughter, before any of those beliefs. Men both socially, and to some degree instincually are drawn to protect their families, especially their offspring. It's easy for a man whose job is tied to the success of his players to take their side when the victim is some nameless, faceless statistic. It is a completely different story when it's your own flesh and blood. Suddenly, that cognitive dissonance and rationalization becomes impossible. I would bet good money your dad will take your side.

As for the school administration, you raise a good point. This could put your reputation and you father's job in jeopardy. It's a cold, hard fact of our society. Like you said, though, the idea is about preventing this from happening to someone else. You know the risks involved, but you also know the right thing to do. Perusing justice may not be the easiest route in the short term, but it is the best way to stop this guy from raping again, and also is the only way you can hope to get any closure in your life.

If you watch closely the bottom sheet  of plywood goes first, as if it was only tacked in place, it looks like that caused a chain reaction.

Seperate story: On a building we built a couple years ago part of the roof pulled off in a freak updraft, it left half of the roof, from a center smoke wall on, in tact. The roof had picked itself up and sailed over top of the other roof section and 100' guy wires attached to the silo's nearby and landed in a field 1km away. 

It was determined by inspectors that no one was at fault and rebuilt with almost exactly the same specs as in the first place, except for adding a few more hurricane clips.

However, you rarely get that fed (at least in higher elo), and when you do, your team will generally win no matter what you build.  

Getting Mejai's on someone like Lux when you can play very safe and keep your stacks can also be decent, although when you get the Mejai's, you tend to get focused (which you can also use to get people to focus you when someone else may be a bigger threat).

Esotericgirl,relationships,1389626345.0,"Your post states that you told your boyfriend about the gift, which is awesome. It doesn't, however, state that you told your boyfriend about the *dinner* which was the *price* of the gift...  

So, saying he was cool with the gift itself doesn't truly tell us what his feelings were/would be including the information about the date your co-worker asked for in return.  

Did you tell him about that, as well?  

I think he may have reacted differently if so, and asked you to return the gift - as it is carrying an assumption of reciprocation. The kind of reciprocation your co-worker wants in return is not the kind that someone in a committed relationship should be giving (as you know that even an ""innocent"" dinner with him would leave him wanting more).

If you have *not* yet told him about this stipulation, you should IMO.       

The only way I see of getting out of this with the gift (you seem to *not* want to return it, based on the comments I'm reading - though I'm sure I could be misreading your intentions) and not putting your relationship in a potentially bad situation would be to tell your co-worker ""Sure! &lt;boyfriend's name&gt; and I will meet you at &lt;restaurant name&gt; on &lt;date&gt; at &lt;time&gt;. We'll treat! And thank you again for such a thoughtful gift, it's greatly appreciated!"" 

If you choose this option, you include your boyfriend in the reciprocation process and cut off any inclination co-worker dude may have had to put the moves on you. However, if you do this, you are still leaving it open for him to continue to give gifts to you in the future, if he somehow doesn't get uncomfortable enough with your triad date to stop doing that. 

If you don't want him to give you more gifts after the above scenario, you need to tell him not to. Point blank.  

Other than that, the option is to return the gift, continue to avoid outside social interactions with your co-worker, and tell him that you enjoy his company as a co-worker but feel that meeting up outside of work or giving each other gifts takes things to a realm where you aren't comfortable.

Either way, you should tell him you aren't ok with accepting gifts/more gifts from him. There's no real way of saying this other than just saying it. The truth is powerful, and outright saying that you don't feel comfortable receiving gifts from another guy while you're in a committed relationship *can* work wonders. It's not a ""confrontation"" as much as it is a simple, yet powerful, comment.

TheMeerkat,movies,1389626382.0,"If you've been gaming for a small while, though, it's easy to look at most of those screencaps and point out each individual effect used, and it's usually overdone -- a lot of modern games have far too much lighting focus, and Battlefield 4 (hell, Battlefield 3 too) is one of the defining examples of that.

When you look at The Incredibles, it's cartoony, obviously, but if that were a real universe somewhere, you get the impression that that's exactly what it would look like. No effect is out of place or draws too much attention to itself. It would be difficult to point out the lighting, or physics, or whatever in any one scene and ""isolate"" it. Battlefield 4 is *trying* to look like real life with more explosions, but you can basically see the building blocks the engine is using, and it ends up as more of a facsimile.

Even in Frozen, where the snow had a **ton** of work put into it, it still all flows together seamlessly because that's just how we know snow looks and acts. Compare it to a game like Cryostasis, which has the best ice effects of any game ever released but still can't come close to matching it for realism.

Unrepentant_Priapist,linux,1389626500.0,"You don't need to benchmark this.  A 7200 RPM SATA disk can handle roughly 75 IOPS, so four of them can theoretically handle 300 IOPS.

Under an average server workload, your disks can handle roughly 200 IOPS, + or - 25 IOPS.

That number is likely accurate enough for capacity planning purposes, but if you would like to refine it a bit, you can use a utility like iostat to determine your read and write percentages if you don't already know them."

Computers, my first computer was a twelve pound Dell laptop with the processing power of a walnut and the internet speed of a slug. I currently own a Lenovo Laptop (piece of junk) with more processing power than four of my old laptops and internet speed to match. Furthermore, my first gaming system was a Nintendo Gamecube which I played on one of the TVs that look like a box. I currently play on a PS3 on a flatscreen TV that was priced at roughly an equivalent amount to my old TV, and my PS3 roughly twice as much as the original Gamecube, with easily three or four times better graphics and gaming. 

Video, I grew up watching VHS tapes of Winnie the Poo. Currently I can live stream HD movies to my laptop. Things like Netflix when I was younger just weren't possible.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389626637.0,"&gt; I spend days alone playing video games or watching Netflix, and other days with my boyfriend. I don't hang out or talk to much of anyone else anymore. I'm a dud. A boring, lonely, friendless dud.

This is your problem right here. Making friends is a lot like dating - you're going to need to put some effort into it. I don't think you should ""get over"" being friendless and just accept it - that's not healthy. Look what it's doing to your relationship: you've only been together four months and you're messaging him because he's not responding to your texts quickly enough? He's going to feel smothered pretty quickly. Your boyfriend *should not* always be available to feed your attention. You don't have a spark not because of some innate personality defect or part of your nature, but because you don't have anything going on in your life that's exciting. 

So what do you do? The first thing you need to do is start leaving the house. *This is non-negotiable*. How you do it depends on what works best for you - my go-to suggestion is always an exercise class of some sort. Since you want to meet women, try yoga. This has the benefit of both getting you active physically, which should help you feel better, and giving you a platform to meet more people. I know money can be an issue, but seriously, find it somewhere. Cancel your netflix subscription if you have to. My studio offers 3 different $6 classes a week, so in theory you could go to two classes a week for just $12. It's worth it. I know this depends on where you live, but if you put a little effort into it, you'll find something that meets your budget. 

Second, try volunteering. Do a little searching and see if there are opportunities that would interest you - most charities have some sort of outreach program you can work with. Remember you're not limited to food banks - you can volunteer with the American Cancer Society, with local animal shelters, community clean-up programs, all kinds of things.

Finally, make yourself into a person who has something to say. Read one book a week on whatever interests you - fiction, non-fiction, novels, romance, whatever. Look over the news each day and educate yourself on topics that seem important to you. Read one wikipedia article a day. This is crucial if it takes you a long time to open up to people. To make friends, you need to have something to talk about. If you're not going to talk about yourself, make sure you have another topic. Also be sure you're asking potential friend a lot of questions about herself - that will help too.

Stop waiting for people to contact you. All those people you're missing? Plan a get-together at a local pub or bar or something (this will be most cost-efficient - you can buy one drink and nurse it all night if money is tight. Remember the point is not to drink but to bring people together.). *Encourage everyone who comes to the event to bring a friend or two*. Bill the get-together not as old friends meeting up, which might discourage people from bringing new people in, but as a place to meet new people. Use the network of friends you do have to widen your potential social circle.

Above all, get out of the house.

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389626661.0,"&gt; Not sure, but Mortgage's by default are secured right?

Depends on how you define 'default'. Yes mortgages are often secured loans and odds are it was. But any loan could be called a mortgage. We aren't talking about what is says on legal documents after all. Any discussion in the family will simply call it a mortgage regardless how it was really structured. The details of the agreement matter. It could have been anything really. The fact it was a loan taken out in one person's name but not the other seems like it might not be secured by that asset or not secured at all.

Your FiL being the executor will work against you. If someone else was the executor then it would be more difficult for the bank to take legal action. There's a few points working here- when you die, your debts die with you *net of your estate*. The question becomes if that loan transferred to your FiL or not. It may not have been legal for her to use the house as security without his consent in the first place. The house could be part of the estate or not part of the estate when it transferred to your FiL.

Still my best guess on what to do is the same as above- ask for all info. Then tell the bank, no the loan died with her and inform them you don't owe them anything. Then see what the bank does. When they object immediately inform them the payments will continue but are going into trust and actually do that. (It's a power play on your part and guts a lot of bullshit they can pull.)

It comes down to cost-benefit for the bank then. If they've got a really strong case for no effort then they'll fight. If they feel they've got a weak case and that will take a lot of effort (aka lawyer's fees) then it won't be worth it. They'll lose money even if they win. They'll cut their loses early as not to send good money after bad. (Assuming they are competent which from stories I've heard about big US banks like BoA probably won't be true.)

BTW mortgage insurance protects the bank, not you. It's [smart to not have mortgage insurance](http://lsminsurance.ca/mortgage-life-insurance) as it's just a cost to you with no real benefit... especially if you are dead."

The argument that no person should earn a wage inferior to a certain amount is a deontological argument. It's morally abject that a certain people cannot earn a living wage. Insufficient wages imposes a cost on human dignity, which should no be tolerated. On the other hand, the case against the minimum wage is a consequentialist argument. It's morally abject to worsen the economic situation of others, just so your aesthetic concerns can be addressed. 

It's a debate similar to the debate of rehabilitation versus punishment, with regards to prison, where one camp is more concerned by the ends whereas the other camp is more concerned by the means. In both cases, the decision is informed by a moral framework."
novapine,relationship_advice,1389626719.0,"When me and my bf had a slump in him not being able to come, all his guy friends suggested to him to cut down or stop masturbating all together and it did the trick. He did it for both of us because neither of us liked that he couldn't get off during sex. He didn't blame me or turn it around. He fixed the problem all on is own.

With the not getting you off, I disagree with where hes coming from. The only time I had a guy not give a shit about getting me off is when I had a one night stand. Its not a difficult thing to do and all he has to do is listen to you when you tell him how to get you off. We aren't complicated and I assume its easy for you to come with the right stimulation? My boyfriend, even when hes worked 8 hours or ran around all day has said numerous times that if hes awake enough to have sex, hes awake enough to finish. There have only been a few times when I didn't ask him to finish getting me off but more times than not, he is ready and willing and wants to get me off too. Its satisfying for both of us to get each other off.

I dont know your dynamic but it sounds like hes one of those very, very selfish partners who likes getting but not giving and that is completely unfair to you. If I were in your position, i'd cut him off entirely. He can have his hand 24\7."

Borror0,CanadaPolitics,1389626914.0,"Why on Earth would the Bank care how high or low the dollar is? It has a mandate of maintaining the inflation around 2%. The dollar is what it happens to be. It's not something the Bank concerns itself with. 

EDIT: An higher minimum wage would *lower* the dollar, I think, since it makes investing in Canada less appealing, therefore driving down the value of the dollar as it becomes less scarce on international markets. Not that this matters, of course. The dollar will be what the Canadian economy will need it to be. If we need lower purchasing power in order to aid a weakening economy to recover, then so be it. Floating exchange rates are convenient like that. Markets, not politicians or central bankers, set the proper value."
spacec0re,Sherlock,1389626918.0,"I agree with everything you've said. I can't understand why everyone else seems to see ""focus on character development"" where I see ""speeding into OOCVille on an express train.""

You want character development? Look at Sherlock's beautiful, subtle shift from selfisb sociopath into a man who may someday be a hero in season 2. Look at John's slow come to understand what Sherlock means to him and where his place is in that life.

This ""character development"" was laughs at the expense of characters. People doing things they wouldn't do. I honestly felt like this season was like watching How the Crunch Stole Christmas for how ham-fisted it was trying to turn their hero into something he was never supposed to be.  At least not THAT quickly. 

""And down in London they say, that Sherlock's small heart grew three sizes that day.""

Moffat said post S2E3 with regards to Sherlock,  ""sentimentalize him at your peril."" It seems he forgot his own advice.

InfinitelyThirsting,AskWomen,1389626920.0,"That just isn't true. Consent is consent. Enthusiastic consent may be best, but when I consent, even if it isn't enthusiastic, it's still consent. Just like even if your job isn't your dream job, it's still not slavery, if it's a real job.

By the time I was in 8th grade I was completely ostracized, they sent me to a psychologist at the school. There was absolutely nothing wrong with me, they basically thought quiet=learning disability(I was actually above average in all the tests). The reason I didn't do as well in school had nothing to do with my intelligence. Just the environment and the fact that every fucking project was a group project that culminated in a presentation.

Capitalism, Religious Freedom, Women's Rights, Not sharia law, you get the gist. 

That said.

If 9/11 hadn't happened something else would have, and that something else would probably have been a lot smaller scale. Actually the best case scenario is that 9/11 was covertly stopped, completely under the radar. There would not have been an attack on NYC, there would not have been an invasion, because no politician would have been willing to say ""BTW, there was a massive terrorist attack that we just barely stopped and now we want to go to war."" Instead there would have been a sudden upsurge in terrorists falling on bullets from suppressed weapons. Completely unrelated to America of course. We deny all knowledge of these events. "

""Like Oblivion you did nothing wrong, Angyase; this was entirely your fault. Every word you said since crossing that threshold was nothing but inciting, and to blatantly *lie* about things I said? *To my face*?"" I could feel the magic begin to loosen my muscles, and I turned my head as best I could to watch what was happening. Fayela was staring daggers at Angyase, hands planted firmly on her hips. If ever I had imagined what my own mother would have looked like when scolding me, I could choose no better representation. Angyase looked like a dog being scolded for ruining a pair of boots; chin tucked deep into his chest and his arms fidgeting behind his back. Fayela bent low to make eye contact with him. ""You deserved that beating, and I am disappointed in you. You should *know* you can't upset him like that any more, there will be consequences. You're lucky I was here to stop him or you would have been horribly injured.""

I was almost totally free of the paralysis, and I slowly made my way to my feet. Fayela looked at me as I stood up straight. ""I'm not apologizing for him,"" she said to me, ""he doesn't deserve it. You understand, don't you?"" I nodded sheepishly; I was unsure if she was upset with me as well. ""You two owe *each other* an apology. I'm not going to tell you why, you both should be able to figure it out on your own; be mature and sort it out."" I looked at Angyase, who was still looking downcast. I didn't want to apologize to him; I had nothing to apologize for. *He would be lucky to even get a word out of me.* I felt more anger bubble in my gut, and I wanted to hit him again. I shook my head, turning and grabbing my bow off the hook on the wall.

""I want to go hunting,"" I said, ""but I can't open the door to the colony."" I made my way to the door.

""&lt;Go,&gt;"" Fayela said. I heard Angyase protest, but Fayela repeated herself with even more force. ""&lt;The two of you will go out hunting! And do not even dream of coming back until you have resolved this stupid feud!&gt;""

I walked purposefully to the passageway to the upper world. Angyase caught up halfway through the tunnel, and we exited the secret door in silence."

emptyhands,socialanxiety,1389627714.0,"First of all, if you feel that social anxiety is hampering your life, medical treatment is something you should look into.  

Now, about your date.  The girl was probably experiencing some anxiety too - she didn't do what she did to hurt you, but to escape from a situation that was making her scared or uncomfortable partially stemming from her own mental baggage at least as much as from the date.  This does NOT excuse her behaviour.  I'm saying this to show you that she was also a very vulnerable person--you're not the only one who feels this way!  

It was not nice for her to leave you with the bill.  It was also not nice for her to end the date in what sounds like a pretty abrupt manner.  This is not normal dating behaviour and hopefully you won't experience that again anytime soon.  

I think that online dating is probably the most brutal way to date.  Everybody's stressed out about dating, everyone has a different idea of how to behave, hetero men are overwhelmed constantly by competition, and hetero women are overwhelmed constantly by the volume of communication they receive from people whom they know nothing about.  But.  It gets you dates.  You could sign up for an extra-curricular activity and actually meet people you already have something in common with, but this would not score you dates very frequently.  

Have you mentioned to family, friends, or co-workers that you are looking for a relationship?  Maybe putting yourself out there in that way would result in a date or two with someone who has been pre-screened by someone you trust.  

It's hard, and there's no getting around it.  You're actually already doing really well by having gone on some dates in the recent past.  Someone really special is out there looking for you - good luck in finding her.  "

    do {

    } while(0);

If you don't know what's happening underneath, this looks kind of strange.  A novice C programmer might assume that the code in the brackets doesn't get executed, or that it just gets executed the same as if the construct weren't there at all.

pharao007,europe,1389628041.0,"&gt;A big thing is the scale the gov underestimated the numbers that would come by a factor of ten.

Ok, they underestimated but what was the actual negative thing about it and if UK is so much concerned about immigration why it allows so many non-EU immigrants to come here? Oh an please don't use typical examples of full schools and NHS strained as top places of Eastern European immigration has seen a max 6% rise, where throughout whole country it was 1-1.5% max on average.

EU isn't going to expand any time soon, meaning the ""harm"" of accepting more than it was predicted immigrants from EU has already been done and it can't be un-done.

&gt;Free movement is good for business not so good for local workers.

In all situations? Isn't being competitive a positive? Doesn't it increase worker's attitudes and allows for more people to use services which they normally wouldn't afford? And yes, some immigrants, even from EU (although non-EU can have much bigger impact) reduced prices/wages too much but I strongly believe it is only in minority of all the situations. And again, how 1-1.5% of total increase of UK's population could have such HUGE influence on local market and its workers? What about the fact that immigrants themselves create new work places (directly and indirectly) - I personally create both of these and I didn't take anybody's job but started services which wouldn't be here if not EU immigrants."

I really doubt even half the people who glorify one category or damn the other actually read the books.  

Hell, maybe it's because I care more about the plot than the style of writing. Seems to me most people are on the opposite side of the matter.

Sorry for that rant"
am5437435,AskMen,1389628151.0,"I'm 30 years old so let me try to give you some perspective from the future.  Most of what I'm saying here applies to me and guys like me and I'm sure you can find plenty of guys who don't share my opinions.  It's also difficult to discuss this openly without coming off as chauvinistic.  If you read this, please remember that I'm trying to be honest and not trying to ""slut shame"" you.

I can tell you that unless the number is stupidly high, which yours isn't, although it's pushing the ""high"" number for your age, the context of the number would bother me far more than the number itself.  When you get to my age, all of the women of similar age have been with tons of guys, unless they were in a LTR for a chunk of their 20s (which presents its own problems that can be far more annoying than a promiscuous girl).  If you keep up this pace, by the time you get to your late 20s and might be looking for a husband, you'll be in the ""stupidly high"" category.  If I met you then, you wouldn't stand a chance with me.

A stupidly high number would give me concerns about whether you can be faithful (if we're in a typical exclusive relationship that's ""going somewhere"").  Which isn't to say I would dump you, but it would bother me.  But also, I get jealous easily.  I have to fight it to control it.  Depending on what the number is, it could be a deal breaker by itself.  Depending on how much I like you, I would have to consider whether giving you a chance to prove you're not unfaithful would be worth the aggravation.  But again, that would be my own insecurities based on my own experiences, in other words my own baggage, that you would have to deal with.

As for context: do I know the guys?  Have you banged all my friends?  That's a huge problem and ~~probably~~ almost certainly a deal breaker.

Are these guys you've been with still in contact with you?  If I start dating you, are all the guys you've banged going to be a part of our relationship?  Are you going to be receiving (and hopefully turning down) booty calls for the first 6 months of our relationship?  Are we going to have to publish a notice in the paper that you're no longer available for casual encounters?  That's a problem.  I'll know, by the way.

I'd like to be able to take you out somewhere and have a low chance of running into someone you fucked.  So, for example, if you just moved to town, but had a ton of partners in another city, it would bother me much less.

Are these partners one night stands or were they short term orgasm-fests?  One night stands bother me far less than if they were a series of guys you banged for a few weeks or a few months.  The emotional and social baggage is much higher if you had a fling with the guy rather than just a one nighter.  There would be too many potential threats to the relationship, so I would be uncomfortable, so I wouldn't start a relationship with you.

And lastly, a high number would make me ask why you're with me.  This will be more true in the future and not so much now.  When you get to your late 20s and you're trying to find a guy to marry, he's going to wonder why you suddenly decided on him instead of all the other dick.  It speaks to what you look for in love, what kind of person you are and where in your life you are.  Do you have any standards at all or do you just fuck the first dick that comes along when you're drunk?  Are you with me now because you realize your looks are going to fade soon and you need to reach out and grab onto something?  That would make me seriously question the underlying foundation of any potential relationship.  Am I the ""good guy"" you want to marry because I've got my shit together, could be a good father and provider for you, but I'm completely unlike the loser, shithead, tattooed, pierced, ""alpha"" (absolute misnomer btw) type guy you've been fucking for years?

In short, yes, it's going to be a problem for you.  You should not be so free with your body.  People will judge you.  The problem is not that you like sex - girls that like sex are awesome.  The problem is that you'll suck or fuck anyone that strikes your fancy, apparently.

Hopefully I've been able to show you some of the male psyche in this post so you can better understand what you're up against.  We men get jealous and insecure easily, especially when it comes to the vagina we consider to be ""ours.""

In general though, most guys (or at least the worthwhile guys) will take the perspective that the two of you weren't together *then* when you were sleeping around, but you're together *now* and that you can't judge a person based on their past.  But he *will* judge you based on your past.  Just don't make that too difficult for him and you'll be ok."

What this post tells me is that you have got to be more assertive in your wishes and sticking to them.  Yes you insisted that he put a condom on - which he did, but later took it off again.  What I'm reading in your post is that once you realized ""he wasn’t going to leave without getting what he came for"" you gave in and allowed him inside you, without a condom, which you didn't want to happen.  

There is ALWAYS recourse to getting someone out of your house.  Sometimes it means even getting out yourself.  Grab your clothes, keys, and cellphone and go outside.  Then call someone - probably the police.  Let them know you have someone in your home that won't leave and you wish for them to come and remove the person.  Let the law work for you!  Don't give in to someone's idiotic desires just to get them out of your house.  

Please, never again give a man power over your body.  Take control of your body and the situation.  Barring someone threatening your life with a weapon, leave the premises and make the phone call.  You might feel bad in doing so, but at least you'll be safer in doing so.

This sentence made me sadder then I've been in a long time. Your post says that you've been in therapy for a long time, but have you specifically addressed your romantic relationships in it? Your boyfriend is *not* treating you well. This is borderline emotional abuse. This is a deeply unhealthy relationship already and you haven't even met in person. Please consider dumping him. 

I suspect your history of abuse makes this guy seem better than he really is - and he probably is in comparison to your past. But please, please take an objective opinion - he is not protective. He is dangerously controlling and emotionally manipulative. I cannot even list all the red flags this guy is throwing up. 

I wish you the best. Please speak to your therapist about this relationship as soon as humanly possible. Definitely before meeting him.

Let me reiterate again: *This behaviour is VERY unusual and DEEPLY concerning*. This is NOT normal behavior, is it NOT healthy behaviour, and you are endangering yourself at the least emotionally by entering a relationship with him. He is *scaring* you, he is irrational, and he has anger problem. I see a very high risk that this will turn to physical abuse.  "

slapdashbr,buildapc,1389628356.0,"I recommend you wait. I'd also recommend looking into an i3-4130 or better rather than an fx-6300 unless you want to overclock the 6300. With an i3 you can get a cheaper mobo without sacrificing much. You need a somewhat more expensive mobo and an aftermarket CPU cooler with the fx-6300 to get optimal gaming performance, as most games still run better on intel chips. 

Either way, definitely wait. The 650 ti boost is just about the most cost-efficient GPU you can get (or radeon 7850 for around the same price), assuming it's about $150 for a 2GB model, anything less powerful is a worse deal. Anything more powerful is better, obviously but the price increases faster than the performance. Pretty much the same situation with the CPUs. either an i3-4130 or fx-6300 will be good enough to run modern games smoothly. Anything less, and you will likely lost some noticeable performance. Anything more is going to give smaller gains for the cost. So the build you might put together if you wait is a much better deal that what you could build now. "

On the other hand, we were thisclose to booking with a venue that had never sent us an itemized quote.  Right before we were about to sign the contract, we asked for one (good idea, dad!).  Turns out they had service charges on *everything,* even though competitors didn't charge service on venue rentals, labor, or equipment rental.  None of this was mentioned in the contract.

(They would have given them baths and changed diapers for years, it's not like they've never touched their butt before, and 10 is still pretty young.)

Then there's the problem that, at least to my knowledge,  most of the new hats are community now.  So if you made that craft only then the makers couldn't share in the profits.  I'm sure there's a simple solution though.  

Imo it's a self correcting problem, the hat is nice so people want it but it's rare so it's worth a lot so it's worth it to take a gamble on it. The profitability margin on crates is pretty low, for most of them, but people still gamble for the 1% unusual chance. It would make sense to take a smaller gamble for a smaller reward, especially one in which no money changes hands.

Being that it is an island, we had to take a ferry.

We got to talking, and I learned he was also an American, visiting with his family.

I can experience ""the fear of death"" as a phenomenon removed from my sense of identity, and impartially understand how it plays a role in my reaction to events.

Maybe the notion that I am inclined to view existence as neutral is indicative of some irrational pessimism on my part that ought to be examined, though.

Tavarish,TrueDetective,1389628599.0,"If we were to jump into some conclusions based on initial expression I would guess that...

* Hart is or did fucking around with that woman from court

   * Cohle most likely ends up confronting Hart about possibility

* Maggie feels sympathy towards Cohle, she can relate to feeling of losing child

   * Hers marriage most likely starts to crack

     * There is already some distance between her and Hart

   * She most likely at some points want to understand what is going on with Hart, if he is cracking, so she will talk to Cohle

     * Can lead into all kinds of shit if and when hers marriage is going to shit and being sympathetic already towards Cohle

         * Too early to say, need 1-2 more episodes to see if Cohle &amp; Maggie interactions keep up and how they go about it

* Having so different views of the world, physical &amp; spiritual, will most likely cause some clashing during investigation between Cohle and Hart

   * I guess Hart doesn't want hear Cohle's *shit* because it could cause him to slash out on Cohle for having so *ungodly* view of world

I guess this case will put huge strain on Hart's and Maggie's marriage, with possibility of Hart cheating on her and Maggie starting to bond with Cohle, which will end up breaking one or both of them. There was some strain on marriage already visible during Ep 1."

And I'm trying to find ways to be at peace without an apology, because as you noted, an apology doesn't fix anything anyway. They have to live with what happened, and since neither of them are full N (especially not since I moved out), I figure that's probably punishment enough.

I have good days and bad days, though. And I've definitely been tempted to confront them on my bad days. Your actions here are quite understandable.

If it's any consolation, I think the pain gets better as you get older, for the most part. That seems to be the general trend from my experience and that of others I've observed or talked to.

He does make a couple of good points, but completely ignores the counterpoints that haviz is making.

Active defense, as he calls it, is sort of imbalanced, seeing how it ignored gear and is capable of avoiding almost all damage if you play skillfully. I agree with this point.

The point he seems to be oblivious to, even when pointed out, is that in a world where there would be no active defense, there would be no point in running anything offensive. If there would be no active defense, passive defensive setups would be the META and no one would run offensive gear.

The active defense is there to balance out the lack of passive defense in an offensive build. Without it, there would be no offensive builds.

The idea of nerfing active defense, or making it dependent on defensive stats is preposterous and would destroy any and all offensive setups, because they would become useless immediately.

The only possible fix I see is improving enemy AI and adding in low hitting autoattacks that give some pressure to a team.

Messing around with active defense will simply ruin everything and make even more people leave the game."

Borror0,CanadaPolitics,1389628935.0,"&gt; If this is true. Then a loss of some of those jobs might not be a giant disaster either.

While the majority of the people who do earn a minimum wage do not live in poor households, some do. It matters because raising the minimum wage may even *increase* the poverty rate. 

[Campolieti, Gunderson
and Lee \(2012\)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12122-012-9139-8) ""find that job losses are disproportionately concentrated on the poor."" [Sen, Rybczynski and Van De Waal \(2011\)](http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/labeco/v18y2011i1p36-47.html) go further, concluding that ""a 10% rise in the minimum wage is also significantly associated with a 4%-6% increase in the percentage of families living under Low Income Cut Offs (LICOs)."" It's pretty damning, in my opinion.

And that's while ignoring the welfare loss for others, who cannot find their job. While a young student is by no means poor (the typical university student's family earns a more than respectable wage), the inability to find has a cost on his ability to afford many goods and services. "

alc6379,guns,1389629060.0,"&gt; S&amp;W Bodyguard

I hadn't even thought of that one. 

&gt; Walther PPK or any of the ""knockoffs""

I was trying to look for 9mm before I looked at .380, but this is worth considering. 

&gt; Glock 26, 27, 36

I shot the 26, and it felt... meh. Didn't fit as well in my hand as my Glock 30SF. The 27 is the same form factor, and I don't like .40. I'd consider the 36, but I'm trying to go for something pocketable for times when I don't have the capability to carry IWB. 

&gt; Springfield XDs

Great thought. I actually like the XDs .45 caliber. I only have .45's right now, so I could standardize on ammo. 

&gt; Ruger LCP or LCR

I had an LC9. The trigger pull is WAY too long for my hands-- I wind up hitting my support hand with my trigger finger. The LCP is going to be the same way. Which is a shame, because I thought a purple LCP looked kind of neat. As for the LCR, I've heard that the trigger kind of sucks on it, but I've never held one. 

&gt; Colt Mustang

I like the idea, but I don't want to carry a cocked-and-locked single action in my pocket. But, that might be an awesome gun to consider for smaller IWB carry. 

&gt; Kahr PM9 or CM9

PM9 is nice but a bit pricey. I didn't like the CM9's trigger. 

&gt; Sig Sauer 238 or 938

I like that I can get that in 9mm, but there again, not keen on the idea of a single action in my pocket. 

&gt; NAA Mini Revolver (For those who Zaptal CarryTM )

Hah. I think if I have to carry one of these, I'll just opt for pocket sand. (*sh-shah!*)

&gt; Keltec P3AT

Not a bad option, but I'm worried about trigger pull being like the LC9/LCP's. I need to check one of these out; seems like my LGS's can't keep them in. 

&gt; Beretta Nano

I totally wasn't impressed by the form factor of this, and the lack of a slide catch. 

&gt; Some kind of S&amp;W hammerless J-frame

I hadn't considered these. Are these going to be easily pocketable? 

&gt; Those are the ones off the top of my head, but I own a Shield and would tell you to look no further. S&amp;W really made something special.

This seems like the conclusion I'm coming to. I have found a few places in town where I can get a like-new, never-carried Shield with 2 magazines for $350 OTD. I may wind up splurging on one of those this weekend. "

Seriously. Do you even know what you're talking about? 

From Osama bin Laden's letter after 9/11

""Those who believe, fight in the Cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve, fight in the cause of Taghut (anything worshipped other than Allah e.g. Satan). So fight you against the friends of Satan; ever feeble is indeed the plot of Satan.""[Quran 4:76]

""In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,
Permission to fight (against disbelievers) is given to those (believers)""

""These governments have surrendered to the Jews, and handed them most of Palestine, acknowledging the existence of their state over the dismembered limbs of their own people.""

(Q2) As for the second question that we want to answer: What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?

(1) The first thing that we are calling you to is Islam.

(a) The religion of the Unification of God; of freedom from associating partners with Him, and rejection of this; of complete love of Him, the Exalted; of complete submission to His Laws; and of the discarding of all the opinions, orders, theories and religions which contradict with the religion He sent down to His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Islam is the religion of all the prophets, and makes no distinction between them - peace be upon them all.

It is to this religion that we call you; the seal of all the previous religions. It is the religion of Unification of God, sincerity, the best of manners, righteousness, mercy, honour, purity, and piety. It is the religion of showing kindness to others, establishing justice between them, granting them their rights, and defending the oppressed and the persecuted. It is the religion of enjoining the good and forbidding the evil with the hand, tongue and heart. It is the religion of Jihad in the way of Allah so that Allah's Word and religion reign Supreme. And it is the religion of unity and agreement on the obedience to Allah, and total equality between all people, without regarding their colour, sex, or language."

I also love *Under the Pink* (1994) and *Boys for Pele* (1996). *The Beekeeper* (2005), *Scarlet’s Walk* (2002), and *American Doll Posse* (2007) are also quite good and regularly find themselves in my listening rotation, although they’re a bit more mellow. *Cruel* is from *From the Choirgirl Hotel* (1998), which I’ve heard and liked, but haven’t gotten around to listening to properly.

* This [interview](&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuZ5hm4P88c&gt;) about religion and women’s sexuality (c. 1994).

* This [cover](&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ol3hRPYSE&gt;) of Mr. Joe Jackson’s *Real Men*, from *Strange Little Girls* (2001) (her album of remakes of famous men’s songs from a woman’s perspective), performed live (2001).

* [*Sweet the String*](&lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s-EdEDhm5Q&gt;) from *The Beekeeper* (2005) (music video).

* The fan site [YesSaid.com](&lt;http://yessaid.com/&gt;). It needs a makeover, but has a large collection of Tori’s quotes, both about her songs and about other things. Also has a large archive of bootlegged concerts, if you’re into that sort of thing.

Malne,AskReddit,1389629430.0,"1) Odds are, if you're making minimum wage at McDonalds or Wendys, you're not going to get a new job miles away from your old job but if for some reason you do, people are capable of and should be responsible for analyzing the costs/benefits of a new job. If it means a foot in the door to a career that you're interested in, or more room for advancement in your current industry, etc, then it can be worth it even if the opportunity costs are higher.  Making a blanket statement like this isn't helpful and it's certainly not frugal. Also, moving from $8 an hour to $10 an hour is not going to put you in a higher tax bracket, you'll pay the exact same percentage of your paycheck to taxes. Yes, that means more money out, but more money goes home. Again, if the benefits are worth the extra cost and you can make the sacrifice, it's being frugal. If your bottom line is money in your pocket, you're being cheap and shortsighted.

2) How many young kids (16? 18? 21? How are you defining this?) do you think there are selling broken down junkers? The average age in 2011 for a new car buyer was 51. Some adults buy used cars, some buy new, they all sell them down the road too. If you don't like buying from young kids, find an adult owner. Problem solved. Making blanket statements like this makes you look ignorant. 2a) How are Kia and **Hyundai** lesser known? They've been in the States for years now, they're not no-name brands, just ones with less luxurious reputations. Some models have their problems, the same with any brand, including luxury automakers. They are not somehow bulletproof because you spend more money on them upfront. 2b) How are you going to argue that spending 5k on a car with a pre-purchase inspection to identify any faults and some money for repairs beats spending minimum 10-15k, plus tax and fees. I bought a 5 year old Subaru for $11750 and with tax and fees and interest ended up paying about $17000 over 5 years. I enjoyed the car, it got me where I needed to go and overall was pretty troublefree. Realistically, I could have paid $8k or less for something a little older with a few more miles and more than made up for any repair costs by saving $4k up front and a similar amount in interest and tax.

3) Instead of trying to earn small-time cash in your free time on Ebay, why wouldn't you spend that time improving your skills or learning a new trade that will make you more valuable so that you can earn more money when you work and still have time off once you've improved? Why would you recommend an activity with no guarantee of income and a high degree of risk when you can go borrow a book on coding from the library or spend a couple hundred dollars to take a course at a community college that might add a significant bump to your income when leveraged correctly and improve your chances for further raises and promotions?"

Boobs can only be too small for bringing a man physical sensation in titty fucking. So if titty fucking is a critical part of the enjoyment that a man gets out of sex (rare, but there are some men for whom it is a fetish), then small boobs become a functional limitation. In that case, I would tell that man to either leave the woman, or see if she would be open to breast augmentation. Similarly, if a man's gf had a vagina that was so loose that it impaired his sensation during PIV, I would advise him to either leave her, or talk to her about doing kegels and/or possibly surgery (in the case of vaginal looseness due to age and childbirth)."

Unfriendly_Giraffe,Mustang,1389629587.0,"Some more information... I used theretrofitsource.com to get a Morimoto mini-H1 kit for the car. The HID kit appears well-made, and all comes packaged very well. I got the 5000k kit and relay so it was all plug in play. Installing the HIDs was simple.

The difficult part was taking the headlights apart. I mangled the first one pretty badly because I put it in the oven several times, softening a lot of the plastic. The entire perimeter of the light now has screwdriver marks, and I ended up accidentally breaking one of the mounting brackets. The second light went without a hitch, couldn't believe it. (230 degrees for 20 mins)

Problems: 
The projector is a little on the cheap side; it's mostly plastic. 

The mounting bolt isn't long enough to fit the nut on the back. Solutions from TRS include cutting the back of the reflector down so there's room, or using the bulb-mount as the clamping force. I don't have a dremel, so I opted for the 2nd option. It seems pretty tight and sturdy.

All of the people you get to meet and all of the experiences you get to have. Don't worry about commitments and all of that as much as you worry about how much fun you're having. 

You've had a long relationship now, so you know at least what kind of things you refuse to settle for and without. Start building on that while you date yourself.

I'm not dying to be in a relationship right now. I'm happy. That doesn't mean I don't want one eventually, that doesn't mean I'm not flirting with strangers when I can. It means I have patience, confidence, and a good head on my shoulders and that I'm enjoying meeting new people while all the time improving myself.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389629739.0,"&gt;Are we 'smarter' than 'society'?

intelligence is as arbitrary as the next thing in my mind.  everybody is just making sense of what it means to be a human being.  i think INTP's tend toward more metaphysically logically consistent thinking than other types, but it's hard to call this inherently superior thinking.  biologically, normative superiority in behavior choices tends to be what is consistent with social norms, which one could argue renders INTP's linguistically stupider than more common types in the evolutionary framework of humanity.  TLDR:  in my opinion calling a personal attribute 'better' or 'worse' is a game of semantics to service the ego.

&gt;Are we more removed than the general public?

removed from what?  i'm not sure how to answer this exactly, but i definitely find my sense of personal identity to exist most clearly in my imagination.  generally, i don't remember the confines and limitations of external physical reality very often unless ruminating upon them in a depressive episode.  i generally only consider anything to be ""reality"" if it is a direct personal experience of my own.  all potential external possibilities (""physically possible"" and utterly fantastical) literally exist in my mind, what prevents them from existing as ""reality"" is my PERSONAL physical limitation, not any such rules as they apply to the science of our cosmos.

&gt;Is it because modern society values ExFJs so much?

there is not some thing called society that decides who gets the privilege of widespread social approval.  there are a ton of people on earth whose ability to influence one another manifests itself in verbal and nonverbal forms of communication and, inevitably, some of those peoples' qualities and attributes will receive a more frequent amounts of affirmation or disapproval, based on their similarity to social norms in the population doing the judging.

this is, in fact, the exact method by which socially unjust ""privileges"" come to exist: for example, the assumed superiority of the white male over the woman of color.  INTP's are minorities in many social contracts, but not inherently all (for example, a nuclear family full of INTP's with one outlying ESFJ).  Minority populations tend to get their experiences ignored, which usually puts them in the position of justifying themselves in ways the powerful majority is not expected to do.

&gt;Is it because we feel excluded?

As alluded to in my answer above, I think it is more about feeling ignored and misunderstood than it is about feeling excluded.  For types whose preferences align with more socially common thinking mechanisms, the idea of having to justify your thought processes doesn't even come into play.  When we discuss ideas we make conclusions that come from various paths of thinking.  With types whose thinking path is a busy freeway, the destinations on the exit signs are widely known by many.  With types whose thinking path is more of a little used deer path, the destinations between the trees aren't as obvious to others.  

Other types assume our CONCLUSIONS to be bad because the thinking processes they are utilizing don't naturally lead them there.  We are then left to either accept others' poor appraisal of our ideas or we can attempt to justify HOW our thinking gets us to our conclusions."

Mother:  
Single mother and I was her only child; as such we've always been close.  We lived with my grandparents, aunts, and other cousins in one house for the first 7 years of my life.  Her and my dad never married and I only saw him weekends.  Being her only child she always worried about me and still does, but that doesn't mean she doesn't trust me.  All through my younger years all she asked for was for me to be smart and stay safe, calling her from where I was to tell her when I'd be home.  We talk on the phone most nights of the week about things we used to discuss when I lived at home (TV shows we watch, how work is going, updates in life, etc).  She doesn't like the neighbourhood I currently live in and used to always end phone calls by asking if my windows and doors were shut (to which I told her, if a thief wanted to climb 5 stories to my apartment they could take my stuff).

Father:  
Even though I didn't live with him, he still did his best to be a part of my life.  I remember him picking me up from daycare or kindergarten (even though it was a 45min drive from where he lived) to take me to a movie or to McDonalds before driving me home.  As I grew older (into my teens) I saw him once every 1-2 weeks on weekends.  There was a period where I didn't talk to him for close to two years because I was a stubborn asshole and still regret it.  Being his only son, I can only imagine what I put him through.  He moved out to California for a few years and saw him maybe once or twice a year and talked around once a week and texted/e-mailed between that.  He's since moved closer (Michigan) and I try to see him more often now; our talking schedule remains the same, but because new texting rules now charges me for sending/receiving texts from the US we only e-mail.  Growing up on my mom's side of the family has made it a little harder to connect with his side of the family, but we still do get along great.  Over the years he's dated some people I just could not stand (one will forever be known as THE bitch), which caused some strain in our relationship, but now that he's getting up there in age I'd like nothing more for him than to find someone to settle down with.

Step-dad:  
My mom and I moved in with my step-dad when I was 7 and they got married a few years after that.  I always got along great with him, but as soon as marriage talk started it was the stereotypical stepson-stepdad relationship with a only child son involved; I felt like he was a threat to my mom's happiness and felt like I should protect her.  I said things I shouldn't have, and while I'm sure they forgot about them, sometimes the thought that I said them still haunt me.  Over the years though it's been great; he never tried to replace my father and did a good job raising me along with my mom.  "

I was never a super skinny dude, except as a teen. My friend was though. He was 145, now he's 195. He started with Mark Rippetoe's *Starting Strength* program. The book is worth the purchase. 

Eating enough *and* working out is the key to putting on weight. Him (and me) have both done GOMAD (Gallon of milk a day) coupled with Starting Strength to get a good base. Although he even said, he would have never done GOMAD if he was taking these shakes (its not all that fun). 

I have done some other pretty miserable bulks. Although they did help me get stronger, they were so uncomfortable. These shakes are a good way to get a lot of calories in a convenient and not completely miserable package.

Noneerror,AskReddit,1389630096.0,"Autosomal recessive disorders and basic population statistics.

People carry recessive genes for genetic disorders and it doesn't hurt them at all because it can only cause a problem if the same gene is inherited from both your mother and father. Let's say there's a 1 in 1000 chance in the general population carries one of these genes. The odds that both parents happen to have this is 1 in 1000 x 1000... aka one in a million. There's a 1 in a million chance this gene results in an *actual problem.*

Doctors don't think about one in a million health issues. That's the rare stuff they never see. They think about the common stuff first. But Guardian'ofWhispers odds are 1 in 1000, not 1 in a million. A doctor that would normally automatically discount some rare health issue has to rethink the odds. This isn't just for the rare stuff either. Whatever the odds are of an autosomal recessive disorder in the general population, the doctor has to take the square root of to get GuardianofWhispers personal odds.

Hemtroll,changemyview,1389630101.0,"Who decides what is racist and/or sexist though? Some people think you can't be racist against white people, others think you can. Why should either opinion be favored? Without commenting on SRS specifically, allowing one group of people to break the site-wide rules is essentially going to be the same as reddit officially endorsing that group and what they do which could easily backfire if the group in question does something questionable. If you were to allow downvote brigades everywhere on the site, that's a surefire way to kill off any sort of discussion or dissenting opinions.

 Reddit is already pretty much a collection of popularity contests but at least with downvote brigades theoretically banned, smaller communities which may be centered around fringe opinions or interests are safe from outside harassment. You can start a sub dedicated to taboo topics like sexual fetishes or unpopular political opinions without fear of the general public disrupting your discussion/hangout/whatever. If downvote brigades were allowed, what would all those people do?

What's to stop a bigger sub from invading and essentially bullying their opponents or people whose opinions deviate from their own off of the site? If we assume that the average redditor is a young white liberal male, why would anyone else want to come around to express their opinions when the greater community would just brigade their subs and downvote everything they disagree with?

The voting system on reddit is inherently anti-discussion because not only is it easy to ignore anyone with differing opinions, you can actively try to hide their posts from public view but at least with the current rules you can create your own sub for like-minded people to come and discuss things that are shunned in the bigger subs. You can create a sub to discuss the problems that people of your (race/gender/religion) face and if someone else decides to invade your sub you can contact an admin for help."

Women who hate men (should not be described as feminists, they are misandrists and they do **not** pursue equality) aren't that common. From the amount of women in American gaming culture that complain about the shitty treatment we've heard about, I sincerely doubt it has been fabricated.

&gt;He was attending a conference in Barcelona, and we spoke for over an hour about his company and its major pipeline drug that has recently received FDA approval. Much to my amazement, they've managed to synthesize a vaccine that has proven to be incredibly effective in treating certain types of cancer.

&gt;In the course of our discussion, he told me about several other companies in the same industry which were deeply undervalued by the market.

&gt;""The interesting thing about this industry,"" he said, ""is that all the science is already public information, published in the medical journals. Our stock prices don't move, though, for months until the IR department issues a press release. Smart investors have an interim window to scoop up the next breakthrough drug company for pennies.""

&gt;He cited a few examples, including one company that had over 9-months between its medical journal publication and press release. The stock barely budged during that time period, but within weeks of the press release it was a 10-bagger."

in the EU parliament the responsible votes are currently outnumbered by the self-serving and the irresponsible; the EU is shit for us and good for them and increasing the EUs authority would only intensify this problem

slockley,AskReddit,1389630540.0,"&gt; I don't suppose it has anything like a first-hand or even second-hand account of Jesus's life

I think we mentioned the gospels, which are (arguably) second-hand accounts.  Clearly you believe they aren't, and that's fine.

&gt; So I assume your reasoning is that there is (at least) a rough correlation between the number of people who believe in a deity and the likelihood of that deity's existence. 

What you described there is ad populum, but is not what I am claiming.  I'm suggesting that the wager is a perspective that illustrates the necessity of the rational mind to believe in God.  In the context of a nonbeliever, it's a call to pursue faith.  So the nonbeliever who is exposed to many candidates for a true belief system must consider all possibilities.

Immediately, one considers that there are infinite possibilities, and the task seems daunting.  But if the true god is found through a belief system that doesn't exist, then all bets are off.  It means that god hasn't revealed itself to mankind, but there's no way to know what that god's path to reward is.

So for each possible response a person can have to an unknown god's potential path, there is an equal likelihood that such a path are actually bad, because the unrevealed god actually wants the opposite of what we're arbitrarily guessing is the right path.  So on average, there is no benefit; pursuing an unrevealed god is a process by which any response has zero benefit, probabilistically speaking.

However, if we pursue the set of *known* religions, we can take advantage of Pascal's Wager.  The benefit of a religion's path is equal to its promised benefit multiplied by its likelihood of being true.  So in a world of hundreds of religions, one could view that probability as being low.  But one could also consider the rewards of religion (eternal life in heaven, for example) extremely high or even infinitely better than the alternative of non-belief (nothingness, if antithiesm is to be believed).

So by that reasoning, known religions outpace unknown religions in benefit.  This is not ad populum, but I can see why it might look like it at first."

Borror0,CanadaPolitics,1389630580.0,"I think people underestimate the political feasibility of mincome. 

While I wouldn't expect a $8,000 mincome to be created at once without any issue, slowly moving to that direction by abolishing existing tax credits and increasing the amount granted by the HST rebate is doable. 

With incrementalism, Canada could eventually arrive at a rather reasonable guaranteed income without scaring anyone. Then, once it's proven to be a reasonable policy, the final move can be made by a political party to finalize the policy (harmonize policy with other governments, increase the benefits, etc.) without costing much political capital. It isn't as if minimum wage was first enacted at a shockingly high amount. It was first set at a politically palatable amount and raised over decades as support grew. 

It's certainly, in my opinion, a better use of time in power and political capital than increasing the minimum wage. At least, here, you do have a measurable effect on poverty. Each increase in the amount will push at the margin out of poverty. Slow but steady wins the race. "

wolfkin,boardgames,1389630588.0,"I think cards is a terrible game. But honestly as a traveling game it sorta works. It's absolute blast the first 3 times you play it. So for new people it should work. Please do yourself a favor and set a limit to cards. Even if it's a big limit like first to 20 but let there be an ending. Do not play out the entire deck in one night.

I actually prefer [Snake Oil]. Similar gameplay but more creative than offensive. Not that you can't get dirty with Snake Oil but it's all in the double entendres rather than just having 'Bigger, Blacker Dick' printed on a card.

[Bohnanza] is a game that always gets people talking and engaged i highly recommend that as it will travel well.

[Anomia] is a fun game. travels well.. but while it will get people engaged, it won't necessarily get them talking. It's a very bursty game. 

[Evolution: Origin of the Species] travels well and it's actually a pretty fun little game. You do get a nice banter going.

[Get Bit] is just goofy enough that I think you could have fun playing it with strangers. Plus you could make it a drinking game easily enough. (same with Anomia btw)

[Hanabi] travels wonderfully. Will have people really engaged, not AS much talking but I find it's a rather bonding experience usually. It's a sort of game that you can talk about after. 

[King of Tokyo] I'm not sure it travels well but if it's within your limits that's just good fun. Very goofy, can be drinking game, and it's pretty engaging

[Love Letter] if you are looking at four players or less than most definitely. If you regularly plan to be playing with more than four than skip it. Then again it's just 16 cards. You could practically fit it in your wallet.

[The Resistance: Avalon] of course.. if you're playing with 10 or less people this is a game that can travel very well. Go ahead and get the Avalon version. You can customize the roles (or not) and drop the board and counters. Now the game is just a small deck of cards. You're on vacation you can play two hour long games with lots of arguing.

[Saboteur] if you want to play a game with betrayal without it taking 2 hours long then this is your game. Much lighter less arguing but still plenty of room to beguile people

[[Tattletale](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/149425/tattletale)] if you want to do something like Resistance but more abstract. Or if you're famimliar with Prisoner's Dilemna

[Two Rooms and a Boom] if you ever think you'll have 10 people wanting to play a huge party game. 1/2 hour rounds. Plenty of replayability and you can print out the basics plus 3-4 advanced sets and still have it fit in a single deckbox.

[Word ARound] for a light and easy game like Anomia but less tablespace."

Whizbang,piano,1389630687.0,"The ragtime era spans a time period from about 1896 to 1920. This coincides with the rise in availability of recorded music. There really isn't any archival material I know of that captures ragtime performances around the inception of ragtime (and certainly not as it would have been performed in a sporting house).

The main transmission method of early ragtime was via printed sheets. Furthermore, the performance culture was such that musicians who could read music were regarded more highly than those who couldn't. And syncopated melodies were, in and of themselves, extremely novel to 19th century ears.

All this goes to say that early ragtime was almost certainly played with straight rhythms, as was much late ragtime. Composers such as Artie Matthews, who composed his 5 Pastime rags between about 1914 and 1921, go so far as to annotate the scores with the admonition ""Don't fake!"" Joplin is reputed to have always played his rags exactly as written.

But in the latter half of the ragtime era, when it's beginning to morph into novelty and stride and blues, things are certainly much fuzzier. Straight rhythms in music were beginning to evolve into swung rhythms and no doubt there were players in the time who applied swung rhythms to ostensibly straight ragtime pieces. In fact, that Matthews notated his later scores with ""Don't fake!"" is evidence that there were performers who took liberties with the written music and possibly the rhythms.

In short, you can probably never go wrong if you choose to play any ragtime piece with rhythms as notated. However, swung rhythms are a viable stylistic choice that may reflect the way that some performers interpreted the music, particularly later in the ragtime era."

namer98,Christianity,1389630820.0,"&gt; Namer98, you don't have to convince me that the text has layers of meanings. You are 'preaching to the choir' in that regard. I read it almost every day, have read it through many many times and still see new applications and depth to it every. single. time.

Yet you don't have any examples.

&gt;The plain meaning of Genesis 1-3 is entirely plausible and very comfortably precedes any scientific application.

There is no ""plain"" meaning because God is not ""plain"". 

&gt;Evolution as abiogenesis, or theories of origins, opposes the biblical record.

I disagree. 

&gt;I see no reason whatsoever to tweak or adjust it, or to reject or question it.

God is complex, so we should dive into his text, which must be complex like God."

gusset25,switcharoo,1389630863.0,"Hi. Thanks for your first roo. We'll approve this one but I thought visitors to this roo might like to know why it is controversial.

A roo is a switching of two discrete already-introduced subjects, not an ambiguity over what one subject means. See the diagram in the sidebar. 

In this case, one subject was ""they"" (which implicitly is the passenger) and maggots had been introduced as another subject. the roo highlighted the ambiguity over ""they"" as referring to the maggots. I took the view that although the passenger had been introduced only implicitly, it had still been introduced and that is good enough.

If you are reading this and thinking that we take our rooing too seriously here, well you're not wrong.

JoshuaIan,eu4,1389630916.0,"This has nothing to do with your question, but damn unless you have diplomatic or expansion ideas, you're probably getting like 2 diplo monarch points a month.

In case you're unfamiliar with the mechanic : You have a cap on how many ""relations"" you can have with other nations. This includes royal marraiges, vassalations, alliances, receive military/fleet access, etc. The base cap amount is 4, so if you don't have diplomatic idea group or expansion idea group (either has a +2 relations idea), with just those vassals, you're at a -3 penalty to the amount of diplo points you get a month. Ouch. Hover over your diplomatic point total to see the breakdown of what I'm talking about, in your case it's probably 7/4 unless you have diplo or expansion idea groups.

Regarding management, I usually just set it to X3 or X4, until I wipe out the main enemy force, and to pause at the end of every engagement. It's not perfect, but, it allows me to order an attack and then go manage some other area of the map.

I think I'd love to go Umich philosophy major ---&gt; Umich philosophy PhD ---&gt; teach somewhere, but how good are my chances of major---&gt;PhD at umich?

I'm a fairly strong student (I get mostly As, but I don't do much school work because I'm heavily involved in debate, so my grades suffer a little... but I've impressed my teachers because they think I'm intelligent, so I'm able to get good letters of rec, etc.), so I think I'd get solid grades at Umich. Would it be easy for me to interact with professors in order to do the necessary networking to get letters of rec for graduate school?

It's a risk, I know. I'm confident that I'll do well at Michigan - assuming that's the case, is it likely that a Umich philosophy major will place well in grad school?

You have people who will watch, study, and discuss football plays and moves and matches and clearly have their favorite team, and will go to get-togethers and discuss it with friends and other fans and get into arguments/debates and just basically have a good time.  This isn't their entire life.  They all probably have jobs ranging from lower working class to upper class and do many different things.  It's just one part of who they are.

That said, it's not a bad question. It does raise another question: Are the majority of women capable of understanding the guy's perspective in this case?

While I completely understand and could handle it if my girl cheated under these conditions and told me about it, I do not believe the majority of women are even capable of understanding. Not because women aren't smart enough to understand, but because their experience with sex and dating is so vastly different.

carpetano,soccer,1389631304.0,"[European Cup Final 1974](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_European_Cup_Final). Bayern 0 - Atlético de Madrid 0. The teams go to extra time, and Luis Aragonés scores a free kick in minute 114 (6 minutes before the end of extra time). Then, 1 minute before the end, Schwarzenbeck scores from outside of the box, and the match ends 1-1. There weren't penalty shoots to untie finals those days, so they had a replay game two days later. Atlético players were still exhausted and Bayern owned them physically. They replay finished 4-0 and Bayern won the European Cup.

I'd just erase Schwarzenbeck's goal from History.

My other choice would be avoid Jesús Gil to put his hands on Atlético de Madrid, although I don't know if that would have happened if Atlético had won the 1974 European Cup and the ""pupismo"" didn't exist (Pupismo: theory that says there is some kind of bad luck curse over Atlético that avoid them to make big things)"

I mean, see it like this, The Princess Bride was written like the book included plenty of historical commentary and so on of the country of Florin. Nowhere in the book does the author tell you that there never was such a country, in fact, quite the contrary, he even mentioned visiting it in the foreword.

I'm studying to be a technologist (which HR just considers engineering), so that means my college curriculum includes both programming and engineering classes (it's unique for the area I live I think). 

So, taking Right Livelihood into account, I wouldn't want to work for military and defense, or government weapons development, or anything like that.

Since I'm a student now, currently I wouldn't want to work for: 

bars - encourages drunkeness, which wouldn't be so bad if people under the influence didn't get hurt/killed in bar fights/shootings, cheat on their partners, drive drunk, and if rapists and thieves didn't take advantage of drunk people

drug dealers - they sell to kids, drug use can cripple already  disadvantaged communities, drugs are often used for exploitation and rape, and the suppliers often exploit the people they hire, including children

butcher shops - deals in meat 

pornographers - drinking, drugs, exploitation, rape (in extreme cases if the actor/actress is too intoxicated to give consent to whatever is happening during filming, or amateur rape porn, which includes ejaculating on and penetrating sleeping people without their consent)

strip clubs - can be intertwined with prostitution, human trafficking, and child exploitation in some areas

...etc. 

While I don't look down on butchers, drug dealers (unless they sell hard drugs and dangerous shit then yes, they need a new line of work), bartenders (especially not!), pornographers/pornstars, strippers, escorts, and prostitutes, if I was employed as one of the latter three I could run the risk of encouraging cheating (on gfs/bfs) and adultery. 

Technically you aren't complicit (in the Buddhist sense) if you don't know the patron is married or in an exclusive relationship, but personally I feel that refusing a man (or any client) when things get started after you find out they are committed puts sex workers in a dangerous situation.

And of course, if people have limited options that's a different thing entirely.

Right Livelihood to me means, in addition to those regulations you said, also means doing your best to work ethically. I don't think humanitarian work is worth much if you're an embezzler."

As someone descended from Mi'kmaq and Narragansett peoples that saved my main ethnic group from extinction, I'm pretty offended by the Washinton Redskins. And no one has the right to tell me what should or should not offend me. Seeing as we only just got our first Native American federal judge, we have a long ways to go when it comes to First Nations voices being heard.

I don't think your opinion has any merit and I don't see why it's worth fighting for the right to continue to use language that disempowers minorities. Like, honestly, is your stance that it's your right to ""not give a shit""?

Also, black people choosing to call themselves niggas &amp; etc is called ""reappropriation"", in which a group takes a word that was used to harm them and turns it to their own advantage. In such a situation, ""nigga"" is ONLY non-offensive when used by the group it describes. Any other situation is *still offensive*."
megawompwomp,TwoXChromosomes,1389631432.0,"Neither my boyfriend nor I want to do chores, but we recognize that they need to be done.  This is the method that worked for us:

* Sit down with your SO. Y'all really need to work on this together.
* Make a list of all household chores. Categorize them by frequency (daily, weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc.)
* Buy/print a monthly calendar.
* Write all chores on the calendar on/around the days that they need to be done.
* Find out which chores your SO absolutely hates to do, and you do the same. This gives you an idea of which chores shouldn't be assigned to a particular person. For example, I hate dusting and my SO hates laundry, so I do the laundry while he dusts the house. If you both hate a certain task, it's probably best to just alternate.
* Assign the rest of the tasks on an alternating basis. Perhaps you'll sweep the floors this week and he'll sweep them the next. Put names/initials next to each task until the month is assigned.
* Have time each week that is dedicated to getting chores done. If you're both working on getting your chores completed, it's a much easier task.
* Still not getting things completed in time? Get a large jar. Each time someone doesn't complete their chores, they put a set amount of money in it ($1, $5, etc.). Figure out what you want to do with it - I'd say that using it toward household expenses is a good idea, but that's totally up to you."

No, it won't all be roses and rainbows, it will probably be really hard for a while, but it will be better than being married to a stranger that you are trying to convince yourself to love because the alternative is too horrible to consider, that you will marry a stranger and then he will have sex with you and you will feel unable to escape if he turns out to be horrible.

Find the number of a local woman's shelter and call them. They may not be the right ones to help you, but they should be able to point you in the right direction if that is the case.

The question now, is how much you and you future happiness is worth. And I guarantee that you value yourself much less then you will in 10 years. What seems like a small sacrifice now will seem immeasurably worse as you get older and realize what you have lost.

That's an *inborn instinct* and to pretend that you can just *ignore the fucking instinct* (literally, the instinct and desire to fuck) by saying ""No sex till marriage and only then to have children."" is absolute lunacy. 

Now. Let's say I was born about 300 years ago, or even 100 years ago. I have nearly no sex drive, so keeping true to the church's teachings with regards to sex would be no problem for me. Maybe I wouldn't have a sense of empathy or the capacity to think rationally based on my observations of humans around me back then... so I would agree with the teachings and think they should apply to all. 


But that is absurd. Just. Patently absurd. The pope has no insight into how a society that could  -- if it weren't for his church's influence -- easily have access to birth control and education should function. 


tl;dr -- Almost all humans wanna fuck, the church ignores this, and their argument is thus fatally flawed. Society suffers by bringing children into the world that can't be taken care of properly because of it.

On this winter being particularly shitty, without knowing much about that (aside from winter = potholes) that does make a lot of sense.  There are just a few things that stick in my craw:

2) Ravenswood just south of Peterson has consistently been a shitshow since I moved to Ravenswood 2.5 years ago.  It's to the point that over the last 6 months I've seen people on a daily basis driving on the left side of the road and risking head-ons to avoid the dozens of potholes in that block.

rising_son,Guitar,1389631731.0,"Really? I have a DiMarzio Twang King singlecoil in my Tele's neck position and it sounds brilliant, EXTREMELY dynamic. It is NOT a noiseless pickup but is literally 5 times better than the stock pickups (Fender Select Telecaster Pickups). Perhaps you could give one of these a try? It's paired with a DiMarzio Fast Track T in the bridge. Demo sounds on my YouTube [Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lmrtAnJ8gk).

Edit: oh yeah make sure your Tele has it's cavities shielded with copper shielding, Fender don't do this to their guitars in the factory (for some reason) and it's a cheap and easy way of isolating the electronics a bit more than they already are. You can pick the stuff up on ebay or from most guitar component websites. It's easy to fit, it is self adhesive so you just cut pieces to size and fit them in. Stick a piece to the back of the pickguard around the place that is over the neck pickup cavity also. If you are in doubt I'm sure you can find some sort of guide on how to do it.

Hope this helps."

I use them for hours everyday, with a Fiio E7, to listen to music, and I don't regret the purchase one bit.

If you break your agreement to continue with the lease they keep it. This typically doesn't include you getting rejected from the apartment. The fact that it's a credit card makes it safer; the last time I had to do it was with cash.

The real reason they do this is that if you get rejected, or they give the lease to someone else, or it just straight-up never existed in the first place, they can drag their feet on giving you back your $500, or offer (how nice of them!) to just apply it to the next place you try to lease through them.

But, even in the vanilla game, look at how much range of ""difficulty"" can be accessed by the playing population: from the easiest difficulty setting to hardest, the game gets I think 16x more difficult in combat. That's over an order of magnitude difference. Granted on the easiest mode, the game is absurdly non-challenging, but on the hardest setting, it is legitimately hard to win fights if you don't know how to optimize your character *and* abuse the AI a bit.

mytenththrowaway,relationships,1389632458.0,"That's the challenge, though...that's ALWAYS the challenge- is to find the joy in the minutiae of everyday, not-pleasant stuff.  The needy kids, and the stressful workday, and the fleeting moments of togetherness spent doing things neither of you *really* wants to do.  Part of being super type-A is having the ability to get stuff done.  And that's an awesome quality to have.  But another, not so great side of that is plowing through the stuff that has to get done without really being present or appreciating it.  Has your therapist talked with you about being able to be in the moment?  Instead of living in the past (with the affair) or the future (when, hopefully, things will get better between you)?  

Those little moments, of diaper changes, of fixing dinner, of having five minutes together before one of you passes out from exhaustion...those moments ARE life, and when you're hard pressed to find any joy in them things can seem kind of, well, hopeless.  Maybe just grab him and give him a kiss next time one of you is playing referee and the other is cooking or cleaning, say 'love you', give him a big smile, and go back to what you were doing.

I caught the end of the beating from my dorm window on the third floor.  Several people, including myself, gave statements to the police describing what we saw.

The newspaper the next day had an article about the football players 'detaining a thief', and didn't say anything about the beating other than saying at the end of the article that the police recommend not trying to detain a thief.

megandharma,Anxiety,1389632715.0,"Yes. I was bullied in elementary school for a few years, grades 2 through 5. Unfortunately, children at that age don't realize how powerful their actions can be, but now that I'm older I can look back and be okay with what happened because we were kids. That doesn't change who I am though which is unfortunate.

I went to elementary school in a suburb outside Salt Lake City, UT. I'm part asian and my family is not mormon and we didn't go to church. I also wore glasses and had acne flare up in grade 5. There was one other asian in my class and I think maybe one black family in the entire school. I am also female. As a result, I suffered a lot of racial and religious tension. However, at our age these kids really didn't understand what they were doing, but just taking influence from their parents/families and bringing it into the school. 

Things started out okay. I had a few girl friends, but as time went by those girl friends formed a clique which became the popular circle of girls. This is where things got bad. The girls would toy with me. Act like my friend outside of school, but then bully me inside of school. Sometimes they would give a little while in school, but then the next day treat me like dirt. It really messed with me psychologically. It became really hard for me to trust people and make friends after experiencing all of that. I even went through having ""cooties"" in fourth and fifth grade. I kind of feel like that was a bit old for that treatment, but whatever.

My family moved across the country in the end, which solved a lot of those problems. I still have a hard time making friends even at my age. I find that maybe it's even harder now that I'm in my mid twenties. Now, I'm constantly worried about how other people feel. ""Is what I'm doing okay for you?"" ""Am I making you uncomfortable?"" ""I'm not imposing am I?"" I have a really hard time thinking about myself now. Therapy is helping a bit, but it's probably the hardest thing I've tried to do in a long time.

namer98,Christianity,1389632742.0,"&gt;And, even better: God walking (Gen 3:8) and talking with Adam &amp; Eve.

The verse hear talks about the voice of God, and it mentions during the ""wind"" of the day. I don't have the list on me, but a commentary says that we see the wind referring to non-physical objects in around six or so other places in the text.

&gt;Jacob wrestling God (Gen 32:22-32)

The start of the text is explicit about a person. But then says ""you wrestled with God"". It is an apparent contradiction. One we can solve by saying the angel is a test from God. It should also be noted that Jacob was there because he had left a piece of pottery behind, even though he appears to be well off when he talks to Esau. Why should a rich man care about a piece of pottery? Because when you are serving God, every little piece of string matters. And this is the test we see Jacob undergo. Not one of belief, but one of following through.

&gt;The Lord's visitation to Abraham and Sarah (Gen 18)

The text here can be understood in a few ways. The common Jewish one is that Abraham is talking to God and then the visitors come and Abraham tells God ""wait a second, I got to take care of this"". For a more in depth on variant Jewish understandings, my Rabbi recorded a lecture [here](http://www.torahdownloads.com/shiur-24235.html)"

These are women that have been marginalized their entire lives. They have been rejected by men and the media for years because of their weight. So then they find these communities where they are praised and made to feel beautiful for the very thing that has hurt them all these years.


It's a place where they feel accepted, and loved. And the women that have been there for years have created this idea that there's nothing wrong with being fat because they can't live with the idea that *they're* doing something wrong.

Then the younger members come in, see these older influential women that have men falling all over them, and they become indoctrinated. There are many male and female members that do ""research"" into HAES ideals, and prop it up as fact.

What happens with that is that they're turning a sexual fetish into a 'legitimate' belief with false research. They go from being idolized by fat admirers, to seeing themselves as Social Justice Warriors that are working for the betterment of mankind. 

No one wants to admit that it's a giant echo-chamber of false ideals, because to do so would admit that they're just fat chicks who don't want to work to be considered sexy, so they accept the praise of fat admirers as a poor substitute."

Micelight,WritingPrompts,1389632947.0,"When derelict mining equipment of unknown origins was discovered deep in a supposedly lifeless part of the galaxy our governing council naturally assumed an illegal incursion had occurred by pirates. Found on hollowed out asteroids and micro planets with no sun to tether them from hurtling through space, the primitive nature of the gear leveled the notice down to a “file and dismiss” case and had it not been for a curious archivist, we’d probably be none the wiser about the complex extremophiles proclaimed as ‘humans.’

What had been overlooked by the supposedly wise leaders was the inscriptions on the Iron-Chromium (an exceedingly redundant alloy surpassed years ago), an unknown language that a single archivist pored over for the better part of his maturation – all the while rising through the ranks to become Leader of Information. A hobby in his free time, several rotations of mediating spats between emerging species and their own petty factions saw him come closer to translating the 26 character alphabet into a sensical language. A language of a presumably dead race, but a language nonetheless.

But then, something was found.  Careening out of a ‘dead’ sector came a single device, it’s signal barely transmitting, a reconnaissance craft had mistaken it as an unidentified stealth probe and entered immediate pursuit through an asteroid field (we had initially assumed that it’s trajectory was a purposeful attempt to destroy the ‘technology’). Captured, it was returned to the Capitol in utmost secrecy, the cargo hold of the now high echelon craft remaining sealed until who should open it, but yours truly.

As the Leader of Information the supposed nature of this craft fell under my jurisdiction. A weapon, a prototype design, intelligence – all was mine to analyse and integrate into computations to predict outcomes and origins simultaneously. Externally, this device gave no clues as to what category of risk it fell under, rather, in proud black lettering it spoke it’s name in a disturbingly familiar language. VOYAGER-1. Out of the thousands of languages I am familiar with none could express the discomfort and irrational fear I felt at that moment, circling the design of an extinct race, and coming across a neatly placed golden disc. Such visibility was no doubt intentional by the engineers of the Voyager, and with a neat pop it fell into my palm with ease. I recognised the design – or at least, the concept. I spied the canyons of differing depths etched into each surface, forming a centric ring of waveforms that produced noise when appropriately mantled (a ‘record,’ as we came to know it as. There is no mistranslation here; their language uses so many overlapping meaning for the same words that context must be drawn into account). Such technology was old, incredibly old, described-only-in-history-archives-old. Of the type of design that was on par with the wheel in terms of communication technology.

As strange as it sounded, our engineers entertained the notion of their leader and produced a “phonograph” to decode the ‘record.’


Here is where contention arises between what we found, and what we publically released. The population of the United Species Directorate (have mercy) would have you believe that upon activation of the record the sounds produced were so foreign, so painful because of the pitches used, that we weaponised the frequencies at which the noises operated. Ha! Granted, the concept of using it as crowd control wasn’t a bad one, as you’ll soon see. As the first few moments of the record played we were met by a multitude of distinctly organic tongues, conversing to us in different dialects (55 different voices in total!) before proceeding onto a variety of presumably commonplace sounds. My engineers were looking at each other, some excitedly trying to replicate them with whatever tools they could find – others recognising the noise frequencies from their maturation studies (for all our effort, all we could identify were foot falls, hammers striking steel , the signature of a pulsar and a volcanic eruption). The team was ecstatic hearing the calls of an unknown civilisation for the first time, and excitedly leaned in for the next segment of the record.

We weren’t prepared. We heard – *“music.”*

Allow me to backtrack a little on that note. My species, all known species up until that point, had had our earliest ancestors struggle to survive. The preoccupation of finding nutrients on a weekly basis on a hostile ice world (Ice in our sense of the word - liquid Carbon Dioxide) led not time to simple pleasures beyond procreation. Our obsessing over deities had consumed surplus resources in carving enormous likenings , and somewhere along the line like many other species, we had missed the ‘gift’ of music. No bone carved flutes. No skin drums. Not even the beauty of a voice varying in pitch. All our faculties were targeted against threats in order to survive. Noise was a clue – always (a good example I can find is that heartbeat to us indicates health only – a heartbeat to a human can be construed as health indicator and as a soothing rhythm, especially to infants. Go figure, as they say).

Being exposed to purposefully pleasurable pitch variations for the first time was… unique. An orgasm of sensation enlightening a sense once solely dedicated to survival, such erratic and beautifully orchestrated sounds would by themselves fail to inspire but together altered our moods and emotions beyond our control. The engineers were transfixed on the spinning golden disc as if watching it would pry more sounds from it. Hours, and hours and hours passed as we sat alone listening to such incredible intricacy crafted from vibrations. Euphoria doesn’t come close to describing it, and my earlier notions of fear regarding this race was dispelled. In that same moment, I came to a conclusion: I had to find them. These craftsmen of sound who could make my skin flush cold and my face hot in ways not known out of an entire Directorate encompassing all the known species in this galaxy!

* *Choose* to be happier.  How you do this is up to you, whether it's ""I'm so fucking sick of being cynical!"" or happy love hippie vibes, it doesn't matter.  **Be positive because you choose to.**

* When talking to others, choose to express happier, more positive things.  Use positive words, and encourage others to do so also.  Don't force it down people's throats, of course; sometimes all it takes is to just be *chill.*  WWtDD: What Would the Dude Do?

* Do things that create dopamine in your brain.  Smile more.  Exercise.  Monitor your dietary input (ie avoid sugar crashes and hungry grumbles).   Hang out with friends, help other people, be around happier people, and so on.

All of these things will inform and build upon each other, so you have to move forward on all three fronts.  You don't have to be ""I'M SUPER, THANKS FOR ASKING!"" or a happy fucking ray of sunshine all the time, but building a positive outlook is an important skill to have.

Hopefully more activity this afternoon - that'll be exciting (What do I do if it isn't?). The next couple days are expected to be hot, but it's out in the garage and the temperature should be moderate.

This being my first brew, I also had the step of saving on my pop-top bottles for the last year or so (I don't drink a ton), so I put them all in the bathtub with warm water to soak so I could get the labels off. Then I forgot about them for several hours, the water drained, and they all dried off. I did that three or four times. Oops. I guess I have two weeks now to do something about them. What's the best way to clean bottles? Once the labels are off, I was thinking of running them through the dishwasher, and then rinsing in c-brite.

Also, it's not really brewing, but last night I started working on an orange liqueur. That should be nice in a couple of weeks.

My SOs have typically wanted to figure out whose fault it was or put the blame somewhere (even if it's on themselves), but why?  It's just going to make someone mad or make someone feel bad.  I never want to blame anyone - all I want to do is find a solution and then follow through with it.

&gt;arguing over the particulars of who's fault it is, he starts to get very f'ed off, it turns to shouting, I get upset and we retreat to other rooms whilst he is pissed off and I'm upset

If you didn't do this, you could skip right to resolution, seriously.  No one's perfect, right?  You're both going to make mistakes.  So what is anyone accomplishing by finding out whose fault it is?  All it does is allow one person to make the other feel bad.  

Either that, or it's a way to punish the other.  I mean, think about most other instances where you would *want* to place the blame (or at least, kind of have to).  As a kid, you don't want to be punished, so if it's your sister's fault, you bet your ass you're putting the blame on her.  In school growing up, if someone is causing trouble, you're not getting detention for what *they* did.  And at work, you're not losing your job because some asshat did something that you got in trouble for.  Blame is pretty important.  But in a relationship, who are you punishing?  You're SO?

I believe that this should only be considered after the abused person has developed boundaries, and is able to forgive that person without letting them into their well-established boundaries. Instead I think it's better to focus on not letting their abuse define you or determine your worth. You can do this without being angry. "

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389633250.0,"&gt;Why are women often held to lower standards of moral responsibility than men?

They aren't. Women are held to far higher moral standards in our society, even if we are to play oppression olympics.

&gt;Why does the promiscuity double standard (the stud/slut dichotomy) exist?

It's an integral part of patriarchy to discourage sexual autonomy amongst women.

&gt;What explains the relative level of acceptance of female 'tomboy' children versus that experienced by insufficiently gender-conforming male children?

Because the gender of women is highly disadvantaged in our society, thus any male bodied child who would seek to identify as more feminine ""must be confused"". Also, the women gender generally exists for men to be able to identify sexual partners, and to confuse them by having a male bodied individual dressing or acting like a woman infringes upon this procedure. Thus, within the confines of a patriarchal system, such activity is discouraged, whereas female bodied people who act masculine do not necessarily disrupt this process since it is usually easy enough to be able to identify their sexual organs and thus be able to recognize them as a potential sexual partner."

I'm almost done with the form when the manager -- who hasn't ever bothered to talk to any of us in six weeks -- steps out of his office and starts yelling at me.  He gets rights up in my face, telling me that my language is inappropriate.  He's pissed to, all red-faced and shouting, trying to intimidate me.

She has to do it when she is ready. Pushing her to do it will result in her doing it to please you, not herself which may lead to failure. 

&gt; Should I tell her I don't think she is ready?

Tell her that you didn't mean to pressure her and that it is okay if she isn't interested in joining you right now. 

&gt; I am also afraid that her seeming unwillingness to be an engaged fitness buddy will bring down my attempts, and I have enough issues with bringing my own self down. Any advice, Loseit? Any experience with this? 

Having support is nice but you may have to find someone that wants to join you. In the past my husband wanted me to join him but I wasn't interested instead of us doing it ourselves we both quit. We find that working out separately then checking in and dieting together works better for us.

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1389633504.0,"It's been deemed unnecessary pretty recently and many doctors tend to be skeptical of new changes like that from what I've seen.  Generally what I've heard from doctors is that new information comes out very often and sometimes a bit more time says that said new information was wrong, but they would prefer to wait to get more years backing it in clinical.

I mean, I'm happy to complain about routine doctor stuff that comes along with medication.  I take TONS of medication and have so much routine work that goes along with it that it feels like a part time job.  However, I understand the reasoning why it happens.  I work to find doctors that will listen to concerns I have and be open to trying some new information.  However, since I am in the situation of having so many RX meds and routine checks I feel 100% confident saying that it isn't just a women's issue only related to birth control.  It's the routine that goes along with any medication that has potential side effects.

The pap smears to get it is part of an overall system for health related things.  If I want my migraine meds I have to go through the neurological tests every so often even though they have never been helpful.  It's a check they set in place.  If I want some of my other meds I have to do frequent blood work.  If I want my bladder stuff I have to have fairly regular screenings on that ""just to see.""  I have two controlled substance scripts and the hell to get those is a whole different ball of wax.

louisc,webdev,1389633733.0,"Digital Ocean allows you to set up Ghost with a snapshot image they provide. Setup is literally just starting up a new droplet with the ""Ghost"" image. Amazon is more DIY. As for integration, on either platform you will need to manage and upgrade your Ghost installation yourself, since Ghost has no automatic updater and DO doesn't provide one.

Ghost also provides a very affordable hosted platform. It's essentially the same as running your own independent ghost install, only you don't have to manage it. The downside is that you cannot modify any files yourself, but you can upload a theme directory to use (with your modification inside). Right now there are no plugins, but I'm sure the hosted platform will allow you to upload those once they're supported.

I myself manage my own ghost install on Digital Ocean. Their droplet is based on ubuntu, and I personally prefer Debian. The hosted platform, at $5/month to start, is a decent price, but I prefer a hands-on approach. Plus running my own box allows me to test-drive new Ghost versions and help with bug reports and whatnot."

viceywicey,AskMen,1389633737.0,"A trick I like to use if the fight gets out of hand, is to say, right in the middle of it all, ""I'm going to the bathroom to take a shit (or a piss).  If you want to continue yelling at me, you're welcome to follow me.  Otherwise, give me like 10 minutes and we can resume.""  Experience has taught me that it is often hard to be angry while leaving a stinker and the silence gives me time to think about what happened, why it happened, and how stupid it was for me to be angry.

Ultimately though, it depends on how you argue and how he argues.  When you argue do you focus on the fault and flaw or do you struggle with how to express what is you feel or do either of you have difficulty understanding the other?  Does he ever ask to pause or stop the fight so he can stabilize his mood and reassess?  Do you ever ask for the same?

More often than not, the quickest solution to any fight is to just stop the fight so you can calm down instead of allowing it to escalate to where you're both at your breaking points.  Judging from what you've indicated in your post it seems to me that arguments tend to discuss ""fault"" as opposed to ""how to move forward"" or ""It would mean a lot to me if we could compromise on x, y, and z.  I don't know exactly how, but I want to work through it WITH you, together.""

As emotions get heated, arguments tend to derail from the point (""You always just leave the dishes in the sink!"") and shift towards attacks on the individual and their ""motivations"" behind this (""just stop being lazy and clean them up!  I'm not your mother and shouldn't have to pick up after you!"").  I realize that my example is somewhat one-sided, but this naturally goes both ways. A fight should instead be exploratory: ""how do we move past this?"" and ""what can we do"" as opposed to ""what can you/I do?""  Sometimes all it takes is a few moments of total silence where you both can reflect on how stupid you were."

0x_,offmychest,1389633794.0,"&gt; What was actually radical about him?

Well, i've seen Malcolm X argue for extremism, and i've heard more moderate ideas come from MLK.

Amongst his more radical notions, he said that nonviolence was the ""philosophy of the fool"", wanted an independent black nation, not a multiculturalist and equal society, he rejected milestones like the march on washington as a farce.

While radicals can service a movement by spearheading an overton window effect of sorts, it can also be detrimental to one to downplay radicalism, rather than use it as contrast.

You already highlight his much less radical ideas, great ideas, his radicalism doesn't detract from those ideas at all, in fact it sometimes takes radical thinking in order to come to some novel perspectives on a situation, such as self-reliance and self-determination, you could call that a moderate implementation for any marginalized people within a society, of a radical notion like separatism. 

Its a tragedy he was assassinated. I would have loved to have seen where this most eloquent, intelligent and righteous of radical thinkers, would have taken his philosophy, once he stepped back from radicalism and engaged with evolutionary change within the system.

Although he compared himself with a ventriloquists dummy, or a zombie, during his time in the nation of islam, its hard to say that Malcolm X was defined by the year before his assassination, after leaving the NOI, or his 12 years as a NOI member.

&gt; Meanwhile, Martin Luther King Jr. didn't work within the system, he disrupted it.

You're conflating his methods of protest, of disruption, not violence, with his goals. His goals were multicuralism and equality, within the system, within society. This makes him a moderate. Equality is not really a radical notion, while separatism is.

&gt; ...people saw blacks being beaten and killed and whites right there with them. Something had to be done. That's a lot more radical...

...more effective, more compromising, more moderate. Not radical. Moderation and accomplishment are not mutually exclusive. ""Radical"" and ""moderate"" are not about results, they're about goals and methods, more accurately described as revolutionary and evolutionary."

So_Full_Of_Fail,FordRaptor,1389633877.0,"To be honest, I'd be happy with the 3.5/5.0 ecoboost.

It's significantly easier to squeeze a little more power out of something that was factory turbo'd than an N/A motor.

Compared to other stuff, the 6.2 has next to no aftermarket support.  It's too expensive to buy one, the 2 plugs/hole makes it illegal for some class racing and it's not in cars.  There *is* potential as shown by the ford/roush ""777"" development motor that was campaigned for a couple years in a NMRA car.

Hopefully, aftermarket support comes up for the 3.5 ecoboost.

Unfortunately, with CAFE requirements, small displacement boosted motors is going to be the way of the future, compared to the big cube very inefficient V8s.

Edit:  I also have some hope that with Formula 1 going back to turbo engines some new technology will come out of it in the coming years."

A lot of this has to do with the body's natural mutation repair mechanisms and their capacity for dealing with repairs; at some point, the number of cells experiencing ionizing radiation mutations is so great that one or two cells slip through where the repair mechanisms failed.

Jalapenyobuisness,WritingPrompts,1389634141.0,"It was Friday night. Which to me, means Poker night. To most people it's nothing special, maybe time to unwind after work and get drunk, but its when me, Yyrsthrak, Obin, and Deerman (not his actual name, I can't pronounce it and neither can Yyrsthrak) meet up for a game of high stakes Texas Hold 'Em. I'll admit, Texas is pretty fucked up. But holy shit do they know how to play cards.

Anyway, so I was hosting tonight. Last week it was Obin. He always throws a good party, plenty of food and drink. And he has this caste of priests who still sacrifice animals to him. They taste like chicken, which I have determined is the universal standard for good but bland. 

Yyrsthrak is the first to show up, he always is. He's a pretty chill guy, looks like a blob of slime but that blob of slime has a mean poker face. Obin looks like a scorpion had sex with a spider which had sex with a snake. A fuckton of legs, scales, and a stinger on the ass. He can't bluff to save his life, but is a lucky son of a bitch. Deerman looks like a, you guessed it, deer with arms. Ten fingers too, on each hand. They're really long and thin, but super dexterous. He can deal faster than you can blink, but never cheats. Or, we've never caught him cheating and we don't *think* he cheats, but to be honest he could probably be switching out cards all the time. 

Me? I'm Yahweh. God. Not Allah, to be specific. That Mohammed was just a nut. I mean really, marrying a nine year old? Anyways, whatever you want to call me, I'm the Judeo-Christian supreme being. Jesus is hanging out with Paul and Michael, so its just me and the guys tonight. 

We start sitting down and Deerman starts dealing. There *should* be a language barrier, but because we're all gods, well, you know. Its kinda a non issue. We aren't betting money you understand, because it has no value. Instead we bet natural disasters, inventions, that sort of thing. The ante is a Tidal Wave or the equivalent thereof. Obin's world doesn't really have oceans per say, more of just a lot of small lakes. Its really cool to look at, or it would be if it weren't surrounded by hyper-aggressive aliens. I'm a little worried about what will happen when the humans finally meet up with the Obinites, but then again the humans are pretty aggressive too. 

Next comes the banter. It's my favorite part of the night. I casually toss a Great Awakening into the pot, and Yyrsthrak sucks in like a human would suck air through their teeth.

""Ooh, big man tonight. Whatcha packing Yahweh?""

""Oh nothing much Yyrsthrak, but you'll have to toss something big in there to cover that."" 

""Ah come on, you guys have already had like, four Great Awakenings. That's worth maybe an Industrial Revolution.""

""Don't be ridiculous"" Obin interjected. ""That's like one New World. Tops.""

""Yeah, you're right."" I replied.

Yyrsthrak tossed a New World into the pot, and Obin thought for a moment before raising him Space Travel.

""Big spender!"" Deerman smirked, before calling Obin's Space Travel with a laugh. 

I don't know what they have, but I have a six and ten of clubs. Deerman flops, and I keep my expression carefully neutral. He put out an eight, a nine, and a jack. All of clubs. I scratch my chin, before tossing in Mathematics. The rest of the gods looked dirtily at me.

""Oh that's just pathetic. Mathematics. Please."" 

I roll my eyes and toss Advanced Physics in on top of it to mollify them, and signal to Yyrsthrak that it was his turn to bet.

He threw in a Great Flood, which took the rest of us aback quite a bit. I looked askance at Obin, who looked back at me. Then all of us looked at Yyrsthrak. 

""You hiding something in your hand there buddy?""

Yyrsthrak just grinned and said nothing. His gelatinous face gave nothing away other than what he wanted, so I was forced just to rely on judgement. Obin grumbled and tossed his cards in, folding. I think carefully. I'm one card away from a straight flush of clubs. A Queen or a Seven and I'm as good as gold. Yyrsthrak makes a gargling laugh as Deerman follows suit. Now it's just me and Yyrsthrak, who has returned to a structured neutral expression.

I call, to his and everyone else's surprise. Deerman shrugs and burns a card, followed by a fourth street. A Queen of hearts. I decided to stay in on a hunch, and threw a Cult Following into the pot. 

Yyrsthrak laughs and follows suit with a Industrial Revolution, which I follow with a Beneficial Mutation, which he calls.

Then Deerman burns the final card and puts out the river. A seven of clubs. I check, and Yyrsthrak follows suit. He puts out his cards, an ace and a four of clubs. He grins, a flush.

I grin back, and put out my cards. His face falls, and he groans out loud. I laughed and took the whole pot, as Deerman starts to shuffle. 

Its good to be a god, but its better to have friends."

raziphel,getting_over_it,1389634183.0,"One tip: try to ""automate"" certain small tasks.  Some of these you can do with actual automation, like scheduled transfers into a savings account (for a downpayment on a house), and some you have to just start and work on for a few weeks until it becomes a habit.  Some are obviously harder than others, but scheduling things makes it easier.  Use google calendar to set re-occuring reminders helps.

Small steps are easiest to change.  For example, I've been working on eating better, so I started buying bananas for breakfast.  Now, whenever I go to the grocery store, I pick up a few.  Kicking soda (again) is next.

You know that old adage ""fall down four times, stand up five""?  Learning to get back on track when (not if) you backslide is a seriously important skill to have, so don't beat yourself up too much if you have a setback.  It's just a speed bump, after all."

&gt;Figure out what you're doing to piss your boyfriend off, and stop doing it.

We don't even know whose fault it really is, but in the end, it's not about that.  It's about how to have a calm argument without resulting in a shouting match that results in the two of them not speaking for an hour.  Why are you so quick to place the blame, and why is that so important?  She's not even trying to place the blame - she said that he makes accusations, she gets defensive, then they both react emotionally until they can cool off. They're both responsible, and she wants to know how to make it better.  Telling her not to piss him off honestly does sound like projection.

While my mind floats freely, I get up, shower, and do my chores. 


It helps because instead of *thinking* about how hard my chores are, I'm just *doing* them. My house is cleaner, my attitude is better, and I spend way less time caring about stupid little things that cause my anxiety, the things that (rationally) should not matter.

1. I imagine that the soul begins unformed and collects data over time by association.
    1. Orcs went from being monsters who would have had white souls to sentient who have black between TESII and TESIII. Yet Orcs themselves have been kept sentient throughout history, as far as we can glean from sources (Incl. ESO). So that is an obstacle in determining if a black soul causes or is caused by high minds.
    1. A sufficiently determined mage can do anything he wants. This is a universe where theologians literally rewrote the Time God for all of existence because they were unhappy with the previous one. Manipulating soul energy suddenly doesn't seem as impossible.

    1. Possible.
1. Dreamsleeve is just a path; a literal information highway. Reincarnation is deliberately keeping some information on the soul prior to investiture. ""Dremora's rebirth?"" Daedra don't die easily. I assume that in keeping with the theme in my linked post, they have black souls because of coordinated destruction, but Daedra when killed just dissociate and reform as themselves. Think of afterlives as exits from the highway. Souls stay there, so the souls cycling through Mundus may one day run out. http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11vcrs/when_the_dreamsleeve_runs_dry/ concerns that. It's a standing rule passively kept, not an actively maintained function, so yes.

Male masturbation is openly joked about - ""dude, my wrist hurts!"" phrases like ""jerkin' it"" and ""whacking one off"" are openly expressed - whereas female masturbation never seems to be discussed in any capacity in the public sphere. 

Online porn sites readily feature female masturbation videos, so it seems that the private, internet sphere makes up for this lack of/taboo of female masturbation. The problem with this, however, is that those watching the videos take female masturbation to be as it is in online porn, not knowing how intimate, personal, and varied it really is. 

You always hear about how boys start pleasuring themselves at an early age, but the same is never said about girls. For the longest time, I thought only boys did that to themselves, and that I wasn't normal. MY SO (m/22) told me once of a time when he was ~14 that him and his friends were discovering porn and masturbated together to it.

Diego Costa has the numbers, the 'plays in La Liga' exotic aspect and doesn't do much outside of scoring goals, which makes him an elite predator instead of limited.

Plus, it's rare that an Arsenal fan would watch Atletico games and go in to them looking for Costa's faults. They're going to go in looking at it from a 'How is he better than Giroud? point of view. So they see something nice and think ""Giroud would never do that!"" even though it's not even true.

Heck, I wish there  was some sort of referendum the people could have to completely disintegrate congress as is, where we can elect a new one the next election cycle (say, everyone currently in is barred from running for 10 years or something). Obviously, to avoid abuse, we'd need a supermajority to make it happen, say, 75% or something, but given how unpopular this congress is, it could easily happen past the 75% mark at this point. This would be totally nonpartisan in nature. Everyone would go, and everyone would elect new officials of their choosing, likely of the same political persuasion of the last guy.

Yes and no. 

There's nothing wrong with /r/trueblackfathers and battling negative stereotypes. You are however in a thread about offensive jokes specifically. So the jokes here are going to be related to tired racist, sexist stereotypes and things that are just plain vile. 

Of course the humor mostly comes from shock value, the cleverness in which we use the stereotype and the notion that we don't actually think in this way and find such thinking to be primitive and humorous.

And no we're not oblivious to the fact that there are people out there who really think this way but I don't think we should stop having fun just because some people are idiots. 

Honestly I think this kind of cultural teasing is good for us as a civilization. It's like teasing your friends or family. It's a form of bonding. If you set up all these rules and barriers to how we're allowed to interact with each other then being friends becomes to much trouble. People avoid each other. People know less about each other and ignorance devolves into resentment and hatred.

An alternative is to write a letter by hand, that is if you are a bit of a writer. This gives you the ability to organize your thoughts and let you say what you really want to. You say you were vague in emails, but try writing a letter without the vagueness and see how that feels to you. Then, if you feel comfortable enough, give it to him.

If they persisted and asked ""what if you count the ones you don't count"", my response would be ""I don't count them"".  If they couldn't accept that answer, they probably weren't right for me.

If you are a PMO'er, do a little reading about the realities of porn, the people behind the cameras, objectification, how it is damaging our society, as well as how viewing porn on a regular basis can damage your brain (Dopamine addictions are REAL). Your best chance at starting and sticking to it is to not hate yourself if you relapse, and to fill your life with motivation, reasons to stick to it. Realize that the sickness in the world caused by human trafficking, child pornography, prostitution, all of it needs to change, and it starts with people unhinging their selves from sex/masturbation addiction and becoming in control of their urges.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389634689.0,"With the idea of personhood, I don't think it's necessary to afford a human body that is brain dead any rights, going with the current state of medicine wherein we cannot bring back a person from such a state.

I postulate that for a human being to be a person they have to have some sort of personality. Some sort of coherent entity that interacts with the world. I believe that if you were to remove the parts of the brain that facilitate the existence of a personality, you have a husk that is most certainly alive but has nothing that exemplifies a person. I do think that they have *a priori* rights and thus should not be violated (e.g. euthanizing a brain dead individual that did not give prior consent to such), but I think that something has to acquire that state first, or - something must first become a person before they are afforded the rights.

I think the modification is justified because in the case of a fetus, we know that at least in the 1st trimester they don't have a functioning central nervous system. They can't think or feel, and so they're a collection of cells that are the prototype for a human and a person, but are not at that stage yet. I think if we're going to try and make analogies as accurate as possible, we should modify them accordingly. In the case of your unmodified one, then no I would not take the job.

We have the certainty that they do not have ""personhood"" in any meaningful way that we understand it currently. I concede that there might be other ways of having ""personhood"", but I've yet to see any evidence that supports this notion."

&gt;I'll advocate for people to make sure to remark on legit posts being downvoted...but I'd like you to agree on helping to eradicate all of the unfair inferences that are made about ""bitter short men"" who downvote everything in sight

Done. I try to, and will continue to try to.

I agree. We can all only do as much as we can. But I think that we can affect some amount of change, even if it's in small ways, or piece by piece. Sure, it won't be a utopia, but we can definitely largely avoid a lot of the kinds of drama that happen."

We drove for about 5 days and settled in two scenic areas, Seaside and Newport, if I remember correctly. It was one of those 'hop in the car and bring a map and a change of clothes with you' type of road trips. Forgot the camera charger and the change of clothes.

Here's the [album](https://imgur.com/a/M2Nl9) which was taken with a potato phone. 

I want to go back to Oregon, I want to listen to whale calls and taste more fudge from Tillamook. I want to put on a wet suit and dive in the freezing cold waters. Definitely go wine tasting at every vineyard along the way. I want to drive across the Astoria Bridge into Washington state..SEATTLE!! 

Then I want to make a U-Turn and head on over to Montana. Before leaving Oregon; however, I'm going back to the little chinese restaurant in a podunk country western town at the border. Where they serve massive plates of delicious Chinese food. 

I want to see Yellowstone in the fall or on the cusp of winter.  Summer was a little too hot for me. This time around, I'd want to stay at a mountain lodge and drink hot chocolate on the balcony that overlooks the park.

Bigman61,AdviceAnimals,1389634834.0,"I love how whenever this is mentioned you get the people saying that spanking isn't wrong but you can get the same results by talking and using other methods. I've never once see a screaming child listen to their parent but once they get that spanking shit gets serious and they shut the fuck up. It works and it's quicker and simpler than attempting to explain why what they did was wrong to a person who doesn't fully comprehend language.

Now I don't have children yet but once I do I'll probably eventually spank them.

namer98,Judaism,1389634836.0,"Article text for those that cannot see:

A Women of the Wall splinter group is taking its first independent steps to mark its official break from the pluralistic women’s prayer group.

The splinter group, which rejected the board’s decision to consider moving Women of the Wall’s monthly prayer service from the women’s section of the Western Wall to a new egalitarian space nearby, will be holding its first prayer service of its own at the Kotel this Friday. It has also assumed its own name: “Original Women of the Wall” or the abbreviated version ”O-WOW.”

The prayer service at the Kotel this week is scheduled to mark the holiday of Tu Bishvat, which falls on Thursday.

Several months ago, at the urging of its Chairwoman Anat Hoffman, the Women of the Wall board decided in an 8-2 vote to negotiate with the government the possibility of moving to the new egalitarian section, in exchange for acquiescence to a long list of demands. These demands included equal space and equal funding for the new section as well as representation on the new authority that would be charged with administering it. The government has yet to respond to these demands. Moreover, the special government committee that was created to present recommendations on resolving the ongoing conflict over prayer rules at the Western Wall, headed by Cabinet Secretary Avichai Mandelblit, has yet to publish its report.

O-WOW was formed by a group of several dozen women, among them founding members of Women of the Wall who believe that negotiating a move to the new egalitarian space would spell a victory for the ultra-Orthodox groups who have been trying to force the women’s prayer group out of the women’s section. The ultra-Orthodox object to various practices in which some members of the women’s prayer group engage, such as wearing prayer shawls and phylacteries, and praying out loud.

Most of the members of the splinter group live in the United States.

Cheryl Birkner Mack, an Israeli-based representative of O-WOW, said she expected between 15 to 20 women to participate in Friday’s inaugural service, among them former Women of the Wall board member Aliza Berger-Cooper and Shulamit Magnus, one of the American founders of Women of the Wall, who is moving to Israel shortly.

“Just as Women of the Wall started as a small group and grew, so will we,” said Birkner Mack.

She said the O-WOW planned to continue convening in the women’s section of the Kotel, but not on a regular basis. “We’ll probably have our next service on International Women’s Day in March, and after that we hope to get together to mark yahrzeits [death anniversaries] and other events,” she said.

In response, Women of the Wall spokeswoman Shira Pruce said: “There’s only one Women of the Wall. We’re a registered non-profit, and we’re the ones who have been fighting all the legal battles of the past 25 years. Coopting the name in this way is just an attempt to ride on the wave of our success. But we certainly have no objection to more women praying at the wall. In fact, the more the merrier. “"

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389634932.0,"I disagree that they have enough talent, at least considering how the league looks right now.  

Miami has the best player in the league, another top 10 player, plus a roster full of high quality role players.  Though their role players aren't elite all-around, many have elite talents.

Indiana has a top 5 player and easily the most talented defensive team in the league.  I think anyone on that Indiana team could make the All-Defensive team and I wouldn't be shocked.  

San Antonio may not have a top 5 (or even top 10 player), but they do have an amazing coach and a deep team that plays consistently and within their skillsets.  When crunch time comes, Parker can perform like the best guard in the league and Duncan can play like the best big in the league.  

The Thunder have the second best player in the league and arguably another top 5 player to boot.  They might be the least talented serious contender and I think they're still more talented than Houston.  

You might be able to make a case for Harden, but I don't think Houston has a top 5 player.   Howard hasn't been playing like the best center in the league this year, so I don't think he has a case to be considered a top 10 player.  Either way, the best players on Houston aren't as good as the best players on other contenders.  Beyond that, their bench isn't as well built as the other teams.  They don't have an elite perimeter defender, a leader on the bench that can carry a second unit, an elite coach or proven vets with championship experience.  I think you need all of those things to have a serious chance at contending this year.  "

They're aimed at people that go occasionally to a game, maybe one in their lifetime, to hang them on their walls and tell to friends about that one time they went to see united.

The populace didn't meet an Orc woman LDB; they met an LDB who could have been an Orcs woman. Or an Argonian man. Or anything. The mythic status is so overwhelmingly powerful that their personality is irrelevant, and this is accented by the Aurbis choosing Prisoners. Every game, people have to ask what race you are, because it is wholly unknowable when that status is conferred. Letters refer to your name, but ink flows freely. Spoken word never does, for your true name is power unspeakable (save Dovahkiin, which is only evoked by Greybeards and Dragons) and you are referred to as vagaries.

DeathIsTruth,AskReddit,1389635165.0,"I found reddit in 09. Before this I spent a lot of time going back and forth from gizmodo, engadget, life hacker, stumble upon and YouTube.

Borror0,CanadaPolitics,1389635166.0,"In Quebec, a person earning $857.14/month wouldn't benefit from welfare. Welfare recipients are granted a $604/month benefit and are allowed to gain an extra $200/month through work. Past that amount, each additional dollar is automatically removed from the sum. 

As a working poor, however, the poor worker qualifies for the Working Income Tax Credit. Assuming a full year of working at $857.14/month, the worker would qualify for [a $1,599 benefit](http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/icwb/witb/witb-e?taxYear=2013). To that amount, you have to add an additional $167.25 from the GST rebate (which may or may not include the TVQ rebate). 

Now, I'm not a tax expert - I will eventually have to sit with one of my accountant friends for a few tax lessons as that's a domain that interests me - so these amounts may not be strictly accurate. The important part is the presence of amounts. Unlike what you claimed, our structure already does support the working poor the moment they exit welfare. There is a debate to be had over whether the support is sufficient, over whether it's designed optimally and over whether it'd be optimal in a post-minimum wage Canada, but there's a structure there to build upon.

Even if the above wasn't true, even if your point was correct, proponents of the minimum wage still have to defend after the rather popular view that the social structure is suboptimally designed. "

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389635196.0,"i feel that i thrive the best on a total lack of structure, but since this almost never exists in places outside my own imagination life often feels like a balancing act between the structures imposed upon me by other people and the laws of nature and my attempts to create the most efficient systematic process of working within those confines.

i don't tend to set goals for the sake of it, my goals exist in the specific actions within the process that i perceive to be the best means to some abstract unknowable end.  example:  it is not my goal to have x dollars in my retirement fund... it is my goal to put away x dollars every day/week/year so i eventually have some kind of functional retirement fund of unspecified amounts.

essentially, it is impossible for me to refrain from asking ""why am i doing this?"" and if an answer does not present itself i will assume what i am doing is skippable--some total waste of energy that ""goes through the motions"" in a predictable, but pointless way.  time management, for me, is a gambling game... i bet my time and energy on the occurrences i believe to be most likely.

organization for the sake of itself is pointless to me.  it exists as some sort of obstacle between me and the objects or information i desire to use.  organization is a rule that forbids gambling: it assumes that all objects or information have the potential to be equally useful in the future and thus categorizes and stores them equally neatly in order that they may be accessed equally easily.  but the act of categorizing and storing objects and information feels pointless when they may not prove useful or difficult to access in the future.

i wouldn't say i orchestrate situations where my behavior becomes automated very often, but i'll admit it's not something i've considered a great deal.  in social settings i imagine i do this more than in situations of enacted routine.  i'm sure it occurs in everyone at some point or another, but like organization, it seems to assume possible futures of equal likelihood and controls for one.  generally, i much prefer attempting to identify the most likely future and tailoring my behavior choices to it."

mikefullblack,WritingPrompts,1389635547.0,"“Zap him. He’s good. She can have two fish,” Lord stands in his newst facility with his trusted twelve staff members. Kissed with elaborate marble and smelling like fresh herbs, calling this base of operation upscale would not be enough.


“My Lord, Paul wants to go for a ride in some kinda car. What do we do?” One asks.

“Eh. I think it’s his time. Crash it,” Lord speaks with the deliberation of a hungry pedestrian ordering an extra cup of fries.

“Oh. Ok, Lord,” The assistant seems saddened, but follows through.

“Yeah. It’s too bad, huh?” towering over his disciple, Lord pats the kid on the back, “But we do what we must, not what we want.”

The round platform that the Lord stands on spans more distance than any single football field in the USA. The audience he is in charge of is greater than any concert that any musician could gather.

“Lord. Uh. What in the hell is that?” Disciple Judas (yes that one) asks. He points to his own screen that seems to display a style of radar.

“Phrasing, guy. Phrasing. I’ll check it out. It’s probably Allah or something. He probably got lost again. Such a nice guy, just needs an OPS.” Lord says.

“OPS?” Judas asks while removing his headset.

“The guidance system. Overworld Positioning Satellite,” Lord says.

Bartholomew calls, “Positioning System!” 

“Yes. Thank you,” Lord blushes a bit at his gaffe. Leaping out of the ceiling-less building. He lands without a sound on a vast and dry mountain.

“Holy Jesus on a stick! You’re God, right?” A stick figure of similar height to the Lord says. With a thick black outline forming his stick body, this stick figure is nearly two dimensional. God looks him over with a slow nod.

“Very funny. Who are you?” God asks.

“Flitzlerrand. I do what you do. I’m a ‘god’,” Flitz replies.

“Sexy. So what do you call people?” Lord asks.

“People,” Flitz replies.

“Apples?” Lord asks.

“Apples,” Flitz replies.

“How about pizza?” Lord asks.

“Are you hungry?” Flitz counters.

“Are you a cannibal?” Lord says. They both share a hearty laugh.

“So wow. We came up with the same ideas at about the same time?” Flitz says. A few trees begin to grow at his blocky feet.

“Oh. You’re…umm…Creating on my hill here,” Lord mutters while pointing with a stiff expression.

“Ooops. Sorry, brochetta,” Flitz chants and destroys the trees.

“What the Italy is a brochetta?” Lord asks.

“Ha. Italy. I guess there are some differences. Well, were some differences: my world just destroyed itself again, so I’m gonna be off for a while. Wanna grab some mead?” Flitz the stick figure points backwards.

“Strangely specific, but I really should be getting back to my own place,” Lord says. He turns and points over to his control center. As he does, all of the color drains from his face. He arm swings to his side as he shoulders roll towards the desiccated ground.

“As you already realize, your world is long gone,” As Flitz’s words reach the Lord’s ears, Lord sighs deeply.

“At least my schedule just opened up. Mead you say?” Lord says.

“Yeah that’s all I have left in my icebox.""

“So that’s what you call a fridge?” Lord asks.
 
“Whatever. You know, it’s too bad that when worlds collide: everything ends,” Flitz mumbles.

“Yes. I know. Ugh. I haven’t made this many mistakes in one day since that whole ‘birth of Nick Sabin’ thing,” Lord groans.

“Are you kidding? I love that guy!” Flitz bellows. The two walk towards a small house in the middle of the dry earth.

“That’s your home?” the Lord interrogates as they saunter over boulders and dust.

“Yeah. Just a small flat,” Flitz declares with the pride of an Armenian.

“Dammit, “ the Lord says.

WithMyFaceInMyPalm,AskMen,1389635618.0,"Fear of being judged I believe is of little concern. I say that because every guy or almost every guy I know would have had as many partners as you in college had they the means to accomplish it. They would be hypocrites to judge.

I also think a guy's fear of being inferior to past partners is not that big of a concern. Most guys I know are mature enough to handle that and realize the experience is unique and they bring their own flavor and style to the table.

What I think by far the most common issue you will run into is guys with lower partner counts who fear being sexually inferior to YOU YOURSELF, not being inferior to your past partners. The evidence is staring them in the face every time they look at you - if they were equally desirable as you they would have had just as many partners. Conclusion: less sexually desirable than partner, jealous and insecure as a result. 

There are of course exceptions, but from my anecdotal experience of the guys I know, this is by far the most common issue.

For the record, out of 20 or so guys I know, only one or two racked up a partner count comparable to yours in college - and one of those two basically slept with anybody and had zero standards, I believe he is a sex addict of sorts. Most of the rest of the guys I know had 0, 1, or 2 partners in college."

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389635731.0,"&gt;But then I read it was for that but it leaned to help women the most. I have read the last two on several feminism subreddits. Which one is the correct? If none of those what is the correct definition?

Feminism seeks gender equality and is centralized around women's issues and the summation of issues concerning gender inequality.

But you can't fight for gender equality simply by giving equal focus to each gender and their issues. Part of solving a problem within society is deconstructing larger social issues. Feminists have found that by observing gender issues, women still are subject to much of the discrimination that exists as the foundation to patriarchy. In order to seek equality, these inequalities must be dissolved.

It does mean, however, that the feminist movement is not going to start focusing on men's issues primarily. While feminism does generally recognize and identify issues that affect men, feminism ties these issues to the results of patriarchy and has decided that, for the most part, that understanding should not detract attention from women's issues.

&gt;I think some things are silly because one feminist, or at least on a feminist subreddit, said all sex is rape against a woman. That seems crazy to me.

Okay, but it's not actually crazy at all. You may want to read more radical and ""sex-negative"" feminist texts to get a better understanding, but I assure you it is not a knee-jerk reaction. They have processed this claim thoroughly.

&gt;I have also seen women on women subreddits get all fussy because companies target women by selling them pink products. This also seems silly. Why is it that they react this way?

Because not all women like pink, some like other colors, and advertisers perpetuate gender stereotypes by consistently marketing pink products to women. The affect that advertising and marketing has on humans is profound.

&gt; When a man is targeted with a blue, green, or pink product feminists(I presume they are) don't seem to care. 

Feminists are focused on women's rights and issues. I am aware that there is a large and popular movement for men's issues currently and from what I've seen they are very vocal about these issues. There are also lots of men's advocates who also identify with feminism. While the movements are parallel, they do not overlap because of at least some controversy and a fear to dilute the movements' focuses.

Also, according to feminist theory, the gender of men is not being disadvantaged by their targeted advertising because the products marketed to them generally establish a sense of autonomy and usefulness while marketing toward women tends to focus on products that make women accessories to men (beauty products, etc). That specific colors are used for men is mostly trivial and by solving the disparity women face in advertising it is understood that advertising for men would become more diverse as well.

&gt;I have had proclaimed feminist friends call me repressed because I like to cook and clean and do things for my SO. I would prefer he work and take care of me. I do work now and see nothing wrong with it but I would rather throw house parties. Why is this wrong?

You may be repressed, actually, at least if you are unwilling to recognize your own gender's disadvantage in society. While there is nothing wrong with you preferring to act as support for your SO in the ways you described, perhaps your justifications for it are what your feminist friends are considering evidence of ""repression"".

Also, while I can't know what they said for sure, being repressed isn't ""wrong"" and I don't think they were trying to say it was. Repression is simply the state of reinforcing your own oppression, which cannot really be good for your sense of autonomy. It doesn't mean your behavior is morally wrong.

&gt;I have seen proclaimed feminists say they want to get rid of gender words because being called manly is a compliment and girly an insult. How are those compliments and insults?

The adjectives that describe the gender of men generally describe autonomy. The adjectives that describe women generally pin them as accessory to men. However, it is important to all humans to be autonomous... 

Also, ""manly"" vs ""girly""... Manly refers to a masculine adult, girly refers to a feminine child. Women are in many ways treated like children in our society. The parallel use of these words is evidence of such.

&gt;I like gender differences. I like being unique from males. But if a male likes dresses or high heels I think it's great. And I love wearing boots and what not from the men's section. I don't do it to feel manly it's just a thing.

These are things acceptable to most feminists.

&gt;Also someone has to have the responsibility of telling ignorant people. I'm willing to learn but how can I understand, like, and be for a cause if no one wants to explain.

That's why we have school :)

No one here in /r/askfeminists is responsible for telling you about feminism. Rather we are all *willing* to share what we know.

&gt;I just don't understand why you would put the most likely victim in certain situations.

I wouldn't put anyone in a place where they did not have autonomy to protect themselves. I would never force someone to do something against their will if they felt they would be endangered. If one accepts risks in order to do their jobs, so be it. However, no restrictions should be placed on an individual based on their gender. Period."

I wonder if you could ever get into a situation where you're better off forfeiting than playing.  For example maybe you want to lose because you like the resulting playoff seeding better, but you can't lose by too much or else the point-differential tiebreaker would come into effect.

The only time I ever saw anyone reading the text was when the various pastors would read a brief passage and then go on a rant for about 30 minutes about what he thought it meant. 

I remember the last straw for me was when I was about 13 or 14. I had started trying out a new church and by now I had pink hair and wore combat boots so the church goers weren't exactly friendly. Anyway, I was already dealing with the unmistakable feeling of the fellowship not wanting me there when I went to a youth group meeting. It was being run by the pastor who did an entire meeting about ""Do you think if you died you'd go to heaven?"" I mean he was asking children this. I was one of the oldest ones there. A lot of the kids there were in Jr. High and elementary. He kept saying ""If you aren't sure if you'd go to heaven come up to the front and give yourself to Jesus"". These kids that were like 9 and 10 years old were bawling and crawling up to the front to pray that they wouldn't burn in hell. It was one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen."

However, you are asking too much for the school to make an exception for your kid. They have guidelines, and rules, and if you think they will analyze an individual situation, you would be wrong. 

As a gifted student I also required help in reading and comprehension, in 2nd grade I think, mainly due to extreme stress my family was going through at the time.

s-mores,dontstarve,1389636456.0,"Kiting can be used to mean any sort of hit-and-run tactic, I guess. Not sure of the exact etymology. In Don't Starve it just means exploiting enemies' attack patterns. Every enemy in the game 'announces' their hit *(via sound, Deerclops/Treeguard drawing their fist back, Queen Spider screaming or lifting its forelegs)*. So you exploit the fact that *you have to be within striking distance when the hit lands to actually get hit and take damage and it will take a while for them to 'recharge' the hit.*

For instance with hounds you just run from them until they try to bite, go back and hit once or twice, then run again until they try to bite you again. No damage, dead hound. Or with koalefants, hit four times, run, should be just in time to see the attack animation, then hit four times again.

I have a more spontaneous sex drive than most girls I know, so I *do* get horny out of nowhere fairly often. But most of the time I have the typical female reactive sex drive (I'm just very reactive... Like, a guy I'm really into putting the moves on me can get me ramped up within seconds purely because I know what's happening). On days when I'm not ""in the mood"" aka taking longer to ramp up properly (like I'm sad, or asleep...) I still go for it as long as my partner is good at foreplay. My boyfriend is a fucking PRO at lengthy/attentive ""fore""play (cause really, it *is* sex to me). With the right patience and technique I can go from crying and upset to super horny in only a few minutes, ha ha.

My last ex was the opposite... 13-year-old style humping ""foreplay""... He relied very heavily on my relatively spontaneous sex drive and how desperate I was for sex (my sex drive was much higher than his). So back then I would sometimes reject sex because I wasn't spontaneously turned on (""in the mood"") enough to enjoy 30 seconds of poking and 3 minutes of masturbating while there's a penis in me.

JarlesV3,dogeservice,1389636556.0,"If I remember my O-Chem, the answer for Series 1 and 2 are both going to be the compounds with Nitrogen. If you remember that NH3 and it's congugate NH4+ are both ""stable"", you can see that the adjacent + charge on item 2 in Serie 1 can be transferred to N by creating a double bond between C and N.

Similarly, in Serie 2, N already has a + charge. Oxygen and Carbon do NOT like + charges, but Carbon is better with being positive than Oxygen is. This is because of the electronegativity of each element.

Now, I hope you noticed from the first serie, that a positive charge (or negative charge even) will be more stable if it has more things (atoms and bonds) to bounce between. With that in mind, we can look at Serie 3. 0 has 2 locations the positive charge can bounce between C4 (where it is now) and C2 (if we move the double bond from C2=C3 to C3 = C4). What about 1 and 2? Which of those has more locations for the positive charge to bounce between.

Take a moment and consider that the aromatic rings have those double bonds that are really spread out between all 6 carbons. (these are the resonance structures, kinda like what were were talking about with spreading the + charge). Now that we know the aromatic rings have resonance structures, where can that + charge move on structures 1 and 2? it might be helpful to write in the -H on the ring. Keep track of the positive charge, and whichever structure has more places for the positive charge to share (ie, the most resonance structures) will be the most stable compound.

Which one did you get? I got 1 for Serie 3."

clairebones,AskWomen,1389636839.0,"You can relate the things you love to things she is interested in, so there's part of the conversation that she can at least get involved in. It will be difficult because she doesn't know anything about the gaming/nerd stuff as you (it seems) so you need to talk about it in a way that allows her to respond instead of just listening for ages. Maybe find some good sites that are related to your interests but are done in a way she would enjoy reading. Or find a game you think she would like, based on her interests, and encourage her to start it with you as couples activity. 

Alternatively, why not try a 'hobby swap', where you find a game/hobby of yours that she would like, and she does so for you, and you each spend time trying out that thing (even say once a fortnight for a few months, depending on how much time you both have free). She might be more receptive this way because it;s more about *sharing* your interests together than one partner just forcing their interests on the other. If you don't enjoy the hobbies you've been given then you start again with a new set.

One important thing - right now, because she isn't that interested, you will need to be careful about how much you bring it up. If she feels like you're forcing it into every conversation or 'won't shut up about it' so to speak, that will likely just turn her off even more."

Ulthanon,AskReddit,1389636850.0,"I have to start by admitting that when OWS began, I was hitting that cool-aid with a *vengeance*. I'd come to hate the Tea Party, and I wanted a social movement to challenge them. I was a dyed-in-the-wool liberal who was sick to death of the spinelessness of typical Washington Democrats (as I saw it, anyway) and wanted a left-wing group to emerge that wasn't afraid of throwing punches. 

Because of this, I posted forever on their boards. When I could get off of work, I went to the rallies in DC. And I tried to spread my idea that the group needed a goal. It needed leaders. And it needed to participate in government.

But at every turn, I was told that ""OWS believes that the system of government is corrupetd to the point that participating in that system will only corrupt the actor; thus, OWS is not going to participate in any governmental action"". They were so concerned with not being like the government they ""hated"", they crafted a system that simply *didn't work*.

Have you ever seen an assembly of hundreds, trying to agree on an agenda or even *what to discuss that day*, stymied by *one guy* who's just there to be a dick? OWS' General Assembly needed 100% concensus from its participants to do anything. If *anyone* disagreed, they hit the brakes. So there's one problem- they had a critical weakness to trolls.

Secondly, they never had any spokesmen. Say what you will about the Tea Party, at least their message was *unified*. They might be fucking *madmen* through and through, but they *got shit done*. They sent people to Washington and those people had a demonstrable effect on the discourse. Occupy didn't have any leaders, so nobody could speak for the movement. There was no message, just background noise; you had some intelligent people with good plans, but you had a hundred times as many Econ101 freshmen jacking Ron Paul off without actually knowing what the hell they were saying. People *need* leaders to filter out the bullshit that inevitably occurs when masses gather- and OWS wasn't willing to do that.

In the end, I have to agree with the people who said that OWS ended up being ""Radical Chic"" for college kids. *Real* governmental change takes time. It takes compromise and debate and months of legal finagling. But who the hell has time for that? The cops got mean, the weather got cold, and *actually* taking the time to craft a valid electoral game plan doesn't get that cute hippie dude/chick into bed with you. 

TL;DR: Occupy had the moment and the momentum, but couldn't get past the excitement of marching around NYC/Washington long enough to actually solidify past that nascent cloud of ""We are the 99%""."

•Low-income women are more likely than men to regret tying the knot when they did — 52 percent versus 33 percent.

•And nearly one-third of low-income women with children wish they had postponed having children — or had fewer of them. 


It seems to me that Gillibrand's quote ""We have to do better,"" is absolutely right- if ""we"" is in regards to women in general. Women need to understand that their choices have consequences that will affect them for the rest of their lives and be prepared to make well-thought out choices rather than going on ""muh feels"" or by the spur of the moment.

Diguiseppimon,Ohio,1389636968.0,"Came here to say the same thing that /u/projectxmatt did. 
I went to Lifeskills back in 2005, after going to New Albany schools my entire life. It was a culture shock, to say the least. The one thing I did notice, and absolutely loved, was that the teachers there actually cared about their students, they cared whether you 'got' something or not, and if you didn't they had specialized labs set up for each area; math, science, etc. I was failing in high school in New Albany because we were top of the line, we had all the best teachers, all the best programs, and lots, and lots of money. However, teachers really didn't give a shit. I needed 13 credits to graduate from high school when I switched to Lifeskills. When I switched, I had a 1.1 GPA, and **three months** later, I had become the first kid to graduate from Lifeskills in record time. After straight A's, and a B or two, I graduated with a measly 2.2 GPA. But the good thing was, was they were all high school classes, it was not a GPD, it was a real, high school diploma. I liked the idea of a charter school because if I went there, it was up to me how much work I got done. I didn't have homework (which was one of my big downfalls in school, hated homework, and always aced tests, so my grades failed because of it), came in early, and stayed late if I needed to. I watched all the ghetto kids dick around all day, while I actually got my shit done. I had other friends that went to the Graham school, which was another charter school, and their classes sounded like absolute BS with no academic merits at all. The only thing that both schools had in common, which most 'normal' schools did not, was give you courses and get you started in the 'real world'. Even one of the math courses was called 'real world math', which helped you learn about taxes, how to balance check books, calculate mortgages, and all that fun stuff. They had work areas to help you make up resumes, put you into volunteer work, or internships that would later lead to an actual job. They were great, *if you had the drive to better yourself*. However, I saw a lot of kids who were in their early 20's who still didn't get their shit together, because they were really into gangs and stuff. 

The teachers that work in charter schools deserve more credit than they will ever be given. They deal with really difficult kids, usually in really bad areas of town, and give them their all. They truly want to see them do better in life, and take way less pay to spend way more time making sure that they get the best education they can. "

And $6.45 million is a lot to give to someone who's 31 and already has competent replacements on the team (in the form of Hunter, James, and Lattimore).  They may not cut him outright, but I fully expect them to at least ask if he's willing to take a pay cut.  If he'll take, say, $2.5 or $3 million instead, it gets a lot easier to make things work.  If not... I don't know.  Not saying he'd definitely be gone, but I wouldn't underestimate the possibility.  Even Jerry Rice didn't get to finish his career in SF.

Ultimately, it all comes down to dollars and years.  I think in an ideal world we'd let Gore finish his career here and re-sign both Boldin *and* Whitner.

3. Many guys get nervous the first few times they have sex and suffer ED. This is no one's fault and no partner should laugh about. It happens, try again later. This can happen to the woman too, leaving her dry. Lube is your friend. 
4. Partners should communicate. Say what you want, mean what you say.

koranen (ordagrant översatt till: recitationen) är en diktamen av vad gud sa genom mohammed och allt som står i koranen är guds ord

One other thing I use it for is telling me if I have email. I've got a simple python script that runs every minute and will light up some LEDs connected to the parallel port depending on what account has messages.

I've also had it set up to deal with my printer, but I need to buy a new one so at the moment it's not doing that.

One of the really big things I use it for is a bridge between my old and modern computers. I'm really into retro computing and I've used it to write floppies and in the case of my old computers with network cards, Telnet, FTP and a few other things.

Also, being a Pentium 4 it doubles as a space heater on these cold winter days :P

Also, there is no worry that she will prematurely ejaculate and go soft on me. When she has an orgasm, the next one is right around the corner.

hopewings,infj,1389637304.0,"Paralysis by over-analysis.

One line stood out to me:
&gt;I never initiate physical intimacy.

As an INFJ female, I always loved it when the guy initiates.  Anything.  My husband was the one who talked to me privately first, and he piqued my interest.  After that, I did a lot of escalation and initiation of my own, but if he hadn't done some of that confident manly sexy initiation himself, I would not have gotten nearly as interested.

It just occurred to me that you're over a decade younger than me!  Oh I'm getting old.  It's like I'm practicing giving advice to my son (who is just one and half right now, but I'm sure he'll be agonizing over some girl or other sooner or later).  

So, another one-liner:

&gt;I really want to ask A out. I really want to move forward. But I don't know how.

Solution is easy.  Move forward and ask her out.  If I were my husband, I'd say something like ""man up and just do it.""  But coming from a female that might sound bad.  So I'll say ""if you don't do it, you'll never get a yes, and even if she does shoot you down, at least you'll have certainty.""  

By the way, we INFJs are extremely perceptive.  If she's getting warmer and more physical, she probably already knows you're interested in her romantically and is giving you encouragement.  Instead of acting on that, you're asking a bunch of random strangers online for advice.  What are you waiting for?  Just go for it!  Kiss the girl!  "

Depends on what you're looking for. 

Check the [NPC contest schedule/website](http://contests.npcnewsonline.com/contests/npc.php) (this is the 2013 schedule though) or [NaturalBodybuildingEvents.com](http://naturalbodybuildingevents.com/) for tested shows. 

As for tips:

* A diet coach is not necessary but would be extremely beneficial. Much easier than trying to figure out stuff such as peak weak protocols, etc. 

* Practice your posing!! No matter how 'fit' you think you are, you're never fit enough to pose. It's a workout unto itself. 

* When on stage, SMILE!! No one wants to see a grimace. Looks like you're crapping your pants. Make it look like you've been there before. 

* Expect to lose more weight than you thought you had. It's astounding how you grossly underestimate how fat you are, and how much you can lose during a contest prep. 

* Have fun. If it's not fun, you're not going to be doing it long. 

Good luck!

Our rabbit is very social and will come out to say hi in a few minutes after people come in.  He might tug on their pants and we let guests know that's it's ok to gentle nudge him away from the behavior.  They like to try to get a pet in on him, but he's more of a ""I'm here to sniff you and now I'm gone!  Hey look I am back again!"" sort of bunny.

Some people want to hold him, but he doesn't like it and can bite your shoulder or neck after a short time.  We are honest with people and let them know this.  If they want, my husband and I will hold him (he tolerates it with us and we can tell if he's about to bite and need t be put down) and we will have the guest pet him while he is in our arms.

brotherbock,AskReddit,1389637413.0,"I was in grad school and TA'd at a D1 University. By TAing, I mean that we were planning and teaching and grading, with almost no oversight by the professors at all. We functionally were the professors for the courses.

We never heard about anyone getting strongarmed, although somehow several big name players would somehow manage to fail required courses in our department and keep playing...which shouldn't have been allowed (the keep playing part).

My most interesting moment was a course I was teaching which included two Basketball players, one man and one woman. The womens' player was always in class, studied hard, came to office hours with questions, and was a solid B to B+ performer (and the star of the team that year). The men's player was an up and coming player, frequently absent, and was aiming for a solid C- or D+.

Then they took the final. I was grading her exam, and I noticed a mistake in one problem. It was a logic course, and she put a 'p' where she should have written a 'q' on one line. Other than that, the proof was correct, just a transcription error from one line to the next. Take off a few points for that one, grade the rest of her exam, move on. The next exam is the male player's. I notice partway into the exam that he made the very same mistake on the very same proof. Huh. I start looking closer.

His proofs looked exactly like hers--except for the proof after that transcription error proof--there, his proof looked exactly like hers, except it was missing a line. His proof was nonsense without that line, but looked otherwise just like hers. He copied off her test.

My problem was that I had no proof of who copied and/or allowed to copy from who. I mean, I *knew* what happened, but I needed hard evidence. So on the department's advice I sent them both letters, saying there was a problem with their exam and I needed to meet with them.

I get a call from the men's player. 

Him: ""Uh, what's the problem?""

Me: ""I don't want to talk about it over the phone, let's meet in my office.""

Him: ""I'm at a camp with the team, the coach is right here. Can't we talk about it over the phone.""

Me: ""I'd rather not.""

Him: ""If it's about cheating, I didn't cheat.""

Me: ""It *is* about cheating, and we need to meet, next week.""

Him: ""Okay.""

Then later, that *same afternoon*, the women's player called.

Her: ""What's the problem?""

Me: ""I'd rather talk in person."" (I had scheduled to talk to both of them back to back, so they'd see each other there)

Her: ""I'm at a camp with the team, it's hard to get away.""

Me: ""Okay...there's an issue with cheating on yours and (name's) tests that we need to get straight. His exam was identical to yours.""

Her: (upset) ""Brotherbock, you *know* I didn't cheat. I worked my butt off for that grade, you know that!""

Me: ""I *know*, but there needs to be evidence and an investigation.""

Her: ""If he copied from me, I had *no* idea. What happens if no one confesses?""

Me: ""I will have to make a new test that you'll both have to take.""

Her: ""I already worked my ass off for the first one!""

Me: (sigh) ""I know.""

Her: (pause) ""If he calls you and admits that he cheated off me and I wasn't involved, will I have to take a new test?""

Me: ""Nope.""

Her: ""Okay."" (hangs up)

*Minutes* later...men's player calls me again.

Him: ""Uhhhhh...I copied off (name). She didn't have anything to do with it."""

**You should not trust this woman.**

&gt;  I would still have to deal with her for the rest of my life as she's the mother of my kids.

Absolutely.  But you wouldn't be living a cuckold lie.  She could go fuck whoever she wants to, and you could be free of the lying, cheating, no morals having bag of shit you used to be married to.

Plenty of divorced parents are fantastic parents.

&gt; she would beg forgiveness which would be hard not to give

Hey man, as you can see, there aren't even words for how stupid I think you would be for staying married to this woman.  But it's your life and your choice.

This is the part that is completely cut and dry - YOU get to make the decision.

This man needs to be told immediately so that he can make the decision for himself.

You seem concerned about the potential damage to the children a divorce would cause.  How about the damage to everyone when, 10 or 15 years from now (or even sooner), the secret gets out and the child probably kills himself over it?

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1389637643.0,"We don't know that Iluvatar ever punishes anyone but the Numenorean army that attempts to invade Valinor. He doesn't even punish Melkor during the Music for explicit, willful rebellion -- he just rebukes him. So presuming that he's punishing orcs is a bit of a stretch.

&gt; I prefer the twisted elves theory because it explains (in part at least) why there would be huge wars and then long periods of peace. Both sides were slow breeders. But if orcs were just twisted humans or created from whatever why didn't Morgoth or Suaron just Zerg rush the elves or Numenors?

Well, they were significantly weaker than the Elves and Numenoreans, generally. Orcs are cannon-fodder for an average Elf.

As for the long periods of peace... when were those, exactly? Even during the Siege of Angband, there were frequent raids on Elven holdings from groups escaping behind the Siege's lines. And the eras between massive wars in the Second and Third Ages are what allows Sauron to overrun Men and Elves alike with the sheer number of orcs -- because they've been rapidly multiplying during that time. Finally, what leads you to say that ""both sides were slow breeders""? Look at Feanor and his seven sons. Elrond only had three, but he was limited by his wife's capture and leaving for the West. Even then, we have no idea how quickly the Elves actually bred, as we rarely have birthdates for them, and gestational periods are undefined, *and* the books only focus on nobility, not your average Moriquendi's life.

The simple fact is, if we're stepping OOC for a second, Tolkien himself repudiated the Elven origin, so it is not canon. You can prefer it (I think a lot of the later changes Tolkien was envisioning would've been for the worse) but that doesn't change the fact that orcs don't come from elves."

ChileanIggy,leagueoflegends,1389637741.0,"Well... if two adc's are building similarly... doesn't it really come down to the skill of the lane?

There's enough variety, I feel, to be experimental, and to respond to the shifts in the game, depending on which lane pulls ahead etc etc.

Whenever this comes up, I see the words, but all I read is ""I'm not good enough to rely on my champion and need items to break out of my current skill cap""

I agree that some things need a little tweaking, as they ever have (and ever will), but I like the way the game has evolved, and have really enjoyed the support changes. It's really easy for green players to get into the role and have a better experience than simply being a ward dispenser, and it added a lot of depth to veteran supports.

I've also seen some complaints about the rate at which new content is added (namely champions), and it just makes me chuckle. I remember when they'd come out every two weeks, more or less, and though it was nice, holy shit was it irritating. I know everyone bitches about glitches and instability issues but back then it was a guarantee that something awful would happen server-wise every two weeks. Not to mention the rate at which champions were released made it difficult to keep up to what some of them could do to the meta, at least for players like me who can't invest the time and money necessary to keep up. Having a life gets in the way, don't you know."

* Do you believe the fed slowing down the level of quantitive easing in the bond markets will eventually lead to no further QE, or do you believe that since these measures were taken there will just be repeated in the future.

* Do you believe the volker rule goes far enough or is it too flawed, or is it simply something to push out the door to get further expanded upon/watered down?

* How will the corresponding EU regulations impact the American financial sector?

1. Get hair all the way wet, which takes longer than you'd think.

2. Shampoo hair and rinse.

3. Use face scrub to exfoliate.

4. Apply copious amounts of conditioner to tips of hair.

5. Lather up a wash rag and wipe down my exterior ladybits.

6. Lather up a loofah and clean the rest of me.

7. Rinse all that conditioner out of my hair.

8. Check for leftover soap suds in hair or any nooks and crannies.

This isn't even counting the ordeal of shaving armpits (adds about 3 minutes), legs (adds about 20 minutes), or nether regions (adds about 20 minutes because you have to go slowly).

In contrast, my boyfriend jumps into the shower and his hair is already wet by the time he's got his shampoo/conditioner combo in his hands. He washes his hair, runs a soapy rag over everything, rinses, and is done."

i agree with /u/MoreBroThanYo that you guys aren't really dating unless you plan to get to a place where you actually are in the same place at the same time more often than every few months.

long-distance relationships can work out, but they will never be a substitute for a real, spend time together in the real-world relationship.

as for the triad, if all parties are open and in agreement, poly relationships can work, but it doesn't sound like any of you are ""open"" and communicative, especially if Anthony didn't say anything to Matt until December.

so my advice, given the information, is to stop thinking of either of them as being your ""boyfriend"" or that you are ""dating"" unless and until you are willing to begin making plans for your future. they are nice men and certainly friends, but until then, get off your computer and meet some guys closer to you. best of luck."

That said, the distinctive thing about Capitalism is that the means of production is owned by a small minority. This allows capital accumulation that can be invested in the constant revolutionizing of production that is a fundamental aspect of Capitalism.

 In the Middle Ages a craftsman or artisan personally owned all the tools needed to do his job. In the countryside, most peasants did not own their land outright, but still had customary rights to plots of land they passed down to their children, and they made their own farm equipment and owned their own oxen to pull the plows.

This changed in the Early Modern period. In the countryside farmland was ""enclosed"" and peasants were formally had rights to a plot of land by tradition and custom were evicted and made into landless laborers. This consolidated the means of production into the hands of landowners, the peasants became hired farm laborers. This allowed the landowners to intensively grow cash crops, or raise sheep for wool, rather than merely extracting rents and customary labor from tenants.

At the same time, wool merchants started centralizing production of wool in primitive factories rather than contracting out to individual peasant families, this allowed them to monopolize the means of production.

Essentially, early Capitalism broke the traditional barriers (feudal land tenure and urban guilds) to centralizing and monopolizing the means of production by wealthy merchants."

Here is the thing about Boba Fett . . . .

His bad-assery in ESB and RotJ are based upon not just what is seen in the movies but what can be inferred, i.e., the necessary backstory that happens off-screen for the few actions seen in the films to be possible. 

In ESB, Boba Fett reaches Bespin before the rebels. The Slave 1 is fast, for sure, but Boba also knows where to go. Think about what cognitive skills and the intelligence network necessary to make this happen. Fett is fast, smart, a quick thinker and decision maker, and has an incredible intelligence network.

More importantly, he reaches Bespin first and then still has enough time to make a deal with Darth Vader somewhere along the way. Let me emphasize this again. Boba Fett has the cajones to approach Darth Vader - a figure who terrifies his own Imperial Officers - and cut a deal. Boba goes to Darth Vader and says, ""O hai I want something from you."" He not only has the balls to do this but apparently the reputation to even get an audience with Lord Vader as well. Also, Fett's negotiation skills must be nothing short of amazing if after approaching Vader, and being granted an audience with him, he is able to successfully convince Vader to just hand Han over to him. This is nothing short of amazing.

Then comes the famous, ""he's no good to me dead"" line. We learn here that not only is Boba only in this for the money but he must have even bigger cajones to openly question Vader's actions and only get the crisp response from Vader that he will be compensated by the Empire for his loss. The last guy to openly question Vader got the Dark Side Death Grip to the neck. Fett must have done something at some time to earn Vader's respect. That's impressive.

Next there is RotJ. Boba is walking around Jabba's Palace in his full Mandalorian armor, including helmet and jet pack. While others are relaxing, dude is still wearing full armor including a jetpack he couldn't possibly use in such a confined space. The dude never goes off duty. Badass. While walking around in full armor and helmet, he is still a hit with the ladies. Dude has swagger and mad lady-killer skills. You have to give him props.

Then Leia walks in with Chewie and dressed in Boushh's armor. Leia negotiates the bounty with a thermonuclear device that gets almost everyone in a panic. Notice how fast Fett springs to action. He's in a room of the galaxy's most vile villainy and scum and he is the least panicky and fastest to his weapon. Badass. Then after that is over, he gives Leia/Boushh a respectful nod. I love that frikken nod! That nod says, ""you threaten to blow everyone up including yourself just for a few extra credits. Respect."" I would be terrified of someone who negotiates with an explosive device. Fett just had mad respect. Badass.

That nod also says, ""You brought in Chewie, a bounty I was not able to negotiate from Vader."" Presumably Fett asked for Chewie back in ESB; if there were credits to be had, Fett wold have wanted them. He apparently dropped that part of the negotiations in order to secure the more lucrative Han bounty. Fett knows how to negotiate and is smart enough to cut his losses in the aim for a bigger payday. Badass.

Finally, it was necessary for Fett to be temporarily disposed for the rest of the movie to continue. If the Rebels had escaped without taking care of Fett, he would have pursued them and then the whole plot would have changed and we'd never have the big Rebel victory at the end. 

TL;DR - We know Boba Fett is the most awesome bounty hunter in the universe because of what we can learn from ESB and RotJ via context.

myrrlyn,modclub,1389638343.0,"FWIW, reddit's ban algorithm is at times guilty of some seriously weird behavior. reddit has a very laissez-faire attitude towards subreddits, and as long as nothing blatantly illegal goes on, they don't mind if it's an ordinarily taboo topic. reddit has TONS of NSFW subreddits. The only thing the admins have done in that regard is to enable NSFW switches so that people who don't want to see it won't, and people who do, will. Hell, /r/randnsfw is a **site feature**.

It is very common practice to put links to external sites in the sidebar. So long as you personally do not receive compensation for traffic, reddit doesn't care.

If your sub is banned and you believe that the action was wrongful, submit a link to your subreddit at /r/redditrequest. The admins are generally pretty good about unbanning or explaining why the ban was enforced.

The only experience I have with this personally is a subreddit I created was autobanned immediately; apparently the name was similar enough to a legitimate ban that the script fired. I asked nicely and they lifted it.

There's no need to be worried about NSFW content. Just make sure it's legal and you'll be fine."
JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389638344.0,"Ok, I know I kinda blew up over this topic in another discussion, so sorry for that, but I'd  say YES.

Here's the thing. UBI isn't enough to really make sure people live comfortably, and while it will help reduce potential exploitation, ti won't eliminate it, because to make any money above UBI, you need a job, and if you get a job, you should be properly paid for it.

I live in a poor city where many people are on welfare as it is, and the job market is horrible. I've been looking for over a year now, and the only opportunities are these low wage jobs that exploit the crap out of people. If these guys could afford to get away with paying less, you bet they would.

Here's the thing, people assume that transactions between employers and employees in terms of pay and work conditions are voluntary, but they're largely not. They're ultimatums, and while UBi might make them a little more voluntary, if you want REAL social mobility and not an underclass, you'd be for minimum wage. 

If you get rid of the minimum wage, people on UBI would lose their only means to ""get ahead""....to get more money you need a job, and if you need a job, you'll accept whatever your employer deems you to be worth. If you make $15k on UBI and $17k on UBI + wages, while some people might see that as worth it, it's freaking highway robbery if you ask me. There's just too much exploitation that can happen here. And since I expect minimum wage workers to help foot the bill through the same high taxes the rich people will pay (it's my way of clawing back the benefits), reducing the wage, if corporate loopholes and the like aren't dealt with, will just make UBI less sutainable as the government will draw in less revenue.

If UBI does drive up wages, then that's still no excuse to get rid of the minimum wage, it just makes it a statutory minimum that no one needs.

UBI also affects the whole wage pricing structure. If minimum wage goes down, there will be less incentive for employers to hire people at higher wages....they can just move the entire structure down a  notch. Make $25 an hour? Well, you'll accept $15 or find yourself out of the job, you got UBI after all. And then the jobs that were $15 an hour might only be $10, and the jobs that were $10 could now be $5. It just has the potential to unravel the whole wage structure.

So the middle class gets pinched, and this makes UBI look like a horrible policy. It will be considered job killing for the middle class, and people will then complain about taxation. 

That being said, I think it is VERY irresponsible to get rid of minimum wage. Some people think it will increase the work available, which it might, but it might also depress the whole wage structure in America, which can't afford to be depressed because UBI leads to much higher tax rates in wage income. People argue that it is a good compromise with the right, but looking at their response to the compromise that was obamacare, as well as the mess that IS obamacare, I say it's not worth it. They'll turn in it any way for political points, and then we're left with a bad bill that hurts people rather than helps them, which will then serve as a rallying cry to their cause. And who knows, if the other side is charismatic enough, like it was with Ronald Reagan, this could adversely affect policy and the goals we are trying to reach with UBI for DECADES. Remember, in the 60s Johnson had the war on poverty, and this served as a rallying cry against ""welfare queens"" everywhere during the 80s...here we are 30 years later and look at how the discourse on this subject has suffered.

At the VERY least, we should  treat minimum wage and UBI as two separate issues. We should implement UBI, give it a few years, and then have a discussion about the minimum wage. We shouldn't implement one just to take away the other. It's irresponsible. UBI is sweepign change  as it is, let's not make it more radical because this could lead to even worse circumstances. I don't really see a good argument other than a libertarian/ideological one for this proposed change in the first place. With UHC and UBI, corporations, while taxed higher, would no longer have to pay for health insurance or payroll taxes anyway, all those taxes would now be on the employee to pay their fair share.

But yeah, I think it would be irresponsible to make a knee jerk decision in eliminating the wage. I think it should be treated as a separate issue, and only evaluated after several years of UBI being implemented. Otherwise, there's just too much that could possibly go wrong with repealing it, and that decision could hurt millions of people, and hurt our cause. "

You do not want a car around that is titled to a dead person; it's against the law and will generate a massive headache if you drive the car or sell it.

You might want to reconsider keeping the car.  While it's nice to have an awesome old car around, there are issues.  It will decrease in value if you just let it sit.  It needs to be driven every so often; hoses, belts, plugs, plug wires, etc need to be replaced and ideally replaced with period replicas, which are costly; it needs to be kept clean inside and out, which is actually a specialty profession of its own called 'detailing'; or it will get grungy and lose value or require replacement of cosmetically damaged parts.  You can't let just any shade-tree mechanic work on a '57 Vette; many will strip off the valuable OEM parts and replace them with Lord knows what.

In other words, keeping an old car in the shape to be valuable is a job, takes time and skill.  You should really consider whether you want to devote time and cash to it.

Thats why Morgan Freemans video up there is so powerful, as a black man he feels it falls short, he is clearly passionate about his own history, and how the nation sees his race and its history in america.

That is why it has power. A non-blacks opinion on the validity of BHM's continued existence is inherently less powerful or convincing, thats why /u/MIUfish referenced Freemans opinion and not some non-black figure of reputes opinion.

""Walk a mile in his moccasins"" as the phrase goes, which would earn your opinion more repute in my eyes. I argue that it is absolutely relevant.

So i looked up your comments to look for clues as to whether you were black. I see you're an ex-mormon, and mormon ethnic demographics have a very low number of black people (USA [0.4%](http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Vital_Statistics)).

I found the nuance and consideration in your position lacking, and you claiming Black History Month is ""ridiculous"" just entrenches you further in that light to me, and further discredits the repute of your argument. 

Any point you may have, needs to be pushed forwards within a *better* idea, not in mockery and rejection, that only betrays a dislike for the symbolic reparations of BHM and indifference to the oppression in black american history.

Czechmate_,AskReddit,1389638507.0,"Sophomore year:

My lunch table was on the more awkward end of the social spectrum, we were all the kids who didn't fit in any where else. That means that we were the smart stoners, the apathetic hostile kids, and the painfully socially awkward. One day at lunch a girl at our table busts out a condom, not too unusual. Sitting next to her is a kid who is just about to devour his just purchased corn dog and she takes it from him, puts the condom on it, which is funny enough, and HURLS it across the cafeteria. This dog gets long hand time and lands with a thunderous flop in the middle of the skateboard kids table. The ""What the fucks?!"" echoed through the cafeteria prompted by my table trying to maintain composure while they go around the cafeteria asking who made the contraceptive corn dog an indirect projectile, clearly, thinking it as a trespass on their masculinity and wanting to say some fighting words.

We did a lot of stuff like that.

Honestly, the best solution for us might be to get Rogers to take a pay cut rather than cutting him outright.

DeathB4DNF,jobs,1389638852.0,"Warning: long rant.

You're young and you're employed. Which is contrary to what you hear here or in the news; you're used to hearing people unable to get jobs or be underemployed.

Some would ask what you're truly passionate about and make that your job. It's a valid argument and there are stories of others that turn their passion into jobs and success. Some would argue find a job you are content with and earns you a good salary and something that you can raise you head up and say ""I earned an honest day's wage."" Another group would say just be happy with any job. If your best friend said the same things to you, what would tell them? 

I think we've all been conditioned to believe that we will all have great jobs doing things we love and making a contribution to the world, once we graduate from college. While some will, the vast majority of us will be cogs in a larger machine. What we hope for is to leave something that we can at least be proud of and not reflect on things that could have been ""if only."" 

What held me back and still holds me back to some extent is comfort. We become comfortable with what we have and comfortable with possesions that we are expected to own. I've always wanted to backpack around the world and bike across the USA, by myself. I told my family my plans, their stipulation was that I at least have a friend go with me. You realize how difficult it is to convince someone to take 6 months to a year off of work and possibly spend anywhere between $5,000 to $20,000 for traveling, be it biking or backpacking across the world. I'm not much older than you, but I'm now burdened with bills and job that I cannot just drip anymore. Can I still take trips, yes, it wouldn't be the same, I'm now constrained by vacation days and time tables.

I tore myself up, I read existentialist works and tried to make sense of what I wanted to do. I was wary of taking on more debt for school, to which I was only half sure about, I couldn't get accepted to schools and programs I wanted, so I basically just floated around in a weird state. I saw friends moving in life with success and joy, I grew bitter and angry, I wanted it also; but I also had no idea what I wanted.

If I could do it again, I would've enlisted in the military out of HS, so I could grow up and make mistakes without the safety and security of being near family, friends, and the familiarity of what I know. That's in the past now, what worked for me, was realizing I was always looking for a way out. I did well, but I never put my whole heart in it, I hated my job and to some extent I still do. What changed for me was not the work, but my perception of it, I focused on the people I work with and not the job or the task. Will it work in the long run, I don't know, it's worked for me so far, I'll reassess when I get to that point.

Like you, I want to do something else, I've set myself up to at least get fully vested in my company before I decide what to do next, it will most likely be nursing. In the interim, I'm going to bolster what I can, I'm going to get work to pay for an MBA. That's my plan at least.

Mike Rowe's TED Talk about jobs is excellent in getting you to think about your perceptions of work and jobs. 

Exercise and hobbies are important to keep yourself from always over thinking about your predicament. I always got hung up on so many things, if I changed something or did something else, how things would be different. Making decisions is also taking risks. You look at what the possible outcomes are and can you recover from a negative outcome and can you live with it? 

The biggest thing is the fear of failure.  Your construct of failure, will family see you as a failure, will friends see you as a failure, will future employers see yourself as failure, will future romantic interests see failure, or will you see yourself as a failure?

My sports psych professor gave an example (this is over 5 years ago so I maybe a little fuzzy on the exact details, my apologies): given a choice to toss a ball into three rings, ring A having a 100% success rate, ring B having a 70% success rate, and ring C having a 30% success rate,  most people will choose ring B. She asked us why? She told us that it is hard enough without being too easy. It doesn't demoralize a person for being too easy or too hard. Giving a 50/50 chance, felt too much like luck and people like to have a sense of control. 

This ties in with our perception of failure, we want to succeed. We are all now afraid of failing. 

Sorry, this turned into an unorganized stream of consciousness. Take some of the weight off this decision, is it a big decision, but don't let the gravity of a decision impair your ability to decide. The whole paralysis by analysis is painfully frustrating. 

TL; DR - failure, fear, security, and perceptions hold us back or move us forward. "

**Quebec, Canada:**

*Expectations:* For everyone to hate on the English speaking dude and general French arrogance.

**Georgia, US:**

*Expectations:* Racist hicks.

*Reality:* People that were beyond sweet and inviting to me as I travelled. A genuine interest in both my home of Canada and my cultural background. I also ended up falling in love with the lovely Southern accent.

**Florida, US:**

*Expectations:* Laid back, folks who were used to Cubans and other minorities.

*Reality:* So much racism. Everyday I was there I had some comment about my ethnicity. My friends and I almost got into a few fist fights because of it as well.

**Mexico:**

*Expectations:* Cheap, relaxing, beach vacations with honest people.

*Reality:* Expensive, relaxing, garbage strewn beach vacation with people trying to rob us.

**Portugal &amp; Spain:**

second, assuming that it's not medical, how do you feel about being the top? have you been the top in other relationships? you say that you are ""new to the game"" - have you done anal play before your bf? not all men enjoy anal play, and it's possible that it's something that you are not into as much as he is. or it may be something that you need more preparation before entering him.

finally, ""we just had a huge fight about it yesterday"" - what?! because you have difficulty topping him, you have a fight? and you want to continue? i'm sorry, but if my bf got mad because i couldn't stay hard, i'd tell him that he could take that attitude and stick it up his ass and see if that made him feel any better. his pressuring you is not going to help you stay hard.

i could be reading more into this than really is there, but it sounds like he doesn't care whether you want to have anal sex or can perform, only that he gets your cock in his ass. if that's the case, i'd say dump his selfish ass.

If you spend some time studying yourself you will find that you too have a very fundamental (animalistic) coping mechanism, be it talking, writing, music, praying, going out, exercising, shopping etc. Everyone has one. If you believe religion is a coping mechanism then why not accept that it is just a way that someone justifies how something bad or good that happens in their life? 

We teach our children to find comfort in 'special blankets' and 'teddy bears' or 'sucking thumbs' so is it so farfetched to think that people try to come up with a reason why the universe (or anything that we can't explain) is the way it is?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a religions person by any means but I respect these religions and the fundemantal messages they 'try' to preach...

puppydog_smiles,TwoXChromosomes,1389639177.0,"I tell everyone about [RealSelf](http://www.realself.com/breast-augmentation) because it really is a great resource.  This link is to the breast augmentation review, but since you breastfed two kids, I'm going to assume you have lost volume **and** have some sagging issues.  In this case, implants will not help the sagging - you would likely need a lift (mastopexy) with implants.  I say this because my best friend had and breastfed three beautiful girls and is actually scheduled for surgery the first week in February.  Needless to say, we have been scouring the internet researching and learning.  She has actually decided to do a tummy tuck and lipo first, and then go back for the breast lift and augmentation.  Her consultations, however, were for all of it.  All three surgeons said that implants would just make her saggy boobs bigger, and that they could do a lift, but after the lift, she would barely have enough breast tissue to fill an A cup (pre-kids she was a D!).

First, I would recommend having multiple consultations.  She had three, and one surgeon stood out from the rest both with before &amp; after pictures and with his manner - he made her feel more comfortable and more confident in his abilities.  This is really important!  You will also want to make sure that they are board-certified, that they use a board-certified anesthesiologist, and that they use an accredited surgical facility or hospital.  These things seem like no-brainers, but you would be surprised at how many people overlook this stuff.  I would also make sure that you have the price breakdown because there are usually additional fees for the anesthesiologist and the surgical facility.

The [ASPS website](http://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/breast-augmentation.html) also has some great basic information about the different procedures, complete with animated videos explaining incision and implant placement and such.  You won't find any reviews or experiences here, but I thought the videos were really helpful for understanding the different options (breast lift incisions are usually different from breast augmentation incisions).

When you narrow your search to surgeons, they should have before and after pictures on their website that explain which options were used on each patient.  That can help you to see what the actual outcomes for the different option combinations could look like.  For example, [this woman](http://www.nycosmeticmd.com/photo-gallery/details.cfm?ID=44&amp;StartRow=6) had a short-scar mastopexy-augmentation with 325cc silicone gel implants placed in a submuscular position.  I guess this last part is just to reinforce the importance of research.  Make sure the surgeons you choose for consultations produce results you're hoping to achieve, and that they don't have any dings on their medical records.  Medical licenses are issued through the state, so you'll have to check with your state medical board for that information.  You can also check medical review websites like [Vitals](http://www.vitals.com/), [HealthGrades](http://www.healthgrades.com/), and [RateMDs](http://www.ratemds.com/) for reviews, as well as the usual Yelp, Yahoo and Google.

Lastly, I would make sure you have help after surgery, especially since you have kids.  You won't be able to lift anything for at least a couple of weeks, which can make day-to-day activities difficult.  My friend's youngest is 6, and she waited because she thought it would be too much for her husband to deal with the kids post-op when they were little.  I hope this helps!"

**Explanation of problem**

Simply put, for your internet to work, you need the IP address of the server that has the website. To get said IP addresses, your computer uses a so-called ""DNS"" (domain-name service) server. What *seems* (read: not confirmed) to have happened is that somebody crashed the DNS servers of the AT&amp;T network and therefore people lost connectivity for a while.

----

**But if they're down and I'm on AT&amp;T, how did I get here?**

The thing is, to improve connection speed your browser automatically saves your common websites into a so-called ""DNS cache"", which means that you can directly connect to the IP without having to go through the DNS servers. Simply put, if you reddit a lot, the browser will remember where you go and make sure you get there faster.

----

**So what will happen now, is the internet doomed or what?**

No. I'm guessing that some AT&amp;T network techs had a busy night and will have to set up some emergency backups till stuff's sorted. Until that happens you're out of internet, but I'm sure you've got other things to do, right? Right?

Pretty much.

FlyingSpaghettiMan,paradoxplaza,1389639236.0,"Our tutorials and guides section can show you how to make AARs in a vague sense. However, there are some prevalent ways to do so:

 * [Timelapse](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1s42x0/howto_shooting_a_timelapse_in_any_of_the_paradox/) - by far the easiest and most complete way to do it. Requires literally no effort beyond uploading to YouTube and setting the program up.

 * [An Imgur Album](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/comments/1li7o2/a_preemptive_strike/) - this requires you to take pictures of every 'milestone' event that you have. Basically, whenever you feel good about yourself, take a screenshot and think of a funny caption. Then, upload all the images you took as an album to imgur. Sort the images by filename, and write captions for each image. Being witty and interesting is a good way to farm upvotes / get your story seen. The frequency of how much you screenshot is determined by whether or not the AAR is supposed to be a guide, a showoff, or a mix. I linked the CURRENT TOP IMGUR AAR OF ALL TIME TO STROKE MY EGO. 

 * Selfpost. Selfposts are few and far between, but they are good if you don't have many / any pictures, and just want to share your story. They tend to not get many upvotes, but they do get a lot of replies.

 * Comics. If you can turn your AAR into a well made comic, the subreddit will collectively jizz.

Of course, people love humor. AARs without a tinge of humor are usually not upvoted, so try to be a lil witty or at least have some very compelling use of tactics in order to interest people. 

Here is our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza/wiki/aartools) on AAR tools. It is in desperate need of attention, but I am lazy. If someone would be awesome enough to volunteer to add stuff, just reply to this message and I'll add you as an editor for the page.

Thats not a good way to disagree that race is a context in someones argument. Notice how im not saying you dont get to have an opinion because you're white. *That* would be SRS. *That* would be tumblrkin.

&gt; What matters is what I say, not the person who is saying it.

While i disagree, even if you were objectively correct that race has zero relevance to the context of an opinion on BHM, i addressed more than race in my post, so why have you chosen to leverage it as the *entirety* of your dismissal?

&gt; I am more than willing to discuss this issue with you 

False. You responded to:

&gt; &gt; So when do you suggest it should be ended, how, and for what stated reason. Remember, politicians have to do this for it to happen. How are you gonna win over the people to your idea?

with:

&gt; If I were given absolute power, though, I'd simply replace it with American history month, where schools would teach about our history from our origins as insurgents against the British empire to the modern day.

Its not exactly a discussion of how to proceed with your idea beyond, replace it, with absolute power, for a US history month with, as you describe, an emphasis on revolution against the British, largely a white history, already taught in schools.

No mention of how to approach the black community with something better, or engaging with community leaders over some compromise. Fuck em, 'murrica? Amirite.

&gt; Be specific about what you disagree with

I've opened specific fronts of conversation, and you've been pretty apathetic about everything else besides it being ridiculous and needing shutting down.

If you care, you can extract some points from the posts, rather than me repeating myself. Remember, people, a whole nation and its government need to move forwards with something. Just saying you dont like it, is nothing more than whining."

Duckylicious,gameofthrones,1389639655.0,"Sansa's my favorite by now too, and not just because so many other people hate her. Yeah, I couldn't stand her in season 1 either, and more than once I threw a certain expletive at her that's usually reserved for Cersei. But a) that was before I knew what an assholish world this story is set in - all things considered, is being a teenager really that bad of a crime? b) I think she's been quite punished enough c) her character development arc is one of the better ones.

She may not be ""badass"" in the way that Arya is, but she has strength. We also have to remember that while we might scoff at a girl who enjoys sewing, singing, dancing and fairy tales and prefer to see warrior type strong female characters, those are the things she's been told all her life are her primary purpose if she wants to be good at being a lady. She's their equivalent of a straight A student who also rules the drama club and debate team. 

[AFFC/ADWD](#b ""She is also the only character whose fate I actually care about at this point, as both Arya and Daenerys get excessively tedious in the later books. Being driven to lose yourself in becoming a faceless killer out of revenge is not admirable, and Daenerys seems to be having some sort of brain aneurysm."")

Edit to add: The two situations that most people hold against her are the Arya/Joffrey/Nymeria/Lady incident and ratting Ned out to Cersei. I think she did the best thing she could under the circumstances in the first scenario, even if it was infuriating to watch at the time, by trying to stay out of it. She can't publicly call the prince a liar, especially if she's also supposed to marry him. The Cersei thing was a dick move, but I think Ned carries the brunt of the blame for what happened to him, for being blind to what was going on around him and dogmatically sticking to his honor code even when it meant risking his family's lives. Sansa had no way of knowing the consequences of what she did - and yet she got nailed with the uneasy feeling that her father's death was her fault anyway. Give her a break."

Sacks, one of the most exciting events in the game, are over very quickly a lot of the time. In football, plays are so important and oftentimes exciting that I'd be overwhelmed if I wasn't given some time to digest them.

OHotDawnThisIsMyJawn,Fitness,1389639929.0,You still haven't mentioned where you are.  If you're not downtown in a big city then you really have no point of comparison.  There are probably one or two gyms that are super cheap in Manhattan but none of them are convenient and when you're taking public transportation everywhere you might be looking at adding 20-30 minutes each way to your trip.  Given that I'm going 12 times a month I will gladly pay an extra $20 - $40 a month to save myself hours of commuting.
speedofdark8,AskReddit,1389639933.0,"This will probably be buried but as someone that is budding into travelling i thought it would be worthwhile to share my experience. 

I've been to Italy, Greece, and Ireland, having gone to Italy/Greece in my first trip and Ireland my second. I went to the former in a tour group with a translator and all sort of other stuff provided (hotels, some meals, travel plans, etc). I didn't speak the language(s) so the translator and the spoonfed tours were an amazing way to go into a foreign land and get the most out of it. If you want to visit a place to see the landmarks and history while seeing the beauty of the countrysides between cities, then a tour group is top notch.

I went to Ireland independently. Basically, i flew to Dublin and then decided what I wanted to do, threw plans together, and did it. While I wouldn't recommend something this haphazard, it worked out really well for me in the long run. I have great memories of doing whatever I wanted thousands of miles from home. However, i think i was only able to do this since the language barrier wasn't there. 

If you only speak English like I do, then I'd highly recommend going to a region that is primarily English speaking (Ireland, UK, Wales, Scotland, Australia, etc). This way you can experience everything and learn how stuff works in another country without missing things due to language. Once you're more well traveled, then I'd say you'd be ""ready"" to venture to foreign speaking lands.

So tldr, if you want to go individually and have your own adventure, English speaking place. For non-English places, tour groups."
Dajbman22,AskMen,1389639938.0,"A BF may not like the answer, ""I've tried it, and just don't like it"", but it is the honest answer, and thus the best one if you want things to last with the guy. Sometimes you can't avoid making someone feel jealous or frustrated. The best you can do is be understanding of whatever reaction he may have, and work with him to find something to make him feel included and wanted. You shouldn't force yourself to do anything you do not want to do. While a good number of guys enjoy anal sex, and just as many, if not more, get all hung up about issues around their partners' pasts... neither is a hard-and-fast rule of all guys. That's why you should never go in assuming your BF is going to react like the most upvoted guy on reddit. You know him better than any of us, and tailor your words to him and his personality. With that, the bridge can be easily crossed and you can move on. "

The place where the truth might hurt feelings, for me, would be if you said you liked it with a previous boyfriend but didn't want to do it with me. That would throw up a red flag, unless there was a good reason (like if I had a way thicker dick or something, and you were afraid it would hurt). "

pfromad,TwoXChromosomes,1389640130.0,"I had some stuff leftover from childhood that would 'trigger' me, or in other words cause me to relive painful memories and put me off my baseline for days. 

The answer is that the triggers don't stop until you process how the traumatizing experience is affecting your life. This is a very difficult process because what abuse or traumatic experience generally does is to cause the victim to behave in maladaptive ways in various settings and this realization process does not coincide well with our desire to think of ourselves as good people. 

The truth is that suffering people do not behave very endearingly when they are suffering. (That is putting it mildly.)

So once you're ready to consider the possibility that your own behavior is sometimes not ideal, you're ready to 'get over it.'"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389640526.0,"&gt;That's a big 'If'.

Why?  Why can't it be how it actually is?  You're making a pretty strong assumption.  Instead of believing everything she said is right, you're believing everything she said is wrong.  Why not just try to be neutral?

&gt;You're assuming this is an unbiased account. 

No, I'm not.  I'm saying she should describe it to the best of her ability.  I'm not making any assumptions.  You, on the other hand, are assuming everything she's saying is wrong and so incredibly biased that we should either ignore everything she says or assume everything is the opposite.  How is that at all productive?

&gt;Her willingness to publicly bad mouth her boyfriend is an issue. 

How is she badmouthing anyone?  She's explaining a situation.  That's not badmouthing.  And this isn't really public as there is no way to identify her.  It's a way for her to get perspective, but instead of telling her friends about how they fight, she's getting generic advice from people that don't know them at all.  

&gt;We don't have his version and, again, we have no reason to assume that she's providing an unbiased version of events.

And we have no reason to assume the opposite either.  I don't take issue with saying ""is it possible that you're starting the arguments?""  But if all you're doing is ignoring what she says and saying that she must be wrong because she's biased, how are you helping at all?  What if everything she says is true?  If you really think she's so biased that her story is 100% incorrect, then give both sides.  It's still an assumption, so I don't see how what you're doing is any better.  

&gt;Is it? She didn't ask how to do that.

No, but why can't we tell her it's the correct way to go about things?  Again, I'm not assuming anything of their situation, but telling her that they need to work on discussing their problems without shouting and placing blame works *regardless* of whether or not everything she said is the truth.

&gt;That, in and of itself, is very revealing.

Yes, and she even explained that herself - she just thinks they have differing ways of dealing with conflict - he gets angry and she retreats.  She probably doesn't realize they can avoid this altogether.  I mean, this nearly proves my point - we can place the blame on her all day long, but in the end, **placing blame accomplishes nothing.  Just solve the damn problem.**

&gt;If she wants to solve the problem, then we need to understand the causes of the problem.

But the problem comes from placing the blame!  Read what she said - they try to figure out whose fault it is, and then it becomes emotionally heated.  Gee, I wonder what the problem is.

&gt;She claims that he's being childish and takes no responsibility for her role in the situation.

She's painting the picture.  I've been with people that get so angry they can't discuss anything, so I know exactly what she's talking about.  She said in another comment that she gets defensive which can exacerbate the problem, which she realizes.

&gt;Where are you getting that? Where does she show responsibility? Look at what she wrote:

&gt;&gt;It usually goes: disagreement of some sort, **arguing over the particulars of who's fault it is**, he starts to get very f'ed off, it turns to shouting, I get upset and we retreat to other rooms whilst he is pissed off and I'm upset

To me, the problem is arguing over whose fault it is, as this is irrelevant.  Find out the problem and find a solution.  Pointing fingers isn't solving anything, but that seems to be what they're doing.  It's obviously both their faults for trying to place the blame on the other, and therefore, both are responsible.  

&gt;The start and escalation of the arguments are presented in a completely impersonal manner.

You know what's childish?  Playing the ""who started it"" game.

&gt;Because she's the one who decided to be vague regarding what the arguments are about. Because even the vague description she's given us shows a process of escalation, and escalation is a dynamic process, it has two sides. Because her public emasculation of her boyfriend speaks of a disrespect for him, which would infuriate most men if it was evidenced in a private argument.

Clearly, this points all fingers at her.  Seriously?

Villaintine,TheRedPill,1389641013.0,"It depends entirely how you decide to group and view the statistics- these stories always group things that could very well be unrelated and try to guide your perception- that's just effective writing. For example:

&gt;•75 percent wish they had devoted more time and energy to education and career — relative to 58 percent of the general population.

Nowhere does it state that these women started families instead. perhaps they just spent more time on frivolous activities or working a dead-end job instead of pursuing education or better employment.

&gt;•73 percent wish they had made better financial decisions over the course of their lives — and so did 65 percent of the total survey group.

Again this says nothing specific regarding families- perhaps it's just wishing she hadn't wasted money on that tramp stamp, purse, or extra pair of shoes. Women are notorious for being higher volume consumers than men.

&gt;•Low-income women are more likely than men to regret tying the knot when they did — 52 percent versus 33 percent.

Notice the key wording ""when they did,"" - perhaps I've been here too long but this just screams that they are jealous of their friends who got to ride the cock carousel while they instead chose to marry.

&gt;•And nearly one-third of low-income women with children wish they had postponed having children — or had fewer of them.

This one occurs to me that women realized they missed out on the carousel or didn't ride as long as they could have and realized they've irreparably damaged their SMV having children during what were likely their highest SMV years."

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskReddit,1389641059.0,"All kinds of fun stuff, most of it probably fabricated.

Two kids caught screwing each other in a bathroom.

One kid caught masturbating during class (I actually saw this happen).

One girl in the same class being physically abused by her preppy boyfriend. She'd show up with bruises everywhere, with him standing around giving her threatening glances. His name was Evan. 

Evan physically assaulted a teacher in front of the entire class. Despite being forty years older, she somehow got him off of her.

The same class organized what was essentially a posse to murder him in retaliation. I was used as insurance since I was only fifteen then and was good at smooth talking my way out of trouble. We physically chased him off of the campus. I had no idea what was going on, and I later found out what they were actually going to do.

A kid in my video broadcast class was caught on security cam buying a hunting knife. He then walked across the street, walked into a pawn shop, and without warning sliced open the stomach of the owner. He hid for two days before being caught by the police. This guy and I were partners in the class, and we had just finished editing a video review segment on holiday films. 

A preppy guy I knew was busted for possession, then paid off the police to drop the charges.

A girl I knew and briefly dated when I was a senior later revealed to me that she was sexually assaulted by a guy while at a movie theater. The rest of the audience watched while it happened, no one did anything to stop them. I'm not sure if this happened, since I wasn't there.

Another girl told me that she was molested by a classmate when he stalked her to her house, checked when she was alone, and threw her on top of a piano and put a switchblade to her throat. I actually know who the guy is, but she received death threats from him, promising to kill her if she told anyone. Having seen the message, I know this one happened.

A teacher was fired for being gay. My high school was full of religious folk.

We were also prohibited from putting on a rendition of ""The Laramie Project"" because it depicts gay people in a positive light.

If I can remember anymore, I'll put them here. For some of them, they were just rumors, so I have no idea if they were true.

He just goes to Thailand for the rest of the year and has fun with his money with his girlfriend there. His retirement plan is basically to save up enough to start a seafood restaurant there. The pictures he has displayed of his lifestyle make it seem idyllic. I do sometimes think of that lifestyle for myself.

He doesn't recommend it though. Greenhorns from all over (felons and others desperate for quick cash) come and they get fleeced for what they're worth before giving up all the time."

Going into OWS, I just went down to the protest because while I didn't want a socialist utopia (although actually, if it were utopia I'd be fine with that despite it not fitting my own philosophies), I was unhappy with the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis and the tone of the American dialogue.

I got pulled in further and further by the things that I saw, the people I interacted with, and the way that people who disagreed responded. By the end of it, many of my views that I hadn't even ""put on the table"" had been changed, because my understanding of reality and what the truth of some things are was also changed.

People are all over this NSA thing now. After my experiences with the FBI, DHS and local law enforcement during Occupy (and some information that anonymous directly provided us that we were later able to verify) nothing Snowden has leaked has surprised me. In fact, I've been surprised at how upset people have been over it.

I'd kind of been under the (mistaken) assumption that it was all an open secret that everyone had meekly accepted.

When I saw the reaction people had to Snowden's disclosures, I briefly got involved with Restore The Fourth to help them anyway I could (since many of them didn't have experience with this type of civic engagement).

There's a lot of people on Reddit that throw stones from glass houses.

The raw data was a stream of XY coordinates to which I added the time, so you could construct a series of images from it.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389641591.0,"&gt; The minimum wage knocks the bottom rung of the employment ladder off, making it harder for those who (to use your own word) are ""worth"" less to the employer than minimum wage.

""worth"" is a relative term. If you get rid of it, a lot of jobs currently ""worth"" more would be ""worth"" less. It's not worth it. Keep in mind, a lot of low wage jobs that currently exist would happily pay you less if it wasn't illegal.

&gt;The only reason minimum wage exists in any form is the ""living wage"" argument, that people need to be able to live off their income. UBI would be handling that aspect of ""welfare"", so you no longer need to be distorting the market with a price floor in minimum wages.

Except people making the min wage as it have to go on welfare to make ends meet. And most realistic proposals only give you min wage wages.

I think if you're spending your time doing something, you should be adequately paid for it. Period. 

I'll shoot it back at you and say the only reason to get rid of the wage is really these free market libertarian ideals I dont subscribe to.

&gt;Also, if you want to have any chance of conservatives agreeing with UBI, you have to do things like eliminate other welfare, including Minimum Wage (which really is just another form of welfare).

They'll never get on board with it, as I already pointed out. You know Obamacare was originally a republican proposal? Yeah, they'll turn on their own ideas for political points. I'm more interested in wooing the VOTER, by making their conditions BETTER than trying to get some turncoat republicans on board in a shaky alliance knowing full well they'll turn it into a political issue next election. That and weakening your own position really does strengthen your own. Because they can then point out the weaknesses you compromised with them on, how it's a worthless program, how it's a failure, and should be repealed...when we put those weaknesses in in the first place because it was the way to get it passed.

So I say screw the right wing. If you wanna maintain your virtues in the long term, don't compromise them because the the opposition will just use the things we compromised on as a rallying cry to push their own viewpoints. I'd rather turn the republican voters against their own party, telling them that their politicians are hurting them....if we don't do that and we compromise, they'll just say we're hurting them because our compromised policy actually DOES hurt people."

My research focuses on illicit markets, drugs and crime. My current research is qualitative in nature and looks at how the rise of online drug marketplaces affect participation in illicit markets as well as how participants conceptualize and mitigate risk. In my full time job I train my states probation, parole, intake officials, and occasionally juvenile correction officers. Due to that role I am familiar with classification, reentry plans, nonviolent juvenile control practices, and current research relating to effective supervision.""

Previously, I worked with a prison education program that brought university students and incarcerated men and women together in the same classroom to learn and interact together, it was incredibly rewarding work and I am still involved helping them evaluate the outcomes of the program. My current research is a bit different, I am a qualitative researcher who talks to sex workers in an attempt to understand how they define the parameters of their jobs and navigate things like social stigma, legal issues, and professional relationships. Lastly, I teach introduction to criminology, which is an amazing amount of fun and deals with the history and philosophy of crime, how we define it, and how we respond to it. I’m always excited to talk to people who are interested in how crime interweaves with society and the human experience.” "

I am fairly sure he has video of me personally, as he would also record kids changing for sketches and presentations in his history class. He had actually been on minor probation beforehand, because he went out and bought a chair that allowed him to look up girls' skirts as they walked to the front of the room and people noticed (remember, Catholic school, so most girls wore skirts, though pants were an option). After he got suspended, he apparently came to the school after-hours, had the janitor let him in, and dumped all of his videos in a dumpster behind the school. They were found the next day by cops.

The second was a brother (like a male nun) at my Catholic high school who was accused of molesting kids in the '70s. He was quickly moved to a retirement home two states away, and died of a heart attack less than a year later."

False equivalency. Strict parenting doesn't guarantee material success, and relaxed parenting doesn't guarantee happiness. We like to think we have a ton of control over either but more than we'd like to admit comes down to random chance. We can do a lot to influence our kids but there isn't a success/happiness continuum that you control with your parenting style.

1.  Definitely get finite numbers from your parents; sit them both down and explain that before you can get any vendors booked, you need to know how much you can spend in total, and that means knowing how much they will contribute.

2.  Discuss with them the general idea of you and your FH have for your wedding (have your FH there if you think it will help, but sometimes having another person there puts parents on edge, like they have to explain themselves).  Ask them if there are any areas where they would like to help with the planning, and discuss from there.

3.  When it comes to ""weird food options,"" ask your mom what she thought was so weird.  Vegetarian fare in general?  Mediterranean fare?  Does she have a vision for a sit-down dinner with all the classic trimmings?

Friends of mine got married on Lake Ray Hubbard, at a hotel there (I can't remember the name, sorry).  It was an outdoor ceremony, then the reception was in a large ballroom in the hotel.  If y'all haven't looked at hotels on the coast, maybe give that a try and see if it's more suited to your mother's liking?

Also the lack of incentive to move up to the lower middle class because then they'd get rewarded by having to start paying an obscene amount of income tax. 

A disgusting amount of our country's wealth gains since the 1970s have been forcibly redistributed to those 1%-ers, so the poor have barely reaped the benefits of our country's economic progress.

Montuckian,AskMen,1389641898.0,"So true.  Story time:

Years ago my best friend was seeing my girlfriend's best friend.  They were shitty for each other, but he was enamored and good looking so she stayed around.

About a year and a half into their relationship, she cheated.  And she was dumb/cocky enough to tell my girlfriend about it.  Who then told me.

So I did what /u/empress-of-blandings suggested and gave his girlfriend an ultimatum that said in three days time I would tell him if she didn't.

She told him alright.  She told him that my girlfriend and I had contrived a story in order to blackmail her into breaking up with him because we were jealous or some shit.  To normal people this would sound like the BS it was, but my buddy was enamored and bought it.

They eventually broke up on their own terms, but ended up dragging my girlfriend and me through the mud for six weeks while they were going about it.  Eventually she cheated again and it got back to him through some random who he believed.

Morals of the Story (and for OP):

1. There is no way this ends well.


2. He's more committed to her than he is to you.
3. She's more committed to the lie than she is to you.
4. She's not using you as a means of support, she's using you for a partner.  She's sharing her lie in order to spread out her guilt and get confirmation that it's okay with the hope that ***you'll help her get away with it.***
5. The best thing that you can do is to distance yourself from her completely.

6. If you feel morally obligated to tell him, send it in an anonymous letter addressed to him at a place where she can't intercept it (e.g. work).  Removing yourself from the equation makes it so that you can't be attacked personally and can't have your character brought into the argument, which will happen."

Today, ATMs handle a far larger volume of transactions than tellers do - it's not even close.

These machines will become more common as people get comfortable using them and as restaurants get used to managing them.  Kinks and glitches will get ironed out, the cost of maintaining the devices will fall quickly, and the ordering interfaces will get more intuitive.  The novelty stage will pass quickly and then the preference cascade enters stage right.

The price of the machines doesn't have to fall much, and minimum wage doesn't need to go up.  All that's required is time for these things to improve and expand from their current niche.  They're coming, regardless of policy, wages, or other irrelevant laws."

UW and FoW were easier, but 1 fuckup was enough to get your entire party kicked out of the instance, so there was actually a really big risk tied to invincitanking there.

Our different attitudes probably just come down to being tall is generally perceived as a positive, so that helps to offset problems for us. However being short is generally perceived as a negative and the advantages that it brings don't really seem to offset that for a lot of short people."

mr_fishy,TwoXChromosomes,1389642116.0,"In my experience, triggers aren't that predictable. You never really know when it will happen, and it might never go away. I haven't lived with my abuser for almost four years now and I still get anxiety attacks occasionally.

However, talking to a therapist and other survivors about it has helped me gain perspective and practice coping mechanisms for it. So even though the triggers haven't gone away, they don't affect me quite as badly because now I handle them a lot better. So there's that.

As far as moving on, you aren't ""supposed"" to do anything. You don't just ""get over"" abuse - it stays with you pretty much forever. But it usually starts to affect you less and less, gradually over time. Just take things at your own pace and do what's healthy for you. Talk to a therapist or abuse counselor if you aren't already. Do things a day at a time. Eventually it will get better."
turtlehana,loseit,1389642118.0,"I watched Fat Sick and Nearly Dead. I did the diet for 6 weeks and dropped 15lbs last year and my husband lost 30lbs. 

Our friend started it as well, he did it for a week and lost 15lbs. He was around 350lbs when he started. 

It is probably confirmation bias but as soon as we were off we gained all it back. My husband and our friend gained even more back. 

Additionally it is a lot of prep and clean up. We missed the act of eating and it didn't teach us life long skills in good health. Though I did start to like more veggies this way.

poesie,AskWomen,1389642165.0,"&gt;From what I've seen ""anti-choice"" is a rhetorical tactic used to make pro-choice people feel more satisfied with themselves while alienating people who identify as pro-life.

Well that seems pretty rude as 'pro-life' as a term alienates pro-choice people. That is not about life, that is about taking choice away from other people. Just because you know people who are ""all about social and political safety nets,""  that doesn't mean those people are not completely against a woman's right to choose what she wants to do with her own body. 

&gt; I think it's important to be careful about caricaturing either side, especially if you want to actually convince anyone to change their minds about things.

Thanks, I suppose, but I don't need your advice. I am of the opinion that nobody will change their mind on this issue from some comments on a website or from a friend or whatever. 

I used to think I was pro-life until women's abortion rights were threatened in the US. Then I realized I was pro-choice. Nobody could have changed my mind and can't now, and I don't see the point to changing anyone else's mind - I just want abortion rights preserved. "

Same with home schooling, have people at my church who home school and those whose kids go to a regular school and everyone respects each other's decisions when it comes to that. 

While my church is very much Bible study focused it is also a modern church which puts the Bible's teachings in a context relevant for us today and the reality today is that not everyone can afford to be a stay at home mom. I think as with everything else in life balance is important, you should work if that makes you happy but you shouldn't work so much that you don't have time for your family, even my husband says that he never wants to be a CEO of a company (even though he definitely has the brains for it) because he knows it will consume too much of his time and to him time with me (and our children when we have them) is more important than career/money, that's why I love him. Don't get me wrong, he is driven in his career and he has achieved a great amount for his age - he is the leader of his department and he is the youngest one there, but he just knows when to stop and what his priorities are so he never wants work to take away from his family and I think that's what's important for both sexes.

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389642234.0,"1.  I agree with other posters; diet is much more important than exercise for weight loss, so get that downpat before you start some super vigorous training program.

2.  I lost 90lbs over 1.5 years and have kept 70lbs off.  I still have to get back to where I was, and then some, since  want to look my absolute best on my wedding day.  That said, I mostly cook at home (so I can measure and control portion size), but I allow myself one ""cheat meal"" at a restaurant each week.

3.  Recording what you eat (I use MFP, too) and measuring for portion control is essential.  This alone can be your strategy.  You want to get lots of protein to satiate your hunger, and lots of veggies for nutrients.  Fruit has a lot of sugar, so while you should def have it and dairy, focus more on veggies.

4.  Carbs aren't even, but they less calorie-dense than veggies or lean meats.  Having a serving of rice or potatoes will look minute, but having 1 serving of veggies next to it will look like a mountain of food.  Train yourself to fill your plate with veggies first, then add your lean meat and then your carb.

5.  Any activity is better than no activity.  Go for a walk while you call vendors or your BMs about wedding planning.  Set up an exercise bike while you watch TV.

6.  Keep healthy and portion-sized snacks in your house, or try to remove snacks all together.  Depending on the kind of person you are, snacking can be your savior (keeps you from reaching for seconds at the next meal) or your doom (you just keep snacking over and over and end up eating a meal just in snacks, but then still eating your next meal).

7.  ALWAYS count liquid calories.  Beer, juice, coffee/tea (low numbers, but still numbers), milk, etc."

Minimum wage jobs are incorrectly named; they should not be the sole supply of income (especially if you have a family). They should be called ""minimum skill"" jobs. Some will help you acquire skills required to move up career-wise; some will not.

If you don't want to stay in a minimum-wage job for the rest of your life, you need to work hard in school, acquire as much job experience as you can when its easy to get (working in HS, internship in college, etc.), and have a polished resume complete with volunteering and personal development. Prove that you're worthy of being paid better, provide more value for the company, and you'll be rewarded with a larger paycheck.

JedLeland,atheism,1389642356.0,"I'm not a big *Enterprise* fan.  I watched the first couple seasons mostly out of inertia; I'd been watching modern *Trek* since TNG premiered in '87 and before that I'd watched TOS non-stop in syndication. The new show really just wasn't doing it for me; it felt stale and out of date. I perked up a bit when I heard the third season was going to be serialized a la *DS9*, but about a third or so of the way through, I realized I just didn't care where they were going and I did the unthinkable: I abandoned a *Star Trek* series.  A couple years ago I watched the final season on Netflix after hearing so much so many people say that that's where the show finally found its feet. Season four is indeed quite a bit better than what came before, although I don't love it the way a lot of fans do. I still haven't seen the last two thirds or so of season three. Avoid the series finale like the clap.

As with all things, YMMV (except on that last point; seriously, ***do not watch the series finale***)."

Zscooby13,AskReddit,1389642548.0,"My brother and a few friends of mine did some research into our school's handbook and realized that we might be able to get away with bringing the toy lightsabers into school.

Originally, we were planning on just wearing them on our pants, because we just wanted to have a bit of fun going around the rules. However, some of my friends thought it would be much more fun to stage a big fake fight in the center of the school's common area.

Naturally, the dumbest idea won, and we decided that the next day, we would all meet up during lunch and have our battle in front of everyone. 

About seven of us formed a circle and started to ""fight."" It only took a couple of minutes for some of the administration to show up and start yelling for us to stop.

They took my brother and I into the disciplinarian's office and started threatening us with suspensions and expulsions, but we just laughed and asked her which rule we had broken. 

After spending about an hour going through all of the rules and having them be unable to catch us on one of them, they let us go back to class.

From that point on, some of my nerdier teachers only referred to me as the Jedi Master and the next year, the school updated the handbook to include a ban on plastic lightsabers.

Saiokuo,Anxiety,1389642582.0,"I'd say yes. I had a complete personality reversal between childhood and adulthood (which is rather uncommon).

As a kid I was quite extroverted, wild, and not very good at thinking things through. By the time I graduated high school I was the complete opposite; I avoided strangers and spent most of my free time alone. I won't give bullying all the credit as anxiety disorders tend to develop around the teen years and that probably had a lot to do with my reversal but bullying certainly encouraged it. Why be outgoing and forward if every time you are its met with criticism and harassment?

He seemed really religious, posting a lot of ""thank you god for everything he had'"" but I overlooked that and he overlooked that I am an atheist. We met at a gas station BC I wasnt sure how to get to his house (I drove an hour to meet him). 

He told me he could drive us and I could leave my car but we were at an insanely busy gas station and I don't know the neighborhood so I suggested I follow him back to his house since I felt safer knowing my car wouldn't be broke into or stolen. He seemed really aggravated and made an excuse to call his ""landlord"" so I got in his truck to wait. He immediately locked the door which freaked me out. The guy was BUILT and quite intimidating so I wasnt scared we  would have any trouble. He gets off the phone and says its impossible for me to park my car at his house and starts the truck like we are leaving. I said I would just drive and he could lead the way to the restaurant. He didn't seem to like that. And tried to make a joke of tying me up. Scared the shit out of me but I stayed calm. The guy was hot and I was all for fucking him later on but he started making even more creepy comments and trying to touch me. He wrapped his arm around me and his strength was obvious and scary. He pulled my legs apart without even trying and I was terrified I was about to get raped. A truck pulled in front of us and that made him back off. I told him to unlock the door and he argued. I stared at him until he did. I got out and started back to my car. He started screaming obscenities at me across the parking lot and getting looks from everyone around. He spun out of the parking lot and posted on his FB that night that he ""just didn't have any luck and always ran into crazy bitches but he knew god would give him a good woman"". Yeah.

Navi1101,AskReddit,1389642685.0,"She was a drug addict in her late teens, and part of her cleaning-up process involved getting deep into Paganism and polyamory (we were raised Catholic). She's since moved to Oregon and is raising a beautiful hippie family. My parents are proud of how far she's come, but still grumble about the ""godless"" way she raises her kids and hope she'll find Jesus soon. Meanwhile, the fuck-ups she made in her druggie days - stealing from the family, keeping bad company, etc.; usual addict stuff - make it hard for them to trust her. When she's visiting our hometown, they forbid her to reconnect with anyone from her past, because even though she only means to check in on them and help them out if they need, they don't trust her not to relapse, because she did that a few times as a teen.

I also moved far away from our hometown. My parents and I have a sort of don't-ask-don't-tell policy regarding my polyamory and my mental illness (depression), and I go to church with them when I visit for holidays because I enjoy the spiritualness and the family time. But they don't know how much I drink, or that most of my friends are both ents and perfectly successful people (these traits are incompatible as far as they're concerned), or that I've had a couple other boyfriends beside the one I live with, or tht I haven't been to church on my own in ages (I get my spiritual study through aikido these days), or that I cry myself to sleep quite often because my brain doesn't function correctly. The less they know about how *not* a model Christian woman I am, the better.

So basically mine and my sister's relationships with our parents revolve mostly around keeping secrets from them so they don't have a conniption. Except she's always been a lot more honest about her ""mistakes"" - what they would consider mistakes, because she took a hard road and didn't grow up precisely into the person they wanted - than me. I don't talk to them much, but I also don't want them to think they're horrible parents or that they failed at raising both of their kids, so when I do, it's slanted to preserve my image as their healthy, smart, morally clean child, to balance out my sister's brutal honesty."

mongoosedog12,AskReddit,1389642898.0,"I will preface this with my high school is small. 19 kids were in my graduating class. 

Well each quarter my school has something called intercession where we do different activities for a week. When you're a junior one of the intercession is something called junior week. Where you stay on campus for a week and go over how to write college essays, fill our applications, do interviews and take SAT. 

Well the class before me decided to make it a 'real college experience' , while the teachers were asleep, (the separated  the boys from the girls and had one teacher sleeping in each building) the students decided to run around the school in the underwear or naked and take pictures. Some people had sex in the bathrooms and they smoked and drank as well. 

Now the kicker is, they got away with it. They knew about it and so did my class, because some of us were close to them. But no teachers knew. However, one girl who didn't participate in the actives decided it was too much to hold in and tell the principal. Because my school is Montessori and all about feelings. They made the people who participated in the events apologize to the whole school. The principal even made them come up with ways they were going to restore the community since they 'hurt' it. 2 students were expelled, they were the ones who brought the weed and alcohol.

Oh a smaller level the next year, my senior year. There was a bully scandal. Apparently people we're getting bullied on social media. This caused my principal to bring in counselor for about 2 months where each class was divided by gender and met with a consular during lunch. "

I am quite sensitive to caffeine, although tea (green, earl grey) is great once in a while.  Energy drinks and coffee give me migraines.

I smoke weed perhaps once every other day.  I find it relaxing, but: I rarely smoke outside of my home, have never sold, and am certainly not addicted. It's ""legal"" and I like it....

In college I drank quite heavily - at least for someone my size.  I did not  ""party"" often, but I would binge drink myself into a stupor maybe once a month.  In one singular instance I probably should have had a precautionary ambulance called, and I never want to be there again.  I quit for quite a while after that, but now I just enjoy a new craft brew every so often, along with the occasional binge on the beach or frolf course.  It's pretty difficult to be ""against"" alcohol imo.

I've tried shrooms twice, and both were a pleasurable experience, but I found it exhausting.  I'm all for it.

I've yet to form an opinion about LSD, and I have absolutely no desire to try DMT (very intense), although both do seem interesting.  Because of neurological and cardiological(?) issues, I will not try cocaine or ecstasy, and because of the dangers they can present to any user, I do not approve of their use.  I have heard nothing but horror stories regarding heroin or meth, and I really think it's stupid to get involved in that.

I'm just coming back to the game now and, while I don't think I'm going to be nearly as devoted this time around, I'm still having lots of fun with the class.  So feel free to let me know if you have any questions! I've been doing my best to catch myself up on the stuff I missed, so hopefully I can help.

Regarding leveling, I think the most important thing to do is whatever sounds like the most fun at that moment.  It will keep you entertained and you won't burn out as quick.  On my first character, I did every side quest and flashpoint plus every pvp and space daily.  That quickly out-paced my story quests, so after a few planets of this I started skipping lots of side quests until I caught up.  

Now, when I level characters, I really only do class quests, since the other side stuff on the planets are the same for every class, but I'll mix it up with pvp, flashpoints, and now GSF as I see fit.  It's all pretty good xp, particularly if you're doing daily/weekly quests for it.  Just keep in mind that most of those things (warzones, flashpoints, space missions, GSF) will still be fun and rewarding at 55, questing probably won't be.  Particularly on lower-level planets.  There are some really cool stories mixed in the planet quests that are worth checking out."

At $10/hour, that is an unreasonable cost.

That is why NetFlix is so popular - the cost for the ability to *rewatch* something is much, much lower than $20 per title, and people would be willing to pay much higher rates than NetFlix's subscription fee **if** the quality of the content were worth it.

I would be willing to bet that a LOT of people would pay $30-50/month for access to all movies and TV shows 2-3 months after DVD release date. That is a significant amount more than NetFlix charges, but that has to be compensated by a larger quantity of popular videos."

goodguy101,martialarts,1389643083.0,"What always happens in this sub is you will get MANY different variations of what to do. Some good, some bad, but none of it will work if you do not practice it with another person.

I do Muay Thai. If someone is trying to ""tee off"" on me, I will want to either:

  A) While guarded, get distance between me and them by side stepping and rocking them back or a really powerful teep.

 B) While guarded, lock them inside and control them with a clinch. Then knee them into submission.

Nothing will work if you do not practice over and over so that your body remembers what to do even when you get rocked.

WithMyFaceInMyPalm,AskMen,1389643152.0,"It's more of a gesture than a requirement.

If you had a partner who never experienced anal and wanted to at least once what would you say? ""Sorry, I've done it once, but I'm not going to let you have that experience ever in your life as long as you're with me"".

You put the sacrifice on them, and make no sacrifice for yourself and that's selfish. Once or twice would be a compromise.

If a guy is really into anal then I would lean toward nope, never, not once. If a guy just wants to try it, the respectful thing to do would be to let him once or twice - providing you are really into each other and see the relationship going somewhere. If you really hate it that much and explain why you hate it, then the guy should respect you, not push you for it, and decide whether or not it's a dealbreaker for him.

For me, never done anal on purpose and don't have a desire to, but I still expect the gesture from girls with whom I am in a relationship with.

What do I mean by expect? I will make a joke about anal, if she says nope, never I will start a dialogue about why. If the dialogue still ends with nope, never, then I know I am not being respected in the relationship. Generally speaking anyway, I mean if she had her butthole ripped and bleeding the one time she tried and it was a total nightmare then nope, never is fine. If it was mildly unpleasant... nope, never just isn't going to fly."

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389643159.0,"&gt; No, worth is not relative. An employee always benefits a business by X amount of dollars per hour. If I own a diner, it costs me (say) $6/hour to use paper and plastic (and throw it out), so when that person I was paying to wash dishes now costs $8/hour, I am going to swap to using paper/plastic and let the dishwasher go.

While true, with NO minimum wage, they'll try to work people for $2 and pocket the other 4. You NEED a balance.

And with UBI probably allowing some to leave the workforce, I doubt unemployment will be as much of a problem as it is now. As long as unemployment isnt out of control it'll matter little. Keep it as it is. 

&gt;Right, so any job you took (even if it were $3/hour) would result in you earning more money than you used to on minimum wage.

No, your LABOR is worth less then. UBI is meant to be a form of wealth redistribution for me as well, without drastically affecting the labor market. If you've noticed, top quintle shares have gone up at a ridiculous rates while everyone else's purchasing power has declined. UBI is a way to even things out, and removing min wage takes that away.

&gt;But giving someone $10/hour to do something that is only earning $3/hour is welfare. UBI replaces welfare.

No it's not. That is a horrible argument. Welfare isn't wages.

&gt;I am not talking republican leadership, I am talking republican voters. Any proposal you make that is not even slightly appealing to these people is simply wasted breath.

""your taxes will go down after you deduct UBI from your new tax rates""....and the republicans cheer. Except the rich elites. On the other hand, if you eliminate the minimum wage, and the wage structure is depressed, a lot of people will lose their job or take a cut and pay while having higher taxes. ""Thanks Obama"" (or whoever is president when it gets elected).

You're not offering any argument I haven't heard before. I don't care about business costs beyond how it affects everyone. As I said, if we're gonna talk about the minimum wage, it should be AFTER UBI is implemented, where we have a better idea of what we're doing. To pull min wage out from under people even if we give them a replacement, is a horrible idea. "

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1389643179.0,"Is 20% really enough, though? Cost of sale is just under 10% (6% commissions plus 3% concession, or 5% price cut under market plus 4% commissions is how I figure it), so that only covers a 10% drop in appraised value, which isn't much of a buffer in many markets.

If you really want to be risk averse, you need to _create_ value, not purchase it.  Even if you _can_ sell by putting 20% down, you are still losing money.  ""Never lose money"" is the first rule of investing. This distinction is the major factor that differentiates successful investors from unsuccessful ones.  Anecdote: our last home acquisition utilized a 5% down purchase via 80/15/5.  We purchased at $140k with concessions towards closing.  Appraisal was $160k.  We used some of what would have gone to a 20% downpayment for improvements, and are currently at a $190k appraisal.  Total out of pocket to date: $22k (including closing costs and downpayment).  Total outstanding debt: $133k.  Total equity captured after expenses: $35k.  If worse comes to worse, we could sell the house at $10k under market and still realize a profit of over $10k after cost of sale.  We now have a great margin of safety, and increase our net worth by $35k in the process.  Or we could have spent $6k more on a downpayment, and be living in a rather shabby house with a very small margin of safety.  Which one is riskier?  

A successful investor does not trade money for value, they create value by identifying assets that offer a return greater than their current price indicates.  A house is generally the largest single purchase most people make, and by viewing that purchase from the perspective of a consumer rather than that of an investor, you do a great disservice to your financial well-being."

* 6 single crochets in the first 6 stitches, then 'turn 2 stitches into 1' once.

I'm talking about the frustration on that sub of short men being mostly undesirable to taller women due to their height. I'm 90% certain this one thing is the cause of a *huge* amount of the negativity on that sub, which breeds a cycle of negativity that is even more of a turn-off to women.

That Exposing Heightism twitter, while being mostly composed of young and immature girls, is basically a constant feed of girls stating that short guys are undatable. That is not heightism, IMO. Short guys are getting frustrated because it seems that no matter what they do, all things being equal they can never be as attractive to a girl as a taller man."

However, I do think there is a reasonable desire for women to lead the movement rather than men and thus why sometimes it is important to distinguish men in the movement as having a lesser role. It is because it is already easy for men to speak up in society. Men are taught to have voices and opinions and to take leadership roles and women more often are not -- coincidentally this is an issue for the feminist movement. For feminists to not counterbalance against this amongst themselves would be contradictory.

So, when other feminists ask men to consider themselves allies rather than feminists, I think it is fair to ask, however it is up to those men to decide for themselves if they will concede; for, their identity is theirs to decide upon. Of course, all men within the movement should be careful to allow women to speak their minds, often first and only."

You seem obviously concerned about ""career politicians,"" but I don't think you quite understand the reality of how governments function, and how the solutions you propose would actually exacerbate the very problems you seek to address.  Allow me to explain.

Any Cascadian government is going to require some amount of bureaucracy.  It is an unavoidable by-product of government, and the greater our expectations of government, the greater the level of bureaucracy.  Bureaucrats are hired employees of the government, and not elected.  They persist while politicians come and go, and are not easily untrenched.

In the sort of system you describe, all power ends up in the hands of these bureaucrats.  The citizen politicians arrive in Olympia (or wherever) with no idea what they have to do, how everything works, and facing a steep learning curve.  They rely on the entrenched bureaucracy to manage itself while they learn the ropes of governance.  By the time they have started to master the system, they get sent home.  This creates a bureaucracy that is well-adjusted to running on its own, setting its own goals, working for its own purposes.  Nor will the lobbyists disappear; they'll just be lobbying the bureaucrats.

...

I think a better model would be a tax code that encourages worker-owned collective corporations centered around community owned banks; small, independent businesses and self-employment.  I look at the [Mondragon Corporation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation) as a [model for the future](http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/classes/powpart/benellomondragon.html).

I'd like to see the state take a less direct role in managing the economy overall.  Democratic workplaces *should* be more worker-friendly and more environmentally responsible, and better at self-regulation.  I'd rather the state focus on arbitration, defense and law enforcement.  Delegate economic regulatory authority to trade federations, labor unions and consumer groups.

I'd also like to get rid of most taxes and fees.  A small and graduated income tax and [georgist land tax system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgist) should be more than sufficient to cover the needs of the state.  A permanent trust along the lines of the [Alaskan Permanent Fund](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Permanent_Fund) should be established so that everyone benefits from the use of our managed resources -- but rather than oil, I would include timber, fisheries, hydropower, basically any revenue stream made possible by use of the natural resources of the Cascadia bioregion."

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1389643531.0,"For a long time, it was very difficult for me to picture ever being a father. The majority of my life had consisted of a great deal of travel that didn't show any promise of slowing down, and I wasn't exactly what many women would call a ""safe bet"" for a long and stable relationship. I just didn't picture myself ever having the kind of lifestyle that was conducive to raising a child.

I met someone who changed my mind on all that. We were married for years before we ever thought of having a child. In hindsight, the time we spent becoming a two-person team was probably one of the most beneficial things that has helped us through parenthood. It was time well-spent in terms of establishing a firm foundation upon which to start a family. We weren't averse to the idea of kids when we got married, we just wanted to spend as much time as we could being married.

We were at a street fair one day when someone handed my wife a puppy, an action which inadvertently triggered a tsunami of reproductive instincts in her. We barely out of our parking spot at the end of that day before she looked me square in the eye and said ""I do not know what is happening to me, but I feel like you need to fuck a baby into me **right now.**"" What can I say? She's a classy lady.

Me? I still hadn't gotten passed the ""never picturing myself with kids"" frame of mind. However, it didn't take long to start wondering just what a little combination of her and I would look like. I started remembering all the moments of discovery and admiration I experienced with the many father figures I had throughout my life. I remembered the things they had taught me about life, love, loss, and other assorted ""L"" words. I began to recognize that there was a deep desire within me to teach those things to someone else.

I remember the first time I saw him. His birth was tumultuous to say the least. There were complications, and both him and my wife nearly died in childbirth. A hospital curtain had been hiding the chaos that was going on below my wife's sternum, and I had stayed up at eye-level with her. While the OR staff worked diligently to successfully complete an emergency c-section while stemming significant blood loss, I was hardly aware of what kind of progress was being made. I had lost my sense of time, but I remember a few tense exchanges from our surgeons followed by a small squawk and a whimper in this tiny voice. I remember the sudden realization that he was, for lack of a better word… *here.*

It's difficult to describe the realization that there is a small bit of ""you"" outside of yourself. Your genetic material helped to craft this tiny little life, and there is a part of you that is going to exist long after you are gone. I remember them handing me this small pink bundle wrapped in swaddling. I looked down at this little face that gave me a surreal sense of familiarity. He wasn't crying. I remember being impressed by that considering what he had just gone through. Looking back, I know the sense of familiarity came from the fact that I was looking into eyes that were *just like mine.* Not only that, but holding your child gives you this sense of certainty and purpose that is nothing short of profound. It was a clarity that I had never known in life. I knew that this little thing in my arms needed me, and that it was my job to give it the best possible shot at life. I remember being completely unafraid of this revelation. In fact, I remember feeling *alive.* Driven, you could say. I couldn't think of anything to say. A small ""Hey, buddy…"" was all I could manage. To this day, it's still my standard greeting for him.

He's getting to the age where standard toddler babble is slowly becoming real coherent attempts at conversation. He is beginning to convey his ideas to me. He's beginning to ask questions. I'm beginning to dream about all the places I can take him. For the last few years, I've felt a sense of adventure that had eluded me for a long time. I have this little blank slate following me around, and I get to the chance to once again experience all the things that blew my mind as a child through a new set of eyes. The world has a certain ""newness"" to it once again. 

There is so much I want to show that kid. I can't wait to do it.

hopewings,Diablo,1389643532.0,"The problem with binomial systems is that at low enough drop rates (i.e. without 350%+ magic find bonus, which is the case going forward into 2.0 and RoS), people can go hundreds of hours without finding a legendary. But if the drop rates were tuned to be higher, it is quite possible for most people to find a few drops after say, 5 hours, but for a few select ""lucky"" people to find ""too many drops"" in the same amount of time.  Those people then complain on the forums that the drop rates are ""too high"" and that their ""endgame"" is ruined, which is something that happened after the F&amp;F RoS beta.

The ultra low drop rates were toward the beginning of D3 Vanilla, and that was one of the reasons why lots of ""casuals"" quit the game.  Some of them even made it into Inferno and would still see maybe only one bad legendary drop after hundreds of hours of gameplay.  Now with RoS and every legendary being account-bound, it is more beneficial for people to have a more consistent experience with regard to legendary drops.  Even the developers have said so themselves and have implemented measures such as magic find not affecting legendary drops at nearly the same rate as now.  This is all to tune the drop rates for a consistent experience.

What the graphs show is that the binomial system can have such large outliers that make it impossible to just ""increase the drop rates"" by themselves.  But a curved system based on various metrics can make the drop rate experience more consistent throughout, especially for casual players who may not put in hundreds of thousands of hours, but rather just a few hours here and there."

Clearly the answer to the problem you describe might be something other than forcing Yelp to disclose private information of its users.

It is in Yelp's best interest to keep its reviews honest and fight the ""astroturf"" opinions. Asking the court to intervene so that you, the private business, can harass private individuals who gave their opinions to Yelp is IMO exactly violating the spirit of journalistic protections. Good guy Yelp is protecting their sources."
gioraffe32,INTP,1389643573.0,"I'm the same way in terms of wanting ""less"" solitude after an extended time of solitude.

My understanding, however, is that introversion/extroversion is centered around what happens during or after social interaction. Not so much on solitude.

Unless you really are a hermit or just can't be alone, the average person wants some solitude or social interaction from time to time. So those fall outside of what introversion/extroversion seeks to define  (IMO).

The people that I hook up with I know quite well and know they don't have STIs or anything of that nature. When I was younger and a bit more promiscuous I didn't care about this but luckily I used a condom for every girl I was with. This is also something that I hope you are doing.

I mentioned these clans because they are social, but attached to srs bsns clan wars clans that are very successful. This bit is important, as it makes it easier to move up into CW clans without much hassle.

 Once you get your e5, consider looking at lower end cw clans such as [BUNEH], that are attached to good clans. Once you get multiple(3 or 4) CW t10s and your skills improve more, move up to mid range cw clans, [DOGE] or if you are good enough, [FOXEY].

At this point, you will be making enough gold to demount modules without even thinking about it, and making minor free xp or low tier premium purcases, and if you are dedicated, will get you t10 reward tanks in the campaigns.

If you really put the effort in, you can get into a top 10 CW clan, -G-, HAVOK, SIMP, OTTER, PBKAC, RELIC, REL-3, BADGR, VILIN, CRABS, membership in these clan means increased attendance and skill requirements, but virtually guarantee t10 reward tanks(if you want them, the only people who didn't get them in these clans are people who didn't want them) and much higher gold intake, often enough to pay for a premium account. on top of this, membership in these clans grants you access to the better tourney teams, which makes even more mad goaldz.

For the first 6 months (maybe more maybe less) after the birth of your first child, your wife/gf/baby mama will be utterly insane.  She will want to and may attempt to kill you or the child.  This shit is real.

Childbirth is probably the most traumatic thing that happens to a person.  And try to help as you might, she will bear the brunt of it - she'll feel fat, she won't feel sexy or secure, her whole life will have been turned upside down, she will never sleep and will have to accustom herself to the reality that this *thing* requires all of her attention and time and will never leave her alone.

Overall, I tend to favour Naked 3 over Smashbox for my everyday eye makeup, but tend to shy away from the darker colours in the palette (like Darkside and Blackheart). My favourite shades thus far have been Limit, Nooner, and Liar. Trick is also nice, but I haven't had much luck with Dust (despite it's good reviews).

Zscooby13,AskReddit,1389643850.0,"First: Recently, I've started work on a new app/social network and I was looking for an iOS developer to partner with. I start asking around my college (in Indiana) to see if I can find anyone, and I get one response. The kid is super cool to hang out with and is a fantastic coder, so I bring him on to the team. 

We start working and are talking about some of the worst places that we have worked before, and he mentions this guy in Florida that he had done a little bit of contract work for. He says that the guy is always running late on payments and that he was always really hard to get in touch with.

I laugh and tell him that it's a huge coincidence, because I also had to work with some guy in Florida designing icons for apps. The guy I worked with was horrible to work with for the same reasons.

Turns out that we were both recruited by the same idiot in Florida to work on the same app together, but never directly spoke to each other. We even grew up in two neighboring towns.

Second: My bride-to-be and I both recently found out that we went to the same day care when we were about a year old. We didn't meet (again, I suppose) until college and after our parents met each other, her family was telling mine about an ornery boy at the day care who was running around biting girls. I was that ornery boy, and I got thrown out after I bit the girl who will one day be my wife."

layoxx,AskWomen,1389643857.0,"The first guy I ever went on a date with was super cute, I really liked him. We went out and he was clearly nervous and such, which was just more adorable. I was too shy to kiss him (highschool and aforementioned first date ever) and I think he was too, so we awkwardly hugged at the end of the night but I was hoping to hear from him again. A month or two passes with no contact so I figure he didn't like me like I thought he did and move on with my life.

Out of nowhere I hear from him again on AIM. He had a great time, etc. and wants to hang out. I say sure, and am pretty excited for a second chance. We go out again, same as before, to shy and such. Again, I don't hear from him for a long time.

The pattern repeats once more. Then after yet another month or two (It's summer by now) I say no thanks to his date request. I know I am too shy to initiate anything and I don't want to be teased around all night, and the months of no talking in between is just making me sad. He flips out over AIM, makes up all of these reasons why he was incapable of talking to me (work, school etc.) I'm pretty done at this outburst. 

Then, suddenly, he is online all the time telling me about his 'gym routines' and how he's got 'crazy abs' and do I want to go to McDonalds with him 'just as friends'? 

No, I do not.

VanguardCynic,CoDCompetitive,1389643880.0,"To the people who are saying OpTic made poor choices regarding player selection, I have to completely disagree.

I don't know why you guys think that this is worse, I mean honestly, when OpTic picked up3 strong AR's I thought everyone's complaining was justified, I mean, how are you going to win a respawn with 3 AR players who don't fit in OBJ roles?

I think people don't like this roster because they're not familiar with the two new players. Let me inform you, MBoZe and Saintss are some of the two most individually talented players in the game. They're better than Killa and MiRx IMO. Their reaction time, their shot, their playstyle. If you're not familiar with these players, let me assure you this isn't a haphazard pick up. 

MBoZe started out a search star and won an MLG event in BO2. Watching Saintss play is incredible. Give them a chance before saying this pick up is a joke, because honestly, their search only got a little weaker and their respawns just got exponentially stronger.

One other thing I need to say, is that at low levels everyone is nearly the same, so you can charge in with a sword and shield and not be much worse off than the fighters, but at higher level there will be no competition no matter how well you prepare. So though you may be tempted to take some skills and feats that allow you the flexibility of combat as well of spells, consider that about level 7 or so, they will become useless and you will just start to die over and over if you continue to participate in front-line combat. The opposite is true as well though, as you progress, your opportunities to get advantages to spellcasting will keep adding up, and if you resist the urge to be able to be in the thick of things now, and spend your skill points and feats with an eye to the future, you will be a serious problem for your opponents at a higher level. For example, right now my sorcerer is level 13, he can cast 6 or 7  spells at most levels except the highest, with metamagic feats, he can fireball over and over at three different spell levels, that's 18-21 fireballs in a row if he wants to. Add flight and invisibility to that, and suddenly that is devastating and difficult to counter. Being a sorcerer, he is not limited to fireballs though, there are many other spells he can throw into the mix instead, and he can do it as needed, unlike a wizard, who may know more spells, but can't actually use them all without a break to rest."

Indeed, already a couple of the serious wineries nearby (which specialize in big dry reds) offer a sweet dessert mead, both to fill the mead niche and to offer something for hummingbird tourists who flit through.

The Army actually **did** carry out elections from two years, the Islamist-supported former president Morsi simply went too far in his blatant opposition to whatever liberal policies that the previous president had, He single-handedly abolished the previous constitution and declared a new constitution that gave him dictator powers over everything (as an example: The laws which he passed COULD NOT BE STOPPED by a court ruling, or by anyone else).. and so on 30/6 people took to the streets, demanding the Army remove him and the rest is history, the real problem is that the U.S-Supported Army enjoys a **huge** hand over the economy, and it is creating a new dictator out of General Abdel Fatah El-Sisy, who is a Nassirist and supports the former dictator Gamal Abdel Nasser, a socialist who loved the USSR and allied with them.

It's not even a nid only tactic. You shoot them with the big scary things to distract them from the sneaky gribblies taking the relic/objective/etc.  That's literally tactics 101."

HollandseHeld,nba,1389643998.0,"I went to see Deron Williams when he played a euroleague game in the Netherlands(he demolished everyone) and the Turkish fans were incredible. There is a big Turkish community in the Netherlands, and they made the best out of it. Respected the game and behaved well, with a lot of encouraging chants. Reminded me of a soccergame."

SloppySynapses,leagueoflegends,1389643998.0,"Lyte (the player behavior specialist at Riot) did a lecture at MIT on their player behavior statistics. 

In the video of the lecture, there is a graph shown of the percentages of player behavior. The left pie chart is the pertinent one to this discussion, if you want to understand the right one go to the video at 4:35ish and watch for about 2 minutes.

92% of players are neutral or good in terms of behavior. 78% are 'good' according to Riot's behavioral team. That's higher than I initially estimated.

So what you're saying is actually 'bullshit', just spouting off your personal opinions and experiences that are based off of your emotions or something.

I'm not talking about toxic environments or blah blah blah, all I was saying is that there's a very low chance that 4 people will gang up on one person and kick them out just because they picked something they didn't like. It's a completely negligible chance.

uselessrandomstuff,tattoos,1389643998.0,"Something the artist I go to told me on a piece I got with writing, that you might want to take into account is that if the writing is too small nobody will be able to tell what it says past a few feet. I went ahead and stuck with the smaller (not THAT small, but smaller than avg.) because I don't really care if people can read it since i got the tattoo for myself, not them. I will admit though that I get alot of people who will ask what it says or say they can't tell what it says, but it doesn't bother me to tell them if they ask. So if it doesn't bother you that you will have to tell people what it says it's up to you. Another option, if you're not absolutely set on cursive, is going with a similar font style. For instance, on mine I went with a font called angel tears which has some similar lines as cursive but is a little more block than traditional cursive so it is more visible and slightly thicker letters so it wont blur as badly over time. Also I can tell you from experience with my tattoo artist, the only thing on any of my tattoos I wish I had done differently was listen to him and make them larger, but that's more personal preference."

Yeah, I just wish Bioware didn't decide to jump for the cheap low-hanging fruit with an emotional baggage train without considering internal consistency. Pointing out that they were largely veterans with battlefield commendations discharged for disciplinary problems would've worked equally well, especially given the backdrop of the Reaper War. Given their competence, you'd have to be a special kind of asshole to get the boot. It's not as if they didn't pull the same shit for Kai Leng, who apparently got discharged for an overdose of asshattery despite being an N7.

Speaking of superpowers, I find it spectacularly ironic that the poster child for steroid use is Captain America. "
