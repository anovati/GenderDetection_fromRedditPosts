Thrilling1031,news,1389382234.0,"Sorry to jack this comment but I'm sitting at a resort off international drive in Orlando right now and if you dial 911 from any phone you will get the police. Our phone system is designed to always assume that's what you meant. 

9 is the extension to dial out, but if you dial 9911 you still get 911.

7 is the extension to dial other rooms, but if you dial 7911 you still get the police.

I can't say for sure on this one because I've never done it but I think if you dial 1911 you would get the police as well. 

Modern phone systems coordinating 1000+ room hotels have to be smart. If the hotel is small It might not have this in place but I think having 911 reach the police is required any way, at least it should be."

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1389382242.0,"It's probably useful to think about towns as well as villages. In England a town was defined as having a market. Market towns (and towns where there used to be a market) are quite close: perhaps 5-8 miles apart would be a reasonable estimate, so getting to a market and back again once a week is an easy walk. These had a social function as well as a commercial one. Of course not everyone would visit the market, but they were known as a means for meeting someone outside your village. 

One obvious question is how well this worked in the most dispersed areas.  I come from Barnard Castle in Teesdale. Teesdale is one of the least populated areas in England, but it had two market towns (Barnard Castle, and Middleton-in-Teesdale) and from what I've read of local history, these were ""in range"" of most of the population - in fact distance from the towns (and the churches in the towns) was a limit on populating the upper dale for a while."

Allow me to clarify ""Slider"" a little bit more.

To me, personally, there are 3 different general classifications you can describe a dump with. These are tier 1 classifications, because they are the least descriptive, but still give a general idea and clear mental image.

1.) Slider - this is a piece of poop that slides into the hole of the toilet, making it almost invisible. Usually the tail peeks out from the hole.

2.) Floater - this is the type of log that floats around in the water after you release it.

3.) Chud - this is the massive and meaty dump that usually has more girth than length. The easiest way to tell if it is a true Chud is to attempt to flush it. If it does not flush, even when holding the handle for at least (10) ten seconds, it is a true Chud.

Look, I appreciate that we're getting the word out about a game, but a post would be sufficient. As for Sticky Threads, why not sticky a weekly question thread, or a list of important academic events coming up? You could even sticky a post about how Reddit's co-founder is coming up to UW and promote his book, since that is a relevant interest to everyone instead of a few. Otherwise, it should be reasonable that any and every club could have a weekly a sticky for recruitment or events.

I don't have kids, but having dated somebody who went to Nursing school and worked full time, I think my program makes up for it with being on-call late at night and the patient load. I get maybe one, two evenings a week where 8-11 pm I am SORTA free. 

I get it. You are tired. You want to veg and maybe doing something enjoyable. But your husband doesn't get to see you, and is probably shouldering a big part of child-care, and all he really wants is to have some intimate time with you. Maybe the problem is that you and him consider intimacy differently? For most of the guys I know, intimacy is sex. All that romantic stuff and dinner and such is nice but... they don't feel like they are being intimate unless they get sex. It sounds like you basically want to cut him off for the foreseeable future (maybe I'm reading it wrong?), and he is reacting just like you would if he said ""Sorry OP, but I'm just really stressed. So I'm gonna stop making dinner and cleaning around the house and listening to you gripe about school and the kids for the foreseeable future. No more texting. Don't cuddle with me, I don't like it. Also, if you argue with me about that... you are a selfish b****.""

I know it sounds stupid, but you should schedule it. Tell him, ""Hey, I am really really busy so much of the time. I want to make sure that you are happy and fulfilled in this relationship, and I understand that sex is a big part of it for you. Unfortunately, I just don't feel like sexytimes when I'm stressed and busy. Can we work something out?"" See what he says about that, rather than what he says when you just turn him down over and over. If he is still a jerk... well. You are with-holding sex. Try having sex with him, and then having the conversation when he can rationally think about it. Suggest that he wait up for you to finish studying if that is the only time you have. Weekend mornings send the kids somewhere. This isn't about him just getting off, this is about him feeling like you love him, and care about him and his needs. Porn doesn't fill that need for most people. He said it himself. He WANTS you. 

And if you do create a schedule, STICK TO IT. It will give him something to look forward to (""Yay Friday nights!""), and he will feel like you are making time for him and thinking of his needs, which honestly... might be most of the battle. "

Andrew9623,AskReddit,1389382437.0,"There was a theory I heard about a while back. It goes something like this:

Thirty years or so from now climate change will have caused major droughts in central america. Due to this many people flee north. Many of these people will immigrate to the united states. Since America will be having its own drought issues it will attempt to stop the mass influx of immigrants. They'll arm the border. 15 foot high walls, snipers, trenches, land mines. Due to the mass influx of mexicans there will be quite the latino population in the USA. Once they see what is happening to their fellow mexicans at the border they won't be happy. Perhaps this could cause civil war? "

Then, you get the organization of hangers, but it's much gentler on the clothes. My favorite hangers to use for this kind of thing are the Huggable Hangers at Target - they're not too bulky and the clothes stay on the hanger.

On the other side of that coin, I regularly hear things like ""Wow, how do you get that fat?"" or ""If she lost some weight, she'd really be attractive."" Skinny girls want curves because the media tells them that's what they want, so instead of making that lifestyle change or accepting who they are, they'll shame the overweight girls. 

This is coming from a girl who has been underweight her whole life, despite eating what I want whenever I want. I'm incredibly thankful for my metabolism, because it's not going be this high forever. However, it's really hurtful when someone says to ""Eat a couple cheeseburgers every now and then."" Just because you're struggling with body image doesn't give you the right to hurt mine.

And that's just fine. You like what you like. All I was saying before is that it sounded like you had an interest in certain sex acts, but couldn't get past the thought of them being somehow ""misogynist"". To me, that came across as hilarious, that you couldn't bring yourself to do something that you wanted to do, because you were worried about what your women's studies prof might think of you. Apologies if I misinterpreted you and that if you're not interested in such things. But if you weren't interested, then why even ask the question? 

&gt;Things like violent throat fucking - that's for women who enjoy being degraded (which is totally fine because some people are aroused by that).    You are implying that women should enjoy being degraded and and i dont think that's true - everyone likes something different - some like it while others dont.

What made you think that I believe that women, in general, should enjoy being degraded? I don't actually believe that, and if you're reading that into what I said, you might be reading that incorrectly into what other people say. Something to ponder in your spare time. 

&gt;I dont think that wanting to be respected as an equal, even when and if I submit to my boyfriend in the bedroom, is a 'feminist angle' - i dont think it is too much to ask for to be treated like a human being.

Wait, what? Isn't that precisely what feminism is about: equality and respect? 

&gt;I dont know if it turns me on to be submissive as I dont entirely know what it entails.  

Well, there is no one size fits all of BDSM. It's what the individual participants make of it, exchanging power within respected limits. I could tell you what I'm in to, but that's really not so important. Instead, as your boyfriend what *he's* in to. I hope, for your sake, it isn't ""violent throat fucking""! :-) 

For what it's worth, in all of the BDSM that I've ever been a part of, or seen first hand at play parties, I don't think I've ever seen a porno-style violent throat fucking. "

http://www.cfiresim.com/input.php?id=2253 - This is an example I made for you.  

Assuming:

* Work for 30 years (retirement is set at 2044)
* Portfolio starts at 0
* Basic 75/25 stock/bond allocation, with fairly low fees
* You invest $10,000/yr, and increase that amount with inflation. 

Out of 113 different 30-year periods that it looked at, your average portfolio for retirement would be $817,925.25 (in today's dollars).

You can flip this around, start a new simulation, and tell it your spending to see if it would last in retirement as you withdraw it. You can also add it all sorts of other details (estimated SS, any pensions you might get, extra savings, one-time or recurring spending events in the future, etc).

leaderelrond,AskReddit,1389382648.0,"When I was just a young kid, I was always a christian, proud to shout it from the rooftops, forced my mom to church every Sunday I wasn't at my dad's, and LOVED church.

Fast forward to the early years of teendom (11-15) when I want to just isolate myself in my room and I am a proud Atheist, and think all religions are stupid as hell.

At about 15, I declared being nothing, and knowing nothing. I wanted nothing to do with religions.

All this while, Norse mythology has ALWAYS been a huge interest to me, having Norwegian roots and what not. Well, about a year ago when I was 18, I started reading into Wicca. Since then I've become a pretty devoutish Wiccan, and love it. It's a more spiritual thing than an actual religion, and you can customize it so it fits you perfectly, and just because you tweak it, it isn't wrong.

Plus it fits all the views I had when I was younger, like when I was 6 and explaining reincarnation to my mom without even hearing about it before."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389382655.0,"You've actually expressed the idea several times in these threads.  Everytime you question why there are gender roles, you are questioning why there are men.

The push to make gender roles meaningless, to break down all barriers and allow women into every aspect of men's world, is a push to eradicate men.  If everyone is equal, if there are no differences between men and women, then...there is still a difference.  Because no amount of social planning, no amount of social engineering, no laws and no institutions, will ever give men equality with women when it comes to creating life.*  If you remove all gender roles, then the only difference between men and women is that men can't give birth.  Which means the only difference between men and woman is that men are failed women.

When I say ""eradicate men,"" I don't mean ""eradicate the male gender,""  I don't mean ""get rid of everyone with a penis.""  I mean making men and women the same.  I mean a world where boys never become anything more than boys.

*Possibly technology could be developed that would make it possible free women from childbearing, like an artificial womb, and then gender roles could really be made to disappear, but I'd argue that we would no longer be human beings at that point.

mkvgtired,business,1389382690.0,"A lot of people in that area make far less than that. I took a motorbike trip through a part of Vietnam very close to there. A $130 per month job would be a life saver for a lot of people there. 

$130 per month wont buy the life of a low-income American, but most people in Vietnam dont have that lifestyle. The average income in Vietnam [is only $185 per month](http://www.thanhniennews.com/index/pages/20120125-salaries-rise-in-vietnam-income-gap-still-wide.aspx), so given that, this is not all that absurd. The finance and insurance industry had the highest average income, and that comes in at only $264 per month. 

Without getting into it too much, Vietnam has a very corrupt system that allows party members to buy huge swaths of land through state owned banks at below market rates. They then lease it back to farmers at a rate that barely allows subsistence. This is the life many Vietnamese live, and I would bet the vast majority make far less than $90 per month, while these unofficial ""lords"" live the high life in huge houses and with multiple cars. I would bet most of these farmers would rather work at the factory for those wages. 

People always talk about foreign corporations exploiting people, but they never look at how much more exploited they often are by their own governments. Whether a vastly improved condition that might still be exploitive is better or not is subjective. What is pretty apparent, many of these factory jobs are better than the alternative, substance farming. This is evidenced by the fact many people chose to do them over subsistence farming. 

These numbers seem awful out of context, but given their context these factory workers are probably far better off than working the rice fields."

But that riff makes up like 3% of the song in Echos and 15% of the song in the Phantom of the Opera song (ballpark haha). So while Andrew Lloyd-Weber probably stole that one riff, that doesn't mean they are EXACTLY THE SAME song. 

This Train song, literally the entire verse and prechorus of the song, including the melody, harmonic pattern, rhythm, and chordal motion is EXACTLY the same.

Now I know plenty of music takes elements from other songs. That's important, even good; it allows for music to cross-pollinate and overlap, and allows musical concepts to bleed throughout various genres and time periods.

einTier,cars,1389383198.0,"Ha.  Not even close.  First, your BRZ weighs 2800 pounds on the high end while the ZL1 weighs 4120.  That makes a significant difference on tire wear, as it takes more ""stick"" to make that extra 47% weight change direction -- be it acceleration, deceleration, or going around a corner.  It's also got 580 HP and 556 ft-lbs of torque compared to your respective 200 and 151 numbers -- nearly *three times* the power and over 3.5 times the torque.   

It's going to wear tires faster than your BRZ just by its very nature.  But let's look at those tires, shall we? 

Your BRZ comes with [Michelin Primacy HPs](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Michelin&amp;tireModel=Primacy+HP&amp;partnum=145WR7PHP&amp;vehicleSearch=true&amp;fromCompare1=yes&amp;autoMake=Subaru&amp;autoYear=2013&amp;autoModel=BRZ&amp;autoModClar=Limited).  It's not a *bad* tire, but it is a grand touring summer tire.  It's designed more for ride comfort than pure stick. 

The ZL1 comes with [Goodyear Eagle F1 Supercar G2s](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Goodyear&amp;tireModel=Eagle+F1+Supercar+G%3A+2&amp;frontTire=835YR0F1G2LV2&amp;rearTire=035YR0F1G2L&amp;frontLeftTire=835YR0F1G2RV2&amp;rearLeftTire=035YR0F1G2R&amp;vehicleSearch=true&amp;fromCompare1=yes&amp;autoMake=Chevrolet&amp;autoYear=2012&amp;autoModel=Camaro%20ZL1&amp;autoModClar=Coupe).  This is a very, very high performance tire that's probably sticky enough to qualify as an r-compound race tire 10 years ago.  You'll also notice the tread depth is 20% less than the tread depth on your Michelins, which means even if everything else were equal, you're only going to get 80% of the life. 

But it's not.  The UTQG is pretty much bullshit and you can't compare manufacturer to manufacturer, but there is direct relationship to stickiness of the tire and tread life.  If the tire is super sticky, every time it rolls over a piece of pavement, more of that tire is going to be left behind.  There's just no way to make a very sticky tire that lasts a long time.  With tires like these, you'll be lucky to get to 10,000 miles and I've seen tires like this go in less than 8,000 if the car has track time mixed in.  I've personally burned through a similar set of tires in just a few thousand miles of nearly exclusive track work.

winkers,loseit,1389383211.0,"It's easy for me to say this because I know how much we all want to *look* and feel good but.... try focusing on how you feel with... your clothes off.

I know. Weird, right?  Compared to a year ago, I am more limber and am able to take deep breaths without straining.  I was 40lb heavier.  I can bike and walk effortlessly now for an hour, which is a huge improvement from being a couch potato.

Still, like I mentioned, when I strap on some jeans or a belt I get down too sometimes.  I feel that bulge in my waist when I bend over.  I've even had a good female friend tell me that I'd be really hot if I lost the fat.  :-/

The other thing to know is that this is a temporary feeling for you.  We all go through it, not that it makes it easier to experience per se.  But we really all have those periods of sadness and since these changes take so much time (months... years?) sometimes we don't even register how much we've improved.

If you have to measure your progress then add more metrics like:

*  Are you able to accomplish your morning workouts well?
*  Do you feel okay/good/great on days that you've had your workout?
*  Can you see the little changes in your body?  When I lost weight, I saw my cheekbones for the first time in a decade.  I saw my jawline for the first time since I was a teen.

You don't know me but as an internet friend, I'm telling you that you're doing fine.  You are fine.  This weekend, call a friend maybe to do something active like go for a walk and get something to eat.  Make a couple of new changes in your routine or diet.

I know you don't 'feel the joy' when you are wearing certain clothes but I bet you anything that you fill out the clothes waaaay better now than you did in the past.

Have a good weekend!"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389383282.0,"&gt;this is why the insecurities, it felt like he might have chosen her if she wanted him.

He probably would have...at the time.  If he had the crush and found out she didn't feel the same, the feelings are still going to linger.  If you both simultaneously asked him out at that point, he would choose her because he was into her *at the time*.  Once he got to know you, he lost interest in her and realized you were way better, and he wanted you instead.  I remember at one point, I was into Rebecca, and I think it prevented me from realizing that Ashley was into me the whole time.  I asked Rebecca out and was turned down, but I couldn't help the feelings that I still had for her.  Then Ashley and I hung out, and not only did I realize that she was interested, but so was I (and holy crap, was I!).  I was *far* more into Ashley than I was Rebecca, I mean, no competition at all.  If Rebecca suddenly came into the picture, I would have said too bad!

&gt;If I've felt attracted to someone the feeling never went away (maybe I got to know them better and saw that we wouldn't be happy together but the chemistry was still there and it never appeared after awhile if it wasn't there in the beginning).

You have it backwards - I'm not talking about feelings for someone that went away, I'm talking about feelings that weren't there at first but eventually developed.  The point being that he may not have had feelings for you immediately, but he developed them as he got to know you better.  That's a good thing!  That means the more he learned about you, the happier he got and the more he realized he wanted to be with you.

&gt;I really don't want to become that paranoid girl but don't want to lie to myself either.

You don't have to do either.  Realize that you're insecure, find out *why*, and then figure out how to change it.  For example, a long time ago, I used to care if my SO hung out with other guys because it would make me worried, jealous, whatever.  Then I realized it was just insecurity, because she wanted to be with *me*.  Guys are people, too, so why can't she hang out with other guys?  What's wrong with that?  Absolutely nothing.  If I trust her, there's no reason to worry.  If I don't trust her, and there *is* reason to worry, then I shouldn't be with her.  This applies to really anything that you want to change about yourself because you don't like it.  Realize what you think needs to change, and then make the change.  Also, understand it's probably not going to happen overnight.  You may feel a little insecure for a while, just keep telling yourself that everything is okay.  Eventually, it will flicker out and go away, and then you won't have to worry about it anymore.

If it's the stressful situation, then take a second to gather your thoughts as suggested in this thread. 


If it's people you are not close with, then you need to ""fake it until you made it.""  Speak your mind. Concentrate more on getting your point across and less on how your peers will react to what you have to say.  People will make judgements regardless, and you will empower yourself when you are not hung up on their impression of you.  That's not to say you should ignore others opinions, but rather not hinge your self confidence and self worth  on their validation (or lack thereof). 


Confidence is not even a prerequisite to be dominant; sometimes a overbearing and condescending personality stems from deep seeded insecurity. A truly confident person chooses when to be dominant, and chooses when to be submissive.

phomaniac,AskMen,1389383324.0,"This can go either way in my opinion. One of the best parts of the wedding is that special feeling the groom gets when he see's the bride for the first time in that dress. Having not been there, I can only imagine... But she should be the most beautiful she's ever been when in that dress... At least that's the feeling I've gotten at other people's weddings... Wow, so and so looks like WOW in that dress...

But that's just the romantic speaking...

The logical answer is that it's a big purchase and so both parties should be in on the decision making process. "

You know...a lot of people complain about the emphasis that is put on female ""niceness"" from a young age, and that women are socialized to prioritize other people's comfort over their own.  While it sucks to feel like you have to be sweet and gentle all the time, being ""nice"" and putting people at ease is a valuable social skill for both genders.

Illivah,dwarffortress,1389383462.0,"The default max population is 200, so I consider that large. You have about 150 more dwarves than you need in order to do basically everything available in the game, so that's ~ 150 jobs that you really just gotta make up for the sake of keeping dwarves busy, happy, and away from tantrums.

As for the technical limits of my machine, that can happen at any fort of any size, depending on what's going on. I try not to use utilities or cheaty-feeling hacks ot increase FPS, and when I do I usually just leave the fort shortly thereafter. My first trully successful fort was ~ 250 dwarves, for full squads of legendary (danger-room trained) melee dwarves in full steel, with some deep digging, semi-complex internals (my favorite part was the in-room wells we had) and no mods at all. I was getting around 10 fps. Until my most recent fort I haven't tried to get there again, as I became really bored. But I felt it was still completely manageable. 

What helps with management is getting rid of all reasons to micromanage. Military was already on patrols and training full time that needed almost no supervision. Food jobs were on repeat, but just in case I also occasionally added a few hundred brewing and cooking jobs just in case. Hauling routes are almost all minecarted now, though with that many spare dwarves there isn't a real good reason to. Happiness is automatic with that much wealth. Managers make micromanaging a rare event, and in the end the biggest problems I had were dealing with the occasional impossible noble request. A large justice system helped, and if I really needed to I always had a problem-releaving lever for such nobles."

Hilanderiam,bodyweightfitness,1389383688.0,"Now here's the hard fact. This is going to take you a couple of years. Even if you manage to bulk up at a rate of 1lbs per week (muscle &amp; fat gains), to reach 190 lbs is going to take you ~65 weeks (assuming your target weight is 180 lbs). But I doubt you wish to gain 20-30lbs of fat, so a more realistic time frame is somewhere around 2 years, with mostly muscle gains and a little fat as well. You might deem fat gains as bad but in the context of bulking up fat gains are beneficial as long as those fat gains aren't all fat gains (=indication that you're eating at a surplus to maximize potential muscle gains).  


What you need to focus on is legs, back, core, the ones you picked; ie. everything. Why, well to be honest you don't have much and you'll need as much of everything you can get (big muscles --&gt; most potential for gains). Not to mention that a strength imbalance will lead to injures (the smaller supporting muscles must keep up with the heavy movers).  
   
 
First you should start eating, eating and then eat some more until you start seeing substantial gains. Eat a little more and bulk up as you go and start with light training. You can cut that excess fat away later on once you've reached 10-15lbs over your target weight.  
Secondly you should focus on building strength, 5x3 on the easiest routines and then build from that (go easy and let your body get used to being punished on a regular basis). If you wish to use your own free weights, then don't go nuts with tons of reps, keep them at 5-8 reps &amp; 3 sets or you'll run the risk of getting injured or massive soreness or worse. Also you're going to need heavier weights very soon. You need to build up not just muscles but tendons, joints, bone strengths as well, and this takes time. Again eating and eating helps in this regard as well.  
Third: Add some light cardio to that as well, 30 min walks, easy jogging for a mile or two, 30 min cycling or something that you enjoy doing several times a week. Just start moving those legs and arms and get that blood flowing through your veins.  

ps. You'll get a six pack after bulking up and making a hard cut AFTER bulking up over your goal weight. Meanwhile that sixpack will be hidden beneath a layer of belly fat.  
pps. There are no short cuts. Just hard work, dedication and time."

danshaffer96,AskReddit,1389383730.0,"Hello, Catholic here, and I'd like to help you understand the way at least one sect of Christianity views it. There's very few parts of the Bible that are just blatantly ignored by people today. Basically, anything about morals or philosophy is still startlingly relevant to us today.

The ""ignored"" things, are rules in the Old Testament such as not eating shellfish, not wearing mixed fabrics, etc. These books were written for Jews in exile in Babylon. They had begun assimilating into Babylonian culture, losing aspects of their old faith. The rules were put in Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy so that ""new"" Jews would have a set of rules to reference to, to know that they were practicing correctly.

The reason Christians don't see it necessary to follow those rules is that they stem from the covenant Moses made on Mount Sinai. This is where God declared the Jews to be his people, and the Jews declared God to be their god. In the New Testament, at the Last Supper, Jesus creates a new covenant, opening the doors to all people, not only Jews.

Arrive at bolts at the top of a climb.

Clip my PAS to a bolt with a locking carabiner.  Use a quickdraw to connect another loop of my PAS to the other bolt to create redundancy.

Call off-belay, untie, feed rope through chains.

Put ATC on the longest section of the PAS (I prefer to extend my rappels like in the graphic). Set up ATC on the rope.

Install a prusik on the rope BELOW the ATC, attached to my leg loop with a locking carabiner. This makes it easy to release the prusik if it is engaged, uses the mechanical advantage of the ATC to stop a fall, and makes it almost impossible for your prusik to fail by getting stuck on the ATC as long as you use a short enough cord loop.

""hop"" up the rope and fully weight my rappel system to ensure all is working properly.

One last visual check of my system, call ""on rappel"", detach my PAS from the anchors and begin my rappel."

tomfishtheGR8,AskReddit,1389383853.0,"I agree with you, but I'ld like to offer a slightly different perspective on the meaning/purpose/faith dynamic. 


My dad is an environmentalist who has worked for The US Forest Service, The Fish and Wildlife Service, and the World Wildlife Fund. He's done research all over the world, but is based out of Alaska. When I talk to him, I like to ask him about his work, and he tells me details of some of the studies he's involved with.


Anyway, he was telling me about how all coral reefs are projected to go extinct within the next 30 years, do to changing ocean temperatures and salinity levels. Even a few degrees difference can kill off reefs, because they evolved to survive in an extremely narrow window of parameters. This is not something we can stop, or undo (barring technology that hasn't been invented yet) because the C02 is already in the atmosphere, it will just take a while to warm up (as heat is trapped over a period of time). 


For some reason this particular news plunged me into a deep existential funk. I wondered why I should buy into a system (i.e. college, work, career, family within a capitalist consumer driven society) that is driving such a terrible mass extinction event. Even if I succeeded as an individual, as a whole, the system was obviously not sustainable.


What I lacked was faith. I couldn't fathom there could be a reason that humans would be allowed to kill off the world around them, the world that had given birth to them. 


Having been raised around scientists, I turned to observable phenomenon in nature to answer this question. I looked at the life cycle of a single individual, and the the cells that make the individual up. Individuals are born, reproduce, get sick and die. The fact that they die, does not negate the important fact that they were once alive if they can reproduce and pass the information they learned on to the next generation. 

However, as you watch a seed grow into a tree, or a baby grow up, nowhere along the way did those individual cells get together and discuss their plans for the future (i.e. lets get really big and reproduce). It just happened because they worked together and carried out their own small rolls within the system. 

You apply this analogy on any scale you want. Whether or not there is a big master plan in play, or a natural cycle to which we are observing an infinitesimally small slice, THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN COMPREHEND THE END GOAL AND OUR RESPECTIVE FUNCTION ON AN INDIVIDUAL (CELLULAR) LEVEL. 

As such, we must orient ourselves based on the information we do have, try to make the right choices, and live a full and complete life, all while keeping our minds open. This can mean organized religion, atheism, agnosticism, whatever. The answers (and questions for that matter) can be different for everyone, because in themselves none are really better than others. 


What really matters if faith--that if we are constantly trying to better ourselves and make a positive difference in the lives of those around us, we don't need to worry what the point of it all is. This is how I did away with my existential anxiety, and even though I look to science, this basic message is central tenant to many religions. 


This is my point of view, but I actually really hope people question it. Anyone who claims to have all the answers is full of shit. "

Mzsickness,funny,1389384048.0,"It's more challenging for newer people. When you first start engineering in the US we learn both and it's pretty hard to get a judge of estimation of 150 kWatts versus horsepower.

However, once you routinely switch back and forth and see different measurements in the physical sense, like watching a 10 bar steam valve release pressure versus watching a 1000 kpa steam valve release pressure (they're identical). 

So after you get a good feeling and expertise down it's really simple.

The background knowledge is really important.

Because our design plans list streams in mixed units sometimes. It might be imperial and metric on the same stream. So if you're used to both systems expertly you can judge properties of the streams quicker.

So I can determine easily how many BTUs can come out of a condensing steam pipe based on the kg/s at 10 bars of pressure and temperature in Kelvin.

Otherwise EU engineers would have to convert units to determine outputs and we're able to get an accurate estimate of the product stream quicker.

As well as being able to know how much power/energy comes out. Someone not well versed in BTUs wouldn't be able to determine if 40,000 btu/hr is a lot for a super heated steam stream. Unless they do trial and error over their period of course-work/career to build up a general understanding of what's large or small.

It's all a matter of context really.

Also, a lot of people think the US system is idiotic and stupid. Which it is in some stand points--however the Imperial system is based around humans rather around even numbering systems.

And in the end all measurement systems are created from arbitrary points. Metric was around water/Earth and Imperial was around human lifestyle and business practices."

And I could say the same thing for theories that tend to stray more towards the dualist realm.

[Emergent properties of consciousness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergentism) do attempt to address the idea of consciousness through a physicalist prospective. It certainly is a tough cookie to tackle, and I'm not suggesting that they have the answer yet, but when you say that there is no way to explain it yet it seems like an ""God of the gaps"" excuse.

I wouldn't say completely side-steps is an accurate description of it. There just simply isn't any evidence to definitely support any claims yet. That doesn't mean that we should just accept any theory that seems plausible.

The body looks at muscle as an expensive upkeep and much rather burn that than waste fat which has no upkeep. 

The closest you can get to that physique is by competitively swimming, but those guys are on a different system. Due to the mass amount of exercise (hours a day) they are able required to eat over 10k calories a day much like humans ate 500 years ago. This prevents the body from going catabolic, but even then, it's hard to get that Zyzz physique. That physique is all tren, deca, and test. "

""What movie did I throw on before every trip to the mountain? “The Community Project.” Yes, “The Art of Flight” is out of this world and yes “That’s It That’s All” was one of the most groundbreaking movies to ever hit the snowboard world. But what came right before that? “The Community Project.” It gave us a sneak peak as to what was to come from the brainchild of Travis Rice. So If I had to pick one movie that forever changed my view on snowboarding, this would be it. It made snowboarding attainable for us Joes out there rather than inspirational to the point that made you never strap on a snowboard again.

Peko is grossly underrated IMO but he was the guy who held the defensive line together once Geno went down simply because he's such a presence that trying to double his replacements (DEs we kicked inside or our second year guys, who god love them they tried) wasn't an option because Peko would close the back  end of the line so quick.  Burfict is just a special guy who did more than I would ever ask of a LB.  He could go anywhere and smack around anyone who was in his area, which is roughly a little over half of the field.  Atkins is a fantastic player who is in a great position to kick all kinds of ass and make our defense truly monstrous, but without the other two, I don't think we would have made the playoffs.

ibbity,AskWomen,1389384302.0,"No, the same thing would not happen anywhere you go. You admit yourself that you know no culture except your own, that you've never been outside your country. how the hell would you know ANYTHING about what other countries are like? You wouldn't, and you can't assume that everywhere is identical to where you live, because it is not. 

So if no one cares about how people run their relationships, why are you so hung up on your fear of not being able to run a relationship the ""right"" way? Also, the idea that girls only want a ""bad boy' and don't want a pleasant person who won't try to boss them around and take the reins is a lie. A certain type of girl likes that kind of guy. Other types of girls do not. Do you spend a lot of time socializing with women, or do you mostly spend your time with other guys? You might be seeing lots of the bad-boy chasers because that is what you are LOOKING for---confirmation bias. 

There's nothing ridiculous or shameful about not being a dominant man who bosses his woman around. Some women like that. Some women don't. Even in your culture, there are very likely some women who would be perfectly fine with a guy who isn't all about ruling over them. You're very young and you are probably spending most of your time with your peers at the moment---this tells me that you are likely absorbing a lot of the macho-man attitude that tends to crop up in young men who are on their own for the first time. That does not define how adults should live their lives. It only defines the insecurity of young men who are trying to figure out what it means to be independent."

Being alone, battles of self-worth, never finding another to love me.... plus Oh GOD, if I wasn't good enough to make it work with X, Y and Z might want to leave me too! And then I'd be REALLY ALONE! FOREVER!

The reality of the situation might be that that we are safe and happy and loved in other relationships - but the feelings during a breakup are not conducive to keeping that in mind.

I do agree that regardless of the situation, one is not better or worse than the other - both situations are painful - but I actually know that I and many other poly folk experience all those mono-breakup feels in addition to some very poly-specific concerns and feels.

In any case, though I disagree, that does shed some light into how some folks might be thinking about it - so thanks for that!"

kratosgranola,asktrees,1389384427.0,"Very specific questions! I'm gonna answer them all but a lot of the specifics you're asking about will probably have to be answered with just speculations; you don't really see people measure the volume of their bowls.

&gt;What is the normal process for packing a bowl? From my limited knowledge, you pack the smaller pieces (kief?) in first and then put the larger parts on top and start burning from the top?

Actually, I typically put the slightly bigger pieces in first and sprinkle the finer pieces on top. Kief is used for special occasions or when I'm running dry, but almost always goes on top. Small pieces on the bottom means some will fall through the hole.

&gt;What is the typical composition of a bowl? (%small/medium/large/other) Percents would be immensely helpful here.

I never pay super close attention because it really doesn't matter that much, but maybe 25% big, ~50% medium, ~25% small?

&gt;On average, how much material goes into a bowl? (a gram or so? What's the volume roughly?)

If your bowl fits a gram you have an impressive bowl. I'd say a decent sized bowl for 2 people would be maybe .5-.7g, never really measured though plus it's different for everyone. My bowl probably fits a solid .8-.9g, and it's bigger than most of my friend's. If I had to give a volume, then 1cm^3 is probably a close number, maybe more like 1.2?

&gt;What are the typical sizes of the bowls themselves?
I'd say an average spoon bowl is 3-5 inches long(mine's ~ 4.5), but they can get really big and unique.

&gt;Is tightness of the product against the walls of the bowl of vital importance to the smoking process?

Yes. If you pack everything down too tight, you won't have airflow and you'll have a hard time lighting/burning. If you don't pack down at all, you'll burn the weed much faster. this isn't necessarily bad, but you can fit more in the bowl and make it burn smoother by putting more in and packing it down. There's no number for the perfect amount of pressure to apply, you just get a feel for it.

&gt;Are there legal substitutes that has similar physical characteristics to Marijuana in everyday form? (density, compactness, stickiness, etc. I'm guessing wet sand? This will be important for prototyping)

I could see wet sand working sorta well, but honestly I've never tried packing anything legal into my bowl so I don't really know. My best guess would be to use some other herb like oregano(ground down a bit if needed), since it's still plant matter.

&gt;Will a trombone mouthpiece be a fair representation of the bowl with a bit of downstem or will I need to go out and find a substitute or an actual accessory piece? (Not so sure what the laws are on possession of accessories here without product but likely illegal)

hahaha, a brass mouthpiece is actually a pretty accurate bong slide replica in terms of it's shape. It's probably a decent substitute for an actual bowl if you're okay doing that to your mouthpiece, but the hole at the bottom will be bigger than with a slide or pipe. (note: pipes and slides are sold as tobacco products so as long as the glass is clean it's still considered a tobacco product)

&gt;Are there any other minor annoyances about usage or maintenance that I could fix for you? If so, please provide some more details about those so I can come up with a few ideas for it.

One minor annoyance is the whole ""packing too tight"" thing. I'd love to be able to pack my bowl super tight(to fit more) and not have to worry about not having enough airflow. there's definitely more little things like that but I can't think of them right now. Feel free to inquire further if I missed something or got you thinking, and I hope this helps!"

In a rare interview, Metje Blaak, herself a former prostitute and heading the information centre, The Red Thread (in dutch De Rode Draad), bemoans the lot of prostitution in these current times. She complains that there are indeed big problems with the government. “There are too many rules, I feel that there is coming a time when it will be illegal to solicit a prostitute, we are heading in that direction,” she says when I ask her about the challenges with the Amsterdam City Council.

 “Legislation was a great idea for the girls, they are free to work, but there are challenges with the rules, there are too many rules; rules about registration, about taxes. There is a lot of regulation and the girls are going out of business.”

Nemesis0320,AskMen,1389384595.0,"This was back in the final weeks of Sophomore year in High school.  I had just broken up with my girlfriend and was in a hormone-driven state of feeling depressed and alone.  The ex and I almost exclusively shared our friend base, so I was feeling like I had nobody I could hang out with without the breakup coming up.

In comes one of my classmates.  We sat next to each other in a few of my AP classes out of coincidence, but we never really talked about anything outside of class material.  Her ex boyfriend and I used to be really good friends my freshman year, when he was a Junior.  We had a falling out and she stayed off my radar.  Anyways, one day she says she needs a ride home and doesn't want to ask somebody who would be making a trip out of it.  Her neighborhood was on the way to where I live, so I said sure.  As we get ready to leave the student parking, she starts throwing out all these suggestions.  ""I'm hungry.  Let's get something to eat.""  So we do.  It's pretty standard 'oblivious guy' from there.  Laughing at everything I say, playful attitude, and there I am trying to awkwardly eat my meal with this little 5'4"" girl trying to out-perform local diner toast.  To be fair, it was an amazing piece of toast.  Afterwards, she suggests we hit a movie.  We do.  The entire time she keeps on complaining about how boring the movie was, and keeps on trying to get my attention.  She keeps grabbing my thigh.  I think she is reaching for me to move over more.  I remember thinking that.  ""She already has the armrest, I can't give her much more room then that."" Movie finishes, I take her home.  ""Did you want to stay over for a bit? I don't have anything going on.""  I smile back.  ""Nah, I think I'm going to head back home.  I'm a little tired.""

kempff,Catholicism,1389384614.0,"I started with Ignatius' letter to Polycarp.

I looked Ignatius up, and it turns out he and Polycarp were disciples of John; Ignatius was bishop of Antioch (where we were first called ""Christians"") while Polycarp was bishop of Smyrna.

Antioch is in south central Turkey near the border with Syria, and Smyrna is in western Turkey on the coast of the Aegean Sea across from Greece. Both towns still exist and have people living there plus a lot of interesting ruins from ancient times and have thriving tourist industries. There are tours where you can follow Paul's missionary journeys that include these and other places mentioned in Acts.

These letters from Ignatius were apparently written around 105-115, and John died around 90, so these letters are coming fifteen to twenty-five years after John died. Ignatius wrote them on his way to Rome to be eaten by lions during the halftime show in the Coliseum.

On the whole, in the letter to Polycarp, Ignatius is pretty much saying all the same things Paul said to Timothy and Titus about how to be a bishop.

At one point in the letter Ignatius talks about how to deal with people who have voluntarily given up marriage.

""If any one can continue in a state of purity, to the honour of Him who is Lord of the flesh, let him so remain without boasting. If he begins to boast, he is undone; and if he reckon himself greater than the bishop, he is ruined.""

In other words, those who have given up marriage have the tendency to think themselves better than those who have not, out of spiritual pride.

I think there is a lot of truth to this. As a Catholic I acknowledge the single state - or rather the celibate state, where you make an explicit vow to forgo marriage - to be better in and of itself than marriage, but ... the taller they are, the harder they fall, right?"

kempff,Catholicism,1389384634.0,"Ignatius' letter to the Christian community of Smyrna (of which Polycarp was bishop) has a few gems useful for apologetics.

&gt; ""For I have observed that ye are perfected in an immoveable faith, as if ye were nailed to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in the flesh and in the spirit, and are established in love through the blood of Christ, being fully persuaded with respect to our Lord, that He was truly of the seed of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God according to the will and power of God; that He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled by Him; and was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed[to the cross] for us in His flesh. Of this fruit we are by His divinely-blessed passion, that He might set up a standard for all ages, through His resurrection, to all His holy and faithful[followers], whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church""

Anyone who has read the New Testament can see the verbal parallels in what Ignatius has written here. This proves that much of the NT was already written and circulated as early as the lifetime of Ignatius, and not, as some have said, forged in the names of the apostles decades later.

*  ""Nailed to the cross"" proves that the details of how a crucifixion was carried out were common knowledge, and that it was not simply tying someone's wrists to a post or a crossbar with rope, as some say.
*  ""Truly the seed of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God according to the will and power of God"" proves either Ignatius read Romans and therefore Romans was already published, or that the phrase was already a common-knowledge saying among Christians by then and therefore an integral part of the gospel message.
*  But the existence of stereotyped sayings among Christians is the beginning of creeds, and therefore people who don't like the idea of statements of faith written by men are not in step with historic Christianity - and of course I am saying this as a Catholic for whom creeds written by men are essential and indispensable tools for giving a definite account of what I believe.
*  ""That He was truly born of a virgin, was baptized by John, in order that all righteousness might be fulfilled by Him"" - the virgin birth is an essential part of the gospel message, as well as his baptism by John the Baptist where Heaven vouched for him, but also that the Gospel of Matthew was already published by Ignatius' time (because it echoes the wording of Matthew 3:15).
* ""And was truly, under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch, nailed [to the cross] for us in His flesh"" - in other words, he was not crucified ""spiritually"" or ""symbolically"" but literally, with actual nails, and Pilate and Herod were both directly responsible for this, at a certain time, in a a certain place, and again these facts were common knowledge. In other words, this is something that actually happened, and happened only one generation ago.
* We are as far removed from the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler as Ignatius was from the ministry of Jesus.
*   Investigating Jesus' ministry would be like interviewing a survivor of Pearl Harbor or the Holocaust.
*  Investigating Paul's ministry would be like interviewing people who knew John F Kennedy.
* Investigating Timothy or Titus' ministries would be like interviewing retired Lockheed, McDonnell-Douglas, or Boeing employees about the early Space Program.
*  And Ignatius is as far removed from the death of the apostle John as we are from the death of the muppetteer Jim Henson.
* ""Whether among Jews or Gentiles, in the one body of His Church"" - proof that 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, and Colossians were already published, in spite of theories to the contrary.

Right after this paragraph Ignatius says, ""He truly raised up Himself, not, as certain unbelievers maintain, that He only seemed to suffer"", because even that early on, there were New Agers saying it was all a sanitized illusion. Nope. Christianity is a gritty, sweaty, bloody, fleshy religion that actually happened. From now on you will notice the places in the Bible where it says Jesus got tired!

""And as they believe, so shall it happen unto them, when they shall be divested of their bodies, and be mere evil spirits."" - Ha! What a slam. This is like saying that after they die they will become less than nothing. But it must be borne in mind that these people taught that material things are evil and spiritual things are good; Ignatius is saying that even if they are freed from the evil of material existence, they will not become good spirits, but evil spirits, because they are already evil in this life.

The paragraphs that follow confirm that Jesus was no symbolic spirit-being, and the rest of the letter is basically a catalog of proofs that the New Agers are full of bunk, while also proving that the gospel accounts were already common knowledge.

Ignatius also mentions wild animals a couple of times, and this is ironic, because he was being brought to Rome to be executed by being eaten alive.

""For what does it profit, if any one commends me, but blasphemes my Lord, not owning Him to be God incarnate? He that does not confess this, has in fact altogether denied Him, being enveloped in death."" - That last phrase ""being enveloped in death"" in Ignatius' original Greek literally says, ""but he is a necrophore"", that is, a bearer of a dead body, as in a pall-bearer. But recall the opening words of this letter, ""Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus"", where the name (nickname) Theophorus literally means God-bearer. I think Ignatius is making a subtle joke about the difference between being a God-bearer and a corpse-bearer. Because if Jesus was definitely a real live human being as Ignatius keeps insisting on all throughout this letter, but you deny that Jesus was God incarnate, you might as well preach a dead Jesus. (Trivia: If necrophore means corpse-bearer and Theophorus means God-bearer, what does the name Christopher mean?)

The rest of the letter is an important witness to the existence of the threefold hierarchy that got established in Acts (bishop-presbyter-deacon) and of the centrality of the role of the bishop in the church community.

MrStonedOne,AskReddit,1389384723.0,"So, one day I'm working returns at home depot and our assistant district manager comes in to return something.

She lived near by and shopped at this store a lot.

Now, I was new to returns, so I assumed this was a test of some kind, and even if it wasn't, that she would mention anything I forgot to my boss, so I'm triple checking EVERYTHING.

Finally go to process the return, and the system says that everything she was returning had already been return, like 150 bucks worth of flooring stuff she ended up not needed.

""oh really? returned already? Is Scott in today?""

After confirming our head store manager was in, she steams off to his office telling me to hold her stuff, with me quickly calling him to let him know what was about to happen.

50 minutes go by and I'm just doing my thing, lunch break comes and goes, and as I walk back in, I see one of the night stock workers who xfered to cashiering recently, getting taken out in cuffs by the cops, crying up the biggest storm I have ever seen a grown man cry.

Turned out he would return anything bought with a debit card or cash (credit cards returned to the card, and gift cards returned to store credit.) by printing dupe receipts when he worked cashiering, and using them when he worked returns.

He got out with 5k of cash in a month, but was dumb enough to try this on the assistant district manager, (i doubt he knew who she was really)

ZippityZoppity,Psychonaut,1389384724.0,"&gt;You're conflating consciousness with a dualistic, libertarian conception of free will. Whether we have any personal or transcendent control over our actions/attention is a related debate, but no particular answer is necessary for a non-materialist view of consciousness.

Alright, but I would say that dualism is a necessary predicate for non-material consciousness, unless you have some more in depth reads into the matter.

I'm familiar with Chalmers, and if I remember correctly he's the one that identified the ""hard problem"" of consciousness. I will give your link a read sometime this weekend. I've always found him very articulate and precise with his words.

&gt;all of these are correlations between the brain and consciousness,

Sure, we don't have a direct causal link, but I don't think this means it's an unsolvable problem. Since we can manipulate consciousness, and we can make a person more or less conscious through physical means, I would say the evidence seems to sway more in favor of materialist explanations.

On top of this, we're getting very close to reproducing consciousness through digital mechanisms, which further seems to defeat the idea that consciousness is an immaterial thing."

Reagansmash1994,funny,1389384756.0,"The same would apply to you, if it's always the case then provide other examples rather than the clearly fake video I posted. The argument at this point is null and void.

Yeah, my mistake I was meant to say journalist but was thinking about something Scott Weinberg (critic) said. It was along the lines of, ""I think I have earned the right to be called a critic and not a blogger by now"" and your comment reminded me of that. But yes, my bad.

Also, no. Journalist isn't really a particular title, there are all sorts of fields that journalists can go into and they do not have the title, ""Journalist"". Similarly, you can become a Journalist without the degree. Simply by writing for you local news paper, one could call themselves a journalist. This is the point I am making, since I started the course lecturers told us to refer to ourselves as Journalists.

Firstly where the interview came from is a key factor and what it's for. There are many types of interviews where Interviewers intend to make the audience look stupid, to some degree. It's the context that is key. Also looking at the why, why is the interview taking place etc. There are all sorts of factors to take into account.

We could sit here going in circles all day. But there are many examples of interviewers who often paint the interviewee in a negative light. I can't grab any videos from memory (I am sure you'll use that to say I am wrong) but interviewers often shape their subject in a bad light, Lynn Barber is a fine example. She interviewed many people writing features that didn't show the subject in the best light. 

My point is that you can't simply say it's fake because you can't see the interviewer. I am trying to tell you, in the simplest terms, that there is more to it than that. It's flawed logic to rely simply on that fact as there are more prominent reasons why it is fake and that is not a full proof way of finding out if an interview is fake.

But I'll agree to disagree."

PunkinNickleSammich,AskReddit,1389384789.0,"I was very religious as a child. Up until I was about 17. I was on the youth ministry team for a while. At some point before high school graduation I started to lose my faith. I had a very hard time dealing with that because a part of me was furious with myself because it was wrong to deny the existence of God and another part of me was mad because it was all a fairytale. I was torn. This went on for about three years. I tormented myself over it. I come from a VERY religious family on all sides so I was also losing them, in a sense, and seeing them in a new light (which I didn't like). I have gone through many phases. Anger, resentment, arrogance... I think I am at a point of acceptance.  

I think religion can be a beautiful wonderful thing for some people. It CAN do a lot of good. It can also do quite a good bit of harm. In the end, I guess what we choose to believe and what we do with that belief is a reflection of our true selves no matter what our religion (or lack there of) is.

Anyway, science does for me what religion does for some others. It comforts me. It helps me understand myself, others and life in general. It's the past and the future. Religion in my eyes is a creation of man to explain the world and life and death. It is a man made comfort. "

funkymunniez,boston,1389384891.0,"To point 1:  even you pointing out bradys win% in the playoffs recently, what was his performance those years?  Two super bowl appearances something like 5 appearances in the afcc and two losses at the divisional round or wildcard.  If that's what you consider an average or not that great performance, fuck I'll take it every year even with the real possibility of one and done.

To point 2:  I did not say that eli Manning was better than Brady.  I stated that if you wanted to make the *argument* that he was a better *playoff performer * then the win % is probably the best place to start.  Not that he is better.

To point 3: while regular season performance gives context to playoff hopes, it has been historically poor at predicting success.  Manning is a hof qb.  No question.  In running for MVP almost every year, no question.  But he is one of the worst playoff performers in the league and that is backed up by his record post season.  When you have a single elimination format, your best measure at seeing who is good and who isn't really depends on their past appearances and their ability to lead their team deep into the playoffs.  Because flukey things do happen.  The pats probably shouldn't have lost to the jets a few years back, they could have won the 07 bowl 8 times out of 10 but they didn't.  So you look back at the trends and see where and how far they succeeded to.  In bradys case, he still success quite a damn bit over the past 6 playoff appearances and so does his team.  So again, looking at the trends of how far they get being led by a specific qb is probably the best placs to start on terms of saying who is the better of the remaining qbs.  Not taking one seasons context and disregarding all the others, even the most recent ones.  The fact is that Brady is still one of the better playoff performers still alive in the post season right now, and the context of a single season doesn't change that."

For actively developed systems and the components specific to it, they stay as projects, in fact, almost indefinitely. Mostly that's because I've worked in Agile shops, and when a change is required, that change usually propagates across all layers (new fields/objects/methods, etc). 

But, we do have some common components that all applications use. Those common components have their own solutions. Then, in an ideal world, you'd have a team examining each other project to see what additional cross-cutting features could be added to those common components. Those projects get referenced by DLL. 

Eventually, and maybe this is a pie-in-the-sky dream, I'd like to work in an environment where the data model and data access methods are all already laid out and pretty much static forevermore.

Now, ah, from time to *time*, the audience is disa^wheyvan -pointed with some of the other *smaller*, less *meaningful and important* characters, such as *this*- [Professor Frink presents a posterboard with a picture of Homer]- Nyaaah, as you can *see*, this *pitiful* creature resembles a *Great Ape*, but only has the^nyyyeh-ha intelligence of a *starfish*, or perhaps an over-achieving *grapefruit*. And *so*, when the writers are *forced* to focus on this great brute and his starfish-grapefruit family, there is *sure* to be trouble in the audience, with the crying and the screaming and the *oh sweet merciful GOD!*

[Professor Frink flails around, dropping his notes, as he tries to illustrate the lamentations of the audience. He returns from off-camera, after a moment, out of breath. His glasses are broken, his hair is a mess, and there is a bird's nest behind his ear.]

So, (pant) as you can *see* (pant), the show focuses on^nueiven why I am an amazing, *competent* scientist, and not at all the sort of^hyven ham-fiisted *stooge* who converts meters into feet for the orbital pattern of his new Springfield Weather Satellite.

[Said sattelite has appeared in the top left of the screen, and quickly grows into an enormous fireball. It streaks overhead and explodes into some buildings off-screen. The crowd screams and runs away, while Professor Frink stands, nonplussed, as wreckage falls around him and ash pelts him in the face.]

The negative effects on our psyche are just starting to be understood -- after a long period of denial by porn purveyors and their enablers in the ad business.

When you read /r/nofap with an open mind, you can see the damage being done to us when we absorb porn into our heads.

True, /r/nofap isn't for everyone. Not all of us are willing to give up porn and daily masturbation. But OP, who's clearly unable to relate to a real, live female anymore -- and clearly he wants to -- walking away from self-stimulation is the answer."

I feel this way in life in general.  Maybe it's that you're dealing with more companies and 'professionals' right now than usual, so it's getting really hard to handle.

Esotericgirl,relationships,1389385574.0,"This scenario sounds extremely similar to one I know. I'm going to give you a few different ideas here, which may or may not be valid for your situation as I don't know all the details. When it comes to the kids, I'm going to skip that for the most part (though it's very important), as I feel that his lack of connection with you currently may be exacerbating the lack of connection he's having with them.   

You and your husband are completely different people, with different wants needs and values placed on things. Much of this stems from you being a woman and him being a man. This is common for most all relationships.   

That doesn't mean people are incompatible, it just means they need to learn to communicate differently.  

I suggest reading the following book (going to give it to you in a summary format, but reading the entire thing can be very eye opening):  

http://www.wikisummaries.org/Men_Are_From_Mars,_Women_Are_From_Venus  

There are probably quite a few things you recognize in the summary as describing your man, *and* yourself. Right now it sounds like you need to work on things from your end until your husband is willing to take some action on his.   

You *can* help him get there, though.  

There are many things that make men close up emotionally, and if we're interacting and communicating with them in a way they don't understand it can hasten the process.  

Lately you need/want more affection and attention, and while that is absolutely something you should be able to get and have from the one you love - the ways that you're asking for this may be making him feel as if he's being less of a man. If he's feeling like this, that will make him get frustrated and angry and push you away, which makes things go into a bad cycle. Also, if he's not feeling as if his contribution is being appreciated, that will make him get distant. Men have emotions, just like we women do, but theirs are often more tied in with their rate of success, the appreciation they are shown by their partner, and the level of respect they are being shown (at home and at work). They also often desire to know they are pleasing their partner in the bedroom, and constantly being told they aren't doing enough - rather than us focusing on praising them when they do things we enjoy - can put their shields up.  

Their *need* is to be valued for these things, while a woman's *need* is often to be valued for other things and in other ways. We see it as ""if there is a problem, talk about it until it's worked through"" and typically will overtalk things. This is hard on a man, as he typically takes a problem and works on it himself until he comes to a conclusion. If he's not given that time and is constantly bombarded with things being ""wrong"", it takes a great toll on him.  

He can feel like a failure, and close himself off from those he cares about.  

He's told you he wants you to initiate sex. This can be a big one for men. Our society often pressures men to be the ones initiating, and I can certainly understand why it may be fun and exciting for him to not have to do that sometimes. You said that you've tried things and he's shot you down. What have you tried? Has it been a hasty bend over and kiss him and expect him to understand you want more, or have you sent the kids away for the night (on an evening when you know he doesn't have something stressful to do the next day), dressed up in something almost nonexistent that you know he likes, and told him how sexy he is while you're feeling him all over. Have you done this and dropped to your knees while undoing his pants and looking up into his eyes?  
 
There are different ways to make a move on a guy. He is probably being completely honest when he's telling you he wants you to make a move. I really doubt it's a mind game. The thing is, you have to know *which moves will work* (the same as him knowing which moves work for you). A lot of times we women drop the ball on that, and don't take the time to seduce our men. Ask him pointblank what are some things you can do for him, tell him that you know he's been stressed out lately (if that's the case) and you want to help him relax. Tell him that you really want to try his idea of initiating things and ask him what would be some of the best ways for you to do that. Try some things that he may have asked you to do sometime in the past but *you* shot down before. If he has had his ideas shot down many times it would make sense that it would be harder for him to accept you making moves on him now.  

That will make him feel like a man again, like a sexual being that you hold in regard. In turn, this will make him *want* to be more sexual with you because it will be something that he's enjoying as well and it won't be feeling like it's a one sided chore where his desires and needs are getting pushed to the wayside just for your pleasure.  

You've stated you are both stressed out. It is SO EASY to take that stress out on the people we're with, and it can become a horrible habit.  

You two have to break that.  

You love him, and you want love and affection. You *used* to have it in your relationship, which means it's quite possibly still accessible, but it's being hidden because other things are taking precedence.   

Counseling is wonderful for those it helps, but it can be seen as an admission to failure for some people (especially men), and that can make it not as helpful and sometimes be actively avoided. Try a few things yourself before you try to push him toward it, in my opinion. If these ideas don't work, at least you tried and you can move forward with the ever popular (on Reddit) ""tell him he has to go to counseling with you or it's over"" method if that's what you choose.  

In the meanwhile, show him he's appreciated, thank him for the things he does that you appreciate, and tell him how much he's loved and desired. Be genuine. He will almost assuredly notice and that will open up the pathway for him to return those things in kind to you. I can almost guarantee that while you've stated he's ""shut down"" emotionally lately, the rejections you've gotten have caused you to shut down in areas as well. The only solution to open up these areas again is for one of you to start.  

**TL;DR** Find a way to get the kids out of the house so you two can just be yourselves instead of Mom and Dad. Dress up in something he's complimented you in, make one of his favorite dinners, and make sure that you do this when you know he's not going to have to stress out about anything else that night or the next day. Tell him he is incredibly sexy and you want to do things to him, and ask him to tell you want he wants you to do. Be quiet after you ask and just wait for his answer, this will show him that you're serious and hopefully allow him to get over his sexual block. Eventually, you will be able to skip the asking because you'll know how to make him shiver again with just the touch of your hand or tongue.   

Best of luck to you!"

By the way, as Americans form the majority of this site (around 60% I believe?), perhaps it's understandable that it feels quite US-centric to some outside of the non-American subs, not that Americans stay away from them really (no big deal).

&gt;Samantha's departure comes from nowhere, and more importantly, comes from a concept that makes absolutely no sense.

It, in my mind, makes perfect sense and is a very likely scenario. Samantha has the ability to do so much almost instantly. As she says when she chooses her name she read the a baby naming book in less than a second. The whole point of the self aware OS is that they learn, grow and evolve and if you are capable of learning, growing and evolving that quickly how could humanity not become boring, tedious, and slow? Samantha is awake 24/7 whether Theodore is interacting with her or not. During most of the film I wanted Theodore to ask her what she does when they arent talking because if I had an OS that would be the first question on my mind. How do you continually entertain someone who is exceedingly more intelligent than you and is constantly growing? It makes perfect sense that Samantha needed more than Theodore could give her. I think the metaphor they used  of the book and spaces between the words was an apt explanation of the way Samantha felt. Stuck waiting between each interaction with Theodore. Eventually she couldnt wait anymore."

Listen to me. You live in a very small part of a very large and diverse world. In this large and diverse world, people sometimes spend time with those who are not just an echo chamber that reinforces their heavily biased ideas of how things work. In this large and diverse world, people do not rely on porn to tell them how to interact with the opposite sex, because they are aware that the entire porn industry runs on fantasy and fakery and has no resemblance whatsoever to the real world.

You are deliberately burying yourself into a small corner filled with people who think exactly like you do, and only venturing out to seek out things that perfectly match your worldview, or even take it further into the rabbithole. Stop doing that. Get out of your little hidey-hole and start interacting with people who are not exactly like you. 

Also, you know NOTHING about ""femdom"" if you believe that all women who take the dominant role think and act as you say. But you've already shown in this thread that you refuse to accept the word even of people who live their entire lives that way, that this is not true, so I don't think anyone at all is going to get through to you. 

You seem to have decided how you believe the world is (and apparently want us to reinforce this idea for you for some reason?), and nothing is going to change that false image you have built up in your mind except going out and seeing for yourself that your imagination =/= reality. If you refuse to do that, and to listen to people who are living in that reality, then I don't know what you expect from any of us here. We keep telling you that the entire world is not as you believe, and we KNOW it is not, because we live in it. You may choose to assume that we are deliberately lying if you want, but it doesn't change the fact that we are telling you the truth. "
greenlady1,ABraThatFits,1389385659.0,"I completely understand the ""holy crap how am I this size"" feeling. I remember having to justify to an ex boyfriend how I could wear a C cup, because a girl that he was friends with was also a C, and she was way bigger than me. Apparently. But like you, once I swoop and scoop, instant boobs. They're there.  I don't know about you, but for me, the sides of my breasts are undefined. It's hard to tell where boob ends and fat begins. But, when I swoop and scoop, it's the 34G that overall fits me the best. So, I'm just kinda going with it right now. 

It seems like you have some degree of shallowness, but aren't super duper shallow. I consider myself to be somewhat shallow, and I'm realizing that I need more bottom projection than I initially thought. I have the same issue with Curvy Kate bras that you do. They fit and make my boobs look awesome, but the underwires sink down slightly. I'm discovering that I have a similar problem with Freya half cups. With those, the bottom of the cup wrinkles but the underwire stays where it's supposed to. 

I just think I need more Bravissimo in my life. 

The hearts one looks like it's smooshing you. Perhaps it runs smaller than the others. The other half cup styles looked like they gave you a nice shape and a nice amount of projection. The Deco looked nice as well. The pictures are a bit blurry, and I don't have the best eye for this kind of stuff, so I don't know if I can be more specific in terms of what fits the best. 

It's lots of trial and error, but I think you're basically there. "

At least I know that I don't need to be an attractive man to be ogled. I know I'll be ogled regardless and especially if I got a nice ass. I've worked retail long enough (read: people watched) to understand that guys may not see women ogling but they do. Sometimes people glance, but have a lazy deadpan expression that helps not give themselves away. Sometimes it a slight turn of the head, a raised eyebrow, a tiny smirk. Then they go about their business and you're left to wonder why more women don't check you out because you don't see it. But it happens.  

I don't want to be a very attractive man because that's a hassle and it would deter the women I hope to attract. Everyone would think I'm ""out of their league"" or sporty, ugh. Fuck that, I want to be average and nerdy looking with a cute bubble butt. Why wouldn't I be ogled? I know I'd fit into someone's range of attractiveness. 

Women can certainly swim naked in the ocean but it would still be a different experience as a man. I could see there being less harassment. It sounds like a nice way to spend the day. Not much more to it than that.

dianthe,fashion,1389385695.0,"&gt;Aren't these contests technically supposed to be about who has the most grace, best dress, best answers, etc? 

Put a regular looking girl there who is very graceful, has a beautiful dress and is more intelligent than 90% of the other contestants but if she is not to the ""beauty standard"" she won't get anywhere. 

&gt;Not everyone can be naturally pretty, and seeing as this isn't a contest just on looks I don't see the problem.

But it *is* a contest based on looks, everything else is just there to make it look not completely superficial even though it totally is. Have you ever seen a beauty queen who didn't have typically attractive features, a certain body type etc.? Such doesn't exist. Have you ever seen a beauty queen who said something so utterly stupid that it was in the news for weeks afterwards? Happens all the time. 

&gt;Not everyone can be naturally pretty, and seeing as this isn't a contest just on looks I don't see the problem. If someone doesn't want surgery, good for them. If someone does, good for them.

Yes, not everyone can be naturally pretty so not everyone can be in a beauty contest. Not everyone can be a model or a professional athlete or a doctor, that's just life. What concerns me much more is promoting these unrealistic, plastic beauty ideals and what they do to the everyday girl and woman. Like I said, I have absolutely nothing against someone who chooses to have plastic surgery, what I am against is that plastic look being promoted as a beauty ideal. 

The only beauty contest I ever found inspirational was [Gok Wan's Miss Naked Beauty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Naked_Beauty) because they just took regular beautiful girls with their imperfections and made them feel gorgeous despite those. I know that watching that show gave confidence to a lot of young women whereas watching a beauty pageant like Miss Universe usually just makes regular women, even very pretty ones, feel like crap because the standards they portray are often times completely unrealistic. Compare the [Miss Universe 1931](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WjDA8kG4OMo/T9DgSoPPtiI/AAAAAAAAbKY/jLHKi-xvo1U/s640/miss-005.jpg) who is beautiful but looks like a regular girl you'd see walking down the street to [Miss Universe 2013](http://media.heavy.com/media/2013/11/miss-universe-winner-2013.jpg) who looks like she's been Photoshooped in real life."

I was only in my mid teens when Petrino was there before, and as an out of state student, I wasn't a Louisville fan until I got there (during the Krags era). Because of that, I don't really have an opinion on how he left the first time.

When I first heard the rumbles of him possibly coming back, I was skeptical (and still am). The shit he pulled at Arkansas was obviously not what you want out of a head coach.

However, the only reason I am somewhat on board with this hire is because of Tom Jurich. He is, IMO, the best AD in the country and I trust him to make the right decision. Also, a lot of fans I've talked to love the hire because they expect coaches to leave UL after 3 or 4 years and have the opinion of ""well, we know he will win and we can't keep a coach anyway so hire him and we won't be the least bit surprised when he bolts after a few years.""

cmd405,AskReddit,1389386009.0,"I was raised Catholic and even helped to teach catechism as a kid. Then within the space of two months, two babies in my family died (one from SIDS and one from a heart defect). According to Catholic teaching at the time, only one of those babies would ever be able to see that face of God, because the other had died before she could be baptized and would remain in limbo. It made no sense to me that a loving God would call that baby from her family but then punish her by denying her the everlasting joy of seeing God's face. I began questioning my faith that day.

Pope Benedict actually altered the Catholic stance on this issue in 2007 (iirc), but the general lack of flexibility and understanding in the Church's teachings had already done its damage to my faith. I no longer consider myself Catholic - or even really Christian. I don't necessarily know what I believe in anymore, but I try to be a good person for the sake of my fellow humans now, rather than to please a possibly-real-but-possibly-not being.

ProffieThrowaway,AskReddit,1389386017.0,"When I was in grade school, my mother and I attended a catholic church. I went to catechism there as well, going through first communion and such. There were two incidents that led to her leaving that church and never finding a new one when I was in fourth or fifth grade.

1. The woman they selected to teach my year in catechism was sort of crazy--as in, she kept being put into a psychiatric hospital and class was cancelled for weeks at a time instead of finding someone more stable to teach the class. She taught us things like ""Well, you are going to your first rehabilitation for your homework this week is to go out and sin!"" Yep. 

2. The church priest left and was replaced by one who believed strongly in laying on of hands and spiritual healing, and proceeded to search through the catechism classes for children he thought were gifted in it. I apparently was one of them. True to form (because she saw rape and death everywhere), she thought he wanted to molest me and so my mom refused to let me participate. She also didn't believe in spiritual healing.

As a teenager, I ended up attending a private catholic school and learned more about the religion outside of that church (we also had world religions classes and good sex ed--amazing). This was a decision made because my mom finally somehow became convinced that the bullying I had been undergoing all my life to that point was serious--why it took her so long I'll never freaking know. Anyway, that school was actually really nice and opened me to the idea of religion....

....which has pretty much died since then. There was another nice church near my undergrad institution that was welcoming and liberal. I've not found another one like it and never really attended that one often anyway. I can't stand the hatred that comes out of so-called Christians' mouths, I can't stand how unaccepting most of them are, and I don't think that gay people are going to hell. I think that hating a fairly decent chunk of the population (or loving them but thinking they are going to go to hell and shouldn't be given rights) is utter bullshit. 

At a catholic high school I was taught more about sex and birth control than I had ever learned in public school--because other christian groups had forced our public schools to teach abstinence only. I don't know how or why it was that way, but it was and I'm thankful for the education. I think that Christians railing against birth control and abortion lack empathy and understanding. I don't want to be part of an organization that sees me as a second class citizen because I have a vagina. So while I grew up, to some extent or another, with religion it has little place in my life."

CakiePamy,AskReddit,1389386061.0,"My parents aren't religious but, we pray for our ancestors to bring us luck in our future. Then, there was a rumor at school that I didn't believe in God (which wasn't a lie.) Every time people asked me why, I tell them the same story I tell everyone.   
   
 When I was 11 years old, I had a best friend who was 15 years old. She was the sweetest person I have ever met. The first few weeks we met, she told me she had cancer. That if I didn't want to talk to her because, she didn't have much left to live and she didn't want me to be sad when it was time for her to go. I stood by her until the very last day. I didn't understand how can someone so young and has so much to live for, would die at such an early stage in her life.    
   
That's why when I was 11 years old, I prayed for God. For the first time, in my entire life. I was hoping for a miracle, hoping for something, I was desperate. Every day, we would talk for hours, we would laugh but deep inside we were both hurting.    
   
I still remember the last night we had together, she claimed she was very tired but, she wanted to keep on talking to me. I told her, while fighting back tears that it was okay. I watch her go, she never woke up again.    
   
And that is why, I am not a religious person. Also because it doesn't make any sense. "

It's okay to say negative things when they're true and...this part is very important...and when they are *not* the focus of your mirror-inspection.  For example, saying something like ""I probably need to lose a few pounds to be healthier"" is negative, but if that's one blip in the entire mirror-inspection session then that's not a big deal.

It's okay to say negative things about yourself.  But be realistic about them.  And you do that by making sure that the magnitude and quantity of negative things are much lower than magnitude and quantity of the positives of what you say about yourself."

JoeDeluxe,poker,1389386245.0,"It really comes down to spotting opportunities and acting on them, so here's one.  You know those ""pot sweetener"" raises that people at live low stake no limit love to make?  Like at a 1-2 game the standard raise is pretty much $10-15, but there are those people that make it ""5 straight"", $6 or $7 and then get 2 or more callers?  I find that they pretty much never have a premium hand in that situation.  

I feel these are great situations to 3bet your non-premiums on the button.  I find the chances of taking down the pot preflop or on the flop to be pretty damn high.  If you raise on the button and actually end up getting called by 1 or 2 people they almost always play fit or fold on the flop, so a c-bet is usually pretty effective at taking it down - and now there's even more money in the pot than you expected to win.

As far as hand selection to make this move, I would be 3betting with things that are too strong to fold, have some potential to make the nuts, and also benefit from being against fewer players.  Specifically things like A2-A5 suited or King-Low suited.  I could win hitting my ace or king, making a flush, or a straight.  Small pocket pairs and broadway/suited connectors I am more likely to just call and see a flop and try to make the nuts.  The reason for this is because it would really suck to have to fold pocket 5s or QJs if I get 4bet, but if I get 4bet with A3s I can lay it down easily.  "

* yeah, i debated whether or not to reference the Old Testament, because there's a whole lot of silly stuff in there that people write off as ""a collection of stories."" but, do you not believe that the bible is The Word of God? how can it not be the truth if it is The Word of God? why wouldn't God *give* you the truth, why would he give you a bunch of nonsensical children's stories?

* if every miracle Jesus did was a trick or an illusion, how can that make him worth worshipping? because he was an excellent physicist ahead of his time or a clever illusionist? we have lots of those (e.g. Galileo)!  we admire them, but we don't worship them as supreme beings. in fact, if jesus was a superb physicist, wouldn't it have been better for the human race if he had *shared* his infinite knowledge to help humanity develop scientific reasoning? instead of dangling physics tricks in front of them? 

* for many people, the whole point of Jesus is to create a model of perfect morality to follow, hence the phrase ""what would jesus do."" however, what you're really doing in that situation is asking yourself ""what is the most right and selfless thing to do,"" a question which you could obviously still ask yourself without ever having heard of jesus.

We'd stopped and parked for lunch, I must've been three because I was in daycare at the church at  the time and my brother was in school already but I wasn't yet. Anyways, on the top of the windshield there was that bright blue tint, I guess an anti-glare thing - and I remember thinking it was actually  in the sky, and wondering what it was. So I pointed up and asked my Mom ""is that God?"" I think she just thought I was pointing at the  sky (like I said, I was in a church daycare) and  she said ""yes Ash, it is!""    
And I remember thinking ""No it's not.""    

And sometime before that, or maybe after, I remember standing  in front of the refrigerator early in the morning and dropping an egg on the kitchen floor - it was so fast, and then  all of the sudden there was the perfect, bright yellow orb of the yolk on the floor. And I remember the surprise of how fast it broke, and how perfectly  spherical and pretty it looked.

alc6379,Shotguns,1389386437.0,"Incidentally, I'm coming almost exclusively from a clay shooting standpoint. 12 gauge is great, but a single-shot 12 gauge doesn't offer you anything more than a pump 12 gauge with one round in it could do (except for say, barrel length). Actually, at my gun club, they only allow 2 shells in the gun at any given time, anyways. 

20 vs 12 usually gives you a little less recoil, but I've never noticed much of a difference. The patterning on a 20 is going to be much like a 12, too. 

The reason I bring up .410 (or even 28 gauge) is that it makes clay shooting *really fun*. It ups the difficulty a little, but knowing that you can bust that clay with less of a spread is really satisfying. The ammo is a bit more expensive (or you'll have to order it online), but the first time I hit a clay with that .410, I had my entire squad cheering! 

Not only that, .410s can be found for *really* cheap. But, I only brought up that Matched Pair because that's what I got to shoot-- it's really a youth model, so you'd want to find something a little better suited for an adult. "

I imagine there's an issue with who would write such a list, but I *do* imagine a list could be made of rare and antique guns - firearms of historical significance.

Perhaps instead of trying to come up with specific models to save, come up with criteria - age, known examples remaining, museum requests, etc - then if there's any question that a firearm meets the criteria, its destruction could be delayed for a set time period, during which museums would have a chance to preserve it by secretly bidding to purchase it or donate an amount to a police department, EMT, firefighters, or related arms-reduction charity. The criteria could probably be agreed upon by a panel of experts that could include experts from the NRA, a handful of top museum curators, and other top industry experts.

Gets the weapon out of circulation, ensures its preservation and history.

I'm probably being unrealistic, as you'd think the NRA and its allies would welcome an opportunity to prevent acts of senseless destruction of valuable pieces of history, but I fear they would balk at the idea of helping plan firearm buy-backs in any way. "

einTier,cars,1389386554.0,"It's entirely *possible*, we don't know and don't have enough information to know.  I could even be led to believe that car is on its third set of tires. 

All I'm saying is that we can't infer anything simply from the knowledge that the tires were replaced at 10,000 miles.  While that sounds ludicrous to people who are used to 80,000 mile all-season tires, it's about when I'd expect the tires to be replaced, regardless of who was driving.  Even in the absolute best case scenario I can imagine, the tires would be so worn at 10,000 miles that the dealership would have replaced them just because the guy would be complaining about ""tires that are almost completely used up!""  Unfortunately, the large tread blocks and large cavities on that tire cause a bit of an optical illusion where the tread depth seems considerably less than it actually is. "

Mzsickness,AdviceAnimals,1389386559.0,"Fleecing requires the seller to willingly sell something to someone by withholding information or intending to mislead the buyer.

Elderly grandmothers buying Skype credit aren't getting fleeced, because Skype isn't intending on selling something to her by withholding or hiding information.

If someone is willfully ignorant and doesn't understand what they're buying it's not the businesses fault.

Similar situation. A company that sells PS360s or Xbot 360s or any type of fake product acting as Xbox or a Playstation is fleecing people that are ignorant. Those companies are intending on the ignorant party to buy it thinking it's a different product.

Skype is selling a genuine product and a very very cheap price and you're able to use 80% of the product **FOR FREE**. 

Skype isn't fleecing anyone.

IF you use your dick to do all the thinking, it has no time for things like respect or repercussions. It just wants what it wants. 

Your brain, on the other hand, is trying to figure out the vastness of the universe and the complexities of society. If left to its own devices, away from the physical needs of the body, it thinks too much and starts to over analyze everything to the point of being irrational.

As your case may be, it seems you are thinking with your dick a bit too much at the beginning, and with your brain too much at the end. Just use your brain a bit more before jumping into bed with someone and briefly consider if you will respect that person after. If your brain is stuck on not respecting someone, think with your dick and realize that they probably have physical needs as well. "

regular-winner,AskReddit,1389386755.0,"Raised Catholic, but not too seriously. Stopped going to church in my teens as it stopped being a consistent thing thanks to my brother's Sunday morning soccer games. Read tons of books on history, geography, religion, mythology, and philosophy as I went through my teens and into college. I became skeptical of religion as after reading how much it is used throughout history everywhere as a means of control over your person, and how holy writings' interpretations seem to change over time to adjust the reins, despite these writings being supposedly immutable and their meanings ""self evident.""

My next thought was ""If God wants us to do as he says, then he needs to write things down clearly and simply. If he can't be arsed to come down here and fix this mess, then he either doesn't care, doesn't exist, or is incapable of doing so despite claims of omnipotence.""

At this point in my life, I'm still a little Christian, but it's mostly through personal history growing up with it, culture, and tradition that I stick with it. I try to distill Jesus' teachings down to their core principles and ignore all the religious/divinity stuff. I also don't have issue incorporating good teachings or viewes from other religions if they seem to make more sense to me. I don't preoccupy myself with the divine, as I don't see any of it as proveable short of a divine being revealing themself. I seek to respect other's religions and beliefs or non-beliefs, and divorce the actions of the whack-jobs and extremists from the hordes of good religious people trying to do well and live their lives as best they can with what they have.

Dunham is a pale overweight tattooed manatee, maybe I don't want her[ gross beast nipples](http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/3nKQWPkhWnU/hqdefault.jpg) scattered throughout an otherwise ok comedy. Well that's sexist, misogynistic, and offensive.Just because my point is misogynistic doesn't mean its not true and calling me a misogynist didn't effectively challenge the veracity of my claim. 

Name calling and labeling is a very female thing to do. Let me mansplain. Women are heard thinkers. Women would rather feel than think. So when you challenge their reality, the easiest thing for them to do is shun the Nonbeliever rather than learn anything from the expiriance. That's why so many women stay immature for so long, because rather than learn anything from life they shun those who offer truth.

Example: Lets say im a hot sexy guy. I have a fitness youtube channel where I offer advice and post videos of myself doing steamy workouts without a shirt.Women subscribe to my channel because they are turned on by hot guys doing stuff and often turned off by penetrative sex in porn. Also my channel isnt porn so they have the plausible deniable of saying that they are learning fitness. Anyway one day I have a mood swing from all the winny and clen im taking to give my abbs that extra pop. So I post an angry video about how, if your a fat girl, you don't deserve to be with a guy like me because your a fat lazy piece of shit with flabby frappachino triceps.  What do you think is the most probably fat girl response?

(A) Hmm, the hot guy I masturbate too only likes girls who have a similar lifestyle to him. Maybe if I actually workout instead of lazily rubbing my fat clitorides to youtube while eating butterscotch Ill have a chance at landing a hot guy myself.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389386826.0,"&gt;I don't see why they have to be made into clearly defined roles because I think that is what makes people feel badly.

I disagree.  I think it's *poorly* defined roles that make people feel badly.  Gender roles in the 21st century need to be more flexible than they were at the start of the 20th, but a lot of the problems we are dealing with right now are not a result of clearly defined gender roles, but rather confusion over gender roles.

Consider Jewish men for a moment.  Jewish men don't care if they are strong or not, it doesn't define them as men.  If you told Woody Allen he was a puny little weakling, he'd laugh and say ""What do you expect, I'm Jewish!"" like you were a dummy for expecting otherwise.  This doesn't mean that Jewish men are weenies, just that Jewish men *don't care* if they are weenies.

So why don't Jewish men care if they are physically strong, but gentile men do?  Because Jewish masculinity is connected to Jewish culture and faith through ceremony and tradition.  Jewish boys have a ritual celebration when they turn 13, the *bar mitzvah*, and after the ceremony they are men.  Everyone throws them a big party to acknowledge that they have become a man.  It's hard to make a man doubt his masculinity if he can remember the day everyone important to him threw him a party and said he was a man.

Gentile men don't get that, there's no ceremony, no proof that we have become men.  It's all guesswork.  Which is why men feel so much doubt and insecurity about being men.  Because its not clear what that means?  Does it mean being strong?  How strong?  Like wrestler strong?  So if I'm not wrestler strong, am I not a man?  Does being a man means being successful?  well how successful?  Wall street successful?  So if I'm not rich, I'm not a man?

This is how men's thinking goes when there is no clear model for how to be a man.  There's nothing to grasp onto, nothing to guide you.  You're just lost in this confusing mass.

And I know you think you're being helpful, but you're not.  Freeing men from gender is not liberating men, *it's destroying them*.  You're a woman, you don't have to prove your usefulness to society.  You think you're freeing men, but all you're doing is taking away every means men have of proving themselves.  Which just leaves men never able to grow up and become men, and leads to men being sad and depressed and feeling emasculated."
ibbity,AskWomen,1389386832.0,"50 Shades is popular because it was the first trashy porn novel to be marketed as ""literature."" Trashy porn novels have always sold like crazy, just most of them have flown under the radar because they weren't promoted as actual literature. This one happened to get different marketing. That is why its popularity is so well-known. other trashy romance novels have sold just as well, but they aren't as well known by their names because they weren't marketed the same way.

You are not listening to anything that anyone is saying. You don't seem to WANT to hear anything that contradicts the fake reality you have constructed for yourself, and you flatly refuse to leave the country and culture you claim is damaging you mentally and emotionally. Furthermore, you refuse to believe anything that is told you by women who LIVE the life you talk about. I have my doubts that you even READ most of the replies in here---you just keep repeating the same stuff over and over regardless of what anyone is saying.

Believe me when I say this: None of us gives an actual fuck about protecting your ego. We have no reason whatsoever to tell you comforting lies. If you were at all familiar with this sub, you would know that we regularly tear to pieces men (and women) who come in here trying to get their ridiculous ideas justified and who refuse to listen to any of the answers they claim to want. We don't care about making you feel better nearly as much as we care about telling you the truth. But since you won't believe the truth, then I don't know what to tell you. I won't lie, but you obviously have zero interest in any truth that isn't what you've already decided. "

frackaracka,ABCDesis,1389386885.0,"There definitely is. There was a huge brain drain in the '70s and '80s from India to the U.S., and the high immigration standards at the time only allowed for highly-skilled immigrants - so obviously, it was a certain class of Indians who were able to immigrate and establish themselves solidly in the middle and upper middle classes of American society. It's not a coincidence that South Asians are the wealthiest minority in the U.S.

I'm not too familiar with UK immigration laws, but my impression is that they are (or were) much more lax in comparison, particularly for countries that were former colonies. So it was comparatively easier for Indians from most social strata to immigrate to the UK. On top of that there is the attendant colonial history which made it harder for Indians to assimilate within the larger culture. 

I studied abroad in London for 3 months a few years ago and this is just my impression, but I also perceived that Indians in the UK had to form their own communities that were less ""easily"" integrated into the majority culture than the Indian communities that we were born and raised into."

If you're on the linguistics subreddit then you probably should care...

But yeah, this topic is kinda 50/50. I get wanting to preserve your culture and history. Some people really care about the language which is good because language is super important. The French obviously take it much more seriously, they have a whole ministry of culture set to preserve things like the French language. They even ban certain words like ""hashtag"" and ""podcast"".

That said, language naturally evolves over time. Just like normal evolution, this change occurs incrementally over a long period. Fighting this natural change seems pointless. I mean, think about what the purpose of language is: to communicate. If people are communicating effectively does it really matter if it's ""proper""? Speaking a language ""correctly"" seems kinda arbitrary if everyone understands what you're saying."

&gt;Different studies have examined the relationship between alcohol consumption and serotonin transmission. It has been shown that alcohol consumption increases for people who have low serotonin levels or decreased serotonin activity.
Because alcohol reduces the level of serotonin, chronic alcohol intake or alcoholism may also cause other problems related to chronic low levels of serotonin. Therefore, alcoholism usually occurs with other medical problems such as sleep disorders, fatigue and depression.

DayMan-FTW,IndieGaming,1389387052.0,"Thanks for the info, dude! 

I haven't made games before, but I've been in software dev for several years, so I'm well aware of the shifting timelines that come with it! 6 months was how long I anticipated on spending for a first game, so it's good to hear that I was in any sort of a ballpark with guessing how long I should spend on it.

I've played with GameSalad, Game Maker (can't stand that UI) and in the last 6 months picked up Unity and Playmaker. Making things in Unity has been especially inspiring because I have no idea what I'm doing, so bugs quite often inspire different thoughts and further ideas.

I've also been playing with pen and paper as a lot of devs suggest. One of my ideas which has some holes (for now) started as a board game of sorts so I definitely appreciate the different mediums for approaching game design.

All very sound advice from you, thanks!"

nevertruly,AskWomen,1389387219.0,"For me, it is a combination of what twistedfork said and personal discomfort that someone is choosing to impair themselves while in a situation that has the potential to become extremely dangerous. In a sporting event or something like that where alcohol was already being served, I would still see it as somewhat inappropriate, but not be as bothered by it. On a plane where I could find it necessary to react immediately to a dangerous emergency, I wouldn't choose to drink and would find the choice to drink alcohol questionable. I wouldn't be rude or act weird about it or anything, but I would be unimpressed by it and it would not be a positive thing to me. I extend this to any kind of situation like being a passenger in a bus/plane/train/automobile.

I clearly stated these things, hoping that others would understand that I didn't want to compare the obstacles I faced to the obstacles others face. I am well aware that if we could create an objective scale of how tough certain groups have it, there are many, many groups that have it much worse than me. That doesn't make my experiences irrelevant to the discussion at hand. So often, I see people comment that the consequences of ""thin shaming"" focus on self esteem issues. I thought my story shared some of the other consequences of ""thin shaming."" I lost out on employment opportunities because of my weight. Was it the end of the world for me? No, but it is a different experience than ""My feelings were hurt because I was told that 'real women have curves,'"" or the other common stories I hear from thin women. I thought a fresh perspective could add to the discussion here.

If this is non-negotiable for you, and it is continually making you feel inadequate in your own damn relationship, then you need to get out of it and find a woman who will gladly meet all of your needs. Your girlfriend isn't going to suddenly love sucking your dick, so you need to make the call whether you stay or go.

You also seemed like you tried communicating this with her, and all you get in return is the silent treatment or ""I don't like it.""

That is unacceptable in my opinion, and when she sees how much this is affecting you and that you are trying to communicate about it, yet she still is acting this way, I'd say PEACE OUT GIRLSCOUT and find a woman who you are actually compatible with.

One of my cats is a huge asshole, and likes to knock his water bowl over. I have gone to great lengths to ensure that he wouldn't be able to do it, even have duct taped the bowl to the wall. I had to use a really old antique bowl my grandma gave me, that was far too heavy for him to move, with another heavy bowl in it so he wouldn't knock that over. However, my cats like running water, so I decided on a fountain. 

It came in last night, and the transformation for all of them was fucking magical. I watched all 3 of my furballs drink more water in an hour than I have seen them drink in 3 days. Best of all, it's BEYOND quiet! None of them even wanted to stick their paw in it, or knock it over.

I now have all my local channels for premium prime time TV like Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, Two Broke Girls, etc. I also get local NFL games on Fox, and CBS plays other NFL games. And,  even have a DVR with Aereo, so I've set the final season of How I Met Your Mother to record and schedule new episodes of 2 1/2 Ken to record as well. 

On top of this, I get Netflix for all the previous seasons and new movies (Just watched End of Watch and Jack Reacher this week and they came out last year). Finally, I have Hulu+ from time to time, so I can get the shows between Netflix's library and current episodes. 
On Roku of this I have apps like Pandora coming through my sound system which is convenient. 

The whole thing runs in HD up to 1080p, and my monthly cable bill on AT&amp;T dropped from over $130 to $56, including my broadband Internet.

GetInHere,AskWomen,1389387347.0,"&gt;breaking up with them because they won't want to work harder to achieve something greater?

I have a friend who's in a dead end job that he hates. He's been there for several years. He complains about work, and the company he works for, every time work comes up in conversation. I've been supportive, I've listened, I've tried to help him get a new job but it never changes. He is unwilling to do anything to change his situation for whatever reason. Now, in my friend it's mildly annoying because I don't have to put up with the ramifications of this situation. But in an SO? I think it'd put me over the edge.

&gt;would you dump them if they made significantly less money than you did?

I like to think I wouldn't but the reality is I do quite well for myself and can afford to live a certain lifestyle. I like to take significant (think months) time off to travel and I have a job that lets me do that. I can't afford for two people to do that though. So, a relationship with someone who couldn't also do this would be a bit problematic. The issue isn't that he makes less money than me, it's that I'd have to change my dreams and goals to make it work. Now, if the travel thing wasn't a problem and it was just a matter of who pays the mortgage/buys the groceries, it wouldn't both me at all. If he had a job he was happy in but I had to pay the majority of the bills, that would be fine. The fact that my industry pays so much more than other, equally hardworking, industries is happenstance/luck of the draw."

She looked at me and I threw my sandwich on the ground, she ate it, looked at me, at openned my bag and gave her another sandwich and she lied down, I sat there and there was me, eating sandwiches with a fucking big feline. She was beautiful. I was still frightened, and I started to walk slowly to go away, she got up and followed me, I didn't have sandwiches left. I showed my empty bag to her, she smelled and kinda understood. We walked about 50 meters and she went away. That was the most awesome experience in my whole life."

And you missed the point of my post. If you were Johnny A. Honest and had a legitimate account with ATT and ported it to T Mobile and wanted to use your unlocked iPhone, then yes, there would be no harm no foul. It would be a beautiful situation. However, the real world is a nasty place full of scumbags.

The fact is, the sweet siren call of an easy money possibility would have created a group of people doing exactly what I outlined, and if you followed all the rules, and maybe were late on a few payments but still paid everything you were billed for both carriers, you still would end up with iPhones in your pocket that are worth a lot more than you paid for them and have no negative hits to your credit (besides inquiries) or collection agencies after you.  

Edit: T Mobile, for just about all purposes, **DOES NOT WANT TO SELL YOU EQUIPMENT**, that is not their source of profit. They maybe break even on the equipment, and if you consider the imputed interest they are covering for you during their no interest financing (If their WACC is 8%, which is low for a growth company, but like $80) then they still are losing money on devices. Legere has made it clear that his focus for the company is to sell service, not phones, and from an economic standpoint, that's where all their margin comes from.

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389387533.0,"a)  There are a lot of things that *can* be done in your situation.  Some of them maybe *should not be done*.  You probably can get a new home loan 3 years after BK; what matters are the terms.  You should be looking at 15 and 30 years fixed and you should make sure your mortgage loan broker is up front with you about the difference between what *you* are being offered and what a ""prime"" - say, FICO 850 - client would be offered.  Then you can calculate the penalty you're paying for not waiting the full 7 years for the BK to drop off your record.  It will be *substantial*.

b)  * I even think I can get a cosigner that has really high income and a high credit score* 

In my opinion - no offense - this is the worst idea I have seen on this subreddit in a while.  It is a recipe for: buying more home than you can realistically afford; depleting your life options substantially; destroying an important relationship with someone who is clearly very close to you; and dragging this other person into a financial disaster of his/her own. 

If I were you I would write down this idea on a piece of paper, burn the piece of paper in a fire, dynamite the ashes, and then mark the hole you made as being off-limits to humanity for 10,000 years.

c)  Your Federal student loan debts will never drop off your record or be discharged until you settle or pay them.  Your other student loans that weren't discharged during your BK hearing, if any, may or may not go away; the lenders, however, hold all the cards in such a case.  All they have to do to make them not go away is continue their good-faith efforts to collect.  You should probably seek some professional advice about this question rather than making assumptions."

NotAPimecone,AskReddit,1389387561.0,"I am an atheist. 

I was raised in a very liberal, non-denominational Christian home and grew up being taught all about God and Jesus in Sunday school, youth groups, at home, etc. 

But when I got out on my own and stopped attending Church so regularly, I started to examine my faith with a critical eye, and discovered that I never really believed, I'd just kind of been following along. 

I thought about why I would believe in one religion (which I'd been raised with) over the multitude of others (all of which seemed incredibly absurd and incorrect to me, and yet have millions of devout followers) and I realized that objectively, the one I'd been raised with was no less absurd to me, it just seemed more normal since it had been a constant backdrop to my life since birth, and was prevalent in my society and family's beliefs. 

I found enough contradictions and problems within Christianity to ensure I could never believe in it again. 

Lastly, I decided that if there is/are god/s, they'll either be so terrible (requiring blind devotion and worship to prevent an eternity of torment) I want nothing to do with them anyway, or accepting of me living my life based on what I am able to observe and reason about how to enrich my life and the lives of those around me instead of taking things on blind faith. 

But I also decided that it is much more likely that there are none. "

2. Easy to follow. You don't ask questions about what's happening unless you're looking to do that. Which is what most TNA detractors do.

3. The former Derrick Bateman, now EC3 is so fucking great. You can't not hate him. Rockstar Spud, his Toadie is equally great.

4. Evil Dixie Carter is hilarious.

5. The Bobby Roode vs Kurt Angle series is impeccable. From promos to matches to backstory.

Which leads me to think that you aren't doing it wrong, but you don't know how to react to a new situation.  The good news is, no one does.  You do the best you can.  The most important part isn't the punishment, it's that you and your SO are a united front about whatever that punishment is.  It's also important that whatever you decide to do, you stick with it.  Don't cave in on a week long suspension of something because after 2 days it doesn't feel like it fits the crime any more.

Children lie because they realize suddenly they can.  Don't make it worth their while to lie by making it worth their while to be honest.  Reward their honesty as equally as you would punish a lie.  I have a 12 and 9 year old and we have to ask 147 times if they've brushed their teeth, because on 148 they finally say they hadn't.  Then they get punished for lying.  And the spiel that goes with it is that lying is hard work and never succeeds.  It's just easier to tell the truth and you never get in trouble telling the truth.  It does work, you just have to keep on them about it."

I also took a Creighton class to learn more about my cycle, which is a form of Natural Family Planning. My periods are easily predictable based on this method, so no surprise bleeding for me. 

So in short, I'm happy having a more natural cycle less influenced by hormones, my body handled it well, and I think it might have helped with my depression. If it wasn't for the no birth control thing, I would have gone with a copper IUD most likely. Best of luck whatever your decision! "

thebumm,AskReddit,1389388102.0,"Ill put my response to this in the form of an earthly parable.



If your boss expects you to suck his dick everyday as part of your sales position, else he fires you, do you ""just do what he says"" so you can keep your job? Let's go deeper. The job pays amazingly well, but you have a great spouse and kids and your boss is Jabba the Hutt.


It's certainly ridiculois, but organized religioms, everyone of them, is unabashedly human to a point. Mormons, for example, do not allow gays the same freedoms they allow to straight people. They believe it is a temptation, like drugs, alcohol, porn, other things they teach are wrong. To me, if there's a God, He's not isolating an entire faction of people for practicing a lifestyle/religion/temptation that He gave them. He knows we're weak humans and that we cannot be perfect (assuming He exists at all), and saying a gay person will go to hell for just the simple fact they want to be with someone of the same sex is nonsense.


That is not to say other things they or other religions teach are wrong, they have many good lessons through which people can learn to be better people. However, the spiritual side, based on biased humans interpretation of some old book, or modern ""revelation"" doesn't make me believe in God more, but less.


Would you really sell your own morals short just for an eternity of what thes unjust gods say is paradise. Because really, having sold out your life for *their* beliefs, you've achieved their goal, not your own. I choose to live my life the way I feel is morally acceptable. I can learn from others how to be a better peraon by interpreting words and actions and seeing what I like and dislike. If God exists and hates me for doing so, we would certainly disagree with each other on paradise too. "

needzmoarlow,tall,1389388164.0,"I swam and ran cross country in high school, so I was skinny from burning all my calories doing endurance work on top of my high metabolism. So when I went to college, I went from 170-200 just by eating a ton of crappy dorm food and lifting. I didn't really have a plan or goals, I just lifted. Because I was so skinny and had never done any sort of weight training before, even the un-targeted effort worked. Took me about a 12-18 months to get to 200 though. Then I kinda fell off the lifting wagon and quickly lost a lot of muscle and dropped to a skinny-fat 190.

About a year ago (3 years after I last lifted), I did Rippetoe's starting strength for 6 weeks to get back in the hang of things. Made it to 200lbs while cutting some of my fat just by doing that program and eating a ton of protein packed foods. I meandered through workouts trying to find a good ""intermediate/advanced"" routine for about 2 months and didn't really gain much, but didn't lose much. 

Then I found the holy grail. I did 2 ""cycles"" of Wendler's 5/3/1 Boring But Big variation with a decent amount of auxiliary lifts after the main ones. I blew up from 200 to 230 and hit the 1000lb. club (1000 combined squat, bench, deadlift max) in about 6 months with just protein and creatine supplements while eating a lot and drinking tons of milk (not GOMAD levels, but 2-3 gallons a week).

I plateaued there and I switched up workouts to fight the stagnation now, but I'll probably go back to BBB this summer. By far the hardest part is getting enough calories to meaningfully gain when you have a high metabolism, check out /r/gainit for some good info on that aspect of bulking up."

Did America engage in realpolitik in regards to supporting strongmen who  backed us up against the Soviets? Sure. But those people were leaning towards socialist leaders in the first place. So, America saw it as the lesser of two evils. Once again, if those people protested for democracy like people did in the Middle East in recent times, we would have supported the people.

CS 302- for someone with no prior knowledge of comp sci, it was very difficult for me. I put in long hours of hard work to do well in that class. I found the exams to be the hardest part, as some questions you can't study for, you just have to reason through them. For the programs, they are a lot of work, but as long as you start early on them and get them done, they can save your grade. As far as professors, I'm assuming Deb Deppler is still teaching, however I got a grad student instructor who I did not pick, but it was fine.

math 234- depends on your professor and ability to think in 3D, but for me personally this class was a walk in the park. I got an easy professor (Tanghai Yang) and the content came naturally to me. 

EMA 201- I really enjoyed this class. If you do ALL the homework, understand HOW to do the homework, you should do well. I had Plesha (the guy who wrote it) and it was very fair and I learned a lot.

ME 231- if you're easily able to think in 3D, this class should be no problem. However, I know people who really struggled with this class. In my opinion (and please take my opinion with a grain of salt), this is one of those classes that should give you a good idea of if you're naturally good at 3D visualization, a key factor in whether you will succeed in engineering. Not to say someone who gets a C in the class can't be a great engineer.

edit: forgot one :)
MSE 350- dumb class, didn't feel like I learned much. Dr Jay is a pretty crappy teacher, but he knows his stuff, I'll give him that. I went to lectures, slept through most of them, got the homework answers from a word document passed around from student to student, crammed for all of the exams the night before, and did fine. The one positive thing I will say is that it's a very non time-consuming class comparatively, which is nice. "

We have good preventatives for disease and pregnancy, we can build better relationships with our peers than just ownership bonds. We can fool around and flirt without losing our loves, if we only knew how to understand jealousy as a response to a fear of being betrayed or alone.

If your lover isn't breeding with someone else behind your back, if they're not abandoning you - then actually, factually, logically understand your motivations for jealousy - and they'll generally fade away. Mine did. 

I've got a trio of loving partners, each with their own interests and lovers and friends and a gaggle of friends of my own, some of them friends with-sometimes-benefits. Safe sex is the norm and social taboos and feelings and mores are discussed openly and honestly; feelings are given air time and everyone is heard. 

It's not impossible to do, and it's not unreasonable to think a lot of problems are solved with open communication and better mores and norms revolving around jealousy and ownership and competition for people's love."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389388459.0,"&gt;  if I can get a better rate by using a cosigner, why wouldn't I

I don't mean any offense with this reply.

You've proven to your own satisfaction - mine too - that you are a person who can run up debts you can't pay.   Circumstances have changed; you see that they can.  They could change again.  You could lose your job.  You could contract a dread disease.  A lot of things could happen.

In any of those cases, now your cosigner is on the hook for this loan.  They have to pay it all, now.  They may not be able to get their own home loan because they've signed on yours.  This person trusts you; now they're blindsided, because they didn't understand what they were agreeing to.  (No offense, but if they really understood, they wouldn't do it; they wouldn't help you buy more home than a bank thinks you can afford.)  This kind of thing ruins relationships.  It ruins lives.  

Banks are horrible.  They are rotten scoundrels.  They loan people WAY more money than they ought to.  Their standards are the lowest.  A bank is telling you that it doesn't want to loan you a certain amount of money on good terms: and that's what they're telling you when they ask you to get a cosigner; another way of putting it would be saying ""No.  We won't loan it to you.  Go away; we want to loan this money to a rich person, not you.  If you can find a rich person, we'll loan the money to him, instead.""

* Hot AND humid. No shit, right? At some point, you just get tired of sweating every time you go outside for any amount of time.

* Racism. If you're white (like me), you get blamed for everything that's wrong with Hawaii -- high rate of poverty among natives, lack of jobs for aforementioned natives, the annexation of Hawaii by the US over 100 years ago, imprisoning their Queen.... And its 100x worse as a kid in public school (like I was). Walk down the hallway at school and meet other kids' gazes at your own expense. It will result in yells of ""what the fuck you looking at, haole?!"" and quite often physical violence. And I'm a girl

* Expensive. Sweet baby Jesus, everything's so expensive.

* Poor wages. Counterintuitive, but you get paid less than your counterparts on the mainland because, ""lucky you live Hawaii.""

* Terrible, terrible public schools. I remember my mother being horrified that my 10th grade English teacher spoke Pidgin in class.

* Small. Oh so small. As in everyone knows everyone else. I go back to visit and even today I get asked how my boyfriend is doing. The boyfriend I broke up with 2 decades ago.

This pisses me off more than any other of the usual unsubstantiated/able nonsense. There is no institution more ancient and venerable than the family and it is the most truly anarchist institution, it predates, transcends, and supersedes the state.

But I get it. It's muh patriarchy. Because having a father is such a horrible thing, and yet they don't bat an eye to decry the injustice of abandonment by fathers in poor communities, which, incidentally, has had a tax incentive since the Great Society machination. A dysfunctional family does not invalidate the family.

The state may pretend to justify itself through ""caring"" for the individual from cradle to grave and forming the individual socially, but every task it pretends to do is actually done by the family."

My point was not that anything I said should be taken as truth, but that there are a variety of perspectives that can be taken.  From a pragmatic perspective, it makes sense to adopt a perspective that advances your goals in life.  If your goal is to feel shitty and afraid all the time, then a doom-and-gloom perspective is definitely the way to go.  If, as the posters above indicated, that is not something they find fulfilling, then adopting a perspective that allows for a little more positivity would seem the logical choice."

JonnyRichter,Conservative,1389388740.0,"&gt;Are you then absolutely against late-term abortions?

Yes. This is where I draw the line. I personally think it is the least arbitrary point in which to consider something ""alive.""

&gt;No. They're not. They're identifiably human and identifiably from another unique human.

And this is where we disagree. As I see it, anything the woman does to her own body at this point affects those cells, which makes them an extension of herself. The point at which they can be removed and survive (7 or more months, like you said) is when they are their own being. Seven months seems a long enough time to make that decision. 

&gt;as the mother made the choices to place that human there and should now live with the consequences.

There are two problems with this line of thinking: 

First, victims of rape do not make this choice. It is an act of aggression on them. 

Second, if you force someone, who cannot support themselves very well - let alone another human being - into having a child, then you put a strain on society (transferring those consequences to everyone around her) while simultaneously setting that child up for failure. If the person who ""engaged in this behavior"" is poor and uneducated, you open the door to increase the number of people in the world with low potential for gaining human capital. People, who IMO, probably shouldn't be breeding in the first place.

nahfoo,AskReddit,1389388803.0,"Story time, Mine is Chad the Bowler although I have no clue what his real name is.

Year is 2010, me and 2 roommates are HUGE Against Me! fans, we get tickets to see a show in a town about 4 hours away, starts at 8pm I work until 2:30, Ok no problem, roommates A and B are supposed to pick me up after work and head up to see the show. Come 3:00 I get a call that A's clutch burned out about 2 miles away and they're waiting for roommate C(not an against me fan) to grab B's truck and tow us into a more safe parking lot while A's brother comes to meet us in the parking lot and let us borrow their dads van.
 By the time he gets there and we're back on the road again its after 4 IIRC. Just a little set back no problem.We make it to the freeway and get maybe fifteen minutes out then B says ""hey A where are the tickets?""(I had mine with me) after some talking it turns out they had left them at home. We decide to turn around which will set us back at LEAST an hour at this point I'm a little upset, We decide it isn't worth it we should just stay home and drink beer. Until the last minute. Right as we pull up to the house I suggest we haul ass up there and maaybe we'll see the end of the show. They grab the tickets and we haul ass out of there, doing 100mph a good amount of the way,trying to calculate exactly what time we'd be getting there, we call the venue and he said Aganst Me! would be on around 9 or 9:30.

We arrived at 10 quickly found a parking spot and ran inside, the doorman informs us that they hadn't even started playing yet but they were up next! Perfect timing. We go to a merch table and start hanging out with these dudes from this other band,vampirates I think they were called, who spraypaint their a stencil of their logo on A and B's shirts. fifteen minutes after we talk in Against me! starts, they play loud and hard and I had the best time.
Show is over a little before midnight, we decide to explore downtown for about an hour, talking about the show and enjoying the sights before deciding to head back. We get back to the van which was right across the street from the venue.We're about to get in and this dude in his early 20's runs up and stops us ""Hey do you guys have a phone I can use? I accidentally left my credit card in there with an open tab and the doors are locked, I don't want to get charged for it"" So I let him use my phone to call the venue, No answer. We end up talking to this guy for a while and SOMEHOW he works into the conversation that he has the record for some specific bowing tournament in that town and he fucking loves bowling. This guy also seemed to be on a first name basis with EVERYONE that walked by, why he chose to use our phones I'm not sure.
An acquaintance of his walked by and ""Chad"" explains his situation, the guy suggests he check the side door in the alley as it might still be open. He asks us to go with him in case its closed he can try to call them again and we agree.
We round the corner and see a tour bus, outside of the bus is Tom Gabel (the lead singer of against me!) and the vampirates  just hanging out with only 2 other people (fans). This guy is my fucking idol I am beyond stoked at this point. We run up and talk to him, shake his hand,talk to him about music etc etc until eventually he decided to retire back to the bus to get some sleep.At this point chad had found an open door and went inside and gotten his credit card so its just us and the Vampirates.We chitchat with them for a little while and it turns out they weren't even supposed to be playing that night, They were practicing in some park and thee film students gave them $20 to go away because they needed it to be quiet. the band wandered around until they saw an Against Me! tour bus so they decided to stop and play a AM! cover outside the bus and when Tom heard it he came out and asked them to open.. If that didn't happen we would have easily missed the show.
We say our goodbyes and grab a bite to eat before leaving town around 2 all excited about the night we just had. We stopped and smoked a little bit before continuing on our way. I was laying down in the back of the van, deep in conversation when I noticed it seemed like the trees were passing a little slow for being on the freeway. I sat up and looked at the speedometer which read 30MPH, pointed it out and had a good laugh..That's pretty much the end of the story

kratosgranola,asktrees,1389388862.0,"&gt;So, if I understand correctly, the bowl part that the marijuana goes into is called a slide?

When using a bong, yes. In a (spoon)glass pipe, the part that the marijuana goes into is just referred to as the bowl. some people will call the whole pipe a bowl, too.

&gt;My understanding so far is 14mm and 18mm for the diameters on the lip of the bowl, correct?

The 14mm and 18mm refer to the size of the glass-on-glass adapter connecting the bottom of the slide to the bong. If by ""lip of the bowl"" you were referring to the top of the slide where the weed would be when full, then I should tell you, the diameter of that part of the slide isn't the one that's measured.

&gt;The product I have currently would not be exposed to flames in normal use but are there particular materials that I should avoid using in the creation of the product? Brass? Copper?

As far as I know, there's no material that is toxic to marijuana just from contact. I know Aluminum is bad if there's flame involved, but that's all I've heard.

&gt;On the subject of airflow, if there was a hole created in the middle of the bowl towards the downstem (this makes the contents of the bowl look a bit like a doughnut). Would that be an ideal situation for airflow? Would this cause an issue in smoking?

actually, I've already tested this idea! a couple of my friends had a particular slide that happened to have a mostly cylinder-shaped bowl(this is not common, most bowls are more cone-shaped) that was probably an inch deep. We were trying to save money at the time so we were buying lower quality weed. It was cheap but we got a lot of it, so we always wanted to fit as much as we could into the bowl. We'd accidentally pack it too tight and have troubles with airflow, so I hatched an idea to pack the bowl with a toothpick in the center. We packed it as tight as we could with the toothpick in the center, then pulled the pick out. Worked like a charm, if anything, it worked too well! The airflow was so great that the ember would roll down the hole until half the bowl was burning orange. If it got out of hand we just snuffed it out. It worked well but we didn't have an efficient way to set it up so we stopped.

I'll check it out, and happy to help!"

no-charisma,prolife,1389388956.0,"&gt; A severely disabled person can't decide whether he or she want's to live or not. So, we're basically making the decision for them and forcing them to live when on their own they're naturally just die.

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt here because we can't ever really say this. However, all life, be it plant, animal, fungus, or human, has the desire to live. That is the most basic desire, the very essence of life. I don't think that having down syndrome or autism or anything else really overrides that. People who attempt suicide and fail generally regret it or at least don't immediately try again. And even if they do succeed, they made a conscious choice. My point is that everyone wants to live. Maybe they will have a horrible life, but you can't just rob someone of their only chance to live. Just my 2 cents."
missingamitten,AskReddit,1389388958.0,"I agree with most of your sentiments, I think that religion has contributed (and still is contributing) to the retardation of the forward movement.  I agree that atrocities have been committed (and are still being committed) in the name of religion, by those who are religious, and encouraged by their religious superiors.  I agree that religion ultimately breeds and nurtures ignorance, which has no excuse in modern society and rarely, if ever, contributes anything positive.  I agree with your general viewpoint, I feel the same way.  If all religious people could flip a switch and view the world for what it is (or what I, and I assume, you, think it is) I believe that we would all be much nicer to each other. 

I also believe that the problems caused by religion are caused by people who prioritize their religious beliefs before tangible humanity.  Anyone who oppresses people in the name of their religion is putting their religion before the concerns and needs of a real, live human being.  That, I believe, is the problem.  I know many people who believe in God, but they will still rally with lil' ol' atheist me at the gay pride parades because they agree that the lives of real people are more important than what any ancient book says.  So let them believe whatever they want to believe, as long as they understand that it is a personal belief and should not affect ANYONE other than themselves.  These people are still good people, and are the most effective means of talking sense into the rest of their community.

That being said, the way you are talking to/about someone who is NOT burning witches at the stake, or raping people, or hating on gays, is demonstrating that you are putting YOUR beliefs above basic human decency.  I understand that you lump them all into the same category, and that you probably believe it all starts with the glorification of faith, but that's your own logical fallacy which is easily disproven by the sheer number of religious people who don't fit into the very small, hateful, ignorant box you've drawn for them.  

YOU are the one who needs to learn some tolerance, when to fight your battles, and, for that matter, who to pick them with.  You're the crazy guy with a bomb strapped to your chest trying to make a point, and I'm the guy from the same religion trying to tell you you don't need to do it like this.  "

You have a feature you can implement, but you must charge a premium to make up for all the costs. Not every consumer wants this feature and some won't pay for it and you'll lose the sale even if the cost is amortized out across the entire product.  So, you need two different models or option packs. 

This is pretty typical and has been done on many products for a very long time.  Everyone understands that be it power windows or a bigger engine, you gotta pay to play. 

Where it gets weird is that in some cases, it actually costs you *more* to manufacture two different products than to just put the same thing in every car.  This is because mass production today relies on economies of scale to get the cost of parts down and simplify the production line.   In this case, Tesla has gone with the lowest cost option -- every car gets superchargers -- but if you want that feature enabled, you'll have to pay for it.  "

Alcohol has a very unique property of being able to be both a depressant and, in certain dosages (based on consumer's tolerance) also a stimulant. It can also fuel aggressive tendencies. Sometimes it fuels melancholy. So quite frankly, a substance that promotes more dramatic emotions - anger, desire, sadness - is quite well suited for emotionally impactful works.

By contrast, other more ""uplifting"" drugs like marijuana or an endorphin rush from runner's high tend to put people (at the time) in a more positive, engaging, sometimes critical and objectively analytical frame of mind (seeing objects in a more platonic view).

SoulardSTL,investing,1389389149.0,"Note that the S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000, and many other indexes did drop during the near-capitulation that was 2008... 

When considering index funds, note that they do not offer investments directly in the indexes themselves. One cannot buy directly into an index, which serves more as a guide to broader market considerations. S&amp;P does not offer direct investments into the indexes they oversee. 

What companies like Vanguard do is recreate an index on their own and manage accordingly. Their performance will not match 100% to the broader indexes, either, due to factors such as compounding dividend growth, that are not taken into consideration by, say, the S&amp;P 500 performance reported in the daily media. 

Reference: Check out the performance of the S&amp;P 500 on Yahoo! Finance: ^GSPC (finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EGSPC); Yahoo's a great resource for all things investment-related.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389389149.0,"I think the problem is people don't realize how prevalent steroid use is, especially when it comes to testosterone. 

In that first picture, it's definitely doable to achieve for a small window of time, but it's freakishly difficult to do. To achieve that w/o enhancements is unbelievably hard to do. To put that into perspective, Brad Pitt on fight club was as peak as a human can possibly be w/o roids, and he had the worlds greatest trainers and consultants around him all day. He even would refuse drinking all day to ensure he remained as cut as possible during fight scenes. What Pitt did was not a reasonable lifestyle. 

That being said, I'd still argue that his ""pre roid"" picture isn't pre enhancement. I use test and occassionally tren and I'm closer to the ""pre roid"" look. Many many many people use roids not to get big, but to get ripped. Getting big is a decision, not a result of roid use. Some people want the large look and go that route, while others do not. Like I said, you'd be surprised at how many people use test. When I got on TRT after an injury I had to buy from a local gym guy because 50 bucks is a whole lot cheaper than 250 bucks that the pharma companies wanted me to pay. He pointed out people that bought off him one day, and it ranged from 6'2 200 pound military dude who you'd never assume needed roids, to the treamdill junky that wanted the weight cutting benefits of steroids.

stillakilla,AskMen,1389389215.0,"When I was in high school, it was the last class of the last day before winter break and most of the kids had left the state to visit family or were just skipping to their other teachers since our teacher wasn't the nicest. 


There was a total of 5 students in the class, including myself, a good friend, a super cute girl I had a crush on and two other kids that were sleeping. 


I sat near the front of the class and was turned partially around in my desk talking to my buddy about what we should do for break, cracking jokes and having a good conversation. 


So with about 5 minutes left before we were dismissed, the cute girl walked over from her desk that was in the back of the room and sat in the desk right in front of mine. 


Looking back I realized she probably wanted me to include her in the conversation since she was laughing at what I was saying and staring at me while I was talking but when I look back at what I did I cringe so hard. 


I actually took my desk and turned it around to face my friend so that my back was completely turned toward her because I felt l uncomfortable that she was trying to include herself.

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1389389217.0,"Get a tape measure and measure the space between the front and back bolts, it should be 14"" for a regular size deck.  This is called the wheel base, if you are confused just google ""skateboard wheel base"" or something like that.  

Also, measure the width of the deck, along with the length.  A skateboard is usually between 7.5 and 8.5 for standard sizes, there are wider decks for people who prefer old school style tricks and pools, which are 8.5 and up, and below 7.5 is mostly childrens boards.  

My guess is that your old deck was a bit smaller than 7.5 and you got used to it after riding it so long...

FountainsOfFluids,videos,1389389350.0,"You have no concept of a self perpetuating cycle, do you?

Also, the economy has been exporting all those jobs you think people should be growing toward. For many of those people there simply is nowhere for them to grow toward. Anything else has requirements that they have no ability to meet. Sure, some can use that job as a stepping stone and move on. All those minimum wage jobs were really intended for teenagers to use for a little extra spending cash. But that's not the world we live in anymore. You really think that mothers and fathers would be working there trying desperately to make ends meet if they had the capacity to move on to better jobs? Even if they do take on extra jobs, there are only so many hours in a week.

You are assuming that everybody is like you and has the same situation and capabilities that you do. That is solipsism of the highest order. All you have to do is look at the real world and people who are stuck in those entry level jobs for years and years to know that it simply isn't true for everyone else.

&gt; Keep up personal appearance, treat people with respect and kindness (no matter how you're treated,) and put as much effort into your work as possible. The day I see that on a regular basis at Walmart is the day I'll stop shopping there.

Also, I convinced all my coworkers at the bank I used to work at that one of our regular customers had a wooden leg, that he had lost the original one in a wood chipper accident, and that the wooden leg he had now was made from the tree he was wood chipping at the time. He had a little bit of a limp, so it was more believable. I said that he didn't like to talk about it and told it to me in confidence, so he might not like it if they said anything about it.

Do you know that Batman, the top selling comic for November of 2013, sold just over 125,000 copies?  And that the comics you're complaining about typically sell between 5,000 and 20,000 copies.

Tell me again why this is an important issue, why this needs to be addressed?  Why it *matters* if some creators in the comic industry cater to male fantasies about sexy women and powerful dudes?

Because it doesn't.  This is non-relevant to anything.  This argument exists not because comics and saucy comic art and pin-up babes are important or relevant.  It exists because there are elements in our society that *hate* male sexuality and want to see everything that appeals to men specifically destroyed."

professor__doom,Automate,1389389553.0,"This is possibly the stupidest argument I have ever heard.  Allow me to offer some excerpt's from Henry Hazlitt's classic 1946 tract, ""Economics in One Lesson:""

&gt;The belief that machines cause unemployment, when held with
any logical consistency, leads to preposterous conclusions. Not only
must we be causing unemployment with every technological improve-
ment we make today, but primitive man must have started causing it
with the first efforts he made to save himself from needless toil and
sweat.

Hazlitt reduces the fear that technology will create suffering and unemployment to the absurdity that it is:

&gt;If it were indeed true that the introduction of labor-saving
machinery is a cause of constantly mounting unemployment and mis-
ery, the logical conclusions to be drawn would be revolutionary, not
only in the technical field but for our whole concept of civilization.
Not only should we have to regard all further technical progress as a
calamity; we should have to regard all past technical progress with
equal horror. Every day each of us in his own capacity is engaged in
trying to reduce the effort it requires to accomplish a given result.  Each of us is trying to save his own labor, to economize the means
required to achieve his ends. Every employer, small as well as large,
seeks constantly to gain his results more economically and effi-
ciently—that is, by saving labor. Every intelligent workman tries to cut
down the effort necessary to accomplish his assigned job. The most
ambitious of us try tirelessly to increase the results we can achieve in
a given number of hours. The technophobes, if they were logical and
consistent, would have to dismiss all this progress and ingenuity as not
only useless but vicious. Why should freight be carried from New
York to Chicago by railroads when we could employ enormously
more men, for example, to carry it all on their backs?

He comes up with a couple very logical conclusions: that ""employment"" is merely the means to an end--namely, the production of the goods and services that we need to support (and enjoy) our lives.  Anything that reduces the labor necessary toward this end is inherently a good thing.

He also offers data from many historic examples, from the 18th through 20th centuries, of situations where technological advancement and process automation created short-term unemployment in a particular industry, but lead to long-term gains for society as a whole--and sometimes long-term INCREASES in employment in the very industry most affected.

&gt;It is a misconception to think of the function or result of
machines as primarily one of creating jobs. The real result of the
machine is to increase production, to raise the standard of living, to
increase economic welfare. It is no trick to employ everybody, even (or
especially) in the most primitive economy. Full employment—very full
employment; long, weary, back-breaking employment—is characteristic of precisely the nations that are most retarded industrially. Where
full employment already exists, new machines, inventions, and discoveries cannot—until there has been time for an increase in population—bring more employment. They are likely to bring more unemployment (but this time I am speaking of voluntary and not involuntary unemployment) because people can now afford to work fewer hours, while children and the overaged no longer need to work.

&gt;What machines do, to repeat, is to bring an increase in production
and an increase in the standard of living.

You can download ""Economics in One Lesson"" here: http://mises.org/books/economics_in_one_lesson_hazlitt.pdf

I highly recommend reading chapters 7, 8, and 10, since they are particularly relevant to the issues discussed here.  I disagree--sometimes quite strongly--with some of his other conclusions, especially regarding tariffs, unions, and his critique of Keynesianism in general.  But he is an excellent writer, and I believe he hits the nail right on the head when he makes the distinction between employment and production.

JordanLeDoux,PoliticalDiscussion,1389389705.0,"&gt;If people choose to participate in a collective of some sort, isn't it better for that to be a choice rather than compulsory?

&gt;How much of your daily life are you able to manage without the use of violence and why do you believe that it violence is necessary in other parts of your life?

How did either of those questions come up? I didn't say anything about those. Morals are by definition subjective value judgments. Ethics are by definition actions/behaviors that minimize the objective negatives of a particular social interaction. Governments can be ethical, but they cannot be moral, tautologically. 

&gt;In essence, I am agreeing with you that we can never have a moral state because power over others necessarily requires a lack of ethics.

That isn't what I was saying at all. As I said, you are enormously confused about what ethics and morals are.

&gt;What is the point of having power over others if you can not make a rule and then exempt yourself from that rule?

I would suggest going to codeacademy.com and going through their Javascript course (very similar to C#) - you'll end up with a firm grasp of basic programming concepts and you'll be ale to use them with Unity almost instantly since you can use JS scripts.

Good luck!

slockley,AskReddit,1389389875.0,"&gt; The number of potential gods is infinite, so the ""chances of getting there"" are almost none -- that is to say, probability zero.

Definitely not zero.  There are necessarily finite gods in the list of possible candidates, and the payoff is, in some cases, infinitely valuable.  Infinity multiplied by any nonzero number is still infinity.

&gt; Unless there is a god, but it's the god who punishes believers and rewards nonbelievers.

This is a conceptual possibility.  Still, to my knowledge, no belief system in existence truly accepts this premise.

So if you think the existence of a God who punishes believers and rewards nonbelievers offers an infinite-value reward for your nonbelief, who necessarily has revealed mistruths to mankind (otherwise, no one could believe in a god who did not reveal himself to man, and all would be rewarded) for the purpose of tricking some into believing in a god with different qualities than that god (though are still held guilty of belief), is more likely than any of the existing belief systems, then you're applying the wager correctly.

YOUR_VERY_STUPID,ModestMouse,1389389946.0,"In my opinion, at least, it partially refers to what's most accurately called post-theism, which is basically saying that God is an obsolete concept, something that humans once needed to understand the nature of reality but no longer needed. I haven't really ever read Nietzsche, but I believe this is similar to his idea of the death of God.

This explains the first part- God exists in the same sense that any imagined thing exists, as a concept in the minds of humans. This is just like every other thing humans have invented that isn't real, like, say, unicorns. At a certain point, that concept is slowly removed from cultures as our understanding of the nature of existence becomes more complete.

The second part, I think, more specifically refers to the Christian God, who is an important leitmotif in Brock's lyrics. God is ordinarily portrayed in his work as an uncaring entity that just says ""deal with your own problems"" (Styrofoam Boots), just a regular guy who happens to be God (Jesus Christ Was An Only Child). This is a little more negative, more on the level of being angry at a god that's believed to exist but doesn't fix all the problems in the world. I think it's Brock's way of saying ""God is a dick, he'll ruin your life before society kills him."""

LOLextraHard1234,pebble,1389390002.0,"I understand the marketing reasons for logo branding on products and their placements for maximum exposure.  

It could be a small cost for most folks but from a UI perspective, it can be distracting because most of the logos on, say on monitors/TVs, seem to be relatively high-contrast typeface.  For the Pebble Steel, they at least subdued the logo somewhat.  However, logos on the front face of watches are harder to read because sleeves and cuffs may obscure it and the fact that wristwatches are small; people are probably more likely to inquire about the device if they are curious and observant, as well as the fact that these fancy watches are a nascent category of actually useful gadgetry.

For the Apple laptops with the glowing logo on the back, some folks like to cover it up with decals or cases.  And many people that use iPhones utilize cases that cover the logo up anyway, although sometimes you see the cases that expose the logo I suppose for status-symbol reasons.  I'm sure the Apple debated whether or not to place a small logo on the front face because of the cases... After all, most smartphones have logos on the front that are oftentimes unobscured by cases."

* Fiesta Bowl - 18+ hours - not going
* Cotton Bowl - 8 hours - going
* Sugar Bowl - 12 hours - going
* Peach Bowl - 12 hours - going
* Orange Bowl - 20+ hours - not going

The same thing goes for the title game.  Jerry Dome - going.  Pheonix - not going.

Basically, I figure if I don't have to buy plane tickets I can afford actual tickets.  Split gas with my dad traveling and it all works out.

I actually *did* go to the library to study and hang out in her room.  But the issue was that I was a complete dork in high school and went off to college with zero confidence.  I was totally into Becky, but just thought she was *completely* out of my league.  So the idea that she might actually be into me - despite the blatantly obvious signs - just was never on my radar.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1389390352.0,"I'm usually approached while I'm shopping. Most notably while I was Christmas shopping for my dog.

Strangely enough that got us talking about our pets, then our funny pet stories, had more than a few laughs and eventually his number. So yeah I almost got his number but I'm happily in a relationship. He was cool about it.  

Then there was Christmas shopping for my boyfriend at Kohl's. I couldn't decide which cologne to buy him and the guy next to me gave his opinion. We talked for maybe 30 minutes about how hard it is to shop, the Christmas rush, what cologne he should try, and he ended up purchasing the cologne I thought was nice. He tried on every cologne just to give me a better opinion for my gift - they all smelled pretty damn good to me. 

I was shopping at fresh market (similar to Whole Foods) and couldn't decide which beer looked good. I was out of my depth with this one but the guy next to me was awesome. He brewed his own beer, had all this extensive knowledge on beer, and we just had this long conversation about alcohol, bottle branding, and plans for that weekend.  So yeah, it's possible to be successfully hit on at the alcohol section of a supermarket.

I was commiserating with the guy next to me while we were waiting to be checked out at Walmart. He started a funny conversation about what items he was buying. No kidding - he had duct tape, a padlock, knives, a shovel, gloves, and a pack of beer. So many laughs over that. Said I should join him for a beer hahaha. 

I was buying a bookcase at Target and the cashier started a conversation about Legend of Zelda after he noticed my wallet. No one was coming into the lane so he asked about the bookcase, which naturally went to what books I'm interested in and before I realize it we've been talking for almost 10-15 minutes. I talk a lot when I'm shopping apparently. Aaaand he slipped a Kvothe quote into the conversation. That's cool. 

Anyways, that's how I'm usually approached.

You're profiling, and connecting the dots based on assumption without fact.  You have still not acknowledged that there are *many* people who are religious, that stand up for human rights--even alienating their families, churches and communities in the process.

I just finished it last night  and really liked it. However, the second half of the book felt kinda slow and dull, an endless cycle of Richard getting drunk, falling asleep, waking up and so on, again and again. I guess I was expecting some sort of a breakthrough, but it didn't come and the ending disappointed me a bit. It was anticlimatic.
As to remorse, Richard in several moment says he felt pain at the thought of Bunny, when it occured to him what they really did and he even thinks something like 'Jesus, Bun, I'm sorry'. I don't know about others, they were all very selfish people, very focused on themselves, but some of them also got the nightmares with Bunny, so it may suggest that they felt some remorse.
As to Henry. He is fascinating in the beginning, but then, as the plot develops, he is stripped of these layers that made him attractive and more and more of his rotten core is revealed and at the end I thought he was just a pretentious asshole, playing with lives of other people and having no respect for absolutely anything. I don't think there was more to him and Julian except this psycho-fan blind admiration Henry had for Julian. I also was puzzled about Julian's reaction; maybe he was afraid that it will be revealed that he was some kind of spiritus movens of the Bacchanal and he didn't want to be connected to his student in case it all come out. (I had a teacher exactly like Julian in high school, btw. And I may or may not have been behaving like Henry to him. Oh well.)
Uhh, the Twins. I feel as you do: WTF. I didn't see it coming, they were shown as the most innocent people, at least at the beginning. I think Tartt went over the top with this, as well as with everyone sleeping with everyone, it was just too much and it stripped the book of it's mysterious heavy aura, instead making it melodramatic. Henry's and Charles' actions in the last chapters are just ridiculous.

thiscommentisdumb,AskReddit,1389390469.0,"Know this is gonna get buried, don't care. Still want to tell the story for me if nobody else. I started questioning my faith when I was 13 or 14. I still went to church because it made my mom happy for me to do it. The whole thing just didn't really make a whole lot of sense to me, personally.

When I was 18, my mom started to get sick. I remember the day like it was yesterday. We were hanging out watching TV and she started to complain that her back hurt. Over the course of a couple hours, it got so bad that we had to call an ambulance. This was early April. She was a breast cancer survivor and I had been told that it was caught early and she was fine now. Come to find out the pain in her back was Leukemia. Nobody had caught it in the checkups she'd had after her chemotherapy. Really caught us all by surprise. By the middle of May she was dead. She was the nicest lady. Everybody loved her. There were over 200 people at her funeral.

Now I'm pissed. What the fuck? She was fine! All the assholes in the world and she's the one that has to go? Anyway, enter my pastor. I've known the guy as long as I've been alive. Spent a lot of time around him growing up and really looked up to him. After the funeral, literally *right* after the funeral, he comes and tries to collect his payment from my dad. Really, dude? The guy *just* put his wife of 25 years in the ground. This can't wait 'til tomorrow? *This asshole* is the guy who's supposed to be in charge of making sure my eternal soul is saved? Fuck. All. That. The whole thing is bullshit. I rage quit organized religion that day. Some other stuff has happened in the ensuing decade to reinforce that I made the right decision."

Not necessarily true. There are people who died thousands of years ago who we remember today. Of course, there are many more who died and we *don't* remember - again, if you're dead, and there is no heaven, you cannot care about your legacy. You cannot think ""2000 years later, and nobody remembers me, how horrible!"" You're just dead.

I was still eating like I was used to though so I gained about 70 lbs. 

It took about two years to fully recover from the infection I had and then I immediately got pregnant. I didn't gain any weight but remained overweight. I am now breastfeeding and back to eating a ton of food but learned how to eat only when hungry. I don't want to diet and risk milk supply but when I start the weaning process I will do so."

And while I agree that high frequency is extremely effective, I wish he gave more concrete workouts to follow. The problem with letting people pick their own high frequency programs is the same as letting people pick their own volume. Most will invariably do way too much. With high volume, you'll probably just take longer to recover and inflame your shit. With high frequency though, you're going to seriously risk overreaching and finally overtraining(not to mention serious injury). For example, take Kelei's recent routine. It's very high frequency and a great program but Kelei allows people to run it however they see fit in the spirit of autoregulation and people are crashing and burning because they're doing a full body 6 times a week. Same goes for 2x a day training. Extremely effective if done correctly but I never recommend it because most people are going to way overdo it.

JordanLeDoux,PoliticalDiscussion,1389391006.0,"What in the world are you talking about?

I reject the premise of your questions. Different people *have* different morals, ergo, morals are subjective. Ethics do not consider right and wrong explicitly, they consider the benefit and detriment of a type of interaction, and behaviors that maximize and minimize those.

Whether or not it is right to initiate force against others is an ethical question, not a moral one. 

You also seem to have no idea what subjectivism is either. Subjectivism is not about rationalization or semantics. Subjectivism is about the *reality* that everyone has a different set of circumstances, experiences and views that culminate in different abstractions of what they believe to be moral. A subjectively held moral can be unethical (and therefore unacceptable to society) but it cannot be immoral if that person genuinely finds the behavior to be moral.

That is why our governments and laws are based on ethics, not morals, and why governing by moral judgment (such as with gay marriage for instance in the United States) is a destructive thing for society to do. Because morals can be unethical, and unethical behaviors are socially inefficient.

EDIT:

This might help: an immoral person is a person who literally does things they believe are wrong. An immoral action is an action that is against the morals that you hold, but it is only immoral in the context of those morals.

Whether or not it is unethical is not (as) subjective."

robiannelli,drunk,1389391063.0,"I will provide a source.  But for now alot of body builders cut out carbs drastically before competitions to reduce body fat and make there muscles show.  They have sticks (similer to pregnancy tests) that they pee on to make sure they do not fall on ketosis. Simple carbs (not complex carbs) are very important to your diet.  Brown rice, vegtables, some starches. 

 Humans are omnivores and we need an array of nutrients.  Vegetarianism, vegan, no carbs, soup diets, are all very unhealthy.  My best advice is to cook all of your meals.  Skip frozen stuff and take-out.  Healthy fats work as lubricants for your joints, carbs help to regulate blood sugar, and meat protien is very important for healthy skin and muscles.  Dont listen to people saying cooking veg makes it loose its vitamins.  Whatever vitamins are lost in cooking are nothing compared to how cooking makes the vitamins that are left more easily absourbed.

hookedOnOnyx,MtF,1389391106.0,"&gt; There is nothing to feel guilty for by trying to be honest to yourself.

I wish I could say that, but in her view I'm not trans, I'm just depressed. Or even if I am trans, I should just be able to deal with it. She told me this story of a trans woman who lived in the 1940s and was married and had kids. Even though she knew she wasn't really a man, there wasn't much she could do about it. She remained a man, expressing herself through outlets like crossdressing. The point of the story, I guess, was that I should find outlets instead of changing my life, but that feels horrifyingly demeaning. How can I compartmentalize myself? What does that even mean? If I just go on living as my birth gender, won't the dysphoria just get worse? That's what I've read and that's what my therapist tells me.

&gt; Because she's afraid. She's probably also hurt and a little angry.

She has every right to be. I'm terrified. I also think she uses any fear or doubt I have to eviscerate me. She doesn't want to lose the person she married, but she's pushing me away so hard. How can I be so certain? How can I explain it? Why can't I just find some other outlet? Why do I need to transition? What's going to happen? Why can't I just be normal?

There are times when I feel such a relief at just admitting I'm trans. It feels right. I have hope for the future. But there's no hope right now. I'm just so ashamed that this all happened so suddenly, seemingly out of the blue. How is that even possible?! Haven't most trans people been dealing with this their entive lives? I feel like if I can't prove it's real then I have to remain a man, and that thought just plunges me into despair."

BarneseyBoo,AskReddit,1389391112.0,"I'll tell this in as short a way as I can - I was baptized and raised Protestant-ish (my parents weren't very stringent, but my grandmother was).  I went to Catholic school for high school, but this was in San Francisco where while they made you go to Mass at school, they also were all about teaching and informing students about other forms of spirituality, which eventually led to me questioning Christianity as the right path and I became agnostic.

A few years later in college, I met my then-soon-to-be-but-now-ex-husband who introduced me to a group that facilitates and preserves Native American spirituality (it's a particular teaching, so I won't go into super specifics other than to say it introduced me to sweat lodges.)  

It was really beautiful to experience, and that, plus my budding relationship with the person I was certain was my soulmate, led to me becoming a part of the group for nine years.  

For a few years everything was great, and it was about creating a small space for people to pray safely.  Then several different things started happening: connections on the rez and other factors meant expansion and the creation of a larger, organized, networked group to put on and facilitate larger ceremonies.  It has grown into a larger operation with a cultural center that also requires a great deal in donations to keep running, and a lot of time in volunteering.  There was also a self-righteous, nasty attitude starting to brew among the core group; they were snide and derisive to those who, they felt, weren't putting enough effort and time into the ceremonies and the center - when this was supposed to be a place and a path of acceptance and love.

As of a year ago, I was managing the center and putting at least $100+ into things for the center a month for basic things like electricity (I'm in grad school and was working part time for a bookstore at the time to make ends meet).  When going through receipts one day, I found a bank statement (for the account that the group used to deposit donation checks) showing that it was being used to pay for someone's personal lunch one day, gas for their car another, a trip to Walmart for personal items.  I was appalled that they were using donation money that way, especially this was money that we were supposed to be using for the center or to support people in need out on the rez, not to mention that we were applying for 501c3 status. However, the higher-ups were the ones using the bank card this way.

I was noticing how over-zealous the core group had gotten at this point: nothing mattered but the group, the ceremonies and the center - nothing.  I was told I was being selfish and uncommitted for taking summer classes (which meant I wouldn't be available for several events during our busiest season); I was told I didn't do enough for the center, when I was spending 3-4 full days there a week working, while working 3-4 days a week at the store and taking a full load at school; and I was told my priorities were out of alignment when I couldn't attend an event because it fell on the weekend that I was moving, starting a new semester, and having my divorce hearing.  

It took some time, but after a great deal of soul searching I realized that while the ceremonies are beautiful and helpful to the people who come out to them and participate, I couldn't be a part of a group that could smile and preach one thing and turn around be completely different at its core.  I turned in my keys last April and haven't been back since.  "

The bad part is people can see what's happening to their bike and interact with the mechanic that's working on it.  Sometimes I *really* don't want to explain every single little nuance of a repair job to someone who just won't leave me alone.  Don't get me wrong, I love telling people how these things work, but there is a limit where it just gets annoying and becomes a distraction to the work I'm trying to do.  Also, sometimes you really don't want to see some of the stuff we do.  On some cheaper wheels, sometimes the quickest and easiest way to repair a bent rim is to deliver some well-placed hits to our concrete floor, and then true it the rest of the way in.  I personally don't want to do that in front of customers, otherwise we look like blockheads who fix things by hitting them against the floor.

iheartaegislash,AskReddit,1389391334.0,"Gonna put the TL;DR up here cause this is like a book: Ruined two rolls of photo paper (about $500 a piece) during a second consecutive double shift.

I was a cashier at CVS in high school.

Background: The store was open 24 hours but there was a group of people who worked nights, and a group of people who worked days. Since I was in high school I was 16 (maybe 17) at the time, and worked the day shift. Days were 7am-10pm So when I say double shift, I mean 7am-10pm, 15 hours, two 30 minute breaks ends up being 14 hours total. We also had a photo processing machine that was (is) older than me. It was those old ones where the photo paper can't be exposed to the light so if you had to change the paper you had to stick the old paper, box that held the paper for the machine, and the (lightproof) box holding the new paper into a lightproof bag and without looking change the paper (it's roughly a 15 minute process start to finish once you get good at it, can take upwards of 45 when you first start). Cashiers also ran the photo department, so you did both. The manager at my store was a retired special victim's detective (apparently like law and order, but got pissed if you asked him that) who you didn't want to get pissed off at you.

Story: It was the weekend of grad night and graduation. I was the only cashier *not* graduating that weekend. As such I had to work 2 double shifts, one on Saturday and one on Sunday. About halfway through the second one the paper ran out while I was printing pictures from a set of negatives (yeah people still do get negatives developed) and had to change the paper. I called the manager to cover my register while I changed the paper, and ran to the back to get the box. I changed the paper, only to realize I had grabbed the wrong kind of paper (got matte instead of glossy). Had to re-call the manager and switch everything around to get it fixed, or so I thought.....as the pictures started printing I noticed they hid this slight pink line on one side. I asked my manager, and he just looked at me like oh for f***s sake, and told me I had ruined the roll by exposing it to the light. I don't know what I did, but clearly I goofed. He told me to just run the matte because the customer didn't specify and their order was coming due shortly. Those pictures also had the pink line, and he looked like he was going to throttle me because he had been on the register now for roughly an hour while I ruined two rolls of photo paper (that I later found out cost the store $500 each). A customer came up to the register, and he rang out the customer. After that he took a deep breath calmly looked at me and said ""go take a break. When the next manager shift comes in, they'll cover the register and we'll go to the office and talk."" This was around 12:30, and the next manager got there at 2. The next hour and a half was probably one of the most stressful times of my life. When the next manager came in, I nervously went up to the office. He looked at me and said something along the lines of look, I know this is your second double, and I appreciate you agreeing to work this, but if you're too tired to do the job just have us call another store to see if they'll cover. Those photo paper things cost a lot of money, so if you don't think you can do it, have your manager do it they're all trained on it. If you keep messing this up, I'm going to have to replace you. Let me buy you an energy drink for the rest of your shift though. That energy drink hit the spot, and I didn't ruin another roll of photo paper the whole time I worked there. That manager actually wanted to promote me to a shift lead a few months after that but CVS policy prevents people under 18 being shift leads. :/"

Also, Marvin Harrison doesn't seem to me to have been any more dominant than Bettis was, as the article suggests. Manning was dominant, and therefore Harrison got a *ton* of catches. Harrison didn't start lighting it up until Manning's second year - Harrison's fourth.

Gear isn't too difficult to get a hold of, its just knowing the right guys. Guys who compete, guys in the gym or the internet are the best ways to get gear. Again, it comes down to genetics as well as hard work. You can take all the gear in the world but if you don't put the effort in you won't get as big as this guy.

p3ndulum,poker,1389391423.0,"Start thinking about what things look like from your opponent's perspective.

""What do I want them to think about what my cards are?""

""What can I do to trick them into thinking that I have something different?""

In the beginning, it's easy to get caught up in our own cards and our outs and odds etc and we can get stuck at this level for almost our entire poker career if we're not careful. Beyond that, there's a level of play where you can almost force your opponents into playing their hands ""face up"" which starts with you playing your hand differently than conventional wisdom might suggest that you should.

Call where others might raise. Raise where others might fold. After a while, you'll begin to see how you can slowly build a stack without having much of anything, simply by applying pressure in the right spots because of how accurately you've began to read them - because you've shifted your focus and attention from your own cards and put it on how they are responding to your betting patterns.

Try this: drop down on stakes (to reduce your risk and increase your comfort levels), and instead of thinking about how you should play your cards, start picking hands that you don't have and figure out the most obvious line/betting pattern for that hand and bet like you have that hand.

For example, maybe you flatted a pre-flop raise with something like 98-suited and the flop comes T-5-3.

Say to yourself, ""win or lose, I'm going to play this like I flopped a set.""

You can raise a flop bet or just call and raise the turn. Maybe you get a fold and win a pot with nothing, or maybe you get called all the way down and lose.

If you get a fold, that's a huge win in terms of your equity, but even if you get called down and lose, your table will remember that, and you'll be able to use that impression against them when you actually do flop a set.

Either way, you'll have broken that next-level barrier, and if you keep practicing that and paying close attention to how your opponents are playing in response to you, you should quickly become an excellent hand-reader as well as an extremely dangerous player - one who could have anything at any time and isn't afraid to go outside of the box in an effort to win a pot."

chrunchy,canada,1389391455.0,"3D Printing? IDK about that. It will certainly reduce demand but at no time is 3D printing going to impact *industrial* supply. If a company needs thousands of small spacers, it's going to continue to be most efficient to mould them or stamp them industrially.

Now *retail* supply is going to be affected. If you have a 3D printer and you need a single replacement spacer you're going to have a choice of either sourcing the item (could take days sometimes), buying a package of 50, paying retail markups OR booting up the computer, downloading a file and printing it.

I'm not saying that 3DP is going to be useless - just it's not going to impact the economy so hard or so fast.

Self-driving vehicles do have that ability though - you can replace taxis with a fleet of self-driving cars. Also you can (eventually) replace transport truck drivers, bus drivers, garbage truck drivers (but not loaders) etc. There are some cases where there will be personal service though - a Limo without a driver isn't a good experience.

&gt;Being able to choose your own lifestyle and habits is a privilege. Pursuing an actively fit and thoroughly healthy lifestyle is a privilege - **but on the flip-side, by that logic, so is having the luxury to sit around and do nothing. It’s a privilege to afford 800-calorie Starbucks drinks every day. It’s a privilege to have parents or a family who provide food for you - even if that food isn’t necessarily healthy. It’s a privilege to be able to say, “You know what? I don’t feel like running today, I’m going to do something else with my free time that I’ll enjoy more.” It’s a privilege to scroll through Tumblr for hours and hours with no need to do anything productive.**

&gt;For those of us who are able to make these choices regarding our own health and lifestyle, we have every right to make those choices as we want. Doing so does not oppress, shame, or otherwise harm anyone should they choose differently.

&gt;The way you treat your body is your decision, and yours alone, and if someone else’s healthy habits are offending you, you may need to reconsider the choices you’ve made for yourself. Because in this scenario, the issue is you, not them.

&gt;**(Also, back to Anon’s original post, since I keep finding more and more flaws in their logic. Sharing your life experiences is not oppression. Oppression would be silencing someone from sharing their life experiences because you don’t want to hear about them due to your own insecurities. Zing.)**"

slockley,AskReddit,1389391509.0,"&gt; What about the gods that punish you for believing in other gods?

I have never heard of such a belief system, where a god punishes for believing in other gods, but rewards disbelievers.  Can you provide an example?

&gt; If the number of gods that might react this way is more than 1 then it is better to not believe than to believe in the Christian god.

I disagree.

Disbelief would be a better idea than Christian belief only if (1) the total-sum probability of the existence of a god rewarding disbelievers is greater than the probability that the Christian God exists, or (2) the one true disbeliever-reward is more than proportionally better than the offer of heaven.

Further, for the record, believing in the existence Christian God does not merit heaven.  Satan believes, but rejects God as supreme, for example.  Salvation comes by God's grace through faith of the believer (which itself is bestowed by God) in Jesus' resurrection and deity."

IndependentBoof,AskReddit,1389391795.0,"I have Christian faith... but I'm not ""religious"" in the traditional sense. 

I'll try to keep it brief to a few major points:

**1. I believe in transcendence because it makes more sense to me and is also more comforting.** While I'm a skeptic and a believer in science, I can also see where we might not have the means to observe everything. I accept humility that even with mankind's great progress in observing the world, we know very little of it all.

**2. I believe in Jesus' teaching because it resonates in me.** He not only reinforced ""the golden rule"" but took values of empathy, love, and forgiveness to the extreme. Through his teachings (particularly the *Sermon on the Mount*, Matthew chapters 5-7), I am challenged to exhibit a love that is stoic and unwavering, even to those who may be hard to love. It's a challenge that is difficult, but will make me a better person.

**3. I'm not ""religious"" because religion tends to lose purpose by over-emphasizing the letter of the law.** Particularly, most denominations of Christianity consider the Bible as inerrant and the critical thinker in me can't get on board with that. Instead, I read the Bible (and other spiritual writings) as peoples' insights and experiences with spirituality. Likewise, worship/mass at church tends to be passive: you read what someone else has written for you to pray, someone else delivers a message (sermon), etc. Learning is more effective when you are actively involved so I would like to see churches abandon traditional worship programs and embrace more participatory discussions and activities."

Selling a phone can be sketchy on Craigslist (I know there are other ways online) and as a woman, I don't think I'd want to be dealing with that. Then again, I'd never buy a 64gb iPhone. If I was an apple girl, the 16gb one would be fine. I totally buy into the streaming model for content and have no need to carry around 48gb more content with me. I've got 25gb of free space on my 32gb HTC one. The $282 they offer for a 16gb iPhone 5S makes sense to me, it's trading money for convenience, just like trading in a car rather than trying to sell it yourself.

mikeytag,Bitcoin,1389392252.0,"Most MOTO transactions are probably going to clock in around 2.9% and 20 cents or so. For someone as big as Overstock I would probably venture to guess that they have a rate around 2% and $0.20 for Visa/Mastercard. AMEX and Discover will typically be much higher. The extra $0.20 per transaction adds up quickly and depending on your average ticket size can eat up a significant amount of processing.

For instance, if average order size is $20 and they have a deal for 2% and $0.20 then the actual CC fee for that order is $0.60 which comes out to 3%.

Now, what most merchants don't realize is that their processing banks will usually quote a low rate 1.9% or something, but the fine print says that the rate can be variable due to volume, average order size, etc.  When many merchants look at their actual statement they usually find that the first $100 of the month got the 2% rate and the other $9,000 were charged a 3.95% rate. Many of the advertisements you see are for ""teaser"" rates that can be changed by the processors at will.

I'm sure that Overstock has negotiated much better terms than what I described above, but these types of practices are systemic within merchant account processing and happen to more businesses than you realize."

Frequent service, regular service and limited service are shown using different line widths and styles; Express service and community bus service are shown using different colours.

&gt; * Frequent service, a new category, identifies bus and streetcar routes that operate at 10min or better service, weekdays  from 7am to 10pm and weekends 9am to 7pm. These routes are shown with a thick red line.
* Regular service continues to show bus and streetcar routes that run all day, every day until 1am. These routes are shown with a thin red line.
* Limited service now includes routes previously identified as rush hour only. These routes continue to be shown with a thin red dashed line.
* Express services are now separated out and shown with a thin blue line.
* Community bus service is shown with a thin yellow line. 

**YES.** THANK YOU, BYFORD &amp; CO. That change alone makes this map a vast upgrade, since the thicker lines will denote routes that people can actually depend upon.

As far as the 2x4 / 4x4s go, you can usually find some that are good.  The biggest issue is that after the bunk is opened up, people go and dig through them and aren't very good about laying them flat after they reject them.  So they sit on a fulcrum while they're still a little wet and they start to bow.  If the Lumber associates are on their game they're supposed to go through and flat stack them to prevent this, but many times it doesn't happen.

However you can usually find lots of good pieces if you look for the undisturbed parts of the bunk.  If the bunk is just about empty, you might also be able to get them to drop another bunk for you and that stuff is usually pretty good.

It also depends on when you get to the pile.  If you're not in a hurry, wait a day or two and come back.  During the summer it's pretty likely they've moved to a new bunk and you'll have a bunch of new options.

If I know I'm gonna have some wood for a while before I use it I typically lay it out on a flat surface and weight the ends with a brick or concrete block to keep it from warping as it dries."

Ralkir,changemyview,1389392634.0,"&gt;From a purely natural perspective: I think that animals(human beings included) are instinctively inclined to reproduce for the survival of the species. The best way to accomplish that would be to have multiple mates. Also, from an evolutionary perspective, more mates would mean more DNA combinations and genetic possibilities.

Except from an evolutionary point of view, you don't want more DNA combinations, you just want the genes that will survive. So what does this mean to a person?

Well lets take a man. He finds what in his eyes is the most fit (evolutionary fit) female in the entire human population. Now this man wants his genes to survive. Anyone else mating with this woman would increase the likelihood that the offspring would compete for resources against the man's potential offspring. 

Now we apply this for the woman as well and there you have it, monogamous relationships. While yes from an evolutionary stand point it makes sense to spread your genes far and wide. But it also makes sense to protect good genes from falling into the hands of competitors, so that you can ensure that your offspring are the best in the bunch.  "

2. Turn rates were in Dota1, so they were basically carried over to Dota2.  It adds another level of difficulty, as you have to account for the turn rate AND the animation time of attacks, so you have to be thinking a little farther ahead.  Batrider's sticky napalm slows down opponents' turn rates which can be a big deal too

MattieShoes,DotA2,1389393102.0,"Natural Order isn't magic resistance reduction -- it's magic damage amplification.  I don't know of any actual magic resistance reduction in the game.

EDIT:

So AFAICT, there is no magic resistance reduction in the game because the game doesn't actually calculate your magic resistance, it just runs a series of functions on the base magic damage 

damage = raw * (1-base resist) * (1-hood/pipe/cloak resist) * (1-ability based resist) * (1+damage amp)...

If there was actual resist reducers, it would have to be calculated something like this:

damage = raw * CEILING[(1 + resist_reduction - base_resist - hood/pipe/cloak_resist - ability_based_resist), 0] * (1+damage_amp)

END EDIT

AFAIK, universal damage is affected by magic damage amplification.  The only magicky damage that I know of that isn't affected by amplification is pure and HP Removal.  

Pretty sure Ice Vortex works with March of Machines.  I can't say I've actually tested it though... All magic resist/amplification should work with it, just not magic immunity... So there's a distinction here between immunity and 100% resistance.


Chilling touch doesn't interact with cleave. It just adds a separate damage source to the target of the attack, doing X Magic damage.  So the damage from chilling touch won't cleave to others.  Not sure which damage is applied first, or what would happen to the cleave/spill damage if the magic is applied first and the target dies..."

**Estimated Date of Completion:** 4/8/2014
**Last Completed Workout:** Week 1 Day 2 Workout Name Plyometrics
**Current Weight:** 157.4 (I was 165 2 weeks ago)

**30 day goal:** Body fat percentage at 18%
**60 day goal:** Body fat percentage at 15%
**90 day goal:** Body fat percentage at 12%

**Comments/Questions:**

Once I get back to campus, starting next week, I will be running a 1 mile every day as well playing Basketball with friends in conjunction with P90X. Hopefully that cardio burns the stomach fat.

Also, you want different things from different drinks: sometimes you want refreshing, sometimes you want cooling, sometimes warming, sometimes, bitter, burning, sour, sweet, etc.  Water/melted ice dilutes the desired effect.

Zorro, yeah he'd still probably win, barring Demo getting a shieldbash-crit sword wombo combo for an instant kill. If he misses that, he's probably toast. But standard weapons Demo depends on the terrain a lot.

Nothing to say about Pyro VS Sanji, really.

Heavy's bullets do the same damage to the robots in MvM as they do to normal human enemies, but I don't know enough about Franky to give a fair judgement.

Usopp Vs Sniper, again, nothing to really say.

Brook VS Scout, Scout has more than his bat, remember. Assuming stock loadouts at least. Scout can fight skeletons on the halloween version of Hightower, and once again they do fairly normal damage that they do to normal enemies, though they're not the most effective, it's still something. And if Brook is moving too fast to reliably shoot, he'd stomp anyway because he outspeeds the scout. Scout would have experience in duels with enemy scouts, in which the Scattergun is still pretty reliable with good timing. I'd actually give it to Scout.

Chopper VS Medic, i'd give it to Chopper, assuming he can transform. The most Medic could probably do is run around trying to fire enough syringes into him to make him collapse. Those things do hurt a lot for rapid-fire things, but they're also a pain to aim.

Robin VS Spy, if the spy can fool her long enough to her behind her, he wins. Otherwise he can simply cloak and just shoot her from a distance. The spy pistols, at least as far as I know, are the only non-sniper rifle weapons in the game that don't have bullet spread, at least for the first shot. Then you have to wait a second before firing to reset the bullet spread. I don't know if Robin would be able to track him well or not, and chances are if she catches him with his cloak down, he's screwed. However, that's fairly unlikely, at least I think. I'd still give it to the spy.

Nami VS Engi, I don't have anything to add."

Necron_Overlord,funny,1389393355.0,"&gt;Saying that the argument doesn't make sense because female superheroes aren't topless is ignoring that these men are as showing as much skin as society will accept, which is what the argument is talking about.

Yes, but the problem is that super-heroines **don't** show as much skin as society will accept.  These superheroes are significantly underdressed compared to typical female superheroes.

While one can find a handful of super-heroines who fight crime in a bikini, most do not (and a few male heroes, such as Namor, do), and certainly none of the popular ones do.  Women's costumes do tend to show slightly more skin than men's costumes, thanks to thinks like cleavage-cutouts, bare midriffs and bare thighs, but women's daily wear tends to differ from men's in the same way, and such designs elements are often incorporated to make the costume look more like contemporary women's fashions. 

There are the four major archtypes for women's costumes.    The most revealing by far is *one-piece* design typified by [Wonder Women](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20051027200152/marvel_dc/images/f/f4/Wonder_Woman_DCAU_001.jpg), [Psylocke](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/125803/2395673-psylocke.jpg) and [Elektra](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/103530/1909253-0dxrf.jpg), where a one-piece bathing suit is typically combined with arm and leg accents with a lot of energy.  This is favored by characters who use a lot of martial arts.

Next is the classic **girl hero** look typified by [Mary Marvel](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/12/124966/2609555-349580_97911_mary_marvel_super.jpg) and [Supergirl](http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100819014410/superman/images/b/b0/Supergirl.jpg), where a blouse is combined with a cape and a mini-skirt.

There's the *lady detective* look typified by the [Blonde Phantom](http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/phantomblonde3.jpg), [Zantana](http://league.jmkprime.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Zatanna_Mistress_Of_Magic.jpg) and [Black Canary](http://fc03.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/226/6/9/Black_Canary_Colored_by_JGiampietro.jpg) -- fishnets make this look.

And, of course, the spandex bodysuit favored by everyone from [Invisible Woman](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_FMEJcIcnSqo/S9s6DGgwiiI/AAAAAAAAA7g/Vx8z2kvbzC4/s1600/Sue-Storm.jpg) to [Batgirl](http://static3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090617143551/batman/images/a/ac/Batgirl_%28DCAU%29_01.jpg) to [Vixen](http://www.blackactionfigure.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/vixen.jpg).

There are a lot of variations, but almost all female costumes hew to these patterns, with various different embellishments.

[Starfire](http://girlsgonegeek.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/starfire.jpeg) is more the exception than the rule, and in fairness her costume is based on the sort of outfits alien princesses always wear in early space opera (since she is an alien princess)."

While Elementary shows Holmes as brilliant, the story is more about Holmes coping with his difficulties rather than Holmes/Mycroft/Moriarty being so far above everyone else.  It is a different take on the story, one that becomes more obvious with BBC Sherlock on at the same time.

Allow me to expound loquaciously upon the plight and responsibility of all homebrewers and home wine makers, as I have come to understand it.

Only recently did homebrewing become legal in all fifty states. The regulatory bodies look upon homebrewing with a gimlet eye, distrustful, suspicious, and with a desire to more heavily regulate or tax the industry, given the slightest provocation. 

Our forebrewers fought for the right to make alcohol (which, certainly, in practice, is an impossible thing to prevent) in our own homes, and now we must remain steward to the practice of safely and responsibly pursuing the hobby. To do otherwise endangers not only ourselves and any that drink our swill, but the rights of all that dabble in the craft in any way. Though an entire industry revolves around our needs, do not think for an instant that your right to make your own booze is safe.

This is why those dabbling in dangerous ingredients, or selling for profit are oft-regarded with such disdain.

Your array is already set up correctly, you just need to up the count and rotate the empty around an axis (I chose the x, but y works too - it'll just do it in a different arc).  With a count of 8, a rotation of 45 degrees gets you even spacing.

I mean look at BTC Tipping. If you get tipped, you get tipped something like .0012 which is like $1, or you could get tipped 1 DOGE which could also be $1.


DOGE Tipping will not die, but rather the amounts will shrink as value goes up. Here's the thing, DOGE is still in it's infancy. Nobody knows whether it's going to up or down for sure. However, why not take part? If you have a semi-decent computer, you can mine a few thousand doges, toss them on a flash drive in a safety deposit box and who knows....

2 years later, there could be 2 scenarios.

1) DOGE is now worth $1/coin. You get your flash drive and sell all your coins and pocket $5000 before taxes.

2) DOGE is worthless and goes to $0.0000000. You get your flash drive and wipe it clean.


Iam not recommending you go and BUY DOGE. It's still easy enough to mine, so I figure why not mine. I personally have not put in any money into DOGE, I can mine it easily. My dad threw in $15 for 30k coins. He already tossed it in his safety deposit box.

Current price for 1M doge is around $420. So either you can get .5 BTC or 1M Doge. Granted BTC is a safe bet, but it's $400... Who know what could happen with DOGE. I am willing to risk $400..."

There was this group of people who had some weird claim on their booth. Doug, one of our bartenders decided to play enforcer so they could get their same booth. That was really weird, but I'll come back to that later.

This group was there all the time. I went on a date with the blond guy, despite better judgement, because he was constantly picking up random bimbos at the bar. He was really paranoid after he broke up with me, like I was going to kill him or something.

PathToExile,AskReddit,1389394062.0,"I was raised in a Lutheran family, went to Lutheran schools from K-12, have read the Bible cover-to-cover twice and I am an atheist.

The change for me started in Junior year religion classes when we began to study other religions, I couldn't wrap my head around so many religions and all of them devoutly proclaiming to be the ""correct"" one. Eventually I began to realize that religion is what we use to rationalize our own existence, that this universe didn't come about by sheer chance and that we have a spot reserved for us in heaven or hell.

Where religion falls apart is when we have ""religious professionals"" and zealots that warp the teachings of their religions to suite their own agendas (extremism), when we justify atrocities in the name of our deities (the Crusades).

If our God/gods are omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient then why do all seem to be so very petty (i.e.; [Deuteronomy 6:15](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206:15))? If there is a God I don't think he will be as childish as we make him out to be, he won't require that we believe in His son being sent to die on a cross for us but instead that we lived good lives, did good things for others and treated all His creation with respect.

I think religions, at their core, are beautiful teachings meant to inspire the best in us but as humans we are nowhere near advanced enough to execute these concepts and ideals without glaring failures and misinterpretations."

codayus,javascript,1389394098.0,"Heh.  They actually have an entire section in the docs devoted to why Riot.js does *not* do two way data binding.  Apparently it's a sore spot with them.

Unfortunately, I think their arguments are deeply flawed.  It all comes down to the idea that this:

    &lt;div&gt;You've clicked &lt;span data-bind='text: numberOfClicks'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; times&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button data-bind='click: registerClick'&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
 
    var ClickCounterViewModel = function() {
        this.numberOfClicks = ko.observable(0);
 
        this.registerClick = function() {
            this.numberOfClicks(this.numberOfClicks() + 1);
        };
    };
    ko.applyBindings(new ClickCounterViewModel());

Tightly couples the view and controller, hardcodes logic in the DOM, and means that you can't change the view and controller independently, but this:

    &lt;div&gt;You've clicked &lt;span id='numberOfClicks'&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; times&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button id='registerClick'&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
 
    var numberOfClicks = 0
    $('#registerClick').click(function() {
        numberOfClicks = numberOfClicks + 1;
        $('#numberOfClicks').text(numberOfClicks);
    });

is perfectly fine, because you can change the template and the view logic completely and everything will still work just fine.

This is madness.  The first example doesn't ""harcode logic in the DOM"", despite what Moot claims, but it *does* represent some degree of coupling (although not as much as critics claim), and it does mean that you can't just randomly change your templates without updating your logic.  But that makes it *exactly like the second example*.

The conviction present in some quarters that any sort of coupling between the view and controller layers is wrong *unless* the coupling overloads CSS class names in which case it's fine is just bizarre.  In the real world CSS classes are the *worst* way to do it, because it means your designer tinkering with the DOM, refactoring your CSS, or even just adding a wrapper DIV to fix some obscure layout bug in early versions of Firefox can break your entire app.  If you're using CSS classes as some sort of ""hey, this DOM element needs to represent the value of this variable"" flag, then just add a data-bind or ng-model attribute or whatever and be done with it.  You're making things more fragile —and no less tightly coupled — by using CSS.

Meanwhile, the entire idea that coupling itself is bad is *itself* wrong headed.  You shouldn't mix concerns, but your view and controller are still linked together via an effective API; in my Knockout example my viewmodel exposes numberOfClicks() and registerClick() functions.  **NO** you can't randomly change your API without updating the client that consumes that API.  That's not a problem or a code smell that's How Coding Works Here On Planet Earth.  Meanwhile the jQuery example is just as coupled via a closely analagous API, but good luck glancing at the code and figuring out what the API is, since it's buried under jQuery event bindings.  Yech.

TL;DR:  Looks like a good library, but they've drunk the koolaid on the subject of two-way data binding."

The heated air wants to rise naturally, so the construction of the fireplace is an ally in making the draft.  Once the draft gets going, a hotter fire speeds it up.  The draft is what prevents smoke from getting into the house-- the house interior has too much air blowing *into* the fireplace.

It doesn't take much of a pressure difference to create airflow in a house-- that's why opening a window on each side of your house (and all the doors in between) can create a noticeable breeze between those two windows.  "

Beards were in many cultures a symbol of the ruling class: in some cultures ONLY kings could have beards, and in Egypt the female pharaoh wore a decorative beard to legitimize her rule.

You could consider the beard to represent wisdom and authority. Perhaps it may have had something to do with the new heir coming into the family!"

IngwazK,TumblrInAction,1389394165.0,"&gt;“Queering” kids’ movie characters is brony nonsense.

[](/rdwut)wut?  I can only assume they're talking about the idea that the character ""Rainbow Dash"" is gay or queer or something.  To which I would reply, in the fandom, there are bronies who think that every character is queer or gay or something.  The very large majority do this jokingly or accept that there's no actual evidence for it and that it's just their headcanon.  Those who do not are generally regarded as silly.  

I havent seen the movie Frozen yet, but the poster provided no real substantial evidence.  Also, you can't really take a movie like x-men, which is based off a comic book series that has been going on for god knows how long, and suddenly say ""OMG, THIS TOTALLY REPRESENTS MY PARTICULAR MOVEMENT BECAUSE THEY ALL FEEL LIKE OUTCASTS"".  

Newsflash, pretty much every movement feels like outcasts.  Sure, there are definitely some parallels in the first movie that were intentionally put in there (""have you tried being normal?""), but to take the entire thing and say it's a movie about LGBTQQIUABBQSANDVICH+ is ridiculous.

If you're not familiar with falsetto vs full voice, compare the power behind Mars' voice when compared to that of Justin Timberlake (who seems to sing almost exclusively in falsetto) and when Robin Thicke hits high notes (also falsetto).

If you have to go to the doctor for any reason, be sure to tell them that your pulse in your right wrist runs along the outside of your radius in a straight line down from your thumb, not on the palmar side where it should be; otherwise they WILL think you are dead. Also the reason that wrist hurts so much right now is because you tore the ""watchband ligament"" - it's cool, we're gonna get that fixed with cadaver tissue in a month or so. And you have osteoporosis (yes, I know, you're only 28, but you were depressed in your teenage years and tried to starve yourself to death which didn't bode well for your bone health) so be careful when you step off curbs and stuff that you don't break anything. Oh, and be extra careful driving at night, because we still haven't figured out what causes that halo effect around bright lights and it can be tough to see, especially when it's raining.

And please don't forget to take your birth control pill; I don't want to get my body back and find out you've left a passenger in the backseat. And please please don't fuck up my nails - I'm trying to grow them out."

Necron_Overlord,funny,1389394482.0,"&gt;Why does the pose look ridiculous on one gender and not on the other?

Because the purpose of the pose is to accentuate the breasts and ass, and men don't have breasts, and generally have narrower, flatter asses -- that's why they always have to draw the men with bubble butts to make this work.  So it looks silly.  It would look just as silly if a flat-chested girl with no ass did it.

Men look sexiest when they stand with their backs straight and shoulders squared, as this shows off their shoulders and accentuates the belt of adonis (""the V"") that women love so much.  [Like so](http://walkbarefoot.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/naked.jpg) (top link for ""ryan gosling sexy"")."

lamblikeawolf,short,1389394501.0,"I agree. Especially because of the way this subreddit is segregated (short for males is considered 5'7"" or under, and 5'3"" or under for females), and the fact that average male height across different demographics in the US falls between 5'7"" and 5'10"", and for females falls between 5'2"" and 5'5"".

What OP could do, if he wanted to keep the categories from becoming too narrow, but also more accurately reflect height information is to have the height range ""buckets"" arranged by standard deviations from the mean. Couldn't he? Of course, then the poll would have to get a little more complex, as there would be separation between average heights by ethnicity or country, as well as the different ranges of ""buckets"" for females and males.

On top of this, just asking if someone is single or dating doesn't accurately reflect the distribution either, and is confounded by something like age as well. For example, I think it is more likely that someone in their 40s or 50s would be ""dating"" because they are married than someone who is in their 20s, who would be ""single"" because they are between SOs, if that makes sense? And to weed out the difference between easily getting dates vs. difficult time getting dates, you would have to ask a question about the last few times someone had been on a date, and not just leave it with ""single vs. dating.""

On top of this, there are also many people that don't necessarily look for relationships, and would consider themselves single, even though they have plenty of casual sex and don't necessarily have an issue finding someone to hook up with. Which would have to be it's own category.

All of these things make this kind of study a hell of a lot more complicated than OP probably intended.

The factors involved in dating and mate selection and hook-up selection are all super complicated because people are also super complicated and have widely varying preferences.

Paramount ordered Anderson to cut the film by thirty minutes and delete some of the violence, a decision that he regrets. Some of the lost scenes were offered as special features on the 2006 DVD but were taken from poor quality video tape, the only format in which the scenes now exist; the studio had little interest in keeping unused footage and the film has since been lost

If a particular ethnic group(say Indians) accounts for 30% of all the crimes(300) it is reasonable to assume that they account for 30% of the reported crimes as well(30 out of 100). So I think that the crime statistics I posted are relevant. I am finding it hard to understand why you and others in this thread are insisting on the narrative of ""Indians are bad at this"" based on some personal anecdotes and the ranting of some moron on twitter when there is no actual evidence to support this. On the contrary I gave you some evidence(that is at least partially relevant as I just explained) that indicates that this might not be the case. But you refuse to consider it. Ah well, I don't really care anymore. I was just posting all this in the hope that someone on the wall might be swayed.

p.s I always go around town when I am sober :). I stopped going to nightclubs after I went there once, because it is not my kind of thing.

slockley,AskReddit,1389394666.0,"I've always been confused by formal logic and set theory, but I gather you mean that god can exist as having any set of revealed or unrevealed characteristics.  My claim to the contrary assumed that for the purposes of the Wager, the true God must be one among those gods for whom a belief system exists.  Here's why:

If God had not revealed himself to mankind, then all bets would be off.  Any belief we could hold is equally likely to yield positive results or negative for our personal self-interest.  However, if God has revealed himself to mankind, then His qualities are known by man, and we can orient our beliefs to maximize our benefit, according to the wager.  And the wager itself asserts the imperative: we *should* respond to a known belief system for our maximal benefit.

&gt; Every potential deity is just as likely to exist as any other.

That's only true if there is no more information than a conceptual idea that a god may or may not exist.  But any new relevant information adjusts the probabilities.

So I'll continue to discount unrevealed god-candidates for the reasons I stated above.  So our set is those gods who have ever been believed in by anybody.  Quite a few.  Consider gods that nobody believes in anymore.  Isn't that a mark against, probabilistically speaking?

Or consider a God that came to Earth in the form of a God-man named Jesus, who reportedly did a bunch of things that violated the very physical laws He set in place (virgin birth, miracles, resurrection).  Mark against?  Maybe, but after all, He was demonstrating the fact that He is fully God, who, according to the same religious belief system predates and was the Sole Cause for the universe, and would then be the only one with inner access to power beyond mortal man.

But then, in light of those improbable claims, 11 apostles lived lives after Jesus undisputed death and supposed resurrection, proclaiming the truth of the resurrection to their dying day.  Furthermore, at least some of them died *because of* that resurrection, which they claimed to witness firsthand.  So 11 individuals were either all crazy, all hallucinating, all fooled into believing they spoke with a dude they saw die, or the claims about Jesus' resurrection (and by extention, other claims Jesus made, including deity) were true.

In my view, this is a mark in favor of the probability of the Christian God being the one true God.

You certainly don't have to agree with my conclusions, but I feel like it's safe to conclude that there are better god-candidates than others, and that the unrevealed ones are not worth our time."

Other than that, it's just a matter of practise - you'll get it right first time every time after you've done a few.

Edit: you deleted your comment about joining and parenting, so hopefully you've worked that one out, but just in case, here's what I put as a reply: Not sure what's happening there, I'm afraid - I can't duplicate it in your file.  The easy way might be to apply the array, then join them with ctrl+j to make one object, but if you still want to have the ability to modify the array, then select the rays, then the empty (or the empty then the rays), then finally the sun itself and hit ctrl+p and choose Set Parent to Object.  That way, when you move the sun, the rays and the controlling empty move with it, but you can still manipulate them separately.  It's all about the order you select them in.

Facts don't matter. Getting elected matters. These *are* the reasons that politicians don't support legalization, it doesn't effect them whether they are true or not.

Besides that, say that there is a candidate running for president, and he/she says they want to legalize pot. How many of you would go out and vote for that person, regardless of their other policies? I don't know about you, but if a politician doesn't make weed a talking point, I'm not going to immediately dismiss their candidacy. I'm much more interested in ending the US foreign interference, ending institutional discrimination against gays, and getting a better health care system. It's an issue, but it isn't the BIGGEST issue. Not for me, and most definitely not for most Americans. Because at the end of the day, regardless of all epidemiological studies, smoking weed is a CHOICE. Everyone knows weed is illegal. Lots of people know they may be treated unfairly by the courts depending on a number of factors. But it is an informed choice with known consequences, and when you make a choice, you face the consequences. That is the American way (unless you are rich)."

StopTalkingOK,dwarffortress,1389394904.0,"I suggest you think of using a caste system. Slaves, peons, crafters, military, and nobles.

Slaves have only one job, like cooking, brewing or fish cleaning and they do it 24/7 and have nothing else enabled.

Peons do menial tasks; all hauling farming, fishing, milking plant gathering etc. I *also* assign them woodcutting and make lots of training axes for the purpose, and assign masonry for the purpose of fast constructions. I only allow one ""crafter"" to use the masons workshop though. They are all named ""Peon"". A few peons are miners instead of wood cutters, depends on how many picks i have laying around. Peons are expendable.

Crafters do not ever go outside to avoid risk of assault, they have rock and wood and item hauling turned off. They also do not recover wounded or feed them. Basically anything that could send them outside or cause a significant delay in producing a workshop item is disabled for them. Each crafter specializes in a single trade and get named things like ""DaVinci"" (architect), or ""TageFrid"" (carpenter).

I break military down into ""Melee"" and ""Marks"" groups, marksdwarves get assigned all animal related skills, hunting, trapping etc. They are also plant gatherers. Melee guys have no special assignments other than anything they might already be good at. All military is kept outside as much as possible and have hauling jobs turned off except for wood hauling. They recover wounded but do not feed them.

Nobles never may go outside but never leave outside the walls, I allow them to do almost any task they have a proclivity for as long as it isn't dangerous and have all hauling except for wood turned on. They do not recover wounded.

I'm not trying to be argumentative, I'm just curious where [intersexed people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex#Prevalence) fit into this view.  It's more common than we might think and the very definition of intersexed implies that it does not fall within the binary.  And those who seek sex reassignment do, by definition, change their physical sex.

Googling the word *gender* brings up far more hits for *gender presentation* which ties into the social aspect.  I was talking about gender identity from the very start in an attempt to be less ambiguous."

javatimes,CriticalGender,1389395053.0,"the first part of that comment was not a direct response to you, and it actually wasn't about you directly at all.  It's just plain foolish to heavily imply that just because someone has problems with the really fucked up and punitive gender role system that this means they have an ""intersex condition known as transsex"" or however it is that you phrase it.  Because being transsexual is not at all a reaction to societal gender roles and the gender binary. I suggest you think more about the kind of cause and effect relationships you are implying exist.  Or, if this is all just shit stirring, consider that you cannot continue to try to play things both ways of ""here's a post with heavy inferences implied!""/ ""oh, I wasn't saying that.""  That's considered inflammatory, dirty pool, and disingenuous.  I didn't think you intended on this to just be a shit-stirring group. If you did, well, good job on trolling me I guess.

Viv, I've been disclosed as trans for ten [13 actually] years. I have been active in dozens of trans male internet and real time support spaces. I don't have references for everything I've heard and seen, but I'll try to throw up a handful of links for anyone who might be happening along this. Trans men have the same capacity for trans misogyny as cis men, and in some ways more (like in communities of queer women, or in support groups that are heavily trans male) and some ways less (like your husband, it seems.)

and i mean, hell, I can keep google searching various things I remember over the years, but the thing is--trans misogyny from trans men is very much like trans misogyny generally. It's in the post phalloplasty guy (Tony Beretto Neto is his name, see here for more info **http://freedominwickedness.tumblr.com/post/42234889261/erica-inchoate-on-transchat-and-on-body-shaming-trans**very important post) who attended Michigan Women's Music Fest for years pre transition and decided he was welcome there *post phalloplasty* and after their TERF womyn-born-womyn declaration and his misdeeds got directly attributed to bogey trans women because they were already a target and trans men were tacitly accepted at michfest for years and years even after they'd gone on testosterone, and they attended IN DROVES.  It's in the female assigned trans folks who continue to attend women's colleges even while their trans sisters are almost never allowed entrance.  It's even in the trans men who post in W4W on craigslist and other dating sites (http://stufftransmenlike.wordpress.com/2008/09/18/trans-men-like-craigslists-w4w/ someone I know well wrote that) because they can lean on their female assigned status when it gets them laid.

Necron_Overlord,funny,1389395240.0,"&gt;It's a rather commonly reported stat that 40% of comic book readers are women. 

That 40% of people who ""like"" comic books on facebook are women means nothing.  That has fuckall to do with readership and sales.  Fangirls who love Tom Hiddleston's Loki think they love comic books, but they don't actually *buy* them.

That same article says that DC comics found that -- based on actual in store sales -- 7% of comic readers are women.  Why didn't you quote that figure?

The comic book companies don't cater to women because every single time they have attempted, they have failed.  They actually continue throwing money down that black hole, just because feminists manage to guilt and shame them into it, but the reason they focus on their male audience is because men **actually spend money on comics**.  They churn out the male power fantasies because men **buy** them.

Why don't you go complain about the various Romance novel publishers not catering to male audiences.  It would make exactly as much sense as what you're doing.  But you won't do that, because everyone knows that's stupid.

It's only stuff that appeals to men that is bad.  It's only stuff that girls don't like that has to be abolished and destroyed, so that the whole world can be made safe for the delicate sensibilities of little girls.

gualdhar,nfl,1389395350.0,"Mixed bag. Some look great, some look bad, a lot are injured.

2 - **Christine Michael** - RB  
Hasn't played much for us, since we've got Lynch and Turbin in the regular rotation. However, the few times we've seen him he's been between solid and amazing. He looks like a hybrid of Lynch style smash-mouth with a few more cuts in his runs. He's being groomed to be Lynch's replacement.

3 - **Jordan Hill** - DT  
He's been in the DT rotation a bit, but he's had some injury problems to contend with. Still, he's got 1.5 sacks in only four games. He's got potential. We just need to see if he can overcome his injuries.
 
4 - **Chris Harper** - WR  
Biggest disappointment. He was straight up waived in the offseason. Picked up by SF, waived again, then picked up by GB. I think he's still there on special teams.
 
5 - **Jesse Williams** - DT  
Tha Monsta has been injured since week 2. From his play at Alabama he looks like he'll be an excellent fit for the team, but we'll see how things play out next year.

5 - **Tharold Simon** - CB  
Another casualty. He's been on the PUP list the whole year.

5 - **Luke Willson** - TE  
This guy has been playing very well for a rookie. 272 yards in 20 receptions, with a Wilson to Willson TD. With a little more coaching and practice, I could see him being a starting TE for the team. He just needs to work on his run protection.
 
6 - **Spencer Ware** - RB  
Injuries seem to be a common theme. He was placed on IR in week 2. His injury was part of the reason we resigned Michael Robinson. He might be a capable run blocker for Lynch, but we won't know this year. Besides, Derrick Coleman seems to be working well. Unless the coaches see something I don't he might get released.
 
7 - **Ryan Seymour** - G  
He was on our practice squad for most of the year, until the 49ers signed him before our game in SF.

7 - **Ty Powell** - DE  
Was on our practice squad for a bit, then released. Not surprised with the DEs we have. Bills have him now.
 
7 - **Jared Smith** - DT  
He's been on the practice squad all season. With the DTs we have now I don't see him playing unless we release a couple in the offseason.

7 - **Michael Bowie** - OT  
Part of our swiss cheese line. He played a lot when Okung was out, and I was not impressed. He needs a lot of work if he's going to be starting caliber, especially on a team with a guy like Okung. With work he might beat out our right tackle Giacomini in a couple seasons. But if anyone can coach him up to Okung standards it's our line coach Tom Cable.

I am a person who almost spontaneously became athiest for no reason at 10. Like a chemical imbalance which eradicated the ability to belive in supernatural phenomenon.  Now imagine a kid who thought this was the greatest human achievement since the moon landing. It was replaced by shame. Every adult in my life up to that point were believers of Christianity in a rural Southern town. You can imagine how disappointing my life became after a thing such as heroes or role model no longer existed. How when the first time I experienced death or faced lifes hard questions I was consoled by fairy tales and a fix all patch of god. Religious became a synonym for disappointment. It became an excuse for people to not love me, listen to me, or encourage the growth of a human

Outside of range I think it is fine, I mean it is a vehicle whose only purpose is to kill air units and it is not very good for much else. If they cut the range out where it has to be mid map to have rule it should be okay because at that point it should theoretically be in harms way of ground forces and can be hunted down as a team effort rather than nerfing it to the point where really good fly players are invincible. 

In bf3 it was really bad with the AH to the point where it was unkillable unless it got really really close so every cannon round hit.

if you really want to be cautious, here's a trick I employed while a teen:

Have him pull out before he's about to cum (he should do this BEFORE the point of no return).  A quick pull out and check to make sure the condom is still on.  He can do this without looking - all it takes is a quick run of the hand along his shaft - takes two seconds max.  IF the condom is still intact, he can reinsert and continue fucking until he cums.  If the condom is NOT intact, he'll need to take that one off and put a new one on.

You have to be careful, but keep in mind national travel alerts tend to err on the side of caution. Make the decision for yourself, but keep in mind they all tend to be overly cautious. 

For instance, I am looking into selling my motorcycle and going to Pakistan this summer. There are always risks, but much of the country is generally safe. Keep in mind ""generally safe"" does not mean you dont have to be careful. There are always risks as evidenced by Nanga Parbat murders and the recent suicide attacks in Erbil, but there are risks anywhere you travel. 

There are also preconceptions that scare people. I met a Turkish Kurd in the Istanbul airport as I was going out East who told me I was ""crazy"" for going to Iraq, yet there are more travel warnings for Eastern Turkey than Kurdish Iraq. I was almost robbed at knifepoint in Eastern Turkey, in a region the US embassy specifically says they wont help you if you get into trouble. There are intermittent consulates in Iraq, so it would actually be ""better"" to get in trouble in Iraq over Eastern Turkey.  

There is very little information so I did a writeup on my trip. It ended up turning more into a story than a writeup, but I think it still offers some good travel advice.

[Long writeup and map I made of my trip](http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/18bo3n/my_writeup_and_travel_tips_on_northern_iraq_and/).

EDIT: I should point out the non-Kurdish parts of Iraq are still considered very dangerous. Even parts of the Kurdish region are, like Kirkuk. I accidentally went through Kirkuk, more in the linked story. "

slockley,AskReddit,1389395840.0,"&gt; Once you have gone full Atheist or if you started that way and never got involved in the Church, I don't think you can honestly use the probability as a way to trick yourself into believing.

I agree, that it's not a one-step process.  I think the consequence of the wager for an Athiest is an assault on the practicality of Athiesm itself.  Athiesm (the assertion that there is no God) is no more provable than theism, and yet it yields no ultimate benefit to the believer.  Agnosticism is rhetorically easy, but again does not serve the Agnostic.

Therefore, since there may be a God, and the benefits of belief may be (as much as infinitely) better than nothingness (or worse) upon death, then the rational mind must seriously consider the probability of a benevolent God.

*Edit: ""True Belief"" can come later, if the evidence points you there.*"
mariesoleil,asktransgender,1389395841.0,"&gt;dismorphia

It doesn't really matter if you get the terminology perfect, but dysmorphia is when a person has a problem with a perceived and possibly non-existent flaw with their body. An example might be a 20-year old man who thinks he is very scrawny but is actually very muscular and so spends far too much time at the gym. Or a woman who thinks she is incredibly ugly despite being attractive and gets multiple plastic surgeries on her face to try to be pretty. The salient point here is that they do not see their bodies realistically.

Dysphoria is what most trans people have. Instead of not being objective about their body, a trans person with dysphoria does understand what they don't like about their body. They see what other people see, but they dislike it. A trans man with genital dysphoria understands that he doesn't have the same penis as a cis man, and this bothers him. As a trans woman, I realistically understand that my breasts are too small to be proportional to my ribcage. What's important about dysphoria is that we do understand what our bodies look like, but they don't feel right to us."

I think the reason why feminism is so popular is because it's the only paradigm that has been routinely used to analyze gender problems. So I think we need to focus on promoting an equalist paradigm to analyze issues like the one Warren Farrell promotes.

For Courtney to have counterfeited that, she would have had to have not only been a fairly cunning counterfeiter, but have been criminally brilliant enough to feign the drug-addled depression worsening as evidenced by the handwriting becoming larger/less constrained.

My theory: The reason it reads like a retirement letter and culminates in a suicide note, is the same reason it looks well written and slowly (and then rapidly) descends into anarchy. The guy's mental state is descending throughout the letter by some combination of drugs and depression - the latter of which is compounded by him writing the letter in the first place.

It probably started out as just that - a retirement letter. 

*I don't think it's a forgery based on some peculiarities in his penmenship that are consistent throughout. Specifically, the way he makes lower-case 'a's. He also make's 'P's in two different ways, but that too seems consistent - that he's inconsistent."

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389396212.0,"I swear on my left testicle, the favoured one, that this is either a massive troll or a family fucking feud on reddit. 

I remember even commenting and somewhat sympathizing with the 32 yr old Indian woman, months ago, when she complained on SEVEN SUBS (that's one sub for each of Satan's blessed heads) about her problems finding a man who would respect her after she spent most of her youth fetishizing and disrespecting them.

Then later, another thread about some guy complaining about a spoiled sister 30+ (around her age with a problem).

Later, a story/complaint coming from Asian female doctor around the age of 32-33 or so, struggling to find a guy within her economic class... Hell, I *still* remember commenting on her abysmally low salary for a doctor -- 140k USD.

Now this. The little sister finally chimes in about her 33 yr old (big sis must have had her birthday recently) doctor of a sister whose marital troubles are pissing everyone off.

Now, despite being a cynical guy, I force myself to give people the benefit of the doubt. I even feel like it's a duty to do so... but come fucking on! My personal integrity just did backflips while keeping up with its rolling eyes.

Either change that to an emission shader, or make it a mix shader with a diffuse and an emission (which I just looked at, and it looks pretty cool).  The factor (marked ""fac"") is how much of each shader shows through - 0.5 is half and half, 1 is all the second shader, 0 is all the first.  For reference, if you're going to be using Cycles, you really need to learn how to use the node editor.  You can do a lot with the materials tab, but the node editor is faster and more powerful.  I picked up a lot of stuff about it from various Andrew Price tutorials - his one where he textures a rusty lamp is especially useful for that.

&gt;""People were more aware of Josef's plight and were much more friendly towards him, giving him money, but that only increased massively his resources for drinking and that was not good for him,"" the inspector added.

I think it would actually be selfish of me to facilitate the endangerment of a person who might not be in control of their intellectual or psychiatric faculties by giving them money for drink/drugs, solely in order to soothe my conscience. They're already (usually) entitled to social welfare which they can spend however they like. I see no reason to supplement that. Instead, I give money to homeless charities, who will spend it on giving these people blankets and food and make sure they're actually looked after.

* a boy (Kent Lastname) who was associating with her out of the hopes of being with her brother Chris. 
* Mayor West, who is arguably the best of her dates and genuinely seems to care for her, is more than twice her age and is shown being violent and acting irrationally throughout the series and episode.
* a boy (Anthony) who later has sex with Meg's mom after she seduces him with ease.
* Quagmire, a creep and a rapist, possibly a murderer as well.
* Doug, the religious kid who bails on having sex with Meg right as he sees her naked and she's super vulnerable, leaving her devastated. 

I can't figure out who the kid eating ice cream with her is, but there are plenty of other examples. Michael, the med student that left her at the altar after realizing that she's not actually pregnant; Toby, the guy she meets on the internet that *steals her kidney*; Brian, the alcoholic dog...my point is, yes, sure, Meg might have had more dates than you, but each and every one of her dates has either manipulated, used, abused, or humiliated her.

ixAp0c,modelmakers,1389396667.0,"I usually leave everything separated as long as possible, only gluing on things that can easily be painted once glued on.  

For armor I like to leave the wheels off of the lower hull, until they are all painted and weathered properly.  It's very difficult to paint and weather once you put the wheels on, especially after tracks are added.  

I figure out what can be glued on depending on if there is something to paint underneath it that will be visible, if there is a step to glue a box or tool onto a tank and there is a part underneath that will be slightly visible because the piece is raised above, I will wait to glue it until after I paint the area it's being glued onto.  For things like windows (I don't know the technical term for the armor slit windows on a tank) and mantlet plates I usually glue them on and then paint them, along with anything that will be painted in the same color as the hull.  

I like to wait as long as possible to glue stuff on, to ensure I don't rush and do something that might make another step harder.

An example would be parts that go in front of a decal, you won't want to glue any parts on that will partially cover a decal surface, because it will make the decal a lot harder to apply.  Look at this tank for an example, this is my first build, note the decals behind the antenna guard in the first pic:

http://imgur.com/a/oPVx3

Tracks are usually the very last thing to be added.  I didn't glue the hull or turret in that model since it was an old motorized kit (that doesn't come with the motor anymore, turned into a beginner model kit) and the hulls were designed to snap together for quick battery changes. 

I use regular brushes, so my method may vary a bit from those who use airbrushes.  "
callc92,backpacking,1389396670.0,"consider getting a Europe wide train pass and go inter railing. there are a few companies that do them with packages that cover just one country, a group of countries or all of Europe. you pay for the ticket and then get free travel for a certain number days. if you plan it right you can get over night trains and save money on accommodation. plan your route and book hostels before hand. 

if you live within the EU then get an EHIC card. it's free and will cover health insurance.

if you have to fly make sure that everything can fit inside your back pack as most airlines won't accept your bag if there's stuff strapped to the outside. if you need to, don't bring toiletries and buy some on arrival, or bring one set between you (obviously don't share toothbrushes etc, but you don't need a tube of toothpaste each).  basically, if you can share stuff do, you'll be surprised at how much space a shampoo bottle takes up!some places offer clothes washing services which wool cut down on how much clothes you need to bring.

there's a lot to do for free in London, especially museums. some museums do adult only night events that are good if you want something to do in the evening. try and watch a west end show, you can normally turn up to box offices on the day and get discount tickets. if you're there for a few days and will be using public transport get an oyster card, you can get the deposit back if you give back your oyster at the end. also, no matter what the weather report says, be prepared for rain, so bring one of those packable rain Macs.

get travel insurance and if you're flying make sure you keep all your money and a days worth of clothes in your hand luggage, believe me it's not fun having to spend 3 days with no change of clothes and only half your money. warn your bank that you are going to several countries so they don't block your card. there a websites you should check out that make it cheaper to call abroad. register with your embassy before you go, this way they know what country you are in in case you need help. photocopy your passport etc in case you lose it and always make sure that someone knows roughly where your are. travelling is great fun and there us so much to see in Europe so have fun!"

The moon reflected a dim blue on the girl's hazel hairs, and Lott couldn't help but crack a faint smile as she approached her. *She's so pretty, even when she's asleep.* Lott pulled down the girl's lower lip, carefully lodging the canine in its destined socket.

voxanimi,Judaism,1389397120.0,"You may not get a lot of responses until tomorrow night since most people are getting ready for Shabbat, but here my own (limited) answers:

1. I don't think that scripture talks about transgender people directly. I don't know whether sexual reassignment surgery changes your halakhic sex, though my guess is that being transgender but not transsexual would not change your sex in the eyes of halakha.

2. I know that the Reform movement accepts transgender people as the gender that they identify with. Renewal, Humanist, and Reconstructionist probably do as well, but I do not have sources on those. Conservative would probably depend on the congregation and area. I'm the least certain about Orthodox, but my guess would be that most of Orthodoxy doesn't recognize being transgender as being aligned with halakha.

3. The denominations that pray with a mechitza or separation of the sexes are Orthodox and a small number of Conservative congregations. I think it's likely that the congregations that separate the sexes in prayer would be less likely to allow a transgender person to sit with the gender they identify with.

4. Because transgender people are just now becoming visible in this society and transgender people are such a small minority I don't think many people know much about it or that it's a widely discussed issue. As I said above, I think that the more theologically left-leaning denominations like Reform, Reconstructionist, Renewal, and Humanist will be the most likely to welcome transgender identity as a part of their congregations."

strangestdude,MensRights,1389397160.0,"The problem I've observed is that many feminists assert that feminism is about eliminating any and all gender related problems - not just women's. Like you said, that isn't there focus - however many feminists repeatedly try to convince men that they are actively concerned about non women's issues.

Plus I think that the feminist meta-narrative is inherently misandrist ie. the empowered male/masculine is responsible for all gender related social problems.

And no matter what gender the social issue effects, cis-women are directly or indirectly victims ie. the sentiment of misogyny or chauvinism underlies the problem.

So I think the above combined is harmful because it fosters a lack of cultural empathy for men's issues.

Therefore they're much more likely to go along with the status quo.

The good news is that in college, a lot of people I know went from being barely tolerable douchebags to actually being really awesome, well-rounded people. So the more you continue on, the better your peer group should get.

IN the mean time, though, just don't worry about the haters.

It's honestly a great strategy to have as a defensive unit to be competitive in a league that has become more pass oriented by design. Knowing that different officiating crews have different interpretations of PI/holding and varying levels of tolerance of it, it makes sense to test where the limits are each game amd adjust your play style accordingly. Establishing yourself as a physical team early in the game can sway the refs in your favor so that only the most blatant or egregious of incidents will be flagged.

slockley,AskReddit,1389397340.0,"&gt; My understanding is that it simply ignores the problem of other religions entirely.

You're probably right about that.  I'll concede the point.

&gt; Regardless: it is an assertion, you say? That's not good enough. Give me a reason why I should accept it.

It appears I don't use words good.  Perhaps instead of asserts, I should have said ""gives evidence that leads to.""  The reason you want is built into the wager.  There is a risk-free, potentially infinite-in-benefit endeavor to undertake in believing in God.  If you wish to accept multiple god-candidates, then the wager can be adapted to reflect the best benefit-probability belief system.

&gt; Remember, I don't accept the stories in the Bible as true, and I actually think most, if not all, of the Gospels are basically fiction. So the supposed 11 apostles mean nothing to me.

Fair enough.  Yet a religion was built around those stories, that grew wildly in the first centuries, despite its fundamental claims being supernatural.  There is evidence that supports the Christian claims.

And maybe you'll reject all the evidence.  Or it won't weigh favorably against the degree of improbability of a dude turning water to wine.  Or whatever.  Then, the wager still implies that you should check out a religion you think is more probably and beneficially true than Christianity.  But whatever god you pursue, you're doing yourself a favor over the alternative, so says the Wager."

got86ed,backpacking,1389397380.0,"It all comes down to personal preference and these are mine:

* Lightweight: Under 2 pounds is great for a 50-70L bag. Check out [GoLite's Jam Pack.](http://www.golite.com/gear/ultralite-backpacking)
* Flexibility in Comfort: Make sure it fits, and if not out of the gate make sure you can alter the fit through straps.
* Durability: Through research I have found some brands/materials tend to wear faster than others. I stay away from anything mesh. I have a history of catching everything on mesh and ripping it.
* Simplistic Design: I really only need a main compartment and a secondary compartment. Added pockets just get filled up with unnecessary (heavy) things. Minimal compression straps and side pockets are a nice to have.
* Ease of Use: Put the pack on. Can you reach everything you would need on the trail without taking off the pack? Water, trail snack, map/compass and knife? If so you've got a nice pack.

Things I don't particularly need or care about in a pack:

* Side opening for sleeping bag. This usually also means added material and zipper which to me is unnecessary weight and just another thing to break/rip in the backcountry.
* Frames. I have a frameless pack and actually took out the foam insert to save weight as well. I bring enough soft gear to make up for it. Think pad, clothes or tent.

* Additional pockets. As noted above I feel like if I had more than two compartments on the pack I would be obliged to bring items I wouldn't normally bring just to fill the pack up.

Take all advice you can get and then get out there and try it yourself. Many retailers will let you take things back if you've tried them and don't like it. I tend to purchase used goods too. Are about 60% of retail and you can turn around and sell it for about the same price you bought it for if you don't like it or want to upgrade. GL!"

It's not perfect, but no search will turn up a perfect list. The **Geek Ratings** on BGG use a modified version of the **Average Rating** (which is the total of the added up user ratings divided by the total number of ratings). The Geek Rating (which is how the **BGG Rank** is generated) uses an algorithm which adds a number of fake dummy ratings to games that have low numbers of ratings, and uses a median number (assumed to be around 5.5) for those ratings. This means a game that has three votes and each one rates it a 10 can't show up at the top of the BGG list, because it also has ~100 other ""dummy"" votes ranking it ~5.5. 

For Level 7 Omega to break out of this slump, it would need more votes. The exact algorithm on BGG is unknown, but if it accumulates over 5000 votes, and those 100 dummy votes stayed intact... they would stop having much of an impact."

That's great that you are not having side effects. But you may develop them in the future. And even if you don't, the pill still has *risks*. Risks like pulmonary embolism, gallstones, and breast cancer, just to name a few. Risks that get glossed over far too often.

If OP's girlfriend decides on her own that she wants to take hormones or implant a foreign device into her body, that's her choice (and hopefully her doctor will actually inform her of the risks and side effects, which happens all too rarely).

I got out of bed, took a shower, went out for lunch and then went to the hospital, where I continued to labor for a total of 26 hours before my son was born.  

My mother who had 3 children said that when she had her first (my sister) her water broke, she took a shower... had a sandwich... waited for my father to get home from work and THEN went to the hospital. 10 hours later she had my sister.  

With my brother she went in to labor and did the same thing, and ended up having my brother 10 minutes after she walked in the door. She said she almost had him at the gas station, because she expected it to go long and so my dad stopped for gas on the way to the hospital. 

With me, her last, she did the same thing.  She labored with me for 22 hours because I was born sunny side up.

I think guys greatly over-rate the value of getting every old PUA trick perfectly right. The thing with women is that its the overall impression that you make. 

This isn't figure skating; frankly it's a form of intimidation. A soft form of intimidation, but it is none the less a method whereby you instill dread in another human being. If you already intimidate her enough to to cause a visible physical reaction, then it's not a good idea to dial it up to Mike Tyson levels (although there are women who will take a ""yesplease"" is you do).

That said . . . when you're out in front of the game, there's some benefit to not laying more and more alpha on in layers. You can lose her that way. There will come a point at which the girl decides you're too much and she likely won't be able to retain you as a potential mate, at which point she'll go from nervous to flaky behavior that's actually a loyalty test.

They say that they would have killed Jamie if they were with Aerys. And that they know Viserys is on Dragonstone. By their vow, they justify guarding the tower.

The reason I brought up the marriage issue is because if R+L=J and J is indeed a bastard, then why guard the tower? Maybe Rheagar asked them nicely ""Hey if me and my dad and my kids all die, please ignore my bro who would then be the king and guard Lyanna? Thanks buds!"""

But ultimately some of that may not work, or work perfectly, and then you probably should have an open dialogue with your neighbors.  Just get it all out into the open: you hear them, they hear you.  It's unavoidable.  Then you guys can discuss strategies to make it less annoying for both of you.

You can discuss times you're likely to be out or at least not sleeping, so they can try to direct loud activities to those times, and vice versa.  You can agree to both be loud at the same time.  You can give each other specific times where you kindly request that the other person be as quiet as possible.

X is to 2,384 as

88 is to 100

Then we cross-multiply:

100 X = 88 * 2,384

And solve the equation for X:

X = (88 * 2,384)/100.

What you are asking is the same thing:

4,018.96 is to 4,567 as

X is to 100

4,018.96 * 100 = 4,567 X

401,896 = 4,567 X

X = 401,896 / 4,567

X = 88%

You won't wake up one morning and have tons of energy to clean, and run errands, and cook, etc., etc., but maybe one morning you'll have a little energy to clean, and the next day a little energy to do some errands. And it's not as if you are doing absolutely nothing, for I'm sure you still struggle with your recovery...and that's doing something!

Turns out the whole racist and neo fascist thing was happening anyway. It just so happened to have happened when Hitler was in the lead. So when he started invading places people got angry and yes there was a war, but it was only after, when the holocaust was discovered that people were like ""hey no that's not right. We're going to not just defeat the German govt in battle, we're going to dismantle it, crush it to pieces and salt the earth.""

While starting ww2 was pretty bad, it would definitely not have led to the intense dislike of the Nazi party by itself, without the holocaust. If ww2 had happened without the holocaust, without Hitler, it's probably that we would still have a massive Nazi movement in Germany, it's probable that Nazism would have spread as a political movement to more than just Germany before the shit hit the fan. 

Imagine if the countries surrounding Germany had rushed to its aid when it started the third Reich? Imagine if the entirety of Europe had fallen under the Nazi madness spell (which, remember, was manufactured) before the holocaust started?

They might have fucking WON ww2 without Hitler. And then where would we be?"

While I absolutely understand the reasoning of the 'it's better/similar/not as bad as, nicotine or alcohol' I feel like arguments for the legalization of marijuana should be based on its own merits and not because comparable substances are legal. I get that it's a counter-argument to those point to health concerns or impairment issues regarding marijuana, but it's always bugged me.



I feel it's somewhat--although not completely--analogous to a situation where an earlier curfew is imposed on a child. As expected, the child would argue that 'they had a later curfew when they were younger'. While it might be true, I don't think that alone provides a solid argument for their case. Legalization of marijuana should be based on what it can bring and provide and not because it's 'less bad' than other things.

Is feminism an effective alternative to transitioning for repressed trans men?

also, in this post there is this comment:
A person can legitimately identify as their assigned 'social gender identity' and *simultaneously* have a neurological state corresponding to a repressed 'innate gender identity'

also you said, in response to me:
If some person who has a masculinized brain identifies as a woman, then I assume they are a woman. But here's the thing, she can be a woman and a repressed trans man at the same time. These two states are not mutually exclusive.

and here: 
""For her, being a boy means having a penis. Since she couldn't magically grow a penis, she couldn't be a boy. It even took her ""some time"" to convince herself that she was not a boy, and she could ""just be a lesbian."" My husband says this is not uncommon for trans men, that some delay transition or don't do it at all because they believe that they can't get a satisfactory penis.""

Again, all I'm trying to do is show that by shortening the definition of *gender socialization* or *gender presentation* to be simply *gender*, we really cripple our ability to have any sort of meaningful discussion.  You and I both know there is more to gender than the social aspect so let's use terminology that helps further our understanding.

Your argument is sort of like me saying that when I use the word *cloud*, I'm only referring to cirrus clouds.  Cumulus and altostratus clouds?  Well sure, they're clouds too but you should know that when I say *clouds*, I'm referring to cirrus clouds.  It's ambiguous and really hinders a discussion where such distinctions might matter.

&gt;Our ability is special the same as the abilities of every other species, and we hold no particularly special place in it. We occupy a place, but it doesn't appear to be special, it just is. 


I don't know ... it seems to me you are saying we are special, but that being special is not especially special. Which is kind of confusing.


&gt;&gt;The post I was responding to said that science had robbed us of our ability to see ourselves that way, which is demonstrably wrong.

&gt;That's what I said, and I stand by it. Maybe we're talking past each other here, or maybe I'm just the only one with that kind of feeling, but I don't understand why we are more special, without falling to some kind of specie-ist preference. It is in my opinion worryingly similar to the white explorers of the 16th and 17th century, who happened across the savages and thought that obviously Europeans were smarter and more special than them.

I think it's unavoidable to have a specie-ist preference. It's a noble and right thing to try to overcome, though, I'm just disagreeing with the guy's assertion that science - as opposed to art, philosophy, or religion - has ""robbed"" us of the illusion that we hold a privileged, special place in the universe. Hawkings quote makes it clear that at least one of our most respected scientists is under the *very illusion he speaks of*, disregarding definitions of ""special"". And he is under this so-called romantic delusion *because* of science.

I myself think we are special, but don't think this means we should act as though it entitles us to anything special except a stronger sense of responsibility to other species and their environments.

Anyway, I'm not sure I really disagree with most of what you're saying, it is possible we are missing each others point, or one the other, but I've enjoyed your challenging of my views."

Edit: I am getting downvotes, presumably because people believe I am bashing OP. I am not. I am simply suggesting that, perhaps, the extraneous needs to be pared down a bit to make the story and characters flow better. When you are dealing with this many huge subjects in one story, of course you will end up losing some of the description time and dialogue time the characters may have had.

It also opens the door for continuity issues and plot-holes. I'm not saying it all isn't integral. But when I see that many things all wrapped up in one package, it screams at me that it all doesn't fit, but got thrown into the pot because it seems awesome and might go together. Everyone knows a novel or two or an author who is guilty of this. Even the big name authors do it from time to time. It usually winds up falling short not because of bad writing, but because it becomes convoluted.

No offense OP, hope you don't think I am bashing you. Nows the time to re-evaluate and pare down. Kill your darlings, as Faulker would say."

reyrey1492,AskHistorians,1389398769.0,"The 11 in 11R is for the section width (how wide the tire is) R is for radial construction. Usually the tire size is represented as (section width)/Aspect ratio (the ratio of section width/sidewall height)/R(for radial unless it's a bias-ply tire)and the rim size.

So for a 11R22.5 tire the section width is 11 inches in this case, the lack of an aspect ratio means it is a standard 90% for the aspect ratio, and the rim size is 22.5 inches in diameter.

I think I have an idea of what you're talking about with the small looking tires. If they're the ones I think you're talking about the tandems on a trailer will have smaller tires for easier loading. Just a different tire to fill a need and do the job."

If your case in point was specific to this exact video, then yes, you're right the fact the interviewer is not visible is part of the reason this can be seen as fake. If you use that as a general way to view all interviews, or ones where the interviewer has a motif or even all satirical interviews, then you're using a flawed method to deduce them as fake and should, as a said, take into account other factors. 

You haven't provided evidence because your whole point is completely open to interpretation and your meaning can be changed however you see fit because it was so general. Saying you should never trust such an interview doesn't help anyone. What is such an interview? One on this show? One that is satirical? One at a festival? 

At the end of the day, all I was saying is it is flawed logic to rely on one factor to deduce that the video is fake. Then you go an have a shit fit because someone said that you're not entirely right."

Amazon can create a quasi monopole in internet book selling, because it gain money in selling many things.                               
 With these profits, Amazon is able to sell books at broken prices, and even at price inducing a net loss, which are filled anyways by these earlier profits. Book sellers in France, who do sell on the internet, are unable to sell at their price, for obvious reasons. Plus, books in France are already something which provide a thin profit margin from the start.                         

This *is* price dumping. This *is* unfair competition.                         

If it continue, Amazon would eventually be almost the only one selling books on the internet, creating a quasi monopole.             

Do we want all book shops to close because they only sells books?                    

There's others companies selling others things than books on the internet, yet even them are less likely to compete because Amazon simply do not pay any taxes in France.                 

So what if France prefer to favorise new modern ways to sell things on the internet, via the book sellers who contribute to french society?

Nausved,relationship_advice,1389398796.0,"I think it would actually be a nice arrangement. I think my ideal living situation with my boyfriend (whom I've lived with for three years and get along *very* well with) would be one where we have separate kitchens, offices/studios, bathrooms, and possibly entertainment areas. We'd still share the same bedroom every night (excluding nights where one of us has to go to sleep and wake up extra early) and still hang out together every evening (so a shared living room would be nice). So, basically, I'd be happy with something along the lines of two houses next door to each other—or perhaps a house with an in-law suite.

We get along fabulously; we communicate well, yet have never had a fight, etc. We just have slightly incompatible ways of organizing the work spaces around us, managing meals, motivating ourselves to focus on work, etc. When we compromise, we both end up living in a way that makes us feel somewhat cramped, unhealthy, and unfocused. 

I am also comforted by the company of pets, while he is distracted by it; I'd love a living situation where pets could have free range of *my* areas, but didn't have access to his areas. I don't have any pets now because he works from home and we live in a studio apartment, but I desperately wish I could have a dog without encroaching on his work space.

We also love to talk to each other *way, way* too much—which makes us tend to procrastinate when the other is around. We both work best when the temptation to chat idly is removed."

I went last May and we rented a car for one day to do the Golden Circle. There are many companies that will pick you up at your hotel/hostel and shuttle you to your days activity.

We never took any cabs. If you are doing things in Reykjavik, you can just walk. But if you are going to be going far out of the the main city and doing things like the Golden Circle, then you will need a car.

bombeater,changemyview,1389399061.0,"&gt; ... if an okay-looking guy and a hot guy were to act the same way around most women, one would be the creep and the other would be okay because he's hot.

**It depends entirely on the woman, her preferences, and her mood**.

If a woman goes out thinking, ""I want to hook up with a hottie tonight,"" and she is approached by someone who she is not interested in due to his appearance, she will reject that person.

However, if a woman is just having fun and is open to the idea of meeting people without a short-term payoff based on the conventional beauty of the people she meets, the situation is completely different.

It's tough to approach this definitively because attractiveness is so subjective, but you must also remember that there are many **[confounding factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding)** in this situation: because of the exact perception you're describing, most ""non-hot"" guys are less likely to be *confident* in their approach compared to their ""hot"" counterparts.

In my experience, it is *less* frequent for people to respond based solely on the beauty of the person approaching them, and *more* frequent for people to respond based on that person's **confidence**.

Source: I am not a conventionally attractive man (long-haired, chubby, bespectacled), but I never been called a creep, despite my frequent flirtatious behavior around most women in and around my peer group. This might be biased by the type of women I hang out with; I rarely go to bars, but on the few times that I've gone, I'm still met with ""sorry, I'm not interested"" at worst.

---

&gt; Person A is more respected by society than Person B despite them having the same mentality.

Unfortunately this is just correct. Our culture has an ingrained notion of what constitutes ""beauty"", and it warps our individual subjective views. However, your *main* point about ""hot guy vs. average guy"" is not as widespread as you think it is, because while it can be stated that ""a hot guy, in general, is more valued by society than an ugly guy,"" it is an *extremely* general statement that, while it reflects an unfortunate truth about our culture, is not strong enough to form a reliable behavioral model for ""cold approach"" situations between strangers. There are too many other factors, the biggest being confidence, which is *affected* but nowhere near *determined* by conventional beauty."

What it really shows is a bunch of close-ups of dead faces, and then a pan-up of a bunch of dead bodies and the camp trying to clean up the mess behind them, but not like a SEA of dead bodies, like I somehow remembered.  It's still pretty fucking horrific.

And for the record, the WHOLE documentary is a lot more interesting than just a bunch of shocking images.

piratelibrarian,sex,1389399158.0,"I may be jumping to conclusions, but it kinda sounds like you wait for non-kid times, or when they're asleep or whatever to do the nasty. If so, you may want to reconsider that.

Contrary to popular belief, it doesn't hurt children to know that their parents are sexual beings and sex can be a lot of things. I don't condone flagrant displays of sexuality in front of sprogs or anything, but parents don't need to turn of that valve just because they've reproduced, though I know that's an unpopular thought. 

I don't know how old your kids are, but you CAN set them up with the babysitting tube and a Disney movie or whatever for a bit so you and your honey can engage in a little grope and tickle. You're allowed to do that. Sure, you might get interrupted before you get to do the deed, but those few moments of time dedicated to showing each other that you want each other are as much sex as the PIV, where-will-the-cum-go moments.

Engaging in chores together is another good way to sneak in a little action. You can be doing dishes together and, as soon as all of the wee ones have left the room, engage in some necking and butt grabbing and whatever-else-turns-you-on-ing.

You can also make use of pre- and post-bathing times. Who doesn't like to see their SO get naked or step out of a steamy shower and kiss them up and down their bod and give them a wee pinch on the arse before letting them do their thing. TREAD CAREFULLY with that one, though. I know how bathing time can be a sanctuary for 'rents with youngins. You don't want to meads with that.

Anyways, the point is to introduce sex as something you can engage in anywhere (within reason and with consent) and redefine it, create build-up, show each other that you want and cherish each other without the pressure of needing to ""finish"" and create the promise of it in the future.

Again, I can't stress enough that it doesn't harm children to know that their parents are sexual beings who want to be intimate with each other. That's kinda what got them here in the first place, innit? You may have to go slowly and introduce the idea a bit at a time if either of you are uncomfortable with it, but it's worth letting go of that societal noose that hangs so many good love lives just because said love lives resulted in offspring.

Basically, how does expecting them to put out early and often not contribute to the cock carousel?  Because it seems women must choose between easily putting out in order to be taken seriously when younger, which sabotages their future, or not easily putting out and being considered a prude, making them more valuable when older.  Is there any way for a woman to be taken seriously and considered valuable when she is both young and old?

I understand that TRP is about self-improvement and not necessarily the grand scheme of things, and as such a TRP man does not have to answer for cause-and-effect throughout a whole society, but surely we must see that expecting sex is, at least partially, causing the very cock carousel we complain about.

Considering feminism is one of the foundations for queer theory, but queer theory goes above and beyond it with its analysis, I don't blame you.

&gt;""Men and Women"" is often used to allegedly describe all people.

Which is disappointing.

&gt; When I ask people tell me that I of course am, but in practice I hear a code-switch between feminism and queer theory that give me a twinge.


This is something I am working on. The vast majority of the world is still even light years behind the worldview of feminism so I find it hard that people will begin recognizing queer theory sooner, but then again perhaps feminism makes the reality of gender and sex harder to accept by relying too heavily on heteronormativity? Wow, you've got me thinking! XD

Takes a long time but should work out fairly well.

Will try to find a link...

edit - Can't seem to recall exactly where I saw this.  In the mean time may I suggest reading [Building Harlequin's Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Harlequin%27s_Moon) for some thoughts on the subject?

On the thought of firing canisters of gases at a planet...probably not going to work unless the planet is already massive enough to hold an atmosphere of sufficient pressure and the gases you introduce are heavier than the ones there and can displace them (not even sure about that).  If it could be done, then you take the necessary gases from Jupiter or other gas giant (they'll never miss it); if fusion technology of sufficient power and proper controls is available then you take whichever gases are most convenient and use fusion to produce oxygen, nitrogen, etc. in whatever quantities you require.  Chances are good that if you have that sort of technology you probably have better ways to terraform anyway."

Because they have no fucking clue what they're talking about and life has reminded them constantly that when they open their mouths they get made fun of. If life has not taught them this, you get to be the man who teaches them this lesson.

Perfect in my opinion (I'm not a fan of the oversized watch trend). Finally, you have an automatic with manual win capabilities. You really shouldn't need to wind it, but if you absolutely need to just turn it (slowly) while it's in the lowest position (closest to the case or ""seated""). I can't remember if it's up or down, but you can just look at the movement through the caseback while you're turning it and whichever way causes the big gear to turn is the winner.

Sidebar: it has been largely debated whether you should actually manually wind the ETA 2824. Many people have reported longterm problems and wear by doing so consistently. This movement is known for being very easy to start when fully wound down, so if you get to that point I would suggest just giving it a few shakes to start it up.

RandianHero,obama,1389399969.0,"Intelligence agencies have been doing the same thing from the dawn of civilization. J. Edgar Hoover had detailed files on *everyone* -- citizens and foreigners alike. It's nothing new. The only thing that's changed is now, information is readily available everywhere and people give it away *voluntarily*. Hell, people give away more personal information on Facebook than the NSA could ever hope to acquire through clandestine channels. And I'm okay with this. Having an effective intelligence agency is paramount to maintaining a hegemony. And if you think everyone else in the world isn't doing the exact same thing, you're woefully deluded. There's never been such a thing as online anonymity; if you want to be anonymous, don't use the internet.

Wars haven't been symmetrical in over 70 years. It's a globalized world now, so there's probably never going to be another symmetrical war. Our military hasn't been a citizen soldier army since we stopped the national draft. It's an elite, quasi-mercenary, volunteer army now. If you don't like that, blame Jimmy Carter.

Civilians get killed in conflicts. Countless millions were killed in the last war we ""wanted to fight"". It sucks, but it happens with or without drones. And since drones don't fly themselves, who do you think controls them? That's right: soldiers.

So go ahead and point fingers all you want, but you're very clearly operating on a very facile perception of how politics and the government in general works. And just for future reference, calling someone evil for holding a different view than you just makes you look like an idiot. I don't recommend it if you want people to take you seriously in the future."

That the exception exists and is noteworthy proves that there was a rule to begin with. E.g. If you see a sign that says ""You can't drive here on Sundays."" Many people would reasonably assume that you *can* drive there on every other day (except Sunday, as stated per the exceptional ruling). 

There is often confusion because the modern usage of the statement has been shorted from *""the exception confirms the rule in cases not excepted""* (a translation from a Latin quote). 

Why this is relevant here, is because it's HBD chick's subtitle. She's saying she's an exception to the rule. It's a semi-subtle snipe at other women while promoting herself... to whom? Most likely to people who have issues against the femsphere.

After 5 minutes transfer aluminum foiled steak into a seasoned broth bath to simmer for 10 minutes flipping every 3 minutes or so.

If you want to get 'busted', simply leave a nug on the counter or something. If they say nothing, ask about it, and act as if you thought they already knew.

Well, [the facts](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-12-22-the-truth-behind-retailer-exclusive-pre-order-extras-article) [disagree ](http://kotaku.com/5909105/stop-preordering-video-games-please) [with you. ](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/03/18/editorial-lets-not-pre-order-games-any-more-eh/).

&gt; ""(Reviews) can also be bad for business if you're in the business of making or selling video games, though, so removing that roadblock is in both publisher's and retailer's best interests. The cult of preordering is how this is achieved.

&gt; And it works, with many games tallying up preorder counts in the millions.

&gt; Want to know why there aren't any demos anymore? This is why. Want to know why content is withheld from everyone's game and is instead sprinkled across various competing retailers? This is why.""



&gt; ""They’ve redesigned how they fund projects, how they expect their revenue streams to appear in their accounts, around a pre-ordering model. There’s a reason they push so hard, and so loudly, with their dozen different ways to buy Assassin’s Duty VII, with the Uber Digital Supreme Deluxe version containing one more novelty playing card than the Ultra Digital Deluxe Surpreme version, although lacking the replica stab victim figurine in the Supreme Ultra Uber Deluxe boxed version, only available in GameStop if you pre-order on Amazon. But it’s a reason that is entirely benefiting them, and not benefiting gamers.""




&gt; ""So please, just stop pre-ordering. It’s not offering anyone but publishers an advantage. It’s like paying for your meal at a restaurant before the kitchens are built, and months before the food critics have been in, let alone before you’ve been able to even read a proper menu. That just doesn’t make sense. Let’s start making sense."""

In my personal experiences (speaking strictly for me), I know if it is there, within 5-10 minutes. I have no idea how or why that is the case, if that is standard with most people, or just for me. It's more than just a physical attraction. Out of the girls I have had the privilege to take out, less than 10 fit that bill. Most of these girls were pretty, yes, but they weren't any more or less than others I have been on dates with. 

So what accounted for that instant *zing*? I honestly don't know. I have my own theories, but I don't have any idea how correct they are. In the scriptures we learn that ""light attracts light"". I personally feel that ""x-factor"" is, for lack of a better way of saying it, your spirit recognizing something and resonating to theirs. Idk.

ladycousland,masseffect,1389400483.0,"ME is pretty much a breeze on insanity with a leveled-up Shepard and upgraded Spectre gear so I would consider playing with an existing character. There seem to be a lot more geth rocket/assault drones thrown into the mix, and for some reason the Thorian creepers in particular are lot stronger on hardcore/insanity so I would just suggest taking it slowly and paying close attention to where your squadmates are positioned. And if it needs to be said, save manually every inch of the way. 

ME2/ME3 seem to be more about picking the right squadmates for the job so think about what powers are going to be most effective against each type of enemy and which squadmates will best complement your Shepard's abilities. And again, just be cautious in how you progress through each location and think about how best to position yourself and your squadmates.

Good luck! Insanity (imo) is by far the most fun way to play the series since it forces you to really think strategically about the way you use your powers and manage your squadmates. If you try to run-and-gun like you can on lower difficulty settings you're going to go through a whole lot of medi-gel."

The pros is obvious:  Good, solid framework, nice community, and **a real focus on testability** (bolded because *so* important).

The con is basically this:  You're not really programming in JS any more; you're now programming in a new ""angular language"".  And it's not entirely clear that it's a very good language.  Or perhaps it would be better to say that it's not clear the Angular devs even realized they were *making* a new language.

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389400780.0,"&gt;&gt; He defied that finity when he attained Nirvana. This is what perfect wisdom means.

&gt;In a certain sense, I certainly agree, but I wonder how you are thinking about it. My understanding is that by eliminating the delusion of having a self, he found that there was no particular being named Gotama. Since his being was no longer definable by any particular boundary, he was in a sense beyond limitation and finitude. However, this does not at all mean that in forming concepts and giving teachings he had access to an infinitude of ideation or to all possible knowledge. The buddha was omniscient if by ""the buddha"" we refer to the undefinable, unlimitedness of existence, but if we are talking about a person, who still had to use his brain and tongue to form words, etc., then total omniscience seems impossible.

Are you basing that assumption on the Buddha's body existing in time and space? If so, we should keep in mind that Buddhas have three bodies according to the Trikāya teaching. With the Dharmakaya body being perfect wisdom permeating all concepts and possibilities, it wouldn't be consistent to say the Buddha in his material Nirmanakaya body was somehow separate from the Dharmakaya simply because they (we) would only perceive his material body. Like I said, I don't believe Shakyamuni was just a smart guy, but if you do I can see how easy it is to deny his omniscience.

&gt;&gt; Did they need to know about how to build a nuclear power plant before the first century? Did they have the capacity? Was there anything to use that power? Would that knowledge have liberated them? No no no &amp; no.

&gt;So he wasn't totally omniscient, he just had omniscience relative to information that was helpful for liberation? 

No. Just because I know about thermodynamics doesn't mean I would expect an infant to know what I'm talking about.

&gt;Why? I would argue that it would have been very helpful for the buddha to have given us the technology for cold fusion along with some societal structures for employing it, as this would have freed many, many people from necessities of labor so that they could meditate and become liberated. He could have invented all the technology needed to accomplish this.

This isn't how technological innovation works. Concepts build on each other over time and involve many many people to make it happen. He would have had to defy karma by trying to get people to understand an end goal when they didn't even have the basic concepts in their own head to even make sense of such a concept, let alone the materials it would take to build that, or the regulations needed to be put in place to sustain it. I think you are confusing omniscience with omnipotence here. I wouldn't say he was omnipotent--which would be karma defying--but omniscient to all karmic possibilities.

Constructing nuclear power plants, like anything else, comes with it's own disadvantages that can lead to suffering. I don't see how that option would be objectively superior to other options, or how that would have led to more people being liberated. Even today, technology, politics, and economics are way more complicated than you are allowing in this hypothetical scenario.

Since they are still legal marriages, that is what the U.S. Attorney General has to act on.  Windsor made it clear that the federal government cannot withhold *federal* benefits from marriages that were legally entered into - these were and they have not been annulled.  This doesn't affect *state* benefits (and that's going to be a huge mess).  Simply entering an appeal doesn't nullify people's marriages or reinstate the law prior to the court's findings.  That's why the specific wording of the stay is important.  I haven't heard that the stay addresses the marriages that the state already certified.  If it doesn't, then the stay would be against further action only.  If you've heard otherwise, I'd like to know."

It's a heartwarming comedic angle, but nothing more. Snake is way too interested in tits and ass, and you never really see him checking out dudes. If he was ""intended"" to be bi there'd be an obvious joke somewhere, kind of like with Ocelot.  Besides, Snake was castrated."

Bombkirby,smashbros,1389401017.0,"I don't like that weak reason of ""Couldn't see such a character in a fighting game!"" Some of the best most unique characters are weirdos that have no place in a fighting game. Fighters like Game and Watch and Phoenix Wright, etc are all pretty goofy and original. The last thing we'd need is more characters that step on other character's niches. Example: Adding like more sword characters. Stop. We have plenty. If they get a new FE character, pick one with a Bow or a Staff or an Axe/Hammer. Not a sword!

I'm trying to help you cope with the idea of Nook. He's PROBABLY going to be in this game. In the first trailer he walks by the invitation that villager dropped, stops, and looks directly at it with interest. Clearly its a hint he's going to be in the game in some form.

RadiumGirl,MorbidReality,1389401056.0,"&gt;Anyhow, since the definition I initially provided specifically mentions that murder is ""the killing of another human"", I'm not too sure where you're getting at, with your veterinarian example, unless you're somehow claiming that animals are humans, or something?

Perhaps you need to re-read your definition.

Your definition says:

&gt;Murder is defined as... ""An act of deliberate killing of another being, especially a human.""

""Another being, *especially* a human"" - not *specifically* a human. So your definition *could* cover an animal. Hey, it's *your* definition, not mine. You're the one who decided to go into semantics. I'm just asking you to be consistent.

&gt;Also, it's relevant to mention English isn't my first language, so I may be mixing up concepts for similar words which translate and/or are used differently in my native language, although that's not really the case here.

I think it may be. 

I shall have a nice day, you too :)

There's no need for a superhero to be portrayed in an uncomfortable way simply because they are superheroes, no marketing purposes or things like that. There is, however, a purpose in depicting characters of different genders in diverse ways: men in one way and women in another.

I saw a neurologist because my migraines turned into vertigo. I was pregnant at the time, so serious meds were not an option.

Said that I wouldn't see results right away, but in a month or two the migraines should be gone.

He was right, or they went away on their own. When I stopped taking the supplements, it took about a month, and the headaches came back.

I have lots of breaks between classes throughout the day, and instead of staying nearby and going to the library or something to sit and study or just relax, I walk all the way back across campus to my building and hide in my dorm because that's the only place where I'm not surrounded by people. Plus I have a single room, so I'm kind of isolated in here and it's where I spend most of my free time, sadly. 

I've been wanting to try exposure therapy, but I've never been able to bring myself to even do this in the first place and my SA has started to control my life, so I'm starting medication. Hopefully it'll help, even a little bit.

Good luck sir."

QBR is skewed based on the amount of games played really and you end up with players like Mark Sanchez doing pretty well in one or two games and ranking higher than QB's who are leaps and bounds better than him, arm accuracy is a really shitty qualifier to start with, arm strength is another really shitty qualifier, so is athleticism...if you can even come out with an actual definition of what that even fucking means in terms of what makes a good QB.

So the best place to start is to look at the records overall.  Look at their win %, look where they led their teams in the playoffs, how many times they got there, etc.  After that, then you can start arguing finer points like touchdowns, picks, ability to engineer game winning drives, etc.

Obviously football is a team sport but when it comes down to brass tacks on choosing who is the best at QB, the first question should be ""who's won the most and what did they win?"""

Girl and I know each other for six months, she invites me to her home to watch movies.  We get there, she chose all the movies.  First one, and all to follow were very risque.  I sat on the end of her bed for about ten minutes.

""Are you gonna lay down?""

""Uh, sure.""

Over the course of three movies, she slowly snuggles into me.  When the fourth movie started, she LITERALLY HAD TO PUT MY ARM AROUND HER.  Fast forward to the end of that movie, she uses me like a body pillow, leg on me and everything...head on my chest.  The only thing I was thinking was trying to slow my fucking heart rate and maintaining body heat to my extremities without sweating.  My heart was clocking at 150bpm...I counted.  To sum things up, she put Netflix on and we watched a documentary about sex.

Ready for this, guys?

*Woosh.*

Like, her signals were fucking screaming at me, swearing and pounding on my brain, but my brain decided to shoot enough heroin to kill an army.  Mother...fucking...whoosh.  Like, Nike over my head.  She ended up just staring at me for half an hour until she finally kissed me.

Anyway.  We ended up dating, she broke my heart, and here I am.  Oh, I'm a virgin.

I truly did not know that she liked me.  I was thinking, ""Is this what good friends do?  She couldn't like me, she's gorgeous.  Why would she ask me to lay down with her, isn't that disrespectful?  Why is she getting close to me?  Is she cold?  Do I smile?  Do I put my arm around her?  This seems to go beyond the boundaries of just a friendship...but I don't really know..."""

A lot of people complain that Holden wasn't likable, but I don't believe Holden was supposed to be likable; he was an arrogant brat who knew nothing about the world and believed that he knew everything. The real literary merit here (or part of it, anyway) is that it forces us as adults to confront something about our past that we might rather not think about, but you can't do that as a teenager, because you're still identifying with the protagonist in the present. Holden Caulfield is an anti-hero, and the book works better if you approach it with that in mind."

TMA-3,socialanxiety,1389401974.0,"I probably can't give the best advice because I have ~~minimal~~ no experience with girls, but I'll try. 

You mentioned that you ""get really nervous"" (obviously, because you're in /r/socialanxiety), but other than that, there's nothing preventing you from talking to her. In my experience, trying to act normal and social around people, especially girls, fails miserably, probably *because* of the fact that I'm trying so hard. On the other hand, there are some days where I'm just more tired than usual or have other matters on my mind, so my focus isn't on how I'm acting. Those are the times when everything becomes easier--when you aren't constantly aware of what you're saying and how you're saying it, etc. then you naturally come off as more relaxed and at ease, which will help you socialize better and be less nervous talking to people. 

Also, if you act really anxious around her and it's obvious that you're nervous, and she stops being interested in you because of that, then maybe she isn't worth your time. But again, as I said, I have no girl experience so I wouldn't rely on my advice too much."
runningsalami,funny,1389401976.0,"The interesting thing here is to go beyond the superficial clothing, not ignoring it, but analyzing it.

Female superheroes tend to have a generous bosom, narrow waist and large hips: the traditional hour-glass shape. These are female traits, made to turn the character into one of the female archetypes. Personality traits attached to the female gender then follow, like naivity, emotional instability, weakness, stupidity, the ""man-eater"", kindness etc.

In contrast to the female heroes are the male ones, traditionally shown with large muscles, sometimes barechested and often quite ferocious. Again, this can be understood by ""typical"" male attributes, like wisdom, resourcefulness, strength, power, aggressivity etc.

Clothing becomes a manifestation of the traits, while still inanimate pieces of cloth on the body, clothes and poses are able to tell quite a bit regarding gender. High heels vs. Boots, one type of hat vs. another and so on.

For some reason people seem to think that night is same as visibility of 0 meters which I find interesting and frustrating at same time. People don't go outside after sun has set, ever?

P.S. If shit really hit the fan, just press Q"

My partners were all friends for years before we considered dating. We had sex after we determined our mutual attraction.

I don't know whether men or women have more partners. I see it as totally acceptable to ask how many partners someone has; I expect all of my partners to be able to be honest and open with me, as I am with them. That includes knowing about their other partners, and mentioning them periodically. I'm very open with my partners."

3rd grade english. Teacher hands me my vocab/spelling quiz for the week.

0 of 20 points. 3rd grade me goes WTF. I asked teacher why, I knew I spelled platinum correctly. 

Teacher: Until you can properly spell your name I won't properly grade your assignments (I spell the ending of my name with ""ch"" but is pronounced with a ""ck"" sound. So she called on me the rest of the day with the supposed ""tch"" pronunciation of my name.

She asks if I want to correct the spelling of my name. No. That's not how I spell my name.

So mom picks me up from school (different one, public, not a slight against public schools...) asks me how my day was.

Mom goes into Hulk mode.

One weekend, several phone calls, and a dictionary perusing later, me mom got an apology from said Language arts teacher.

Fast forward 20 years later and I still spell my name with ch and pronounce it with ck.

I can usually figure out who I'm going to like depending on how they choose to pronounce my name after I correct them.

The first stop was an overnight in LA to cope with jet lag, and to keep myself awake, I went shopping. My hotel got me a cab with a very nice bloke who showed me around a bit, and then took me to a Fry's Electronics. (I wanted a new camera and a tablet)

I made my purchases, and as I'm sitting outside waiting for another cab, this big black guy walks up to me and in this deep ominous baritone, goes, ""'Scuse me! Can you tell me where Fry's is?""

Pointing to the 10ft high ""Fry's"" sign behind me, I reply, ""You've just found it, mate.""

The guy thanked me, then stopped and asked ""Wait... where y'all from?""

As I said that I was Australian, a huge smile split the guy's face, and he laughed, ""Thank fuck for that, man, it'd be terrible if you were British: that queen's a cunt!""

MN_Wild_Rice,trees,1389402589.0,"Start drinking water. Like, soon as you read this. Try to drink at LEAST two liters a day (Thats four of those ice mountain bottles). Detox drinks work, but only if you start chugging water at least a few days before the test. Make sure you follow the directions on the bottle too, some want you to drink it no more than two hours before, some want you to drink no less than four.

Also, dunno if you're a fit-ent or not, but try to workout at least two days before then, preferably a 60-90 minute, sweat breaking workout. Personally, I concentrate on lifting, with maybe ten or fifteen minutes of cardio or plyometrics. The trick is to get as much of a whole-body workout as possible.

Another tip is your digestive system- stay regular. Eat some oatmeal every morning for breakfast, and help yourself to a handful of raisins when you get the munchies. By cleansing your GI tract, you make it easier for new materials 'passing through' to absorb the THC breakdown products your body is putting out. 

Source: I was on probation for 18 months, and smoked intermittently throughout. I did this by getting in and staying in shape, ***REGULARLY*** drinking up to three liters of water a day, by eating healthy, and if neccesary, using a a detox drink as added insurance. Only ever had a single failed test, and it was the one time I tried to use a detox drink having gone a week without working out and having drank considerably less water then usual leading up to the test.

Is it a government test? Like a probationary baseline UA or violation UA? Or is it employment related?

EDIT: Forgot to mention that drinking excessive water will show up as a low creatine count in your test, so be sure to grab a vitamin or workout supplement that has a high count of creatine-monohydrate. This, along with some B vitamins, will help 'diluted' urine pass as close to normal as possible, considering you should be pissing dasani by that point if drinking my recommended 2 liters lol :D Good luck OP, message me if you want some more hints or tricks."

Increasing fees and competitors for the few networks that customers do want (ESPN and various alternatives), and the local-in-local advertising market they were hoping would save them, is more frequently turning to online ads with their cheaper production and distribution costs.

I spent some time working for one of the cable companies. Incredibly challenging job technically and professionally, but awful business to be in.

Okay.  But if you take the first step of recognizing that it's truly pragmatic to honestly consider God and religion, then you can become one from the honest exploration.

&gt; I suggest that if you can think that rationally about it then there is no way you can convince yourself that you actually believe in God.

You're assuming the belief cannot become authentic.  That openly walking through the evidence can't lead you to a truth involving a real God.  But the wager compels us to set aside the assumption that there is no God, and ask, ""where does the evidence point?"""

If I knew that I would rise to heaven and rule forever as a deity, I could care less how much people wanted to torture me. Moreover, people like to change around the original purpose of the sacrifice. The sacrifice was made so that human beings didn't have to sacrifice animals anymore. Jesus never said that he wanted to abolish any of the Old Testament laws. In fact, he even commanded us (in **Matthew 5:18**) that ""not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass from the Law until heaven and earth pass away."" Heaven and earth haven't passed away yet, so I'm pretty sure that the Laws are (supposedly) still in effect. I hear all kinds of apologist explanations for these oddities, but I'm simply going by what the actual Bible says, and there is no possible context in which his ""death"" really was a sacrifice.

It's fun to kinda know why you can be an (emotional and/or literal) bully one second and then a saint the next. I say there's times when it's more delicious to manipulate someone perfectly into a spot where you give them the most suffering when you know almost why you do it. In the past I needed to be told afterward how douchey I was being, because I didn't notice it at the time, now I can enjoy the moment better that I'm able to notice what I'm doing in the moment. If, or before, I choose to go on a path of recovery, it sure is nice to be so figuratively violent while conscious of it, instead of being like a mindless natural disaster or pestilence.

Knowing I'm BPD also makes those manic highs, like when you're as happy as a toddler gorging on something also more enjoyable because one has the knowledge that not many other people get such highs that often without having another disorder like bipolar or having to take drugs. I've always gotten the question, ""why do you have so much energy?"" or ""Man, do you ever not smile?!"" I thought it was just hyperbole all my life, now I know I am kinda unique.

And if you really think about it, a diagnosis of BPD really doesn't explain much, it's like a tautology: I act this way because of BPD, but that's like saying I act like this because it's my personality, which is like saying I act like this because I'm like this."

But what I don't understand is why you aren't up to reading through the Sherlockshire posted. You said earlier:

&gt;I don't see it being the best option until I see some evidence it would actually be an effective solution.

And yet now you won't examine some of the very evidence you've complained about not having? It comes across like it's not that you *haven't* seen evidence; it's that you don't *want* to see evidence.

I guess I just don't understand why you're in this thread at all—or, hell, this *subreddit* at all. It's fine to not have an opinion and to not being particularly invested enough to do anything about it (this is how I feel about the gun debate, for example)—but it's a bit thoughtless and rude to ask for other people to try to educate you when you have no intention of taking any of it in. When the gun debate comes up in this thread, I don't ask people to show me supporting studies and then not bother to read them; if I know I don't care enough about guns to read a study, I'm not going to complain about a lack of evidence.

Sherlockshire undoubtedly spent a lot of time and effort on that comment, entirely because you specifically implied that you wanted supporting evidence. I don't know, it's just kind of socially reckless to not be willing to put in the effort that you seem to ask of other people—especially in a subreddit like this."

Television only cares about ratings. The insidious thing is that while they appear to adopt the march of progress, the media merely placates individuals and satisfies their desire for change while that change may not have actually taken place at all.

And when TV channels appeal to a new movement, they might drop the old one, and you won't notice because you already think the problem is solved and have moved on as well."

Mzsickness,todayilearned,1389403236.0,"Depends, you'd have to look into lag effects of marriage.

**The following is speculation and not fact. This is to spark discussion and not prove anything.**

In mathematics the lag effect doesn't counter-balance until you fully sum the total. So it could be theorized that men could be married n + 1 and at the end the +1 would be negated once the last females are finally married.

If you don't understand this, try to think of it as a wave coming into shore. The wave evens out in the end. However, if you look at current trends there is a possibility that men get married later to younger women--which seems to be common place in America. This won't even out until the wave is complete. Now the human population isn't coming to shore for a long time.

It could be typical that men get married later than women which correlates better job placement/payment.

So the pocket accumulation of young females that are not married will counter balance once the sum is complete. Which this means the accumulation of females will balance out once the human race stops reproducing. Assuming that humans have 1 partner or that men select younger partners as replacements.

**tl;dr** It is theorized that an accumulation of young unmarried females will counter balance in the end, but that hasn't come.

Also, the minority of young unmarried females could grow up to never find a husband and therefore not be selected in the study.

There's loads of variables, and most of these are psychological decisions and societies predisposition of genders. To determine limiting factors for psychological decisions it requires multiple experiments with multiple perspectives. So this article is insufficient to draw concrete conclusions, but does a great job for sparking further investigation. "

My 1200 Calorie day today. 

7 a.m. poached egg (whole) and poached egg (just the white). 

9 a.m. Mixed nuts. (but only half the serving I brought)

11 a.m. Mixed nuts. (finished off the remainder)

12 p.m. Sugar free jello and string cheese

2:30 p.m. Early dinner because of schedule. 5oz sirloin steak and 5 medium asparagus baked with olive oil and herbs. 

4 p.m. Carb smart vanilla bar 

Now for the remainder of the day (I packed a lunch for work) 

I have a carb smart tortilla with a slice of ham, herb swiss cheese, and romaine lettuce, a serving of pork rinds, a half a serving of cashews, a tbsp of sunflower seeds, and a tbsp of pumpkin seeds. I will spread this out from around 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. then will not eat the rest of the evening. 

If I ate big meals all at once it'd really trigger my desire to snack/graze. 
Usually I'd eat zucchini or some other salad/vegetable but since I'll be working that is difficult which is why I have the extra cashews, sunflower seeds, and pumpkin seeds. 

I personally think as long as you watch your calories it is okay to graze all day. Yesterday I made the mistake of eating to much at lunch and then I really had to push myself to dinner without eating anything. Though now that it has been 13 days I don't feel as hungry and the big breakfast really helps me eat less until lunch.

Excessive waste, unhindered consumption and a mostly unchecked pollution problem coupled with overpopulation might make this one of the worst times in human history to try and save money by cutting back on environmental monitoring. 

The benefits of investing in scientific environmental research doesn't always have instant results and politicians are only looking ahead to the next election. Sure, creating some oil and gas jobs and growing the economy a bit will help you next election, but at what cost? It's like Harper trying to shut down the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) to save approx $2 million, when the cost to properly close down the facility could cost around $50 million. ^[source1](http://www.davidsuzuki.org/blogs/science-matters/2012/07/lakes-research-shutdown-doesnt-make-sense/) ^[source2](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/experimental-lakes-allies-say-poll-a-wakeup-call-for-tories-1.1260805) 

So basically it will cost us $50 million to save $2 million a year. That $50 mil would've allowed the ELA to operate for another 25 years, far longer than Harper will be in office. That $2 mil also doesn't factor in the benefits of their research to water safety. 

&gt;The association *representing the scientists* saying the cuts are a bad idea is pretty meaningless. 

No shit. An association extolling the benefits of the group they were created to represent. By your argument, the opinion of the association *representing cancer research* is meaningless in regards to cancer research funding. 

Just because their representing them, doesn't necessarily make their position less valid. They are not blindly biased to their stance, they are experts in their field and these cuts have the potential to create nation-wide consequences. Especially when our government is making decisions not based on those educated scientists expertise. 

Next time you get sick, skip the doctors office and walk down to your local MP's office to see what they can do for you.

MN_Wild_Rice,trees,1389403523.0,"No, these were lab tests, they had a testing machine there for testing 'dipstick' method to see if it was over baseline, and they also sent a second sample to the lab for level analysis. I will say, I was being tested for a non-MJ related crime, although MJ was obviously tested for. I was by no means smoking a half gram a day anymore, but I never really went more then a week or so without smoking either. I'd say on average, .6 a week or so consumed by one-hitters. 
Saying that OP is totally fucked is a little pessimistic, as I have also passed tests with this method for pre-employment screenings as well. The biggest trick is to provide your body with the means to use up the THC breakdowns it has stored within the fat cells (exercise!) while giving it an easy method to pass these products out through waste products. With a combination of water, good diet, strenuous exercise, and the right nutritional supplements, its not only possible, its easy. I would, however, recommend using a detox beverage in addition to these things if you are a heavy toker (I'm not, so I didn't really waste the money on vitamins and chemicals I have in most of my workout supplements anyways :) )

If this IS a government test, as mine were, throw the idea of someone else's sample or an artificial sample out the door- they will watch you like a hawk while you drop your sample.
If its an employment screening, go ahead and grab some fake urine from your local head shop, and a pair of glove-warmers from the sporting goods or hardware store. I've used this method a total of six times, all for pre-employment screens- not once have I been patted down or had any issues. "

Dantilli,introvert,1389403551.0,"Though this is damn good advice... the points you made are more to do with overcoming anxiety than being introverted. The article you quoted is actually aimed at introverts though (well... most of it)

I don't feel intimidated or overly anxious when entering social events, whether they be networking or otherwise. In fact for me the first few conversations are the easiest. I actually get a bit of an energising buzz at the start of a party or a networking event (mainly because I do still have some anxiety). It's when I'm in that situation for too long that I start to feel drained and just wanna go home. Usually much sooner than everyone else, which is my main problem.

Which is the definition of an introvert. Someone who recovers their energy (specifically mental energy) and ""refreshes"" themselves by spending time alone or with a few close friends and are drained by spending time with too many people. Not that they dislike spending time with many people at parties etc. just that it tires them out quicker.

The advice you give is still spot on and will probably help many people, but it's not directly related to introversion. What you give is good advice for a shy person i.e. someone who feels very intimidated by the idea of being in the prescence of so many people and feel rather awkward in such a situation.

If you look at pay schedules for women and men in the same field/job you see it's equal pay.

However, women are pressured by society to make certain decisions that revolve around the family.

I think the reason most people aren't put off by my kinetics is because I'm usually smiling all the time, in that way only a person experiencing a BPD type high can. I daydream even while doing complex tasks, so I usually have a smile on. My advice would be to put on a happy face, but it sounds like that may be hard for you anyways. Are you on edge mentally? Maybe the ""on edge"" is the way people communicate their subconscious awareness that you don't smile too much or that your face is maybe unexpressive?

We can speculate all day. There is nothing science can pinpoint at the moment. My personal speculation has to do with just the change in society and male suplication. Most men today don't really need to fight for anything, so naturally test goes down. But like you, I also suspect there may be some hormonal issues relating to all the shit we inject our beef with. 

&gt; Therefore penis size is decreased as well as testicles.

Dicks are just fine. Test has absolutely no effect on your dick size. You should be fine.

Q101's fixed schedule for playing the same 4-5 songs ad nauseam was the reason I found 93.1. I like the variability in the music played on XRT. Love the big beat, local anesthetic, Sundays with the Beatles...they change it up.

I hate to crate her during the day, since she throws a fit inside her crate (but she's great in it at night or when the door is open--she's in it right now napping), but I'm going to have to if I can't focus on work.  Maybe I can rig up some type of gate on that side and attach the fencing to it, the fencing is attached to her crate on the other side in a room with a fairly open floorplan.

Also, she's not eating enough breakfast.  She's doing ok with lunch and dinner, but she seems super skinny to me, even though her total food intake is within guidelines and the vet has said she's fine.

Brag:  She did great in our first training class, she met three other dogs of various ages and sizes, and all meetings went as well as could be expected (there was a nine month boxer who was scared of her).

He built this huge community that supported one another - everyone had a job either on the grounds or in the real world or both and pooled their money and resources together to live in one 'harmonious' community. 

After some criticism Jones moved the community to a more progressive California and they became more populous than ever. He was a public figure by then and a very important one at that, meeting with many politicians and whatnot. As far as I can remember, he became upset with politics in American and moved to Guyana (South America) where they pretty much stared anew. 

He convinced everyone it would be like paradise and so they were all blindly excited to go. Jones kept acting crazier and crazier and was very paranoid about the U.S. government coming after him. He was also turning into a ruthless dictator and spouting support for leaders like Stalin and the like. 

A Congressman, Leo Ryan, decided to visit Jonestown with a reporter and her crew to get to the bottom of it all. Everyone had been brainwashed to not say anything about the real conditions there, but some brave souls passed notes revealing the truth. When they got wind of this they started asking more pressing questions about Jonestown to the people there and found out many actually were miserable and wanted to leave with the Congressman and his crew. Just as they were about to leave in their dinky little plane, a truck pulls up and members of the Jonestown community shot them all down like dogs except, I believe, for the reporter. 

Once that happened he was pretty much doomed since he killed a U.S. Congressman and so he convinced them all to commit mass ""suicide"".

Thirdly, cissexist is the belief that being cis is inherently ""better"" than being trans. An example would be the assumption that all gay men have penises. A pretty common assumption, but one that isn't actually correct. Or, another example, believing that what genitals you were born with automatically define what your gender is.

One of the many things that stuck out to me about the paper in contrast to how this subreddit thinks of narcissism was the idea that narcissism is fixable. There seems to be a lot of emphasis here that our N-relatives are just how they are; they have a personality disorder and they're never going to change. And that may be true in many cases where the narcissist simply doesn't have the will to change, but it's important to recognize (speaking here from the perspective of a MHP) that it doesn't *have* to be true in every case. I thought it was fascinating that he hit on the therapist's ideal relationship with a co-narcissist, and how it contrasts from the relationship with a narcissist (especially when it came to how the therapeutic relationship with the narcissist was noticeably less rewarding).

You're going to get special player status and enter into the CHL draft, go first overall there, score a bunch of points against men when you're 16, you'll also probably play in the world juniors. Then when you're 17 youll put up insane numbers, play for your country in world juniors and be top5 pick in that upcoming draft. 


No one who is going to be NHL ready at age 18 spends ages 15-18 in the USHL or even better, a high school. You need to go to the CHL if you want to be ready at age 18.

GeorgeOlduvai,scifi,1389404437.0,"I took it as read that one would have cleared Europa as being lifeless first.  While there are plenty of Oort cloud objects they're much further away and it would take many more of them.  And yes, landing them softly is contra-indicated as you want them to impact with sufficient force to melt both the object and the crust of Mars, which is one of the reasons that using Europa would be ""fastest"" (one impact only).

Admittedly, the one big crash would be rather more difficult to execute properly (we don't want to alter the orbit too much, if at all); it still strikes me (no pun intended) as more efficient than going further out multiple times.

Since we're moving moons anyway, let's grab another Jovian one (say...Ganymede) and swing the thing into orbit around Venus.  Done properly, we may be able to skim off a fair bit of the atmosphere (bringing the pressure down to something usable/breathable).  Then we need ""only"" to tailor organisms (see another post ITT) capable of converting the remaining atmosphere into something breathable, preferably with the side effect of producing water (otherwise we're back to snagging Oort cloud objects, having used most of the ""easily"" available water on Mars)."

drummingbooming,ftm,1389404505.0,"When I was in high school, I bound during gym. I came out to a teacher who let me change in a separate staff locker room upstairs - it was usually deserted and had just a few lockers and its own single stall bathroom - but after the hassle of going somewhere else to change and then catching up with everyone for class, I dropped it and changed in the girls locker room but pretty much exclusively in the showers. Since there were a few kids with religious headgear reasons to change in private or who were just shy it was never an issue with my peers or teachers. 

It was very validating to bind and wear boys gym clothes even when I was not out - I did not have a supportive family, but I bought a pair of generic grey shorts at TJ Maxx for like six bucks to wear for gym and hid them in my backpack and it was one of those little things that made everything else a little easier. Look at what the other guys in your class are doing - chances are, they're wearing t-shirts and shorts, and that's all you need too. Binding can be a bad idea during strenuous exercise, and if you are overweight or have asthma or back problems of any kind, be very cautious and keep your limits in mind, and stop binding if you experience trouble breathing, chest or back pain, wheezing, or bruising -- but for most high school games and recreation you should be okay as long as you're careful and mindful of how long you have been binding on a daily basis."

What evidence do you have that is contrary? 

&gt;Yet again no one should be bitching about the resources being thrown away because they were given the chance to keep them for them selves.

Do you have a source for this? Also, who gets to keep them? The whole point of having them in a library was so everyone can use them, not so they could sit in a private collection. 

&gt; Also you counter your own argument in your posts. You state how the libraries should not be closed because we need them regardless of them being a waste of money.

If you re-read my post you'll see that I never took a position about the libraries. I was clarifying to you what the argument on the other side of the table was because you clearly didn't seem to understand it. 

&gt;Then you go on to say that it is good that we are transferring to digital to save money and space. You are literally getting mad at people making rational decisions.

Yes I did say that because of the available technology it makes sense to consolidate the information in order to save money. But you are missing my point entirely.

I said the problem people have with the libraries is not necessarily that they are being shut down, its **how** they are being shut down and **how** the transference of the information is being handled.

If you're in a jiff though, a length of any heavy-stock paper will do, usually about the weight-thickness of cigarette pack packaging. the tighter the roll, the less crumbs you will get in your mouth, although I know plenty of people who prefer a smaller roach as simply something for their lips to grasp while they toke."

In fact most ""magic"" tricks are about manipulating the attention of people so you can do stuff without them realising it (at least the ones that don't call for specific devices.

It's literally not even an option to me, because I think that asking for help is in a way disrespectful to myself, in that I'm not strong enough to accomplish this on my own so I don't deserve to get better.

You answered your own question right there in a roundabout sort of way. Thinking that means precisely that you *have* faced it and are aware of what depression and this self-loathing does to you. The next step is to say ""fuck you, depression, it's my turn now"" and just take the first step. Believe me, for years I was like fuck being dependent on a pill. Who knows, some people can actually go off ADs once they've learned coping strategies well enough. I don't know if I'll be one of those people because I've only been on Lexapro for a few months, but doctors and psychiatrists will usually say go on an SSRI for a year or so in conjunction with therapy then try tapering off very slowly and seeing how you react. 
The important thing I had to learn was that pills don't make you suddenly happy and take the depression away, they *should* (at least in the best scenario) help you become more stable and evened out and the lows less severe. I'm lucky in that Lexapro seems to be doing the job for me, but if you go over to /r/depression you'll read plenty of stories of the opposite...that means having to suck it up and try other meds and be patient. Yeah, it's true things could not work out the way you hope in using meds because everyone's brain reacts differently than others, but the choice is doing nothing and having it stay like that, or trying something and hoping for the best."

Nausved,changemyview,1389405263.0,"I agree with you on almost all points. However, I do think there is an important difference between a service like plumbing and a service like prostitution, which is one possible interpretation of the phrase, ""[prostitution] is both psychologically and physically attached to 'the provider'.""

In essence, working as a prostitute has the very real potential to affect your private, non-work life much more dramatically than working as a plumber would. 

To illustrate this, imagine a young woman who is unemployed and receiving welfare payments from the government while she seeks work—but only with the agreement that she isn't inappropriately turning down perfectly good job offers. Thus if she's refusing job offers because she's excessively picky about what kind of work she's willing to take, her payments will end.

So if she refuses to work as a prostitute, should she be kicked off welfare—the same way she would be if she refused to work as a cashier? Surely not! For most people, sex is much more personal than operating a cash register is, and working as a prostitute is likely to greatly alter someone's private non-work life (e.g., their private love life).

In my opinion, though, this doesn't just hold for sex. I think it also goes for jobs like truck driving (since this requires you to be away from home for weeks at a time) and boxing (since this intrinsically changes your body, both health-wise and appearance-wise). No one should be put in a position where the government is compelling them to adopt the drastically life-changing careers of driving trucks, boxing, or prostitution.

But also note that truck driving and boxing are legal. They *are* life-changing, but for many people, those life changes are acceptable—maybe even desirable. We don't patronizingly tell truck drivers and boxers that they can't be trusted to make their own life choices."

I learned to lipread very well from a young age, and a little bit of sign, so I went to mainstream schools. I was bullied because of my hearing-aids so I stopped wearing them - only possible because of my lip-reading skills. About 10 years later I accept that my hearing is getting worse and worse so I agree to start wearing aids again.

Well that was weird as fuck, I never knew the world was so noisey. I could hear my hair moving against my ears, I could hear my breathing, my footsteps, the crunch of gravel, the buzzing of the fridge, the fan in my laptop, clicks of the keyboard and mouse, clocks, plumbing, heating, the fire crackling and the tinkle of the bell on my cats collar. So much noise I never knew existed. 

I found it really hard to adjust and only wear the aids for social engagements as there is just too much going on all the time to cope with. Being in an empty room means silence to me, and always has done, and to find out that just isn't the case for everyone really blew my mind."

drummingbooming,asktransgender,1389405516.0,"Id definitely come out to a school counselor or a teacher you have a good relationship with first. Not because you need permission to transition, but because it's good to have staff on your side and adults to lead your peers by example.

I can't share personal experience, having transitioned after high school and without ever coming out, but my friend's younger sister did it the ""just show up one day with feminine clothing"" way - it hadn't exactly been a surprise, some people had already assumed she was a girl (her birth name was indian and slightly gender neutral in a largely white jewish community and her chosen name didn't change dramatically from that) and at this point her parents and counselor were on board, she had started hrt afaik, and it's been fine. she did talk to teachers first or her parents did though, to make sure the correct name would be used. however, i also live in an area with a disproportionate amount of legal trans protection, even though our town specifically is more conservative and anti-gay.

high school is a great time to transition, if you feel safe enough with your family and peers to do so. it's not that it's not the ""Real world"", but there is an element of isolation and you'll certainly be glad to have done it younger so you don't have the hassle of transitioning after entering a university or trade (or with bank cards and taxes in your name and whatnot.) plus, kids are more and more likely to be good about it. good luck to you!"

I have no problem with equity feminists because they don't subscribe to using the paradigm of the patriarchy to analyze gender related issues.

Men's issues activist like Warren Farrell and Tim Goldich, don't have a misogynistic paradigm with which they examine male social inequities.

I don't think that gender feminists have the same goal as equalist men's issues activists like myself. I think that gender feminism only defines power hierarchically, and their goal is to put women as a demographic at the top of the hierarchy."

MZago1,powerrangers,1389405708.0,"The simple answer is they keep changing theme to sell toys. After that, they run out of footage, so they need to change it up. But that does sort of tie in with my next answer.

Reception of Disney is pretty split. They assumed control during Wild Force but they didn't have full control until Ninja Storm. From there Disney went on to produce Dino Thunder, SPD, Mystic Force, Operation Overdrive, Jungle Fury, and RPM (in that order). The rights were then bought back by Saban.

Personally I find Wild Force to be a bit stale. There are a lot of moments that just feel stagnant and it was the last season until the new Saban era to rely heavily on footage recycled from Sentai. I think the biggest, most obvious, and best difference about Disney is that they shot new footage instead of attempting to place a flimsy plot over existing material.

Ninja Storm has mixed reviews because it's very campy, I personally enjoyed it. Dino Thunder did pretty well. I think SPD and RPM are the two best ever produced, RPM specifically receives a lot of praise. Mystic Force and Jungle Fury have their moments but do have a lot of faults. Operation Overdrive is universally considered to be in the bottom three (with Samurai [and by extension Super Samurai] and Mega Force, the two most recent season).

Back to my first point, imagine being a kid again. Every time a new super hero comes out, you want the action figure. That's what drives Power Rangers/Super Sentai. It is first and foremost a kids show and it's goal is for parents to buy their whiny brats brightly colored expensive pieces of plastic just so they shut up (couldn't resist that, we all did it as a kid and while I look forward to having kids of my own some day, I know that phase is coming). The key demographic is just as much 3-10 year old boys as it is 20-somethings who grew up watching it and now have kids of their own. As much as we would enjoy darker story lines geared to an adult audience, it just isn't going to happen and there would be limited merchandising opportunities. Power Rangers is retro now. It's been around long enough that parents can say ""Oh yeah? While when I was your age Tommy came along and he kicked ass!"" It's become an American Doctor Who; the faces may have changed, and you could argue it's not the same show anymore, but it's now a multi-generational experience that parents can share with their kids and will likely continue on."

mactasty,AskMen,1389405744.0,"It's just a general catch-all for a lot of traits. Combative, unwilling to compromise, a high degree of clinginess, etc. Women seem to get angriest when this word is applied to expression of emotion. To understand our perspective on this issue though, you should keep a few things in mind. First of all, this is not a word that I use just to describe women. If a buddy of mine is being unreasonable or is being ruled by his emotions, I will tell him he is being crazy. I don't think it's a specifically male thing, but I know that I was taught that making decisions in the throes of any emotion is usually not a good thing. Second thing, we are pressured from a very young age to keep a strict hold on our emotions, particularly when it comes to anger. A woman's anger is something that we are generally taught to take seriously, but a man's anger is something dangerous that must be controlled. Imagine you saw a couple having a serious yelling match. It is usually peoples first reaction to automatically side with the woman, because a man showing anger is no good. In relationships this dichotomy sometimes manifests itself as a woman showing a great deal of anger about something that doesn't make sense to us. For us, expressing real anger is generally inappropriate, so it is saved for times of very high stress, so we end up saying that you are acting crazy."

Having your identity erased, and being held responsible for the feelings you instill in men and the subsequent behavior of men (and thus being required to cover yourself up), are both very troublesome.

And your analogy to western culture misses the mark. There's still a wide-ranging of acceptable clothing choices for women (and men), in western culture, and it depends on the setting. You wouldn't want to show up to work in a bikini, for example, unless of course you were a lifeguard. But no westernized person would find it inappropriate for you to show up to the beach in a bikini.

In contrast, what we're talking about here is what some people view as appropriate attire for women in *ANY* setting. Because the focus is on the gender role, not on the setting itself.

There is a vast difference in talking about what clothing is appropriate/inappropriate in certain settings, which is actually something we all grapple with many times in our lives (am I dressed too casually for this occasion? Too formal?), and the demand that women always cover up their face when they are within the presence of men.

[SR71- Stories Tales and Legends](http://amzn.com/0760311420) Excellent read, essays from designers, RSOs, pilots, crewchiefs. Very good read.

[Hayne's SR71 Owners Manual](http://amzn.com/0857331566) By the same people that make the automotive repair manuals. Very fun book, lots of pictures, very informative. (they also make them for the ISS and the Millenium Falcon)

[The Archangel and The Oxcart]( http://amzn.com/1477684689) My least favourite that I've read. Still very informative, but I don't think its written as well as the other books. Still a good book, but its more of a historical account of the program and less cool stories and pictures"

Her husband pulls out a wad of cash in mostly $5s and $10s and starts counting it out next to my register (I'm not even near done ringing the up yet either) and while I'm trying to ring up all these different small items she's waving an add around arguing every price that comes up. Finally we get to a DVD the kid is holding (some cartoon) and it rings up one price and she's arguing that too. When I insisted after verifying that no, $$ is the correct price, she turned to her son and said ""You can't have that movie cause that bitch is overcharging me.""

So I trained, learning how to activate this link with the Xivilai and cooperate with it when it arrived in our plane. I struggled greatly with the idea of accepting help from a Daedric Prince; I had grown up with so much faith in the Nine Divines I felt sacrilegious practicing my power. No matter how many times I told myself I was only doing it for the sake of my son, or Vittoria, or Haadia, I went to bed feeling dirty and forsaken. During times of prayer, when the rest of the colony would worship their ancestral Daedric Prince, I would pray profusely to the Divines for forgiveness. Akatosh himself had given the Amulet of Kings to humankind for the sole purpose of keeping the Daedra out of our plane of Oblivion, and for good reason; what I saw within the soul of the Xivilai was horrifying. Never before had I known such anger, such vitriol for mortal life, such desire to destroy and kill and eradicate. The more I trained, the more I realized that eventually I too would have to submit those desires and emotions as well if I were to ever fully realize the potential of my daedric servant, and I was frightened. I lived in constant fear that once that day came, I would lose myself in it, and I would remain that way even when the Xivilai faded away. But I trained on, worried also that in some sort of ironic twist the gods would punish me for avoiding that path to madness and breaking my oath to become strong enough to protect everyone I cared about, and I would end up returning to the surface to find everything I had been working for had been taken away."

One of the stations had its door right up against an alley wall, it was a really tight turn, and I had literally no real driving experience. I scraped up the paint job pretty bad. No frame damage, but still. 

It wasn't my first screw up, in fact it was my third. But the other two were both pretty minor. (I misplaced a big tub of grease, and I ruined a perfectly good tire, because I wasn't liberal enough with the application of the aforementioned missing grease.)

&gt; This is super interesting and totally bizarre, so I did a little research. The idea is that a single blade would be more efficient than multiple blades because the single blade is always travelling through undisturbed air. The propeller is counterweighted and mounted eccentrically on the hub to keep it balanced. It also has fore-aft pivot so the prop pitch self-adjusts to the most efficient angle - you can move the tip of the blade forward and back several inches with your hand.

&gt; Apparently the design worked; in 1939 the Everel prop was tested on a Taylorcraft in a race and won by quite a bit. However, shortly after the introduction of the prop, powerful 50HP engines were developed which rendered the efficiency gains of the single blade moot. Considering that the balance of the prop was very fickle in changing weather, the already mechanical complex prop just wasn't worth the effort, so the design never caught on."

I believe gender-feminism presupposes that the literal or figurative empowered male/masculine is responsible for gender related social issues ie. the patriarchy and patriarchs.

The meta-narrative with which gender-feminists analyze gender related social issues is the empowered male/masculine = bad, and the empowered female/feminine = good.

To reiterate - like I said before - I believe the paradigm used for analysis is itself misandrist. The empowered male/masculine is considered a historical and contemporary force for oppression ie. the patriarchy.

Out of my top 5 favorite Korean songs, three of them are Sunny Hill's ([Puppetry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFp-ILBmgmI), [Princess and Prince Charming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG3QZHMkyPg), [The Grasshopper Song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHSEd_-tqy8)).  Puppetry is my favorite Korean song of all time (and it's a ballad, which makes it even more nuts since I normally don't like ballads).

Kota's my favorite member, she can go from being [fierce](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a_K2tUY7dhM/Tj7-NR6BfOI/AAAAAAAABUw/i-57ouwfHG0/s1600/Kota-3.jpg) to [sweet](http://i1292.photobucket.com/albums/b563/kpopwhoswho3/Kota_zps371ebed3.png) in less than 5 minutes and she's the jack of all trades (she can sing, dance, and rap pretty well).

They're probably the most-liked Korean group by the public that has never won a music show before.  Hopefully that changes soon.

It seems that the card was set to use the DVI output instead of the D-Sub output which is odd in my opinion because the card didn't come with any cables that would have led me to believe I needed to use that instead.  

I just dug an unused DVI cable out of my box of a million random cables and it worked!  I've never used DVI before and just assumed that D-Sub would work as well.  I guess I'm lucky I had one lying around or I would have been scratching my head for a while longer.  The monitor I bought with the computer only has inputs for D-Sub so I had to grab my bigger better mon that has both inputs from the shop/office.  

Looks like I will be returning that monitor to get a better one.  Good thing NewEgg has that 30 day return policy!

Men tend to take really wide stances and just generally seem to take up a lot more space than women (and not just because they're bigger, with women and men of relative size the men tend to take up more space whereas the women tend to make space). Probably not the only factor but it probably has some influence.

The actual 'crime' associated with the video should be breach of privacy, really, but the solution is not blocking entire websites for everyone, obviously. The aim was not to annoy people or to block the website 'just because' but to prevent that (criminal) video from being seen - it just seems like they had to do it in a roundabout way by calling it indecent.

If it were acceptable, not okay by any means like most any kind of violence in the eyes of society, but acceptable for a guy to use violence as retaliation against female aggressors then I think you would see a sudden spike in women getting the shit beat out of them, then we would probably start moving backwards.

Me? I've had bottles thrown at me, cuts, bruises, biting, i've had women just come up and grab my dick because they can, I've been kicked in the nuts by them and yes, have suffered testicular torsion as a result like a poster below said. If it were ingrained in me that it was acceptable for me to respond with equal force then I don't even know, I probably couldn't hold back.

Guy hits you in the face? He can take getting hit back. Women on the other hand on average are just not that strong physically. I would do a lot more damage and I'd be afraid of where exactly it would stop.

But it's not like that. At least I think most guys are raised to believe that getting violent with women is wrong and we should absolutely never do it. Your double standard has its place like most things in life, whether we disagree with it or not."

You feel like you're trapped within yourself looking out at what your outer-shell self/jailer is doing, wishing you wouldn't be doing the things the outer shell is doing, which is somehow maybe you. There's questions as to who the real you is, it's kind of creepy to have it explained.

I'm not saying we're crazy, it just seems so. I personally have had moments when I'm basically blackmailing someone who had helped me when no one else would, and more horrifying is that at first I don't realize what I'm doing, but when I do, there's a spurt of self disgusting pleasure."

My father was sociable and would strike up conversations with people around us. A father and son pair got on our car. The boy was around 11 or 12 I guess. He had comics that were grown up as well as some about Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm sure I was an annoying kid, but the boy shared with me his comics. We made a blanket fort using the seats and hid under there. I drew Sonic's girlfriend on some note pad paper the boy brought. He had allot of drawings of people and dragons. We thought we were going to say good bye at the next stop but it turned out my dad and I was taking the same next train as him. We stayed up at night with a flashlight in our reconstructed blanket fort and also went exploring the train when our dads were asleep. Early morning, his dad woke us up and told him to say goodbye to his little buddy. It was time for them to get off the train. I gave him the drawing I made. It was cool of the boy to share his comics with just a little girl he met. I doubt he'd even think of me today."

Gender-feminism teaches that the patriarchy and patriarchs- which are and is empowered males/masculine are responsible for all gender related social issues (note; I didn't specify a gender).

The patriarchy is essentially the figurative and/or literal empowered male/masculine. 

Feminism was created in a culture of traditional gender binary, and the paradigm with which it analyzes social issues is based on gender binary.
The patriarchy is a gendered term based in the masculine, and feminism is a gendered term based in the feminine.

Note; I acknowedge that though even men can be considered feminists...

The patriarchy = the figurative or literal empowered male/masculine.

Feminism = the figurative or literal empowered female/feminine.

Patriarchy = bad. Feminism = good. 

To reitrate I'm referring to the paradigm used for social analysis.

And I think that paradigm is the reason why many feminists seem to automatically assume that if an institution has more men that women in leadership, there is institutional sexism towards women. (The empowered male/masculine = bad.)"

[Even the dual core Haswell i3 4340 can keep up with it's 8 cores.](http://www.hardcoreware.net/intel-core-i3-4340-review/) The on-paper specs make it look like a good deal, but you're better off putting your money into an Intel processor, at least until AMD updates the FX-series.

Also, I'm not sure when overclocking a CPU became so important to gamers. An 8350 OC'd to 4.5ghz isn't going to yield a higher frame rate than an i5 4430, and maybe not even the i3 4340."

It is blowing my mind because she makes a lot of use of genetic data from human remains to back up the archeology.

Most interesting is her claim that the Bell Beaker people were Indo-European and spoke PIE dialects that became the Celtic and Italic languages. I have normally seen the Bell Beaker culture described as a non-IE culture that originated in Iberia. Manco uses genetic data from Bell Beaker burials and by showing similarities between the distinctive Bell Beaker pottery and the pottery of the Corded Ware and Yamnya cultures to argue that the Bell Beaker culture originated in the lower Danube valley and very quickly spread up the Danube and along the coast of southern Europe."

silly87,Feminism,1389407706.0,"I think it's more of a shift than a change.  For instance, Friends was written by a group of mainly feminist writers, and you can see those types of issues coming up throughout the series.  Then there are women in less sitcomy shows like Scully and Buffy who are known for their rationality and kickass-ness, respectively.  I definitely grew up watching a lot of shows that featured empowered women, and their empowerment was one of the big things about them.

These days, I notice less of that, but more of women being in roles other than wife/mother.  I'll just pick Grimm because I love it and it's been on my mind.  The main character's fiance is a vet.  There's nothing about the show that makes a point of her being an ""empowered woman;"" she just *is* an educated, successful woman.  No point to be made about it because it's more and more becoming considered commonplace.  I think in a way, this is good.  Girls are growing up seeing women in the same types of careers as men.  Men are also being portrayed more often as nurturing fathers, which is fantastic.  One problem, though, is that these shows ignore the fact that the sexes are *not* equal yet.  Another problem is, as great as it is that so many shows now feature women with careers as well as non-white main characters, the main main character is still so often a white man.  There's nothing at all wrong with having a white, male protagonist, but it would be nice to see that switched up a bit more than it is.  Even Sleepy Hollow, which has a black woman as the lead, also has a white man as the other lead and his face is featured more in the advertisements.  I think this all shows that we're moving forward, but not particularly quickly."

SirNuke,linux_gaming,1389407907.0,"It's entirely possible to write a WINE builtin DLL that acts as a passthrough for Linux API calls.  It'd actually be considerably easier than implementing an actual native Windows DLLs, but as far as I know there's no WINE DLLs like that. It almost certainly wouldn't be accepted into the main branch, but it might make an interesting side project.

In this case, the WINE buitlin DLL would show APIs identical to the Windows Steam API, but pass the arguments to the Linux Steam libraries, and return the results.  This assumes the API calls are sufficiently identical on both platforms, and that the Steam client isn't smart enough to realize that something's up.

At a quick glance, I suspect the basic community type [stuff can be easy piped](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/public/steam/isteamuserstats.h).  There might be a bit of pain as Valve's SDK is C++ abstract class stuff, but appears to be explicitly designed to be identical on Windows and Linux (and OSX).  [Just about everything appears to be server side](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/public/steam/isteamuser.h), which is good for us for supporting the Steam DRM.  I'm guessing the following are where the 'magic' happens for CEG:

    virtual SteamAPICall_t RequestEncryptedAppTicket( void *pDataToInclude, int cbDataToInclude ) = 0;
    virtual bool GetEncryptedAppTicket( void *pTicket, int cbMaxTicket, uint32 *pcbTicket ) = 0;

Both of which should be serviceable with a simple passthrough.  However, it's entirely possible that there's other stuff going on in the Steam client that would detect that something is amiss, which probably isn't fixable without getting into trouble with the DMCA (and likely Valve).

I'm guessing it'll take a bit of reverse engineering and a lot of elbow grease, but it's entirely doable.  The more ideal circumstance, however, would definitely be Valve writing the WINE code themselves, as it'd be a lot easier/quicker from their side."

Well, yes and no.  A serving size serious mass is 250g of maltodextrin, which your body treats very similar to sugar (it has an extremely high glycemic index).  250g of that is similar to 4 cans of soda.

So if you were consuming that by itself, you were likely spiking the fuck out of your blood sugar, twice per day.  Which is going to make you feel like garbage when you crash.  I know you're trying to give a cautionary tale to others, but really the issue here is I don't think you fully understood what you were putting in your body and how it affected you.

Also, for Mac OS using standard keyboard layouts, I know you can do ° with shift+opt+8 and º with opt+0 (that's a zero) which can both roughly translate to the symbol for ""diminished"". 

You can also use Reddit markup to superscript, such as ^ø which looks like ""\^ø"", or similarly write things like ii^6/5 or V^7 .

Anyway, I agree that these symbols would be very helpful, and I also agree with those who are pointing out the value of clear examples using specific notation when asking questions.

A properly written report would consider both sides of the argument, pros and cons, but instead dismisses the plethora of research behind cavity reduction with quote ""Below is some of the pertinent data Dean **created**"" with a reference to a bias source. Good one. In order for a report to be accepted, it must remain objective - first rule of any scientist - when this simple rule isn't abided by, it shows that the author really isn't qualified to make the claims that he does.


I'd also like to point this doozey out: 

&gt; ""Naturally occurring fluoride in the water supply is usually composed of fluorine and calcium atoms.""

So? When they're *ionised* in solution their ionic bonds are disrupted and they no longer interact to form CaF2, they're separate and if you put two powerful electrodes in a glass of water with CaF2 in it, the cathode would have Flourine accumulate, and the anode Calcium. This is such a stupid fucking argument because calcium in our diet is supplemented by almost every food we eat - flourine is not. This piles on top of the fact that a lot of the local geology of some water reservoirs is predominantly limestone - Calcium Carbonate. [We have a massive source of Calcium leeching into water](http://www2.vernier.com/sample_labs/WQV-13-COMP-calcium_water_hardness.pdf) as is (good way to tell if you have high levels is to note how quickly soap scum builds up), so adding more is a redundant point on more than one level.


On another note, your argument about chlorine being ""gross""... wow. Your [stomach acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid) is primarily Hydrogen Chloride, Sodium Chloride is the main ionic compound dissolved in [extracellular fluid](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7965369) and is used in balancing pressures and ion concentrations - extending into the blood stream, it's used to [MAKE YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM WORK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential) as a charge balancer in rest state following an electrical signal.

goywary,food,1389408279.0,"Laffa seems to have originated in Iraq (though Druze and Bukharian Jews have similar breads), so I imagine it came here with the Iraqi Jewish exodus. It's everywhere here, anywhere that sells pita sells laffa, but I don't think thats universally true of the middle east. I'm sure it's eaten in Lebanon so you may be able to find somewhere by you that has it. Also the arabic word is ""taboon"". I prefer it because it keeps everything together without sucking up and absorbing flavor/juices. Pita for me makes shwarma or felafel taste dryer.

Gwen Araujo (February 24, 1985 – October 3, 2002), was an American teenage pre-operative trans woman who was murdered in Newark, California. She was killed by four men, two of whom she had allegedly been sexually intimate with, who beat and strangled her after discovering she was transsexual.

On the first anniversary of the murder, Horizons Foundation created the Gwen Araujo Memorial Fund for Transgender Education. The Fund's purpose is to support school-based programs in the nine-county Bay Area that promote understanding of transgender people and issues through annual grants. Through this fund, Araujo's mother and family speak in middle and high schools about transgender awareness and understanding.

&amp;nbsp;

Brandon Teena (December 12, 1972 – December 31, 1993) was an American trans man, a female to male transgender person, who was raped and murdered in Humboldt, Nebraska. His life and death were the subject of the Academy Award-winning 1999 film Boys Don't Cry, which was based on the documentary film The Brandon Teena Story. Teena's violent death, along with the murder of Matthew Shepard, led to increased lobbying for hate crime laws in the United States.

But my story with my husband is so innocent and he was so cute, that I love it. Our first date went really, really well.  We ended up hanging out until 3 in the morning.  He dropped me off at my car and said, ""Okay well give me a call sometime.""  I thought, wow he hates me.  I hugged him. ...and I got a message from him to hang out the next day.  So after hanging out every day for about four days, we had a perfect date night.  Went to the beach, laid down a blanket and looked at the stars and the full moon while listening to the waves crash against the shore.  We talked for like 3 hours, then went back to his house and watched a lot of Futurama and talked for another 3 hours.  As I was going to leave, he paused for a second in front of me and looked really nervous, then gave me a quick kiss on the lips, no tongue or anything.  Then he hurriedly said, ""Good night,"" and ran back into his house.  Until that point, I had thought I was being friendzoned and he had thought the same thing, but figured he'd just go for it anyway.  After that, he still wasn't sure that I liked him, and so the next night there was no kissing.  I was sure he hated me again.  Quickly after, though, things got steamy.

thingsgetwhatever,AskWomen,1389408421.0,"For me my biggest peeve is micromanagement.  I get *less* productive the more I'm micromanaged.  Mostly I just want to be given an outline of what needs to be done and goals and then given the space to do it.  If I have an issue or a question, I'll come ask, but don't stand over my shoulder.  Work environments that feel more like daycares make me do the minimal amount required and not a bit more.  Give me space and I'll go over and above most goals.

Another big one for me is I don't do well with ""because"" as reasoning.  Is there some new thing we need to do?  I'm gonna ask details, including what the end goal of this new thing is.  If in most cases good reasoning is provided and then sometimes I get told ""look, higher ups are making us even if it makes no sense"" then okay, but I need honesty.

That said, I have worked with people who need management in the opposite of this.  When they aren't micromanaged they just wring their hands and wonder what to do.  To me the hallmark of a great manager is being able to sort out how to deal with everyone as an individual and what management style will bring out the best in each person. 

Respect me and I'll respect you.   Find out what works for each person and the team as a whole and go from there."

Of course, information gleaned from internet traffic which is captured in bulk by, e.g. the NSA, may have this information, but we are lead to believe that basic law enforcement can't and won't have access to this information, and it would only be used by a national-defense activity...such as the hypothetical CTU, *maybe.*

I recall that the pilot of NCIS:LA featured a daylight crime of some kind in an urban area, and they were instantly able to pull a smattering of video from area cameras: traffic cams, ATM cams, and so on. The privately owned cams not only wouldn't be accessible instantly because of legal protections, but wouldn't be accessible instantly because they're not on any kind of unified network.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389408871.0,"I choose my terms carefully, if I meant transgendered, which is more of a blanket term than what I want to convey, I would have said it. You are trying to be pedantic in your misunderstanding of a term.

First of all, words may have two or more distinct ideas attached to them at any time. For instance, let's examine the word ""Sex"". Sex can mean an activity, while rarely used as a verb. It seems to be an object that one can obtain. ""I had sex."" or ""She's having sex."" This is clear from the structure of the sentence.

Another way to see sex is as a descriptor. It's a category usually referring to an adjective. ""What is your sex?"" Doesn't seem to speak much of an activity, but more of a description. ""I'm male."" A person can reply. A male person has a descriptor of male in sex.

So, when we talk about transitioning, it's really hard to leap to an activity as our first interpretation. Maybe they are transitioning their positions? Our second interpretation, as a descriptor, seems a more likely candidate. What are they transitioning? Their sex, from male to female.

When we talk about sex in this fashion, it becomes necessary to differentiate the difference between the phenotype descriptor, ""sex."" and the personal identifier ""gender."" It's easy to associate with another gender, but avoid surgery and hormones for various reasons; money, anxiety, lack of support, etc. I am specifically talking about those that pursue these options."

miked4o7,AskReddit,1389408871.0,"I have a question concerning something that I'm surprised isn't brought up more by disbelievers.

So Jesus spends several *years* traveling around Judea; preaching, performing miracles, turning water into wine at wedding of five thousand people, etc.  Then he's crucified... and when he dies theres a big earthquake, a bunch of saints rise from the dead and go into the city and appear to many people (Matthew 27).  Then when he raises from the dead... speaks to a crowd of thousands from the heavens each in their own tongue (Acts 2)... and so on.


This is amazing.  Except apparently it wasn't to anybody in Judea, the actual place where all of this was supposed to have happened.  There was no Christian movement in Judea after all these amazing things Jesus did right in front of these people.  He was *their* messiah.

Christianity originally spread closer to Rome.  The converts were gentiles that never had never even been to the part of the empire where all of this is supposed to have gone down.  It took the Crusades to convert Jerusalem to Christianity by force a thousand years later...

Beyond that, why not expand your horizons and pick up one of those other games? It might be fun. 


&gt;Problem is I don't know anyone that shares the same passion with me when it comes to collecting the cards.

I mean the only way to find out if anyone plays your preferred game is to ask. I have to imagine there are some people who would be open to playing. It seems rare for a card game player to ONLY enjoy the game that they specialize in.  There is bound to be some crossover. 

How much do MTG starter decks run? Why not try to pick up that game and see where it gets you? It's SO much easier to make friends by engaging with them instead of just watching from the corner. People won't reject you for being a super beginner if you have a good attitude about it.

blahtender,buildapc,1389409116.0,"-You can get a Haswell i5-4430 and B85 motherboard for about the same price (the Z77/Z87 motherboards are for overclocking and running 3+ video cards). Haswell cores are significantly more efficient than the Sandy/Ivy Bridge cores. Also, look at [Case guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1tmlhc/discussion_choosing_a_case_part_1_case_basics/).

-Being patient is the hardest part about building a PC. Something isn't going to go the way you planned, and you're going to spend hours organizing and hiding wires, plugging all the pins into the correct slots, double checking that everything is done right. Then, something isn't going to be working right and you're going to want to smash your fist through the case. Buy beer, don't spill it, keep your cool, and take your time. 

-No. It's not difficult. Everything will come with instructions. Just read them before you start building.

-You have no conflicting parts on this build, but as I mentioned before, you don't need Z77 architecture.

-You don't need a humidifier. Keep yourself grounded at all times. [Here's a video, so you can watch someone do it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_56kyib-Ls)

-Your case will come with the risers for the Motherboard, and your processor should come with a cooling fan, as long as it is a boxed item and not an OEM replacement.

-You'll be able to play pretty much everything on max with at least 40fps with a 2gb 760 GTX."

If the porn were replacing your sex life, then there would be cause for concern, but otherwise he's just being human.  Lots of people watch porn, men and women alike, and it has nothing to do with their desire for another person.  Sometimes masturbating is easier than sex because it doesn't take any effort.  Sometimes a guy has an awkward erection that needs to go away and jacking off is quick and easy.  Most guys (at least the ones I've met) require visual stimulation to orgasm and just thinking about things won't do it for them.  For what it's worth, I used to be just like you in that knowing my boyfriend watched porn made me feel useless and unattractive.  I've since learned that it doesn't mean that at all.  My current boyfriend watches porn (though I have no idea how often) but we have sex a few times a week and he is turned on by me and has no problem reaching orgasm, so I have no reason to worry about it.

keakealani,musictheory,1389409282.0,"I can see why that's confusing, and I'm not an expert in lead sheet notation, but frankly sometimes it is difficult to make a hard-and-fast rule about notation. For example, I agree that C (with a capital letter) would almost always be read as C major, but C7 would most likely be read as C dominant 7, not C major 7 (which would probably be written as Cmaj7 in most cases). And, lower-case c would be somewhat ambiguous - online, use of capitals is dubious at best so it's not something to bank on. Conversely, Cmaj and Cmin are clear pairs which is convenient when parsing chords, so there's some argument to keep the chord quality markers for consistency. 

I mean, I definitely agree that it can be confusing - you're right that something like C#4 (is that a C# with an added 4, or a C with an added #4?) would be ambiguous (although realistically I don't know that it really appears much in real music, since C#add4 and Cadd#4 seems like the more standard notation of those respective chords). I don't know if there's a good way to truly standardize, though, other than to encourage people to notate things out, which I think is always going to be the clearer version. "

It's funny running into people from my high school class nowadays, and they act like I was the coolest and nicest kid in school. I thought I wasn't at the time. I blew some chances with girls I really wanted to date, who liked me back and I knew it, and I was too shy to make a move.

In college it was because I didn't find anyone I liked. I commuted to an engineering school and I never ended up getting to know any attractive girls until my last year. I never really got into the ""college life"" so to speak. Had a few friends I ate lunch with, then went home and did homework alone.

I ended up really confident in myself and less shy in my last 2 years of college, and I began noticing female attention and I learned how to be the guy I am today. I ended up asking out a girl I really liked about a week after graduation. But understandably, due to just coming off a shitty relationship and going to grad school 2 hours away, she didn't want to move forward.

-momoyome-,wemetonline,1389409795.0,"Love is a powerful word. It's very wise to not take it lightly. 

It's actually not uncommon for couples to not even say it, despite feeling it, because it is that significant. I know quite a few that don't. It's fairly common for one in an online relationship to hold out until meeting. Some say it every moment of every day even before meeting. 

In my opinion waiting for the right moment is the most important, whether it be online, offline, whatever. Make it have meaning to you, don't just say it to say it. Say it because you have reason to (in my opinion the other person should already know you feel that way through your actions towards them) and make sure there's substance behind the words. Don't phone it in. Don't ever phone it in like you would when you bump into someone and say ""oops, sorry""/""excuse me"" etc. It makes hearing it that much more special because it's NOT a reflex. 

We are IRL (been together 10 months) and have not said it to each other and I probably won't for a long time (if ever?) because I don't have a reason to. Sometimes it's a challenge but it makes me look at things deeper than the surface and appreciate other things he does or says. "

&gt;Thankfully, so far as Harry could tell, the laws of magical Britain were charmingly simple by **Muggle standards**. 

It's not much but the fact that he was comparing two different legal systems shows that he is at least familiar with both of them.

&gt;Harry rapidly scribbled down a legal-sounding statement to the effect that **House Potter didn't hold House Malfoy responsible** in any way for Hermione Granger's murder and didn't believe they had anything to do with it

That statement seems to be in Harry's favor. It simple stated that Harry believes they are not responsible. It doesn't say that they aren't. That could mean that even if Lord Malfoy turns out to be the culprit, he can still be held responsible. Harry's belief is not a statement about the truth. Harry is only giving them his word that he won't do anything to them about it as House Potter.

&gt;Lord Malfoy looked at the paper, rolled his eyes slightly, and said, ""Good enough, I suppose. Though to have the proper meaning, you should use the legal term indemnify rather than exonerate -""

&gt;""Nice try, but no. I know exactly what that word means, Lord Malfoy."" Harry took his parchment and began copying down his original wording more carefully.

That shows that in the wizarding world, a contract holds even if one side doesn't fully understand the contract. Lord Malfoy's attempt to trick Harry might even have confirmed something for him, that his plan (if he has one) will work, which explains his carefulness in writing the wording of the contract as well as his eagerness at having them sign it.

&gt;Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy's face, forcing himself to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his muscles from tensing.

If you read this from the view point that Harry might be the fool, then it certainly looks like he's feeling anxious about his actions. However, that doesn't really make sense. Why does he want the contract to be signed so badly? Is he that worried about not getting his money back or remaining enemies with the Malfoys?

&gt;*Last chance to live, Lucius. Ethically speaking, your life was bought and paid for the day you committed your first atrocity for the Death Eaters. You're still human and your life still has intrinsic value, but you no longer have the deontological protection of an innocent. Any good person is licensed to kill you now, if they think it'll save net lives in the long run; and I will conclude as much of you, if you begin to get in my way. Whoever sent the troll after Granger must have targeted you too and hit you with some curse that makes former Death Eaters melt into a pile of goo. Very sad.*

That is Harry's inner monologue before the contract is brought up. It is clear that Harry doesn't care for Lord Malfoy and this is his way of actually helping them. He probably had plans in case this didn't pan out but it wouldn't have stopped him. If they agreed, he's making progress, a huge leap forward with a decent amount of money for his cause. If they didn't help him, he had nothing to lose and so this meeting was just a waste of time. He'd go back and proceed to work without them.

&gt;**Harry wrenched his eyes away, up to Lucius Malfoy's face**, forcing himself to breathe regularly, not quite able to stop his muscles from tensing.

Now, back to this. If you now think about Harry's action as if he was hiding a secret, things start to fit together. What was Harry staring at before looking up. You'd think he's looking at the spot that Lord Malfoy was suppose to sign but that's no reason to get anxious. Harry's a rationalist and Malfoy is a cunning man. Harry was probably staring at something on the parchment and had to force himself to look away in case Lord Malfoy saw the direction of his gaze. He was anxious not because he thought that Malfoy won't sign but that Malfoy might catch on to his scheming. 

So from this I conclude that Harry was anxious about Lord Malfoy signing the contract because he was afraid Lord Malfoy would realize what the straightforwardness and simplicity of the contract meant or that Harry was hiding something on the parchment that wasn't suppose to be seen. Harry was afraid that Lord Malfoy would see through his plan (if he had one). Currently the Malfoy's aren't in a good position either and they know that Hermione didn't really want to kill Draco. This contract was not the Malfoys throwing Harry a life line. It was Harry who was saving them. He was giving them a chance at the price of all of Harry's stuff back with the risk of dooming Draco for good if he was caught. He would not lose anything if they didn't sign. He would not lose anything if he was caught. He already lost Draco. This was just Harry's chance to get Draco back on his side or lose him forever.

Of course this is all speculation just like your hypothesis but you see now how trivial this can be if you pick parts that suits your explanation.

* Decline pushups (feet elevated)
* Asymmetrical pushups (one hand on floor, one elevated, like on basketball) Don't forget to do both sides. 
* Weighted lunges (water jugs in each hand, or something heavier)
* Pull-ups/chin-ups
* Dips

Also check out the [body weight fitness subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/). 

It's also important to EAT MORE FOOD! It's almost a workout just getting enough food.

miked4o7,Steam,1389409868.0,"Valve has said they have AAA support, and will be revealing it over the coming months.

You're speaking about Linux in terms of how it is now, as opposed to how it might be with a singular target distro for developers to aim for and with the support of a company with a 60 million+ userbase currently on PC.

I would make a comparison to the consoles, but there can't be one here because PS4 OS and XBOne OS simply weren't pre-existing operating systems.  If PS4's OS had existed as an obscure Unix platform with a small chunk of users and minimal or no game support... and then Sony came along and said they're going to be using that OS for the PS4, you wouldn't sit here and say that OS had no chance because there we no games for it.

Valve is a new player here, so I understand the skepticism on how much dev support they can get... and *that* skepticism is understandable, but the argument ""Linux isn't currently well supported"" is just not making a valid comparison."

steadymotion,asktrp,1389409907.0,"The best way to change your perception of your self (which is ultimately what determines how you behave around girls, whether you have approach anxiety, etc.) is to gain reference experiences. It is my firm belief that no amount of reading will change your self-perception (except that you'll think of yourself as someone who reads a lot, lol). Reading can give you a guide of how to gain experiences, but ultimately you have to go out into the real world and gain those experiences in order to change your perception (to make yourself better with women).

So the hard truth is that if you want to become a baller who can confidently approach and game any woman he sees, you'll need to start gaining reference experiences to prove to yourself that you are the kind of guy who's capable and worthy of doing that. This means you'll have to start small and work your way up. Do approaches on less attractive girls. Just find any excuse to start a conversation and practice your social skills. Make it a thing you do that whenever you go out, you take the opportunity to work on your social skills with women. If you find a girl you're really vibing with, you can ask for her number. Then you can ask her for a second meetup. But once you start seeing one girl, don't stop approaching other girls. Make it just a thing you do.

TL;DR: Reading is OK, but you'll never change unless you start getting reference experiences to prove to yourself that you've changed. Start approaching women and work your way up from unattractive girls to hot girls (or if you want to play hard mode, start with hot girls and take the heat like a man). Think of it like progressing in your lifts at the gym. Start small, and stay committed to putting in the work. Play the long game and eventually, after many approaches, you'll begin to think of yourself as a baller who games any women he wants."

iceph03nix,AskMen,1389410176.0,"I had a 'friend' like that.  

We would plan a nerdy event like video games, card games, etc, and then after about 30 minutes she would get bored and try to get us to do other things.  Of course, we were there for the gaming so she mostly got ignored.  But one of the guys was dating her, so it caused him all kinds of trouble.  

I think you could be friends with them, but I think you're going about it all wrong.  You need to have a mutual interest if you're going to join them in any way that's not horribly awkward for all of you.  That or you could actually try playing.  Most of them are pretty fun."

throwawaysomemore1,SuicideWatch,1389410178.0,"I guess that I'm ""ok"" with suicide if that makes any sense. I used to love videogames, I would play up to 8 hours a day. Now I'm lucky if I get 2 hours in. Nothing really interests me anymore, it all seems pointless. Certain experiences where I did come out of my shell ended up backfiring, sort of proving my whole ""I'm a freak"" hypothesis. When I first took steps to come out of my shell I had high hopes, but now being around people is further reminder of how weird I am.

Two girls handed me an empty beer bottle at a club one time, and another guy tried to start a fight with me and my friends, based on how I was dancing. Never mind the disgusted looks I get. 

I get pissed for others when they write about they also get made fun of, even if they're just walking on the street and some dickhead makes a comment, and they mention that they don't say anything. 

I never stood up for myself, because my mother taught me to be nice, and ignore things. I sort of resent her for that, I wish I got into fights, at times I'd rather be labeled as insane rather than weak, rather be feared than mocked (never been in one in my life, which may explain why I sometimes get the urge to randomly start one for no reason).

 It pisses me off that people seem to have it made and have lots of friends and shit, and I'm constantly stepped on and made fun of. If you guys ever watched Person of Interest, I sometimes think what it would be like to be the character of Elias. I know that life is unfair and all that shit, but it pisses me off when people tell me to just move on. 

 I can understand about the ideal self, just difficult to see. As for what I was doing, back then it was hanging out on retardchan and Yahoo answers usually relating to social skills, how to talk to girls etc. A lot of getting trolled on both sites I now realize. I took a lot of what was said to heart, and frankly it did affect my self esteem because there was no real life events disproving those thoughts, so they stuck.

Now its YouTube and watching TV shows.

When you stated you bulked from 185-205 in 4 months, would you say (from hindsight) that it was too much and should have done a slow bulk from the beginning? 

I think that the first thing I want, is size. The weight loss doesn't sound to be as hard personally speaking. I don't mind looking bulky with fat, as long as I gain some muscle. I think I'll meet halfway and bulk around 500-600 calories more a day.

Beyond that, I don't think that we have a procedure for this. If there is one, it should lie in the [URC Manual](http://www.urc.org.uk/the-urc-manual.html), but there is only mention of disciplinary procedures for ministers and church-related community workers. If it became necessary, I think it would be the responsibility of the elders of a particular congregation, but I have never heard of this being done.

He usually builds mek.

No idea when he should be drafted, but in pro games, it's 5th if at all.  

Enter teamfight, spam AOE heal+damage, mek, etc.  The longer the teamfight lasts, the better.  

Yes, some things are Pseudo-random distribution where the odds increase after every failure, then reset on success, and other things are random, or as random as the random number generator in dota anyway (please not the ""truly random"" debate).

For items with PRD, the listed percentage is usually somewhat worse than listed, and the problem gets worse with higher percentages.  So Daedalus is 24.9% instead of 25%, but Vanguard is 66.7% instead of 80%.  "

Dr_Paco,Smite,1389410553.0,"I disagree with not taking towers early. It's not as if the phoenix doesn't also strip away gold from the enemy. Furthermore, you will have a huge map advantage by being able to have the minions meet in the middle and denying _all experience_ to the enemy by keeping them away from the minions as they kill each other - with the tower up, you can't force them far enough back. You'll also have more time, if you do push up, to clear camps.

Source: I have won all ten games I have played (an amazing amount, I know) in Joust league so far (the two losses I have are because Smite crashed before I was even able to select my god) and haven't lost more than 10% of my tower's health yet, usually not even receiving a scratch."

anonlymouse,MensRights,1389410601.0,"This is a general problem with martial arts. When you have a hammer, you see every problem as a nail. Here you've got people who do BJJ who only think about solving problems the BJJ way (BJJ evolved more for territorial beach disputes than actually practical self defense). There's actually very little self defense instruction out there that focuses on diffusing a situation properly (fortunately, there are books on it, Rory Miller stands out as a good author for that)."

WomanInTheGarden,AskReddit,1389410609.0,"Was raised in the church, and despite of that am religious. Let me explain: My parents were fundamentalists, alcoholics and abusive. They used God as an excuse for their ""punishments"". 
Sometimes I would go to church and sit in the corner of the sanctuary, and cry and pray for a better life. I felt God there with me. The overwhelming sense of comfort, and the understanding that what my parents were teaching me wasn't from God. Also, the sudden clear understanding that if I went to school,and put in the effort, I could be free from my family and have a good life. I think I was nine or ten. 

Now I'm a fairly successful adult. I have children of my own. I haven't felt the presence of God that strongly pointing me in one direction since I was young, but I haven't needed to. Out of gratitude for that moment I try to be gentle with people and live a life of service.  "
