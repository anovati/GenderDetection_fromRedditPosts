No, no, no.  Now wait a second.  That doesn't make any sense.  Me and my compatriots are just trying to get to the Village of Tinyton--

&gt; **Goblin A misses Dina!**

Yeah, of course he misses.  

Look, my friends and I are all at least level 70.  We've been adventuring for, like, 6 years, except for Pete who we met on his pirate ship a few days ago.  Anyway, we just managed to defeat the Sentinel of Hate at the Gates of the spirit word because Magus the Evil set it free to delay us while we were --

&gt; **Goblin B attacks Pete.  Hit!  0 Damage**

Okay, so, long story short.  We're going back to my home village I was kicked out of, like, at level 3, so that I can warn them that Magus is going to go for the Devil Crystal that's buried under the town temple.  But right the fuck after I was kicked out, I defeated the goblin king that Magus had convinced to attack the village and was named Goblin Chief.  That's why the fuck I was kicked out of the town in the first fucking place.  But you guys should know that... or at least, you should fucking know that we're way too fucking big deals for you to fight.

You guys used to fucking run away from the town guard.  The town fucking guard.  Do you know what Dina's fire spell does to guards man?  Did you fucking see that two feet away from here my friends and I just got off the back of a dragon.  Of a fucking dragon we tamed because our airship was blown up by fucking Fire Golems.  

You shouldn't attack us.  It doesn't make any sense.  Do you not care for your lives?  Do you not want this story to make any sense.  You should run away, or help us, or set up a fucking cargo cult to the fucking dragon riding, fire spell slinging human gods who didn't waste you...

wolf2600,cars,1389462232.0,"FWD tends to be ""easier"" for new drivers, but once you have skills to control the car, RWD is safer, especially on snow.  Each tire only has a limited amount of traction.  In a FWD, that traction is used for both accelerating and steering.  In a RWD, the front is only required to steer and the rears apply acceleration.  So when you're turning and accelerating at the same time, you're less likely to lose traction with a RWD car.


Also, you can use the gas/brake to adjust the car's direction if you start to understeer, which you can't do on a FWD."

With a rwd car you will lose the sideways balance much easier. The only thing you need to do in an fwd car is to let go of the gas, brake and wait for traction. In an rwd car you need to regain balance, and know how to do it as soon as it happens. You need to know how your car reacts, and as a first time driver it will take time because you're still learning other things.



However learning on a RWD car will make you a better driver because you do have to learn proper car control."

Hit with the finger half of your palm, at least at first. Backhanding is good, too, but watch out for your fingernails. Aim for the fleshy parts of her cheeks. Start light, and learn where her bones are so you can avoid them. 

Be aware that some people's faces mark easily, and she can't be all, ""It's all your fault!"" if you hit her within what her consent and limits allow, but accidentally leave some bruises or lingering redness.

To escalate, make her ask for more/harder: ""Do you like that? You like that, don't you? Want it harder? Do you?"" (Punctuate with a shake of your holding hand for extra hotness, if she likes that kind of thing.)

A great case in point would be the banking collapse. We bailed out the bankers and let the people sink. Iceland bailed out the people and let the bankers sink. Iceland avoided all of the problems of the banking crash and we didn't. there was a similar thing during the great depression - Spain's economic philosophy completely avoided the great depression while we sank in it.

He was having fun and pushing boundaries (while doing very dangerous, and highly skilled stunts). It wasn't at anyone's expense, in fact, it was to everyone's benefit. Skiing isn't so uptight because of Shane's antics. He was still utilizing his skill level, and doing things that had never been attempted before. He wasn't making fun of anyone, or telling anyone else that he was tired of seeing what they were putting out, or passionate about. This came across as you and your friend making fun of people who aren't as good as you are, and downplaying the Salomon Freeski videos (which I personally love, and watch frequently).

I liked the concept, and I wish I could have seen Hannah actually shredding it to her best ability after that intro. Like Lobido said, not many people will ever have the skill of Mark Abma.

I'd also suggest [Step By Step Knifemaking by David Boye](http://www.amazon.com/Step-Step-Knifemaking-You-Can/dp/0615116590). Before Goddard published $50 Knife Shop, which was originally run as a series of articles in a magazine (Blade maybe?), Boye's book was the standard starting point, and in many ways the bible of hand made knives."
Vaguely_Reckless,AskCulinary,1389462803.0,"Don't cook them again, that's how you get overcooked noodles. Taste test them while they're boiling and when it gets right to the texture you want drain them quickly and run cold water over them (in a strainer) which will stop the cooking process (which can continue for a minute or two even after you take something off the heat).

As far as the second question goes I don't think there is a specific name for an add-on to a dish. I'm a meat eater first and foremost so my add-ons are almost always meat. Depending on the pasta dish I'm making and the flavors/seasonings I have I will add chicken, shrimp, chorizo, meatballs, whatever. Also, if you're purely doing pasta and veggies and it feels like it's ""missing something"" you may want to add more seasonings or some kind of sauce, there are a million options out there, just start experimenting!"

We wait for like 20 minutes and a lady comes out and starts to tell us that he's charging 40 bucks for his autograph. Since we didn't have anything she said we could buy a ball for another 40 or a picture for 15. We left.

Yes.  Yes, I feel like people should stop chopping the end's of boys penis's off so that boys like me, who have normal, healthy, unmutilated penises aren't made to feel abnormal.

Seriously, the **only** reason this practice is remotely acceptable is because it's done to boys when they're like a week old and by the time they understood what's been done to them, they pretty much have to agree with it.  Because it's not reversible, and you either accept it and justify it, or spend life being pissed off.

But what if we invented something that you could inject into baby girls that would ensure that no girl was ever smaller than a c-cup.  Like some magic shot that makes all girls have bigger breasts.

Then imagine 9 in 10 parents gave their daughters this shot.  Adult women would be coming up with all kinds of justifications for giving their daughters the shot (""I want her to feel normal."" ""It's safer than breast augmentation later in life!""), men would totally defend the practice, and girls whose parents didn't give them the shot and grew up flat-chested would feel intense pressure to get boob jobs.  But some women would be like ""Hey, this is totally fucked up.  Why are we doing this?""  And those women would be right to question shit.

I'm 37 years old, and I *still* sometimes think I should get a circumcision.  That I'd be *happier* and less *self-conscious* if I did.  But thankfully I'm a self-aware enough person that when I have those thoughts I immediately step back and go ""What the fuck?  Who put that fucked up little thought in your head?""

That's an unusually high mileage for a bike, although they usually retire for reasons other than the engine. To put this in context, a first generation modern Triumph Trident did 270,000 miles in three years when owned by a dispatcher, with routine servicing. This was seen as being quite remarkable, although there are a few bikes which have done longer distances over greater periods of time. 

My own Daytona 1200 has just under 70k on it, and I don't think I've ever actually seen another bike with more miles (other than my first Daytona) - just heard of them.

Changes in hormones from birth control or other medication can do all kinds of things - I know that I'm more sensitive to things like having my cervix hit during certain times of the month, and at other times I have difficulty getting wet so that could result in pain if I'm not careful.

In fact, forcefully retracting the foreskin before it's detached naturally is what would cause infections because it creates a wound, leaving it alone and just washing the outside is the cleaner method."

luxury_banana,MensRights,1389463778.0,"Some of the oldest tales from history are rife with infanticide. Humans are in no way like bonbos in our sexual habits. We have roots very similar to that of tournament species like chimpanzees.

Infidelity is not a ""silly"" idea at all. Sex leads to children and you will not be able to convince unrelated men to bear that burden in any significant capacity. The reason that it is the norm is because of this. This is also the reason it is for the most part a norm in just about every surviving primitive tribe out there.

The fact of the matter is that until a model where women can ""choose better fathers and males to have as many kids as they could"" you get something that resembles the college hookup culture where most women have sex with a small percentage of males. As you have wisely noted depressing, anxiety and violence are a result of sexual impoverishment. This is where the whole mate competition thing comes in, and it can be and has been violent in human history.

This has nothing to do with sexual puritanism. We are not hunter gatherers. We are not even nomadic. We are an advanced agricultural civilization that relies heavily on investment from parents to become educated, well-adjusted individuals who can function in this civilization. If you remove the incentive of assortative mating for the vast majority of males who are left out in the sort of savage, state of nature even more primitive than tribalism that the hookup culture embodies, you can expect a lack of cooperation from them in making it all work.

I've experienced the same thing. I lost 15 pounds and went from fat to everyone calling me fabulous! I need to lose another 30 pounds and have not been ale to get motivated because I feel so good!

What I recently learned at a work conference that has been so true and shown itself to work spectacularly is something called micro-goals. When you have a long journey you can reach places of ""gray"" where your goals don't feel so black and white because you are already reaping the rewards of having come so far and you can get comfortable. So they suggest micro-goals to break it up and keep your momentum and celebration going.

May I suggest you set some micro-goals? From looking at your pictures (I have a very similar body type) One micro goal that I would set would be to go down a bra size (not cup size per se, but in the circumferential fit). Or take measurements of your bottom lip (that's what I call the lower hanging belly) and set a goal to lose an inch off it. I am finding monumental success with these micro-goals and they still move us towards our ultimate goal.

That being said: well done. You look amazing. A feat like you have taken on deserves to be celebrated and acknowledged. And because you have done so well, the truth is you DESERVE to lose the remaining pounds as well. 

This website helps me visualize frequently when I struggle as well:

I started with [""The Nameless City""](http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/l/lovecraft/hp/nameless/) and it remains my favourite of his short stories, but [""Dagon""](http://members.upc.ie/innsmouth/Bibliography/EBOOK%20H.P.LOVECRAFT%20-DAGON.pdf), [""The Shadow Over Innsmouth""](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/soi.aspx), and [""Rats in the Walls""](http://members.upc.ie/innsmouth/Bibliography/EBOOK%20H.P.LOVECRAFT%20-%20THE%20RATS%20IN%20THE%20WALLS.PDF) are all very good as well. I would urge caution with Lovecraft, as the quality of his work does vary considerably. If you're interested and unfamiliar with him, try to pick up one of the collections with introductions/annotations by S.T. Joshi.

I would also recommend Philip Dick's novel [Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Androids_Dream_of_Electric_Sheep%3F) if you're into that post-apocalyptic scene.

I am far from being an expert and I have mostly dealt with hydrodynamics (incompressible viscous turbulent fluids) using finite volume, finite difference and spectral methods... My knowledge is very minimal as this is a very broad field and I am just beginning my career.

Flows in nature are inherently turbulent and the the turbulence equations are not closed, so turbulent effects are either modelled (RANS/LES) or the NS equations are solved directly with numerical methods (DNS), but this is very costly due to very small time and length scales of the flow. I have worked quite a bit with the latter method for low Reynolds number flows using very simple geometries due to computational limitations and costs.As it stands, I have to simulate the instantaneous (time dependent) flow for a large period of time and average it to obtain averaged flow data, which is the interesting bit in chaotic turbulent flows. 

For compressible flows the situation is also complicated in a different way as you have to deal with flow discontinuities (shocks) and other things. AFAIK the most challenging bit is concentrated on transonic flow regimes. 

if there actually is an analytical solution for the NS equation that this could be huge for simulations as you would be able to close the turbulence equations and virtually eliminate truncation errors. It would be then possible to use analytical solutions to obtain averaged flow data without having to produce large amounts of instantaneous data and average it. This would bring the costs of computations waaaaaay down.  There is no way to stress how huge and game changing would be to have exact analytical solutions to the NS equations.

CarlFriedrichGauss,MotoX,1389463861.0,"I used to be a staunch supporter of micro SD card slots in phones, since I have a ~25GB music collection of full albums that I wanted to carry with me. It turns out that I maybe listen to no more than 20ish albums within a month though, and the pinning feature in Google Music has proved to be more than sufficient for my offline needs. I do miss the customizability of PowerAmp though, but it's not worth the extra $50 for me.

If you're a heavy photo-taker and want to keep full-resolution copies of your photos, the 2 years of 50 GB Google Drive space that comes with the phone is certainly a great addition (that is if you can even reach 50 GB within two years). $5 a month ($60) a year for 100 GB isn't bad either considering a 32 GB phone is $50 more (though $120 over 2 years sounds less appealing compared to $50 over 2 years). And who knows, maybe in 2 years there'll be another Motorola phone with complementary Google Drive storage, or they'll increase the free amount of storage to over 15 GB anyway.

tl;dr between pinning Google music and uploading photos to Google+/Drive, 16 GB is more than enough."

He was going to win the Devil Fruit, and remembering how disgusting the one he ate was, create the first ever dish that made a Devil Fruit taste good. Sadly, his lack of combat training failed him, and Devil Fruit powers alone cannot make one a fighter. His shell is cracked from the might of Minok's Fishman Karate, and he is unable to keep fighting. It was a short battle.*"

CapOnFoam,Dogtraining,1389464024.0,"I've hired a trainer for this exact problem. This is what we're doing for a 4 year old dog who has never been fully house-trained and peed in his wire crate within an hour. We've made the following changes, and it seems to work so far.

1. Get a crate with a solid bottom, [like this](http://www.1800petmeds.com/images/products/420/60178_420.jpg), so the dog cant' see the floor and so the dog understands exactly how much space he has (vs your wire crate, which lets the dog see quite a bit beyond his crate). This has changed everything for us. We had a wire crate, so we changed to a plastic crate with holes on all sides, including the bottom. That didn't work. When we switched to one with a solid base, the behavior changed *when we were also doing the things below*  
Oh, and  NO STUFF in the crate. Give him a stuffed Kong toy, but NO bedding. Nothing soft, because dogs love to pee on soft things. Dog, crate, chew toy. that's it.
2. Every time the crate is soiled when you come home, the crate gets fully washed (with bleach), rinsed well, and air-dried. And the dog gets a bath. Yes, you may be doing this every day. I know you don't have time, but make time. If this were a child, you'd make time to give it a bath. Do the same for your dooger.
3. Feed the dog in its crate. Put the food in there, shut the dog in the crate for 20 minutes, and wait. If the dog doesn't eat after 20 minutes, let the dog out of the crate and put the food back in the bag/container, and try again next meal.
4. This next one is VERY IMPORTANT. Put the dog on a water schedule. Dogs take 2 hours to process water. Do NOT give it water within 2 hours of crating it. If you leave the house at 7am every day, get up at 5, give it water, then let it out at 7 before you go to work. If you go to bed at 10pm, do NOT give the dog water after 8pm, period, no matter how much he whines for it. 
5. Every time he goes outside, give him a small treat IMMEDIATELY after he pees/poops. I got [these](http://www.amazon.com/Little-Potato-Organic-Training-9-Ounce/dp/B004I613EE) and they're perfect.

Also, stop giving him treats when you let him out of the crate. You're training him to get super-excited about being let out of the crate.

The concepts here are to force the dog to sensitize to its own urine/feces (sounds like he's desensitized) by cleaning the crate and dog. And, to associate the crate with food. Dogs don't like to pee/poop where they eat, so if he learns that crate = food, he will hopefully stop eliminating in there.

edit - also, good luck. And remember that a few setbacks don't mean to stop trying. Best of luck to you. "

Drunk driving is actually pretty popular with AnCaps, who believe that privately funded and operated roads could have their own laws about drunk driving and the free market would support those that allowed it.

flele,AskReddit,1389464240.0,"Not sure whether this counts, as it was only a dream.
But this experience has really stuck with me ever since and somehow given me consolation, enough so that I have already told multiple people about it.
It was one of those dreams where nothing really made sense but while in it you still accept everything despite the oddities.
I don't recall the details but I was sitting on a plane. Due to some prior events in the dream I knew that things could potentially go terribly wrong so I was very anxious. Suddenly some alarm sound went off. What I DO remember vividly, is that in this moment I KNEW with absolute certainty that this meant the plane was going to explode within the next minute.
What really struck me in retrospect is that once I knew, all fear or panic kind of disappeared. I just thought ""alright, if that's the way it's supposed to end, then that's okay"" and mentally prepared myself for what was to come. My mind went sort of blank and I became very serene, past the point of knowing it wasn't an unpleasant experience at all.

Sabu113,soccer,1389464444.0,"Kagawa can't beat a player for pace or run someone down. His big strength and skill is playing short passes in crowded areas. It seems obvious that the best way to make use of the personnel available is to put Januzaj on the left with the permission to roam (ala Nani). Keep Kagawa in the center where his pace is less of an issue. I don't think you lose much of Janu's ability to drive the ball up (why Rooney is so important in this team) and you gain more defensive cover and a much much more useful Kagawa. Also, I think you get a little better balance because you can distribute to either wing to run the ball up the pitch.

I'm just commenting on how stubborn Moyes is about playing a no10 in  his spot. He's historically thrived there and looks worlds better when he's in the role. Januzaj looks good running at people and has all the skill in the world but I don't think there's a clear argument that he's a fantastic 10 yet. The marginal advantage seems clear.

I dont see the logic. It just seems like some sort of weird stubbornness of fear of the foreign. Even with Rooney/RVP out of the way he won't give Kagawa a run in his best position. He'll throw him onto the wing where he's going only ever be pretty ok. "

I've bought one bra from a department store - Nordstrom's - but it was the wrong size. It gives me nice cleavage though, so I use it when cleavage is required! 

As for size, maybe 32G/GG? "

Ms_Baby_Blue,AskReddit,1389464579.0,"When I was a wee lass of about 7 or 8 (it was second grade) there was this bitch, we'll call her Bitchface. Bitchface used to make fun of me, calling me a boy because I used to actually play with boys unlike most girls that age. She'd also make fun of my last name (it has to do with farts). Well, I found out that during recess every day she would just hang out by the door and when recess was over, she would immediately be the line leader. Being line leader was so precious to her for whatever reason. 

One day at recess she was hanging out by the door as usual. This time, however, I decided to also hang around by the door, not close enough to her that she'd see me but close enough that I'd get the jump when the whistle blew. Well, the whistle blew to bring us back inside and I sprinted like a madwoman to the designated line-up spot. Bitchface was making a casual stroll to the line, and when she was about to take her spot I pushed her out of the way. Now, the night before, it had rained, and several puddles had accumulated on the blacktop. So when I pushed her, she fell face first into the largest, ickiest puddle I'd seen to that day. By some stroke of luck, the lunch monitor lady had not seen this event occur, and when the lunch monitor saw Bitchface, Bitchface merely broke into tears and didn't say a word about how I had pushed her, claiming that she just ""fell"" into the puddle. While the lunch monitor helped take her to the nurse (I don't know why, she had no visible  scrapes or marks), Bitchface looked at me. I flashed her the biggest shit-eatting grin I have flashed in my life. Even to this day I have never flashed a bigger shit-eatting grin. Bitchface never gave me shit for the rest of school. "

Here are a couple of quick ones. On my phone now, so a bit of a pain to get studies. Pretty easy to verify on your own. 

In a nutshell, dividend aristocrats have historically outperformed the sp500 by over 2%, with substantially lower volatility. This is one of the reasons I think that indexing is only appropriate for unsophisticated investors.  Just by choosing appropriate stocks and sizing/timing investments based on CAPE and  market cap:GDP indicators you can generate returns that beat indexes by 4% or so. I get downvoted a lot for saying that, as many people here believe it's not possible to outperform the S&amp;P. I say that randomly buying assets without regard for their intrinsic value is not the most efficient investment strategy.

(I could always unplug my cables, go back to HDMI and use the PS4 screenshot feature, but that's quite the hassle). Nonetheless, these should be perfectly fine for creative people that need some Warframe art.

2. Another side effect from my capture software: A small black outline on the top and right part of the image. But I'm pretty sure people know how to remove these, was too lazy myself, sorry!

3. These aren't all of them, these were just the ones I had access to. However, for some reason the image for ""Silver Initiate"" doesn't show up at all, the ""Initiate"" artwork is actually the first image of Nekros in the album and for some reason the image for ""Kela De Thaym"" doesn't want to open in full screen mode and there doesn't seem to be an image of ""Alad V/Zanuka"" at all.

4. To get the remaining bosses, I simply need to defeat those. As for the Warframes, I actually need to craft them first before I get access to the image. I can craft all but a few warframes. I can also get these images off the Recent Feeds from friends if they play Warframe.

If you guys are interested in the rest, I can always update the album (or create a new one) whenever I have access to these images."

Stop with the super rapid talking that seems to prevail these days. My mind needs time to HEAR what you are saying and process it as I go. This ""fast talking"" does not make you more exciting.

Stop introducing people and then taking half their time up by framing the question. I want to hear them, their opinions, not you.

Stop interrupting the guest when they speak. Your next question is no more important than the one they are trying to answer-if it is, you asked the wrong question first so smarten up next time.

Stop with all the numbers! They are meaningless and confusing. Show pie charts and speak slowly so I can see and hear what it is you are trying to get across.

If you have multiple guests NO cross talking (interruptions) period. You know like a five year old learns to do!

If you have double hosts STOP all that ""cutsey conversation""! It is phony, time consuming and I am here to hear the news not you two.

Have facts and don't be public relations for the government.

Talk about the IMPORTANT things: OWS, whistleblowing, drone strike  illegalities, law breaking by our government that must stop,  wall street and bankers breaking the laws. When there is opposition notify on your show how to help that opposition.

When you have a guest their name and position should be shown the ENTIRE time they are speaking.

Have guests that are truly knowledgeable not flacks we see everywhere all the time that are ""paid to say""!

When news ""breaks out"" do NOT give anything but the facts! Not guesses, not speculation not anything but facts and DO NOT have it on
continuously as there are other important things to discuss as well.

No Kardashians, Miley twerking or anything else. If an entertainer is doing a great thing like donating time or money to a needy cause I'd listen to that.

Stop sensationalizing!  A Pitbull bite may make headlines but if there are five other bites by different breeds that day that are worse stop stigmatizing the Pits/blacks/ Hispanics etc. Also if the other stations are sensationalizing (like the Pitbull bite) then point that hypocrisy (five other breeds bit that were worse ) out.

When you are talking about something have a huge map that shows us where in the world/or US this is located. Have the name spelled out too. We can educate ourselves this way instead of having this vague idea of something ""over there"" happened.

Be honest. We can't believe you there is no reason to watch...ever again."

Like charges repel and like poles repel, very small objects like single ions can be accelerated to incredible speeds by magnetism.

In an ion engine you use a powerful electromagnet to accelerate ions out the back of the craft.  Your magnet pushes them out and they push back ever so slightly during the acceleration.  With enough ions you can get a measurable push.

These types of ion thrusters don't work in an atmosphere (too much gas pressure at the outlet) and don't have the thrust to get anything off the ground.  They're strictly for space movement.

To launch an object via electromagnetism you'd need a massive electromagnet and a permanently magnetized launch vehicle.

The magnet accelerates the launch vehicle up a guide track or barrel and up to escape velocity.  With any reasonably sized launch system the vehicle is likely to be obliterated by the forces involved."

Theoretically, yes. But does HOW their brain came to be more male or female-like matter? If a female-assigned-at-birth person would be more happy living as a male, why does how they came to that conclusion matter?

Is a gay person who feels that childhood trauma contributed to their gay-ness any *less* gay than someone who has always known? I think that regardless of how a person came to feel the way that they do, their feelings are valid and should be recognized.

&gt;Since it is (currently) such an ineffective and imperfect correction, could it not be argued that it would be more worthwhile to pursue attempts to make the brain match the body, rather than the body match the brain?


I'd have to argue that you are completely incorrect here. Visit /r/transtimelines. Hormone therapy is incredibly effective in a lot of cases. Testosterone (for FtM trans folks) is an incredibly strong drug. It causes muscle and fat distribution to change, voice deepening, and hair growth (including a beard) and often, after just a few months of testosterone therapy, transmen pass to the point where people who have never met them would *never* guess that they are trans, unless they were seen naked.

My boyfriend is transgender and my family has absolutely no idea. None. You can search my post history for pictures of us.

(Ian Harvie, Buck Angel, Katastrophe and Ryan Sallans)

As for transwomen, testosterone effects them quite drastically during puberty, but the surgical therapies available are much more advanced. A middle-aged male-assigned-at-birth person can have facial reconstructive surgery, vocal chord thinning, and a neo-vagina that to the naked eye looks completely real. [Here](http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a98035_claudia.jpg) [are](http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a98035_isisking.jpg) [some](http://www.oddee.com/_media/imgs/articles2/a98035_chamila.jpg) [pictures](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Florencia_de_la_V_%282012%29.jpg) of famous transmen. (Claudia Charriez, Isis King, Chamila Asanka and Florencia De La V)

The majority of people who go through with transition are very, very happy with the results. 

YES - some people do detransition, but this doesn't detract from the fact that for a *lot* of people, it is a live saving thing.

I guess, sure, it's possible that we could work to find a fix for brains, but honestly, I think the risks outweigh the potential benefits. Brain surgery is much more risky and has a lot worse potential outcomes than plastic surgery or testosterone injections. Especially given the success rate of a social/medical transition.

TL;DR - transitioning probably isn't actually as ineffective or imperfect of a solution as you think it is. Many trans people live very happy stealth lives as their chose gender.

&gt;The British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew (including a loader) after risk analysis of the incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that auto-loaders reduced battlefield survivability. Mechanical failure and the time required for repair were prime concerns.

&gt;Similar to every British tank since the Centurion, and most other British AFVs, Challenger 2 contains a boiling vessel (BV) also known as a kettle or bivvie for water which can be used to brew tea, produce other hot beverages and heat boil-in-the-bag meals contained in ration packs.[13] This BV requirement is general for armoured vehicles of the British Armed Forces, and is unique to the armed forces of the UK.

Cassiuz,askscience,1389465557.0,"This question seems to come up quite a lot, so I've copied an answer I posted a few days back:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercooling

Basically you can think of it as a liquid that has gone below (or just to) its freezing point, but hasn't actually frozen solid, yet. This can happen if there's not a seed crystal to start the solidifying transition off. When you dropped the bottle either the impact lining up a few water moelcules, or a small particulate in the water caused the whole thing to begin freezing around that point. Due to the already cold enough temperature of the water, the whole thing freezes very quickly.
There's a lot of videos around about this, it's quite a cool trick to see! Veritassium on youtube has a great video on this (as well as LOTS of other very well made and very interesting science videos).

danshaffer96,AskReddit,1389465591.0,"I don't really understand what point you're trying to make. Is it basically ""If God wrote the Bible with inaccurate historical facts, then the faith-related things must also be wrong""? If so, I don't think you're really understanding the Bible.

First of all, ""An omnipotent god couldn't get that bit right"" makes it sound like you think God wrote the Bible himself. That's incorrect, obviously. Catholics believe that the Holy Spirit worked through the human authors. There's been a couple heresies surrounding this point, one of which you seem to believe. That is, it is incorrect that God dictated the Bible to human ""secretaries"".

Really, God ""inspired"" the authors of the various books of the Bible. Of course, the authors had their own goals in writing their books. For example, John writing the Book of Revelation. It was a huge metaphor for the Roman empire of the time. While it did serve that purpose John wanted it to serve, it also served God by containing factual faith. Thus, it can still be considered ""word of God"".

TL;DR: God doesn't write the Bible, and he doesn't care if the writers of the Bible get little stuff wrong/say things to serve their own purposes, as long as the truths of faith are still correct."

screenmagnet,Pegging,1389465608.0,"Does she do other anal/prostate play on you? I am extremely open minded, and I even had a pegging kink before I ever met my bf. In fact, I was the one who brought up pegging in our relationship (asked him to watch bend over boyfriend with me 2 weeks after we started dating). And even I needed 4 years to fully work up to pegging him. During those four years, I did lots of prostate play on him using fingers and toys, during blow jobs and PIV sex and as foreplay for regular PIV sex. All that prostate play gradually made us both more comfortable with taking pegging from a fantasy to a reality.

Does she know about prostate massage? Educate her about the prostate, and then ask her to slip a finger in and massage it during a blow job. When she sees how much pleasure you get from that, she may gradually become more open to the idea of pegging. Also, when she sees that doing anal play on you doesn't take over the rest of your sex life, that will reassure her as well."

You need to balance the clutch engaging more with more welly on the accelerator - not too much, or you over-rev and sound like a twat (or get wheelspin), but just enough to keep going.  Do it a few times and you'll get the hang of it.

This is, of course, assuming a flat surface.  If you're going uphill you need more revs and a higher clutch.  The amount the clutch needs to be higher depends on the slope of the hill - you only really get that from practise and getting a feel for the car."

komnenos,AskMen,1389465908.0,"Oh jeez it happened this summer.  I hope its alright if I put down a few experiences with her.

We were taking an intensive language course over the summer and everyone in the class got really close.  She and I were no different.  One night around two weeks into class I get off work late one night, turn on my phone and I notice I've gotten several messages from her ""where are uuuuu?""  I start talking with her, turns out someone in our class started a party and she was wondering why I wasn't there.

Another time she and I were working on a skit. I'm really slow when it comes to languages so she gave me extra help.  We started working at around four in the afternoon and worked until twelve at night making sure I knew every part of that skit.  She was incredibly touchy that night, when I got something wrong she would touch me (thigh, hip, head, arm, shoulder, footsy etc.) and tell me to do it again.  Once when I was writing something down on the wall and got it wrong she gave me a smart smack to the butt!

We got to 'studying' everyday where we mostly talked about everything besides the language we were learning.  Again she was very touchy.  At one point she looked at me, held my hand and told me that I was ""more then a friend to her.""  She also told me she had feelings for me and told me several words in her native language for how she felt about me.

I remember at our first party together she came up to me.  ""Komnenos, I'm going to get you drunk!""  she brought out a huge glass and proceeded to put all sorts of stuff in it.  Needless to say within an hour and a half I was throwing up.  She felt bad about it and the entire time she held my hand, massaged my back and told me everything was going to be okay and I would be all right.  Eventually before I passed out she led me to a bed and tucked me in.

At our next party I moderated myself far more.  We held hands and at one point I kissed her.  She smiled at me and put her head on my chest.  Haha at one point she looked up at me and told me I should get snapchat so she could give me ""naughty pictures.""

I remember one day we sat on a bench talking about growing up for about two hours.  The sun was bright and she wore a beautiful white dress.  She told me about abuse, how her father moved her brother, mother and her to America so he could fuck his secretaries in Korea.  She went into all sorts of details about abuse and just growing up on the wrong side of the tracks.

When our class finally ended we went to a party, when it was done she drove me home (she was the designated driver) I told her that I enjoyed being with her and I wanted to see more of her when she got back (she was going to see family abroad for a month).  She smiled and said ""of course.""

Well a month goes by, I talk with her several times on Facebook and when she gets back I ask her if we could go do something.  She told me ""Komnenos, I looked through your messages and well... I hope I'm getting the wrong vibe here because to be honest I don't feel that way towards you at the moment.  I hope I'm wrong and you can just dismiss this as me just being silly :).""

I was devastated and told her how I felt towards her, I recounted our numerous shared memories and how much they meant for me.  She told me she did have feelings for me and she does care for me, but just not in ""that way.""  We talked for a bit and then she gave me a message ""good luck!""  I cried.  Depression set in and I was depressed for three or so months.  I've dream't of her several times but when I wake up I realize I still haven't seen her in person since august 23rd.

It was a parent-teacher meeting all the student's apparently get at the end of the year to talk about the student's progress. We had two interpreters going for this meeting: one in ASL and me in Spanish because the parents only spoke Spanish. 

At one point the parents talked about their teenage son's home life and how difficult it had always been because of language barriers between everyone, and communication was often impossible without the help of their hearing daughter who knew ASL, English, and Spanish, and how their son had basically given up trying. The parents did know a few signs and had made up a few of their own as well, but for the most part they just had no way to learn because ASL classes conducted in Spanish just don't exist here and just learning basic English was a hard enough struggle. Likewise the son could not understand a lick of Spanish despite everyone's efforts in the family. 

I still think about that day sometimes and wonder how that family is doing. Even with the language barriers there was obviously a lot of love in that family and concern that the son got the best opportunities possible. "

Either full-zerker builds are viable in PvE, or they are not. Right now, they are viable. (Meaning you can go into a dungeon with a full zerker party, and as long as you're a decent player and know the dungeon, you'll just fine).

If they make it so full-zerker people can't survive, the only effect is to screw over people who already bought that gear, and to slow down how fast dungeons can be done. It would *STILL* be beneficial to be as heavily zerker as you can be, while surviving.

You cannot possibly guess what the tax code is going to be 30-40 years down the road.

thingstodoindenver,Frugal,1389466187.0,"Where in Maryland are you buying? Do you want a detached house?  Do you plan to live in Baltimore area?  Frederick?  Towson/Hunt Valley?  Silver Spring? Rockville? Laurel? Glen Burnie? Pasadena? Annapolis?  All of these places have great +s and -s

$250k isn't much in many parts of central Maryland for a detached house. The house mortgage is going to be about ~550/month per 100k PLUS taxes and insurance and, depending on where you live, a owner's association fee so at 250 you'll be spending about $1500-1800/month. A lot but awesome compared to renting a crappy apartment around here.  You'll have luck east of the bridge and in southern Maryland but Baltimore/Silver Spring/Laurel/Severn and you'll need to look into serious fixer-uppers, I believe.  In Howard County, 250 will barely buy a decent townhouse and certainly not one that doesn't need work done but HC is one of the most expensive places to live in the country.

Best advice I can give you:

* Shop and shop and shop and shop.  Your realtor is gonna wanna show you 3-4 houses and get you to pick one.  
* Don't sign an exclusive agreement with a realtor at least until you get to know them.  If they insist that you sign the agreement before showing you anything at all then find someone else as this person only cares about their commission.  Don't be afraid to look at a bunch of places if for no other reason than to figure out what you can live with and what you can't in your price range.
* Most importantly:  don't let the anyone talk you into buying something you don't want. (Personally, i had an awesome agent who was super patient and really seemed to be concerned about me getting a great house for a great price. She didn't make me sign the exclusive agreement until I submitted my first offer, which is actually required by law.  These people are out there.)
* Think about your commute(s) and what you're willing to drive every day to save a couple of hundred dollars a month in mortgage payments. You *will* think about this every day you are stuck in an hour+ commute each way. Personally, I was happy to pay $500 more a month for my place.
* Try to go by the place(s) you like in non-'work' hours, especially after 7.  Is there parking?  Noise?  Lot's of kids?  Are the street lit well?  How do the neighbors tend their places (Trash?  decent yard? House maintenance? You will live next to them for a long time.)  How close is the nearest grocery store?  If you are really isolated quick trips to the store for lazy meals or 'I forgot something' shopping will be annoying.  Don't be afraid to knock on a neighbors door to talk to them.  If they aren't willing to talk to you at all is that someone you want to live next to?
* Carpet and wall colors just don't matter and are easily changed, at least eventually (really).  Weird layouts and very old amenities might not be.
* Open cabinet doors, closets, appliances.  Seriously, especially if they are brand new.  You will be amazed at what sellers will stick people with, functionally, in an effort to sell their house.  I've seen brand new appliances that couldn't open all the way because they didn't fit with the new cabinets.
* Make sure the inspector checks for aluminum wiring.  TONS of houses in this area have it (that were built in the 70s) and it will need to be mitigated.
* Unless the grade of the area is fairly flat check for dirt and water runoff.  The back of my yard slopes up and when it rains I get a torrent of water in my back yard. Fortunately, the previous owners did a great job of grading and ditching the flow ... it could be much worse.  But in my front yard there was a wash of dirt over the sidewalk that I eventually had to fix to keep from getting muddy shoes every time it rained.  (I wear expensive shoes.  I am shoe snob.)

I am sure I have other tips but those are things I can think of off the top of my head.

Good luck!"
bosh-head,Guildwars2,1389466187.0,"I don't get what the point of all those changes would be. Even if they did all the changes you said, it would still be beneficial to be as heavily zerker as possible. If being 100% zerker becomes un-survivable, then ""max zerker"" would simply be re-defined to say, having 50% of your gear be zerker. And people would still aim for that, so that they could complete dungeons as fast as possible.

Different skill levels exist in the game. People who are higher-skilled players (they can dodge and use other damage mitigation skills appropriately, they know the content of the dungeon) SHOULD be able to wear more DPS gear, and thus get things done faster... otherwise, what's the point?"

We don't know that the trainers were abusive towards the lion and even if they were I don't think we should wish that kind of death on them. It's a horrible tragedy all around, and I am as much against keeping wild animals in captivity for entertainment purposes as the next guy, but people really need to take a step back and consider whether a living human being really deserves to have their head gnawed off by a lion."

But when it rains, water gets down in the cracks in the road, and the oily stuff floats to the top, getting the roads nice and lubed up.

Of course, this washes away after a while if it keeps raining, but if it's the first time it has rained for a while, you might want to take it a bit slow, since you won't have very good traction.

The pass rush played a huge part that game as well and possibly more so than the secondary. On the other side for the Hawks, Pete will do everything he can to prevent a shootout. That hinges on marshawn getting good yards to hopefully control the clock. 

Regarding Sherman and the other cbs, Sherman likes to keep a step ahead wrs whereas Maxwell purposely keeps a step behind so as to close. That's bit Maxy in the ass a few times but everytime Brees threw on him last time it was an Int or pd. So im not too worried about Maxy although by the second half brees was trying to come back and those throws were out of desperation. Im worried about Winfield on Lance the most.

acsempronio,skyrim,1389466338.0,"To MO: no.  You would have to reinstall... but that's a good thing.  Here's why:

NMM makes volatile changes, which means it install;s the mods to your game folder and any subsequent mod that may overwrite a previous mod's texture, or mesh, or what have you, will do so if you tell it.

This means that if you install a mod (say, SkyrimHD 2K) and then want to install another, (like Vivid landscapes) afterwards, NMM will ask ""... overwrite?""  If you say yes, the files that SkyrimHD 2K had are gone unless you re-install SkyrimHD 2K to reclaim those files.

With MO, it installs each mod in it's own folder in the MO directory.  You can then order them in any order you want.  When you load a game, it sort of fake installs the mods when you run the game.  IT does this by simply loading the textures, meshes, etc. int he order you put them, but never overwrites anything.

Some mods recommend their mod be loaded before or after other mods.  With MO, you can order them this way and if you decide to get rid of that mod, you can without damaging the others.

It also syncs with BOSS to order your ESP files correctly and it allows you to run TES5Edit from within.  You can also create profiles and assign shortcuts to them, so if you wanted to play a massive graphics session with ENB and everything, you could load that profile.  If you wanted to instead load a profile you use to test how mods look or act in the game, you can create profiles for that too.

MO also doesn't require that you use any mod... so you can uncheck them without uninstalling them allowing you to use or not use textures, meshes, etc.

MO uses NMM login info to sync withthe website, so when you click ""Download with Manager"" it goes to MO instead of NMM."

Roninspoon,Bladesmith,1389466470.0,"You can literally do every bit of knife making by hand with simple hand tools, but the trade off is in calories. There is very little specialized equipment *needed* beyond files. So when you're budgeting, the balance is in calories versus time, and not inconsequentially, in attention level.

A fairly clear trend with equipment procurement in knife making, is to buy cheap power tools to get started, then eventually replace them with more expensive and better versions, after which you spend a lot of time advising people to never buy cheap tools.

If you're doing stock reduction knives, I'd say the two most important power tools to procure are a drill and a grinder/sander of some kind. You can start off with a top of the line Burr King, build your own from scrap, or buy a cheap 1"" belt sander from Harbor Freight. Or you could just use sand paper and files. All of those are valid decisions that have their own consequences. None of those consequences have to do with the eventual product, they just relate to the balance of money versus calories.

I'm not sure that answered your question, but I think what I'm getting at is; buy the equipment you can afford, replace them after they stop doing what you want. If you're asking for priorities on tool purchases, I think mine would be;

* Files
* Hacksaw
* Drill
* Belt sander
* Band Saw
* Grinder
* Drill Press
* Mill platform for Drill Press
* Mill
* 38' Cabin Cruiser with diesel screws"

goundo,climbing,1389466563.0,"So, the general consensus with blisters is: if they are going to pop due to continued strain, lance them with a sterile needle, massage out the fluid, and treat it like an open wound (washing, etc); if you will change your actions so that the blister will not pop, then leave it as is.

Blisters form when there is excessive rubbing on the skin. Blisters are the body's defense mechanism, putting a cushion of fluid between the outer, tougher layer of skin, and the more delicate skin below it. So the pus is actually a good thing - it means your body is working correctly.

However, a blister that is torn open is more likely to get infected than one that is lanced but it still has the same chance of getting infected as, say, a skinned knee - NBD. The real reason you would want to lance a blister is because the pus is stretching the skin out, making it thinner and more likely to tear, while it will be less painful and heal faster if you still have an outer layer of skin, rather than an open wound."

Toby-one,europe,1389466584.0,"Events like the red wedding were not all that common but there are several events in medieval history that are similar. During the Stockholm Bloodbath the noblemen of Sweden were invited to a great party to celebrate that they had achieved a favourable peace with the Danes.The peace accord involved immunity for all the nobles involved that were still alive so people were shocked when Danish soldiers stormed in and seized a bunch of Nobles who were then put on trial for heresy and executed. Heresy had not been part of the immunity deal, which just goes to show never trust a priest.

Interestingly enough Erik Johansson father of Gustav Vasas was late for this banquet and when he arrived at the great hall the doors were already locked but he simply pounded on the doors demanding to be let inside by the Danish soldiers... Gustav Vasa, who could not attend because he had just escaped from a Danish prison, would eventually lead the rebellion against the Danes and become the first King of modern Sweden.

Also when Vlad III Tepes became voivode of Wallachia his first order of business was to invite all the great Boyars to a big feast and when they were drunk his guard stormed in and arrested everyone then he executed them and gave their positions to lower Nobles, foreigners, and commoners because he felt he could trust them more than the Boyars who he felt were responsible for the murder of his father and brother."

I also don't agree that 10 got a happy ending. Meta crisis Doctor wasn't convenient, he was an abomination born out of war and pain (much like 9). The only convenient thing about that situation was that Rose was there to help him, much like she helped 9. Plus, 10 wasn't the one who got to live his life with Rose like he wanted so he really drew the short straw..."

kakersdozen,AskReddit,1389466705.0,"Again, THIS.

Honestly, I've experienced missing the memories/feelings with almost all of my relationships, to varying degrees. When they ended, regardless of who did it, I would think about was how sad I was that we would never _insert activity_ again. I thought it meant that I missed the person. I didn't. I missed the idealized, happy times and feeling loved. I didn't want the person, I wanted the love. I was just chasing a feeling.

Generic ""you"" here, not specifically you, OP:

Once you realize you miss the memories and the feelings, not the person, it gets so much easier. You realize all the shitty things they've done to you, the shitty way they made you feel. You realize that for the five times you felt amazing, there were 500 times you felt like shit due to the direct actions of that person. You realize that you were clinging to a few moments of light in a tunnel of darkness. Once you do, it gets so much better. You'll eventually wonder why/how you put up with the bullshit for so long and why you didn't go after something better.

Yes, atheism is a ""dis-belief"" or ""lack of belief"", period. Atheism is the neutral stance from which you can go nearly any direction, it's the default position. The simplest argument I can think of for what term to use is if you see a newborn child, or you meet someone who has never heard of religion or deities, or anything of the sort, what are they? People like to play with the term atheism and bend it with semantics, but atheism is ""without God"". People need to either take it as it is, or come up with some clever new name for lack of belief that doesn't bear the negative connotations and history associated with atheism.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389467004.0,"Ok, first of all, I'm gonna say non libertarians are not entirely anti free market. We are not communists who want a planned economy, blah blah blah. 

We understand that competition spurs innovation. We just don't think this attitude of no government is gonna produce good results. Speaking for myself, I think capitalism is exploitative. While it may be good at producing wealth and giving us new technologies...remember that many of those technologies are built with sweatshop labor.

Here's the thing, there's no good way to get rid of capitalism at this time. But that doesn't mean we should just let capitalism run its course. Here's the thing, while economic models portray suppliers and customers negotiating to reach deals mutually beneficial, don't forget that this doesn't mean the deals are necessarily good for both parties, or good to an equal degree. The deck is stacked. People on one side often have no bargaining power, and are basically given ultimatums, because, guess what, if you don't do what they say, they'll get someone else. One side often deals with a lot more competition (workers and customers for instance) than the other side (suppliers and employers). This is because the latter are more educated and realize that ""price wars"" are a race to the bottom in which everyone loses. They also are generally on the side that benefits most so they can afford to keep their prices relatively high because it'll bring in more money than competition will...in a lot of industries, competition isn't anywhere near as cutthroat as it is among workers and customers. Because people are desperate and generally less educated on the other side, and because many of them aren't unionized any more, they'll be more likely to take what they can get and undercut everyone else to get the best deal. It's like the prisoner's dilemma someone mentioned in another topic. Businesses and employers arfe more likely to be cooperative because they know it's in their best interests, while on the worker/customer side, things are a lot more back stabby, and therefore, everyone loses. 

The thing is, we need government intervention to ensure that workers are treated fairly, heck, since I'm also a subscriber of r/basicincome, i'd argue we need a solid government made safety net to ensure that workers are less desperate and have more power to say no. Libertarians love to talk about how bad the government is, and while I admit, it's not perfect, the solution isn't to get rid of it. It's to improve what's wrong with it. Most libertarian criticisms against OUR government (aside from the nutty ""men with guns"" stuff) are criticisms not against government itself, but our way of doing things. 

The whole ""let people do it themselves"" argument just doesnt hold water because employers dont pay their workers enough for them to even HAVE a good retirement half the time. Moreover, libertarians seem to want to DISMANTLE social security, which FORCES the ponzi scheme onto people. You're literally proposing taking away from that which people paid in their whole lives.

Anyway, also, is it social security that's bad, or is it our WAY of doing social security? It's a ponzi scheme partially because those on the right don't want to raise taxes to pay for it. Because ""small gubmint."" Seriously...the attitudes that social security is bad....fuels the fact that social security is bad. The reason social security is in trouble is because small government ideologues would rather dismantle the whole program rather than save it, because they're anti tax and anti social safety net. 

Also, charity is a horrible approach to dealing with the poor. We've had charity for forever, and it's never enough. The thing is, people are greedy, and this whole idea of stacking the rules of the game in some peoples' favor, and expecting them to VOLUNTARILY give everyone else stuff doesn't work. It doesn't work with jobs, and it doesn't work with charity. Almost every problem with our economy, IMO, can be traced back to the fact that we don't want to just transfer money, but because we expect those who have to just let it trickle down to those that don't. What we've seen is people are self interested, and wealth just gets sucked up to the top like it has over the past 30-40 years.

At this point, you seem to be wondering what I AM for. Now, I dont represent the people of this board, I have my own ideas, but I'd say my ideas are closest to European style social democracy.

I want an underlying capitalist system, because flaws and all, it's the best way to grow economies and stuff. However, I want regulations to deal with the problems that happen with capitalism naturally, and I want generous social safety nets to help the poor and give them a sense of security, and also to increase their bargaining power in the labor market since they would them have more of an opportunity to say ""no"", and argue for higher wages. You're never gonna get this with the free market deciding, because the ""free market"" is inherently exploitative of the poor. I'd also proposed some LIMITED forms of socialism in some markets where the case can be made that it would be better than a capitalist system. healthcare is the big one. Now, I know you're gonna say government is responsible for healthcare problems, and that might be true to some degree, but we have two dozen relatively socialist healthcare systems that produce better results for the average person than ours does. We have the quality of care, but many can't properly access it because it's too expensive. And I'll take a single payer or similar universal healthcare system that is shown to work over some ""free market"" solution that's shown to not. Because let's face it, part of the reason people can't afford healthcare is it's treated like a commodity it's okay to exclude people from.

I know this is kind of all over the place, not very organized, but it should give you a main idea of what my ideas are. It's not that I'm necessarily anti free market or anti capitalist, I think that both are necessary to SOME degree, it's that I just can't support a purely capitalist system with no government intervention at all, and to suggest such a thing sounds crazy."

&gt; Find out what exactly you want to do long term. Do you want to write programs and become a developer? Do you want to be QA? System Administrator? Windows or Linux? Having the answers to these questions will definitely help.

Is there some resource that you know of that will help me figure out what I want to do? I don't really have a good idea of what all the options are, or even what they all mean. Is there a place that gives basic descriptions of the different possibilities in non technical terms. I've looked at some job listings, but the descriptions are usually over my head and I still don't really know what those jobs would be like.

One of my concerns is not knowing what I need to know to do the job. Like, I'm worried that I'm going to get a few certifications and learn some stuff on my own, and then if I even find a job, coming in the first day and not having a clue what I'm doing.

SammaSunshine,stepparents,1389467146.0,"I have been in similar shoes, I was 20, my boyfriend was 28 with two kids, and we loved eachother. 4 years later, we are no longer together, though have friendship and I still get to see and love his kids. One of the reasons we ended things is because I was young, and he didn't want me to wake up at age 30 thinking I wasted my 20's. 

You are 21. You already said you've grown up too fast, getting into relationships with men that have children just makes you have to grow up faster. 

You are too young to be sorting this mess out for him, taking care of his kids with no authority to discipline them as your own. You can love him, and them, as much as humanly possible but it won't be enough until your fiance acknowledges how hard you work for those kids, and that you not only deserve some time for yourself but also some respect from him and his exwife. If you continue to do the damn good job that you are proud of, you will continue to be nothing but a live in babysitter. It happened in your last relationship, do you not see it happening in this one?

At 21 you are entitled to make descisions about your life. Have you ever thought about what would make you happy? College, or a career, international travel? I wanted those things but was very ready to not do them in order to marry my ex and settle down. He knew I would never do what I wanted with my life if we got married, and he was right. We've been broken up since October, and rather than be home taking care of the kids, I'm currently in Europe and making plans to travel to Asia. I still love his kids, and we didn't have all the same issues that your relationship does, but I get to live my life and enjoy my 20's, explore the world before I choose to settle down. You don't have to grow up too fast if you don't want to. You will still be a great person if you decide to pursue your interests and do what you want with your life instead of settling down. 



I also must ask you to consider what your life will be like in the future when you want to have more children with this man. Will he support you then? Give you a break when you need it, discipline the kids when they need it? Or will it all fall on you then? I am not telling you you need to dump him, you guys could pursue counseling and do your best to make it work.  Like I said, you are an adult who can decide her own life. All I'm saying is consider what you want your life to be and how it compares to your life right now. If this is the path you want to take, talk to your fiance about his disrespect for you, your time, and your effort. Things won't change until you present a united front to the kids and his ex. Good Luck!"

Certainly first would be better, but inability to stop the run is not the primary reason why we lost games this year.  I think we have higher priorities.

I particularly don't see the argument for drafting a NT.  We had the 4th-ranked run defense *despite* being without our starting NT all year.  Our DLine play will likely improve just by having Ian Williams back, and Ray McDonald playing without an injured bicep.

Yes, Louis Nix might be an upgrade, but is he enough of an upgrade to justify spending a first-round pick, as opposed to upgrading our receiving corps, or replacing all the CBs we're losing?  Probably not.  And anyone we draft in the 3rd or 4th round is unlikely to play very much due to the amount of depth and talent we already have.  I think its very unlikely that we'll upgrade our DLine through the draft this year.

Fundamentally: I feel like DLine, along with LB and RB, is one of the positions we have the least need for right now.  Not that we won't take a talented prospect if he drops to us - best player available is always a good strategy - but I improving our already very good and already very deep DLine just doesn't feel like a priority relative to our other needs."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389467364.0,"&gt;FGM and circumcision aren't the same thing.

Actually, they really are kind of.  Both involve altering the genitals of children against their will and without their consent.  But there are some differences.

Worldwide, the practice of male circumcision leaves more boys with permanently damaged genitals than FGM does.  Less than .1% of circumcisions result in permanent, debilitating damage -- but so many are performed every year that the .1% that are botched equals *twice* the total number of FGMs per year (12,000 vs 6,000).  So obviously the *scale* of the problem is quite different.

Second, every culture that practices FGM at the time of puberty *also* practices [male genital mutilation](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/07/30-south-african-men-killed-in-ritual-circumcision/) around the same age.

So when we talk about male circumcision vs female genital mutilation, what we are really talking about is a set of ritual mutilations done to both genders or one gender.  When these practices are performed at the onset of adulthood, they are done to both genders.  When these practices are performed at birth, they are only done to men.

So basically we have cultures that mutilate the genitals of boys and girls at puberty, cultures that mutilate the genitals of boys at birth but never girls, and cultures that do neither.

Why can't we be a culture that does neither? "

2. It robs the fire of the heat energy it needs to keep burning by vaporizing, creating steam.

In case you care, the owner of this car and his friend that helped him set it up this way are very active on the forums answering questions on wheel fitment of all varieties; from aggressive stance to aggressive track fitments. They have experience with all kinds of wheel/tire/suspension set ups through trial and error, so they know what wheel sizes, offsets, tire sizes, etc fit with different suspension set ups with certain amounts of suspension tweaks and fender work. So please tell me more about how some knowledgeable people who help the rest of the car community are ruining the car community?

On second though, please don't because I know you're going to spout the same bullshit you always do about how stance ruins ""rally"" cars (because everyone who buys a Subaru automatically wants to rally it) and it's not performance oriented. Because everyone knows that they only way someone should modify their car is to make it go/stop faster or handle better, not to make it (what they feel is) aesthetically pleasing. Then you're going to talk about how it's dangerous because a stretched tire *could* unseat while driving down the road in spite of the fact that there is almost no evidence of this ever happening.

Here's the thing. Treating property rights as inviolable and banking the entire sustenance of the vast majority of the populace on a few rich peoples' charity and self interested job creation doesn't cut it. It's inefficient, because many people get left out, and those who get stuff often get exploited. You need social safety nets paid out of peoples' taxes to make sure EVERYONE gets a decent standard of living. Now, as stated in my own post, I'm not proposing communism. I dont propose taking all the wealth, socializing the entire economy, and distributing it equally, that's disastrous.

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1389467530.0,"Sorry, no, that's not going to give you an accurate idea of passing in the future. Having ""good"" measurements means you may have a nice body.

Passing for trans women is mostly about the face. Hair, eyebrows, and makeup are the things that are easier. Facial structure will probably change a lot with a year or two of HRT, but some people are still going to have features that make passing more difficult, like a very strong jaw, a masculine nose, or a ""cave man"" brow, things that may need surgery. The presence of facial hair is a big thing that makes passing difficult. 

Clothes probably help more than body shape. Voice is pretty important.

I know a 300lb plus trans woman who passes 100%. She's not particularly feminine in appearance, doesn't wear makeup, and she doesn't have the body of a model, but HRT has done a lot to her face, she doesn't have visible shadow, and her voice is great."

I don't have much time or patience for console gaming anymore, and I love just pulling out a handheld when I have moments of free time or I don't have much else to do. Though, despite having a 3DS, I'll still play DS games like Advance Wars and Tetris DS (probably the best tetris ever made).

I skip onto Dark Souls now and then, though, and do still play as often as possible. I've been playing that for a long time, and was pleasantly surprised to see the Souls' series pick up traction over the last six months or so.

Favorite games:

- Dark Souls
- Advance Wars: Days of Ruin
- Pokemon Sapphire (I keep up with Pokemon, but this was just the best)
- LOZ: Majora's Mask

Sherman was a ""cool guy"" and talked to a lot of people but was getting a little weary if over a hundres ppl asking for pictures but did so with a smile in his face. Said Kam was tall dark and handsome. Truf was cool--a good host. She wasn't too descriptive. It was a halloween party and Sherman was wearing a penguin costume. Tate was a cowboy.

Another friend used to know mlb closer, JJ Putz, and would watch his house when he was on the road. Said he was the nicest guy ever and would go to neigjbirhood bqqs etc.

dakboy,personalfinance,1389468068.0,"&gt; Also remember that after buying a house, you will likely spend a lot of money to get the house to how you want it (blinds, lights, paint, shelving....)

Do these things **before** you move in. It's a hell of a lot easier to paint, put up lights &amp; blinds, etc. in an empty room vs. working around furniture.

If you're building, ask the builder about painting custom colors when their painters come through. It'll add about $150/room (not much different from having a contractor come in later to do it) and they'll be doing everything before carpets &amp; other finish work is in, so there's no worries about dripping paint on the carpet and finished flooring. If compare the prices of the light fixtures at Lowe's or online (like http://www.lightingdirect.com/) to the ones at the place your builder sends you - you'll probably find a major savings there, and they'll let you do it as long as you deliver the fixtures to the premises on by a particular date for installation (if you do this, **make sure** you take an inventory of the fixtures &amp; verify that they're all installed before signing off on the final walk-through. Sometimes fixtures can ""disappear"").

If you're moving into an existing house, do those things while you're still in your previous home."

dxdrummer,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1389468231.0,"I really like Zilean, and I used to play him with the 1000 AP build....here's some things I've noticed

1) He doesn't have hard CC. You can speed people up and slow them down, but you can't stun anyone. This makes him poor for peeling (and with all of the assassins in the league now, having a good peeler is almost mandatory)

2) His bombs do a TON of damage, but he has to be close range to use them, and he's not very beefy on his own. If you build AP, you don't have much survivability. If you build for survivability, then Zilean is basically useless because both your bombs and your ult will be super weak. If you decided to use your ult on yourself after bombing them, then you're basically useless for 6 seconds until your bombs come up again.

3) His ult can be powerful, but it's hard to use well. Either you use it on someone who's about to die (which means they'll come back to full health but they'll be in the middle of their team), you use it on yourself (which means you don't give it to a actual carry or tank), or you use it on someone who doesn't really need it then, and potentially end up wasting it.

4) He pushes the lane HARD unintentionally. If you're playing against smart players and you place a bomb on them, they'll run into their creep wave in order to force you to push. This could lead to a ton of ganks against your bot lane, and if you're not warding properly you can fall behind very fast.

So basically I think he's fun but there are other supports which provide a lot more beefiness (always useful to have more 'protectors' on your team) and utility (thresh and nautilus especially). I don't think he's necessarily a bad champion, but he wouldn't make a great choice because you'd be choosing him over a much better support"

It's not the people who are just pointing out that it didn't work for them that bother me. That's fine.

As for the ""tease"" thing, you've got your fellow women to blame for putting you in that position.  Unfortunately, a lot of women who *are* interested in having sex don't want to seem overly eager.

I was so upset because no one else knew and I loved my cat but I didn't know how to tell everyone what I had done and that I couldn't figure out how to change her back and I wanted everyone to love my cat-baby as much as I did and not blame her for my mistake. 

Also odd, my baby is always a girl in my dreams...foretelling???"

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1389468655.0,"There is no problem so bad that drinking can't make it worse.

I have been a manager and a teacher. I can tell you from that point of view that employees and students who proactively and respectfully communicate their problems get a lot more slack. Meaning, make sure you let them know what's going on in your life, why these problems occurred, and why they can be assured they won't keep occurring. It gives you a much better chance of holding on to your job. If you can talk to your manager about it before the meeting, do so. If you can't, then respectfully ask to explain during the meeting, if it is bad news.

I'd also like to point out that you don't know for sure there is a problem. It could be something else entirely. 

However, if the worst happens and you lose your job, so be it. You can look for another job, you can adjust your budget for that ring. (FWIW, if she is demanding an expensive ring, I would think twice about marrying her.) It isn't the end of the world. 

All that drinking would do is make problems you have worse, and make new problems.

Tarnsman4Life,BDSMcommunity,1389468912.0,"One of my (no longer)long time friends in the community was a Domme who is in her 60's. She has been involved in the lifestyle almost twice as long as I have been alive. She had a masters in psychology and she couldn't figure me out. She ended up one day coming to the serious conclusion I would ""end up a serial killer"" and I was into BDSM because I ""hated women""...yeah that was the end of that friendship!


Looking back at my own life I can only explain a tiny bit of why I am a Master. My parents did a shit job or raising me, they really were not parents at all beyond putting a roof over my head and microwaving me chicken nuggits sometimes. This forced me from a very early age to learn to take charge. I taught myself to brush my own teeth, tie my own shoes, button my own shirts and pants. My first ""relationship"" at almost 16 was a BDSM relationship with an older more ""Topish' woman. It didn't last long, i didn't like it beyond the sex and from that point on I decided I would always be the one in control. I enjoy what I am at every level but can't really explain much at all of why I like this or that.


Edit: Thinking about it more; I would say I fancy redheads. I wouldn't call it a fetish but it could be because one of my longest running Childhood friends was a redheaded girl named Jennifer. It could be because the first porno I watched had a redhead in it, who the heck knows

-Tommy,Naruto,1389468923.0,"Okay you are clearly confused so I am going to explain this as easy as possible. Sage and Fusion are not the same thing, you are correct, but Naruto does not need the fusion. Jiriaya only needed it since on his own he could not get the chakra, maintain it, and move in battle. Naruto already learned how to gather the chakra almost instantly and then move with it. So Jiriaya would fuse with the toads who would do it and then pass the chakra onto him. The reason he changed appearance is because he could not handle the chakra as well as Naruto can. Naruto changes slightly also in his eyes. Otherwise the fusion is just how Jiriaya uses his sage mode, they meet the same means. Naruto can probably do the fusion since Kurama isn't there to kick them out, but he has no need to danger them since his sage mode is nearly perfect on his own. It would be a waste of time to summon them now. 

So, yes he can fuse now. No, he won't fuse. Yes, sage mode and fusion are different but fusion leads to sage mode and is used because it is easier. Understand everything now? I tried to address all  your issues in this thread with one comment instead of being like everyone else and downvoting."

I've never had to pay so much attention to my own body language before. Even making eye contact can reinforce bad behavior! For example, our dog was barking every night at 3am, wanting to be let out (he didn't need to pee, he just wanted our attention). Telling him to be quiet, looking at him, or even turning over in bed let him know he was getting our attention. So we had to completely ignore his barking. I originally thought that saying ""no!"" will teach the dog to stop barking. Nope, it teaches the dog that barking = attention. 

After a few nights of us ignoring his barking, it stopped! Ah, restful nights once again. :-) "

balathustrius,mead,1389468983.0,"I would do it this way:

* Put just the honey and tap-temperature water into the jug at first. Fill the jug only to around 3/4ths (to leave room for more ingredients). Cap that and shake it until the water and honey is well-mixed.

* Add other ingredients.

* Top the jug up to nearly 1 gallon with water if necessary. Leave room for about 100ml more liquid that will come with the yeast pitch.

* Take a hydrometer reading. I hope you got a hydrometer test tube. See [this YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTvmYaQq6Mc) for how to use a hydrometer. As a note, the scale you'll want to use is specific gravity (SG) or Brix. I prefer SG. Make sure all of that equipment is sanitized as well.

* Microwave (in a sanitized container) 100ml of water until 104F-109F (40C-43C). My microwave takes 25 seconds. Pitch the yeast onto this and wait 10 minutes. Stir it in (with a sanitized utensil) and wait another ten minutes. Pitch onto the must and give it another shake-up.

* Airlock it, place somewhere dark with a steady temperature. Monitor the airlock, fermentation may be vigorous and cause the airlock to blow off.

When you post a temperature in this or any homebrewing sub, it helps if you say whether it's F or C. This time, considering 40C is 104F, it's easy to figure out."

I can't give you device any better than /u/duckgoesquackmoo, cause he really nailed it. You made the right call. You need this poison out of your life.

Like you I was a late bloomer to dating. I was 23 when I had my first girlfriend show up. And she was incredible. She was smoking hot, and seemingly very sweet and damn did we fall for each other quickly. It was blissful. And for the first time I felt super comfortable and super confident in someone else n my life. 

Her and I had to break up because of some shitty things she did (namely cheating on me). I pseudo took her back, but never officially. 

Meeting new women, I hate it. I dont find anyone as attractive as my ex. A few girls I have, I can't stop comoaring . And even if I found one, it seems so daunting to try and build something as incredible as I had with my ex.

From what I hear on /r/relationships though, it will happen again, and we will both look back on these fundamentally bad relationships and know that we learned from it. You and I are both catches beyond what these girls deserve.

I just finally went no contact with my ex last night after being weak and seeing her. I told her I couldn't see her anymore because all I could think of was how good things used o be, and I am starting to resent her for ruining it. 

Together, let's stop being doormats, and start ACTING like the guys we both know we are: better than this shit.

Phantom_Scarecrow,AskReddit,1389469002.0,"I used to drive a school bus, and I worked in the garage between runs. Over the summer I helped ready the buses for their annual State inspection. 5 Police Officers would come to the garage to inspect the buses, and they were BRUTAL. They'd fail a bus for the smallest issue, like stray blobs of grease on the tie rod fittings. 

We had just finished our inspection and the last bus was sitting in the garage. I needed to move it back outside, so I got in, checked the mirrors, backed it up about 8 feet, and... *CRUNCH*. 

I had backed into the Corporal's unmarked patrol car. He had just pulled in as I approached the bus from the front. I couldn't see the car in the side mirrors, and the overhead mirror was tilted up, so I didn't see the car in it, either. I rolled the rood, broke the grille, and pushed the headlights in.

Consequences- the guys in the other shops got a laugh out of it. We sent the car to our company body shop, because it was an older Caprice, and our Access program still used them, so the shop had a spare hood and grille. I wasn't even written up.

 The next day, two of the mechanics from another shop came by to pick up a tool we'd borrowed. One saw my name and said, ""Hey, you're the one that ran over the Corporal's Car!""

dxdrummer,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1389469146.0,"Former Blitz main here (~400 games with him)

Blitz can deal some pretty hefty damage with AP, but it's kind of a unique/novelty choice (unless you're in ARAM). Your grab and ult both have humongous AP ratios, and if you had a lich bane, you could do a ton of damage with your E as well. You could try different options to provide a little AP to your kit to up your damage, but he's generally better off tanky with utility

I generally start him off with the Ancient Coin in order to get more money for him and to provide at least a little regen for his Q. Targon's was considered strong, but requires you to run up in melee range to the minions which could lead you to taking a lot of damage (especially considering that he's really not that tanky early game).

After ancient coin, I try to build like a pure CDR tank. Depending on your lane matchup, you can go with a Chalice, or you can buy some pots and wait it out. You may be tempted to do manamune, but it's really not a good option on him. You won't use your abilites enough to cap it and you won't attack enough in teamfights to add that much mana, so the item would end up just being a waste. However, Iceborn Gauntlet is amazing on him. You get CDR, an AD buff to your E, and a slowing AOE once you hit someone with it. It also provides mana for your shield while giving you a hefty amount of armor as well.

Randuin's is also a good item on him since it provides health (and considering that you're supporting you won't really be getting much money anyway), and I like Spirit Visage on him as well because of the health and the CDR (the healing is somewhat wasted on him but the rest of the stats generally make up for it...you could also go banshee's veil here depending on the matchup).

In regards to boots, I almost always get Merc Treads on him. The CC boots may be tempting, but you'll be sacrificing survivability for a little more CDR that you'll be getting from other items anyway. Also, once Blitz pulls, you'll need to be able to take damage because if you don't 100-&gt;0 their champion their team will engage on you hard.




So, in list form, my favorite items:

1) Iceborn Gauntlet (or Randuins depending)
2) Spirit Visage (or Banshee's, depending)
3) Talisman of Ascension
4) Aegis/Locket (if your jungler isn't getting it)
5) Merc Treads
6) Ruby Sightstone (This one is more personal preference but i like getting it on him ~65% of the time)

And, for fun, my AP build:

1) Rod of Ages
2) Zhonya's Hourglass
3) Lich Bane
4) Sorc Boots/Merc Treads
5) Abyssal Scepter
6) Athene's Unholy Grail/Deathfire Grasp/Rabadon's Deathcap


I've also tried AD builds, but I really don't like them on him so I don't have a build for that"

GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,panthers,1389469203.0,"For starters, Kuechly is not universally recognized as the best ILB in the league, although I'm sure you'd like to think that. In fact, [Pro Football Focus didn't even put him on the first or second all-pro team](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2014/01/06/2013-pff-all-pro-team/2/). Harbaugh saying it's hard to stop Kuechly means absolutely nothing. In the past he has said the same thing about DeMarcus Ware, Sean Lee, Ndamukong Suh, London Fletcher, Ray Lewis, Terrell Suggs, Haloti Ngata, Chris Long, Lawrence Timmons, Jonathan Vilma, Sean Weatherspoon, Clay Matthews, Kyle Williams, Richard Sherman, Brandon Browner, Earl Thomas, Bruce Irvin, Patrick Peterson, Brian Urlacher, Brent Grimes, Kenny Vaccaro, JJ Watt, Paul Posluszny, Lavonte David, and of course, Saint Keuchly. Pretty mch every defensive standout on any team he's played.  
That being said, the overall perception on this subreddit is that everyone who disagrees with Our Lord and Savior Kuechly is a hater who doesn't recognize His greatness. I have watched about 20 Panthers games starring Luke Kuechly and from what I draw out from that he is undoubtedly a fantastic football player. But He is nowhere near the level of NaVorro Bowman or Patrick Willis. Kuechly is a physically gifted player, but he just isn't on the level of our two linebackers, although i understand your fanbase, one that hasn't seen a defensive standout since Julius Peppers, desperately wishes it was so. He may surpass them one day. But gaudy tackles numbers can't hide that he just isn't as good of a football player.  
I do like the Panthers. I really do. I hope, should we lose, that you guys crush either Seattle or the Aints. I'm not a hater. But I am a doubter."

If you cerakoted a knife like a Zero Tolerance, BUSSE, KaBar, TOPS, or any other sort of modern tactical fixed blade, I don't think the value would diminish much at all.

goundo,climbing,1389469419.0,"I noticed that, while he said ""fast food"", only McDonald's was mentioned by name. It was also the only fast food restaurant shown in the video (even managed to get a clear shot of the sign in there), and was the only food that was shown in the video.

At one point in the video, he says he was a heavy consumer of fast food all his life. Later he says ""I eat McDonalds pretty much every day, and I am much healthier for it.""

To me, it looks like McDonalds trying to expand their market. This video would appeal to people who want to be healthy, but want to eat at McDonald's. The video even supplies them with excuses: ""this one guy eats McD's, and he has a 6 pack"", or ""I just don't have enough time.""

Maybe this guy really likes McDonald's for some reason I cannot fathom, but I would say it is a 50/50 shot that he got some corporate money to make this video."

This song should be suitable for a chorus and I think the lyrics will be about the responsibility of having a baby.

Any feedback gratefully received, especially how to make the chorus more interesting. I'm thinking maybe electric guitars but I don't know how to write for them.

sinbysilence,AskReddit,1389469438.0,"Man, I came here to post my story, but it's kind of similar to yours.

I owned a '87 Pontiac Fiero. Was on my way to work one day when the accelerator stuck. Since I wasn't able to slow down and turn (I wad going about 70mph at the time) I was forced to go down a very curvy hill. One side of the hill was obviously rock,  the other side was a HUGE drop off. By this point the needle on my speedometer was bouncing on the 85 (the top speed it registered). I'm taking up all three lanes trying to not hit the rock or go off the edge of the cliff.
In the meantime, I have one foot standing on the break, the other foot underneath the gas pedal trying to pull it up.
I know that at the bottom of this hill is main street, where the speed limit is 35. The whole time I'm thinking I'm either going to die or kill people. Or both.
I end up digging my phone out of my pocket to call my then boyfriend to see what the hell I should do. As soon as he answered,  the accelerator released itself and I began to slow.
As soon as I could,  I pulled the car over, got out,  got sick, and cried."

wufoo2,AskMen,1389469497.0,"I'm guessing you want some sort of scientific answer. I don't think you'll find it, because human perception is slippery.

A man who volunteers to get circumcised probably wants it anyway, and he's likely to have a kind of [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice-supportive_bias) about what it's done to him. In other words, he's likely to claim everything is the same or better, because he can't change his mind now.

I think the best answer comes from using your own reasoning and perceptive powers. For example, if you didn't have lips, would kissing be as pleasurable as if you did? You wouldn't have all the nerve endings that sense stretch-and-release, and your tongue would be dry all the time.

Circumcision removes 1/3 of the nerve endings from the penis, and half the skin. It forces the glans - an internal organ - to adapt into an external organ, causing [keratinization](http://stopthecut.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/12336060979711.jpg) (NSFW).

There's no doubt the circumcised penis is less capable of the sensory perception it was designed with.

How could that possibly be an improvement?

EDIT: Missed your question about adult vs. infant circumcision. With infants we do know that circumcision [negatively affects breast feeding](http://www.cirp.org/library/birth/leaven1/). There's also hints that [it affects hip flexibility later in a boy's development](http://www.drmomma.org/2009/06/avoiding-cobra-pose.html). So there's a good start on answering that half of the question.

With adults, there's a cognitive recognition of what the pain means, and the ability to make sense of it. There are also pain medications given to every adult after surgery.

Infants don't have either. And they get a diaper full of hot urine repeatedly applied to the wound."

I'm arguing that even if that was the case (which it most likely is) I doubt that something horrible is going to come out of it, therefore they're over reacting. As far as we know, the wizarding world runs really different from the muggle world. Even if muggle law is vastly more complex than Harry could imagine, that still doesn't tell us much about wizarding law. You can't say, muggle law is super hard to understand therefore wizarding law is hard too.

flyingcatpotato,childfree,1389469870.0,"I am almost 40 years old and have been working since i was 15. What i have noticed is that companies either have ""family-friendly"" policies or they don't.  It is a management culture thing.  Ive told the story many times on this sub about how i burnt out covering repetitive maternity leaves. It wasn't the women's fault for getting pregnant, it was management's fault for not finding appropriate cover, it was management's fault for allowing parents to call in at the drop of a hat while being stricter on people without kids, it was management's fault for playing favorites.  

These types of issues only get better with a change of management or a change of job.  If you have been carrying the can for parents, if you are doing a good job then they have no motivation for the parents to actually do theirs. I wish i could tell you something better, but it took me until a few years ago to actually have a job where parents showed up on time and worked. My boss is so kind to me and generous with both my hours and my time off that i volunteer to travel so that he does not have to be away from his family.  The thing is, he understands that he had to give to get, and when my turn comes he has no problem giving me the time i need. I had a job like yours once, where parents could call in for anything, but if i was five minutes late i got written up, where i wasn't reimbursed fairly for travel yet i was the only one traveling because no family...it just sucked and it only got better changing jobs and working for normal people who have teams who work for results instead of charity case parents who show up at work to socialize and think sending an email is a big deal."

&gt;What is Holistic Medicine?

&gt;Holistic medicine is the art and science of healing that addresses care of the whole person - body, mind, and spirit. The practice of holistic medicine integrates conventional and complementary therapies to promote optimal health, and prevent and treat disease by addressing contributing factors. Holistic healthcare practitioners strive to meet the patient with grace, kindness, acceptance, and spirit without condition, as love is life’s most powerful healer.

&gt;In practice, this means that each person is seen as a unique individual, rather than an example of a particular disease. Disease is understood to be the result of physical, emotional, spiritual, social and environmental imbalance. Healing, therefore, takes place naturally when these aspects of life are brought into proper balance. The role of the practitioner is as guide, mentor and role model; the patient must do the work - changing lifestyle, beliefs and old habits in order to facilitate healing. All appropriate methods may be used, from medication to meditation.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389470351.0,"&gt; It'll be more of a case by case basis. 

So you think men are individuals whose preferences should be weighed on a case-by-case basis, but women have blanket desires?  That's bullshit, my friend.  That's like how tall men are evaluated on an individual basis, while short men are treated as belonging to a group and the actions of one short men are regarded as reflecting on us all.  It's a bullshit double-standard.

&gt;I guess you can say weight, but again you don't have men going around with weight cutoffs.

That's because it's not socially acceptable.  This proves my point that much of this is about a social construct.  Our social values control the dating market.  Not ""innate"" attractions which apply to an entire gender.  Remember, the question was about the ""psyche"" of men as an entire gender.  Not about whether they are allowed to express cutoffs.  

&gt;But if I had to pick a preference that men have for women that is ingrained in their psyches then it would have to be height.

Huuu?  It's ingrained in our male psyche that we have a preference for shorter women?  A LOT of men (especially shorter guys) would be very surprised to learn that.  

&gt;Women do fall victim to social cues and norms, but isn't it interesting that the rise of these height requirements coincides with the female sexual liberation movement?

And isn't it interesting that the rise of Global Average Temperature  coincides with a decline in the number of [Pirates in the World](http://www.venganza.org/images/PiratesVsTemp.png)?

&gt;Maybe females have repressed these desires all along but now that they are sexually liberated they are voicing their real preferences. I'm not saying that this is right, but I'm starting to lean towards this view.

Isn't it more likely to think that these views are being voiced as heightism becomes worse and more accepted in our society?  Isn't it just as likely that a society which fosters heightism is also a society which encourages women to disregard short men?

Otherwise, shouldn't we see the same level of height requirements in other countries in which women are liberated?  But we don't.  Just look at France, for instance.  Height requirements (anecdotally) are much less prevalent there than in the United States.  But women are just as liberated.  Did French women not get the height requirement gene?"

For example, I disagreed with my college's LGBT club attempting to shut down the blood drive on campus even though the FDA is discriminating against men who have sex with men. It felt counterintuitive because the organization running the blood drive had absolutely no say in the restriction. I donated blood anyway because it was a good cause (and I'm a virgin).

I don't let their stance and actions define me. That is how I see it. Any organization of people will have divisions on certain issues with the group. It is necessary to be aware of these differences and to not out individual stances limit those in the group. If we are particular with our stances within a movement, we eventually won't have enough support to change anything."

No, maybe they don't consciously think that, but media is beating these misogynist ideas into childrens' heads all of the time. Unless they actively work to deconstruct those ideas, [it's fairly unlikely that they'd never absorb just a little fraction of it](http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/01/showbiz/tv/tv-kids-self-esteem). White straight men are uniquely vulnerable to this because they're often the [target demographic for the majority of what's produced by mainstream media](http://stfu-moffat.tumblr.com/post/71115155206/new-york-film-academys-study-of-gender-inequality) and [thousands of years of misogyny is bound to leave a trace or two](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yashar-hedayat/a-message-to-women-from-a_1_b_958859.html), that is all there is to it.

I have a story for you it sounds like you might relate to. When I was in middle school, I was trying to find myself. She never bought me clothes so I had old, too small clothes, or my step sisters hand me downs (for context, step sister from my dad remarrying). I tried to restyle my clothes to look fashionable. Unfortunately, this was when puberty decided to give me a few extra pounds. But I was only a little chubby at most. 

I'd come downstairs and ask her for her opinion (since I had no other friends or family close by) and every time without fail she'd say, ""well... if you lost a few pounds."" At 12, that shit is damaging. So of course it'd get to me and I'd go to my room and cry. A few minutes later she'd come up and ask me why I was crying like nothing had happened. I'd tell her it was because of what she said and she'd deny and say she'd *never* say that. Rinse and repeat.

She also glorified a photo on the fridge of her in a bathing suit from when she had an eating disorder. In that photo, she was 25lbs less than my weight at the time."

I understand that most people probably can't afford to just buy them all, and nor can I - I got a Wii first, buying it from a friend, then got a 360 new using my staff discount when I worked in a game shop, then finally got a PS3 just now.  That's over the course of what, about seven years?  That makes it affordable.  So I prioritised based on what I wanted to play most.  Twilight Princess, then the various Halos, and now The Last of Us.  Now I have everything, just as a new generation comes out.  But since I waited six years to get a 360 and the entire ""current gen"" lifespan of the PS3 to get one of those, I think I can safely wait for the new gen.  There's really only one game I'm interested in that's exclusive to the new generation anyway so far, and that's Killzone.

For that reason, he wanted to get past the case around Draco and Hermione, get Draco back into the story, and proceed with whatever is going to come.

I mean it's getting better.  I guess.  But even a few nights ago I was talking with my roommate how most famous women of color aren't ""field negros"", they're still the kind that got let in the big house.  They're light skinned, have [""good hair""](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=good%20hair), thin bodies and traditionally European features.  Your Beyonces, your Zoe Saldanas and Hallie Berry's far outnumber your Angela Bassetts. It's just upsetting to me. I grew up surrounded by strong older women of color.  Teachers and neighbors.  I just wish I saw more women like them.  

I'm not even ashamed to say that bias is part of the reason I loved Orange is the New Black so much.  God what an amazing show just in terms of representation.  There is an honest to god fucking transsexual woman in it!  And she's awesome and well rounded and everything.  There were over weight Latinas and older Caribbean women and short haired stocky lesbians and nappy headed dark skinned honest to god women like the kind I've known all my life.

professor__doom,changemyview,1389471233.0,"Their own civilization would be able to counter the individual's instrument of destruction, but ours would be insufficiently advanced.

An individual terrorist with a [""technical"" truck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_%28vehicle%29) could be contained and rendered harmless by your average city police department today, and the resources of the FBI or military would even be overkill against such a threat.  There would be casualties when he initially opened fire.  But once he has given away his position, he would no longer be a threat--civilians would be able to get away, and police snipers, possibly using helicopters, would make short work of him.  Less than 300 years ago, such an individual, if he selected a geographically advantageous position, could slaughter hundreds or even thousands, using his vehicle to give chase when his targets fled.  The short-ranged, inaccurate firearms of the period would be hopeless against his machine gun, and he'd be able to either mow down or outrun a ""human wave"" attack.

To take things to the ""potential for extinction"" level, imagine the havoc that a modern-day individual with knowledge of biological warfare could wreak in, say, the 1500s with a fully fueled long range airplane and some cultivated lab samples.  Today, we have many means of dealing with this: drugs, epidemiology and the infrastructure to halt the spread of the disease, scientific understanding of the nature of pathogens, and of course the ability to take down his plane.

But civilization in the 1500s wouldn't even understand what was killing them, let alone have any idea how to save themselves from it.

Extrapolate this sort of technological asymmetry to what a civilization thousands of years more advanced than our own may possess--it's entirely possible for one screwed-up individual using equipment that his own civilization would consider ""commonplace"" to wipe out the human race."

This is special pleading. By this logic they could believe that a god very much like zeus, but with a different outfit exists, while still being atheist. As long as no one explicitly defined said god in totality. As much as people don't like to admit it, the truth is that people rarely call themselves atheists unless they are pretty sure. There would be no reason to call themself an atheist if they thought gods did exist which just haven't been defined properly yet. So while it may technically be kind of true in a way, it's still misleading for them to try to hijack the agnostic label.

ejchristian86,aww,1389471479.0,"Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a polar bear psychologist (though if anyone develops a training program for that, sign me up because that sounds awesome). Instead, keepers and vet staff have to rely on behavioral cues from the animal that would signal depression - many of which are the same type of cues that would signal depression in humans. Is the animal playful? Does she seek out browse (snacks placed throughout her enclosure) and enrichment (toys, usually with a food/treat incentive hidden inside that takes some effort to get to) within her enclosure, or does she ignore them? Is she eating a healthy amount? If she is in a multi-animal enclosure (and most of the animals are), what are her interactions like with the other animals? Is she overly aggressive outside of a natural dominance structure, or overly fearful of other animals? What is her behavior like with her keepers (again, aggressive and fearful are the warning signs)? Does she engage in harmful behaviors, such as chewing on herself or chewing/rubbing parts of her habitat to the point of injuring herself? How does she respond to training efforts? How does she respond to the public?

They don't just stick a bear in a cage and wash their hands of her. These animals are constantly being assessed and reassessed as to their overall happiness and well-being. You don't become a zookeeper or a zoo vet unless you really love the animals you care for, and the people who work there really do want the animals to be happy."

If I had to to sit down, and try to come up with a design for a folding knife that people liked, I imagine it'd take me years.  Then you have to try to make the knife while keeping the design intact and making sure it functions properly.  You must be able to be able to have an incredibly steady hand for grinding the blade and whatever else you need to do, and if you fuck it up, you must scrap the material and start again.  I think that there are a lot of factors that come into play (blade geometry, grind, tolerances, ergonomics, weight, thickness, length, aesthetic designs, pocket clip) when making a knife that would take me years to come up with something that worked well and that people liked.  I could never justify spending over $1k on a knife, but I understand why they go for that much.

Basically the two applicators give different effects, the sponge side is good for adding soot, snow, rust on bolts, etc., it applies to all surfaces pretty well, and makes it stick better.

The brush side is more for a dust effect, and also you can highlight panel lines quite easily by brushing over them, or angled edges in the turret etc., if you want to make them pop more.  

I searched for some YouTube tutorials before I tried it, and it is extremely easy to use.  

I used Rust on the tracks, along with Mud, with the sponge applicator.  This took a toll on my sponge as I ripped it applying too much pressure (or it caught on one of the corners of the tank treads too much), and once they were weathered the tracks looked a lot better than they did as black vinyl.  Once I finished weathering the tracks I melted them together with a screwdriver, and put them on the tank...  

The first thing I weathered was the wheels, since they had the smallest surface area and I figured it would be the best piece to practice on. 

Then I rusted up the hull a bit around the hinges / bolts, added soot, a few colors of dirt, a little bit of mud around the cupola on the top (I figured if the Tank Commander was climbing into the tank with mud on his boots he might get some on the turret etc.) and then added snow over everything.

Once your done weathering you will want to apply a lacquer coat, I used Testors Dull coat.  This will seal off any weathering pigments and prevent them from being rubbed off, you can also wait about 20 minutes for the Dull coat to dry and weather it some more if you feel it needs more weathering.  The dull coat makes the weathering effects a bit more subtle than when first applied, so you can be the judge on whether or not to give it more weathering.  

For decals you will need a gloss coat, I used Testors Clearcoat.  This makes the area you are applying decals nice and smooth, as the matte paints have a rough microscopic finish. 

The gloss coat takes about 24 hours to dry, it's enamel, and seems to have a thicker consistency than the dull coat."

robinhoode,BitcoinSerious,1389471651.0,"&gt; You should do these things in code, just like Satoshi complemented his paper with code.

Bitcoin had a history of discussion before code was released:

http://p2pfoundation.net/Bitcoin#Prehistory:_the_dream_of_anonymous_digital_currencies

&gt; The pursuit of an independent digital currency really got started in 1992, when Timothy May, a retired Intel physicist, invited a group of friends over to his house outside Santa Cruz, Calif., to discuss privacy and the nascent Internet. In the prior decade, cryptographic tools, like Whitfield Diffie’s public-key encryption and Phil Zimmermann’s Pretty Good Privacy, had proven useful for controlling who could access digital messages. Fearing a sudden shift in power and information control, governments around the world had begun threatening to restrict access to such cryptographic protocols.  

It didn't come out of thin air. People discuss things. Some of the ideas were half-baked, to the point that there were just suggestions about what could be, not on how to make it happen.

It took 6 years of discussion before anyone even worked on anything technical:

&gt; While cypherpunks like Bell were dreaming up potential uses for digital currencies, others were more focused on working out the technical problems. Wei Dai had just graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in computer science when he created b-money in 1998. “My motivation for b-money was to enable online economies that are purely voluntary,” says Dai, “ones that couldn’t be taxed or regulated through the threat of force.” But b-money was a purely personal project, more conceptual than practical.  

Technology is not brought down by the gods. Possibilities are discussed before people build things. If /r/BitcoinSerious isn't the place to discuss this, please inform me where that should be.

&gt; I haven't seen you do any of the above. So how can I tell you what specific flaws your plan has?

The point of the discussion was to figure that out. I thought I made that clear from my OP."

Every aspiring nurse has to get his/her basic RN license before continuing on to get certs for specialties. You can get your RN with either an ADN or a BSN. Don't even worry about your MSN right now.

You can talk to a NICU nurse if you want to find out about the  certs, extra training, and years/type of nursing experience required in order to start working in NICU. However, as I said before, talk to the advisor of your school's nursing department. You first need to focus on applying to and graduating nursing school."

jjmoreta,utdallas,1389471737.0,"My chain of investigation for obtaining the best deals on textbooks. Listed loosely in order of easy and ethical/legal.
 
1. Do you truly need the new ed of the text (especially if this the first semester its being used)? 
 
Most of my UTD profs haven't cared and will let you use the older one. It's always worth asking about because the older edition prices drop drastically once the new one comes out and changes to the overall text are usually minor.
 
2. Do you even need the book? Graded homework and weekly quizzes generally indicate yes. 
 
Do you know someone who's taken the class from this prof last semester that you can ask? Even my accounting classes tend to have professors so thorough with lecture PowerPoints that I've never cracked the book.
 
If different homework questions are the only deal breaker, make a friend in your class and see if they'll go with you to the library one day so you can scan or copy just the homework question pages (using the ground floor copiers just to scan to a PDF is free)
 
3. Check the bulletin board in the library basement for book ads. Maybe res halls? Anyone know of other open bulletin boards?
 
4. Check the Half Price Books on Campbell and call the one on NW Highway. This works better for gen ed classes, but I have gotten lucky once or twice.
 
5. Chegg.com - I have used them for multiple semesters. If you don't keep the book, rent.
 
6. Amazon and other textbook sites
 
7. Google the publisher's website for the text. Some of them are offering cheaper e-copies.
 
Bookmark the site to later take advantage of any free study guides or review quizzes.

8. eBay - international editions are usually cheap and identical to the US versions.
 
9. Google, both by ISBN and title/author. Look for torrents or PDFs. Sometimes you can even find study guides or homework solutions. Prior editions of those are even still handy.

10. Is the book on reserve at the library? Scan it by chapter."

mariesoleil,rollerderby,1389471748.0,"First of all, do not skate with no gear especially if you aren't already a good roller skater. It's pretty common for someone to be all excited about roller skating and plan on buying safety gear later. Then they hit a tiny rock on a path and scrape their knees up very badly, and won't skate again, or for years. 

Make sure that you are using outdoor wheels. I feel bad asking you to spend $200 or so on gear right now, but this will keep you safe. But there isn't a way around it; derby isn't a cheap hobby like running. Gear is expensive. One year or two into derby and you will really want to get some fancy pretty custom skates. Monthly dues could be $25-$50. You'll probably have to pay for your own jersey. I'm not trying to dissuade you, but you have to be realistic.

Hang out with derby girls, they will tell you what to work on. [These](http://wftda.com/resources/wftda-minimum-skill-requirements.pdf) are the ""basic skills"" that you will have to learn eventually. Some of them are stuff you can work on yourself, sections 1-3. Google as much as possible, ask here, etc.. Unfortunately there isn't much ""learn derby skills"" on youtube, but there is some. Make sure to practice all the stops, since they take a bit of work. Transitions and crossovers are also critical skills that you need to master.

In other cases, animals are bred with the intention of releasing the offspring into the wild, as was the case with the zoo's rhinos and the intention with the lemurs (who all failed their survivability tests due to laziness...). I believe Pike was part of the breed-to-release program who was deemed unsuited for release and therefor kept to breed and try again. 

One of the greatest conservation efforts to which these animals contribute is conservation through education. I cannot recall the exact quote, but it's something along the lines of, ""We only save what we care about; we only care about what we know and see."" Zoos like the SF Zoo stress public education and awareness about these animals and their status in the wild, and how the general population can work to save them from extinction."

Over the past thirty years, this outcome has grown LESS likely, not more likely.  We are by no means non-warlike; just watch the news.

We've just put limitations on ourselves.  We always have; note that chemical weapons were never deployed by any side during WWII, despite the fact that they had been developed and used in WWI.  Hitler and Stalin, two of the most brutal, psychotic rulers in human history, fought head to head, both believing that the very essence of their culture was at stake, without either ever considering the use of chemical weapons--Hitler especially having been haunted by memories of WWI.

Whether this happens out of some modicum of respect for the species as a whole, or out of ""what if we lose the war"" fears of reprisal, I contend that SOME degree of restraint will always be used in our future conflicts--at least to the point that we won't wipe out humanity as a whole."

robinhoode,BitcoinSerious,1389472169.0,"&gt; Wei Dai's B-money proposal is a precursor idea to Bitcoin. In his essay, published on the cypherpunks mailing-list in November 1998, he proposed two protocols. The first protocol is impractical as it requires a broadcast channel that is unjammable as well being synchronous.
&gt; 
&gt; In the first protocol in the essay, the use of a proof of work function is proposed as a means of creating money. Dai's B-Money was proposed in the context of cypherpunks mailing-list discussions relating to possible applications of Hashcash, the first symmetric proof-of-work function, which was itself also published on the same mailing-list, the previous year - May 1997. (Like the B-money proposal, bitcoin itself also uses the hashcash cost-function as the proof-of-work during coin minting). In B-Money, money is transferred by broadcasting the transaction to all participants, all of whom keep accounts of all others. Contracts can be made with possible reparation in case of default, with a third party agreeing to be the arbitrator. If there is no agreement, each party broadcasts arguments or evidence in its favor and each of the participants determines the reparations/fines in his accounts for himself.

Or, Eragon -- the Inheritance Cycle has sold 33 million copies, and the movie was total flop -- lost $25 million and critics hated it.

Plus, I finally found [sales figures](http://www.yalsa.ala.org/thehub/2012/03/19/the-hunger-games-by-the-numbers/) for The Hunger Games *before* the movie was announced:  4.3 million.

These women characters like the elf girl do things I would never think of doing nor have I ever seen a real woman do. They don't do things I admire. Like, okay she can shoot really well with her bow but she is nothing like Katniss, who has real compassion that is palpable and does these awful jobs that she has to do because she is the one that has to do them. The strength of a woman is how much she can go through and still come out with her sense of self in tact in the long game. She can be abused, be raped, have her nose cut off, but ten years later she has a family and says that she still has her faith in humanity. That's a real woman character. And she's not trying to be a man, because we all have seen men fall completely apart and had to carry them. She puts her ego aside for herself and for others. That's what I didn't see in that elf girl."

My SO works as a primary school teacher in an area where most of her children come from families living on/under the poverty line. The high street is pretty much dead, jobs are thin on the ground, there is a **lot** of alcohol/drug abuse and I can't walk down the street holding her hand because of the rampant homophobia... but we kind of have to count our blessings on that front because the racism is even worse. Basically, it's not a fun place to grow up. 

With all due seriousness, sometimes parents do crack and just don't take proper care of their kids but, assuming parents don't become neglectful/abusive for whatever reason, they do put a fair amount of thought into how to adequately feed their kids at as little cost as possible. Aside from people who work at fast food places bringing home free food from work because, hey, free food, **I have NEVER met someone there who honestly believes that they can feed a family for less if they use junk food**. 

The whole 'calorie dense' argument which I see going round of Tumblr just never comes up with anyone I know there because they're not looking for what will just give their family energy for the next few hours, they can't afford to be that short sighted. They are looking for the cheapest way to meet their nutritional needs and a burger or pizza isn't going to offer that. Yeah, there are limits to the types of food you can get (my SO nearly had a hernia when she realised that if she wanted pasta she'd have to go look in the 'world foods' section of the supermarket) but it is way, way cheaper to cook than it is to eat crap, even if it's just on a hot plate - necessity is the mother of innovation and all that. There are parents who have been so utterly failed by the education system that they have to come in for meetings with my SO because they can't read their children's school reports who know that. 

It really pisses me off how many people will quote studies on 'the poor' in 'some areas' and make sweeping statements based on that - it's not specific *at all* and, whilst anecdote does not build a convincing argument, it'd be nice if I could at least believe that they'd spent at least **some** time with people who are really struggling financially. As it is, most of the time I just feel that it's really patronizing - no one wants your pity or condescension, don't force it on others because they don't have as much as you do.

But while Walter White unleashed an inner monster and ended up being a cold, power hungry, manipulative person, he also twisted himself into thinking it was all okay. To him, he didn't change his basic codes, he just made more excuses. That is, until the end, when he realized that he was Heisenburg, not Walter White anymore, and went out with a bang. I applaud all of that... but Don Draper, in my personal opinion, has seen more character development. We have seen Don go from essentially a fake persona, where he was convincing himself that he was happy in someone else's life, to gradually accepting his real self. If you watch an episode from the first season, and an episode from the most recent, you'll find two very different people. But it was so subtle, and it's not in an outward transformation (like Walt) as much as a complete inward transformation. 

You probably just haven't noticed the change because of how well they wrote it all in. I'm telling you--watch two episodes from seasons spaced far apart and you'll notice that he is a different person on the inside. The writers did an incredible job writing that character. 

Again, this is all my opinion. I think many shows out there are great."

I love all their albums though (they are extremely prolific). It's cool to listen to them chronologically and see them go from a lo-fi rock band, to a folk band, then into pop and psych rock, then they start messing with electronics and snowball from there before returning to a traditional indie-pop rock band. The lyrics also tell the story of Barnes's life - both his mental state and physical life changes.

EOverM,AskMen,1389473014.0,"Debatable - I'd say that it's highly unlikely that we won't live to see the Singularity, and that's by definition a strong AI.  The point of a strong AI, incidentally, is that it wasn't specfically created with a purpose in mind - it's not like AI in games, which follows concrete rules.  All thought towards how one would be created follows neural net structures - create a framework that can learn and expand itself to account for new stimuli, then put it in a powerful enough computer and let it run.  Over time, you get a more and more complex and intelligent system.  The best ones I've heard about have been roughly comparable to animal intelligences - cats and dogs, say - but the only real limitations are how long it runs for and the stimuli it can be exposed to.  With the rate that computing power is increasing, and especially given that viable quantum computers probably aren't more than a couple of decades away, it won't be long before we can get to a cat-level intelligence in a fraction of the time it takes now.  Therefore, run the same net for the time you did on a slower machine, and you get an exponentially more powerful intelligence.  Add in all the different interaction methods that newer technology is introducing, and you accelerate the development further.  It's always a bad idea to put a timeframe on predictions, but realistically I'd expect to see the first human-level strong AI within fifty years or so.  I could well be wrong, but I really think it's inevitable.

I see your point, certainly, but I don't think you're basing it on enough information.  Yes, if technology stays how it is now, we won't see strong AI inside of a century or more likely several.  However, it isn't staying the same, it's developing at an ever-increasing rate.  That very increase is what will lead to the Singularity (which, in case you don't know, is the point at which technological development starts increasing faster than humans can push it - as in, the technology itself is driving its own improvements), and the curve suggests it won't be long."

Broadly, defamation usually has to involve either statements which are either demonstrably false *or* **not demonstrably true** and which are considered defaming or libelous to the individual in question.

In the UK it's much easier to win a libel suit, and that was the subject of a pretty extensive legal battle a few years back ([BCA v. Singh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA_v._Singh)). Situations like that seem to require that the party in question was libeled *in the UK* though, not necessarily by a UK-based company.

Because it's so easy to sue for libel in the UK, it might very well be libelous to point out what Zidonuke actually did in the past with the implication that a current project is not trustworthy because of his involvement.

Edit: That being said, this whole thing is laughable. CF can tell TShock to piss up a flagpole and even if they actually want to lawyer up I don't think there's much they can do about it."

""Steve Greatwood is in the midst of his 21st season coaching Oregon’s offensive line, as well as his 26th year on the Ducks’ coaching staff.""

""Oregon’s longest-tenured football coach in school history also is unsurpassed among the nation’s Bowl Championship Subdivision active coaches with the longest continuous full-time service at one school.
But more important than Gary Campbell’s longevity has been his true passion for the players he mentors on and off the field.
    What has resulted has been the most prolific rushing attack in school history as he enters his 30th season tutoring the Ducks’ running backs.""

""John Neal, who has accumulated 30 years of experience tutoring defensive secondaries in the Pac-10, SEC, Conference USA and WAC, is now engaged in his 10th season with Oregon.""

""One of the most overlooked elements in the success of Oregon’s student-athletes is Jim Radcliffe, now in his 26th year as the school’s head strength and conditioning coach.""

""Few coaches have been as successful developing talent as Don Pellum, who also continues to be involved in much of the program’s recruiting efforts in addition to coaching the team’s middle and weak-side linebackers.
    Possessing 32 years of expertise in the realm of collegiate athletics as a player, coach and administrator., he completed his playing career with the Ducks in 1984.

TheLittleGoodWolf,AskMen,1389473117.0,"As someone who hasn't been to America (yet) and raised in a country where circumcision is rare, I have a theory.

In the 80's more than 80% of children were circumcised, now that figure is down to around 32%. There are several generations where most of the male population were circumcised and it has become a multi million dollar industry. Because of this a majority of the population (including a lot of medical personnel) have ""forgotten"" what the foreskin does and what to do with it (for the most part just leave it be). The major ""excuse"" for circumcision was phimosis and hygiene and this has gotten quite firmly rooted in the society. Again this in only from my observations and simply a theory.

It's similar to how in the 1600's (or a long ass fucking time ago) when people thought it was unsanitary to bathe. This was due to the fact that they didn't change the water and so it got contaminated and people got sick and died after bathing, go figure.

Most foreskin related problems come from forced retraction of it in the early years. It is in fact one of the most common causes for phimosis (real phimosis that is). Couple this with the fact that no one really knows much about foreskins and you end up where we are today.

There is some interesting reading on the history of circumcision, especially from docktor Kellog (yup, that Kellog)."

mbise,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389473322.0,"Resisting arrest is illegal. If you break the law, even if someone else is doing something wrong or breaking the law, you've still broken the law (unless the law provides that the actions were justified). You don't get to resist arrest just because you're not guilty, especially if there is sufficient evidence to warrant arrest, or people would constantly be resisting arrest over their innocence.

From another side, consider a more extreme version of that situation. If you commit a crime while imprisoned for something you are later found innocent of, you are still responsible for those crimes (even if it comes out as ""time served""), even though you shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389473623.0,"[Here's a good rent vs buy calculator](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html).  Remember that you have to live somewhere. 

[The FHA subsidizes first-time homebuyers who can't afford 20% down](http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/topics/buying_a_home).  Most people in expensive areas can't afford a 20% down payment.  The FHA's terms are nowhere near as good as they were 5 years ago, but they still put people in homes who couldn't afford it otherwise.  If you haven't talked to a mortgage broker about this, you need to.  Mortgage brokers exist to make this happen for people who aren't sure how to make it happen.

Mortgage interest is a huge tax deduction.  That's a subsidy from the Fed Gov't on your plans to buy a home.  Every year you don't take advantage of it you're shafting yourself.

There are always compromises.  24K on preschool may be too much.  Staying in your own zipcode and each of you driving separately to work in a fancy car may be too much - there are other neighborhoods, mass transit, carpooling, mommy-sharing for daycare responsibilities.  A lot of my techie couple friends get by with one car.

Finally, there is the question of whether you will need to rent in retirement.  If you won't - if you can look forward to a date when you might own a home free and clear - you might not need to be saving quite so much in your 401(k) today.

I agree that getting your withholding right and not knowing where $24K a year after-tax is going are sort of major issues that you might want to take a closer look at.

I also sort of echo the concerns others have expressed about leasing cars, paying for a really expensive preschool, and living next door to Bill Gates.  You are expressing certain decisions as if you really didn't think that they were decisions you made, rather, as if they were immutable reality that could never be changed.  I understand it's nice to live near Bill Gates, have a short commute, and send your kid to the Bugatti Veyron of preschools, but if you are doing those things and can't afford to own your own house, you might want to take a really careful look at yourself, your goals, and your decisions; and then ask, ""Are these decisions I'm making really getting me closer to where I want myself and my family to be someday?"""

Most of the posts are about learning how to not offend people when you want some time alone or how to survive long periods of socialising. Now that I think about it I've not seen ANY posts actively denouncing extroverts, and I've been subbed for a couple of months now. The ones that do have a mildy negative view of extroverts are (almost) always reprimanded.

jianadaren1,TrueTrueReddit,1389473922.0,"&gt;Nowhere in the article does the author admit that maybe voting Republican isn't against the best interests of the working class. 

No, he does.

&gt;But are voters really voting against their self-interest when they vote for candidates who share their values? Loyalty, respect for authority and some degree of sanctification create a more binding social order that places some limits on individualism and egoism. As marriage rates plummet, and globalisation and rising diversity erodes the sense of common heritage within each nation, a lot of voters in many western nations find themselves hungering for conservative moral cuisine.

He doesn't appear to make any point about the inferiority of Republican economic policies (and why would he? the entire essay is arguing that these policies aren't an important factor in voter decision-making). While it's pretty clear that he's at least left-leaning, he doesn't do anything to disparage the right, unless you're catching a whiff of cynicism when he describes the right as being more aware of the phenomenon he's describing:

&gt; It's more about a moral vision that unifies a nation and calls it to greatness than it is about self-interest or specific policies. In most countries, the right tends to see that more clearly than the left."

A separate (not as thorough in my opinion) analysis can be found in their 1995 article pages 2-5 though they speak to it from the perspective of I which is more complex.

In essence it's a pair procedure, the exact timing is going to depend on environmental context.  If every time someone said ""giggy"" you got attention/enjoyable things that resulted in dopamine (that feel good neuroransmitter), you'd probably start responding to ""giggy"".  We more or less do that with kids.  The name is paired with a physiological and followed by other fun stuff like attention so we attend to it.

You can build solar power plants which produce energy cells to power jump drives and other factories, you can build space farms that produce a variety of different foods and require different resources to do so, factories that produce a bunch of different weapons, microchips, jump drives and all sorts of components that are only used in other production lines. All of these stations also require the basic necessities like energy cells and food. Now, this game probably won't support the player count needed for a system of commerce that matches X3 in size and complexity but there are many ways to introduce additional challenges into the game, assuming you don't go the Minecraft route. 

The problem with the Minecraft crafting system is that once you've got the basics in place you can survive forever and craft anything as long as you're willing to spend the time to gather resources. Everything can be made from a small collection of crafting tables and since it's all manual, there is no need to specialize and no reason why you couldn't have everything. You don't have to trade with other players because they don't have anything that you couldn't easily  get by simply investing the time to find it. Space is different in the sense that asteroids with rare materials aren't scattered about a kilometer apart. By introducing a more complex crafting system which requires a series of components as opposed to the abstract assembler that assembles anything manually you can force players to specialize in different areas and interact with each other. If it takes a lot of effort to build, control and protect a giant space station that produces fuel or energy cells, the operators of that station have an added incentive to trade their surplus fuel for food, ship parts or protection instead of spreading themselves too thin by trying to produce everything by themselves. Even if the actual production is automated problems could still arise by having computer systems break down and require several tiers of components to build.

That's the sort of challenge I'm hoping for in survival. Not a bland crafting system where you input a bunch of materials into your assembler and a second later you pull out four thousand units of fuel or three hundred building blocks but something where I am encouraged to think about outside factors like protecting my power plant from meteor showers, space pirates and other players. Even the most basic economy would be a big step up in terms of multiplayer dynamics. That's not to say that there isn't a place for the assembler in the game, just that it could be limited in some way. Maybe it only produces basic items, maybe it takes longer to produce items than specialized equipment, etc etc."

- Threshold for negative thirst effects lowered (You can survive longer w/o water)

- Bleeding effects doubled (You'd bleed twice as fast upon suffering injury)

-Need double the amount of bandages to stop bleeding.


*Also*, I think the game could make excellent use of its HDR-mechanics by making it possible to **turn on the light in a building** **while being outside**.

This would create a kind of trap at night. Imagine you fix the light in a whole hospital (with a portable generator for example) but you let a wire run outside the hospital to you, letting you turn on the light in it *from outside*. This means players *inside* can't see anything past a few meters outside anymore and are exposed at the same time.
Man, this is so complicated to explain.

*And* more **reasons to stay attached to your character**. Right now it's like ""ehh, oh well, I can loot again.""

-*Stamina* 1% increased running speed.

-*Calm Mind* 5% better aim.

-*Silent* Ability to close/open doors silently. (I know right now every door is silent, but in the future...), 5% quieter movement, etc.

-*Perspicacious* 5% more zoom.

-*Nimble* 10% Chance to not get knocked out by a fist-punch to the head.

HumanSockPuppet,40krpg,1389474202.0,"&gt;I spent a couple of weeks working on the adaptation, and it's an ongoing process.

Interesting. I'll probably look into the FATE system now that you've elucidated it a bit for me.

&gt;I'm a sandbox GM, so I tend to spend a lot of time thinking about what is going on in the background.

I do the same thing. Instead of planning encounters for the players, I write very detailed backgrounds for my NPCs so that I have a good idea of how they'll react to whatever actions the PCs take (either with or against them). I don't have planned protagonist or antagonist NPCs - at least not at first. Rather, NPCs *become* allies or foes depending on how the actions of the PCs affect the NPCs' agendas.

It creates a much more organic storytelling experience, and gives the players a real sense of the impact that their actions have.

&gt;I'm pretty old school in tools.

Same here, though the availability to online tools has made game-management a lot easier than it used to be. I used flowcharting software to help managing NPCs relationships, but even then, it often turns into a spaghetti nightmare of arrows and crisscrossing agendas.

&gt; I don't usually draw maps in advance, because that tends to feel like I'm forcing combat encounters on the players.

Yeah. You can always tell when a battle has been planned, and it feels less significant. A spontaneous battle is always more exciting, and players respond very well to it, because then they can never quite predict when a conflict might arise. Perfect for a dangerous ""crapsack"" setting like WH40K.

One thing I enjoy doing is to design maps based on scenario ""templates"". So for example, I have maps which incorporate fighting in cramped close quarters, maps which involve fighting with variances in elevation, or maps which have sparse cover and wide-open areas, forcing combatants to move tactically in order to flank or close to melee distance. The *exact* setting of these templates is left open so that they can occur aboard starships, deep within caves, or on the surface of lethal Deathworlds - whatever the situation calls for.

&gt;Interestingly, the default ""PVP"" resolution in Fate is not to go to the dice, but rather, it's by table consensus. You ask the table what they think should happen, and if they both want to go to the dice, they can.

I like this idea. You're right - it requires very mature players who can divorce their character's agendas from the impartial execution of the plot. But it can create interesting dramatic situations, and it also helps to mollify enmities between players so no one goes home feeling scorned or cheated. The Season 1 highlights of Fate40K were fun to read, but I spent a lot of time wondering how you were able to resolve the PC conflicts without having players ragequit the game.

I suspect that my game is going to run into just such a PvP situation before too long, so I appreciate having some input on how to handle it.

&gt;advanced degree in the mathematics

That'll do it. There aren't enough game-designers with mathematics and CS degrees, so games usually end up horrendously unbalanced (like Dungeons &amp; Dragons)."

bosh-head,Guildwars2,1389474341.0,"&gt; just to make it so defense should actually be a factor in some way.

Defense is already a factor for players who do not have the skill for full zerker builds, or do not have the knowledge of a dungeon (knowing what to dodge, where to stand, etc), for a full zerker build.

&gt; that would mean that glass offense is no longer the end-all way to play. 

No, it absolutely wouldn't change that at all. You'd *still* want to be as glass as you possibly could, if you had the skill for that. What would change is how glassy that is.

&gt; it would increase build diversity (which is basically nonexistent in pve)

Shifting people to lower-DPS builds doesn't increase build diversity. What happens is: People running 100% zerker will now run 75%. People who ran 75% will now run 50%. People who ran 50% will now run 25%. People who ran 25% will now run with no zerker.

It's a shift that lowers effective DPS for *EVERYONE*. It doesn't change build variety at all, because you're actually removing one option (full zerker). If anything, it reduces build variety.

&gt; it's easy as hell to succeed without defense in gw2.

I think you have a skewed understanding of how bad the average gw2 player actually is. You're on a gw2 forum, you're probably in contact with very few genuinely bad players.

Do you know the reason ""daily dodger"" was added to dailies? Because anet had statistics on how often people dodged, and there was a large percentage of players that just never dodged.

Your average player only occasionally runs dungeons, and they're pretty bad at it. If Anet moves forward with the kind of changes you're suggesting, those players will either be locked out of doing dungeons at all, or else they'll need to run them in full power-vit-toughness gear (what a lot of bad players do already).

If dungeons are made harder, the effect will be to increase the elitism, not decrease it. You'll see more LFG groups demanding high-DPS setups, and demanding people link their gear, etc, to keep out the people who can't survive without full PVT.

Decreasing the cards lifetime and increase electricity costs. I'm not saying you can't run it like this but is it absolutely necessary. 

The reason it's not using the overclock that you set is because sometimes it doesn't need to use the increased clock speeds to output the fps you are looking to get. Either that or it is throttling itself because it is too hot or the clock speeds are too high for it to handle.

Up to you, just giving advice."

They work with the art director to come up with sets, graphic designers for graphics, and prop masters for props. They serve the directors vision for how the physical assets in the movie are going to look. Sometimes they work with costumes as well. In VFX, we don't get to work with the PD because they're off the show after shooting has wrapped, but we do have to continue their look with CG set extensions and the like."

sheenathepunkrocker,TumblrInAction,1389474873.0,"What it says in the Bhagavad-Gita is that the rituals aren't really what's important, it's how you choose to live your life.  So if you're living a moral, and spiritual life in line with Sri Krishna's or another god/prophet's teaching, then you're good to go.  There's actually a few passages in there that could be interpreted (and are how I interpret them) as meaning that it doesn't really matter what specific religion you're following, as long as you follow their teachings to be a good person, you can become one with God after death (sort of like heaven).  There are even some Hindus who recognize people like Jesus, Muhammad, Abraham and Buddha as incarnations of the god Vishnu (which is what they believe people like Sri Krishna were).  

So basically, as I understand things, you're right.  Sorry for rambling, I just think that this stuff interesting and some of it happens to be similar to what I think about religion and God."

I picked up programming as a student because it was something to do, plus I enjoyed it as a creative outlet (as unintuitive as that might sound, it really can be), and it really paid off after I graduated and realized that the demand for coders was much, much greater than for writers.

Noone's going to answer yes, that shit's a blatantly loaded question.

Personally, I could wait a while but the relationship unlikely to be as initially strong as someone who I could have sex with. I have a high libido, and no sex is testy.

My problem would be the reasons, not the actual act. Honestly, sounds like you were raped and have a bad conception of sex because of it. I'd suggest talking to someone about it. That burdening negative view of men you have seems more of a problem than the rest, for a relationship with me. I'm black and the wealth of ""You're not like the rest of those _pejorative_ black people,"" have made me wary of anything similar. Especially, ""You're not like the rest of men, followed by a pejorative description of a ""normal"" man.""

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskReddit,1389475659.0,/u/Unidan appears when the student is ready for instruction.
WinterCharm,apple,1389475660.0,"* As a media center the app PLEX is your friend. https://plex.tv/downloads

* Before you dig deeper into Plex, become familiar with the mac itself. Watch these videos: http://support.apple.com/videos/#macos has some great videos for becoming familiar with the mac. 

* Finally, I'll copy and paste what I told another mac user in your position a while ago: 

&gt; 1. You do not need antivirus on a mac. Do not install it, as it's pretty much a waste of your time.
2. Set up time machine backups immediately. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1427 Time machine is painless automated backup. You'll want an external hard drive for this.
3. Make sure you set up iCloud - it includes the Find My Mac service in case your mac is ever lost/stolen, it'll give you a chance to recover it. It also will sync any contacts/calendar info/reminders/notes and more between your iPhone and mac. :) This can be done by going to System Preferences &gt;&gt; iCloud.
4. Most of the native software on OS X is really really good. Don't download alternatives until you've given all of it a chance. I haven't had to install a different email client, or anything like that. I still use safari for web browsing, etc.
5. If you're new to OS X, you'll probably want to see these videos: http://support.apple.com/videos/#macos They are extremely helpful, if a bit simple.
6. If you want to run a second operating system simultaneous (virtualized) use Virtualbox(free), or VmWare Fusion($60). I use VmWare Fusion because the interface is much friendlier, etc. If you want to play games on your mac, use bootcamp, and partition the mac to install windows. Warning! DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PARTITION TOOLS BESIDES BOOTCAMP, which already comes on every mac.
7. You get a home folder, with your name on it (whatever you choose). Set finder to always open to this folder (In the menu bar at the top, click Finder &gt;&gt; Preferences &gt;&gt; General &gt;&gt; New Finder Windows show ______. and select your home folder (the one with the house icon) from the drop down. Keep all your files in your home folder! this will ensure that they get backed up, and will keep you from getting disorganized.

* Okay, so besides all that, the hotkeys on OS X are basically the same as windows. They just use the Cmd key instead of the Ctrl key. :) Press the Cmd Key with your thumb (that's why it's right there on the keyboard) and then tap C to copy V to paste, X to cut. W to close a window, Z to undo. Shift + Cmd + [key] typically does the opposite of a function. Shift Cmd Z = redo, for example. 

* Hold down the alt key in any menu to see hidden options. :) 

* Finally, if you're an experienced linux user, you'll *love* the OS X terminal. The commands are almost the exact same. Help, Cd, Sudo, ls, etc. You'll feel right at home here :) 

* All system settings are under System Preferences. All application preferences are under the menu bar name for that application and then ""Preferences"" - for example, ""Finder &gt; Preferences"" and ""iTunes &gt; Preferences"" will get you to the preferences for each application. Menus are consistent, which is what makes OS X so easy to use :) 

* Use the help menus! :D They let you search for commands, instead of the useless help and support documents that windows typically gives you. [Here's what i mean](http://www.acrobatfaq.com/atbref5/images/TBX_v5_0_0_Menu_Apple_Help.png) - It's really helpful when you can't find something you know exists... :) 

* For most everything, use the default apps at first. You will need a few extra apps for it to be able to play certain video formats. PLEX lets you organize all your movies, TV shows, and more. MPlayer X (free on the mac app store) will let you play any video format. For everything else - calendar, mail, contacts, etc. I just use the OS X default apps. They are fantastic :)

But you are correct in saying that even then, they normally have some sort of billing. A public service will *never* be cost effective, which was my point. Policing and fire are big holes in the proverbial ground that we throw money into because we recognize that on the rare occasion when we *do* need those services, they are urgently needed. EMS is no different but we are stuck on the mentality of treating it like a business, because that's how it started (Just like police and fire).

Scene starts of with Marlin already on the Journey to find Nemo.

He meets Dorthy.

Dorty questions his journey. What are you doing? Who's Nemo? Why are you looking for him?

Flashback to the moment that Nemo get's captured.

Marlin looks guilty. Blames humans for everything. He continues his journey.

Get further along on his journey,  meets the turtles, meets the sharks, passes the jellyfishes, meets the whale. With each new event we learn a little bit more who Nemo is. First we find out that Marlin loves Nemo. Next Nemo get's captured. He blames everybody else for this. Why didn't you watch him better, why didn't you stop him, why did they take him away? Every event gets us closer to the truth. We finally find out why Marlin cares about Nemo so much? We learn about what happened to him and his family. We learn about their death, about his feelings of powerlessness. He learn that Nemo was the only survivor.

It gets to the end. This story was never about Marlin looking for Nemo. Nemo was lost a long time ago. Fact is, there was never a Nemo in the first place. Marlin was looking for ""Nobody"". This whole journey was about Marlin accepting the truth. Death passed him by and he lost everything. 

It ends with Marlin realizing that everything has been in his head all along. The lost of his son, the kidnapping. Everything that he told us was a lie he unconsciously made up, a fabrication of his imagination to deal with his despair. Marlin has truly found ""Nemo"".

""Women should be more forward"" is a popular opinion to hold these days; it makes sense, and it tends to make a guy go ""I wonder if I've missed out on a gal or two because they weren't forward enough."" But our culture is still one where we're used to labeling one behavior in men as 'authoritative' and in women as 'bossy', and that only goes away with effort and self-awareness. So someone might think they like women who are straight-forward, believe that if women were more straight-forward everyone would be happier, and still have a knee-jerk reaction of ""Wow, you're bossy"" when these women are encountered in real life."

This is my first fast longer than 40 hrs though I'm not planning to go for as long as you (I'm shooting for 7-10 days depending on how I feel).

So I didn't confront him.  

There is no doubt in my mind that if I had confronted him with my rage, I would be in prison.  Overall, it was just a very powerless feeling.

Not to sound cheesy, but I don't hate him now, and I don't hate her either.  I pity them more than anything.  It's just one of those things where after years of self-loathing and depression, you come to a point when you either dwell on it for the rest of your life, or you try to move on.  Life does suck a lot, but there are good things as well.  Maybe those are the things worth living for?  

I have a girlfriend now who knows about the entire ordeal and is very gentle and affectionate towards me.  I don't know if I'm going to marry her, but it's comforting to know that I'm at least taking steps forward in life, which I think is what life is all about.

the short version of my long-winded rant: i cope with music, drugs, and escorts.

most people can't even conceive of the problems short men face and often counter our claims with disbelieving aggressiveness. even some short guys, through some miracle of luck or naivety, deny the reality that exists for a lot (most?) of us. they'll tell you you're overreacting, and give such sage advice as ""be more confident.""

ultimately you have to decide for yourself whether or not the bullshit you went through is because of your awful attitude (as they'll claim), or something else that you have no control over. if it's the latter, again...you'll have to decide how to live with that. there is no easy answer."

Hovsky,AskHistorians,1389477263.0,"You will notice that many of the rifles from your link *are* the same ones that were standard issue at the time, or just before the war.

The M1903 was the US issue rifles up to - and for the Marines, including - WWII. It was, of course, replaced by the M1 Garand, and continued in use as a sniper rifle. As you vaguely allude to, the Garand was also used as a sniper rifle, in the form of the M1-D.

The British sniper rifle was the Lee Enfield. The standard issue was (I believe) the SMLE (Short Magazine Lee Enfield) variant, while snipers likely used the original, longer rifle.

The Japanese issue rifle was the Arisaka Type 99. Again, the sniper rifle was a lightly modified variant.

Russia, certainly, issued the same rifle to regular infantry as snipers. The Mosin was used for both; rifles that tested better at the factory were sent to snipers.

Germany also used the same series for regular infantry and snipers. The Gewehr 98 was initially the German issue rifle, followed (in WWII) by the shorter variant - the Kar 98k. The Gewehr 98 was given optics and issued to snipers.

As you can see, your example of the US service/sniper rifles is the exception, rather than the rule, for the major belligerents of WWII.

BuildMyPaperHeart,AskMen,1389477291.0,"Yeah, you're right, your features don't help. But I, like you, had the wrong idea about what confidence means. To me, it means two things: initiative and knowledge of self.

**Initiative:** Ask her out. Or, smaller steps: Give her a small surprise like a flower if you're familiar, or something on Valentine's Day perhaps. Go out of your way to do something nice (a note when she's feeling a bit down), or listen to her when she talks to you and engage in good conversation. *Easier said than done. MUCH easier said. But I'm working on it*

**Self-Awareness:** Be independent and be you, whether that means going to parties or staying at home playing video games. Do what you're interested in, and show genuine interest when those topics come up. Don't compromise and pretend you don't like Star Wars because one person thinks it's nerdy; there are ten others in the room who will probably share in your fandom.

The ""confidence"" thing, as a whole, isn't necessarily all about projecting yourself as confident (though it is in part that), but rather understanding that the woman you're looking for, the one you want to love, will love you for all the quirks and dumb things you do just as much as the normal, awesome traits you have. It's about being okay with being let down by a good number of women, because at the end of the day, you're not looking for any woman. You're looking for a specific kind of woman, one who meets your interests and preferences, and that takes some time. Until then, simply be honest about who you are, what you like to do, and what you're about. 

Just know that once you think you've found her, the dreaded task of asking is up to you. Most of the time, anyway."

Hovsky,AskHistorians,1389477492.0,"Now on to your statement about the action of a sinper's weapon.

Bolt-actions are intrinsically more accurate than semi-autos, due to the much smaller number of moving parts during the firing of the weapon. This allows the muzzle to remain on target more accurately and for longer.

Unless suppressed, the difference in the report of the weapon is not very significant between a semi-auto and a bolt-action, given the muzzle report which is orders of magnitude louder.

The issue of the shiny brass may have been a small issue, though I have not heard anything of that.

&gt;A bolt action rifle would allow the shooter to lay motionless after the shot, and carefully cycle the action to reload another cartridge at a time of their choosing, and potentially use their free hand to cover the ejector port and catch the spent casing.

steadymotion,TheRedPill,1389477511.0,"I don't think the animosity is at all directed towards the married women who decide to divorce (or if it is, then it's completely misguided). I think people are mad at divorce LAW, because it favors the woman when it's the woman who should be punished for breaking a supposedly binding contract. People think it is unfair because they hold the assumption that simply by getting married they will not put their capital at risk.

Let's say a woman can get a divorce whenever she wants, but she will receive NO money from the man, and will NOT get custody of her children. Similarly, a man can do the same thing and be given the same terms. In this case I don't think men would be so mad, and I also think you'd suddenly see marriages lasting a lot longer."

There are men who consider it to be tied to that awful lock and key saying, which I guess is similar to ""boys will be boys.""  However, there are also plenty of men who fall into the camp that say it shouldn't be a factor at all.

Personally I link sex and trust in a very major way.  I have always sought out men who viewed sex in a similar fashion, meaning no casual hookups or ONS.  People are free to seek otherwise or not care either way.  Whatever works for them."

That's exactly my hesitation. Specifically that a profession isn't (always) a person. (Nor being a student, although it's a nice cop out answer for awhile!) And that leads us to talking about work or school, etc., as if that's what is desired. Or if you say you're a movie geek, you're going to talk about movies -- which may be fine, unless you want a shot at something else. 

I think profession plus geographical history gets a little closer to revealing something useful about a person. Maybe you're lucky enough to have recently taken an exciting trip! If not, perhaps you're working on a project you can mention (if you like the project), or you have a claim to fame. It's tricky. I'm hoping to get some more ideas."

Mr_Clovis,pcmasterrace,1389477571.0,"[Spoilers for Tomb Raider &amp; The Last of Us below]

Though I enjoyed playing through Tomb Raider, I did have two big gripes with it.

The first was how the story and gameplay didn't seem to match. The story took itself extremely seriously, which was at odds with a gameplay that felt too arcade-like to hold the immersion. For example:

* Infinite rope arrows
* Lara is basically a superwoman jumping around like an acrobat on steroids
* The game makes a big deal about her killing someone for the first time, but after that it's no sweat to maul through hundreds of bad guys (despite her complete lack of experience)
* She gets impaled through her side but it has absolutely no consequence, other than some flashy screen effects and Lara holding her side for a few minutes - it's only there for show

All of these things *could* be fine on their own, except that - because of how the story was told - I felt that the game wanted me to take it a lot more seriously. But I couldn't. Maybe I was biased because I played it right after finishing The Last of Us, in which Joel also gets impaled, except it has a huge effect on the game and leads to one of the best gaming sequences I've ever played.

Compare it to Uncharted, in which Nathan Drake is also a kind of superman shrugging off bullet wounds as he piledrives through hundreds of enemies - but at least in the Uncharted series you get humor, witty statements about the ridiculous number of bad guys, and you also know that he has a criminal background and isn't new to that sort of stuff. Overall, that made it a lot easier to marry story and gameplay even if the gameplay wasn't realistic.

The second issue I had with Tomb Raider was how the story was so incredibly predictable. The player knows way before all of the characters do that the island won't let them leave and that the priest is going to try to sacrifice Lara's friend. But we still get dragged through their extremely slow-paced discovery of all of these facts and it just felt like the characters were playing catch-up to the player. This especially bothered me because the story goes to such lengths to try to make it seem as though the island is some huge mystery when in reality, it was really somewhat transparent."

newsedition,OkCupid,1389477580.0,"For waiting until the divorce is finalized? I don't want to bring anybody along for what might be a roller-coaster of a ride for the next few months. I didn't wait the last time I got divorced (although that was quite a different situation), and it resulted in the marriage that is currently ending. I'm not *sure* that waiting would have helped, but it might have.

For the vasectomy? I already have a son and a step-daughter who I'm not divorcing, even though her mom and I are going to splitsville. (I've been her step-dad since before she was 2, and I'm her brother's father. That's not really going to go away.) I love kids, but I don't feel the need to make any more. I guess I could leave the window open for the right person changing my mind, but then again, I'm not sure that someone who wants more kids would actually be the right person. Regardless, I'm definitely fertile, and I don't want any ""happy accidents""."

dsklerm,AskWomen,1389477668.0,"I don't think you're accounting for your own impression.  There is a huge difference between ""oh I run blood tests and help nurses"" and ""I'm a doctor"".  For one, you're immediately dismissing and reducing the impact of your own job when you downplay it like that.  If you don't seem interested or engaged in it, why should they?

Also let's just be real.  Being a doctor is the fucking tits.  You save lives, you (potentially) are compensated for that in greater amounts than the average American, and you had to work very, very hard for a very, very long time to get where you are.  It may not be the money that appeals to them, but being a doctor has it's societal benefits, as well as financial.  

It's probably worth examining the type of women you're taking on dates too.  My guess is your doctor status would get you a lot less further in a hipster dive bar than say... A swanky cocktail lounge.  

If you're worried about your money being an issue you can seek out people who don't care about money and status.  There are plenty of women out there who are less than impressed with your bank account, and who may actually find it unappealing.  Status and stability are pretty awesome and appeal to a lot of people, but I don't think it's quite as big of a deal as you may think it is.  There are a lot of variables in this equation, and money is just one of them.  "

I'm not exactly sure where you're getting your wild generalizations about my lifestyle so I'll just respond to each individually. 


&gt;Do you think renaming alternative medicine to complementary medicine sufficiently masks the bullshit involved in it? 


I don't believe I ever stated this. You are using a strawman logical fallacy. Being rude and condescending to someone is not a way to encourage objective discussion. 


&gt;Do you think acupuncture, energy alignment and homeopathics really work?


I have never used acupuncture and don't know much about it, I cannot make any claims to its validity. I've never even heard of energy alignment. As for homeopathic medicine, I've used some that had results (black cohosh helped me go into labor and also helps with my severe period cramps) but also used some that had no results (neighbors allergy medicine). I do not use homeopathic medicine as an alternative to seeing a physician if I need to. 


&gt;Have you had a bad experience with a doctor who didn't treat you as you wanted and now you generalize that disdain

I have not had a problem with any doctor in my life, except for my ob-gyn about 6 years ago. I felt she really lacked on giving me informed consent and that my c-section was medically unnecessary. However, I do not generalize that disdain, I simply chose another provider. 


&gt;or are you just into the woo medicine b/c it's ""spiritual""


I'm not sure how to reply to this strawman, so I'm just gonna let you know I'm an atheist. 


&gt;""Understanding"" disease as having a spiritual by the way should strongly imply to you that the ""professional"" you are seeking treatment from lacks objectivity.


I don't know about this part, as I lack spirituality to be treated, although it's never been brought up at my doctors appointments. Although, I do like having a doctor that sits down to talk to me about things that are going on in my life and how environmental factors might play into my problems. It amazes me that my doctor actually spends time getting to know her patients. She's in there for the whole appointment! I've never had a doctor that has done this, how sad is that?

With that being said, I have had her prescribe me medications, offer me medications that I've declined, and never push anything on me. I've been seeing her for 5 years off and on and I don't believe she's ever even mentioned to me about the acupuncturist she's attached to. 

I believe if anyone is lacking objectivity, it may be you. "

Most of the VFX that you don't notice in a movie come from the post production side of the process, where something that is shot doesn't look right on film, or in the cut. It's hard to explain if you've never tried to make a movie, but sometimes things look fake, even if they were real. It just doesn't translate to the camera. So for some of the words, art department put up real words on a wall, but Ben wanted to make them look better, so VFX was used. For other words, it was a simple roto and 2d or 3d track onto a background.

You had a few long casting time spells that did really high damage and a bunch of spells that we called nukes which did aoe damage to everyone around the target but little damage to the target themselves. These spells took very little time to cast and the stat that have you more mana also lowered casting time. So you would pull groups of mobs by blasting the most difficult one with a high damage output spell, then when they attacked you, just spam a bunch of air damage spells, most of which had less then .5sec cast times when you were higher lvl.

&gt;Reasons why: 1. It's a pump-action shotgun, and you'll notice he cycles it after the first 'misfire' - and no shell comes out. It's not misfiring, it's empty.

Have you never heard of a malfunctioning extractor? It's also possible he short stroked it.

&gt;2. When the blast knocks his hat off, notice that the sound is strangely cut off - that's because they dubbed it in.

The same is true for all three shots.

&gt;3. I may be wrong about this, but hundreds of TV detectives have taught me that things shot at close range get powder burns; his hat is clean as a whistle.

You can't possibly see that.

&gt;(Here's something I didn't have in my original post)
4) Recoil doesn't work like that.

Recoil actually looks very different when you're holding a gun and when it's leaning on the ground.

&gt;Guns are designed to transfer their energy cleanly to the projectile(s)

Seriously, what does this even mean? I'm not convinced *you* know what this means.

&gt;so what is causing the butt to shift a matter of inches to the side?

Which side? Either way, probably recoil or him shitting himself.

&gt;Also, you'll notice that the 'recoil' somehow aims the gun lower than it was originally aimed?

Yes, this is rather odd. It could depend on how he's holding the barrel."
darian66,CredibleDefense,1389478176.0,"Indeed, the helicopter issue in particular was one of the reasons the mission almost failed to get approval in parliament. 

After Srebrenica the government in The Hague got afraid of military ops without 100% guaranteed air support and aerial transport. That's why the Dutch F-16's were brought along to Afghanistan and its also the reason why those same F-16's almost got withdraw from NATO command during the Battle of Chora. The Dutch military doesn't like to be reliant on others on the aerial front.

This is naive. What equipment do you bring along for camping? Do you think the Amish synthesized those materials, or designed your camping equipment? Half or more of your equipment was designed on a computer. You are not **in** nature. You **are** nature. That includes everything you seem to dislike about the modern world.

&gt;I think a nine year old should be handwriting a journal not typing out a blog. 

Why?

&gt;Infants to age three should be kept away from electronic things as much as possible.

Why? Have you encountered research to back this up?

I asked what you think the purpose of education is and I didn't really get a clear answer. You just exhaustively listed examples of ""what"" to do, not ""why"". It's like I asked ""why is my car making a rattling noise"" and you listed a dozen of your friends who claim can fix the problem. Here's my answer for the purpose of education: ""to help students become curious and creative citizens of a strong and independent society"". I think your approach does not accomplish the goals of education in the world we live in today. What do you think the goal of education is?

&gt;They can learn about the adult world when they become teenagers and young adults because that is when it will matter to them.

Do you really think kids don't care about the modern world? When was the last time you spoke to kids (plural) about technology? That last question is not rhetorical, it would be nice to get an answer.

I don't want to sound too abrasive but you sound like the biggest Luddite I have ever spoken to. I don't think you have a current sense of what children are interested in, or how important technology is in their lives. We may have a lot to learn from each other but I'm having trouble even conceiving of such an extreme anti-technology stance.

Je serais surpris de voir qu'il y a plus de chrétiens qui portent une croix jugée ""ostentatoire"" que de fonctionnaires musulmanes qui portent un voile.

&gt; Donc, le voile n'est pas religieux. Cessons de parler d'atteintes à la liberté religieuse alors.

Si on admet qu'il soit possible que le voile ne soit pas religieux, il ne s'agit pas d'un symbole religieux ostentatoire, et donc l'état n'a aucune raison de le supprimer.

&gt; Si leurs convictions religieuses les empêchent de retirer leurs symboles religieux ostentatoires non religieux, ils n'auront qu'à renoncer à ces subventions.

C'est la définition de la discrimination.

&gt; À l'époque, on ne visait que les catholiques et non pas l'ensemble des pratiques religieuses dans la fonction publique.

Plus précisément, on visait tous les non-protestants, tout comme les lois proposées sont écrites pour viser les non-""catholiques non-pratiquants""  Même à l'époque, il y avait aussi des juifs contre qui la loi discriminait.

&gt; C'est un choix de société, comme favoriser l'accès à une éducation de qualité pour tous.

The fetus has no sense of consciousness, is not viable outside the womb, feels no pain, and is not even aware it exists yet. From the child's own perspective, there's no harm done at that point.

That being said, the woman had all the time in the world to decide whether she wanted the kid or not. If she had the kid, that's on her, even if the man originally helped make the kid. The man had only once chance to make a choice, while the woman has two, and that second one had an AWFUL long time window.

Beyond that, you're just making a meaningless values based argument."

AFormidableContender,confession,1389478498.0,"&gt;Unless you are severely disfigured, a guy is not going to die a virgin. There are very few people who are truly unable to find dates.

You really don't get it, but I suppose that's to be expected from a woman with your particular set of privileges....

Men want sex. Men do not want sex with unattractive people. The best a 4/10 can do, is a 4/10, and if he's lucky, he may live his life having only 1 or 2 sexual partners, where you could go to the club and die having literally 10000's of sexual partners. Men don't 1 partner when they can have 5, or 10, or 80, or 10000s. TRP is an ideology, that if followed, can maximize your ability to attract more, higher quality (better looking) women. 

That's all there is too it. Any argument by which you make necessitates men except a lower sexual partner count, which is contrary to the purpose of TRP and therefore, inneffective and moot. 

&gt;I'm not arrogant, or pretentious. I consider myself to be a very generous and caring person.

No, you're an arrogant, and pretentious asshole. You are expecting men to accept a lower quality of life because you think it's disrespectful towards a group of which you a member, whilst most of the members of your group do not respect the members of ours. With all your talk of male entitlement, you're the most entitled of all. 

&gt;There are people of any gender who will have sex with anyone. So yes, a woman could call up a guy like that, if she knows one, and he would be at her place in 15 minutes. Guys can too. There are women who will have sex with anyone.

Lol, no. The difference in value between the men women can score by virtue of the difference in the value of sex between genders is so significant that this argument is tired, poor, and contrived for this reason... 

The guys woman are picking up with ease look like this: http://i.imgur.com/z47Yvru.jpg

The girls guys are picking up with ease are of such desperation that they cannot leveridge sex for contributions of value and look like this: http://i.imgur.com/J4Y6ShC.jpg

&gt;If you meet a woman, and you know she wants a commitment, or at least a second date, and you sneak out in the middle of the night and never call her again, that's deceptive. It's not a crime or anything, but it's still wrong.

Yea, it's a morally shitty thing to do. You know what else is a morally shitty thing to do? Get into a club for free while men have to pay and then trick men into buying you drinks under the guise of trading that free drink for an oppurtunity at seduction, or take advantage of a female only scholarship because you were born with a vagina. What goes around, comes around. 

I don't know where you get this idea that women are owed respect while women do not return the favour by respecting men. TRP doesn't respect women because women do not respect men. In fact, TRP exists as a backlash/revenge movement on behalf of beta males who are systematically attacked, hurt, and taken advantage of by women. 

&gt;Women are the scapegoat, according to TRP.

No. Women are the direct cause. A scapegoat is something a movement uses to guise their true intentions. 

&gt;Appearance wouldn't be a factor for me, and I'm being completely honest. My key decision maker would be their age. I'd save the younger guy. Though this is a stupid analogy.

They're the exact same age...

&gt;Well, it depends on what you mean. I will be a little nicer and I'll flirt with a guy I'm attracted to.

So you believe in value. Good. I'm glad we've established that. 

&gt;In some ways, yes. If I'm attracted to a guy, I want him to also be attracted to me. If I'm not attracted to him, it doesn't matter.

So you believe in value. Good. Im glad we've established that twice.

&gt;I don't deny that the benefits outweigh the detriments. However, there are still some detriments.

1 detriment is insignificant in the face of supreme benefit. 

&gt;And I really don't know how the hell you thought I was insulting cashiers and waiters with that comment. If you are trying to call me a snob, you couldn't be further from the truth. My point is, I get tired of being asked out everywhere I go. It makes things very awkward. It's kind of embarrassing to be standing in line, in front of everyone, and have a complete stranger ask you out. Or, when the person preparing your food asks you out, and you say yes only because you don't want someone spitting on your burger and ejaculating in your soup.
If it was a cashier or a waiter I saw several times, and we became friendly, then I wouldn't mind being asked out. But the first time we meet, or when I'm clearly busy, that's not a good time.

Yea....my Ferrari sucks. It's totally the wrong paint job, and it's just unusable. I mean...how can I roll into my country club with a bright yellow luxury Italian sports car when all the other privileged people have sexy black luxury Italian sports cars? I mean....seriously....I'll have to get my 14th personal immagrant butler to ship it back for me.

Fucking obnoxious....

I tend to think that intolerant, ignorant, stupid people like yourself shouldn't be able to vote. Here--I'll explain myself like you've failed to do: 

Lets take it by attribute.

Intolerant people tend to be selfish. They tend to not be able to identify with people who aren't like them. In a world full of diverse sentience they'll make short-sighted decisions that benefit people like them in the short term while causing chaos and harm down the line. Racists allowed slavery to continue for a long time, once it ended, they oppressed their former slaves. Society still has not recovered from this. It hurts us economically. It damaged our educational system, it's made the political rifts in society worse. There is still distrust between black people and white people. Our lives are all worse because of their idiocy.

Ignorant people just don't know anything. They have no information with which to make decisions. Because of this, their votes are decided by random chance (where they were born, who their parents are, who their friends are, what their associates say, etc..).

Stupid people can't make decisions even if they have the information they need to make the right decision. They can't follow arguments, they're prone to logical fallacies, they're easily swayed by unscrupulous people.

You're all three. Why do you deserve rights? AI probably won't be stupid, it probably won't be ignorant. It might be intolerant, but I feel like how we treat it will impact the third modifier quite a bit. It deserves rights more than you do.

Can play pretty much any current game on highest settings at 1080p according to game debate.  Though you will want more RAM if you're going to play Skyrim on high and have 500 tabs in Firefox open at the same time.

You can get an HD5450 which can play most games at medium 720p for TEN DOLLARS right now, throw in a $40 CPU and you save a net $90 for a total of... $215.  You can even get a mobo that supports crossfire and buy a second 5450."

JustRuss79,AskMen,1389478778.0,"Typically?  I have seen, and know I have been a part of, complete detachment from her as anything but a coworker.

I do not speak to her unless directly work related. I do not engage in conversation even if she initiates it (other than to excuse myself if it drifts away from work). I stay away from her work area if at all possible. She never gets invited to lunch or after work functions (unless they are work functions for all employees).

Basically,  a woman this on edge becomes social poison. No guy will interact with her if they have a choice. She has isolated herself, so we let her be isolated.

It isn't worth trying to interact with her, when the slightest misstep or comment can be taken wrong and escalated.  Other women end up shying away from her as well because they LIKE interacting with their male coworkers on more than just a professional level.

My coworkers are some of my best friends;  except that one woman none of us can stand.  She doesn't understand why she keeps getting passed over for leadership positions and everyone is expecting her to go to our second line manager or the Director, complaining that her being passed over is sexist."

NatashaRomanof,AskWomen,1389478830.0,"I really like it, it's one of my favorite new shows of the 2013-2014 tv season! The overall plot is a lot of monster-of-the-week type stuff, since it is a genre show, but even though I'm not typically into supernatural stuff/demons type of mythology, I am enjoying it a lot. The characters are really wonderfully fleshed out, well-written and acted, and the interactions and relationships are really nice. 

The best relationship is between the main duo of Ichabod Crane and Abbie Mills. Ichabod is from 250 years ago in the past and they do make him probably more liberal-minded than any white man was from back then, they still confront right away the fact he's from a different time period and working with a black woman. (Ichabod: ""If you are insinuating I endorse slavery, I am offended."" Abbie: ""Wait, back up, *you're* offended?"") They work together and become partners, as is the standard trope for this type of show, but their chemistry is really great. Sometimes shows have to force that and they don't need to force anything here.

There is also a great developing story of Abbie and her estranged sister, Jenny. Sister relationships are not something that a lot of genre tv does (two women? talking to each other? about things other than men? be still my heart!) so I'm enjoying that progressing relationship. There's also Abbie's boss, Frank Irving, played by Orlando Jones. Irving is getting his own storyline with an ex-wife and a disabled daughter, and the show is exploring his backstory a lot now. Other secondary characters include Luke Morales, another detective who is Abbie's ex, and detective Andy Brooks, played by John Cho, who is not a regular but is still an important character. 

The one character who I think is being treated pretty poorly by the narrative is Katrina Crane, Ichabod's (dead) wife, but who still exists in this netherworld-purgatory-land (oh that's not confusing sounding haha), and also shows up in flashbacks. She doesn't get much of a personality other than being the woman Ichabod loves a whole lot, but I find it amusing and ironic that the least fleshed out character in the whole show is the show's only white woman, lol. It's kind of a refreshing change, in a way? 

Anyway long story short the cast is very diverse with only one white man and one white woman as part of the regular cast. Story-wise, there's perhaps nothing particularly remarkable about Sleepy Hollow, it is a monster of the week show after all, but as a longtime fan of genre shows, I can say I've never watched a show with this diverse of a cast that wasn't a regular drama like The Wire. Scifi and fantasy shows are my usual jam, and I can't think of any other show in those genres that isn't almost entirely white. I think Sleepy Hollow is a big step forward for tv in general, and genre tv in particular.

Oops, that ended up a novel, sorry! I just really love the show and want everyone to watch it."

3rd wildcard records for 2002-2013:

11-5: 1

10-6: 6 (and 10-6 still would have missed twice even with an extra wildcard)

9-7: 11

8-8: 6


Typically, if there's a 10-6 team that would make it in one conference, there would be an 8-8 team in the other conference that also made it. Which is worse? A .500 team making the playoffs or a 10-6 team missing? Also turns out there's an equivalent number of teams that would make it as 8-8 teams (and two 10-6s still missing) over the past 11 years."

We used to take Orion all the time as well when he was a puppy but since we moved to a new area we've had a couple of bad experiences at the new dog park so we stopped going. First our puppy Elune got attacked by another dog because she fetched the ball that dog's owner threw and this dog really didn't like that so he pounced her. She needed stitches on her eyelid. Luckily the owners of the dog which attacked her were decent people so they covered her vet bill. 

Then when we took our boy to the park the other week there were two wolf hybrids there who wouldn't stop bullying him. All Orion wanted to do was play with the other dogs and the two wolf hybrids just kept chasing him and growling at him, finally they had a scuffle, luckily no one got seriously hurt but that was it for us as far as that dog park goes..."

It's not like TV is overflowing with queer representation. If there were a lot of nuanced queer characters on TV, then I'd be more okay with this show. But there aren't and instead this show gets to capitalize on queer experience without actually giving queer characters a voice.

JonWood007,changemyview,1389479179.0,"It has nothing to do with being pissed at the woman, it's that the woman has A LOT more choice in the matter than men do. And let's face it, sometimes men get intentionally trapped into having a kid. Happens especially when a baby crazy 30something year old woman is involved. 

I guess my argument comes down to how proportional the choice is. In practice we're really not talking a 50-50 proposition. It's really a 90-10 or something proposition. Heck, if you wanna count the amount of time involved into making such a decision, assuming the act lasted 10 minutes, women have 20,160 (20 weeks X 7 days X24 hours X 6 10 minute intervals) times more time to make a decision compared to a man. And with a clearer head, too. That being said, it's actually like a 99.999-0.001 proposition, by this metric.

Sex might be a two way thing, but the act of bringing a child into the world is a much longer process, and the responsibility rests with the woman, not the man. Don't act like it's a 50-50 proposition."

(For those who don't know, there will be a patch for everyone to install with the paragon/loot 2.0 updates and AH closing, then the expanded content with the pack.) The changes to paragon leveling is so that each time you level you get a point to assign somewhere. But, from what I've seen (don't quote me on this, I've only watched a few of ZiggyD's videos of the expansion), it seems as if you can reset how you assigned the points. Wanna do quick runs?

EOverM,AskMen,1389479255.0,"Fair enough - that's not something I'd be able to do, really.  My feet are far too big to fit in there sideways.  It may well be the way to start a race, but I'm not planning on racing any time soon.

See, the handbrake over here is for when you're stopped, and ONLY then.  I understand it's referred to as the emergency brake in the States, but that's utterly against conventional wisdom in the UK.  You apply it if you're going to be stopped for more than a few seconds at a time, prepare the car for movement, then release it.  You shouldn't move when you release, is the idea.

This is the way anyone who goes through a proper driving school is taught in this country, and we don't have a habit of burning out clutches.  That suggests to me that you're being too sharp with the clutch, rather than that clutch control is bad for clutches - it is, but not for a fraction of a second at a time.

I'd actually disagree that it's easier to learn on a more powerful car.  It's much easier to practise, and polish your skills, but having a more sensitive clutch and a less sensitive accelerator is much more forgiving of mistakes, in my experience.  If you do make a mistake, you'll make it on the clutch, stall, and stop.  If you have it the other way around, you'll make a mistake on the accelerator, speed ahead and possibly crash.  Again, a matter of opinion, but honestly I think a lower power car is safer to learn on, and since it's more forgiving, it's also a little easier."

If you think making more money makes you a better person than other people then that would be a definite deal breaker.

I can also see difficulties if you spend way too much money on me where I can't keep up e.g. buying me stuff all the time, insisting on always paying for everything we do, taking me away on fancy trips all the time.

CalvinDehaze,movies,1389479323.0,"Sorry to break your heart, but this will never happen. You have to understand the mechanics of how a film is put together to know that unless you started it from the beginning, it would be next to impossible to accomplish this. For one, some VFX shots consist of multiple live-action elements, and each one is crucial in telling the story. Like comping two actors from two different takes, or even two different shoot days where they only got one actor at a time, into one shot. Or shots that are purely CG would be just black, since nothing was shot live-action for them.
  
Also, the pipeline doesn't allow it. Let's say you're on a big movie, in pre-production. You're storyboarding out the big VFX sequences with the director to determine what VFX is going to be needed. Sometimes you're doing pre-vis (rough 3d animated scenes) to map it out. Then you go to set, get your shots, then send them to the editor who puts together a rough cut and wants nothing more than to get rid of all green screens or unfinished shots from his cut, which is constantly changing. You would have to ask that editor to maintain a ""non-vfx"" cut of the movie on a different timeline. Though it is possible, no editor that I know of would ever do that, and even if we made the VFX editor do it, (which would be more work on an already stressed out back), the director and studio would never want to release anything raw, nor pay for the extra time and energy it would take to maintain a raw version of the cut."

Intigo,Guildwars2,1389479365.0,"Let's compare you to a damage-based Warrior (not Shouts):

* Your damage is lower. 

* Your survivability is lower.

* Unreliable Stability and very, very vulnerable when stunned without a Stunbreaker available. A Damage Warrior has 2 great Stability skills which makes it a lot easier to stay mobile and out of harms way when in the melee ball. A Warrior also has amazing -Condition Duration in Dogged March.

* On the plus side, you provide more Blasts for Fire/Water fields which gives out a decent amount of support.

Your Poison fields are okay, but in most instances they are either cleansed off the enemy quickly or your field may even end up being blasted instead of more valuable fields (Water/Fire).

The amount of pressure put out in a melee vs melee engagement among really **good** zergs will kill a Thief in most cases. If not, it is significantly more risky to run a Thief compared to a Warrior because of its squishy nature.

There is a reason very few guild groups run Thieves in larger raid-based WvW. The Thieves in [VII] gradually went towards other classes (Warrior / Mesmer) and Red Guard runs without any Thieves at all lately (as far as I know)."

atropinebase,todayilearned,1389479383.0,"The problem with the private care model, which I am intimately familiar with, is that just like ""managed healthcare costs"" in the insurance business doesn't mean ""maintaining the standard while reducing expenses"" but rather simply means ""refusing to pay for things"", you do not end up with a company that prioritizes professional care, cleanliness, or well maintained equipment. You end up hiring the lowest bidder. This leaves you with a company that hires as many inexperienced or less desirable employees as they can get away with, drives away most of the more experienced higher wage employees, and only cleans and maintains to the barest minimal allowable standard. And if you raise the standards, you raise your costs, which puts you back into the endless cycle. I certainly agree it would not be feasible for every little municipality to provide coverage, or even if they did, being able to provide appropriately trained and experienced staffing, which is why I'm a believer in county or state-based EMS agencies.

2) do you have a costum recovery on your phone?

i.e. Clockworkmod, TWRP(The Windows Recovery Project)


3)if not is your bootloader unlocked?



if you do have all the above, [you will download this zip file](http://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=2402764&amp;d=1384892279) and flash it through your costum recovery



after that download [this app from google playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viper.simunlockhelperfree) and follow the instructions there



if you don't have a costum recovery, and your bootloader is locked you can easily unlock your bootloader [in the official htcdev page](http://www.htcdev.com/bootloader/)


you will need [adb and fastboot](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1S0LCuXCnnmSWh6NGJmSE1BUWc/edit?usp=sharing)


follow instructions to unlock your bootloader, and once you are done with that you can flash [CWM Touch Recovery](http://download2.clockworkmod.com/recoveries/recovery-clockwork-touch-6.0.4.3-m7spr.img) just get your phone on fastboot mode and in your pc type in the following

     fastboot flash recovery *your-recovery-image-file.img*


and now you can get to your costum recovery by turning off your device and pressing *the power button* and the *volume up button*



&gt;bonus:

&gt;to get in *fastboot mode* you need to turn off your device and press *the power buton* and the *volume down button*

Wiskie,AskMen,1389479540.0,"Well, I think it's two-fold attraction, y'know?

On the one hand, some women are attracted to male physicians because because any physician is going to have, by default, some qualities that straight women find attractive. A doctor has to be smart, he has to be disciplined, he has to be confident, and he has to have control over himself and his surroundings to be good at his job. He has to make judgement calls that may be life or death. 

Ultimately, what I think it comes down to is this: Doctors are ""powerful."" Women are sexually attracted to powerful men on a very visceral level. 

*On the other hand,* women want security. Money is security. There's plenty of women who want nothing more than a secure lifestyle and would go after a guy's money and not the guy himself.

Parlay the qualities that make you a good doctor into the qualities that women are attracted to and you'll get what you want from your sexual relationships with them. If you don't *act* like a doctor (intelligent, confident, in-control) outside of the hospital then make no mistake, women will give you attention, but only for what's in your wallet."

True, but they're already invested in the currency. The value of dogecoin is based on speculation that it's going to be worth something, which depends somewhat on its popularity. The market is saturated with e-currencies right now, and the only real advantage dogecoin has is the free advertising the meme provides, but when doge becomes an ""old meme"", that could easily work against it, and you won't see as many new people getting into the market. Bitcoin's value is heavily bolstered by the fact that you can actually exchange it directly for goods and services, and I don't see dogecoin getting there.

I had a friend who was dating a Japanese woman, and her family basically said no, it wasn't going to happen. They didn't last much longer after that.

The only grief you get as a Western guy dating a Chinese woman is there's a stereotype of Western losers dating hot Chinese women. I occasionally feel this, as I didn't have that great a dating track record prior to going to China. On the other hand, it really comes down to how you feel in your own relationship. My wife's interests and talents are very complementary to mine, and we operate as equals. So if you as a couple feel happy, that's the main thing.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1389479992.0,"Men don't slut shame. 

Women slut shame other women. 

&gt;Why would a man care about a woman being a slut when he has no interest in being with her? Why bother insulting her just because she has many partners? Would you feel less respect for her as a person (remember, this is someone you have no interest in dating or being with)? 

Because it's a primal reaction. Women who sleep with a lot of men have no value because they do not leveridge their appearance on commitment. Is it logically accurate, maybe not...

I know for me, if I know a woman gets around, I have an inherent lowering of respect for her. 

&gt;Even if you feel more respect for a promiscuous man because it's harder for him to achieve, why would that necessarily lower your opinion of a woman who is the same? By that logic shouldn't you just not care?

No, because sexuality isn't analagous. For a man to get, lets say, 100 women, that takes serious effort, dedication, knowledge and skill. 

For a woman to get 100 partners, she just has to look nice, sit on a bar stool and wait for the meat parade. It takes no skill what-so-ever, no knowledge whatsoever, no effort whatsoever other than not being lazy and dressing well. Even overweight women have a drastically easier time attracting men that men do attracting desirable women.

&gt;Just an example, throughout my entire life I've had guys make up lies about having sex with me. I seriously, seriously doubt all of them even found me attractive. It happened in high school, college, even at certain jobs. Some of these guys I had never even spoken to. Granted I'm sure some of them lied about a lot of girls just to make themselves look good, but some of them seemed to want to spread rumors that I was a ""slut"" for no reason other than to bring me down. And it wasn't just me, it happened and still happens to other girls/women too.

That's not slut shaming; that's lying at your expense to improve their reputation. "

thedancingman4321,CarAV,1389480131.0,"Alright, I will clear this up a bit, now with science added! [This](http://www.doctronics.co.uk/images/sig_23.gif) is what a musical signal looks like. Those peaks and valleys are the amplitude of the signal. For that signal to exist, it needs to have a source and a ground. In a car the alternator charges the car with an AC signal converted to a DC one. This conversion is not perfect, so you get what is a ground loop in the car. Electrical noise. This noise trickles into the signal of the RCA cables. That is why when you turn the volume all the way you hear static. That electrical noise is always present, at a set level too. Lets just say .1v for this case. So for that 2v signal you saw earlier will have a little since wave along the t axis. In this case it will be very noticeable since it it 1/20th the total signal. Now lets say the signal is 5v. The electrical noise is 1/50th the total signal. The noise is less noticeable. Now, this is an extreme exaggeration. In most cars it is not very noticeable, if at all. It is say .001v or something like that. Having a lower or higher voltage on the signal makes an extremely small difference. 

tl;dr: 2v is fine unless you are going for a high-end sq setup.  "

1. 0055 - Sora (Valor-Form)
2. 0056 - Sora (Wisdom Form)
3. 0057 - Sora (Master-Form)
4. 0058 - Sora (Final-Form)
5. 0059 - Sora (Anti-Form)

(there are also separate digits for world forms, like Halloween Town and Space Paranoids)

No where within its digit list does Limit Form exist and it doesn't exist anywhere else in the game. 

In KH2FM, extra digits were added to blank spots for extra objects and characters to add to the Final Mix, ranging from 0923-09FC. Limit Form and its world versions exist in here, but won't work if you try and use it in regular KH2 because it doesn't exist in its data:

095D - Sora (Limit-Form) (Final Mix ONLY)

Point is, it's nowhere in the original KH2. If it was, it would exist in its digit range like the other forms. While it exists in Final Mix, its hex there wouldn't do anything in KH2 because nothing exists in that slot.

The reason this video is possible is because its model was inserted into the game."

You say bitcoins don't have backup. You know what else don't have any back up? Gold. People just decided to use it one day, as it was rare (just like cryptocurrencies, as they have a limited amount of supply). The only thing you really need is for people to accept its value.

I'd say that one of the main reasons currencies fail is because the government abuses it _ overprinting for example. That will not happen to bitcoins.

 * Point 2

I don't really understand your point here. Are you talking about hacking? If so, I cannot give you much technical insight, but I know cryptocurrencies are considered safe. About market manipulation? Well this can happen to anything on the market including government backed currencies. The US dollar and the Euro are stable currencies, but I know that in my country (Brazil), we got our share of market bubbles in the past.

 * Point 3

I think you overestimate the power of governments. For example, there are drug cartels and I'm sure the government would like them to go away. Also the fact that governments respond to several external lobbies, including people in the future who may have an interest on bitcoins."

RazTehWaz,AskReddit,1389480666.0,"This is a re-paste from a smilar thread somewhere else about a month back, but might be interesting for some people.

I was born deaf, after surgery around the age of 2 I regained some hearing, but still need hearing aids.
As I had no concept of speech during the most critical time for speech development, I learned how to think very differently. For the first 10 years or so (that I remember anyway) I thought mostly in pictures/images. Feeling thirsty made me think of a glass of water and so on.

I also sometimes think in very abstract concepts, which I've never been able to fully describe. I just get this feeling, different types of sensations, from all different parts of my body. Each area/different sensation is grouped to a category of things, so when presented with an experience that matches the category, I feel that sensation.
I could sit here for hours and try to explain what makes up a ""category"" but I honestly don't full understand it myself. I just feel it, and just add it to the list.

I'm 23 now, and have mostly switched to speech/language based thinking, though emotions are still very much tied in to images. I've also spent too long on the internet, as the images tend to be memes/reaction gifs.

I also find it very hard to describe my emotions/feelings as I just can't seem to translate things into language, so I'm not really able to communicate to others how I'm feeling."

I can see your point, though - now that I actually know how to do it, starting is much easier with a bit more kick behind the pedal.

Yeah, it's basically so you can relax your legs when you stop - you're supposed to take the car out of gear as well, but I find it easier just to keep the clutch down unless I'll be there for a few minutes.

I love both consoles but I play my 3DS more not because of some stupid focus or view or direction; THE 3DS JUST HAS MORE GAMES I WANT TO PLAY.

It's not fucking complicated, Nintendo puts a lot more gaming muscle behind its consoles which is what makes them successful. Whatever other points people want to agree/disagree on, there is no question that Nintendo makes some amazing fucking first party games and they sell systems.

To make the Vita more successful Sony needs to make more games unique to the system that are AMAZING. Tearaway is a perfect example, you get 2 or 3 more titles of similar quality and wonder and the system will sell like hotcakes.

Is everyone forgetting how the 3DS was deemed a FAILURE by most of the gaming media for quite a while? But now all of a sudden everyone is a fucking expert.

At the end of the day though, Sony is focused on winning the war of Xbox vs PS and I don't blame them on putting the focus there. "

MLG, who seriously FUCKED UP so hard and treated the entire sc2 community like shit during the whole dropping sc2 ordeal *months* ago is now getting their dick sucked over hosting a couple events, while its not even certain that they will keep sc2 around after MLG Anaheim.

Meanwhile, the same exact community is being *so fucking negative* about a renowned community figure giving quality content to the community at no expense to us. 

Why? 

Because he has been taking time to himself, getting married, enjoying the holidays and pursuing a new passion, all in a time where his expertise has no use during this tournament downtime.

Don't get me wrong, I am super excited to see MLG pick up sc2 again and am super optimistic about where it will go. Yes, MLG did fuck up, but here they are, giving the community content literally tailored to their audiences interest and ideas. All after a statement from sundance just as unprofessionally delivered as the 'twitter breakup' (again, I'm not complaining, just trying to put things into perspective).

I know that Artosis has also fucked up, not providing promised content to paying customers. But like MLG, he acknowledged his mistake, and attempted to right his wrong by hosting a webshow, something the community has expressed a heightened interest in as of late.

How can so many of us feel so entitled to artosis' unconditional commitment (which is ridiculous) to sc2 and we can't even appreciate him bringing back META, but *complain* instead? Especially when most of the people who are complaining have likely done *nothing* to better the scene as a whole. It's no wonder to why our sc2 celebrities are exploring new things and taking time off from this bullshit.

People need to realize that certain figures/organizations will not be around forever. All this negativity doesn't motivate them stick around, and without artosis, SC2 would be a darker place."

NeonGreenTV,lewronggeneration,1389481366.0,"Dude, seriously. Do people think they're really stating anything new when they state this bullshit?

I hate restating this, but I feel that I need to combat this shit because I fear a place where defeners have any sort of influence. But...

I'm 24, and when I was a kid shit was just as worse as it is now with kids. Actually, it's not different. Just back then, we lacked the internet and easily obtainable high tech gadgets. The 90s was the kick up period for the internet, I turned 9 in 1998 and I think we got internet in 1998 or 1999. Obviously not as advance as todays net, and I hardly used it because of that fact.

But man, I remember kids who were too grown for their time. There were always kids who wanted to be adults, do adult things, did their best grown person impression. They wanted pagers, and cellphones. That's all we had that was high-tech ""adult tech"". In the 90s (and I'm not being an 90s defener) the only high tech things there were that kids wanted and were geared towards kids, were game systems and maybe toys, In the 90s a lot of primitive versions of what we have today existed, and hardly any of that shit worked.

But back then people complained about grown children, sexualized children, children cursing, and skimpy young girls. This is nothing new. 

The thing I hate most about defeners is that they seen to gloss over the fact that this isn't 10, 15, or 20 years ago and that shit changed because well... shit changed. Every subsequent generation of children got more freedoms because the world moves towards more liberal shit. When I was a kid/teen, we were told the same shit, this was a problem in my generation too. Why did kids need cellphones? Why were kids out pass curfew? Why did we need VCRs and our own TVs?
It reminds me of how every new technology becomes the devil. When TV came out it was deemed bad and it made you stupid. Video games came next, and they were supposed to make us stupid and violent. The new devil? The internet, the gadgets that connect kids to the internet, and the social networks. See what I'm getting at here?

It especially pisses me off when I'm 24, and a lot of people of my generation have taken on this tone of a 60 year old. These people sicken me because it seems to me that they just do this shit to kiss the asses of older people because of the shit they were given as teens. And believe me, I heard a lot of stuff about my generation from older people when I was a child/teen. Everyone wants their chance at the ranks, and will sit around and shit on the next generation just so they can see like elders. It's like dude... I'm young. I'm not this 40 year old person living my life in a bore with a body breaking down. I'm only 7 or 8 years out of high school.

Like I was on facebook the other day and one of my old high school friends were talking about how people cause drama on social networks, and it turned into some 'kids these days' bullshit. And I had to step in and talk about how it was the same shit in the Myspace era. 

It bewilders me as to how people can be so young and be revisioning the past already. Like the 90s/early 00s were these very innocent times. Which they weren't. "

It's probably not been released on Xboc or PC but it's worth looking into, because it has sprites rather than 3D models it's aged better than FFVII-FFIX.

If you do get one of the Final Fantasy's on Steam (I think VII and VIII are on there now?) I've heard they used the original PC soundtracks which were not as good as the PS1 tracks, but that it's easily fixable with a mod.

As for picking between FFVII, FFVIII and FFIX (I reckon they'll release the last one sooner or later) it's largely a matter of preference and there's been a thousand threads on forums across the internet over which was better. I liked FFVIII, but others hated it. Best bet is to google them, maybe read a few reviews/trailers and see which interests you the most."

Unlike a man, you won't have any physical feedback about whether what you're doing is natural/comfortable for your lady.  You won't be able to feel if you're hitting her in an awkward way.

I don't want to discourage you from trying one at all, but I do want to warn you that you probably need to tell your partner that this is your first time fucking someone with a strap-on.  She'll need to be extra-communicative about what is and isn't working in order for you to get an idea of whether or not what you're doing is both good and non-painful.  You might also want to do some research beforehand on how to strap-on fuck someone.  If you scroll down near the bottom of the page on [this comic](http://www.ohjoysextoy.com/lebutch/) there's a 3-part explicit strap-on tutorial you may find helpful.

And it was also in  the manner in which he done it. He had recently been asked whether he'd thought about leaving, and said he hadn't given it any thought. Which is understandable.

I still play a lot of games, but not the same way I used to play them. Used to be I'd go out and buy a random playstation game and just play it for ten hours straight regardless of quality.

Four or five years ago I bought a ps3 thinking I'd do the same thing. Get random games, play them, have fun.

Only, every time I shopped I'd be like, ""Nope, nope, nope. No this doesn't look good. No I can't see myself ever playing this. You know, I don't think any of these games are really made or marketed towards me anymore.""

I haven't touched any of the latest Final Fantasies. Mario is completely lost to me. I thought the new Donkey Kong looked kind of neat but it was on the Wii. I can't relate to *any* of the Call of Duties. I played Modern Warfare single player on the computer and it was pretty neat, but I can't see myself playing it over and over and over again.



Instead I find any free 'gaming' time made up of playing small indieish games like Kerbal Space Program or Faster Than Light or...You know, I can't even really think of other examples, I haven't played any in so long.

I'm not sure I bought or played a single new game in 2013, I know absolutely nothing about xBox one or Ps4 and don't intend to get either, I'm not excited for *any* upcoming releases, and most of my free time lately is spent tinkering with electronics or playing with my 19 month old son.

...Oh yeah, that probably explains it.


And yet somehow, I still think of myself as a gamer. Maybe some day 10 years from now my son will be rocking out the Playstation 5* and I'll be sitting there watching and saying things like, ""Playstation, eh? You know I used to be pretty damn good at Mario...Think I could give that a try?"" and he'll be like, ""What the heck is Mario, Dad? Go away, you're embarrassing me! You don't even know how to hold the TurboXcontroller.""

*(I was going to say PSX5000 but then I realized that in ten years, it's more likely to just be 'the next generation')

That being said, I wasn't just shoved out into the world with absolutely no skills what so ever. I went through independent living skills, learned how to deal with things like finaces and other ""adult real world"" skills I would need to be successful. 

I moved out of my foster home the day I graduated high school. I stayed with my best friend for four days, then moved to the city I would be going to college in with my boyfriend. 

Because I was a foster kid who phased out and I went to collage, essentially my entire first year of college was paid for through grants and scholarships by the state. 

I remained close to my foster family and continued to have the emotional support they provided after I left, though both have since died. 

My first year in the real world went pretty good. I am pretty sure I was more well off and prepared for adulthood than most of my peers actually, because the county I lived in did a good job making sure that I had a strong foundation, something I personally think that plenty of ""normal"" kids don't seem to actually be given.

By the way neither game has any actual objective way to win them or even an agreed upon scoring system. 

now the same developer makes both these games and a lot of people noticed that while game A and game B both have lots of different features game A seems more polished and crashes less and there are less bugs that can corrupt save files. and it turns out that the majority of the development team can only play version A of the game which makes it really hard to fix bugs in version B of the game. now everyone agrees it's probably a good idea to get more people who can play version B of the game into the development team and the company is recruiting more people from the B camp but it can take years for the influx of new hires to equal out the A:B ratio and even then who knows how long it will take before the quality of game B reaches the quality of game A.

However what doesn't help is blaming everyone who plays game A for the state of game B. People with no connection to the development team. And claiming that people who play game A's accomplishments are somehow lesser because they didn't have to deal with as many bugs only alienates people who play game A and makes them care less about fixing game B."

---

Religious circumcision should be out-right banned. Medicinal, or Cosmetic circumcision should be heavily regulated...

A parent **should not** be able to approach their doctor and ask for their child to be circumcised.

The doctor **must** find a valid medical reason, to preform the surgery on a minor, and suggest it as a course of treatment **before** it becomes an option.

A **non-minor** (A consenting adult, consenting only to the manipulation of their own body) **should** be able to approach their doctor and seek circumcision as a cosmetic procedure after the age of 16/18/21."

I would be very careful about assuming you know what a victim needs better than the victim does.

I'm a heterosexual woman. I had a very rough relationship a few years ago, and it got scary after a breakup; we had a fight (due to him trying to push sex on me that I didn't want, since we'd broken up), and he physically tackled me down to the ground, held me there, and told me he wanted to strangle me. After a struggle, he finally let me go, and you know who I went to? My mom and my dad. My dad in particular made me feel safe, because he's strong.

If I hadn't had that option, I would have preferred to go to a shelter with both men and women—not *just* women—because I felt the intense desire to be near someone(s) who had the physical strength to guard me from my ex if he came after me. 

I realize that this is irrational. It's a shelter; it's not like there isn't security. They could call the police. But for psychological reasons, I felt a *very* deep need to have a friendly man in sight, because their physical strength made me feel safer."

It could be a dialogue thing as you said, I saw her as a tough girl who was trying to hide her affection for Legolas (because it wasn't allowed) but still being a formidable elf and a great shot. This could also be because I've read some of the Tolkien books, and afaik it's pretty normal for guys and girls to be equal in this way in the elves. She didn't act 'like a girl' because in their society there wasn't really a difference in that sense of behaviour.

steadymotion,asktrp,1389482519.0,"Try meditation. Meditation helps you to be unreactive. That's your problem, you're reacting to things. When I'm sitting in a chair and someone sneaks up behind me and touches my shoulder, I don't even move a muscle. I simply continue looking in the direction I was looking and say, ""Hello."" without even knowing who I'm talking to. I can do this because I've trained myself not to react to things immediately (although I can change this if there's a seriously dangerous situation). Meditation helps me, and it might help you.

Another thing to be aware of is your vision. Notice how when something happens, your eyes automatically turn to look at it? Try not doing that. Try just looking in one direction, and letting things happen all around you without letting your eyes shift to look at them. When you do want to look at something, turn your head SLOWLY or move your eyes SLOWLY to look at it (unless it's a real threat). Don't be in such a hurry to give things your attention. A lot of it is just useless noise. You're calm in the midst of a raging storm. You are unphased by everything, and you only react to things when you choose to, after having thought about them and decided on the best course of action.

&gt;people tell me that I'm giving off a  ""creepy serial killer vibe"".

Doesn't matter what people think of you. Make a joke out of it, ""you've revealed my secret. now I have to kill you."" Behave how you want to behave.

Dsf192,army,1389482588.0,"Also...transferring (or reclassing) is not just a quick transfer if you don't like your job.  If I remember correctly, you have to complete half of your contract at the MOS you're currently primary in.  Then once you do that you can put in a request to change MOSs (say going from 11B to 89D).  Which would mean extending your contract to meet the training requirements and whatever minimum obligation requirements (if any) the Army puts in front of you.

The process would be different going from the enlisted to the officer side of the house.

As far as going EOD, if that's what you want to do go for it.  Just realize that:

A. The school can be pretty difficult and if you fail out you could be force reclassed to something else.  So if you're 11 months into training, and fail, they might send you to 35F school (we had a few EOD failures in our class) for another 4 months.  Or some other school for any other length of training.  Or if you fail out early enough, they could chapter you.

B. The war is drawing down, so chances of deploying and actually doing your job will continue to go down.  Especially with such long training.  But that's the same with a lot of MOSs.

It might be easier on you to just try and commission, but I don't know how that process works."

""Genuine"" is a broad concept. It means being honest about what you want, and that can be off putting sometimes, but you have to do it, or else you end up in situations you don't really want to be in. But it also means being ""real,"" or basically ending all your manipulative or approval seeking behavior. Buying stuff for girls in the hope that you'll impress them or that they'll ""owe"" you is one example. One that I've struggled with is being too funny - when I try to use humor to impress a girl, I'm not being genuine, because I'm essentially trying to win the girl over by being something other than myself.    

But I don't think genuine means saying everything that comes to your mind, at least not if it's negative or insulting to the girl. That goes against Rule 3: Be likeable. "

asoiaflover,confession,1389482845.0,"I don't think there is anything wrong with you at all. ALL of us have our preferences. My particular fetish is much worse than yours, objectively. 

It's natural to find pregnant women erotic, I believe. I think it's an evolutionary response, so that when a male impregnates a female he just doesn't take off. Since you are into women, it would make sense that you would find something so utterly female like pregnancy to be erotic. And come on, it's hot. They get big breasts, and curvy bodies, and a wonderful glow. And there's something inherently feminine and sexual about a woman's body carrying new life.

I was counting crayfish burrows and packing up for the day, about to leave my site and return to my car.  My car is about 200 yards away and uphill and I'm carrying about 40 pounds of equipment with me.

So, as I'm lugging my equipment, I hear a loud frantic chirpping.  Thinking a squirrel pissed off a bird, I kept going.  But, all of a sudden I hear a huge *thud* in a tree right off to my left.  I freeze.  There's a huge pissed off turkey hen bee-lining it right for me screaming and hooting at me.  I couldn't drop my equipment because it was expensive.  So, I readied my big boot and thought, if Duke Nukem could save the world with his foot, so can I kill a crazy turkey.  

She's running at me full tilt, I gulp.  Ready to kick her hard, she suddenly twists left and runs off behind me.  She's running hard into the woods.  I took that opportunity to sprint ahead to my car and up to the hill.  I slowed down and caught my breath.  But, before I could breathe a sigh of relief, there's that fucking turkey coming back for more.  This time, it sounded even more pissed off.  And she's running even faster towards me.  So I said, fuck this, sprinted up the hill, and threw everything in my car and drove away as fast as I could.  

My boss made fun of me for the rest of my time in college and called me ""turkey neck"" as a beloved nickname.

But no matter how you look at it, an eco-vegans diet &gt; eco-omni diet
and a non-eco vegan diet &gt; non-eco omni diet.

It is not hunters versus walmart vegan.  The fair comparison is a hunter versus a forager.

98% of all meat comes from factory farms.  There is no way to support eco-friendly meat eating on any realistic scale.

Makes everyone happy (except those who fancy their nice looking apps more than actual, properly working software, but since OP seems to be more into network programming and is using C, I guess they'll create command line programs most of the time anyway)

Good luck!"

It was then that I truly realized that I don't want him in my life, due to the fact that for a whole month in which we had semi-regular contact planning, he failed to inform me that my uncle passed away due to cancer. He didn't even tell me, my stepmother did. I told him then and there not to contact me until he considers me a part of the family again, and I haven't heard a word from him.

Sorry to go off on my own tangent, but your father sounds eerily similar to mine, so i hoped that this may help in some way.

Sexual attractions are not inherently objectifying. How you treat the object of your desires are. Think about it.

Ideally, they would offer a variety of different rooms (e.g., single rooms, two-person rooms, four-person rooms), and victims could be sorted into different rooms according to their needs. They absolutely should not discriminate against certain victims, however; everyone who needs entrance should be welcome.

If someone freaks out when they notice someone with red hair out of the corner of their eye because, for a second, it look like their abusive mother—then yeah, don't house them with redheads. If someone feels unsafe in the company of black people because their abusive ex is black—even if the victim herself or himself is black!—then don't room them with black people. If someone is freaked out by tattoos, a certain kind of hairdo, a particular dialect, or *anything* else, the shelter should seek to minimize their discomfort, at least in the short-term while the victim is particularly jumpy.

I was in an abusive relationship years ago and, of all things, it was a certain make of *car* that made me scared!

If the phobia doesn't wear off within a few days, then obviously therapy is called for. But in the meantime, house them according to their immediate needs. If they don't feel safe in the shelter, they will leave the shelter and risk returning to their abuser or simply ending up on the streets.  "

That probably contributes to your sense of being lost.

Instead, if you force yourself to be bold, you'll probably end up churning out a bit of crap at the beginning - but you'll improve much quicker, and find yourself producing great work in no time.

Push your colours, try using more vivid and saturated tones. Sometimes when my work ends up too pale and faded, I'll copy everything, paste it into a new layer and set that to multiply or overlay, or I'll play with adjustment layers (specifically color balance, sometimes hue and saturation).

Hurricane043,explainlikeimfive,1389483442.0,"Throughout the development of programming languages, various different ways to represent concepts have been explored. 

One of the relatively newer ways is object oriented programming. The general idea behind OOP is that you represent concepts as something called an object. An object can have data fields and methods (aka functions, if you are familiar with other languages) associated with them. 

I think it's best to think of this in terms of an example.

Imagine you have a car. A car has a model name, a manufacturer, a year, etc. A car has to be represented by all these elements, but keeping track of multiple variables for one thing can be difficult. Instead, why not create one ""variable"", and then have the programming language associate other variables with it for you? Cars also perform all the same functions. A car can drive. A car will burn gas. And so on. Why not associate all these functions with that one ""variable""?

That is OOP.

I can create an object, a car. You can consider it a type that has variables and functions associated with it (types are actually objects themselves - a string, for example, can have it's length computed by a string method). Each car will have certain variables, such as it's name, manufactuer, and year. Each car will have functions that will drive the car, add gas, etc.

Now what if I want to create a garage to hold my cars? A garage can hold multiple cars. So I can create multiple car objects to represent each one. Now instead of having car1Name, car1Manufactuer, car2Name, car2Manufactuer, etc., variables to represent everything, I will just have car1, car2, and so on. This let's you organize everything much better.

Arguing with people like you on the internet, is more an exercise of positing a position to the audience who will be reading this, than it is for your benefit.

...As I previously stated, I would have more than willing to converse with you, had you been willing to converse with me. Instead, you chose to insult me via sarcastic condescension.

*smarm·y  [smahr-mee]* 

*adjective, smarm·i·er, smarm·i·est.*

cavalier2015,trees,1389483791.0,"I can't tell you if you should or should not start smoking. That is completely something you have to be comfortable with doing for yourself. 

I can tell you that I used to be morally against trees too. I never really thought less of people who smoked, but I told myself I never would smoke. I drank, so smoking seemed unnecessary. Well, I finally let one of my friends smoke me out...and it was an awful experience. Turns out the stuff we had had salvia mixed in. 

Despite that, several months later I tried again, and it was great. I felt relaxed, I had fun, and I felt great after. I noticed it would help me with my anxiety and minor depression, so I got a vaporizer and started smoking more.

Now I smoke quite often (several times a week) and I don't regret it at all. My grades have been better, my relationship with my parents is better, I'm calmer, more relaxed, and can keep my cool much better than before.

There have been times when getting high has come in the way of some responsibilities, but it was never anything major and those times have been far and few in between (things were worse with alcohol, especially with the hangover).

So again, it has to be something you're comfortable with. If you've decided you want to give it a try, ask a close friend, find a comfortable place and time, and have fun with the experience.

If it helps you at all, I'm a junior at a rather rigorous university majoring in biomedical engineering with an engineering business minor, in addition to being a premed student.

Using your example, since you don't know why she is in the hospital and she likely has other stuff on her mind, she probably wouldn't appreciate being hit on. If you were sitting next to her in the waiting room and made  small talk that's fine.

All people are different, some more sensitive than others, your goal shouldn't be to just ""get her"" but just be a friendly person and if it works out, it works out. People meet under different circumstances at different places but hitting on someone at a funeral or hospital, isn't the right time."
robinhoode,BitcoinSerious,1389483849.0,"&gt; They get upvotes because they use vocabulary words, but I really wish there were a way to illustrate to them how hilarious they sound to people who actually do have detailed knowledge of what they think they're talking about.

You do this via formal methods. When you have no formal framework for describing ideas, you get exactly the scenario you describe. 

Unfortunately, Bitcoin is such a new idea that there is no ""cryptocurrency fundamentals"" textbook or equivalent, like there is in almost every branch of mathematics. Perhaps there are technical reference points, but that is not the same as a guided walkthrough of the fundamental results that allowed Bitcoin to form.

If such a textbook did exist, I would be all over it and I would have no problem eating all the words I've used."

- canceling all deals (Regardless of how profitable or needed for the survival of your fort) because some part of some object (including a bin, or a all gold trinket) has some small piece of wood on it that you didn't notice.  
- Coming to your fort and negotiating with you how many trees you are allowed to cut down on your own property. Read that again. They are telling you (at the cost of war and bad relations) how many trees you're allowed to cut... on your own land.  
- They don't care in the least of those wooden trinkets are made out of the wood that THEY SOLD YOU. Doesn't matter. You're still a murderer.  
- They actually have in there ethics that it's OK to eat sentient beings (IE other elves, dwarves, humans) if they kill said people themselves.  
- They sell exotic pets... including animal people. If you buy them then to you they are citizens capable of anything including becoming mayor - but to them they are just... sort've... slaves.  
- They don't have nor sell metal.  
- Their weapons... all wood. Armor... allwood. Useless against goblins.  
- To attack, they ambush you. Then when your calvary come out they run away. Can't even figiht a real war.  
- All their conversations are arrogant like crazy. ""oh, we appreciate your ethical works"" and ""We're proud of you"" and such. 
- They don't have guards on their caravans, and they travel by foot. IE they're inefficient and really easy to slaughter and steal from. Which is tempting after they just told your starving fort to fuck off because you accidentally had that gem in a bin made of wood (elvish or otherwise).

And for all that they have exactly one thing to offer that isn't easily gotten elseware - exotic animals. You buy a few, bread them yourselves, and then you got a superior exotic animal collection. But when they ride into war on giant bears or giant flying eagles - that's kind've impressive. It'shard to fight hoards of giant siege creatures.

ashwinmudigonda,TrueFilm,1389484332.0,"Alright got done with it last night (been watching it for a couple of weeks via Netflix DVD, actually). I don't think I like it. For one, I am absolutely annoyed with the casting. Fat Morpheus doesn't fit the role, and the schizo Will seems so tormented all the time, it came off as affected. The three side-kicks who perform autopsies were the worst actors that I've ever seen with some of the lamest lines ever written. Alana Bloom's character wanted me to punch her in the face, as did that Korean autopsy lady's. All-in-all, the entire cast was mediocre-horrendous.

Now, the story...clearly the writers wanted to leave S1 in a cliffhanger and they went through a circuitous route to set it up. By the last episode, I was just waiting for closure - Hannibal is caught, Will is free of his demons, and I don't have to suffer S2. But, no, they kept twisting it on and on until all the victim names and their purported murderers blended into one abomination that I couldn't keep track of.

Finally, Will is blessed with pure empathy. WTF does that mean? Most of the times, it appears Fat Morpheus could not perform basic detective work, and required Schizo Will to come in, tremble and cry, and then say, ""The knife in the chest means the killer stabbed the victim."" I got tired of this faux-Sherlock pretty quickly, but now I need to suffer S2 to know if Hannibal will be caught or not.

The giant stag got quickly tiring, and the entire gray filter and shuttling to and fro to MN was annoying.

There was genuine terror in the penultimate episode with the lady with Cotard's Syndrome (where she thinks she is dead), especially, when Will finds her under his bed, and when she visits him after she dies.

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389484336.0,"I'm actually not feeling well today so my points will be brief. 

You're confusing omnipotence with omniscience. If the Buddha was omnipotent and could defy karma by just explaining to every single person needed to run it about building a nuclear power plant, we would all be Buddhas, since leading all beings to enlightenment is a much better use of his time. Sometimes it only took a few sentences to communicate the dharma to someone; not so with nuclear fusion.

In the same discourse that the Buddha said he was not a god, he also said he was not a human being. I'm not saying the Buddha is a god because *even gods die*.

The Buddha's omniscience does *not* imply power *over* reality as much as it is being outside of samsara with it's rules and limitations. Again, the former would be omnipotence, which I believe you have confused my point with.

That is the entire point

No one said this either.  But it is better.

*My failure to imagine* oh, come on now.  I am sorry, but I am not basing reality on my imagination.  Please do some research.

just explain EVERYTHING to them. my throat hurt at the end of my shift because i wasnt used to talking so much! haha. try to let them do as much hands on stuff as possible (with close supervision). quiz them. if they are giving meds, ask them questions about them so they understand what the med is, why theyre giving it, and what to look out for as far as adverse effects. ask them questions and teach them about patient's diagnoses and general interventions that are done for that type of patient and why. 

the first night i just let him shadow me and showed him where everything was, the codes to different rooms, etc and let him pass a few meds (mainly IVPB, IVP because he didnt have much experience with them).

be patient with them. you dont realize how quick you become at things that seem so routine to you (charting, cleaning up a patient, hanging an antibiotic, doing a head to toe assessment), a lot of it is brand new and it can take them double the amount of time to do it correctly.

good luck! precepting students has given me a lot of confidence.

You know more about the hardware than myself, but you're you have demonstrated poor reading comprehension (okay I've done it too) and it's compounding and a little derailing.

Example:

&gt;Lol, so you think watts are determined by the model number?

Yes at face value what I said doesn't make sense, where as I'm actually replying to the context you keep bringing up which doesn't address what I'm trying to ask you. The point is, you are accusing me of claims I didn't make.

Now moving on to the good stuff:

---

&gt;Are you trying to say that going higher wattage on the model is wasted money because it will never get used?

&gt;Largely yes. If you spend more money for a higher wattage that you never utilize then yes you're wasting money. The kicker is that efficiency ratings are tied to load% but that's getting kind've advanced (although if you want we can go there).

&gt;Yes. Once your over the wattage requirement of the system then wattage means absolutely nothing. It doesn't matter if your supply can put out another 50 watts or another 500 watts. IT HAS NO BEARING on the anything.

&gt;A computer that requires 400 watts will run just as happy on a 450w as it will on a 750w. Neither one of them will fail. However if the 450w is gold and the 750w is bronze, then the 750 will just be inefficient (and likely supply a dirtier voltage). If they do fail though that's it's for reason outside there wattage specification. Or in other words, WATTAGE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

**Those are the replies I was looking for since this started :D ^ And YES I'd like if you went into detail**

---

&gt;You're gripe was that people pay for 500w psu when they can get 750w for slightly more...wasn't it?

500w vs **600w**, you were the first to bring up 750w I believe. The original idea was that if the 500w was cheap, then going *one* step up would make the 600w more reliable with less chance of failure, a straw-man for getting better quality in the first place. They are mostly the same, but the transformer etc may differ so I was presuming that the heavier model may last longer. This is moot at this point but I'd appreciate elaboration.

More so my emphasis was regarding people who flame others over the small details.


**G2g, didn't finish**

EDIT:

Anyways it's at the point where the argument becomes arbitrary because the right course of action becomes clear on what should be purchased in the first place to avoid the majority of arguments, but there's always someone who will come up with something to complain about.

*Regardless I value what you could teach me, and I wish this discussion began better because I'm used to dealing with people who have no expertise in electronics trying to argue one way or another; (or examples like R_K_M below who make a mistake and start a new argument to save face instead of admitting what they did)  quite often it ends up with the other person getting their pride hurt and holding a grudge against me when the quality of their argument is even lower than I can offer.*

Regardless, I fold, but I do want a more elaborate explanation. Be mindful of what you say, because I may refer to it in the future, then suddenly I'm in a whole new pointless argument because everyone has an opinion."

I don't know if that's your situation but if your dentist has warned that your teeth may get worse if you don't fix it now, definitely take that into consideration.) So I guess what I'm saying is it depends whether you will be happy in the long run with un-corrected teeth.

In the Japanese system inmates on death row wait, simply wait, day after day, knowing that every morning, this could be the day they die. For years. The family is informed only after the execution is carried out, making goodbyes virtually impossible.

I take your point if Japanese capital punishment is meted out to a higher standard of evidence, and I don't know enough to contest that, but I have heard very questionable things about Japanese interrogation rooms.

If they are the *most* supportable, perhaps there's something irreconcilable between capital punishment and a progressive judiciary. Who studies things like this? Like a criminology review? It's a really interesting question."

Skwonky,short,1389484936.0,"Muscles work on lever mechanics. For tall lifters most exercises mean the weighted load is father from the fulcrum and muscle insertion (where the effort force is). 

Take this picture of a class 3 lever: http://www.ohio.edu/people/williar4/html../HapEd/NASA/SimpMach/cl3lever.gif

Now imagine that represents the forearm during a curl, the load is the weight held in the hands, the effort is the biceps muscle insertion to the lower arm, and the fulcrum is the elbow. The farther away that load is the more force is required to lift it.

Edit: Fun fact, chimpanzees are so incredibly strong for their size because their bicep insertion (effort force) is farther away from their elbow (fulcrum), meaning a more advantageous lever mechanic.

If you are smart enough to use a common CDN for delivering these artifacts, your user might not even have to download them, but still get the functionality for free!

What you do have with your super-special framework is something you have to teach other people (You can hire angular and ember devs off the street), and you have to maintain the technical ""purity"" of the framework. Every time you need a new feature, you need to build the framework and the app, instead of being able to build upon work by others. 

If learning something with ""147"" entries is too hard for you, why are you programming in the first place? functions, classes, variables, scoping, prototyping, inheritance, arrays, lists, maps, ... how do you cope?! Or do you just suck it up and learn it, and then be more productive?

Didn't set a time in Quali because there was too much traffic to set a time for my first few laps, and I ran wide in the 2nd Lezmo on both of my other 2 hot-laps

Thankfully this meant I didn't have to start at the front of the notoriously chaotic Turn 1, which to my benefit lived up to the hype. All I had to do was stay back for the first 2 turns and I was up from 14th to 9th after the first lap.

I'm happy with my consistency, especially compared to last week. I had a great duel with Pseudo for about 5 laps, with both of us pitting at the same time. Spectre came out of nowhere after that, and I spent the rest of the race trying to keep him out of my DRS range, which definitely went better at some points than others (damn gravel traps).

I'd be curious to hear from other people what kind of strategies they were running, it seems like I had quite an advantage just by being on a 2 stop, which I decided on after talking to Nemesis before the race with him telling me how badly the 3 stop went for him.

One difference would be playing 2 fewer games outside of the division since the re-alignment. I'm not saying it would positively or negatively affect the distribution of wins. I'm saying statistically, including that data would change the results and it's not good science. I'm not going to look up the records for the past but you could easily make a case for there being more parity in divisional games because you play the same team twice per year. That's my point.

He came running out of his little cramped store and said he'd charge me no tax, making it $70 even. I kept walking, and found another store with the Defender case for $49.99. I said ""cash price?"" and it was somehow $65 cash..

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1389485692.0,"Culture specific circumstances that aren't relevant to modern society. Unless there's some sort of economic collapse or global catastrophe that makes civilization more precarious, the current attitudes towards homosexuality will only grow stronger. Why? Education. Social conservatives want to curtail gay rights because A. they're ignorant about human society. They believe, for no reason, that being gay correlates with other behaviors that society doesn't like---weakness, violence, lack of responsibility, etc, and/or B. their interpretation of religion requires them to hold those views. 

Religion is dying, level of education is increasing. As long as those two trends continue homophobia will decrease."

AccipiterQ,gainit,1389485827.0,"Alright, I'll try and help.  

With regards to bulking, I've done both clean bulks and dirty bulks. During the summer of 2010 for instance I was 187 lbs. @ 10.5% bf. I wanted to see how huge/strong I could get. I had done bulks before and cuts, but wanted to see what my limits were. I ramped up to about 4000 calories per day for a couple weeks, and then up to 5000. If you look [here] (http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/2011/05/heres-my-current-cut.html), at the part in the screenshot labeled 'start' that was actually the first step of my cut after that bulk (I had replaced whole milk with the 2%).I went from 185 lbs. @ 10.5% to 231 @ 21% bf, in 6 months. My lifts exploded. My 1RM on benching went from 280 to 340, my squat went from 315 to 400, my deadlift from 405 to 475, my barbell row actually ended up at 320.  Of course I gained a lot of fat as well, there's progress pics on that log. Cutting afterward wasn't that hard, I took the steps you see in that link I posted. In retrospect I didn't need to step down so slowly, could've probably just done 3 of those steps. Anyway, I ended up at 193 @ [9.5% bf](http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/2011/09/september-12-2011-new-picture.html).

That was fun to do once in my life, but I wouldn't want to do it again. By the end of a real dirty bulk you're almost sobbing as you try and finish yet another 1/2 lbs. of PB.  Plus you gain a ton of fat. not good times.  Again, the gains were astounding, but still clean bulking is cheaper, more efficient, and offers better bang for your buck. The more conservative bulks that I undertook the last few years are nice because I stayed leaner, felt better, looked better, and still had some nice strength gains. It also makes cutting easier and quicker. 
You can see an example of one of my more conservative bulks [here](http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/2011/11/november-6-2011-bulk-beginning.html).  I have carbs focused mainly around workouts.  (The training day alternates never got used).  From that example I went from 183 before halloween (overdid it a bit trying to get shredded for Halloween), up to 206.5. I pulled over 500, got my bench back to 320, did a pullup with 100 lbs. added on, and started o-lifting.I Push Pressed, 255, and hanging power cleaned 225. I stayed MUCH leaner, in fact I still had about a 4 pack of abs at the end of the bulk, and someone noticed my ass actually looked 'svelter'. I think this was on account of the o-lifting.  I started cutting on April 1st, and ended up [here, at 195 lbs]( http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/2012/09/september-6-2012-upper-body.html).  So how to bulk smartly?
 
First understand the difference between raw amount of protein in your diet, and protein as a *percentage* of your diet.  The mistake I made for the first two months of my most recent bulk was that I was not raising my protein at all.  I figured since I was taking in more carbs, and more strategically that I could leave protein alone, and my body would use it more efficiently.  Nope.  Up the protein, but realize it will be a smaller *percentage* of your calories overall since fat &amp; carbs are going upt as well.  When you cut your protein drops some, but it's a greater *percentage* of your calories.  I actually got into a loop where I was upping it when I bulked, then being paranoid while cutting so upping it more, then needing to up it next bulk since I thought that number from my cut was my baseline.  Don't do this. OK, now to the nitty gritty. 

First figure out your goal weight &amp; bf %.  Let’s say it’s 200 lbs. @ 15% bf.  That leaves you with 170 lbs. of lean body mass.   Multiply that by about 21; less if you’re more reticent, more if you’re active.  The resulting number is your caloric goal, in this case 3570.   Now for macros, multiply that LBM number by 1.5, which gives you 255.   Set fat calories at 30%, which comes to 119g.  The remainder comes from carbs, 370g in this case.  Keep the carbohydrates largely centered around your workouts, and the mornings. Look at where they fall in my clean bulk diet plan I linked to in the previous paragraph.   Again, these are general numbers, if you gain weight/fat easily, lower that multiplier. If carbs cause you slather on the adipose tissue, then lower the calories from carbs by 10% and up the calories from fat by 10%. The routine is up to you, [here](http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/2012/06/june-14-2012-current-routine.html) is one I've used for both bulking &amp; cutting.  Of course modify things for your own goals; hypertrophy you're going to want to use higher reps, more power lower reps. 

I also wrote a brief guide [here](http://hurrrrrrrrr.blogspot.com/p/bulking-guide.html).  

Hope this helps some.  PM me if you need more aid.

When I say ""scientifically correct"" I mean methods based in science and dog behavior studies.They're based in the theories of B.F. Skinner, and use conditioning techniques (classical and/or operant). They're more scientific because they're based on the way we've found that dogs' brains work, and how they learn, instead of on vague ""pack leader"" and ""dominance"" ideas. Also, body language is very important. It's not conducive to training a dog when you categorize their various body postures into ""dominant"" or ""submissive."" It's not that simple. The dominance theory has been debunked, [in dogs](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/dominance-theory.html) and [in wolves](http://www.trainingyourdog.ca/articles/the-flawed-alpha-wolf-theory.html).

I am a web shopper by nature but I have to say one of the things I like about buying from Fluid is that they will tell you straight up what to expect from the stuff they build and make and sell. 

One of the annoying things is they sell out of everything right away :D The last time they got ohm readers in stock I was standing at the counter, a customer said ""ohm reader,"" and three people scrambled to buy one.

There were some models behind the counter today, so it might be a matter of putting them on the site- but if you are burning for one and call up there may be some, was the point of this whole post. But overall this vendor is so great to deal with, I go there weekly usually. 

I was bummed because they had bigger deck drippers for like 30 seconds when I went to the bathroom but I blinked and missed it. if I had a work area I'd love one of these because it looks a lot more fucking convenient than what I do right now, which is build over my keyboard or on a corner of the couch with all my shit in my lap."

Exis007,legaladvice,1389486089.0,"I was involved in being a placement home for foster kids for nine years. 

It doesn't even make sense that CPS would use money/resources to place a child with a foster home when an alternative is available. There isn't enough money, there aren't enough homes. Foster care is a last-resort alternative. 

That being said, if they pull the kids they might be in a state-run facility for such time as they need to interview/certify a family member placement. That is not tremendously uncommon. They might also go to an emergency foster home for a period of time but that's not a long-term situation either. 

Family placements, however, are tricky. They are usually denied because someone has too many kids already, the family member is unable or unwilling to provide a stable situation, or the family member is unable or unwilling to follow **the rules**. A lot of family placements end because the family member is breaking the rules due to pressure from other people. If the state says that they get a phone call a night, they get a phone call a night. If they get two visits a week, they get two visits a week. The state will structure the conditions of return for the kids and you, as a placement home, will be required to abide by those, no more and no less. Visitation might be pulled, for example, after a failed urine analysis. Pressure from the parent or from outside family members have more than once convinced a family placement home to allow visitation anyway. That can get you in trouble, but it doesn't seem like that's a major concern for you. 

Another important detail is that, if parental rights are terminated, adoption first and foremost goes to relatives. They get the first shot at adopting the kids. After that, the foster family gets dibs, and then they are usually put on the larger national adoption market. Almost all foster adoption procedures are run with a Guardian Ad Litem that makes recommendations to the court about the best interest of the child. "

dbaker102194,AskMen,1389486250.0,"**TL:DR; A friend of mine gets rejected, the girl walks right up to me and kisses me.**

Travelling abroad with a group of fellow Americans. Some of the group were minors. I was 19. So, not quite a minor. We ran into a Norwegian youth group. The oldest of them was 17, this included two girls who were just knock out beautiful. 

There was a kid in our group, I'll call him Stu. Stu was a socially awkward 17 year old. Actually, he was fine around other dudes. But throw a girl into the mix and he immediately becomes the most awkward guy imaginable. 

We quickly befriended the Norweigan kids. And Stu clearly had a thing for Pretty Girl #1. Now, Pretty Girl #1 did not speak english. She spoke french (which I do speak) and german (I speak enough to get by but nowhere near fluent) and Norweigan. Pretty Girl #2 spoke flawless english. Both of them were really cool. I felt a little weird about it because back in the states, it would be socially unacceptable for me to make any sort of move on these girls. So I didn't. 

One night our (american) group was having dinner at this nice restaurant which also had a dance floor. While we were eating the Norwegian group shows up. After dinner a bunch of people start dancing. I'm not super big on dancing, but I get out on the floor anyway. Stu gets out on the floor, but he refuses to dance. He just kinda stands awkwardly near pretty girl #1. 

Later Pretty Girl #2 asks me to come dance with them. So I do for a little while. Then go sit back down. A bunch of people are trying to get Stu to make a move on Pretty Girl #1. But he's just so awkward he won't. 

Pretty Girl #2 is trying to get Pretty Girl #1 to make a move on Stu. And she asks me to help out. We end up with a ""You two do exactly what we're doing."" situation. So we dance. Stu is awkward and reluctant. A couple songs later we all go sit down. I'm talking to them. Stu sits there awkwardly (the conversation would switch to french from time to time since we all, except Stu, spoke it.) 

Then we get another round of ""You two do exactly what we do. Pretty Girl #2 snuggles up against me a little bit. And Pretty Girl #1 does the same to Stu, but he's totally lost and has no idea what to do from there. #2 kisses me on the cheek. #1 Does that to Stu. He looks totally bewildered. I kiss #2 on the cheek. Stu is too scared to kiss #1. We laugh it off and just keep talking. 

Time to call it a night, so we're about to part ways. Hugs all around. Kisses on the cheek (I'm not sure if that's a Scandinavian thing or not, but it was that night.) Then the brilliant idea. ""Stu should kiss #1."" Everyone's in agreement. Stu starts leaning in awkwardly. ""Is it okay?"" He asks #1. She doesn't speak English, she has no idea what he's saying. He assumes that means ""no"" and backs off. #1 rolls her eyes, turns towards me and kisses me. Stu was crushed. It was hilarious and sad at the same time. 

We left the next morning and never saw them again. (I'm still in contact with them on facebook, twitter, etc.) Probably the best night of my life in recent memory. That was like 8 months ago now. Anyway it was fantastic, I still give Stu shit about that."

There's a bunch of talk about her flying around and whatnot so it seems like it's not just a poetic description of her being a shieldmaiden. But she is also pretty clearly the daughter of a mortal, Hogni.

Then at the end of that same story, it's mentioned that, ""Helgi and Sigrun are said to have been reborn. He was then known as Helgi Haddingsjaskadi, and she as Kara, Halfdan's daughter, as is mentined in 'Kara's song,' and she was a valkyrie."" Page 145 in Orchard."

KrisJade,Paranormal,1389486495.0,"Sorry in advance for the wall of text response.

I live in Lawrence, not far from Topeka. For the last few nights I've heard an unusual amount of random noises at night. Usually, I write those noises off as the normal shifting expected from one of the oldest houses in town. I believe in paranormal incidents, but I'm also a scientist by trade, so I'm quite skeptical. 

That said, I still get the crap scared out of me and my mind wanders off to weird places. As I said, the noises as of late are out of the ordinary. There has never been anything strange about this house during the two years I've lived here. My husband works nights, so I'm generally alone with two small children. That's never bothered me until recently. After the children are asleep I usually get a bit of housework done. While doing stuff in the kitchen this week, it sounds like someone is upstairs. Check on the children, nope, asleep. Doing laundry in the basement, and it sounds like someone is walking above me in the kitchen. Go upstairs to work in the office, and I can't tell you how many times I've sworn my husband had come home early. Heard the door, and shuffling about. Wait a while for him to come find me...nothing. Call out, no answer. Eventually I head downstairs and the doors are locked, nothing is disturbed. He's not back. Then it sounds like someone is walking on the roof.

Last night was the worst yet. A few noises, not too much. It's Friday night in a college town, so I don't think much of it. About 11:45ish and I'm upstairs in the office. I distinctly hear the front door knob turn twice, and the door sounds like it begins to open. The front door is directly across from the stairs and the office door looks right down the stairs. I wait a few seconds, expecting to hear him on the stairs, even though he usually uses the back door in the kitchen...silence. I get a really weird feeling, so I run down stairs to the front door. Locked. No one in sight. Nothing. I'm fairly certain it was probably some drunk person stumbling here from a nearby bar, it still frightened me quite a bit... but seriously, now that I've read your post, I'm glad I won't be alone tonight. Thoroughly creeped out!"

lendrick,startrek,1389486558.0,"In all honesty, this might be the only viable continuation.

The trouble with Star Trek now is that it's kind of played out.  If they stick too close to the old formulas, it'll feel like a rehash of TOS and TNG.  If they try something too different from the old Trek, people will say that ""it doesn't feel like Star Trek"" and it'll get cancelled.  There's also that delicate balance of referencing canon enough to please fans but not so much as to drive off newcomers.

A Captain Worf series might actually be able to pull this off, if it's well-written, and most of the current crop of ideas for a new Trek series won't be able to do that.

In all likelihood, though, we probably won't have another Trek series until the movies are over, and maybe not for a while after that.  I think sometimes shows like Star Trek are easier to bring back after a long time has passed."

Buscat,AdviceAnimals,1389486583.0,"Alright look, here's how you cook an omelette kids. Cast iron pan. You don't need nonstick, because nothing's going to save you if you don't understand the first thing about cooking eggs.

First off, if you're adding anything to it, do it in a different pan beforehand. You'll want about 2-3 eggs per omelette, depending on the size of your pan. You can put cream or milk in them if you want, but let's just try it with eggs alone first.

Get your pan good and hot first. Not scorching hot, but I put my cast iron pan on the burner set to medium for like 5 minutes before I do anything. You're going to need to learn your stove and your pans and estimating heat, or you could buy an infrared thermometer. I've heard that about 400 F is good pan temp.

Once the pan's hot, you need to oil it up, I use butter, but thats pretty time sensitive since butter burns if left alone in a hot pan for more than a couple of seconds. If you're a noob use veggie oil or something. You don't need much oil, but it needs to touch everything. I take a tiny knob of butter and a paper town and slide it along the whole bottom and inside wall of the pan.

Now, you should have your eggs beaten already (I assume you're not reading this in real time.). Stir in a little salt if you want, and pour that shit in the pan. you should be able to see and hear it cooking instantly.  rotate it around a bit after a minute or so. you'll see most of the egg has cooked, but just get the runny bit moving around so things go evenly. After a little bit more time, add in your mushrooms/cheese/whatever the fuck is going in your omelette. This stuff should all be cooked before going in, because there's no way you're going to be able to cook it now inside some eggs.

Now, you may find this hard to believe, but after about 2 minutes you should be able to get your spatula under that thing and flip it closed. Nothing should be stuck to the pan.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

- **The egg is stuck to the pan everywhere**

You either used no oil, or the pan was too cold when you put the egg in. If the pan is too cold, the egg will sink past the fat and be touching the pan itself when it cooked, and this is how you get sticking. Don't be afraid of the heat. A hot pan will cook the bottom of the egg before it can get stuck.

- **The bottom of the omelette is burnt**

You either got the pan too hot beforehand or kept your omelette in too long. You can give a few little test lifts pokes under the omelette as it cooks with your spatula.

- **It mostly worked, but one corner of the omelette stuck to the pan**

You didn't oil that part of your pan before putting the eggs in.

So, there you go. You should have a nice evenly cooked omelette that holds together, and your pan should have nothing stuck to it. **It will take a little practice and you will probably fuck it up a few times.** But anyone can learn to do it and it's a good start towards cooking well with eggs and not eating total shit from the frozen foods section."

""They"" only includes military when the *individual soldiers of the military actually uphold their belief in the authority of those over them*. If for example, Congress or the President told U.S. soldiers to simply start mass-executing citizens, it's possibly there would be an internal conflict within the military -- a resistance, a refusal.

Rhino and Frost are the most traditionally recognized tank warframes. You can read more about them on the Warframe Wiki: http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki

&gt; Also I've been reading a lot about this ""find a farming weapon"" reply, either I suck at searching or I don't know what you all are talking about.

This basically means a weapon that you've leveled to 30, and can kill effectively with. This is your ""Farming Weapon,"" as it allows you to remain useful to your team while you mooch off their XP. 

XP gain whenever you have teammates works a bit strangely. Short version: every kill your teammates make gives you XP, which is evenly distributed across your Warframe, Primary, Secondary, and Melee, allowing you to ""passively"" level up items without ever having to use them! The ""Farming Weapon"" allows you to have one weapon that you can reliably kill with so you're not just standing around stealing XP."

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1389486628.0,"That's why I hate all of that talk so much, it is even all over this thread where people are trying to be sensitive on the whole.

Every ""I prefer 'X'"" is automatically going to make every non-X person get a little kick in their stomach.  We incorporate negative messages much more than positive ones.

This applies to so many things.  Of course I have preferences on what I like physically about guys.  But they pretty much only get mentioned privately to female or gay male friends.  Why even put it out there?  You can still go after what you want.  

It happens on both sides.  Guys will proclaim: small breasts are the best!  Big breasts are the best!  Brunettes all of the way!  Girls will do the same about guys.  All it does is make people feel like crap.  Just like what happened in your convo with your group of friends.  If your girlfriend or boyfriend has something you find attractive, tell them!  If they have something that you aren't into, keep your mouth shut.  

The message we should put out there is that everything can be great.  Then go and get what you are into.  

So, for those of you in this thread, if you are down with circ or non-circ penises, feel free to say so, but please refrain from ""Circ/not-circ is so much more attractive"" etc.  because it is shitty.  

That is the end of my rant.  

But honestly, not just saying so, both varieties of penises can be completely hot."

Understanding your programming well enough to plan out features that are swappable with other things that you create (say going from a 2d pong to a 3d pong) will serve you better than anything else.

1. Climate change, absolutely. I don't think we're in a position to stop this from happening, but we may be in a position to try to predict its outcomes, prepare for them, and (with any luck) slow it down and buy ourselves a little time. If we don't, well…who can say what will happen? Life will go on either way, but we may not be here to see it.

2. I'm much more iffy about this one (there are so many options!), but I'm inclined to say overfishing. We know so little about the oceans that we don't even know how much damage we are doing to these ecosystems, and so much human life is dependent upon them. There is also no easy way to solve this problem, since the oceans are a kind of no-man's land; it's a tragedy of the commons. How can a country protect the fisheries it depends upon if it does not have the right/ability to exclude foreign fishing activity? I fear the only way forward is to *drastically* increase every coastal nation's economic exclusion zone and to permit them (or even help them) to defend it aggressively."

Except for the personal ones like from the girl also named Alaska or that John Green drank Strawberry hill wine in high school. All of the things directly related to the themes in his books, I already knew.

John Green isn't Joyce, Woolfe, Pynchon, Murakami or Bolano, the kinds of things I typically read. I picked up John Green out of boredom and a desire for a few 'fast burn' books, meaning books I could finish in a few hours if I wanted to. His themes, messages, symbols and metaphors are not exactly the heavy stuff of advanced literature, it's young adult fiction and that's all he bills it as. He is not trying to be the next Faulkner or Tennessee Williams, his stories are just fun little books that will appeal to teens. He is not writing on the same caliber as the big girls and boys. Again, I am not stupid nor oblivious, I completely comprehended what he was going for because anyone with a high school reading level could completely comprehend what he was going for. I just happen to think other people have done it much better.

My point is, these things seemed poorly written and/or forced (which means poorly written). I don't think John Green is a bad writer in general, but I think he has some critical weaknesses as a writer that definitely detract from the (mostly enjoyable) whole. If those flaws weren't there, I would enjoy him much more."

Pairing: Castiel/Meg, Garth/Becky


Rating: Explicit 


Summary: ""If you want to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first create the universe."" -- Carl Sagan 


This is a redemption story, folks. And it's beautiful.


Commentary: So, I'm really freaking nervous as I've yet to recommend a fic to fanfiction thursdays, but I loved this story so much I can't keep it to myself. Gonna sound like a softie and I'm not sorry in the slightest-- but I cried while reading this, you guys. It hit so many of my buttons. If you aren't a fan of Becky normally she's not as...*intense* as she was on the show. We see a more serious side at times that makes her easier to relate to. I genuinely grew to care about what happened to her. I could say so much more, but I don't wanna ruin anything.

I knew who I was as an adult, and the insecurity just went away. Another big problem was him still being in school. Working, going to school full time, and trying to support your sick uninsured wife would take a toll on anyone. There was never much fighting or arguing, just stress and not knowing what to do. There's always a chance as you get older you could grow apart, but if you don't want that to happen you really have to work on growing together. Even with all the stress we made time for each other and kept loving each other.

nostalgicBadger,AskMen,1389487201.0,"&gt; So the holocaust happening isn't open and shut?

That's not subjective; it's a historical fact. Whether religion should be banned is subjective, as are most statements that contain the word ""should"". 

&gt; A few hundred (or thousand, depending on whether you count Socrates and some of his students (and their students) as a proponent of religious freedom) years of logical, well explained philosophy.

Wait, logic that proved what? Plenty of highly influential philosophers didn't condone or were flat-out anti-religion, most notably Nietzsche. 

&gt; And if you think getting rid of the 1st amendment is a popular opinion among US citizens, you're wrong :)

I don't think it's popular, but I don't think it's ""flat out wrong"" either. I disagree with people who want to ban religion, but I've heard them make some valid points, and my disagreement is based at least partly on my personal values. There's no way we could possibly know whether outlawing religion would be objectively better for society in the long run. I'm not disagreeing with your stance on the First Amendment; I'm disagreeing with your conviction that there's no merit to the other side."

LOLextraHard1234,pebble,1389487213.0,"Well, I'm a new Pebble owner, but here's some of my reasons.

1.  I started wearing watches again about 3 years ago, so this is a natural extension of that since I'm also a smartphone user.

2.  It's programmable with an SDK and an active developer community with C and JS.  I think most of the smartwatches that were introduced at this year's CES, for example, are effectively doomed to low adoption without community support and dev kits.  The major mobile OSes are support:  Android and iOS are supported, and I imagine that official Windows Phone support, too, in the future if that OS gains more users/marketshare.

3.  Corollary to last reason:  Customizable with apps and watchfaces to your tastes and software availability.

4.  Low power usage, not needing to recharge the sucker every day (esp. useful if I forget).

5.  Minimalist design with a tight focus on watchfaces, notifications and sports/fitness.  Reminds me of the Apple design aesthetic.   No touchscreen is fine for me because it forces what the device should be:  a timepiece that is a companion to a phone, not a phone replacement.  Sure, a mic could be useful for barking commands to Siri or whatever but this is the first iteration of the device.  But for now, all you really need is vibration and a backlight anyway.

6.  Relatively low cost of the Sport version:  Can be bought for $80-ish for a beat up one, $100-$115 for a decent used one, to $120-$130 for a new on Amazon, eBay, or craigslist.  Considering I mostly wear Casios from $20-$300, it's definitely on the low-end of the price range for the added functionality minus the likely limited lifespan of the battery.

7.  I like plastic watches because they are lightweight.

8.  Standard 22mm bands can be had pretty much anywhere.  The wide ones that match the watch width look cool.

9.  The watchface is readable in daylight.  

10.  It's just fun to play with."

codayus,AskMen,1389487313.0,"The easy answer is:  When you're confident that you won't want any (more) children, and that you won't change your mind about this.

The hard truth is that a lot of people are convinced they won't want kids when they're young, and then they change their minds later; peak time for that is probably late 20s, early 30s when you start feeling those very first hints of mortality (can't stay out all night drinking any more and still pull a full work day; your knee sometimes gets a bit stiff if you've been sitting at a desk all day; etc.), and you start thinking about the fact that maybe you want to leave something behind when you're gone or whatever.

If you've already had kids, you're probably immune to the ""holy shit, I'm getting old!  I should spawn!"" thing, but there's still the possibility of your current relationship ending, and you getting with someone new and one (or both) of you deciding you really want kids with them.

Then again, you may just not ever want kids.  What it comes down to is asking yourself ""how do I know I won't change my mind?""  If you've got a good answer to that, then snip away.  There's no hard age limit; just the fact that the older you are, the lower the odds of you changing your mind later."

This is a meaningless value statement. I'll counter and say what's the point of property rights if they do not serve humanity? Because, clearly, based on your next sentence, it appears you don't give a crap about whether they actually serve humanity well. I say no one should go hungry or homeless in a society as rich as ours. It would be totally different if America could not afford to do such a thing. But we can, but won't. Mainly because of attitudes like yours.

Note to self, put this in the next week's morally reprehensible quote thread (unless someone wants to add it to this week's). I mean, who gives a **** about ""fairness"" when we're talking about people starving to death!?

Now, you could argue if social security didn't exist, people would have been able to save for retirement, but considering how 76% of americans are [living paycheck to paycheck](http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/24/pf/emergency-savings/), that is a laughably ridiculous statement. Moreover, a lot of payroll taxes are paid by the employers as well, so eliminating these programs would hurt people. 

Ajnd let's not forget, even if you dislike the system, eliminating it screws over millions of Americans and literally DOES turn it into a ponzi scheme. So really, it seems to me that social security is only doomed to failure because small government conservatives and libertarians are dead set on undermining it, or refusing to fund it properly.

AFormidableContender,confession,1389487421.0,"&gt;The X/10 system is not really accurate, because someone I think is a 9/10, my friend might call a 5/10.

That happens far less than women like to admit, because they are morally opposed to the 10 system in the first place. 

A person one person views as a 9, the other may view as a 7, but both will agree the person is not a 2. 

&gt;But again, unless you are extremely disfigured, you will be able to meet women. Maybe not 10,000, but still quite a few. I know a lot of 4/10 guys with girlfriends.

A GF is not ""meeting women"" Many people can find 1 person in the world for commitment. The issue is casual sex with quality individuals. 

&gt;TRP doesn't have any ethical basis. I'm surprised they aren't advocating rape (the more extreme ones kind of do).

You're avoiding replying to my position...

My position is: You are expecting men to accept a lower quality of life for the benefit of women. This is entitlement. I posit that you cannot/could not propose a method as effective as TRP without what you deem the moral negativity.

&gt;I'm not asking anyone to have a lower quality of life. 

Yes you are. A lower sexual partner count, with lower quality individuals, is a lower quality of life. 

&gt;Then again, I don't equate sex with quality of life.

Becaue you're a woman and get it for free. This is the problem when debating the merits of TRP or seduction with women. They have no perspective or ability to empathize. 

&gt;What I am saying, is that just because you want sex, doesn't mean you are entitled to it.

Just because you want respect, doesn't mean you are entitled to it. If TRP works for me, I'm going to do it. 

&gt;I'd rather see someone have no sex than see someone be forced or pressured into having sex.

Luckily, what /u/The_Mermaid wants doesn't matter in this world. At least...not enough to make me sacrifice my quality of life to live up to your moral standards you, for some reason, think I should obey...

It's things like that that make me positive you take advantage of people regularly in your daily life. There is no way a rational human being that works for what they earn would, in any universe, posit that they think their moral edict should outweigh the quality of life and happiness of others.  

&gt;I wouldn't even attempt to pick that guy up. He looks like a douche bag. I like guys that are handsome, but also nice.

So? Many would. This point isn't about you, it's about women. 

&gt;Also, unattractive women have a hard time meeting guys too, especially handsome men. Especially if they aren't the type to approach men.

A woman has significantly less difficulty finding sexual partners than a man of the equivolent level of attractiveness. 

&gt;I didn't earn any female-only scholarships (I am pro-Affirmative Action though).

In other words, you support sexism/are sexist. Ok, that's improtant to note. 

&gt; And if some guy buys me a drink, that's up to him. Buying me something will not make me have sex with you. I don't ask for free stuff, but when it's offered, I'll take it. Just don't expect sex in return.

In other words, you enjoy benevolent sexism as well. Also important to note. 

Also, interesting to note that you spent quite a while firmly denying you enjoy the benefits of benevolent sexism, and then blatantly admit you enjoy the privilges of, and support benevolent sexism. 

&gt;Everyone deserves respect.

Yet you don't respect men...

&gt;Everyone deserves respect. However, some men seem to think that means women having sex with them whenever they want, and being obedient and submissive.

Lol....*sigh*

Do you...like....think men just walk around getting sex left right and centre? Only about 20% of men, the alpha males, actually get sex. They get over 80% of the sex, especially amongst attractive women. Women like you are not competing for the fucking shmucks. TRP is a method by which men who get NO sex, can get SOME sex. 

Falsly characterizing it as ""men thinking they can get sex whenever they want"" is so ludicous I'm not sure you have any right to be discussing this issue at all. 

&gt;No, women aren't the cause. The reason some guys don't meet women is because they have shitty entitled attitudes.

Damn. You know what? You're right....you and all your friends would totally fuck this guy: [http://daveschneider.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/uglyman-244x300.jpg] if he didn't have such an entitled attitude, right? He'd be ROLLING in pussy! Right!?

NOTHING ELSE MATTERS EXCEPT YOUR ATTITUDE :D! MEN, REJOICE!

You know what, I love women. Women are great. In fact, women are way better than men. Can I have sex with you now?

&gt;I do not believe in social value. Just because I am flirting with someone doesn't mean I value them more than someone else.

If you choose to flirt with person X and not person Y, person X must necessarily have more value, or you'd flirt with EVERYONE. 

The act of prioritizing X over everyone necessarily means you must value X's opinion above everyone else's, and therefore, believe in social value. 

&gt;I'm fucking obnoxious? No, that wall of text above is fucking obnoxious. You try going out, minding our own business, and having rude men shout vile things at you, and having men in cars follow you and honk. And never knowing whether the guy following you is a relatively harmless creep, or has plans to rape and kill you.

I have. You know how I handle it? By not being a fucking pussy about it. Anyone can get attacked at any time...it's not a female issue, it's a human issue."

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1389487712.0,"&gt;That's not subjective; it's a historical fact. Whether religion should be banned is subjective, as are most statements that contain the word ""should"".

Is it? Do you know that for sure? You've been told that. You might even know people who claim to have been there, but maybe it's a conspiracy. Maybe it's all a lie. How can you know for sure? 

At some level, you've decided to have faith in your society's perception of things. You can't know much for certain, you just aren't big enough, so you have to take certain things for granted in order to operate and form a worldview. Farmers in Iran have done the same thing. What makes your decision to believe your society more sane or well founded than theirs?

The same thing that makes mine more in regards to the 1st amendment. I know more than the other side. I know what effect government control over hugely emotional issues like religion can have. Revoking it would be disastrous. People who disagree with me tend to do so out of ignorance or insane religious (or irreligious) zeal. You might be able to dig up knowledgeable people who disagree, but they're few and far between. Even intelligent, eloquent, knowledgeable haters of religion don't tend to be against religious freedom because they realize it's impractical to take it away from people. "

Did you just completely switch sides? You seem to have gone from ""religion is open and shut"" to ""everything is subjective"". 

&gt; I know more than the other side.

And they probably feel the same way, and some of them probably went to better colleges and pursued a higher degree of education than you did, so that's not a very strong argument.

&gt; Even intelligent, eloquent, knowledgeable haters of religion don't tend to be against religious freedom because they realize it's impractical to take it away from people.

And now we're back to appealing to the majority, which is still a fallacious argument.

See, when you start claiming that things are capital-T True, you dig yourself a pretty deep hole, because then you have to actually prove it.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389488065.0,"&gt;But we see plenty of evidence that modern socialist systems have faults.

Of course they do, no system is perfect.

&gt;. How is the existence of evidence against socialism not as important as the lack of evidence for or against the (sorry for the following taboo of a word) libertarian system?

Well, first of all, unless we're talking about actual COMMUNIST countries (and I hope you're not because this leads to strawmen), the flaws in so called socialist countries (assuming you're talking western europe) are largely overblown. For example, I see libertarians attack socialized healthcare because a few people died in an emergency room due to government bureaucracy, totally ignoring our own system's ENORMOUS death toll due to lack of coverage and the like. 

I mean, I don't deny our system has flaws. I don't deny European style systems have flaws. But a libertarian system just sounds like a failure from the get go.

Here's the thing about extreme forms of libertarianism....it's like communism. It's so over the edge and unrealistic it's doomed to fail, because it often makes wild utopian claims and assumptions about human nature not backed up by evidence. 

And even on a conceptual level...like what you said to be about it not being who lives and who dies...I mean, who WANTS to live in a world like that? Your entire worldview is screwed up and based on the wrong priorities IMO from the get go. When your system is not centered around human life, both protecting and improving it, it's got some pretty messed up priorities IMO, and isn't worth following. A moral system that doesn't serve humanity, IMO, is not moral, and fails at its primary purpose."

Jnic815,AskMen,1389488122.0,"*cringes* sorry its a long one but yeah..... 

Story: I was visiting one of my closest friends who is now pursuing his masters at a large SEC school (I am a senior undergrad). It was a home football game weekend so there were tons of people in town and parties etc. We went to a party with his co-workers all of which are students, one of his female co-workers also had friends in town and one of them is the girl I'm speaking of. When they came in I immediately noticed her and thought she was cute, but we were playing beer pong at the time so I couldn't talk to her. Well we finally got beat and kicked off the table so I sat down on the couch to watch, within a minute she was sitting next to me introducing herself. The details are a bit fuzzy cause of the alcohol but I remember us laughing and talking for quite a while until I was grabbed to play beer pong again, this cycle went on for the rest of the night.

Next day we wake up at my friends apartment with a wicked hangover and don't go tailgating. Fast forward to the stadium about an hour before kickoff. We get in the stadium and sit with some of his co-workers and suddenly up comes female co-worker and her friends, they come sit next to me and the girl I am interested in asks the co-worker next to me to trade seats.

So we start talking and this is where shit really starts going over my head, she starts playing with her hair and says ""so (insert co workers name) says that (insert my friends name) is married, are you married?"" I reply no, she asks ""engaged?"" I reply ""hmm nope"", she asks ""in a relationship at all?"" I reply no mam I am not. She then tries to be smooth and stands up to ""fix her dress"" but when she sits down she is about six inches closer to me. We continue to talk and the subject makes it to schools, turns out she is also a fan of this SEC school and wants to transfer here and I tell her I am also I lifelong fan and want to go to grad school here. She immediately says ""if I transfer you have to come to grad school here so we can hang out more"" I reply ""yeah grad school is so expensive but I want to."" Things are moving along nicely then during a media timeout when things slow down in the stadium and everyone sits down she puts her head on my shoulder and says ""this makes a good pillow"" rubbing my shoulder. The game goes on and we continue talking and having fun, paying more attention to each other than the game. After an exciting 4th quarter and last second win I suggest we all go downtown and participate in this schools post game tradition.

We make it out of the stadium and this is where things go south, her large friend who has been here the whole time says ""that's a long walk I don't want to go that far"" we say bye reluctantly and they head back to their car and we go downtown. After we leave downtown and start walking back to the car my friend says so she seemed pretty into you, and this was when I became painfully aware of how oblivious I had been. I asked if it was obvious and he just looked at me and said ""dude......"" I just said ""I didn't get her number"" he replies ""WHAT!?"" then immediately starts texting his co-worker to get her number and I stopped him cause I thought it was weird. 

TL;DR I was painfully oblivious to a beautiful girls advances only to become aware after I missed my shot and didn't get her phone number."
Tuala08,AskWomen,1389488122.0,"I don't judge if people have slept with lots of people, but I do feel uncomfortable dating someone who has 3 times my number.

littlestray,sex,1389488377.0,"I've two thoughts here, but I'm assuming it's the latter. 1) quite a few girls begin to feel like they are burdening their partners by taking too long or being too much work, and once they start to think this way--which brings in self consciousness--it's simply harder to let oneself go and just enjoy what's going on. Could be guilt. I've gone through it before but luckily gotten comfortable and fully accepted that my partner doesn't mind me taking awhile because it's supposed to be FOR me anyway. 2) Sometimes any sex act that is repetitive, even if it feels good, starts to feel uncomfortable because you're stimulating the same area in the same way for too long. Ladybits are sensitive.

If you guys are comfortable with it, perhaps begin with what you already do but transition to oral after she feels discomfort?"

Necron_Overlord,movies,1389488697.0,"&gt;I was merely saying it has already kind of proved to be an accessible origin story in the Thor films so why not.

Sure, but the ""all women"" aspect of Paradise Island does make things different.  I mean, Asgard has women -- we see Sif and Freya for sure -- so when Thor falls for Jane Foster, that makes sense.

But imagine if Asgaard was all dudes.  A world of all dudes who dress like that?  Everyone would assume they were gay.  Then when Thor fell in love with Jane, you'd be like ""Wait, he's straight?  So is he the only straight Asgardian?  Or are there just thousands of horribly frustrated dudes in Asgard who have no idea that Earth is full of human babes?""

It's even more problematic with Paradise Island, because of feminists.  You can't just add men to Paradise Island, feminists would scream bloody murder.  You can't *not* mention it or deal with it, not in the 21st century.  It wouldn't feel real.

I'm not saying it can't be done, I'm just saying -- they're been trying to make a Wonder Woman movie for 15+ years, and a half dozen great screenwriters have tackled the story -- including Joss Whedon, who definitely knows how to write stories with powerful female leads -- and all have failed to produce a workable script that made sense.

But with that kind of setup, other than for perhaps racing or flight simulators, the side monitors are not very useful. Having a super wide field of view doesn't often improve much in first-person games, and a lot of other games like starcraft or league of legends don't support triple monitor (as you have a set area of the game you are allowed to see anyway). I might suggest for now, you get a single gtx 770 or radeon 280x, and when you save up some more money, upgrade to a 2560x1440 monitor and add a second card. A pair of either of those GPUs are excellent at that resolution. "

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1389489035.0,"&gt;Did you just completely switch sides? You seem to have gone from ""religion is open and shut"" to ""everything is subjective"".

I'm making the point that we decide in our own minds what constitutes 'factual' information. How we reach that conclusion determines the validity of our beliefs. In practice, almost everyone makes that judgement the same way. Conspiracy theorists are reviled for choosing to *not* go along with society's opinion of 'factual' information. I would compare people who disagree with the 1st amendment with conspiracy theorists in that area. They have chosen to abandon reason in favor of their own personal pet theories because they want to, not because they have any logical reason for doing so. They also tend to be ignorant or mentally unstable. 

&gt;and some of them probably went to better colleges and pursued a higher degree of education than you did, so that's not a very strong argument.

Sure, but a negligible amount. Upbringing and mental illness can destroy the reasoning ability of even very intelligent, capable people. The fact that they hold the view doesn't make it worthwhile. 

 
&gt;And now we're back to appealing to the majority, which is still a fallacious argument.

I wasn't aware that intelligent, eloquent, knowledgeable haters of religion made up any sort of majority. 

&gt;See, when you start claiming that things are capital-T True, you dig yourself a pretty deep hole, because then you have to actually prove it.

I am making the point that we have to take certain things as True With A Capital T in order to operate. If we allow everything to slide into 'shades of gray' than any opinion can be held without stigma. Society judges people who are racist, homophobic, or intolerant badly, and it is a detriment to your life to be open with those beliefs as a result. As it should be. Likewise, *I* believe that people who disagree with me on the necessity of the 1st amendment aren't worth my time. They don't form a significant part of the political process either, so whatever. The 1st amendment protects their right to be idiots.

I've even noticed that some women (whether conscious or subconscious) don't even use the same voice when talking to a male they deem unattractive versus those that they do.  I've heard women who normally sound one way, suddenly get a deep voice with one word answers when someone whom they deem unattractive so much as asks them to pass the salt.  "

Laws are basically just mathematical relationships that tell you what we observe; a thing with *this* much mass and a thing with *that* much mass will move towards each other at *this* rate of acceleration.  Theories are the proposed explanation for why and how the law happens.  Gravity is actually a tricky one because we're not really sure why things move towards each other.  That's why CERN has been chasing the Higgs Boson - because we think that's the thing that makes gravity happen.

In political discussion when you have people advocating the apathetic ""fuck every government program that doesn't directly benefit me"" ideals of neoliberalism/libertarianism, obviously those types of comments are going to be met with great disdain. Those are very hostile &amp; callous stances. When people take up these extremist, hostile ideals of course it is going to effect the level of discourse and the climate of the comments and discussion.

Perhaps in america, but we have no such right here.

Exceptions are made when religious practices break laws... and if you change the law, then and exception has to be made.

Perhaps in america, but here it's normal, and the 'odd one' is the circumcised male... and i've never heard anyone make comments about it either way.

&gt;It's more of an abuse to subject children to the ridicule associated with being uncircumcised.

nostalgicBadger,AskMen,1389489383.0,"&gt; I'm making the point that we decide in our own minds what constitutes 'factual' information. 

That's the very definition of subjectivity.

&gt; Sure, but a negligible amount. 

You're also a statistically negligible amount of people. You're also appealing to majority again.

&gt; I wasn't aware that intelligent, eloquent, knowledgeable haters of religion made up any sort of majority.

Who makes up the majority is totally irrelevant when trying to determine whether something is true, unless that something happens to be ""what do the majority believe"", which it isn't, in this case.

&gt; I am making the point that we have to take certain things as True With A Capital T in order to operate. 

No, we don't, or at least not on issues like this. Do I have to take it as True that I exist and that my senses are more or less accurate? Well it's certainly more practical to, otherwise I doubt I could function. Do I have to believe that my opinion about religion is the only valid opinion and that everyone who disagrees with me is stupid and backward? No, and doing so isn't practical. Those people do make valid points, even if I disagree with their position, and I can usually learn something from them, whereas the mentality you're encouraging cuts you off from learning opportunities."

BullsLawDan,Parenting,1389489658.0,"&gt;You can also default on your student loans,

Defaulting on your student loans is basically the death knell for any sense of financial security.  

&gt;but your parents wont go cold/hungry if you do.

My parents can take out loans for their well-being - on their property, on their good name, on their retirement accounts, etc.  

ALL of those loans would be discharged in the event of a situation that caused them to go bankrupt.

However, my student loan debt is mine, and mine alone, forever, until it is paid.  No court on Earth can relieve me of that debt no matter how upside down my finances are.

Here's the situation we're in: The Baby Boomers did not plan for their children's college.  Their children (my generation) are, as a result, in student loan debt up to their eyeballs.  As a result, most of my generation cannot afford to save money for our children's college, which will be far more expensive and far more useless, as the value of a degree decreases.

So, the Baby Boomers will have their retirement accounts, little or no college debt, little or no housing debt, Social Security, and Medicare.

I will have huge college debt, probably little to no housing debt because my generation either got lucky or simply cannot afford a house, and we might get a portion of Social Security and Medicare.

My kids will have astronomical college debt, astronomical debt for other things, and I certainly wouldn't bet on them having Social Security or Medicare.

So, yeah, would I rather my parents' generation take a few less vacations, and buy a few fewer Cadillacs, and not buy that second house in Florida, so that their grandchildren could have a hope of a reasonable tax burden, a reasonable student loan burden, and a reasonably comfortable retirement?  Yeah, I would."

-**Hate** Tampax Pearl and all other plastic applicators with ""petal"" tips that the tampon pushes through. I cant count the amount of times the cheap plastic has scratched, bitten or pinched the tender skin of my vagina.  
-**Love** U by Kotex Pantyliners. They have super sticky glue that covers the entire backing. It adheres around edges and corners and molds so easily to you that you forget you're wearing one. I also love that the light pantyliners are practically just a light film yet do their job  
-**Hate** Kotex, Carefree and Always Pads and   Pantyliners. Purely because they have poor adhesion, bulk up and are too thick. I have a very sensitive labia area so any chafing, rubbing or bulkiness in my underwear causes friction burns and micro-tears. I would rather have to change a tampon twice as often and just use a liner for precaution than have to wear pads.

When my period is really heavy (rarely) I will wear super tampons to bed and a pad with good coverage, but I tend to be miserable about it.

I would love to try a cup like Divacup, but I have no idea how they work, how they go in or how it will feel or anything. Im not about to spend the money blindly."

And really we question why no one invested in them.  Their run rate is atrocious.  They raised about 2+ mil so far and were looking to raise an A round.  I wish they would have released their numbers, revolving this.  It would give a more informed picture.  It could have been it was just an incredibly crowded space and they were over pricing themselves.  Looking at their financials is questionable.  My best estimate is that they had 6 employees, and were paying 800k+  in salary +200k in consultant pay.  I know how much you need to live in the area and founder pre series A should have made more informed decisions.  https://github.com/everpix/Everpix-Intelligence/blob/master/Financials.md

There were a lot of decisions based on this evidence they could have made to make their company more attractive and sustainable.  They refused to budge and would rather shut down.  I'd blame the founders on this more than anything. "

Stickies actually have a maximum 200 DPS: 120 base damage/0.6 attack interval (assuming no reload necessary) = 200.

No, being overweight is largely a choice of lifestyle.

&gt;At the end of the day if you'd dealt with it earlier and realised you just shouldn't give a fuck about it, the relief would have been immense.

What the fuck?  No, you're fucking wrong.  You're a fucking idiot, and you're wrong.  I shouldn't have to deal with this shit *at all*.  Ever.  This should not be a thing anyone has to deal with.  No-one should ever feel like there's something wrong with them because they **haven't** been mutilated.

Mutilating children's genitals without their permission is **wrong**.

It's like, if 9 out of 10 children were molested by their parents, and that 10th child was like ""[What's wrong with me that I didn't get molested?](http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/151742/why-not)"" then it would not be appropriate for that 10th kid to ""deal with it and realize they just shouldn't give a fuck about it.""  That 10th kid should be like ""What the fuck is wrong with my society!?!""

Look, all I'm saying is that more games are arriving for Linux, which is a good thing, don't you agree? You are right, most of them are small indie games, some good, some not so good, but it is still a GOOD THING. The chances of big budget titles being ported over is bigger because of it, it's not a guarantee, but it is still a bigger possibility than it was a year ago. Hell, even some of the indies are practically big studio games considering the quality and content (KSP, FM 2014, Metro, Brutal Legend).

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1389490762.0,"&gt;Laconophilia (love or admiration of Sparta) was popular among nobles in Ancient Athens. Arguably that often manifested similarly to Western self-hate.

No.

I was going to write ""no, if you want that analogy to work, you need to use Persia,"" which Athens and the Greek world in general had an awfully complicated relationship with, almost a sort of hatred out of admiration. But I'm struck that a phrase like ""Western self-hate"" is as loaded as the worst game of Russian Roulette ever.

The analogy does not apply to Sparta, who, it bears mention, was a relatively democratic *polis*, and both cities had citizens enjoyed a lot more freedom than your average Ancient Greek, both built on the back of perpetual war. Laconophilia was much more a moral issue, at best analogy the sort of blinded nostalgia that the Duck Dynasty Guy went off about. It was that sort of half-nostalgia about not living in Pleasantville anymore, not:

&gt;The phenomenon of self-hate in western countries. Unknown in other parts of the world, or history. It makes you hate your own country, culture and customs but promote everything minority, foreign or obscure even at the expense of your fellow countrymen. Sad sad times we are living..."

I simplified by rolling all the income into a single individual (but still filing as married) with one state and federal deduction (OP said they just randomly guessed at that, so so did I). I deducted 13.5% pretax to simulate maxing out two 401k accounts and $500/month as a high estimate of health insurance.

Result: your rough estimate is pretty similar to ADP's calculator, which says OP and spouse combined would take home about $5783 biweekly, so really OP should probably have over $11k/month in straight cash to spend.

artthoumadbrother,AskMen,1389490849.0,"&gt;I am making the point that we have to take certain things as True With A Capital T in order to operate **as a society**. 

Happy? Truths such as 'murder is bad' or 'hating people because of the color of their skin is wrong' are generally accepted because if they weren't, quality of life would be worse. The 1st amendment is in the same class. 

&gt;That's the very definition of subjectivity.

&gt;That's not subjective; it's a historical fact.

But you seem to disagree. What do you believe? 

&gt;You're also a statistically negligible amount of people. You're also appealing to majority again.

Are you waiting for me to make an argument in favor of the first amendment? Argument from the majority implies that it's made in a vacuum. It is pretty well known in the west that a sudden refusal to allow freedom of speech and religion would result in a massive, bloody upheaval. Once again I'm appealing to common knowledge. If you disagree, feel free to say why, but if you are willing to take what you and I both know to be true, then lose the rhetorical 'gotcha' game you're playing. People who believe otherwise are *very uncommonly ignorant or mentally unstable*, which is why there are so few or a 'negligible' amount.

&gt;Who makes up the majority is totally irrelevant when trying to determine whether something is true, unless that something happens to be ""what do the majority believe"", which it isn't, in this case.

If you're waiting for me to give a detailed explanation about why the 1st amendment is important, I'm not going to give it to you (unless you genuinely disagree with me on this point). The reason why I bring up ratios of believers in the 1st amendment vs. non-believers is that it is so heavily weighted that the second party aren't politically relevant---and so not my problem. I don't care about their opinions. *I* know why they're dangerous, so does everyone I interact with, and so *I* don't have to worry about it. Just like I don't have to worry about people who believe Satan created the universe with the intention of making us all miserable. They exist, but their opinions don't matter to me at all because they have no power over me or even contact with me.

You have made the claim that their opinion has merit or value that I should recognize. I think the burden of proof is on you to make that case. This entire train of posts has been one long 'but, but, but...' without a single bit of logical argument in favor of your opinion. Get to it or shut up."

thatsmybix,Cheap_Meals,1389490983.0,"This is crazy delicious and cheap and I lived on it while I was in college: Buy a big can of V8 juice, a giant bag of frozen mixed veggies (the peas, corn and carrots blend, but really, anything works), two or three potatoes and a no salt herbal blend (the V8 already has a lot of salt in it) and if you're feeling flush, a round steak (this is an actual cut of meat) or a chuck roast (cheaper than the round steak). Dump the V8 in, then fill the can up again with water and dump that in, chop up the potatoes into bite size pieces. Slice up the meat if you've got it and toss that in, along with the herbal blend (I always used Mrs. Dash or sometimes Lipton vegetable soup mix dry envelopes, but they've since come out with other flavors. Obviously if you have a good herb and spice collection, use your own judgement but Mrs. Dash was a lot cheaper than trying to buy all those herbs separately). If you've got meat, cut it into bite-sized chunks and throw it in too. You can let that hang out on low for up to 12 hours on low, but it will be ready to eat in 6-8. About a half hour before you're ready to dig in, toss the frozen veggies in there. You could throw them in early, but they tend to turn to mush after a 10 hour hot tub soak, and that keeps them bright. This entire thing makes an enormous amount of food, is fairly healthy and probably costs about 20 cents a serving if you're doing the vegetarian version, maybe 50 cents a serving with meat. "

RichardBehiel,short,1389491142.0,"&gt; I think there is some kind of advantage to a short person's pound-for-pound lifting, but I'm not sure what it is. I am certain it's not the simple-minded explanation that people try to resort to due to their lack of understanding of biology and physics.

The concept you're looking for is the [square-cube law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-cube_law).  Here's how it works:

Imagine a magic man (I'm assuming he's a man for the sake of easy pronouns, no offense feminists) who is pretty much average except for the fact that he can change his size, as long as he keeps his proportions the same.  So like Jake the Dog, but without changing shape, just size.

This person would notice a few interesting things about changing size.  For instance, his weight and height would not be linearly related.  In other words, doubling his height wouldn't double his weight!  It turns out that height scales linearly since it only depends on one dimension, but weight scales *cubically* since it depends on all three dimensions.  

So let's say he starts off at a height of 5'0"" and a weight of 100lbs, and decides to scale up to a massive height of 10'0"".  Since his height increases by a factor of 2, his weight will scale up by a factor of 8, since 2^3 = 8, and he'll end up weighing 800lbs.  

As a more realistic example, imagine that I'm the magic man.  At 6'5"" and 215lbs, I have a lean figure.  Someone with my proportions who is 5'5"" would weigh 130lbs, since 215x((5x12 + 5)/(6x12 + 5))^3 = 130.  Seems like a reasonable result, right?  If you instead did the math linearly, you'd find that the 5'5"" me would weigh 190lbs, which doesn't make sense.

Now, imagine that the magic man has a magic dumbbell that always scales with him.  It doesn't really matter how big the dumbbell is, as long as it grows whenever the man grows, and shrinks whenever the man shrinks.  Like their magic is linked or something, I don't know.  

So let's say the man is 5'0"", 100lbs, and has a 10lb dumbbell.  Since weight scales cubically, 10'0"" version of him has a 80lb dumbbell (10x2^3 =80).  That means the guy who is twice as tall now has to lift *eight* times as much weight!

But wait a minute, how does his strength compare at 5'0"" versus at 10'0""?  Surely the big guy is stronger, but how does strength scale?  Linearly?  Cubically?  Well since the magic man always keeps his proportions the same, his strength will scale as a *square*, because it's proportional to the cross-sectional *area* of his muscles.  So the 10'0"" magic man is only *four* times stronger than the 5'0"" man!

So the proportional dumbbell has increased eight times in weight, but the man's strength has only increased four times.  The result is that the 10'0"" man is *relatively* weaker than the 5'0"" man!

If you've followed up to this point, you have an understanding of how the square-cube law works.  The moral of the story is that big things are relatively weaker than small things, because forces often depend on volume whereas strength often depends on cross-sectional area.  This is why bridges and buildings have a limit to how big they can be, why ants can lift more than their body weight (a human-sized ant, by the way, would collapse under its own weight), why elephants can't jump, why whales have to stay in water, why anything bigger than a planet can't even hold itself up so it becomes a sphere, and why shorter people have an advantage in things like weightlifting and gymnastics.

I'd say you guys have the advantage of being dedicated to one another and wanting to make sexytimes better for everyone involved. Communication and practice is likely all you need. Also, try to make sex less *serious*, if you can joke around at any point during, or laugh at something that went awry, it really helps to take some of the pressure to ""perform"" off."

&gt; Are you waiting for me to make an argument in favor of the first amendment? 

No, not really. I think we're both in favor of preserving the First Amendment. I just want you to stop making appeals to majority while insisting that you're a logical person, because appealing to majority (""most people think..."") or to authority (""because I know more..."") are logical fallacies, and you seem to do it a lot.

&gt; without a single bit of logical argument in favor of your opinion.

See above. You aren't making logical arguments; you're making subjective statements and fallacious arguments, and based on an earlier part of our discussion, I'm not convinced you understand the difference between ""subjectivity"" and ""objectivity"", which is unfortunate, since this entire discussion has been dependent on having the ability to differentiate between them."

If the claims are true then it demonstrates that the launch was rushed, but I think we already know that.

anonlymouse,rpg,1389491373.0,"GURPS is anti-D&amp;D while still being D&amp;D. It starts off with D&amp;D and makes small changes based on frustrations people had with it. Race and class is too restrictive, so you have character points and can mix and match how you like. It's only fantasy, so you get sci fi options as well. It still keeps a lot of D&amp;D tropes though, like ability scores with 10 being average, movement rate and hit points. It ends up being something of a physical reality simulator with D&amp;D as the starting point and taking a few steps a bit closer to reality based on the understanding GURPS' designers had of reality. What it's poor at is telling any particular type of story. So it's neither generic nor universal, it's actually very specific.

FATE is sort of the anti-GURPS while still being GURPS. It addresses the problems people had with GURPS of being poorly suited to telling stories, but trades off being a pretty bad physical reality simulator. In GURPS you could knock over a barrel of oil and the oil slick would benefit and hinder everyone, depending on what they wanted to do. In FATE, if you're lucky you can have 2 characters make use of that oil slick before they have to spend FATE points for that. So it's a system that pretends to give you all this freedom (in this case, in options of what you can do, while GURPS pretends to give you freedom in the types of games you can play), while actually being very restrictive.

Each game served its purpose, GURPS gave a bit more freedom in character design than D&amp;D, while still being familiar to D&amp;D players. FATE makes it clear that you have a lot more options in what you can do, while still giving you that security blanket of being overly restrictive to keep *those evil munchkins* in check.

The thing is, WaRP/OTE does GURPS way better than GURPS, and Cosmic Patrol does FATE better than FATE. Unless you specifically want the character options while playing D&amp;D of GURPS or the limited freedom of FATE."

And you're making the assumption that I didn't take the time to think about their opinion before dismissing it? 

&gt;thus there's some room for discussion

My point, this entire time, has been that an opinion is not valuable just because it's held by someone. When a neo-nazi tells me why he hates the Jews, I don't really respond---there is no point in discussing it with them. Their minds on the subject are made up and their reasoning is completely invalid.

Basically, the Bible is considered divinely inspired, while the Book of Mormon is not. Who says the Bible is divinely inspired? The Catholic Church, and they have the authority to make that claim because of apostolic succession. Apostolic succession means that Jesus gave authority to the apostles, apostles gave authority to other people after Jesus ascended into heaven, and it continued. The people that decided the Bible was divinely inspired could all trace their authority back to Jesus in some way."

ArcherofArchet,AskReddit,1389491752.0,"Fencing.

I practically grew up in the fencing hall, I trained five days a week, and competed almost every weekend.  I went to coaching school and got my AA in coaching.  I trained kids for a while during school, too.

Then injuries caught up to me, I hurt my knees and my back, and I dropped off competing.  I moved away from my home country, all the way to California, and now I have no place to fence.  I still have my gear, tho.

Most of my friends were from fencing, too.  I was too dorky for the cool kids, but too cool for the dorks, so I had no friends in school.  But all of as at the hall were the same - a little nerdy, a little ""off,"" but also a little ""cool,"" and we spent so much time together.  I could never imagine dating a non-fencer.  I ended up marrying a saber fencer - whom I met through fencing.  Our five-year anniversary was a few days ago.  I haven't fenced in just over five years.
