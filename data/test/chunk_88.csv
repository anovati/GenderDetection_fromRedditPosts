I'm not going to say people aren't partially responsible for climate change because that wouldn't be true. And even then, it's not just that people exist is the problem, but rather its the pollution that we create. Even then, we aren't the only reason that the climate is changing. It is likely a combination of factors that are leading to a changing climate on our planet Earth. So while pollution, which many scientists are working hard to reduce, may be a factor in climate change, it is certainly not the only factor. Pollution by humans is likely a small slice of the pie unless you live a major Chinese city."

They have a strong laning phase, good wave clear and destroy towers fast. You're no longer that guy who stays back and kills everyone, you have to be much smarter about your positioning than before. Many people don't realize this yet and try to play ADC's like they did before. On top of it, the offensive mastery tree got weaker while the defensive mastery tree is a bit broken. Yes, even supports can just burn you. Probably one of the main reasons why ADC is the least favorite role recently. I've seen much more players willing to play support or jungle than AD.

2. Yes, options are pretty much 100% speculation (unless you're buying a forward for corn and will actually use the corn to feed animals or whatever, and with that it's still high speculation that the price at expiration will not be lower than what you locked in when you longed the contract.

3. People who exercise the call option are likely wanting to hold the security. As /u/blinner said, if they wanted to sell it they would liquidate the option instead and would get more for doing so, as the option still has ""insurance"" in that if the price were to drop lower than the exercise price you don't have to exercise it and that would be factored into the sale."

gioraffe32,INTP,1390854366.0,"Filipino-American, born and raised in the States. Filipino on both-sides of my family.

I think the FilAm upbringing is a little different from other East Asian-Americans. But the general pressures and expectations are there; just not nearly as forceful, I don't think.

&gt;How do you relate to the conformist, risk-averse culture?

This is pretty non-existent in my immediate and extended family. I'll say that my aunts and uncles (all in the US) are more risk-adverse than my cousins and me, but for the most part, conformity really isn't expected. I have a cousin who wants to be like Hunter S. Thompson and it's not that big of a deal.

&gt;What's your relationship with your parents like?

Pretty decent. Aside from the pressures of the next point, never any major problems with my parents. It helps a lot that although they were born in the Philippines, they were raised here. They're as American as any other American.

&gt;Do you feel pressured to attain financial and professional success, even at the expense of personal happiness? 

Yes. As an INTP, I think the pressure is magnified since I'm a ""natural"" at sciences and [sorta-kinda] math. So I was pressured into engineering and computer science. Both those areas interest me, but I'm more into the social sciences. Still wrestling with what I want to do versus what my parents want me to do.

&gt;Do you feel pressured to rebel against common misconceptions and stereotypes about your background?

Yes. Since I'm Asian *and* an INTP, I feel like that could easily lead to a label of ""smelly Asian math-nerd model-student loner."" As in some cases, that would be correct. But that's not a label I want. Strangely, even though I consider myself independent, I think I have to conform more to some ideal than if I were just exclusively INTP or Asian. In otherwords, I have to fight harder to shed those misconceptions and stereotypes. For the most part, it works."

MaximilianKohler,MensRights,1390854444.0,"&gt; Which men? It's easy to throw 'middle eastern men' under the bus in a bid to prove you're one of 'the good ones'.

Well Saudi Arabia is one that is talked about frequently. And I've heard your next paragraph mentioned before but do you really think it's those rich people who are mandating that control and culture over the women? I actually heard that one of the wealthy princes was one of the people speaking out against it.

I was under the impression that it was something ingrained in their society.

&gt;And you want to artificially ignore the plight of the general man in those countries and, to add insult to injury, pretend that it's somehow their fault that they're oppressed (because it's supposedly them oppressing women)? How does that work? Women are, and always have been, sheltered at every turn from the brutal realities of power struggles between elites who care not one whit for the common man. Just look at what's going on in Syria right now. It's not women dying in their thousands, is it? It's men. 

Hmm, that's an interesting viewpoint... Though you could also argue that it's the men who are causing the conflicts in the first place.

Also, the plight of men in those countries isn't a sexist plight; anything that men are subject to, women are also subject to *(well, besides the killing that's going on in the civil war and other military conflicts, but they're not completely immune to it and the whole point is that they have no choice in the matter)*. It's just because of the nature of those 3rd world countries.

But your argument is that ""since there are side benefits from men imposing their will upon women, that makes it ok"", which I can't agree with.

Have you read anything by Khaled Hosseini? IE: The Kite Runner, or A Thousand Splendid Suns? The latter book shows the experience of two Afghan women. I highly recommend them. Two of the best books I've ever read."

The caller asked why he goes so easy on Benjy when he berates callers but when Shuli berates someone in there he goes off on them. Howard said he had no idea what she was even saying because he's so tired. Howard said he takes some of that stuff off the air. Benjy asked to talk to Howard now for 30 seconds. Howard told him no. He told him to take it up with Gary. Howard said he doesn't want to deal with it. Howard said it's his birthday and he wants to enjoy it. Benjy said he's not talking about his birthday. Gary told Benjy to shut up now. He told Benjy to get out of the studio now. Gary told him to get up and get out now. Howard said this is irrational. Gary said he spoke to him off the air already. Howard said he doesn't want to talk about this on the air. He said he likes Elisa and he thinks she's terrific. Howard said he doesn't have to reveal what she's doing. Howard said if he wants to talk about the birthday show he has to do it off the air. Gary said he has already talked to him off the air. He said it's over and done with.


&gt;Howard said he doesn't want to talk about his girlfriend at all. Benjy said that he did already. Gary said he told Benjy not to discuss this at all. He said they're done with this. Gary told him not to bring it up again. He told him not to come to Wrap Up today either. The caller said she feels bad. She felt like she caused this.

To eat right, all you have to do is eat tons of healthy veggies, and stay away from fried foods! 

Actually no, cut out all fruits. They're full of sugar and will just make you fat. Fried foods are okay though. 

Actually no, fried foods are only okay if they're cooked in fat. Olive oil, soybean oil, stuff like that isn't good for you. Actually, cut out all beans and legumes. 

Actually no, beans and legumes are fine. Soybeans and soybean products are a good replacement for meat, which you should eat little to none if you want to lose weight. 

No, that's silly. Our ancestors ate tons of meat, so make most of your meals primarily meat-based. Only bake or grill it, though. The rarer the better. Make sure you eat lots of eggs and dairy, though. 

Oh, that's crazy talk. Stay far away from eggs, they're terrible for you and you get nothing from them you can't get anywhere else. Also, don't drink milk - we weren't designed to drink milk past infancy, so you're only doing your body a disservice by continuing to drink it. 

The best meals to eat are based off of Asian cuisine. Have you ever heard of fat Japanese, other than the sumo wrestlers? 

Again with the crazy talk! Asian cuisine is full of noodles and rice, and that stuff is practically like eating straight sugar! The only reason the Japanese are so healthy is because they exercise! 

Speaking off... exercise is as easy as just going for a jog around the block. 

Except you should *never, ever run.* Running stresses the knees and doesn't really help you lose weight. Just lift. Only lift. 

Except lifting just builds muscle, and muscle burns fat slowly. It's better to do lots and lots of cardio to build muscle slowly while burning fat in quick bursts. 

Except that overexerts the body, and if you're really heavy cardio can kill you. It's best to do low-impact exercises like yoga or pilates. 

Except yoga and pilates are just stretches - if you really wanna lose weight, you should do P90X. 

Except Crossfit is better. 

Except Insanity is better. 

No, only do those once you're actually fit. Until you get there, it's better just to eat healthy. And in order to eat healthy all you have to do is..."

A good, long, established history of success

Lot of kids are coming up and are going to help ensure we're successful for years to come

Ownership that allows the team to be the team and not be overbearing (i.e. Not Jerry Jones)

Talented Players (we have 10 olympians from 4 countries, including about half of Team Sweden)

An organization that has been the envy of the rest of the NHL the last 20 years.

Bad:

Our GM is inconsistent.  Signs old players like Cleary and Samuelsson to bad contracts, and questionable ones like 5 years for Weiss, but then does things like draft some decent pieces.  And then he does nothing at the trade deadline and it makes you want to pull your hair out.

Our team is inconsistent and sometimes makes you scratch your head.  Lose to NY Islanders 2-0, then blow away Vancouver 8-3.  Beat Chicago 5-4 and then collapse one away to Florida 5-4....things like that.

Injuries.  They're building a triage at Cobo as we speak.

Recent playoff history:  1st and 2nd round exits.  But last year we did way more than was expected of us as a 7th seed.  Knocked off the 2nd seed and forced the eventual cup winners to 7 games.

Line Chemistry:  This one's partially due to injuries, but Babs has been switching lines all over the place.  It looks like he's throwing shit at the walls and waiting to see what sticks.  When it does stick, it's amazing.  But the waiting is the hardest part.


Other teams to cheer for:  

St. Louis could use some love.  It's been a long time since they've had a team this good.  At least since the Stevens/Shanahan dilemma in the early 90s.  Everyone deserves nice things once in a while...

Tampa, because Yzerman is the GM and Stamkos is possibly the greatest scoring threat out there today.  I would rank him half a point ahead of Ovi and 3 ahead of Cindy.

Teams I will NEVER root for:

Pittsburgh.  Crosby gets hyped up all the time and ever since they ~~won~~ stole the cup in 2009, they collapsed back down to Earth.  Also, I live south of Kansas City, where they threatened to move to if they didn't get a new arena.  Pittsburgh fans (the little ship rats they are) like to brag that it was only a ploy, but I know differently.  A friend of mine worked with the group in KC that wanted them there, and they were about 35 minutes from coming to KC.  A lot of backdoor dealing and deadlines, but I am understanding they were really that close.

San Jose.  Fucking Divers.  And their fans always plan the parade.  Little do they realize that running their starting goalie 75+ regular season games and their top 6 for 26 minutes a night does not make for postseason success.

Colorado.  [This is ALL you need to know about it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7DlAjrhm9s)"

I could maybe see knitting, as knitting is something productive, but there to say being fashionable or conscious of your fashion is much more productive than drinking. There is no manliness credit score. Those people are lauded as manly icons, but it wasn't because they chose to act manly, they just acted with intent and confidence that is often associated with manliness. The same can be said for just about anyone, and in the same line it can be easy to break those characters down, Hemingway's alcoholism is definitely not something anyone should aspire to replicate.

kim-possible,AskFeminists,1390854658.0,"You absolutely have a right to be in the class but it is important to remember that you are there to learn about the experiences of others. This extends to generalizations about cis white men. One of the privileges of being part of this group is that stereotyping is not typically leveled against you. In this case, as well, the women speaking are not literally extending their generalizations to all cis white men but using it to refer to the large numbers of them that do fit these stereotypes. When you object to those generalizations and weigh in on those conversations you are making the conversation about you and devaluing what the other people in your class have to say about their own experiences of oppression. In doing so, you contribute to the cycle of oppression and silence those who need to be heard. 

If this is continually your behaviour in the class, then consider that you may be more concerned with defending yourself and other cis white males then you are with learning about the experiences of oppressed populations. If this is the case, maybe you don't belong in that particular class? I'm not saying this is the case for you but if you really are interested in learning then I would consider putting aside your pride to really listen to the experiences of the women in your class.

Effectively, I can't make a rule saying ""If this is the third time doing so, don't tell another person they are wrong"" Such a rule is unenforceable.

strangestdude,PurplePillDebate,1390854690.0,"The school gap and college gap is important to me. Boys are doing worse than girls in mandatory education. (Referring to Aus, UK, Canada, US, and Ireland statistics).

I agree with Warren Farrell's definition of power - which is it's control over one's own life, to live in accordance with one's own values. So I don't judge degrees by 'prestige' like I've observed many feminists do.

I'd try to encourage boys and men to live in accordance with their values,  which may mean to get a degree in liberal arts, or STEM fields. I don't think the goal is 'quotas' but to encourage those who have a passion to pursue their education. Right now it seems that the education culture is hostile to boys and men. (I posted you those 2 articles summarizing studies of how teachers assess boys behavior, and women marking boys lower than external examiners do).

A reminder; other countries don't charge as much for education as the US - so the point about debt is probably north america specific. (In europe -apart from england it seems - higher education is cheap. From free, to a few hundred bucks, to several thousand. But definitely not the 30 to 40 K insanity of the US.)"

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1390854700.0,"&gt;I think here we just call any collegiate instructor professor (besides TAs usually) although I guess there is a more formal definition we don't strictly adhere to.

Bingo!

There is actually a formal way of deciding who is a professor and who is not. A professor is limited to secondary education (or higher) who possesses a Ph.D. Not all professors do research, and not all those who teach at a college are professors. Many community colleges employ those with master's degrees (or sometimes lower) to teach certain courses since their experience in the field usually makes up for the lack of education.

Some universities also employ those without Ph.D's to teach and usually those people are simply referred to as ""faculty"" or ""adjunct faculty"" or some combination thereof; though usually a Ph.D is required.

I believe that the unions might also have a say in the proper terminology and thus it can have minor variations depending on geographical location."

Jardun,graphic_design,1390854803.0,"IMO, your best option for the best service would be to find a local print shop that does business card printing. I think its a better user experience than doing it online, especially since you are looking at foil stamped cards, uv coating, and you probably want it all done high quality.

Most good print shops will have access to vendors for foil printing if they can't do it in shop.

The only down fall is the potential of paying a bit more than just going online. I think its a much better experience than going online because you have more control over the variables, the print quality is usually better (not always), and you are supporting local business (which I always advocate if possible).

I may be biased in this approach though, because I work at a small shop that does large format and small format printing."

ILoveBigOil,investing,1390854810.0,"&gt; We both have student loans that will be paid off in 5-10 years. We both have good credit.

What's the interest rate on these loans? Can you immediately access the $100k (savings/checking account) or is it in something like a Roth IRA which you would need to wait 5 years for? If it's just sitting around, you're missing out on free money in one way or another. At the *very least* you could pay off the loans now and save yourself that interest expense; however, if you can invest it at a higher rate than the rate on your loans then that would be the way to go, but keep in mind the only likely way to get this kind of return is in the market, and that comes with risk. You should do a self-assessment of your risk tolerance to see what you're comfortable with.

Why don't you just use the $100k for the martial arts school?

Do you enjoy your photography business more than you would enjoy running a martial arts school? What are the financial outlooks for both businesses?

If I were you I wouldn't meet with a financial advisor; you don't seem to have enough complicated problems to work through with him/her to make the cost worth it.

**TL;DR: I would probably pay off student loans and try to invest in either photography business or martial arts school, whichever I like more, for future income stream so I only have to have 1 job when I have kids**

We are very very similar. We like the same music, the same films, the same type of games, the same books, we have the same hobbies and political views, we even have qualifications in the same subject.

I honestly never understood the phrase ""my other half"" until I met him, I don't feel complete without him, and I can't stand him not being around. The longest we've ever spent apart is 5 days and we spent that entire time talking over Yahoo Messenger (we didn't use the phone because I'm deaf). We finish the others sentences, we always know what the other one is thinking, we even have our own special sign language that no one else can understand. 

I love him so deeply, everything about him, his intelligence, his humour, his smell, the warmth when he cuddles me, there is nothing about him I would ever want to change.

While having lots of things in common can help build a relationship, the old saying ""familiarity breeds contempt"" is said for a reason. That's where the age gap makes it's mark. Ever had a friendship start based on:

""Oh I love this thing""

""Me too, what about this thing?""

""I love that too! how awesome we're so similar""


But it eventually fizzles out because you are so similar you have nothing new to talk about?

We like the same music, but from different generations, I show him the music I grew up in, and he shows me his, and it's all different. We are constantly sharing new things with each other that just wouldn't be possible if we were the same age. There is always something new we can share, and it's almost always something we'll like.

If we'd grown up with the same things, we'd have nothing new to talk about, everyday is an adventure this way, and I wouldn't change it for the world."

stinatown,AskReddit,1390854883.0,"**You will have more initial expenses than you might think.** When I moved out, I had saved up enough for my safety deposit, first and last months' rent, and a little extra. There are so many more expenses than I realized. For instance, the gas company required a safety deposit that I didn't anticipate, and the cable company charged set-up fees. We needed to spend about $100 on cleaning supplies (mop, broom, dustpan, sponges, toilet cleaner, etc), another $200 on getting pantry essentials and our first major grocery trip. There were other things that I took for granted when I was at my parents' house--I needed to buy a tool set, my own toiletries, pots and pans, Ziploc bags, a fire extinguisher, whatever. We also had to furnish and decorate. 

My advice? 

- Tell people that you're getting your first place. I had a coworker give me a kitchen table and a whole set of dishes/cutlery she didn't need. Another coworker gave me a bookshelf. I was not too proud to take anything.

- Check out tag sales, garage sales, Goodwill, and thrift stores. We went every weekend for two months before we moved in, piling stuff in our parents' garages. We looked for stuff we could refurbish or repurpose. At tag/estate sales, talk to the people running it and tell them you're moving into your first place. At one estate sale, the people gave us some stuff they couldn't sell, as it was the last day and we were buying a bunch of other things. At another, a guy told us to fill up a basket with kitchen gadgets and he'd sell them for a flat price. If you're friendly and willing to accept secondhand stuff, you can get a lot for free. 

- If you have a birthday coming up, ask someone who might get you something (like parents/grandparents) for something you need. My roommate's birthday was the week we moved in; he asked for a kitchen cart that we needed but was out of our budget, and his parents got it for us.

- Remember that you don't need to have everything on the first day. You probably need a bed right away, but you can wait on getting a rug. Make a list of everything you need, and decide if you need it now, if you need it soon, or if you just want it. 

- Once you're moved in, have a housewarming party. Tell everyone to bring a bottle of alcohol or a disposable household item, like toilet paper or paper towels. Boom--you're stocked up on those."

Then Jason Todd, who was brained and blown up by Joker when Robin, and came back from the dead.

Then Tim Drake who's Red Robin, and was, according to what we can tell never actually Robin the side kick

Finally Damian.  You just need to know he's the son of Bruce, and Talia Al Ghul, the daughter of Ra's Al Ghul.  Start reading Batman, and Batman &amp; Robin together.  Once the shit starts hitting the fan in Batman's first story-arch, they cross over.  

**Warning: B&amp;R as well as Batman inc become pretty relevant to the events in the last 6 batman comics that have come out.**

**Time:** What's important to remember is that it's been accepted that every 1 year of comic time in the DCU is 4-5 years our time and the new 52 started 3 years ago.

If I had to choose between photography and martial arts, I would choose martial arts, it is my true passion.

I understand now that photography was not the wisest choice, since I know very few photographers who do photography exclusively without some other form of financial support, but when I was going into college it seemed like a really profitable idea, at least compared to my other interests.  I definitely enjoy it more than my current day job and am pretty good at it, but it will probably another three or four years before it's profitable enough for me to quit my day job.

slapdashbr,buildapc,1390855310.0,"I would re-arrange the selection criteria. 

1: Pick your monitor (at least the resolution). For example 1080p, 60Hz is the most popular as there are a large variety of quality affordable options. Enthusiasts might go with 120-144Hz at 1080p or 2560x1440 or larger resolutions. 

2: Pick the graphics card, in your budget, that will give you acceptable frame rates for your monitor. Typically recommended are anything from a 650 Ti boost for $150, and higher. Anything less than that is unlikely to get satisfactory performance at 1080p unless you are willing to really cut down the quality settings. If this computer isn't for gaming, just use integrated graphics. 

3: pick a suitable CPU for your budget that has enough power to keep the GPU running smoothly. Overclocking is optional, but if you pick an overclocking CPU, get a CPU cooler. 

4: PSU: quality PSU with at least 20% more rated power than your system ""requires"". Generally 450-550W minimum if you have a discrete GPU. 80+ Bronze rated or better is recommended. 

5: everything else. Motherboard, RAM, SSD/ HDD, DVD, case, keyboard, mouse, wireless card. None of these choices will affect the gaming-specific performance except that an SSD will improve general snappiness of the system and decrease load times in many games. "

Haran999,pics,1390855355.0,"I visited Bhutan during their first democratic elections some fiveish years ago. And I remember the guide telling me that everyone was pretty much against democracy before then, “Monarchy had worked for a thousand years, why break with tradition?” But the King had been adamant and really pushed the whole idea through, so they were going to have their elections.

Apparently to make this whole election thing work people had to give their vote in the town they were born or registered or something, only most people didn't actually live in those towns anymore, they had married and moved away. Secondly Bhutan is in the Himalayas and has got like two real roads in the whole country, one from east to west and one from north to south. So people would travel in large groups on top of trucks over the mountains from one city to another and then basically walk from there to their home village. Some people traveled for up to a week just to get home and vote. Being the first elections ever Bhutan funnily enough had no real politicians; they had village leaders, teachers and a very few people with foreign degrees, but no real politicians. One way or another though they managed to divide themselves into a green and a blue party of sorts if I remember correctly. They even had some posters, because what is democracy without posters? But being Bhutan the posters were of both parties, not one or the other.

On election day itself there was an armed guard present and even some UN inspectors with clipboards and blue hats all looking on very seriously as this line of very solemn mountain folk, almost all in traditional garb similar to the one in the picture, stood in an hour long line to cast their vote in this tiny wooden building.

I think that was the best part of my trip to Bhutan, I went there to see a country lost in time and ended up seeing a democratic election instead.

ArcFurnace,askscience,1390855399.0,"Wanted to plug [Project Rho](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/), a site with lots of interesting information about spacecraft design.  The [Basic Design](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/basicdesign.php) page even has a picture of the heat radiators on the Space Shuttle (do a CTRL-F for ""heat radiator"" and go to the last hit).  They're on the inside of the cargo bay doors, which are always kept open while in space- without any other systems running, you still have to reject the heat produced by the life support and even the crew themselves.

Another note is that heat rejection by radiation is enormously less efficient than heat rejection by convection- if you wanted to build, say, a 1-gigawatt power plant in space, it would need incredibly large radiator panels.  If you let the panels stay at a hotter temperature, you can reduce the size by quite a lot (heat rejected by radiation scales with the temperature of the object to the fourth power), but it also makes the power plant less efficient (efficiency of heat-engine power plants is affected by the temperature ratio of the ""hot side"" and ""cold side"" of the plant, with the radiators being the ""cold"" side in this case).  This is one reason why solar panels are popular; they don't have nearly as many issues with waste heat, since they're not heat engines.

That being said, women love my butt, legs, and forearms. I have been groped a few times, mostly by drunk women.

Try taking the stitch off the needle then pulling the yarn through, rather than pulling the yarn all the way through then taking the stitch off. When you pull a stitch off, check it to make sure it doesn't look tighter than your knitting and adjust if needed.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390855579.0,"I agree that lack cheap and easy of birth control is not the only contributor to poor women having children.

I grew up in some poor areas.

People get married young and have kids young. And while birth control isn't given out, and in many ways is discouraged, I wouldn't put it as the first issue.

But I think ""because they want them"" isn't accurate either.

I think it is more accurate to say ""they don't see any other real options for their life and choose to be happy about having children.""

The girls (and many of the boys) I graduated high school with didn't see many other options than having a family/children. None of their family members, or people in town were ""career people."" There weren't other dreams to be had. Not getting married or not having kids just isn't done in that community.

As far as having kids without marriage, which I gather the book is about, of the dozen or so girls that became pregnant in high school that I knew, the first pregnancy was usually ""a mistake"" they would have liked to have avoided, but then embrace. Because, of course, they were going to have kids and be a mom. Doing so early can be seen as ""getting ahead."" Sort of like if you wanted to go to college and can do it at 14 instead of 18, you're ahead of the game. And having other kids soon after is about building the family they want, by having their kids close in age."

HeadCornMan,premed,1390855605.0,"I've spent a lot of time shadowing, all of which has been in the OR so I can give pretty good insight there:

1) You'll have to wear scrubs, which you'll change into before going to the OR so to me it really doesn't matter what you wear. I knew all the doctors I shadowed so I wasn't too concerned with looking professional for the 60 seconds before I changed, but that's really your call. You've been in a medical clinic as a patient before so you know what doctors typically wear in that setting, so khaki's, button down, and nice shoes would be my go-to there (maybe a tie). Back to the OR, literally wear the most comfortable shoes you own. I've seen surgeons operate in Crocs, I wear tennis shoes with the mother of all arch support and my feet still hurt at the end of the day. EXPECT TO STAND FOR HOURS.

2&amp;3) I'd say shadow as much as possible. I learn new things every single time I'm in there.

4) Stay away from the sterile field as though your life depends on it. Sterile things are usually blue (towels can be green). I don't necessarily agree with the not asking surgeons questions, so long as they aren't actively cutting away. My pro tip here is to make friends with the anesthesiologist. If you're shadowing a surgeon, ask him if you can go watch the patient be anesthetized and talk to the anesthesiologist. It's interesting and he might let you stand by the anesthesia machine which gives you the best view outside the sterile field. Also, he's a good person to ask about what's going on during surgery while the surgeon is busy; he's a doctor and knows what's going on, but really isn't so busy once surgery begins.

5) Only get a LoR if it was long term (ask at the end), otherwise they really can't write a strong one. I do think it is appropriate in such a case though, but make sure they can write a good one.

6) These are the big ones I've learned in a ton of shadowing time. Feel free to PM with any more questions."

Aleysia,OkCupid,1390855628.0,"I completely agree with you from a logical perspective of how it would be *better* for humans to operate, but you need to also come to terms with how humans *do* operate. Namely, feelings are important, and we are always strongly influenced by them even when we think we're not. We can and should try to be aware of it, make decisions more rationally, etc., but you're never going to get rid of it. I'm sure you still have a minimum level of physical attraction you're willing to accept?

Character and constant personal growth is extremely important to me, and it's something I look for in potential partners, as well as a major point of attraction. That said, I couldn't ever base a romantic relationship on that alone. There has to be more, or the relationship ends up feeling like being roommates with a business partner. It might work if there turns out to be emotional/physical chemistry, but it also might not.

I know where you're coming from, and I agree that feelings are not to be trusted unless they can be backed up with reason. But they're still an important part of being human, which is something I've had to come to terms with myself.

As for the original question about the elusive ""spark"", for me personally, it's about things like natural understanding and ease communication, shared sense of humor, mutual appreciation/respect, and the ability to intellectually stimulate each other. Unfortunately, these are things that either are or aren't there -- if we have very different ways of thinking then we're obviously not going to instantly understand each other, if we don't find the same things funny then we simply don't, if we have different values then we may never fully appreciate each other, etc.

sleepyj910,Parenting,1390855719.0,"Well, sounds like a lot of mental issues, therapy for everyone!  Certainly your mom seems narcissistic, or at least very insecure.

Anyway, I'd just continue to message your mother, and ignore your stepfather.  'i love you. i miss you.' should be the point of the message.  If she can't handle direct confrontation of her mental issues, then you'll just have to let her be and hope that kindness wins in the end.  

Don't pressure your mom to be anything, just try to enjoy her company if she's willing to let you, and if you want to talk about your feelings, fine, but don't pressure her to do so, or direct conversation that way, she'll only feel defensive because she's not mature enough to handle her own emotions.

Basically, you have to treat her like a child, and validate her emotions as much as possible.  She has the right to feel what she feels, even if it's irrational to you.  If you validate her, she may be able to move past it.

Focus on the present.  ""I'm here now, I want to support you, I want to spend time with you.""  Don't disagree or criticize, change will come from within her, not from you.  The closer you can maintain your relationship while she struggles with these emotions, the more likely she will ask your advice when she is ready."

You can keep these cars in the higher revs and really enjoy the powerband before having to slam on the brakes to avoid speeding tickets. In more powerful cars you can never really open up the throttle because you end up going too fast too soon. Even more, the gas mileage that the smaller engines provide is just awesome.

Gluestick05,TwoXChromosomes,1390855792.0,"Congrats on the job interview!

Attire-wise, it's probably smart to get a suit that matches in a dark, conservative color like navy, or charcoal.  Apparently in the fashion/""proper etiquette"" world, there's some debate over whether or not black is appropriate, but I interviewed in a black suit and 80% of the recent grads who come in for interviews are wearing black suits, so it's really not a big deal.  But definitely interview with a blazer that matches your bottoms.

If you fiddle with your hair like I do, make sure that it's tucked away where you can't touch it.

And on to substance...

Have 3 positive things that you want to communicate about yourself, and make those 3 points as often as you can throughout the interview.  Every question is an opportunity to demonstrate your main points.  Know what they are.

Research the company.  Be ready to ask questions.  When the interviewer asks ""do you have any questions for me?"" your answer should be ""yes!""

Prepare the standard questions ahead of time.  Why do you want this job, where do you see yourself in 5 years, how does this job help you achieve your future goals, what is your greatest strength/weakness, etc.  Don't get caught unprepared on questions that are asked in every interview.

And finally, make sure that you get yourself talking a little before you go into the room.  My first 20 minutes of conversation every day are horrible word salad slop.  I always chat with the receptionist or call my mom if I'm really desperate, just to get my brain into conversation mode."

Ralkir,changemyview,1390855920.0,"&gt; then what is the upside to tacitly accusing someone of infidelity?

I don't view it as an accusation. I view it as an opportunity to demonstrate trustworthiness, at the end of the day. So first a few things. 1. A baby substantially increases the risk of trust. There are financial consequences and as such, such a huge investment of money, I want to be the 99.99% sure. So even if I trust another person 90%. That's not enough for a huge investment such as a child.

Second. everyone lies. Every single person and even to their significant other. As such, I personally do not trust anyone 100%. And I certainly do not BLINDLY trust anyone by a significant amount, and certainly not 100%. 

A paternity test therefore should be 2 things. First to mitigate the risk of a financial investment to less than percent. Second an opportunity for a partner to DEMONSTRATE their trustworthiness. And that last part I find important. If you tell me that you should blindly trust your partner, then I'm sorry there is no debate to be had, I simply disagree. Blind trust is always wrong, people need to demonstrate their trustworthiness, and solidifying your trust in big matters such as this, truly demonstrates the level of trustworthiness a person is. "

bozbalci,progrockmusic,1390855927.0,"Well. I'm a musician and have a great interest in mathematics. When I first discovered progressive rock, the first thing I liked was the colorful world of prog, and next, the complexity. Like, the right lobe of the brain, and the left, y'know.

As I moved forward in years, I felt like the magic was slowly draining away. By 1979, Genesis had already released ""... And Then Were Three ..."" which I found absolutely colorless. Yes's work was equally emotionless by the time. The 1980s, as you said, the new wave/pop scene, was full of make-up. It was made to look beautiful. They tried really hard actually, just look at the entire pop scene, everybody is trying to make it look beautiful.

And this is, in my opinion, something that we've yet to take away from our music. It's everywhere. Pink Floyd's ""The Final Cut"" isn't powerful emotionally, just compare it with ""Animals"". Genesis, for example. We all know how Gabriel used to sing the opening line to ""Dancing With the Moonlit Knight"", we all know how strong it sounds. Then Genesis made ""Calling All Stations..."" which I find extremely boring.

Then? Steven Wilson's music grows to be very sterile and too ""forced to be depressive"". Dream Theater lacks honesty. Everything becomes so colorless. I've listened to Spock's Beard's ""V"" and it sounded nothing colorful, compared to the ones I've listened from the 1970s.

So the main complaint here is that, newer prog doesn't include the essential components that made me like prog. I might have been decepted. Perhaps newer prog IS prog but I couldn't see the elements that make it so.

dorye,AskWomen,1390855957.0,"I just wanted to add that if you feel ""burned out"", a good idea would be to go see your doctor and rule out anything that could cause you to feel lethargic. If your body lacks some nutrients, for example vitamin B12 or iron, it might seem like you have to work ""harder"" to achieve some daily tasks. These deficiencies are easy to detect and correct. 

I had a deficiency in B12, along with a horrible job and relationship. I'm sure they all contributed to my burn out a few years ago, and I did not have the energy to deal with anything at that time. I quit my job, said bye to my bf and took a 6 week trip to a sunny place (it was winter time). 

Inertia can be difficult to overcome at first. I find eating well and exercise in general help out, and I have a non-judgmental buddy to keep me accountable for gym days. When I go to the gym or cook myself a meal, I tell myself: ""I'm doing this for ME!"""

EOverM,worldbuilding,1390856037.0,"The Encounter War ended pretty decisively.  It was a war between a warlike race known as the Edilath, and an alliance between the Uthelhux: a high-technology scientific race; the Obu-Kaph: a race of linguists; and the Damak: a race of archivists and historians.  The Edilath attacked out of nowhere with no prior contact (later discovered to be their MO when it came to first contact) and waged a devestating war that nearly wiped all three races out over the course of about ten years.  They were given a hell of a run for their money, as the Damak excelled at organisation and logistics, the Obu-Kaph were fierce warriors as they considered that the ultimate form of communication was to force your language and ways on others, and the Uthelhux provided ludicrously powerful weaponry and equipment to fight with.  However, there were simply more of the Edilath, and they were far more brutal and unstoppable.

With the Edilath fleet bearing down on the Uthelhux homeworld, they activated their last gasp weapon.  They called it something horrifically unpronouncable to a human tongue, but humans piecing together the rumours about it dubbed it the Time Cannon.  It was effectively a vast supercomputer capable of simulating the entire known universe at any moment in time attached to a wormhole that could have its exit in a completely different point in spacetime.  It simulated how the Uthelhux wanted the universe to be at a point in the past, then reached back and imposed this on reality.  No-one's sure how this was done, as immediately after they used it (and verified that it had actually worked), they destroyed the machine and all evidence that it had ever existed.  Only word of mouth and rumour still exists.

The Edilath still exist, but are more a constant irritation than a credible threat to any reasonably powerful race - part of the new reality was that the Edilath gained a more tribal nature instead of a monolithic culture (one of the very few races in the galaxy to do so), splitting their attention over different conflicts instead of piling onto one area.  Any race that isn't capable of turning away an Edilath tribe on their own is almost certainly allied with one that can, and so they're now like roving bands of barbarians - a nuisance, and dangerous on a small scale, but not really capable of wiping out an entire race any more.

The sinister part is that no record remains of what changes were made - we live in a universe that is completely unknowably altered, with no idea of how - or even whether - we were affected by this."

Is this something that men are doing to women or that women are doing to each other? It honestly boggles my mind because I do have very promiscuous female friends and I've *never* seen anyone give them a hard time for it.

All of that said though, I don't know if you've really disagreed with the OP. You've added caveats and added some nuance, but you've fundamentally agreed. OP didn't say that straight male privilege doesn't exist, he simply said that females have privilege in terms of more acceptance/fluidity in terms of sexuality and gender roles. 

You've basically agreed with him - you've just explained it from a perspective of 'valued masculinity' instead of 'straight/male oppression' (I realize I'm not using oppression in it's technically correct form).

See my other comment for information on why this is harmful and not helpful. It doesn't matter that you only do it sometimes or only do it a little bit. Even in moderation it is harmful, and I'm sorry but there is a ton of evidence to back that up. (Seriously. Spend five minutes googling it or see the information included in my other comment) My opinion really isn't extreme in the least. It's in line with every major conservation organization out there. 

Say you feed them in moderation. Then they move to your neighbor who also feeds them in moderation and so on and so on. Do you not see how the effect of that stacks? It's simple: don't feed wildlife. It's bad for them. You're harming not helping.

EDIT: I just want to point out that you are being willfully ignorant on this matter. Conservation occurs *everywhere* and you are not a special snowflake who lives in a bubble. The choices you make affect your ecosystem which affects the ecosystems surrounding it. Please, I beg you to take time, read the links I have sent you and understand that feeding wildlife is wrong.

i_lick_telephones,education,1390856198.0,"Personally, I'm not a teacher, but I would like to be a professor in the coming years, and I would definitely use this model of teaching in my classrooms. It's so much more of a dynamic learning system that humanizes the roles of both the teacher and students. I think it makes students more passionate about the subjects when they're apart of it.

I think it is less practical to incorporate at the very young age levels, because foundations of education and getting socialized properly are important. But I think this emphasis to use critical thinking skills could still be used at these levels. For instance, instead of having the children memorize things and just ""knowing"" and being able to repeat multiplication equations, have them truly understand what it means to multiply so it's applicable to real world situations and it's better understood."

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1390856200.0,"&gt;You inserted yourself into a boyfriend-esque position with knowledge that she already had someone fulfilling that position

Really, I inserted myself? She didn't have a say in this? Even your language is biased to marginalize her responsibility.

You can argue all you want that providing friendship, compassion, and tenderness is somehow a breach of the boyfriends rights, but the fact of the matter, is that I was building a relationship with her, not him. Like I said before, her relationship is her business. If I had swooped in and emotionally manipulated some naive girl into having sex with me so that she felt guilt ridden and used that to get her to break up, that would be one thing, then I might be an asshole because my intent would have been selfish with no care for her well being.

But what I did was offer a connection and companionship that her boyfriend wasn't giving her, and when she realized that she would rather be with me, she left.

You can keep telling me all you want that society doesn't approve of my actions, but you have three things going against you. 

First your arguing that building a social connection with a girl is a betrayal of her boyfriend disempowers women, and also imposes a standard that women in relationships should be isolated and not allowed to have close friends of the opposite sex. 

Second you have no idea what the relationship was actually like... Comemichiamo is probably convinced that I just showed up and started fucking her based on the way he has been responding, but maybe we never even kissed while she was with him... I haven't bothered to clear up that kind of misconception because it really doesn't matter because she was responsible for herself, and me for myself. I don't have a moral obligation to someone I have never met that somehow limits who I can be friendly with.

Lastly and perhaps most importantly, a relationship and the rules of that relationship are created by the people involved in the relationship. There are some relationships with three people, some that are open, some that are very exclusive, some where kissing in public is great and others where no public displays of affection are allowed. There isn't a single recipe for a relationship and in this case I was developing a relationship with her, and she with me, and the rules of it were up to us to write. And personally, I thought her timing for breaking up with her boyfriend was just about perfect given the way things developed between us.

So you can tell me all you want that your rules for my life are right, but frankly, I don't give a damn. You don't have to approve if I smoke, or drink, or get a tattoo, or if I have a relationship.

And frankly since I never gave you any details about the relationship other than we started as friends and grew closer until she broke up with her boyfriend and started dating me, I am inclined to see any criticism as ignorant, narcissistic, and judgmental of others for the sake of feeling good about yourself."

ANewMachine615,NeutralPolitics,1390856310.0,"&gt;What can be patented: I think changing what can be patented could help. Programming algorithms come to mind. As a programmer when I program it is much like when I write an essay using words from the English language. When I encounter a problem, I start to think ""how can I overcome this problem"" and I start programming. I don't have the knowledge or time to go look and see if someone has already patented the technique I am using. This is much like someone patenting a simple phrase in English. Such as ""open the door"". I can no longer say the words ""Open the Door"" in anything I write again because, it has been patented.

Patent subject matter is incredibly murky, and IMO needs a revisit from Congress in any event. The modern standard is basically ""whatever you can get away with, until SCOTUS tells the Federal District that it's wrong again.""

ladycousland,dragonage,1390856350.0,"It's absolutely worth playing. As others have pointed out there are definitely some gameplay issues but from a purely storytelling perspective it's one of my favorite games. The scope certainly isn't as epic as it is in Origins but I loved how the three-act structure allowed you to follow your character and companions over the course of about a decade and often forced you to deal with the consequences of your decisions. Plus there are just some great companion characters whose banter makes it all worthwhile.

Someone else posted that they believed the over-arching plot was weak, but I have to disagree somewhat. When I finished DAII it felt like, in conjuction with the events of Origins, a massive setup for the next game. IMO this is not necessarily a bad thing - without getting too spoilery, aspects that made up a small part of the plot of Origins become bigger issues as the years progress in DAII, and after Act 3 the stage is clearly set for the main conflicts of the next game. I really think DAII is vastly underrated and is definitely worth a shot."
ctesibius,MachinePorn,1390856350.0,"Do you mean to reduce vibration? Firstly, you may choose not to do so. An example would be the Laverda 3C engine. Assuming you do want to counterbalance the vibration, it depends on whether you space the crank throws at 120 degrees, or at 180 degrees. 

At 120 degrees most of the vibration is a rocking couple from end to end, so you can counter it with a shaft rotating at engine speed in the reverse sense, parallel to the crank, with a counterweight on each end. As the end piston goes up, the counterweight on the shaft at the same end should be going down. 

With a 180 triple, it may be easiest to make the centre piston weigh twice that of the other pistons, scaling the con-rod appropriately. That leaves only secondary vibration (i.e. at twice engine revs) due to the finite length of the con-rods - basically the piston reverses direction faster at the top of its throw than at the bottom. To counterbalance this, you need two counter-rotating balance shafts running at twice engine frequency with one lobe on each.

If you just meant ""how do you keep the engine running"" - same as for a four. You use a flywheel if the crank doesn't have enough rotational inertia."

Ponder is done, it's over. If you guys were correct and he had any chance at still being a prospect, don't you think someone else would be saying it?

You were.  Men with HPV have one very important symptom (besides the problems it causes to their own health): they can transmit it to women who *don't*.

A lot of mixed opinions on the matter. Some even believe that gay men are more masculine than heterosexuals (because supposedly society allows them to be so, while shaming hetero men). 

I actually see a shared theme between the manosphere and gay men. When gay men I've known came out of the closet, many of them *actively* embraced their sexuality and many of the stereotypes (even negative ones) about them. Some of them cross-dressed, their use of language and tone, tastes in music, and so on. Maybe the sudden freedom they felt coincided with an urge to express a fat ""fuck you"" to society for pressuring them to suppress their sexuality.

This is similar to many in the manosphere who've felt their sexuality suppressed, but after coming out of their own closet, give society the finger while embracing every stereotype (including negative ones)."

In addition, not that it is a great sign her first instinct is to hide from a potentially awkward situation and hopes it goes away, but she could have still done much more to show you some respect while still avoiding confrontation. For instance, instead of asking you to leave, why not just text you saying ""OMG Bob is here. I am making a B-line for the exit. Meet me outside in 5 minutes"". Instead she told you to go so she can just ""run into"" Bob there. They probably had an impromptu date with the rest of the evening.

In an OCD brain, the question is not overwritten, like it's on a read-only sector of a hard disk. Even though you remember that you checked (the memory of checking is stored elsewhere) the question remains. We're then compelled to check in an effort to resolve the question, but once again there's a write error and the question remains.

So overcoming the compulsion to check amounts to trusting your memory and ignoring the false alarm that the door is unlocked.

Not sure if that metaphor will help you at all but it worked well for me."

MaximilianKohler,MensRights,1390856629.0,"&gt; Yet you claim that they fight for equality. However you have just admitted that they only fight for those issues in so far as they apply to one gender.

Yes, I do admit to that... that's why it's called feminism and not ""gender equality"". They were trying to bring themselves up to the level that men were at. They wanted to be equal to men.

&gt;Also, women starting out at a disadvantage is an assertion that feminists have never proven. Women and men were treated differently but that's not the same.

Well that's subjective so you can't ""prove"" it. The goal is to be treated the same as men.

&gt;I didn't ask what you would say, I asked what IS the one true feminism. Where is your objective criteria that we can use to measure such a thing. If you have no objective criteria of what makes a feminist a feminist that we can objectively point to, you cannot honestly say that they are not feminists. Your argument, as you lay it out, is that they are not feminists simply because you don't like what they say or do. A lot of them would make the same claim with regards to you.

Well I would say the objective criteria is to be treated the same as men, and that what separates extremists is that they fight for domination/control rather than equality.

But I guess I agree with you also, since it seems like feminism may not be that well defined.

Martian Manhunter's ability to read minds will do little good when our heroes don't know which mind to read, or what they're looking for. And Wonder Woman's lasso (it can brainwash now? Huh, I guess the writers needed to give her something to compete with Superman's power creep) isn't something I'd suspect would help over distances, or when our heroes aren't sure what would make for the most effective ""brainwashing"".

For example, 2s aren't punishing themselves, but if one 2 rejects an offer another may accept it. There is no benefit for the 2 rejecting the offer, that 2 is only harmed, because they still have no money, while the 2 who took the low offer now has money, however little it is. The point of banding together is so that there won't be any 2 to take that low offer and the Player 1 will have to increase the offer.

Ninjatree,pics,1390856831.0,"That isn't what I'd call an objective paper, due to the rhetoric it uses. 
Either way, arab nations don't give two shits about palestinians, they just use the conflict to push their agenda.

Arabs hate america? Egypt is kept afloat thanks to american tax payer money, keeping it away from the blood bath now present in Syria. 

I like this quote from the article:
""Israel remained in occupation of south Lebanon for the next eighteen years until driven out in 2000 by Hizballah guerrillas -- whom the United States still insists on calling ‘terrorists’.""

Hizballah is now helping Assad, with boots on the ground to create the image OP posted. Not to mention that Hammas itself, the palestinian party that controls Gaza, denounced Assad and Iran cut it's tied with them. Mind you the clash with Hizballah didn't end with the withdraw. I'm saying that it is very complex and people who try to justify Arab hate towards America due to its support of Israel is just wrong.

Another quote: ""Not only has the United States failed to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, it has also built Israel up into the regional bully, and must therefore be judged complicit in its numerous assaults against its neighbours.""

What? Israel since the day it gained independence was attacked by its neighbours, and won, and gained ground. Multiple times major arab countries tried to destroy Israel and failed. Israel and the US brokered peace with two Arab countries, and always talked about the possibility of making peace with Syria. Don't see why Israel should be apologetic here. When Arab nations saw that conventional warfare doesn't work with Israel due to its military might, they turned to funding terror, which is faceless. And now you have countless terror group getting funding from whomever has some interest in the game (Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia).

Terror backfired and now its bloody murder all across the middle east. With Israel (and Jordan) being least bloodied by the chaos.

*Skyrim* is my first choice. It is a huge open world single player game that is set in a fantasy universe (magic, swords and bows, dragons, etc) that you can explore in any way and order you see fit. Lots of different things to do besides killing (crafting, exploring) and very intricate storyline and details. It does not have multiplayer (no online/offline with friends) and is totally in his age range in terms of maturity. This game is popular enough where he has probably heard of it, perhaps casually mention it to him and judge his reaction. It is available both on PC and PS3, but his PC would have to be somewhat powerful to run this game.

*Rust* is a sandbox game for the PC, in the sense that you build stuff and survive (like minecraft) but also has various guns and technology that go beyond minecraft itself. The game is centered around building a fortress with teammates, surviving, and accomplishing endless variety of goals. It is only enjoyed online and with other players (similar to Team Fortress 2), so he would be interacting fairly closely with others online.

*Terraria* is a two dimensional (think old school Mario) game for PS3 and PC that gets a lot of inspiration from minecraft, including crafting, building and surviving. The lack of a third dimension is enough to differentiate itself from minecraft, but might be too similar if he plays minecraft as much as I do! (Can also check out a similar game called *Starbound* for PC which further differentiates itself from minecraft)

In that case, a 30 is most definitely an option, as is a 32.  If 31.5 is truly snug, 32 is probably what she wants, but with a BTT of 29, 30 is not out the question at all, in my opinion.  

In case you haven't seen it, [Shaytom's great survey round-up blog post](http://abrathatfits.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/underbust-band-size-relationship-an-analysis/) about this very subject backs up my thinking pretty well.  In addition, the smallest BTT in the survey that wore a 34 band was 30 inches, so I'd think going up to that size would lost likely compromise support, especially as sodapopchicka could very well be verging on the G+ range in a 30 or 32.

Start your own company at 16, and put your time/energy into a major advancement in your area of interest that occurred between the time you were ten and now.

This is your license to ""be that guy"" that earns more money than he knows what to do with by playing with stuff he'd be messing around with anyway. For most people, that involves some serious risk; however, knowing the future the way you do, you can be much more confident in early adoption, because *you already know how likely something is to be successful*.

sleepyj910,exchristian,1390856940.0,"What better way to suppress doubt than to warn against trickery?  Religion survives because it has these built in guilt trips that tell you to stop using your mind.

Do you think a holy book would ever say 'Feel free to ignore this, we're just guessing'?

True believers of any cause would rather believe that people leave the religion because they are 'tricked', as opposed to those people making rational decisions.  So what you are actually witnessing is the cognitive dissonance of the early biblical writers.

And keep in mind, the Apocalypse was supposed to happen shortly after Jesus died, so the early Christians that finished the bible in those years were very paranoid about being wrong since the world kept going.

I know the Pentecostals are heavy on the end times, though that's really a small fragment of Christian theology on the whole.  But rest assured there are probably many Muslim texts that say similar things(those who leave the faith have just been tricked, don't follow!!).

So this is a common trope of any dogmatic system.  Denigrate those who leave to preserve the faith.

And of course, why would a good God let you get tricked anyway?  He'd know it wasn't your fault.  [A great video on this here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iClejS8vWjo).

ha_ya,OCD,1390857082.0,"It's true, you don't want to be an enabler. Temporary relief from reassurance comes with a negative effect in the long-term, but it's also hard to quit cold turkey.

The stepping stone I made for myself was this: I would ask for reassurance about something once and only once. I would then focus on trusting that person's perspective. I would say to myself, ""OCD is clouding my thinking. This other person is not affected by OCD. I should rely on his perspective rather than what the OCD is telling me.""

One of the critical points in dealing with OCD is recognizing that the OCD thoughts are not your own. Most people OCD do not identify with the thoughts, so this is usually easily understood. The real work is in reminding yourself of this fact enough that it becomes ingrained in your thinking.

Since you need help until therapy can start, I would strongly suggest *Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder for Dummies*. It's a good introduction to what OCD is, and contains a section for helping someone overcome OCD. If you want a good book on cognitive techniques, I recommend *Brain Lock*.

Hope some of that is helpful."

That person pushed through all those feelings because they really wanted you to hear something great about yourself. There's not a lot of occasions where someone would give a compliment they didn't believe. 

I think the first step is believing that they feel that way. It's still not really believing yourself but it's closer, right? ""So-and-so said I look nice today. I don't know if that is true, but they certainly believe it is."" And if it is someone you trust/ care about/ are close with, then why would they said it if they didn't believe it to be true?"

That won't happen as easily now because guys that age are realizing that they don't have to worship a girl to get laid.  But even at her age she could round up a relationship with someone.  I mean if that's the real thing she wants more than anything, then the outcome of attaining a relationship is more important than the person it's with.  That's what settling is.  Outcome takes precedence over the means.  So in her mind she's saying she's ready to settle but I'm no so sure.

superior22,summonerschool,1390857250.0,"• You always shove the wave into the enemy tower when the enemy isn't there. Ahead, behind, even, doesn't matter. They're not there? Shove it! The reason is not only to make last hitting difficult for them. If they're not there the tower will kill the minions, making them losing gold and experience.

• When you're ahead and everyone on your team does fine you can freeze the lane and zone them out. As soon as they leave you push the wave into their tower again, making the tower kill the creeps while they're not their. If your team needs help you get the tower instead to put more pressure on their team overall. Personally I prefer to take the tower most of the time and go dragon, mid, whatever.

• If you already started to shove and they're back you shove it all the way. If you don't you allow them to freeze the wave just in front of their tower which makes farming, harassing more dangerous for you. Just push it to the end so the lane will reset once the tower killed the wave.

• Depending how far they're ahead you might want to get some more sustain like a second doran's blade and a vamp. scepter. If they get an item advantage you can't trade with them anymore and should play it safe and just farm as much as you can.

• This is a tough situation. If you're confident in your abilities you can bait some skills which will push the wave into your tower. Caitlyn freezing the lane for example, you can walk up to her and try to bait an Q out of her, so it hits a few minions which will eventually push the wave soon.

• Always play to the strengths of your support. Try to ""learn"" his game. If he plays aggressive you want to play aggressive too. If he plays really safe, play it safe too. Basically you focus on farming and free harassing while keeping an eye on the movement of your support. If he walks towards them position yourself to follow up if he goes in. Bot lane plays are usually initiated by the support, not the AD.

Granted, it's a very small spending cut, but cuts are cuts.

&gt;I don't understand ""socialize,"" in the context of government getting out.

Poor phrasing on my part, what I meant was less money would be being spent thus I'd be robbed less.


&gt;Again, what does this mean in the context of ""socializing public universities?""


Absolutely nothing. I was simply stating that I would prefer that if there was a complete separation of federal government and higher education but a move to simply cut spending and subsidize public university tuition would seemingly be preferable.

Taulon,CrusaderKings,1390857318.0,"It's not JUST about the troops, although that is a factor. There's also AI traits to consider and CBs. Ambitious people are more likely to try to conquer their neighbors. I'm not sure if the shattered world mod adds a special CB. If it does not, then that may be why no one is expanding, because no one has a CB on anyone else.

Shattered Balance is an option in Project Balance, part of the HIP. It allows you to give a bunch of AIs 3000 event troops and the Ambitious trait, as well as a CB against every neighboring county. This allows them to expand quickly over all the other counts. Granted, if you choose to take the event troops, you can expand even quicker as the player, but that will always be true, no matter what.

You can choose to give the event troops to a whole bunch of AIs and not to yourself for the extra challenge."

I wish the courts would come up with a definitive ""what is okay and what is not okay"" list. I mean, here are some interesting questions: Where did Gawker get the script? Did Tarantino give it to people? If he did, did he have those people sign an NDA? If so, and those people are the ones from whom Gawker received it, then Gawker is in the clear here and those people are the ones who must be sued.

The only way I see this truly falling down on Gawker is if Gawker literally stole the script right off of Tarantinos computer or something. Or if they bought it from someone who stole it. We may not *like* that, but that may be how it is. This isn't quite like buying a CD and ripping it and uploading it. More likely Tarantino shopped the script around and (maybe with or maybe without an NDA) and Gawker got a hold of one. In that case, I don't see Tarantino being able to make much of a case.

And, truly, if they are simply linking to the script as the article indicates, they are probably in the clear regardless, because they aren't hosting it. File sharing has been using this defense successfully for a long time."

ernestborgnine2013,AlAnon,1390857435.0," Wow do I ever get what you are saying. My dad drinks and my mom won't give up hope of him quitting.

Story time: I remember how my dad told my mom how he would never leave the town they were living in, because he wouldn't leave my sister (a meth addict at the time). I wonder whether that was the best decision for them to make because when my sister got help, she immediately said she wanted to leave their town because the only people she knows there are the wrong people. If they had left, they might have been able to provide her with a place in which to make their new start. Instead, they are in the same town and my sister can't move out of their house yet, so she is probably constantly tempted to use again by the people she knows in the town.

What I am trying to say is don't let what they will do affect what you do for you. The dysfunctional family is often such a mess that they can't tolerate one person doing for themselves. All efforts are supposed to support the alcoholic. This is what makes the rest of the family part of the addiction. 

I do think you owe your mom and dad the chance to hear why you can't be around them, however. That would be the best thing in case they do change and want to reconnect with you. They will know under what circumstance that will be okay.

I am in a similar boat by the way. I was trying to set some limits with my family when my mom clammed up. She hasn't spoken to me in about two years. I knew in a way that that would happen, but I was surprised at how the rest of the family stopped talking to me too. Sometimes calling the asking for what you need casts you as the bad guy in these unhealthy relationships. But if I could do it all over again, I would. I don't think I did anything wrong in setting some boundaries. I still feel guilt because they are both in ill health, but it's better than being in the midst of the depressing mood that the drinking and dysfunction sets.

(Setting boundaries might be a first step for you. Determine how often you could tolerate seeing them, and go from there.)"

Look above for a description of how we got started...Short story growing for 1 friend, then more appeared on our doorstep. laws changed and we had to go big or go home.

I am one that is not bought into formalized business plans.  I hated that in cube world.  They spent 90% of their time on the plan and 10% on execution.  I could complete a project way before others could get the plan 1/2 was done.  I am not saying don't have a plan, but have and idea of what you need to do and work towards that. The ability to resolve issues on the fly is better than blowing up your huge plan with something you  didn't see coming.

Starting the business was reliant upon building a customer base and building the infrastructure behind that to support them.  Medical Marijuana is different because you can only grow plants tied to the number of patients assigned to your center. Each patient will give your center 6 additional plants to grow.  So, as you can see it's different from a business where you just build it out all at once.

3months:  Bring in enough cash to cover the rent.  Recruit patients to allow for expansion of the garden. It was sparse in the beginning, but building slowly.

12 Months:  Have enough patients to build out 5,000 ft.  Made it.

5 Years: The dream was to retire in 5 years but that was a really ambitious dream. Although that's how dreams should be, the reality is probably 7 to 8 years. 4-5 left.

Exit Plans: 

A) sell business outright and check out of the game.  [meh] 
B) Hand over the reins to my son and partner's daughter[currently employees], or a 33% son, daughter, and employee mix with a monthly residual.
c) However it pans out the company will have more than enough assets to cover the great escape.

Investors from out of state are not allowed in the Colorado MJ industry.  They have a pretty closed loop.   Personally, my partner decided early on that if we could not make it without investors, that would not make it. No two people in this industry can seem to get along.  Most investor relationships blow up, as well as grower / dispensary owner relationships.  It has killed many businesses in this sector.

You can try out a Kaolin clay mask about once or twice a week, you can get a bag of kaolin clay on amazon or ebay for very cheap. One tablespoon milk to one tablespoon clay seems to be my favourite mix. Clay masks are good for SFs, enlarged pores, acne (the clay sucks up all the horrid stuff inside spots) and they are just really nice.

If your skin feels dry after the Stridex you can buy an AHA or a BHA gel (Paula's Choice is a popular brand for them. The products are quite expensive but a bottle of AHA/BHA gel can last you 6 months upwards.) Stridex has menthol in it which has drying effects.

You can try out oil cleansing (there's tonnnnnns of stuff on it if you just search the sub for ""ocm"" or ""oil cleansing"" also there's a sidebar link"". Honestly, when I tried out OCM for the first time using mineral oil...heaven opened up and angels high fived me.

For as many shootings/mass murders you *have* heard about there are probably just as many, if not many times more, that you *have not* heard about. 

[For instance, of the ""Top 10"" deadliest shootings in the United States, five of them happened before the year 2000.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/16/us/20-deadliest-mass-shootings-in-u-s-history-fast-facts/)"
MathewMurdock,IAmA,1390857607.0,"Alright I'm back let's what I can do.

1. The main difference I have noticed is that identical twins get more attention when it comes to twin studies. Such seeing if their is some kind of psychic link, examining how they develop in their life and seeing how they act in the few cases in which they have been separated at birth. 

2. How close in age are we talking? If it's a year or two then it's pretty different. Non twins have a different genetic makeup than twins. If one is older than the other then he or she will somewhat assume the older sibling role. With twins they about equal with who even happens to be more mature assuming the role.

3. Genetics is most likely answer. Modern psychology has gone away from the the Nature vs Nurture debate a little, it's now which one has the biggest impact and how they interact with each other. A behavioral scientist and a geneticist might have different opinions but they can both agree than each plays a role

4. Conjoined twins ( or Siamese twins) are incredibly rare in the first place, those who live to adulthood or even a few years old is rather rare. 1 in 50,000 births to 1 in 200,000 births, with only about 25% surviving. With conjoined twins it's interesting to see how they act differently even though they experience much of the same things. Other twins have the freedom to act separately. Not so much with     

5. There is some albeit mostly weak (IMO) and sometimes anecdotal evidence that some twins have a psychic link with each other. More info [here](http://paranormal.about.com/od/espandtelepathy/a/Twin-Telepathy-Best-Evidence.htm)

More info can be found, [here](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/epigenetics/twins/), [there](http://www.apa.org/monitor/apr04/second.aspx), [over here](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beautiful-minds/200810/straight-talk-about-twin-studies-genes-and-parenting-what-makes-us-who-w), [up here](http://umm.edu/programs/conjoined-twins/facts-about-the-twins), [down there](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-superhuman-mind/201211/identical-twins-are-not-genetically-identical) and [somewhere else](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study).

SlickKat88,Dreams,1390857722.0,"I haven't been keeping up with my dream journal as I wish I would, but I have been keeping an eye on my dream patterns lately (I've had a few that have kept my interest in the subject all these years). I've actually noticed similar things in my dreams that you mentioned. There's hardly any audible cues in my dreams, most conversation/interaction if others are around seems to take place in my head. When I'm interacting with people, it's as if I *know* what is being conveyed without any real information gathered. A few of the locations are the same, but again, I just *know* what's there, I don't necessarily see or make out anything minute except that which pertains to what is happening at that moment.  
  
Recently, somewhat out of nostalgia and a drive to try an external helper (I tend to lose motivation), I've been drinking [sleepytime](http://www.celestialseasonings.com/products/sleepytime-teas/sleepytime) tea before bed after about ten minutes of meditation. At this point, that simply means sitting cross-legged on my bed with the fan on for white noise background, and I just spend that time letting my imagination flow since I have trouble shutting my brain off. I'll picture a tree, and that'll somehow relate to a public pool, relating to a person searching for starfish in the ocean... anything but *thoughts*. I find it kind of liberating to let the images flow.  

Doing all of that... my dreams have started to organize themselves in a way. Like /u/PhedreRachelle said about eliminating mindless clutter to declutter your dreams. Specific moments of my dreams stick out, even if the rest is covered up, and even that is beneficial.  
  
Finding a small ritual that calms your mind, focuses your attention on the here and now, and engages happy imaginative thoughts (if you can't shut your mind off completely) - that could definitely help change your dreams up"

yingyangyoung,WTF,1390857758.0,"Welp, gotta add my friends game to the fucked up list.

How to play wingnut.

Materials needed:

A small room, preferably with durable walls made of wood or metal

1 screwdriver

1 Wingnut

An air compressor

Plenty of beer/booze

Preferred: eye protection

So the game is started by placing the wing nut on the screwdriver wing side up, you then use the air compressor to blow on the wings and get the wing nut spinning as fast as possible. The person holding the screwdriver then flings his hand up launching the wingnut, now spinning incredibly fast, into the air. You take a drink for every time you're hit.

* The weights are marked 1.0 for the one ounce and 1.25 for the one-and-a-quarter ounce. This is done because the weights have a tendency to fall off while the crew is prepping the tires (if you drop one and it bounces). This way, you can immediately see if a weight is missing and just replace it.  
* the small set of silver numbers above the word ""YEAR"" indicates the tread depth at five locations across the tire (see silver line above the pink number 43). Yes, i know there is no tread, but there are small holes across the tire that allow one to use a depth guage to measure how much rubber is on the tire.

This is a logical fallacy.  Millions of people are Scientologists.  Billions of people are Christian or Muslim, and I'm sure there is no shortage of any of these people who can make a similar claim-they felt something that made them stop and go ""woah"", and because they couldn't explain it, attributed it to God or whatever.

&gt; The constant consistencies can't be ignored

Nor can the inconsistencies.  Either there is one god who disguises himself as Satan, or God, or Zeus, or Jesus, or Jehovah, or (insert any of the thousands of gods) and gives people ""feelings"", or there is a simpler answer grounded in reality.

I think its the latter-people self induce feelings through belief, or desire to believe, or social influences. This has been proven time and again-the placebo effect is a famous example of this.  The brain is a very strange thing and one minute someone can feel normal the next there could be an overload of a certain neurotransmitter and suddenly you feel awash with Euphoria.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390858272.0,"&gt; It's funny because I see a parallel to TRP in the gay community

It might differ from place to place. I live near the Gay Mecca where a lot of people I know who come out of the closet, feeling the freedom and acceptance of the community, went through dramatic changes in their behaviour and attire. It might not apply to all gays, but for a few gay communities I know across the West Coast of USA/Canada, that's how things were.

It's just as how not *all* heterosexual men go through a dramatic metamorphosis, and not even all men in the manosphere do, but a lot do. It's just a thematic similarity I see. 

&gt; I meant more that TRP is a response to that threat which most straight guys face

It might be how some of them do, but it's rare, because the subject doesn't come up *that* often. Dwarfing homophobia by far is the disdain of feminism. You can sort by MRA posts, and a good chunk of them are anti-feminist. Homosexuals are almost never brought into discussions.

EDIT: One of the funniest quotes for me on trp was [paraphrasing], *""I wish I was gay, then I could be capable of loving someone capable of honor, and not be stuck with women.""*

Le_Pyro,ModernMagic,1390858335.0,"I've been playing a UWr variant for going on 9 months now, starting off with Control, shifting to a Geist-based list and now I'm on a more [midrange-y plan](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/tiago-uwr/). The primary reason that I'm happier with my current list over the other two is its success against GBx decks (Jund/Junk/the Rock/Ajundi/Lingering Jund). Here's where I see you as having problems

* You have exactly two clean answers to Liliana in your mainboard, and no threats that are able to come down and not just get edicted away (with the exception of Thundermaw, but good luck hitting five lands while facing down an active Liliana, hitting your land drops *and* dealing with what they're playing is incredibly difficult). 

* In this matchup you **are** the control player, you're not going to be able to out-aggro them because they have Goyfs to block, Liliana to edict away your geist and DRS to turn off your snapcasters/gain them life. It's almost never correct to let their bob live as your goal should be to 1 for 1 them until you can Cryptic command them out of the game. Most lists top out at 3 and unless they're under ~8 life already then it's usually not worth it. 

* I think you need to be running Rest in Peaces sideboard, they're amazing in the BGx matchup, turning off Goyf, DRS, Scavenging Ooze and half of lingering souls as well as being good vs Melira Pod and Living End

* Without changing your deck around pretty drastically there's no real way to close the gaping hole that is your vulnerability to Liliana. A competent BGx player will know that she is their greatest asset and will TS/IoK your Leak/Purge away before playing her. In addition, Restoration angel is awesome against Jund as besides Liliana and their 1of maelstrom pulse, they have no real way to deal with it. The way my deck overcomes that is through the addition of Blade Splicer and Izzet charm, as Splicer laughs at Liliana's edicts  and Charm leaves you not so vulnerable. Check out my notes at the bottom [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1u7fus/modern_gpt_for_gp_richmond_1st/) where I talk some more about Splicer/Charm.

* In addition your sideboard looks kind of all over the place. Modern is a game 2/3 format, in that if you don't have a sufficient sideboard for whatever matchup you're playing, you'll be fighting an uphill battle and being in some of the best sideboard colors affords us access to a bevy of options. 

1. Why do you have mindcensors there? I get that they're supposed to be ""good"" versus Pod and Jund, but they don't really present a clock. I tried them out in my sideboard (Tiago's original list ran them) but I never felt they were good enough.

2. Why the 1-of path? You run 3 mainboard, do you really need a fourth?

3. IMO if you were playing UWR control Sowing Salt would be better, but seeing as your plan is to tempo out the opponent Molten Rain is better here as it comes in against Tron AND UWR while also furthering your game plan with a free shock.

4. When does thundermaw come in? The UWR mirror match? Because you don't run Restos it'll probably run smack dab into path or mana leak and won't really do anything.

5. Do you really need both Pyroclasm *and* Supreme Verdict?

If you can get a community atmosphere going this certainly pays dividends for the whole group.  But I'd expect that tipping out disincentivises cooks, bus buys and dishwashers from doing a good job because they're getting this free money regardless of how good a job they do.  Again, though, if you build up the community aspect of it all, this all does work.


But I do disagree that waiting is the *easy* job.  That's the one that has to deal with the most shit I'd expect.  Dishwashing and bussing tables is pretty mindless and easy.  Facing a customer requires that you bring your best game.

I love your entire comment, particularly since it relates to all of the cross-displinary studies I did in my philosophy degree.

But what really irritates me is that the ""Stormfront copypasta"" isn't devoid of values. It's just as ripe with them as anything informed by feminist theory. In fact, it's all the more alarming for how it plays at a neutrality it obviously doesn't possess.

Honestly though, the anti-intellectualism on reddit when it comes to sociological and philosophical applications to ""real science"" is fucking irritating as hell. No bro, without acknowledging your own theoretical frameworks and making sure they pass the same sort of rigorous ""reality check"" as your so-called real science, you produce drivel.

2) You can ignore the flavor text if you want. You'd lose a good part of the fun, but you *can* do that.

3) While that's a problem, considering its coop nature, Eldritch Horror is pretty tolerant of players leaving in the middle of a game. You could either decide to keep that player in the game and decide his actions as a group, remove him and scale the game back if you're at the beginning  or count him as eliminated.

4) I found that it's a pretty simple game that seems much more complicated that it actually is. For the most part, all your players *need* to know is: how to do a test, what actions they can take and what they need to do to win. Again, considering the coop nature of the game, the more knowledgeable players (you, who will have read the rules) can help them."

If two Jew patrols bump into each other, they must have a dreidel battle on the spot, refereed by a non-patrolling Jew. Whoever wins the dreidel battle gains control of that territory. Now, at any point, the leaders, or the Big Noses can redistribute territories at will, or battle Big Noses in other parts of the country to expand their influence.

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1390858661.0,"You would be surprised at the budgets of some films, especially some of the indie films. Some films can be shot for under $10,000, others for even less.

Even then, if you manage to license your film to a TV network or streaming website, you may also make more money than you realize. 

In reality, a lot of those straight to DVD movies actually pay their actors but their budgets are still under $100,000 and thus a single network picking up the broadcasting rights would more than likely pay handsomely.

Some ""bad"" movies are also funded by the network ahead of time.

As far as e-books are concerned, self-publishing is extremely cheap. A friend of mine wrote a book and self-published it. She is on Amazon and the book is free quite often.

Similar interests at least for some things are key - you don't have to be the same when it comes to everything, but having things in common to talk about or do are pretty important.

I think being able to hang out without talking a lot helps as well.  I'm not saying *not* to talk, but if you can just watch tv together or play some cards without feeling like you need to say something every 5 seconds is usually a good sign.

The last really good friend that I made was through work - we talked a lot at work, and then we ended up playing pool or grabbing a bite to eat before work. I lived near work, so sometimes we'd meet up for dinner before he went in.  It starts mostly with talking about people at work, the bosses, the job itself, stuff like that...eventually things get a little more personal.

For instance, when I was ten, a kick-trainer for soccer balls became really popular. It was basically a nylon net attached to a bungee cord, and allowed you to kick a soccer ball without having to fetch it after. I'm sure someone who enjoyed soccer (or at least saw the value in that type of tool) patented that idea and made a fair amount of money off it.

I'm not saying you have to be the next Apple; be the next kick trainer, or be the guy who popularizes the rubber ducky, or any number of small household items that most people use daily. If you really want to know how to do it, read case studies. There's always someone willing to chart the path to greatness; the hard part is the guesswork and uncertainty associated with forging that path.

ANewMachine615,AskScienceFiction,1390858990.0,"A Doctor Device fired at a galactic super black hole. Though described as disrputing electron bonds, they apparently do far more than that, as the effect grows stronger with more surrounding mass -- meaning that it must also be annihilating at least some of the surrounding matter to break the bonds and expand the range of the effect. A super black hole would probably contain enough to wipe out a single galaxy on its own, but the effect would actually chain outwards from there as it consumed the entire mass of everything within the galaxy, perhaps allowing it to reach another galaxy. The disruption field could thus hop from galaxy to galaxy, potentially forever.

The interesting question is how fast the field propagates. It destroyed the Bugger homeworld in about three seconds, which seems quick but would be very, very long when you're covering intergalactic space. It's possible the remaining disrupted matter could re-coalesce behind the field before it reaches a new galaxy, providing perhaps another target for disruption and field-feeding energy."

I know nothing about brands for this equipment so I'm really looking for help and direction.  Here is my current setup:

[Living room view](http://i.imgur.com/pS7Hx15.jpg) - The floating cabinet will hold center channel + receiver.  Right now there is a PS3, Xbox 360, and an Xbox One in there, but I will remove the two older consoles.

Sometimes I can't figure out if all women do it or if I am just unlucky. Or if its a plea for attention. But I don't think I have dated a single girl that hasn't told me she was abused at some point. And, tbh, when you get told that by over ten girls, you start to wonder which ones weren't being honest. Because it never comes as forthright information, it's always a *reason* for something. ""oh, I do this because *I was abused as a child*"". And then, later, sometimes they even admit it was a lie. Why would someone do this? It seems...idk. It seems like one of the sleaziest things you could possibly do.

Notes: I am not saying women are liars, or that they are all making it up. I have sympathy in every case and try to console them. It's just..idk. It happens *a little bit too often* for me not to be a bit skeptical.

Or perhaps you're unlucky... let's not generalize too much. Your experiences are different, other people's experiences will be different still.

In both cases they get a reputation for being focused on short-term pleasures so some people write them off for long-term engagements of all kinds. This is not particularly limited to one sex.

DrStephenFalken,AskReddit,1390859444.0,"&gt;Servers are paid the least

Not true, if you don't make minimum wage then you get by state law nearly per hour what the cooks are getting. 

&gt;they earn more money than cooks by getting tips.

They often (90%) of the time earn more than the cooks often 3x or 5x what a cook makes. 

&gt;Of course, there have been nights when I go to work, it's slow, I have no tables and take home no money. 

See this shows me you are a true server. You're saying ""I take home no money"" but by law you're required to be paid minimum wage. So once again you're taking home money and about what the cooks are making. So that ""no money"" is what cooks are accustom too. But what shows me you're a server is that by ""no money"" you more than likely mean you didn't take home at least $80, $100, or $150 or whatever you needed to pay a bill that is due, or buy something you wanted, or have that money to put back. I have servers who will say ""I didn't make anything tonight."" But they're taking home $96 and my best cook is going home with $60 after staying over a couple hours. 

&gt;There is more to serving than bringing food to a table and talking to customers. It can be physically demanding. I have spent 11 hour shifts, on my feet the entire time, running back and forth between kitchen and dining room, carrying heavy trays, bussing tables. 

I know what it entails. But you also have prep people who have been on their feet for 8-12 hours. Moving thousands of pounds of food all day. You have cooks who've worked 8-12 hours and have been bending into low boys all night, sweating their balls off by hot equipment, heat lamps, grills etc all while carrying heavy trays of food and tubs into their low boys. 

&gt;It's not just the actual physical work either. You have to deal with the customers. 

True you do but saying ""we have to deal with customers"" is sort of a cop-out to me. The cooks have to deal with the severs, the management and customers as well if food comes back. My point is that we all have to deal with people. People at Subway have to deal with customers. People who work in any service industry has to deal with customers. Dealing with customers isn't exclusive to your job.

&gt;I have worked in restaurants for the better part of a decade, and I would honestly say that a lot of cooks wouldn't be able to handle dealing with guests. 

You would be surprised. I've had many cooks switch to the FOH or cross trained to serve and they do just fine at it. More often then not you see cooks acting the way they do because they're isolated and well frankly there isn't much rules in a kitchen. So they get bored staring at the same equipment putting out the same food. So they make their own fun they also have the crushing stress of not failing and orders stacking up on them like crazy. 

&gt;Of course, the kitchen always thinks the servers have it so easy and sometimes the other way around. Maybe you should move to the FOH.

I run a restaurant now. I know all about FOH. I've ran three restaurants in the past six years. I don't call myself a managers or Chef because I've always identified myself as a cook. It's where I started and what I'll always be. I'm a humble dude. I don't need a fancy title. But I know all about FOH, Bartenders and Hosts have it the easiest. 

&gt;Edited to add that another responsibility of mine is bussing my tables and resetting them. Not that I do anything other than carry food to people and chat about their day. 

You need to find a better place to work. We have table bussers for the resets. Again, I never said a servers job is easy. Read my OP again. But my original point n my OP that you missed because you seemed to get defensive about being a server is that I honestly believe *tipping out is a good idea it creates a sense of community and cooks are not compensated fairly without it.*

Could you stand for 8-12 hours with no breaks on a concrete floor with a super hard rubber non-skid mat in a 130 degree kitchen? While a 600 degree grill is at waist level or 30 gallons of oil sits in front of you at 350 degrees?. While heat lamps radiate of your shoulders all night while a steam table roasts your ass? While doing all of this you have to squat your body weight about every three minutes (if not more), and spin 180 degrees every 30 seconds or so. Then every 30 minutes or so you have to go and get a 40-80lb tray of food and slide it into a low boy? Not to mention constantly move to get out of the way of other cooks or bend at the waist to check on food in the oven. Don't get me started on dish washing the hardest job of all. Prepping is the easiest BOH job.

I run a restaurant I see all of sides of it and I've done it all. Cooking, prepping, and dish washing are harder then serving. Serving at my place consist of saying hello to guests while standing in a room that is 72 degrees on lovely padded carpet, walking to get drinks, walking to get a tray of food, walking to get drinks, walking to a get a ticket, chat with customers or put up with their stuff, then wait for the busser to reset and do it all over again. 

However, I hate when servers say ""I have to put up with customers."" Well so does an employee at Wal-Mart, so does the person making subway sandwiches. Your customer pain isn't exclusive to you is my point. Most servers stroll in at 4 or 5pm. Stand around in 70 degree room on padded carpet. Stand around and talk with other servers then start working when they get a table. The cooks, dish washer, and prep people work non-stop their whole shift and most have been working since 8am. There is no waiting for their last table to pay out, or standing around waiting for an order. The BOH always working be it cooking, cleaning, or fixing something. 

After over 10 years in the business and with the last 6 years running a restaurant. If I were to get demoted tomorrow and I could pick my job it would be lunch time server (if I was looking for an easy job) or if I was wanting money I would pick dinner time rush server. They're the easiest and most lucrative jobs in the business. "

* I keep cleaning supplies under the sink, find something in a squeeze bottle or spray bottle (with bleach if possible). Aim for the eyes and it'll burn like mace.
* If you have a lighter then look for flammable chemicals and make a mini-flame thrower or just dowse you attacker and chase them away with a lighter. (note that somethings like alcohol must be the right concentration to be flammable)
* Rip the electrical cord out of something (strip the ends if you have time) and plug it into an outlet. Fill sink and stuff in your biggest towels. When burglar enters bathroom make sure to announce that you will electrocute them (loudly), drench them using towel, and then hold out electrical cord in a threatening manner. Likely won't do an serious damage but will scare most people.
* If you can surprise your attacker (depends on bathroom layout) shower curtains or large beach towels can be thrown around someones head to block their vision.
* Sturdy shower curtain rods can be used as an impromptu staff.
* Some shower shelfs or curtain rods are pressure mounted with really strong internal springs. You might be able to launch one end of the pole at an attacker's face.
* Assuming you've never used it, that soap on a rope you got as a joke present will be capable of causing some pain if swung hard enough.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1390859589.0,"note: this comment is fiction.  do not take what i write here as descriptors of my worldviews or my tone of thinking.

People die all the fuckin' time, it's just that they rarely notice it.  Take my buddy Rob.  He, just like you, and me, and your mom, and your boyfriend, and your neighbor with the faggy pink flamingo lawn ornament, died last night.  But there he was this morning on my couch, puking his hungover ass into my sister’s latest handmade abortion from pottery class.

The apocalypse came like it always does… about halfway through David Letterman.  Rob’s and my favorite drinking game isn’t too complicated (take a shot of jim beam every time there’s a commercial) so when the earth made impact with the sun I guess I considered it a welcome distraction last night.  Yeah, it hurts like fuck when your flesh literally melts off your bones in the nanoseconds of dying, but when you gotta live with your own death night after night you kinda stop worrying about it.  At least you can drink yourself numb to Clorox commercials and Judd Apatow trailers.

See, Rob’s not “immortal,” he’s just your average, run of the mill douchebag.  Everyone I hang with sucks.  It’s a byproduct of watching people die all the time; eventually you want to start enjoying yourself a little.  It’s not like I didn’t want to watch my kids grow up, but it turns out immortality makes for shitty fathers.  Lisa didn’t want me around them anyway.  Another byproduct of living forever is everyone thinking you’re mentally ill.  I guess they’re not really kids anymore anyway.  Chris might look older than me by now.

If others like me existed it would probably be one hell of a cliché that living forever isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.  Nobody tells you the badge comes with “dying forever” in the fine print.  The world ends every day and the next morning you’re back at it.  People go off to their jobs at hospitals and Arby’s to be ditch diggers or architects, with no damn clue that they died 4 or 5 hours ago.  Let me tell you it fucking hurts to get reassembled every morning from quantum bits of information.  Most people think they’re sleeping, but let me tell you, your worst nightmare won’t come close.  The memories hurt the most.  Getting your memories manufactured feels like a migraine undergoing a root canal.  The worst part is that you know they’re all wrong.  

Memories don’t reassemble like bodies because remembering the pain of dying sucks way too much.  People wake up every morning with jumbled incoherent identities, thinking they’ve been living their lives for years.  I asked Rob what we did last night and he told me some tale about the “badass” time we had with Stephanie and Marcy.  I remember what he told me happened, but I laughed because it didn’t."

Maybe for the OP but certainly for myself finding people in person simply isn't a viable option. I am a very quirky guy whose passion is an online gaming community I run.

Cautiously_Curious,AskMen,1390859636.0,"As a person who is rather anxious, I've had periods of time where I've worried or wondered whether I'm every sexuality, deviant or what have you under the sun. However, I'm probably the most sexually vanilla straight guy you'll ever meet. I have no particular fetishes - a lot of porn categories kinda creep me out.

My problem was/is that I obsess in a negative fashion about things that I'm not and come up with some ridiculously convoluted way that I could become that thing. Combine this with being a very curious person in general and I'll find myself latching onto anything I find to justify these thoughts, like so:

* Read the wikipedia article about transexuality - Must be transexual.
* Clicked on unlabeled shotacon manga while searching the erotica section of website out of morbid curiosity - Must be a pederast.
* Haven't felt horny in a while - Must be asexual.
* And on and on and on.

Your boyfriend seems to have the same problem though in a far more focused manner.

All people have obsessive thoughts like these. You know that song that you can't get out of your head?

People who are prone to anxiety or OCD-like behaviour tend to have more of these thoughts and they tend to be more negative.

Of those, 2 were mutual pursues (1 gf, 1 ST), 3 pursued me (2 ONS, FB) and I pursued the other 3.

So similar to OP my date:success* ratio is quite even. They also came in 'waves' after the 2nd gf, i.e. after being with 2 girls in 2 years I then suddenly had 2 ONS and a ST within a 2 month period, followed again by a year of nothing and then 1 ONS, ST and (eventually) FB within a 1 month period.

Before my 1st gf (4 years ago), I had no success with women although that was largely because I gave up after I think 6 unsuccessful attempts within a 5 year period.

Since my 1st gf, I have not gone on dates which did not lead to success and I think I've only knowingly turned down 1 woman.

Oh and 1 gf, 2 ONS, 1 ST and the FB are taller than me. Tallest was a ONS at 4"" more, 'shortest' was 1"" more.

Your wife is evil...when did you realize this?  Is she in therapy or is this your personal diagnosis?  Is she on any drugs?

Anyway, he needs therapy.  Why the hell would she be against it.  Make it happen.  Especially if he's abused living creatures.

Sociopaths in a classical sense can be useful to society when they are focused on improving their lives instead of destroying others, since you can't get very far in life if you ruin everyone you touch (society will not tolerate you).  So if he really is one, guide him toward lawful evil, not chaotic evil, if you understand me.

Also, keep in mind that boys don't fully develop their frontal cortex until puberty, so it's possible he simply can't handle his empathic emotions yet.

Side note: I stole a bit around age 8-9, but one experience with the cops scared me straight.  I mostly didn't understand the harm of it at the time, since it seemed like adults had so much cash why would they miss it.  I did feel a lot of shame at disappointing my parents though."

**1) Intelligence:** I would say above average, but nothing extraordinary. I think I have good thinking skills, but my memorization is kind of poor. I do some research and read a good bit on a variety of subjects (though admittedly I like to be in my comfort zone of reading social sciences).

**2) Health and Fitness:** Slightly below average. I don't eat as much as I should, and when I do eat, it's not good for me. My only exercise is walking and yoga. I have a normal body weight though, if not slightly under.

**3) Emotional Maturity:** Hitting on average maybe. I think I'm right where I need to be. I try my very hardest to not let emotions overcome my actions, and I try to be in touch with my emotions. I am able to sort out what I'm feeling and address it properly most of the time. However, I still succumb to my anger and sadness or whatever, so I rated myself as average.

**4) Life in General:** Above average. I am not a victim of poverty, I am in generally good health, I have a network of friends and family who love me, I have a successful long term relationship, I'm being educated, I have traveled, I am surrounded by my hobbies, and I am on a good path."

If, like you say, you just haven't found the right woman, there's nothing wrong with that.  If you've been education or career focused and just never found time to pursue a romantic relationship, what's weird about that?  It doesn't happen often, but it doesn't make you a monster!

But if you start lying about things, making up people and past relationships, and then you start developing a friendship or even a relationship with this girl (or others, with whom which you continue to perpetuate these lies because it's just easier) then imagine what happens when they find out the truth.  It's not that the actual truth is weirder, it's that you lied to them.

I was dating a girl once and I told her my dad sold my bed.  We were talking about old furniture and what our parents still had, and I mentioned he sold something out of storage.  I didn't say, ""Out of storage,"" I just said, ""He sold my bed.""  She took it to mean, ""Out from under me.""  When she found out, she called me a liar and broke up with me (and kicked me out.)  Now, she was a little nutso, but just imagine you've built up a lifetime of, ""Well there was this one lady, and then this other..."" and then someone finds out that none of it is true.  What do you do then?

Honesty is the best policy.  Don't make shit up you have to cover for later.  Don't satisfy the rumor mills, don't feed into others' propensity for pointing fingers.  It sucks being singled out, but at least you aren't lying about who you are."

Putting Earl near the LOS versus Manning is *not* going to work. He'll have to be deep. So the key here I would think is to ensure that the DTs and Bryant stay energized and not get too tired. That temp article may have raise some prevalent points.  Although, we played NE at home least year when they have the TE party and welker and we survived the first half and corrected in the 2nd half, allowing 23 points total.

Speaking of the period 1754-67, Dr. Henderson, former Director of the WHO smallpox eradication program writes, ""British soldiers distributed blankets that had been used by smallpox patients with the intent of initiating outbreaks among American Indians. Epidemics occurred, killing more than 50% of many affected tribes.""

NORTH AMERICA: Biological Warfare against Soldiers and Civilians
During the American Revolution, the British army used infected civilians and soldiers - particularly black soldiers serving the loyalist cause in exchange for promises of freedom - to spread smallpox among the vulnerable American citizenry.

AUSTRALIA: Barbarism in Tasmania
The first British colonists arrived there in 1803 - 24 prisoners, 8 soldiers and a dozen volunteers. The following year the killings began. The first massacre was by escaped prisoners - they randomly killed the natives and raped their women. The more sadistic killers chopped off the head and asked his wife to carry it round her neck...In 1829, prisoners were sent out to hunt down the natives and a £5 reward was offered for every native caught...In 1830, a chain of 5000 soldiers set out to corner all the natives into a small space. For several weeks the chain moved across the whole island. In the end just 300 natives remained.

KENYA: The Mau Mau Uprising
""Dramatic evidence has unearthed such systematic British brutality in the former colony of Kenya that it may require the rewriting of imperial history. Hitherto secret files show that the then colonial secretary, Alan Lennox Boyd, sanctioned a policy of violence towards interned guerrilla suspects...The scale of suffering &amp; death was far higher than previously thought and the Kikuyu death toll could have been as high as 50,000 [for some 35 European deaths]"". John Nottingham, a district colonial officer at the time who stayed on in Kenya said: ""What went on in the Kenya camps &amp; the villages was brutal, savage torture...I feel ashamed to have come from a Britain that did what it did.""

BENGAL, INDIA: Bengal Famine
The British colonial masters used hunger and starvation as tools which lasted for about eighteen decades which claimed about 30 million victims. Bengal had 30 or 40 famines during 182 years of British rule in Bengal. The last big famine in Bengal occurred between 1942 and 1945. At least four million people died during these three years and the famine deaths were caused by British policies.

INDIA: British Indian Holocaust
1.8 billion excess deaths, 1757-1947; 10 million killed in post-1857 Indian Mutiny reprisals; 1 million starved, 1895-1897 Indian Famine; 6-9 million starved, 1899-1900 Indian Famine.

IRELAND: Irish Potato Famine
The British caused the genocide of 2 million out of 8 million Irish subjects in four years. When it was ""over,"" the British officials directly in charge of ""Irish famine relief,"" particularly acting Treasury Minister Sir Charles Trevelyan, congratulated themselves and were decorated as Queen Victoria made her gala 1848 visit to Ireland.

SOUTH AFRICA: Boer (Afrikaaner) Genocide
28,000 Afrikaaner women and children died in British concentration camps, 1899-1902.

IRAQ: British Suppression of the Arab Revolt in Iraq
British invaded in 1914. Bombing of Kurds using poison gas in the 1920s.

INDONESIA: A Million Deaths
Bloodbath in Indonesia begins as army moves against supporters of Indonesian Communist Party, reaching around a million deaths. Declassified documents show Britain aids the Indonesian army in conducting the slaughter through covert operations and secret messages of support.

OMAN: Military Intervention by the British
SAS fights covert war and RAF conducts wide-spread bombing of villages and strongholds.

NORTH YEMEN: Dirty British War
In 1962, MI6 and SAS begin covert operation in North Yemen that eventually involves providing arms, funding and logistical support to royalist rebels in dirty war against pro-Egyptian republican forces. Around 200,000 die in the war.

AFRICA: Gukurahundi Massacres
Britain was behind the 1980s massacres that left nearly 30,000 innocent civilians from Matabeleland and the Midlands dead.

GetOffMyLawn_,AskOldPeople,1390859969.0,"Let me preface this by saying that I am one of those people that stays super calm in the middle of a crisis and then later reacts. As the firewall admin for my company and with a dragon lady of a boss I was worried when our Internet thruput dropped to near nothing around 9 AM that morning. After 10 minutes of banging my head against the wall I walked over to our helpdesk to find folks watching the impact of the first plane. ""OK, I thought, that explains it, everybody is streaming video so that's why there is no response."" Then I watched the second plane fly in and immediately thought ""Terrorists"". Went back to my desk and went back to work. Around lunch time it really started to sink in, and by that time I had been able to read the news reports for myself. I felt sick. One coworker was so upset he went home. All our volunteer fireman were paged for first responder duty and left. I was mad that they wouldn't send people home so I could watch the news, other than the swamped Internet we didn't have much access to outside news. Too much metal in the building for radio reception. We used to be able to see the towers from our location, lots of people went up on the roof to watch the fall. I went outside later to have a look and saw only a column of smoke. 

At some point I remember thinking ""Too bad I lived long enough to see this."" I also knew it was going to be a major game changer. After the end of the Cold War a lot of people wanted to dismantle most of the military because they didn't think there were any serious outside threats anymore. Obviously it had the opposite effect.

The really weird thing for me was a week or so previous I was stuck in traffic on my homeward bound commute listening to the news on the radio about how upset the Palestinians were about the Israeli's use of Apache helicopters on them. And I felt the anger, a very cold, bitter anger of what it must be like to be on the ground when something like that flies overhead and shoots at you. A white hot chill of anger. And I said to myself, something bad is going to happen, it's going to get worse.

Also, in the 1980s I used to work  a couple of floors above right where the second plane went in. I often think of what it would be like to be sitting in the window where I normally worked and looking up and seeing a plane's nose just outside burst into the window. Also when I drove to work each morning I would see the towers, for months afterwards I saw the smoke every day. I still look at the place 87 floors up where I used to sit and think that I used work there in the sky. "

petrifiedcattle,worldpolitics,1390860039.0,"So you would be fine with corporations conscripting you to work in sweat shops and labor camps if they dictated it as a necessity for them to survive?  

The government is supposed to exist to protect the interests, safety, and freedom of individuals.   The government passing laws to extend vast amounts of power for corporations to impose restrictions on your life, whether you want to interact with that company or not, is unacceptable.  

Many of the proposed laws in recent years would have afforded powers to corporations that have outlived their period of usefulness and would have only served as a mechanism to hold back society from advancing through innovation and implementation of modern technologies. 

The thing I think you are confused about is that *corporations exist to serve the needs of consumers*, not the other way around.   If consumers reject the way a corporation does business, then it is time to adapt or die.  Netflix and Blockbuster are a great example.  Netflix built a better company for delivering movies to consumers.  Consumers liked it and stopped shopping at Blockbuster.  Now, if Blockbuster could have had the power similar to that which many of these policies are proposing, they could have found a way to make Netflix's business illegal, inaccessible, or cost prohibitive and we would all be stuck going to our local Blockbuster to pick out DVDs instead of streaming them directly to any of a dozen devices throughout the average household.

Canuck147,changemyview,1390860049.0,"Ah okay I see the perspective you're coming at for slut shaming in terms of victim blaming. Yeah that's pretty horrific behaviour. I guess I am just a sheltered urban Canadian. I have zero ability to imagine a nurse or doctor calling a raped girl a slut - to me that is literally insane.

All that being said I do want to point out one thing about victim blaming - I always see victim blaming being discussed in terms of rape, but that's always seemed like a bit of an oversight to me. It comes across as though blaming victims in rape is an instance of patriarchy (or something along those lines) and I just don't see it like that. Victim blaming is part of a larger culture of violence. Victims are blamed in cases of mugging (why were you walking alone? why were you wearing expensive things? why didn't you have better locks on your doors?), or homelessness (why are you so lazy? don't you have any pride?), or bullying (why do you let him walk all over you? why don't you stand up for yourself? why didn't you tell a teacher?), or cons (why did you believe he was  real prince? are you dumb it's obvious he was fooling you?).

I don't want to come across as dismissive of the truly awful existence of slut shaming and blaming victims of rape. My only point is that I think it's really important to look at victim blaming beyond just the scope of rape and realize that it's a general phenomena that needs to be engaged at a general level and not just from a 'patriarchy' or gender standpoint. Again this isn't to say that you're wrong - because you aren't - just that I think we need to broaden the scope of the conversation to effectively address it."

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1390860254.0,"There are some good indicators of overall market valuation (PE10, market cap:GDP).  Without context, they are useless.  OK, great, the PE10 is significantly above historical average.  What does that mean? Stocks are trading at a higher multiple than they normally do.  What could cause this? A booming economy.  Unusually low corporate earnings. Unusually high earnings growth (higher rates of earnings growrth typically correlate to higher P/E ratios as they produce a larger  future valuation in most models).  Great.

So how can we actually make use of these metrics? 

Here is an example of what a premise might look like (this is just a quick off-the-top-of-my head thing, no warranty of usability, may result in death and dismemberment and all that jazz).

Premise: S&amp;P is currently overvalued, and due for correction.

Support: 

* PE10 predicts 1.3% real returns from current valuation (http://turnkeyanalyst.com/2011/10/06/the-shiller-pe-ratio/).  

* Market Cap:GDP predicts 2% real returns from current valuation.

Verification: What do macroeconomic conditions that would impact the S&amp;P look like?

(old article for expedience/example purposes, do your own diligence) http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/09/business/economy/Higher-Profits-Lower-Wages.html?_r=0

Key points:

* Corporate profits ~50% above 50-year average, currently at record highs.  This means the 'E' portion of the ""P/E"" equation is the highest it has ever been.

* Wages as a % of GDP 10% below 50 year average, currently at an all-time low.  This indicates that most companies in the S&amp;P will come under significant earnings pressure due to deteriorating economic conditions.

Other info:

* Labor participation at lowest in 30 years, and still declining: http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000

In short, the mitigating factors that would suggest support for the current valuation (sustainable earnings and/or economic growth) are not only lacking, but in fact indicate a high probability of deterioration of earnings.

To support current valuations, we would need:

* Increased corporate profits.  This seems unlikely given that we are in the worst economic climate in 50 years, and profits are already at a 50 year high.

OR

* Increased earnings multiples.  This also seems unlikely, as PE10 is currently 50% above the historical mean.

Likely outcome:

* Reversion to mean of earnings.

* Reversion to mean of earnings multiples.

If we take today's 1800 S&amp;P price and adjust to historical averages on both earnings and multiples, we see a valuation of 770.

---

Do I personally think we'll see S&amp;P 770? Not likely. 

Do I think that we will see a major correction within the next 18-24 months? Absolutely.  Possibly even some point this year (although I'm hoping it takes a bit longer so I can stockpile more cash).

What do you do about it? If you are going with a standard equity/bond allocation model, rotating more heavily into bonds would be advisable.

What are the risks? Due to the nature of the markets, we typically see vacillation between markets being significantly overvalued, and significantly undervalued.  By getting out at the first sign of an overvalued market, you are likely to miss out on most of the gains.  

So how you do 'time' the market? Unfortunately, timing is the hard part.  It's generally very easy to predict which direction a market will move, but predicting WHEN that move will happen is much more challenging, as the ""popping"" of a bubble typically results from an external shock to the market, not internal market forces (this is why momentum trading is so popular among hedge funds, and so profitable... it's like inertia, and object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force).  The real question is, what is the potential upside vs. potential downside, and what is your level of certainty? Given the above information, it seems prudent to take steps to minimize equity exposure today.

Additional considerations include the unprecedented amount of market intervention by the Fed currently ongoing.  Is it possible that the market will continue ""to the moon"" as long as QE is in effect?  

--

I don't have all the answers.  I personally am continuing to DCA into a diversified 401(k), but am abstaining from any other equity investments and holding off on RE purchases to build up some cash to opportunistically deploy once valuations are more favorable.  If worse comes to worse and the markets go 'to the moon', I'll just buy more real estate.

Hope this is helpful in some way."

Aleysia,OkCupid,1390860261.0,"I deliberately engage guys that message me in extended messaging conversations for this reason.

That said, I realize most people don't enjoy this -- so I just ignore the guys that gloss over discussion and try to get me to meet them ASAP. 

&gt; I find the character of someone who takes the time to get to know those things far more attractive.

I agree, but unfortunately, this is the real world, and people HAVE to use first impressions to decide whether they want to continue to invest their time into getting to know someone more. No one has infinite time/energy/etc. and it's unreasonable to expect them to act like they do. And I don't say that lightly -- it wasn't so long ago that I couldn't really carry on a conversation with someone I wasn't already comfortable with, and it's a terrible catch-22, and prevented me from even trying to date. You *need* to work on that, and not expect everyone to make up for your communication issues with endless patience, because they won't. And it sounds harsh but... it's what I've had to learn, too.

Make sure your profile has all the stuff you'd really like to communicate, because that's where you'll have the most time to think about what you're saying. It will give people a glimpse of who you really are, and provide a springboard for the kinds of conversations you'd like to have.

I recommend watching it anyway, because it's an excellent film, but the plot is basically a group of soldiers in WWII on a mission to infiltrate a German base and destroy some powerful long-range weaponry that is causing trouble for the Allies.  There's the obvious similarity... and then intrigue, paranoia and betrayal ensues.

nicholasferber,AskWomen,1390860331.0,"Around 23 years old. The reasons were compounded.

I worked hard as a research assistant just before joining graduate school and days before joining I felt like I couldn't do it. I was drained and scared but I carried on.

Then being away from my awesome hostel life and friends in undergraduate, being away from my girlfriend (now wife), the dreaded calls from my mom where I got to know regularly about their financial, relationship problems etc took a real toll on me. I tried hard to socialize with others at my grad school but that never worked out. I was living on campus housing and most of the guys lived off campus. Also, I am not an american so perhaps there was a cultural divide. I expected to become good friends with my thai roommate but that never happened since he was strictly confined to his own thai friends who had been with him from high school. Its not as if people from my own country were that sociable.

I really don't know what happened because in undergrad it wasn't difficult for me to just go to some guy and start talking. I remember this one day when I was carrying a huge box of groceries on my own and it slipped from my hands and I cleaned it up from the pavement alone. So yeah, a few months from that I am falling behind everything, I don't know who to talk to regarding my choice in courses, about the course material and then I just gave up and went home.

What brought back my sense of drive was living with my parents for a year and a half which was hellish and I knew I had to get out of there. So I applied for grad school in america again, this time a bit closer to my girlfriend. (Btw, at this point she had been with me long distance for what.. like 2-3 years).

I was apprehensive about how I would do at this school which is quite high ranked but to my surprise everything was so much easier. Meeting people, course work, staying happy has been a breeze. The dreaded calls from my mom still come every now and then but I have learned not to let it affect me. I have to build my own life. I have two really close friends now, one russian and one chinese. I am happy now. Perhaps its because I get to talk to her every now and then and we meet often. She is working so she pays for the airfare :D. Oh and we married a year ago legally and married at home this December with all the rituals etc.

So yeah, now I am a month or so away from graduation and looking for a job so that me and the wife can stay together. For the first time in my life, I will have a home."

Personnellement, je suis ressorti de la salle secoué comme il faut. *Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre* me paraissait un titre un peu bizarre, mais après visionnage, ça correspond tout à fait au ton du film.                   

Par contre, de la part d'un pacifiste déclaré comme Miyazaki, je m'attendais à une critique un peu plus poussée du militarisme japonais de l'époque. On croirait presque hormis une ou deux scènes qu'il s'est refusé à l'aborder dans son film.                

Et puis, les personnages étaient vraiment attachants, ce qui rend la fin d'autant plus abrupte. J'avais envie de savoir ce qu'il était arriver à son ami ingénieur accro à la cigarette, ou à celui assez charismatique qui parait à un certain moment faire flirter le film avec des thématiques d'agent secret.                        

Non, vraiment, à part ces quelques regrets - après coup - liés à une impression de trop peu, ça a été un très bon moment."

League seems like there's never enough cc for certain champs and they just become unstoppable.

In all my games lately I've seen Kassadin snowball to legendary and carry one time out of maybe 10. The rest, kass may've gotten pretty built up but he couldn't carry.

Wanting to see what god-kassadin looked like I went on youtube and saw scarra playing him, but even he couldn't carry.

While kassadin is bad when fed, what assassin isn't? I have a much worse time with kha'zix. I went like 1/5 with khazix jungle the other day and ended up carrying like 10/6 late game, first time i'd ever played him.

Gay rights activists like to stress that gay rights are not a threat to the existing social order. I wish they were! A patriarchal, imperialist system that doesn't impart violence on gay people is obviously better than one that does, but it's a treatment of a symptom rather than the disease.

Addressing the article more directly, I do think it's fair to think that neoliberalism has appropriated and hijacked the gay rights cause, in order to transform it from a revolutionary cause to a status-quo-friendly one."

With that out of the way, my secondary favorites would be:

**Blazers** - The team i find most fun to watch right now, specifically because of LMA's post-up game. I love the position of PF and how he incorporates the mid-range jumper reminds me of my all time favorite Karl Malone.

**Pacers** - Since the days of Miller time I've cheered for the Pacers. Indiana is the beating heart of basketball and home of The Legend. I admire this Pacers team's emphasis on defense (shout out to Hibbs), and PG and Lance are two of my favorites in the league.

**Spurs** - Since probably 1996 I had never once rooted for the Spurs, until the '13 finals. They played with so much heart, and quickly grew on me. That, and Pop is probably my favorite coach in the league. Gotta respect that system.

Honorable mentions: GSW (because Splash Brothers), Clipps (because CP3), Bulls (because Noah and Thibbs). These all unfortunately have flaws that prevent them making the other list (see: Bogut/Jackson, Blake's whiny face, and an injury curse).

I vowed long ago to never cheer for the Lakers, but the fall of the Bean is making me waiver slightly. No, screw that, fuck the Lakers."

And in America, 17 states plus the District of Columbia now recognize gay marriage (and that's not even mentioning legal unions), where only a decade ago, *none* of them did.

Now, you might point to Russia and African and Middle Eastern nations who have passed harsh anti-gay laws, but generally speaking these are nations that one could quite understandably consider human rights cesspools *anyway*. And you could point to nations and states that have passed laws *banning* gay marriage, but these bans are very clearly a reactionary pushback to the increasing popularity of LGBT equality.

Things *are* getting better, on the whole. We're not there yet, but the anti-gay sentiment that still exists is only so loud because it knows it fights a losing battle. The screams of victory you hear every time an anti-gay law passes are those of a dying animal celebrating that it will live for one more day. But make no mistake - that animal *is* dying.

It may take a few years, even a decade or two, but if you have any doubt about it, just look up at that list and see how many places have embraced gay marriage, and know that those who have outlawed it generally didn't allow it before *anyway*.

At this point, it's not a question of whether it will happen but *when*, for every nation save for those whose problems are far greater than LGBT rights."

I've machined every aluminum alloy. Everything from 6061, 2524, 7085, 7475, 2219, etc and in all heat treat levels. The best you could do for surface that wouldn't scratch as easily would be a T6 7050, it machines well and gives a good surface. 7475 has a good finish too. These are tough alloys and they aren't cheap. A 5XXX would probably be the worst alloy choice so stay away from those they kinda get a foggy surface during machining. 5083 would be fugly. 2XXX isn't bad, 2024 out of these is probably best. 6061 is okay but not as pretty as 7050.

And I'm going to join in the group laughing at you for your tolerances. I use those tolerances in aerospace and defense, I'd sure as fuck not bother with those tolerances for cufflinks. And for 15 pieces? Dude, it's not worth our time to set up. Not at all man.

Oops!

Anyway, you're merely misunderstanding why I said what I said. The point is not what anyone is quoting, the point is nofap, and if Richard Dawkins had a ""nofap"" quote, he would be totally relevant to this subreddit. If the Bible has a nofap quote, then that is relevant as well. If you can't handle that, I don't understand why you would go on a public forum where tons of things are going to conflict with ""my"" moral values (By the way, I would bet money that at least half of your moral opposition to the Bible is because of a lack of cultural context or because of meaning lost when translated out of the original language, but that's besides the point). If there was a quote from the bible here about sexism or something, then I would join you in downvoting it. But if you want to keep getting mad no matter whether or not it is relevant to nofap, that's cool, I'll just take my leave."

These are like tiny bolts with a very small hole through the middle which is the first thing to get blocked up. They are usually cheap enough that it's worth paying for new ones, and if it won't idle reliably, this suggests that they are part of the problem.

The other jets will need cleaning, but probably best not to replace them. Don't let anyone poke wire through the holes - toothbrush bristles are less likely to damage them.

Fast-forward to a few months together and if I mention a guy friend, he's consistently suspicious of my intent.

I've been wondering about that, thanks for confirming!

DrStephenFalken,AskReddit,1390860990.0,"&gt;I also thought cooks got paid way more that wait staff.

This is a very common misconception. Because of tips waitstaff get paid more than cooks and by state law if servers don't make at least minimum wage the restaurant has to pay them that. I'm in Ohio our state min wage is $7.95. Most cooks starting in corporate restaurants around here start off at $8.50 an hour. Most after two years are making about $10-$12 an hour. Simply put Wal-Mart pays more per hour then cooks starting off make. However most of my servers make $80+ a night with the busy days I have servers making $150+ and it's not unheard of for them to make $300+ on the biggest nights for 4-6 hours of work. As where my cooks make $50 or so for a 6-8 hour night. 

&gt;But I'd expect that tipping out disincentivises cooks, bus buys and dishwashers from doing a good job because they're getting this free money regardless of how good a job they do. Again, though, if you build up the community aspect of it all, this all does work.

If the cooks put out food slowly, or make crap food the customer is less inclined to tip well so the cooks get less money from the tip outs. If you get hot food out quickly, and is nice looking and taste great people are going to enjoy their time at the restaurant more and tip way more. Thus giving everyone more money. The biggest aspect of it is that once a sense of community is established most (99%) of the people don't want to disappoint the ""family"" so everyone works hard. 

&gt;But I do disagree that waiting is the easy job. That's the one that has to deal with the most shit I'd expect. 

I never said it was easy. *I'm not saying their job is easy but IMO it's the easiest of all the restaurant jobs and yet they're paid the most.* 


&gt;Dishwashing and bussing tables is pretty mindless and easy. 

Not really, dish washing is pretty tough and often called ""the hole"" inside the industry. Dish washers are often the first people in the morning and the last people out every night. You have 200 degree steam hitting you in the face all night. You get wet and covered in peoples trash all night. You have to take out all the garbage in the restaurant. Clean all the plates, flatware, on top of all the stuff the cooks use, and then all of the removable equipment the cooks use. Like steam table and salad bar stuff. On top of that you have to bring plates and cook ware to the line. You have to lift super heavy racks all night. Unload the delivery truck three times a week and put it all away. clean all of the bathrooms, unclog toilets do stuff no one else will (jump in garbage can or trash compactor to fix it) Sweep and mop the restaurant every morning. Help with prep cooking if there's nothing going on in the morning. It's not easy job without them the restaurant shuts down. It's also why I pay my dishwasher more than my starting cooks and give them more vacation time then anyone else. 

Bussing is easier then dish washing but it still can be tough. You have to help dish when they get backed up. You have to clean tables every few minutes, carrying 40-80lb bus tubs through a busy restaurant. You have to sweep and mop most of the restaurant every night. Often they have to detail clean stuff like under the soda machine stations. Oil all the wood. Clean the dust from the air vents. Carry out garbage like the dish guys. Change light bulbs, fix broken tables, and chairs. Clean the floor drains out. Add water softer, help dish unload the delivery truck, get abused by the wait staff to run drinks or food to tables, 

&gt;Facing a customer requires that you bring your best game.

Yes and no, all you really need to be is attentive. Other than that you can cruise through most nights on auto-pilots. You can ask any server. It's like any other job there's good nights and bad nights. Again I'm not saying being a server is easy but it's the easiest job IMO of all restaurant jobs besides hosting. One of the biggest things servers can do that cooks can't. Is servers can often hid part of what they make and is often common practice. If you leave a server a $20 cash tip. More than likely all they're going to report to management at the end of the night is that they only got $10 on that table.

mmp31,politics,1390861393.0,"&gt;If this were true, recent record corporate profits would have resulted in record hiring and much higher wages in the U.S., but didn't. 

Why would it have resulted in that?

&gt;I would add that corporations cite low consumer demand for their reasons in not hiring the U.S. unemployed, an economic factor (i.e., demand) which is ONLY created by jobs that pay a decent wage.

What constitutes a decent wage is determined by what prices are doing.

&gt;One of the major problems we have seen for the past 3 decades is from Conservatives who unilaterally attribute inflation to higher wages. Nothing could have been further from the truth because cost of living inflation has been driven by business interests not consumers. After all, suppliers set prices, not consumers. If this weren't true, the cost of living would have fallen dramatically since the Financial Crisis due to falling demand, yet hasn't. 

Absolutely false.  Inflation is caused by only one thing - the rate of change of the money supply being greater than the rate of change of the size of the economy.  The money supply is controlled 100% by the Federal Reserve.  The Fed is the cause of any inflation we have, period."

I don't know that there's any evidence of anyone in this state actually getting offended by, or discriminated against, because of anything to do with brown bags, and, short additional evidence, am frankly in disbelief that this test actually existed in any substantial institutionalized form in any sorority or fraternity in real life.

Job losses due to automation is something that the government should be paying careful attention to. There's two different schools of thought on this of course: conservative and liberal. 

The conservative thought is that the worker should have chosen a different career or simply needs to work hard to get to another career.

The liberal (or social) thought is that these workers through no fault of their own are now out of a job and needs assistance retraining. 

Of course, if a government gives up on a particular industry through a free trade deal this really is no fault of the worker.

But the real point here is that a great story in book form is generally going to be superior to the same story in movie or game format, simply because *the reader is actively involved in generating what the world looks like*.

That doesn't mean great stories can't be told in games or movies. Braid was a very good game in this regard. Gone Home also engages players in a way that most games do not.

SirNuke,Steam,1390861923.0,"Wellll, to be honest, in my opinion the atmosphere and experience of L4D1 is far better.  L4D1 is a horror movie, on the creepy/survival side of things.  Everything is played fairly straight, and when it's silly it's because the characters are saying funny things to break tension (""An abandoned cabin in the woods? I think I know where this is going."").  It's hard not to fight through Mercy Hospital the first time and think about the chaos that went down and wonder if the world is ending.

L4D2 is flashy, goofy, silly, ""hey let's go fuck up some zombies!"" Coach wants a cheeseburger! Grab a frying pan and smack a midget zombie that rides people around! Fight through an amusement park with zombie clowns and set off a fireworks display to attract a helicopter rescue!  Which is fine, but it's a completely different feel.  In a lot of ways, I don't think it goes far enough. Furthermore, when L4D2 tries to be serious it lacks impact - the room filled with executed carriers, for example.

Even L4D1 campaigns in L4D2 are closer to the L4D2 style than L4D1.  There's plenty of improvements in L4D2's engine/gameplay, but I think at the core L4D1 is still the better game.  Now I wouldn't really recommend buying L4D1 anymore because no one plays it and has maybe half the total content compared to L4D2, but those are different issues."

Of course it's possible, but that's not what people are saying. It isn't about ""getting"" her, it's about keeping her. It's great that you cut your crappy friends loose, *but* the fact that you haven't been able to find/make new friends is a red flag. Romantic relationships take more work and communication than friendships, so it logically follows that you most likely will not have a great romantic relationship if you can't even manage a platonic one.

Also, as an aside, many women would not feel comfortable being the only person in your life. For me personally, it would feel like *way* too much responsibility. It would be a huge red flag to me if my partner had no friends to speak of. Not speaking for all women, just my two cents."

I feel like that's a terribly unfortunate thing to do. It would be better to ask, ""*How* are you checking for traps?"" and allow the player to go over poking floor tiles with a pole and holding out a stick in front of him and the like. 

Whether or not you ask that question, if you forbid checking for traps because ""the character has no reason to think there's traps"" then it's not a player character anymore, it's the DM's character, and hey could you get the group some chips while I'm playing your barbarian. Bad news. I can see the temptation if you're trying to emphasize storyline consistency, but when players play characters they're gunning for profit and survival--story just falls out of those as they go, a related consequence but not something they are seeking quite so actively. You really lose nothing by allowing this kind of nitpicky in-character/out-of-character knowledge migration, unless you just really (for instance) want your traps to work because you thought it was going to be *super cool* and want to cheat your players so you can pretend your trap beat them while they burn.

Also, consider the spotlight-hogging not as a problem, but as a symptom of something deeper. *Why* does the player want the baker thing to keep coming up? Is (s)he bored? Does (s)he wish the party would do something, *anything*, to fill the space between encounters? Does the player think the characters aren't interesting and dynamic enough, and need something to chat about? Is (s)he trying to foster group development through sharing stories and creating injokes? There's way more to this story, and putting a ""no spotlight-hogging"" sign on the door is both ignoring the real issue and alienating the player who's got a problem they're trying to address."

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390862550.0,"Beliefs and knowledge are not always a matter of conscious choice.

I know my way of dealing with friends is common. You operate under similar core principles. You likely:

- do not abuse the friendship by making the other party invest considerably more than you. You take into subconscious accounts favours they've done for you so you can pay them back.
- do not allow yourself to be taken advantage of. Consciously or subconsciously, you and others tally how much the other party invests into your friendship.
- have even had others, parents, friends, whomever let you know when they think you're being taken advantage of.
- have a mental notes, scales of how much you're far you're willing to go for different friends. How much time and money you're willing to spend to visit them. 
- know how long you've known different friends.
- and so on..

Most people engage in some combination of the above.

Most people do these calculations, perhaps not as consciously as I do, but they do. 

It's not sinister. It is as mundane as rewarding their children for obedience, or a wife granting sexual favours to her husband for gifts she received.

I'm simply consciously acknowledging it. It's not something I can ""choose"" to forget.

In practical terms, for the novice learner of some language, this translates into reading/listening to some material which he/she can follow (vaguely at first, better as the student advances into the language).

In my opinion the input-hypothesis is great because it was one of the first language-learning theories to focus on input more than output and grammar(the traditional approach). I've seen many learners predicate the same doctrine in their blogs (the input is king doctrine), and most of these learners had reached native-like fluency or something very similar to it in at least one language.

The other was a lot cheaper, the breeder wasnt that great... borderline backyard breeder, although my dog has akc papers, i dont think a lot of thought was put into which dogs she was breeding with which.

The first dog is amazing! Smart, eager to please, learns commands easily, never poops in the house. The second is smart as well, but stubborn, takes a long time to catch on to new commands, still poops in the house at least every other day (shes 1.5 years old), is scared of everything, only listens when she wants to. Cute as a button though, and I love her to pieces, she just requires more intense training.

TheArtofXan,changemyview,1390862882.0,"&gt; No job interview will ask if I've had sex.

I think it's more complicated than that, somewhat rooted in the notion of confidence you alluded to. Reddit's pretty keen on the 'confidence gets you sex' equation, but on the flip side, a lack of sex can destroy confidence, and it's not like everyone can completely compartmentalize their lives. There's certainly no shortage of people out there not having sex that desperately want to, effectively failing at the thing they value most, and that spills into everything other aspect of their lives. So if they haven't had sex in x years, a lot of people will walk into that interview carrying that baggage with them.

I know this is the internet and people can say what they want, but the spirit of this sub is to be helpful and as someone who values this community, I think it's important to be active in promoting the qualities it stands for. I have read of instances where other subs have not believed someone and the consequences were much worse than hurt feelings. That's why when I see people making accusations like these, I speak up.  This sub should be a place for people to go for advice without harassment or judgement. That's not always going to happen, but there's a better chance if the people that care say something rather than staying silent.

The fact of the matter is that one dog breed (pit bull) accounts for the *majority* of fatal dog attacks.  Combine them with rottweilers and you have over 70% of fatal attacks covered.

Source:
1) [Together, pit bulls (25) and rottweilers (1), the second most lethal dog breed, accounted for 81% of the total recorded deaths in 2013. This same combination accounted for 74% of all fatal attacks during the 9-year period of 2005 to 2013.](http://www.dogsbite.org/dog-bite-statistics-fatalities-2013.php)

Astraloid,GenderCritical,1390863255.0,"&gt; Lol, I have explained cis privilege to you all a hundred times, and you all just plug your fingers in your ears and pretend it doesn't exist. 

This isn't the least bit accurate. Disagreeing with a subject is not being blind to it. On the contrary, we have actively engaged the concept of cis privilege and demonstrated not only how it fails within the framework of patriarchy but how it actively reinforces it. We have multiple resources on this issue, both in our link cache and our sidebar. If you personally perceive a lack of response on the issue, it's more likely the result of the community here unwilling to engage you on a topic that has already been addressed. I.e. you may be a concern troll.

&gt;I realized that you all (most of you, anyway) are not being intellectually honest. Your objections to words like ""T*RF"" and ""cis"" are based on rationalizations that are, at their very best, flimsy and transparent. 

Well, I can't speak for anyone for anyone else, but personally I object to those terms because they serve to marginalize women within feminism for the express purposes of making men more comfortable. T*RF in particular, because it's quite often accompanied by threats of violence.

&gt; I think the real hatred for that word is because it separates you from the rest of feminism, and that marginalization hurts you very deeply.

The purpose of any slur is used to marginalize and denigrate the victim with the title and remind them that they are the 'other'. So, while I would describe this as marginalization by gender imperialists rather than from the rest of feminism, there is something to this.

&gt; I should note that I dislike that marginalization as well; I know a few people who are genuinely gender critical and not transphobic irl (surprise!), and they are prevented from even talking about it in feminist circles.

I'm not sure why this is a surprise to you, but ok...

&gt; This makes them feel marginalized, and they seek refuge in forums like this. It further radicalizes and alienates good people, and prevents a rather vital, imo, conversation from taking place in modern feminism.

Actually that conversation is taking place. Here, among other places. People will continue to fight for the abolition of gender norms whether or not self-proclaimed male 'feminists' feel we should.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1390863306.0,"This is an excellent strategy for any man of means and accomplishment who wants to sniff out golddiggers.

When you go out with a woman, aim to land *below* any expectations you suspect she might have. Do things like:

* Make the date cheap, and split costs wherever possible.
* Make her go to some effort to ensuring that the date even happens: things like having her pay for parking, having her transport you short distances, etc. This will tell you if she's into **you**, or simply wants someone to show her a good time and you're just the sucker filling in.
* Don't make the date better for her at your own expense. Meaning, don't fetch her things, don't inconvenience yourself, and don't let her waste your time in any way.

If she seems to whine, complain, or be disappointed about the effort she's going to, then you know you've got a self-serving gold digger on your hands. Drop her ass.

tangerinelion,cpp,1390863308.0,"For your edit, I have to say I'm not sure what the lifetime of objects is when both the LHS and RHS are temporaries like that.

But a simple block would obviously avoid the issue

    {
        Foo foo;
        std::tie(a,b) = foo;
     }

by forcing foo to exist before and after the object used by std::tie.

Though to get back to the original issue of lifetimes, it'd be trivial to create two classes with destructors that print out a statement and see what happens when you have a call like that.

My *guess* is that your above line is essentially a call to
   
    std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;&amp; std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;::operator=(const std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;&amp;)

so the LHS and RHS have to exist through the entire assignment, and it merely discards the reference returned since it is not being fed into a copy/move constructor.

(It may be a call to
 
    std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;&amp; std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;::operator=(std::tuple&lt;int&amp;,int&amp;&gt;&amp;&amp;)

though.  I'm not sure if this is correct syntax, I haven't used rvalue refs much but the fact there's a call to Foo(), a temporary, in the idea suggests that they may be invoked.)"

This was a confusing statement for me, so I had to look it up.

http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/11/2047.full.pdf+html

I'm surprised it took me this long to realize such a study is conducted.

~~Individually, each of us should have close to equal number of male and female ancestors (unless father/daughter incest was very common).~~ See edit.

As a collective, humans today have twice as many female ancestors, which shows that males historically have had much higher variance for reproductive success.

EDIT: I am an idiot. After thinking about it more, my statement didn't make mathematical sense. It didn't make that much sense to have drastically different ratios. So I did some quick thought experiments and realized I am wrong. There should still be varying individual ratios (usually not close to equal female-to-male). The degree to which the average individual ratio coincides with the collective ratio depends on various factors notably the number of generations our view is limited to and the standard deviation of the number of partners per male in that generational range."

Username_is_here,exmormon,1390863396.0,"You're right.  You can't know for sure, but actually can make reasonable estimates.  

Let's say, for simplicity, that 50% of the world's population hates Star Wars and 50% of the population loves Star Wars.  You want to know how many people hate Star Wars, so you do a survey to find out what percentage of the population hates Star Wars.

If you only interview one person, then your results will either show that 100% of people love Star Wars or 100% of people hate Star Wars.  Your results are purely determined by random chance.  

Let's say that you interview 2 people.  Either your results will show a.)100% hate Star Wars (25% chance of this happening) b.)50% hate Star Wars (50% chance of this happening) c.)0% hate Star Wars (25% chance of this happening.)

If you interview ten people there's a 65% chance that 40%-60% of people interviewed will hate Star Wars.  Basically, as your sample gets bigger, the importance of random chance decreases and the probability of getting a result that deviates from the true value gets lower and lower.

CaspianX2,patientgamers,1390863461.0,"My opinion:

Final Fantasy VI and Chrono Cross (along with Secret of Mana) are widely considered the crown jewels of the 16-bit age of the JRPG, and possibly the best JRPGs ever made. As long as you're okay with somewhat-dated sprite-based graphics, you'll find that these games have good variety in gameplay, great stories, and wonderful soundtracks.

Final Fantasy VII and VIII you've played, but my opinion is that VII was very good but overrated, and VIII was flawed but deserves more credit than it usually gets.

Final Fantasy IX is a throwback, a love letter to series fans that may not mean as much to you if you haven't played many games in the series, but is still a solid entry in the series.

Final Fantasy X discards much of the formula previous games in the series stuck with, and is largely better for it. The battle system is fun, and the story is one of the best in the series. And yeah, you might as well get the HD release when you can, and just play the other games in the meantime.

Final Fantasy X-2 is a bit of an oddity, kind-of a spin-off or side-story almost. Fun but not nearly as wonderful as its predecessor. Still, the HD re-release will include it, so it'll be worth playing through if you get that.

Final Fantasy XI is an MMO, and unless you're looking for a Final Fantasy-themed MMO i'd say don't bother.

Before I talk about Final Fantasy XII, I need to make a detour...

A long while back, another developer made a spinoff of their strategy series, Ogre Battle, called Tactics Ogre. It was a solid early entry in a budding genre that would come to be known as strategy-RPGs, tactical RPGs, or tactics-based RPGs.

The guy who directed that game, Yasumi Matsuno, did a game in a similar style for Square on the PSOne called Final Fantasy Tactics, which combined Tactics Ogre's battle system with Final Fantasy V's job system. The result was *extremely* good. The game had an *extremely* fun battle system, great music, and a spectacularly mature and complex story (albeit one marred by a bad localization). It is available for download on PS3 and I *highly* recommend it. Incidentally, if you like it and want more, you should direct your interest to the Disgaea series (also available for download on PS3).

Anyway, after that, Matsuno made a *completely* different game, set in the same world (Ivalice) called Vagrant Story. This is widely considered one of the best PSOne games ever made, and an extremely original (and hard-to-describe) RPG. Sadly, to my knowledge it is not available for download on PS3, so you'd have to buy a physical copy and use backwards-compatability to play it.

Final Fantasy XII, another game from Matsuno, takes place in the same world again, and features some of the same qualities that others loved about those earlier games - in particular, a unique battle system, and a mature complex story that focuses more on intrigue and political maneuvering than it does on monsters and magic.

Final Fantasy XIII... I haven't played, though I hear it was disappointing. Same goes for its sequel(s?).

As for other noteworthy RPGs...

As mentioned before, the Disgaea series is *tons* of fun. It takes the great battle system of Final Fantasy Tactics, adds a *ton* of variety, and a silly story that doesn't take itself too seriously.

The Shin Megami Tensei series (including the Persona series) is a darker, more offbeat and unusual game series that has a lot to offer if you're looking for something different, with themes of the occult.

Chrono Cross is a beautiful but extremely flawed semi-sequel to Chrono Trigger. Definitely play Chrono Trigger first.

Xenogears is made by the same team that made Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross (and later Xenosaga, Baten Kaitos and Xenoblade) and is kinda' (a bit) like Chrono Trigger meets Neon Genesis Evangelion."

An_entire_Grapefruit,evolution,1390863520.0,"You're right about the blue eyed gene. People from the Black Sea/Asian steppe area and lighter skin tones may have developed in Neanderthals long long ago, but I'm going to try to fit this all together. 

First off its necessary to prelude that agricultural revolutions likely occurred multiple times in history with the most recent one catapulting civilization to where it is now. Keep this in mind.

The widespread emergence of fair skin appearing much more recently than thought has been proposed by other researchers before. The most compelling theory I've heard is that fair skinned peoples emerged near the Baltic Sea coast.

Basically, people are genetically dark because of exposure to vitamin D which you will get from exposure to the sun, which is more powerful closer to the equator, and from... fish. This would explain why arctic Inuit people are darker skinned, abject to intuition. 

The Baltic Sea area is special because it is unusually warm because of a combination of weather and warm sea currents. So the people in the region were able to adopt agriculture and rely on grains in the place of game and... Wait for it... Fish! So you have agriculture arising in the Middle East where people are dark because of the sun, and in the Baltic region where it replaced fish as a food source. As we know with any agricultural societies, they give a great competitive edge. So fair skinned people were likely able to outbreed, conquer, and outlast the fishers and hunter gatherers scattered over Europe.

The blue eyes may have come from indo-European genetics and fair skin may have been a local emergence from many places similar to the Baltic Sea. The indo Europeans may have also been fair skinned. The indo Europeans were well known for the mastering of cattle and horses, but it's not out of the question, that for one reason or another, the indoeuropean people were lacking vitamin D for generations. We have to keep in mind that these people swept through much of the known world leaving their genetics all over. After all it's argued that the aryans(possible offshoots of the indoeuropeans, or for that matter the same exact people) brought fair skin to the Indian genome.

Hope this helps bring some things into context."

An Adjunct anything is generally like a contract worker: someone in the community who doesn't teach/research at the institution full time, but who has a contract to fulfil some teaching duties. For example, my dad is a clinical psychologist who worked for a nonprofit agency, but he had a side job at the local university as an adjunct instructor teaching one psych class per week.

The job duties of the Assistant/Associate/full Professors are going to be pretty much the same, but a Professor is going to outrank an Associate, and the associate the Assistant. The full Professor is probably older/more published/more experienced/better funded and might have a nicer seat at department meetings. The full Professor and Associate Professor also have tenure, which gives them more freedom and better job security. Other than that, the main difference among the ranks is pay scale.

The ""associate adjunct professor"" in your question is tough. I'm taking a stab in the dark here, but what I *think* is that Dr ABC taught at University of XYZ as an Associate Professor. Now Dr ABC has left U of XYZ and taken a job teaching one class at LMN State. Dr ABC therefore keeps her title of Associate Professor, as that is the highest title she's achieved. But since she's an adjunct at her new university, ""adjunct"" gets tacked on to it.

Please note too that academic ranks vary a lot from country to country, and what I've talked about holds for the US and, as far as I can tell, Canada. If you're looking for info about other systems, check [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_ranks)."

As soon as i realized she was dead, i could not hold back the tears, i felt a knot in my throat and started tearing up.

MaximilianKohler,AskReddit,1390863748.0,"&gt;Are you being sarcastic?

Absolutely not.

Of course it's depressing living with a disability that prevents you from living your life and doing the things you enjoy. Few people ever look at it from the disabled person's point of view. Possibly because they lack the ability to understand what it's like for them (though I don't really understand this... it seems pretty simple to imagine how horrible it would be if you were in their body).

To give you some perspective I will describe the situation of a disabled person I knew:

He was in his 20s, yet he looked like a 13 year old. He was short(ish) and quite overweight. He was unattractive. He liked a girl who was likely disgusted by him. He will probably never have sex in his whole life (much less fall in love with someone that is in love with him back) unless he hires a prostitute.

I'm not fully informed about his condition but it seemed likely that his disability is also a learning disability which would basically prevent him from doing anything substantial with his life.

Honestly, if I was him I would have killed myself long ago. He came to me for female/love advice and I had no fucking clue what to say.

My own condition is somewhat different. You wouldn't guess from seeing me that I was disabled. You would likely even assume that I am one lucky lucky guy.

However, I live as a hermit and would have killed myself years ago if I had accessible means to do so (I live in the US but it's not easy to procure a gun till you're 21). I wrote my congressional representatives in support of assisted suicide but I don't think anything came of it.

I'm not currently considering suicide for various reasons. But if I could have opted to not have been born, or to have been killed (or even provided a quick and painless method of suicide) at an early age before the immense suffering started, I would have absolutely done so.

I'm not in as difficult of a situation as previously, but at the time I remember thinking that even immortality or becoming a god was not a great enough prize for going through what I did. There was no endgame that I felt was enough to make it worth it."

I believe it is rooted in the fact that in the US, straight hair or ""tame"" curls are often seen as beautiful, while more textured hair is not, forcing black women to straighten their hair or use fake hair to be seen as beautiful (a fact that may have been true 50 years ago, but isn't necessarily true today, as natural hair is pretty accepted) .

I suspect most will say blue. It seems too ""weak"" to be my favorite, but it is my second-favorite.

RandianHero,TrueAtheism,1390863930.0,"Ah, the old ""cover your ass"" belief system, AKA the pragmatist's approach. It's a sound idea in theory, but it hinges on the assumption that God and heaven are even real to begin with. And since I have no actual reason to believe in those things, then it follows that I don't need to take a pragmatic approach in order to ""cover all my bases"".

But for the sake of argument (an agnostic approach), let's say you're right and that following a religion is a good idea just in case. Those ""easy to follow"" rules that you mentioned are all very subjective, and who's to say which rule set is the one that will actually get you into heaven? Which interpretation of God's word is actually the correct sequence necessary to get into heaven? Will I be damned if I eat meat on a Friday, or have premarital sex, or don't follow the mitzvahs? Do I need to perform Hail Marys every time I fuck up? Or do I just need to accept Christ as my lord and savior and all is forgiven? What if the monotheistic religions are all wrong, and I really needed to be following a polytheistic pantheon this whole time?

With all the religions and interpretations out there, the odds of your doctrine actually being the correct means of getting into paradise are about as slim as my lack of doctrine being the actual truth. So rather than waste my time worrying about sins or denying myself basic pleasures, I'm going to live this life like it's my only one. Because in all likelihood, it is."

So. No we need to keep pushing the boundary of ""magical ideas"" because if we never did we would be stuck in the stone age. New groundbreaking research is driven by theoretical stuff.

1) I lost a lot of weight (6'2"" @ 220 lbs -&gt; 180 lbs) and a decent number of gay guys started to hit on me (possibly because my ex would tell some of her friends about the size of my package and she was friends with a lot of gay people).

2) My ex (from above) of 5 years revealed herself to being bisexual during the last few months that we were together, which started to make me ponder the possibilities.

3) Women, as I have grown to learn, can be very difficult to become romantically engaged with compared to guys. AKA A lot of the gay guys that I know love video games, smoking bud, drinking beer, watching sports, are very extroverted, like pokemon, etc. which is all stuff that I like PLUS they tend to hit on ME, so it hypothetically sounds like a better situation to be in.

mundabit,AskWomen,1390864113.0,"Call The Midwife passed the test so well that if there were an opposite test, to see if two male characters talked about something other than a woman, every episode except one (to my memory) would fail. 

The characters feel real because they are real, the show is based off the memoires of Jennifer Worth, the inspiration for Jenny Lee.

My Grandma trained to be a midwife in the 40's and in the 50's she was head Matron, Before she passed I managed to get her to watch the first season and she loved it, She said it was a great representation of how 'a flurry of midwifes' got along in those days, She said the only issue was how much they all respected the doctor, where my grandma trained in rural Australia, midwives were trained in more OB surgical procedures than doctors were, so midwifes hated having doctors at complicated births because they were useless. So she couldn't understand that element.

On a related note, 'Miranda' is a great TV series too, Its a semi-autobiographical series about Miranda Hart (who plays Chummy in Call The Midwife) Its a sit-com so at times its very put on and fake, and while some scenes fail The Bechdel test, Its primarily a female cast and most of the jokes revolve around Miranda's clumsiness or how she gets called ""sir"" due to her height."

&gt; I understand the cost per piece would be high for what I am asking - I edited my post to try to clarify.

You should clarify again. I can't read any of your hand writing and a better drawing would help us help you. The two pieces push together, but how do they hold? Draw this out on some graph or engineering paper.

&gt; This job could be done on a manual lathe - CNC just makes way more sense for automation. I have almost NO experience with CNC Lathes, as our shop just got one, and I am not quite sure of the capabilities vs. what I am looking for. 

CNC can do everything and more that a manual lathe can do. Especially ones with rotating indexers, 5-Axis, etc. Tight tolerances and we can probe the shit out of it with Renishaw's measuring probes for extra fun. (though I wouldn't bother for something small and simple like this.) The main problem I see here is if I write the G-Code or Mazatrol program for it and crank out 15 pieces I'd have to also create one of a kind fixtures to hold these pieces as I work, and then tweaks and offsets. There's a lot of set up time involved and then it's such a small run of parts. A lot of headache for not much done. Remember, any time my machine isn't pumping out work is lost productivity time, money, and opportunity costs. It'd be different if you could match aerospace prices, for those guys I don't mind designing and building special clamp fixtures and new code for one-off parts, the money is there. I don't think the money is there in cuff links. Maybe you can find an apprentice machinist in need of a project and work with him/her."

portugalthephilosoph,democrats,1390864205.0,"Dude. The acts of individual women's and women's groups went way further in promoting rights for women than the Democratic party did. That was the original point. But, since we're on the topic, here's MY list: legislation promoted by Democrats to hamper women's rights, or legislation defeated by Democrats for the same purpose:

*Republicans pushed the 19th Amendment (women's suffrage) in Congress every year in the 1870's and 1880's, but the Democrats were able to keep it bottled up in various committees for another decade before allowing either chamber to vote on it. In 1887 it finally reached the floor of the Senate. Once again, however, it was defeated by a vote of 34 to 16. After this setback, advocates of women's suffrage opted to put pressure on Congress by convincing various state legislatures to pass bills giving women the vote. This was met with some success. By the turn of the century a variety of Republican-controlled states, including Wyoming, Colorado, and Idaho, had granted women suffrage.
*When the Amendment was submitted to the states, 26 of the 36 states that ratified it had Republican legislatures. Of the nine states that voted against ratification, eight were Democratic. Many of these Democrat-controlled states refused to ratify the amendment until the 1970s.
*In the 2010 midterm elections, the gender gap disappeared for the first time since the Reagan era. More Republican women were elected to the House than ever before, and four out of six current female governors are Republicans.
*The Lily Ledbetter Act did NOT mandate equal pay for equal work. Check the legislation. Equal pay has been mandated ever since the Equal Pay Act was signed into law in 1963--after being authored and introduced by a Republican. Lily Ledbetter simply shifted the burden of proof from Trial Attorneys (large majority of which are male), to the business itself (30% of which are owned by women). Bad example.

REAL change came through individual women fighting for a cause. Not a politician using them as a pawn--which is happening now. I'm disappointed in anyone who can buy into this."

Wards wards and more wards will help you do so. In addition someone on your team should hopefully be getting an XP advantage from being in a solo lane. If your mid dcs and you send your support to cover mid your ADC should gain a level advantage Bot. He may be below in CS but if your jungler comes to gank a 1-2 level lead is very strong early/mid game and you can often catch them off guard. Of course a lot of this is assuming the game is still close. If your teemo feeds 10 kills to riven and then happens to disconnect its gonna be tough to try and fight back.

&gt; she has no issues with me even checking out other women because she understands it's part of being a male that you want to have sex with just about every attractive women you see

I would view this as massive disrespect. I don't think traits are gender oriented, so saying that it's a ""male thing"" is irrelevant and actually a bit insulting to the men who don't behave like this. My SO used to do this until I pointed out how immature and disrespectful it was, and he completely agreed. He holds no resentment over not being able to eye-fuck whatever he wants. It's very easy not to. (I don't check out other men all the time, it's very easy.) I said something referring to the fact that when we're on a date he should be focused on me and not the other women in the room he would be interested in fucking. Disrespectful, no? 

Allow me to point out that he views our relationship more highly than the freedom to check out other women. 

&gt;  setting limits like this is going to make him feel bad about you in general and most likely after he's had a few and his friends tease him enough he'll probably say ""fuck her, I'm doing it""

Nonono. Setting boundaries is perfectly acceptable. If he chooses to agree with them and then decides to leave her over that, that is not her fault and *absolutely should not be expected.* Besides, that places strip clubs as so important to him he would leave his SO over it? What? (Also, I would expect better friends of my SO, not ones that would tease him over being respectful to his girlfriend by not attending a strip club.) And if he's the type to say ""fuck her, I'm doing it"" she shouldn't be dating him anyway. Complete lack of respect for his girlfriend coupled with deceit. (If he agree to the boundaries she set, going anyways and not telling her would be lying. And just a plain scummy thing to do.)"

Nerf_Circus,Fitness,1390864472.0,"I have had 3 fitness related injures.

The first physical activity I did in like 5 years. I ran/walked/limped a 21km tough mudder. With my inactive lifestyle my hipflexors had naturally shortened, after 4km's every step felt like being stabbed. I did another 17km and then a 2km walk back to the car. I wasn't going slow either, to try and keep up with my friends I was overtaking people left and right. The next morning I couldn't get out of bed for over an hour due to cramps. This was Oct 2011. In Feb 2012 I started SS at my local gym. In a month, I fucked up my knees for most of the year.

When I started squatting i created a muscle imbalance in my knee area. Due to poor form. My knees would cave in on the way up. To solve this I didn't squat for 6months, letting the muscles weaken naturally. Then I hired a trainer, to get my form right. The pain has only truly disappeared in the past few weeks with me squatting again. I guess squatting with good form is building up those weak muscles. I squat barefoot when ever I can (ie. the gym staff aren't around.) Squatting in shoes fucks with my balance as it feels like I'm standing on a Bosu ball. I have considered getting weight lifting shoes but no where stocks them and I'm unsure about buying shoes online due to size issues."

What I see from most feminists now is an integration of the ideology and values and a ton more intersectionality. There are times when I am a bit ashamed of donning the label largely due to much of the ""you're doing feminism WRONG"" shite I see on the internet, but can reconcile that with the knowledge that most of us IRL are working toward inclusivity and equality.

I'm on the pill and I gained weight when I was overeating every day and I lost weight when I was on a calorie deficit.

As for the pill itself, I hate it because it becomes really annoying having to have it at the same time each day, everyday. Because I've had cousins staying over in the last week I misplaced mine the night before last so I missed yesterday's one and might miss today's one unless my cousins go. Thankfully I'm not with anyone or having sex at the moment so I'm okay with missing it. I'd say go for something else instead of the pills unless you think it'll be entirely okay for you. I'd go for another contraceptive but I've yet to come across another that would make my periods lighter like the pill does."

I read Lloyd Alexander's Prydain books (and his great Westmark trilogy, which was like Les Mis for teens), I read Narnia, I read Redwall, and pretty much any other fiction I could get.

In seventh grade though, a friend lent me The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and that was when I got hooked.  I went on to read LotR six more times, and the Silmarillion twice in high school, and began to seek out fantasy novels specifically.  Just before ninth grade I picked up The Eye of the World, and ate up the rest of the series  - which was limited then to seven books.  I read through the three books of ASOIAF, Eddings, a bit of Salvatore, and a few other novels.

It wasn't until college that I began to branch out, about the time I got much more involved in a WoT fansite called wotmania.  It was my first internet community and I loved it.  I picked up recommendations like Gaiman, Erikson, Bakker, and after seeing Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on DVD, read that series for the first time.

They were not running a hot spare and by the time the first failed drive got replaced, the second one had already lost data.

Iamyourbetter,DebateReligion,1390864960.0,"That's a tough question to answer. The story needs some more context. The Lord had commanded Nephi to get he plates. Twice before Nephi killed Laban, he attempted to negotiate with Laban for the plates. Understand that Nephi's family had a right to posses the plates. After asking Laban for the plates and being rejected, Nephi and his brothers returned with all of his family's precious and priceless metals and belongings in an attempt to buy the plates from Laban even though Laban had no right to keep them in his control. But what happened was Laban stole Nephi's stuff and the had his guards attempt to kill all of them.

Basically Laban was in the wrong here legally, and you could probably attempt to argue that Nephi had a right to kill Laban to get his brass plates from a secular stand point; maybe even a moral stand point.
 
The killing of Laban is the spiritual law's version of the necessity clause I suppose is one way you could interpret it."

Personally, I'm disappointed. I'd rather see more, not less, and certainly not nothing of Hale. And if Kenzi had the Twig of Zamorra, why the heck would she sell such a powerful gift from Hale for anything lesser and temporary? That. makes. no. sense. 

Also, technically speaking, was Massimo just too tired to harm Kenzi after he took a beating from Hale? Because that's what he came there for, and he simply left after killing Hale, content with leering at Kenz about it? I mean, come on, he's evil, and she had no more protection. 

Finally, why couldn't they summon the gang to help Bo save Hale? They all have cell phones, weren't doing particularly important things, and have been adept at assembling on short notice in the past .... 

Speaking of the past, I've still been wrangling with why, exactly, Hale failed as Ash. I feel like Hale's gotten the short end of the stick in this show. Pun intended. 

Well, Kenzi's going to have some dramatic scenes next episode for sure, and some expressions of regret, I'd wager. And I hope Massimo gets what's coming to him, and the Twig of Zamorra is returned to Kenzi, if it cannot be used to help Hale.

I wish I had some real advice for you besides ""don't think about it,"" but that's what I have to do for myself. Really loving someone is hard when they can't/won't reciprocate, but you kind of have to move on. You can't force someone to change their mind and wasting your time wishing it could be different is really self-destructive. Focus on yourself and your hobbies and the good feelings will return.

That said, I don't think his ceiling is all that high, and I'd rather try and draft a fresh RB out of college who could end up being a premier starter.  

EDIT: Might as well include this thought, too. My biggest fear is that we cut CJ and then end up overpaying for Moreno or Blount, expecting them to all of a sudden be full-time starters coming off of breakout seasons (in Blount's case, just a breakout half-season). This would effectively put us right back in the same boat.

MrShiftyCloak,summonerschool,1390865238.0,Thanks I'm on mobile so that helps. Your right enforcing basics and mechanics is a good place to start. In addition I would recommend focusing on a smaller champion pool of say 4-5 champions covering at least 2 roles. Getting comfortable ina role and with certain champions can make it easier to focus on the basics rather than worrying about relearning a champion ontop of it.

Each year the psychology department at my uni reaches out to their students to ask for volunteers for the food servicing. It provides exposure for the students to these facilities and allows them to be in direct contact with patients.

Approaching a hospital or university may help. I believe there would be opportunity to delve deeper once you have your foot on the door."

Oh but you want the answer you THINK is right.  Well okay then.  This was actually a tough one actually so good for you!  Here are the top most selected players and how many pro bowl wins they participated in:

Tony Gonzalez: 9 (Tricky because he changed from AFC to NFC, but if he hadn't skipped a year he'd have gotten 10 either way!)

Critics have read the book as both an ""exemplary postmodern text""[2] and an outright parody of postmodernism.[3] ""Mike Fallopian cannot be a real character's name,"" protests one reviewer.[4] Pynchon himself disparaged this book, writing in 1984, ""As is clear from the up-and-down shape of my learning curve, however, it was too much to expect that I'd keep on for long in this positive or professional direction. The next story I wrote was The Crying of Lot 49, which was marketed as a 'novel,' and in which I seem to have forgotten most of what I thought I'd learned up until then.""[5]"

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390865591.0,"The way to do a low cash out of pocket hard money deal is as follows.

Hard money lender will lend 70% ARV. (varies from lender to lender, 65 or 70 are common)

Find a house with ~$100k ARV.

You can finance up to $70k on a $100k ARV, so if you can get purchase price+repairs+closing costs under $70k, you will have low out of pocket (just holding costs).  More realistic scenario, you buy the place for $50k with $15k in repairs.  You finance $70k (which covers your most of your closing costs), and end up spending at total of $5k in cash to close + holding costs.  You can finance closing costs for backend refi to conventional, so will end up with a final mortgage of ~$73k.

Note that that would be a really great deal.  The more you pay, the higher your out of pocket, e.g., same house:

$65k purchase, $15k repairs, $5k additional costs

Max hard money: $70k

Total out of pocket $15k

You could still do a ton of deals that way, more if you use a private money lender who will allow immediate cash-out refi and higher LTV.

Hope that helps."

Anyway, i don't think Durant being younger would be so much of a factor. We're not talking 10 year contracts, and he's just got a couple of years on Lebron. Also, i don't think the criteria you chose for your ranking is good at all. You can't just base the way you rank in a season, you have to take into account the past, at least the close past(meaning the NBA playoffs 2012-2013). The question is who's the better SF, not who's being the better SF this season. I don't know why you're having difficulty getting over this simple problem.

Narhem,cars,1390865751.0,"1. dohc have way less reciprocating mass (which is one of the reasons why they rev faster)

2. can have 4 valves per cylinder, breath better[makes more power] 

3. has independent intake/exhaust valves (again better breathing and revs faster)

4. LS series engines have 2 valves per cylinder vs 4 (I think there was a prototype with 3 valves for the LS7 but either way the intake exhaust would not be independent), this is obviously a big choking point as far as efficiency. 

5. Pushrods have a lower center of mass and smaller overall package (which is good for engine swaps), but the UZ engine is relatively small so its pretty good too. 

6. Also since LS is a pushrod I think there is only 1 camshaft which makes getting a hotter cam cheaper (1 vs 4 in the UZ)(keeping in mind you also have to buy the actual pushrods depending on the severity of the cam). 

7. A pushrod engine cannot have center exhaust would is desirable for quick spooling turbos(most turbo v8 audis and BMWs) and keeping heat away from sensitive electronics(see porsche 918)

There are alot of trades off for each engine design, but in the end of the day I will always prefer the new, more efficient DOHC engine.

A point of DOHC being more efficient was GM having trouble upping the power output of the LT4 for the new Z06, they wanted to keep in NA but ran into emission issues when the tried to increase power so they SC'd it. 

Also the OHC vs push rod is only an issue in V series motors (although I don't think anyone makes a v6 pushrod engine or really anyone other than GM uses OHC). Almost all modern I and H engines are some form of OHC. 

The ultimate in head design would be the free valve tech that koenigsegg is testing out , as seen in this:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bch5B23_pu0. Although the COM might not be as low as a pushrod the engine weight would way lower, it be way smaller and it would breath way better.

Keep in mind there are also 32v head kits for LS series engines if you really want a more modern head design(although they are expensive and really only worth it if you must stay in some NA only racing class that allows aftermarket heads, since FI would provide better HP per $). There are plenty of LS guys running 1000+hp with pushrod heads. 

edit: readability also free to correct me if I'm wrong anywhere."

Why are we still friends? Our world-views are the same and evolved in similar methods. It's the random chance of personal development that kept us from growing away from each other. Most of our political views have aligned over the years.

ctesibius,motorcycles,1390866049.0,"I can't really understand it myself, and there's a lot of argument over whether this will work or is physically impossible. However, to have a very brief shot at your questions:

The ""quantum regime"" is working on the scale of atoms. Things work differently at that scale - different laws of physics come in to play. So for instance if you have a bike locked in a garage, there is zero chance that it will suddenly appear on the other side of the door. But for very small stuff like electrons, they can ""tunnel"" through barriers at a low and random rate.

What they are trying to do is more interesting though. There is a limit on how efficient a ""heat engine"" can be. A bike engine is a heat engine - so is a nuclear power plant. You can't change all the heat energy from the petrol or uranium in to useful power: most of it is lost as waste heat. This is not a design deficiency, but a result of the physics. You can work out the maximum possible efficiency from Carnot's equation: 

Max efficiency = 1 - Tc/Th

where Tc is the temperature of the cold part of the engine (the temperature of expanded exhaust gas in the bike engine, the temperature of tepid water leaving the cooling towers in the nuclear power plant) and Th is the temperature to which it's heated (by burning petrol / air mix or reacting uranium). The bigger the difference between the two, the more efficient the engine can be. This is why water cooling systems on bikes try to keep the engine as hot as possible without damaging it - you get more power out. It's also how turbochargers make engines more efficient: they allow the exhaust gas to expand, cooling it, and recover the heat energy from the gas (which they then use to compress the incoming gas, but that's a separate issue).

Anyway, that Carnot efficiency is always taken to be the absolute limit on how much power we can get out, and even the best heat engines waste half the energy of their fuel by chucking it out as waste heat. These guys reckon that by using the different physics down at the atomic level, they can ""cheat"" and get more energy out. Other people say that it amounts to a perpetual motion machine. I don't know myself."

I know exactly what you mean about the Greenland thing, but I kind of enjoyed that to be honest. As soon as he had another daydream in Greenland with Wig I knew it was real and I could move on. But putting it out there to mess with you just a little bit was fun to me.

For what I really loved about the daydreams were how much the camera work changed. I was hooked within a minute of the film opening. The steady highly composed shots were awesome. And I particularly loved how the camera work drastically changed from static to kinetic during a daydream. And I also appreciated how camera movement crept into his real life as his life became more adventurous - an obvious, but nice touch in my opinion."

You'd do this. With a QTN lathe it wouldn't be bad.

It'd be silly to machine them on a lathe all connected and physically cut them apart by hand and then finish sanding and polishing then, so much easier to just have the tool go through.

Edit: To clarify, for anyone who's not familiar, SQL injection attacks work by appending additional commands to the original query, so if the original query is *SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '$name'*, the user might pass *blah'; DROP TABLE users* as his name, so the final query selects any row where name is equal to ""blah"" and also drops the table, which is obviously undesirable for the admin.

They write it off but build in that loss to their pricing scheme.  If 10% of people never paid their bill last year then the hospital assumes 10% of bills go unpaid and adjust it so that 90% of the billed amount this year will be enough money to not lose money.  The GOP and especially tea party then look at these 10% and say we should deny them services since they cause everyone else's bills to be higher.)"

ck_mooman,CampingandHiking,1390866457.0,"Live near Yosemite. 
1.) I believe the majority of the trails are open although if it involves anything near Glacier Point I'm not sure because although it has been dry you never know that high up. Look for trails north of the valley. Should be good this time of year and unlike Tioga road, Big Oak Flat road is open with relatively secure/close parking lots to the trailheads.

2.) If you park on any of the parking lots on the Big Oak Flat Road I believe you don't need an overnight parking permit but don't hold me to that, look it up. The road is littered with trailheads and at each one is a decent size lot, about 6-8 cars. 

3.) Go by the wilderness office located next door to the Ansel Adams gallery. I think they open at 8 am. During the summer there is a line and there might still be one so try to enter the park around 6:30 or earlier and you should be fine. Plus at that hour nobody mans the entrance. Plus seeing the valley at Viewpoint right as you exit the tunnel is spectacular in the wee hours of the morning.

4.) The trail I recommend is the North Rim Trail which covers the north rim of the valley (duh I know). It is mainly uphill because you're constantly ascending or constantly descending. It's wilderness but gives you a great view if you summit El Cap. I highly recommend you do not attempt it unless you are very fit otherwise you will be hard-pressed to enjoy it while you are dying for air. Another thing is water is a bit far apart up there. I last was up there in July and there were 2-3 small creeks, a decent small river, and then Yosemite Falls. So bring BIG water bottles; I love the Nalgene 32 oz. plastic ones. I carry two as standard. The downside to this trail is if you get caught in weather it can be dangerous. Mud is a guarantee. Slippery granite as well. These can be dangerous because about 0.005% of this trail is level ground. The good news is if you get caught in nasty weather and want to get out quick you have two options.
     a.) you can hike down the Yosemite Falls trail which is harder than it sounds. Definitely 2-3 hours and in the rain will be sketchy in many parts. But it drops you off right by Camp 4 in the middle of the valley.

     b.) there is a trail that snakes off north from the north rim trail. It has its own separate designation and I recommend looking it up as well as a possibility. Anyway it is mainly level ground and is maybe 6-12 miles almost straight north to the Big Oak Flat road that loops around. It may be a different road I can't remember but look into it.

Stay dry and stay safe. The Yosemite Wilderness is a beautiful place and I treasure having it so close but it can kill you faster than you can comprehend. If you have time and $28 I suggest you stop by the Ahwahnee Hotel and get a copy of a book in their gift shop called ""Death in Yosemite"". Interesting read that will teach you loads about the park that you probably didn't know. Also get a cappuccino in the cafe and enjoy your accomplishment even if you don't finish your trail/see what you wanted/etc. 

Hope this helps :)"

piratelibrarian,sex,1390866492.0,"Firstly, I just want to say that latex is hurred when you have any kind of curves. It's hard to put on, it's hard to wear, it's hard to take off and when you do it's kinda smelly. It *is* fun, though. Given the way you've described yourself, starting with a pencil skirt would probably be nice. You can pair it with oodles of sexy stuff (fishnet, sequins, whatevs) and it's a relatively easy garment to get used to. It *will* squish the fatty bits in and out and such. This is the nature of the material.

Secondly, I'm wondering if there are any sex shows in your area? In mine, we have the Everything About Sex Show and there are always purveyors of kinky gear there. It would give you an opportunity to try latex stuff on and get a feel for it. Keep your eyes open. 

Thirdly, stretch PVC is often a better choice. It's not quite as confining (that may be what you're going for, though and power to you), sews up like a dream, and isn't really any less maintenance."

The first two days were WONDERFUL. My current pimples were shrinking, my pores were tight, and my face was sooo soft. On day 3 I started getting this weird rashy/breakout, but everyone on Reddit said that it was NORMAL and it was just PURGING so I needed to continue. From that point on it just got worse and worse so I stopped. I acquired the worst eczema and painful/crusty cystic acne. I NEVER had this before.

mkvgtired,AskReddit,1390866781.0,"&gt; I was overseas

Where was this, and where are you from? 

I was in Eastern Turkey last winter. It was in a part of the country where the US embassy says they will not send employees if citizens get in trouble. I was supposed to be taking a taxi all the way back to Diyarbakir (I know this is what I paid for because a Kurdish friend ordered it for me in their native language). The taxi dropped me off at a bus depot on the [Syrian border](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/Cizre,+Turkey/@37.3074216,42.1557547,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x40096401b82f5eaf:0xb0bde53725aeb8d8) and played the ""no English"" game when I tried to explain I paid for a taxi for the entire trip back. 

The taxi driver paid for my bus ticket and left. Bus depot might be too strong of a word. It was pretty dead. I was the only person there. A couple young teens walked in and brazenly tried to take my wallet out of my pocket while saying ""money, money."" I said no, and pushed my wallet back into my pocket. 

They left, and came back with several more teens. The biggest one pulled out a knife and said ""money"". He was holding the knife far out in front of him so his wrist would have been easy to grab. There was also a sharp rock propping the door open. It would have been a perfect weapon, but I would have had to act fast to get to it. When I stood up, I started walking towards them and I think it confused them a little. 

They backed off a little but they were still there. The biggest kid kept lunging toward me and swiping his knife at my neck level. He kept his distance far enough that I was not under immediate threat from the knife, but it was close enough to make you uncomfortable (4 feet, 1.3m). The one bus stop employee must have heard something and came out of a room and started yelling. I think he must have known who they were and they eventually left. 

The closest US consulate is in Erbil, Iraq. With the insanely bureaucratic border crossing, its about 6 hours away. The closest consulate in Turkey was about 8 hours away. While this was happening I was thinking my best ""escape"" route would be fleeing back into the safety of Iraq, which would sound counter intuitive to most people. I was not planning on waiting around for police either if anything happened. I would have got the hell out of there to the closest consulate.

I finally came clean to my mom the day before I was in Northern Iraq for the past week and a half (I would never tell my dad before/when I was there, he would have a heart attack). This was prompted by accidentally going through Kirkuk, a dangerous city even by Iraqi standards. Other than than that I felt completely safe the vast majority of the time. When I called her she said she trusted my judgement but said ""I have to admit, I'm glad you're going back to Turkey tomorrow."" Two hours in, and some asshole is swiping a knife at my throat. I thought about how absurdly random this world is and how people's perceptions can be completely off. I just started laughing my ass off. I still have never told my parents this story though, and I doubt I ever will. 

All said and done, I had been traveling between destinations for the better part of that day (well over 12 hours). I got to Diyarbakir about 11 pm (iirc). When I got back to Diyarbakir, I splurged in the one nice hotel that entire trip. I got a bottle of Jack, flipped on CNN International, and got trashed alone. "

One of the consultants came over to ask if I need anything, so I asked about that dinosaur. Apparently, they bought it when it was brand new, but it was way too expensive for normal people to buy and pro photographers don't really buy their gear from generic electronics stores in a mall.

Ralkir,changemyview,1390866895.0,"&gt;Is there a difference between accusing someone of being untrustworthy and demanding someone demonstrate trustworthiness? In both cases the assumption is that she is not.

No that's not the assumption, that's your assumption. Others assumption is that they are trustworthy and even THAT trustworthy, but they just want an independent assessment, one that is not blinded by emotions, and more accurate than a person evaluating another person ever will be. 

&gt;Why is the demonstration of trustworthiness waiting until after **dating, after sex, and potentially even after marriage?**

Look at those. Every single one of those is a point of a relationship that steps had to be made, steps where levels of trust had to be increased, that partners had to demonstrate to one another that they were worthy of the next step. You don't go from dating to, whelp I trust you now lets get married. Like you seem to suggest.

&gt;People should DEMONSTRATE trustworthiness at the beginning of the relationships, when I am hired, when we first agree to work together, when I reach the first leadership position, or when we **first started dating.**

Trust is something that is continually built upon and more importantly **continually evaluated**. And when the relationship changes, the levels of trust must change, and people must demonstrate that to each other. 

Let me pose a hypothetical to you. Let's take a man, he marries a woman, they're together for like 3 years of marriage. No problems at all, no signs of cheating or anything whatsoever (this happens), then they have a baby and it turns out the baby is not the same ethnicity of the married couple. This is the only sign that cheating has occurred in the relationship. So the man gets a paternity test and sure enough it's not his child, so he divorces and moves on with his life.

Years later he has remarried, and just like his previous wife, no problems, their both head over heels in love with each other and she is pregnant. Would you fault this man for wanting a paternity test?

ballepung,AskMen,1390866933.0,"I nice rule of thumb: we guys are either serious, or we're not. There really isn't any middle-ground. We're pretty black and white there.

Sure, there are guys who start out the relationship by not being so serious and then suddenly become serious. But usually, we know deep inside already after a few weeks(maybe even just a few days) that the girl we're currently dating, isn't the person we're gonna settle down with. We'll usually try to rationalize the relationship by saying: *""hey, we might end up falling in love you know!""* But we know that the chances are nearly microscopical. Being in a relationship can be comfortable. Especially if you're with a girl who adores you(because she's hooked on you).

Truth be told: when you never really loved the person to begin with, nor made any clear plans for the future or any serious commitment, then breaking up becomes a fairly easy process, even for a sensitive guy.

Of course, we can't ignore the possibility that he might just be an asshole. They exist."

My problem is that I don't really know a better way things could have been handled. I personally think being offended by the .gif in question is reaching a little, but just because I wasn't personally offended doesn't mean it's offensive. I think that this mass-apology-email trivializes the subject because a large portion of the audience doesn't take it seriously, and so when something similar comes up again that does resonate with more people (read, is potentially more offensive than this, if you can really even quantify offensiveness..) people will brush it off.

but hey whatever. I imagine until March this is all we have to do remake ""Spoiler let's talk about the ending"" threads.

In the [most recent](http://www.reddit.com/r/divergent/comments/1v3vyb/just_finished_the_series_and_im_disappointed/cep1g3s) one I gave my thoughts. 

----

Basically I didn't believe it. I assumed it was a red herring and she would come back. I was reading it digitally so it's not like I could even go ""oh there's only five pages left so obviously this is real now"" I'm not sure I thought it was real until Four sprinkled her ashes.

So I of course didn't feel anything the entire time. (I didn't feel much when I realized it either). I don't like Tris. Basically she's a brat. She's not a strong intelligent character. She's a whiny brat who is never wrong. She's like Sheldon from The Big Bang Theory.

My attraction to this series is in the world building. I've said it before and I'll say it again. It completely destroyed Hunger Games in that respect. Because Hunger Games expects me to believe that for SEVENTY FIVE YEARS they have an annual ""REAPING""\* where parents just let their children be taken. That's insane. Fractured society I get. But lack of parental attachment is a tougher nugget to swallow. [Asimov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30016.The_Naked_Sun) did it, [Butler](http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/29535.Octavia_E_Butler) did it. Collins did not. Here in Divergent we have a social order that is segmented but it's not involuntary segmentation. It's completely voluntary and that makes the difference. That agency is what makes me believe this society could be standing for likely more than 120 years (six generations right?)

This entire book felt like it was railroaded in imo. I didn't like the completely new direction. I think I'm capable of accepting a ""new reality"" but for whtever reason this one just wasn't sitting with me. The death of Tris was rather out of nowhere. I'm not saying I need my heroes to die in a hail of bullets but it felt empty. It's part of why I didn't think it was real.

It seems like all the YAs have some sort of problem. *The Hunger Games* had bad worlds. *Divergent* has bad characters. *Uglies* has repetition. Oh lord did that have repetition. If you ever started it.. make SURE you read book 4 because he broke the cycle and it's WONDERFUL. *The Mortal Instruments* (only 3 books in) has terrible romance issues like: *Twilight* which was just ... it was so bad it was almost disgusting at points to read.

\* - I mean seriously? A rEAPING? Could she have thought of a more offensive word? At least [Shirley Jackson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lottery) called it a ""Lottery"". Because a bloody Lottery makes sense. It sounds nice without lying about what it is."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390867085.0,"Look neat. If you are overweight, you have to make a special effort to avoid coming off as sloppy. Getting a good haircut and having neatly trimmed facial hair can give a bigger guy an extra oomph. Without knowing what you look like, I can't specify what look you should go for, but do some research and ask around. Another thing about looking neat-- wear clothes that hide sweat. 

I second the comment about wearing clothing with structure. Jackets are a great way to do this. Wear tailored clothing. Spend a little extra money to get stuff that fits your proportions well. (Every man should do this, but it is especially important if you are big. You don't want a jacket that goes down to your knees or saggy pants that bunch up at the ankle.)

A navy sport coat with a solid colored shirt, belt, jeans, and dress shoes can be flattering. 

Don't be shy about dressing a bit like a lumberjack (jeans and a plaid button-down shirt with sleeves rolled up, with work boots like Timberland or such). Being bigger can give you a masculine edge if you play it the right way. 

Be genuine, nice, and funny. The PUA stuff is for guys who don't ""have time"" for women to get to know them (because the longer the women spend with them the more bored or disturbed they get by their personalities). For many women, attraction grows by getting to know a person, so you have a good shot if you just are friendly, relaxed, and--this is the key--have fun. If you have fun, they have fun. If they have fun around you, they start to desire you. 

Get a good education and a good job. Take good care of yourself. A fat guy who loves life and makes good choices is attractive. A fat guy whose body reflects depression, lack of motivation, etc. is not attractive.

Tall_LA_Bull,AskMen,1390867138.0,"If you're not exclusive, then seeing another guy she dates while you're out together is just an unfortunate coincidence. That shouldn't have been an issue for you, and maybe it wouldn't have been.

How she handled it--hiding in the bathroom and then sending you a garbled text hinting that you should leave--is unacceptable and rude. It shows that she is not, in fact, mature enough to handle dating multiple people at once. Or, worse, that she was not being honest with at least one of you about the nature of the relationship.

What should you do about that? Who knows. Don't take that kind of advice from strangers on the internet who have only a passing familiarity with the situation. You have to decide for yourself."
clairebones,relationships,1390867148.0,"When you say you 'asked' her about it, how exactly did you ask her? **Edit-** I saw in another comment that you didn't actually ask her anything, just made an insulting childish accusation in the middle of the bar in front of your friends. I mean if I was married to someone and we had kids, I'd be seriously fucking offended if they were questioning my behaviour after one conversation with a stranger. If they made a comment like you made I probably wouldn't talk to them for at least a day. Do you know how hard it is to get someone to stop talking to you at a bar, drunk or not? Talking to a person and taking a photo at their request isn't even 'potentially' flirtatious, it's just being a polite stranger at a bar.

I think you need to calmly explain to your wife that you realise you overreacted, and apologise (not ""I'm sorry you got hurt by what I sad"" but ""I'm sorry for accusing you of that"")."

When I was in hospital a social worker started the paperwork for me to apply for Newstart Allowance as an 'incapacitated"" person.
Instead of reporting my looking for work activities, I provide a medical certificate that says I was unable to work.

They may try to get you to meet with their own assessor, but that isn't to remove your benefits, it is to assess if Disability is a better option long term for you.

My GP does my med certs. I've been on the system since August.
I am going back to uni in late Feb with a 3/4 load that still counts as fulltime so that I can claim Youth Allowance.

I had to move home to my mum's house and will need to stay there while I'm at uni. I've lived with housemates but it didn't end well. It's a very affordable option and can be good for social aspects.

On Newstart I receieve about $530.00 per fortnight. Before, when I was on Youth Allowance ion the past, it was closer to $470.00 with rent assistance. However, you can work more hours before being penalised.

Ein interessanter Abschnitt für mich:

&gt; On 31 October 2006, Mr Banner had a call with Christian Schmiderer (who he describes 
as being from the Investment Banking division of JPMorgan).
&gt;
 There were various 
topics covered during the conversation, including the need to ensure that the client 
understood the trade,
 with Mr Banner confirming his own understanding that the 
transaction *“of course entails risks, great risks for the client.”*


&gt; They also discussed the 
internal approval process at BVG, with Mr Schmiderer wary of approaching Dr Sarrazin 
(who he knew) directly,242
 but making it clear that the submission to the Supervisory 
Board was key: *“...the submission to the supervisory board must be worded in a way that 
nothing can go wrong.”*

Mr Schmiderer said of Dr Sarrazin: *“He‟s a nit-picker and, well, I‟d say that if he deals with this, he might become suspicious because he‟ll say that an investment bank will possibly make a lot of money out of it”.*

Ich denke es waren auch einige andere Kräfte am Werk, aber das soll Sarrazin Verantwortungslosigkeit nicht entschuldigen. 

Das absolut krasseste ist ja, das anscheinend nur ein Gewinn von knapp 8 Millionen US Dollar möglich war, bei diesem Finanzgeschäft:

&gt; As already set out above, the upfront premium payable under the JPM Swap by 
JPMorgan Chase to BVG was US$7,856,537.

Bei solchen mageren Profiten solch ein massives Risiko mit Steuergeldern einzugehen, find ich ganz schön heftig. Wenn man über die Gerichtsakte drüber fliegt, kommt's einem echt so vor, als hätte ein Multi-Level-Marketing Mafioso ein paar frischen 18-jährigen Genussscheine an einem rostigen Öltanker verkauft. Wie so etwas durchgewinkt wird bei solch hohen Summen (mit unserem Geld btw), ohne das mehrere Profis den Vertrag gründlichst studieren, ist für mich unverständlich. 

**Edit**: Anscheinend wurden ""Profis"" angeheuert, die den Vertrag gründlichst studieren sollten, nämlich die internationale Großkanzlei Clifford Chance. 

&gt; Weil dem zuständigen Mitarbeiter der Verkehrsbetriebe bewusst war, dass er von dem Finanzdeal zu wenig verstehen, hat er die Kanzlei Clifford Chance mit einer rechtlichen Beurteilung des Geschäftes beauftragt. Die BVG bezahlte dafür 45.000 Euro an die Kanzlei. In Wirklichkeit arbeitete die Kanzlei allerdings im Auftrag der Investmentbank JPMorgan.

&gt;Umstritten ist, wie deutlich die Kanzlei den Verkehrsbetrieben BVG gesagt hat, dass sie in Wirklichkeit für die Investmentbank arbeitet. In einer Stellungnahme der Kanzlei Clifford Chance für die taz heißt es: „Die BVG war nie unser Mandant. Wir gaben auf Bitten unserer langjährigen Mandantin JPMorgan eine Legal Opinion für einen Dritten ab. Die BVG wusste dies und war damit einverstanden.“

&gt; Am 9. Mai gibt es den ersten Kontakt zwischen Verkehrsbetrieben und der Kanzlei. Der Finanzexperte der Verkehrsbetriebe erläutert einem Anwalt und Miteientümer von Clifford Chance das Geschäft, so wie er es verstanden hat. Der Anwalt verschweigt, dass er im Auftrag der Investmentbank arbeitet.

Ralkir,changemyview,1390867288.0,"&gt;If you did win against a pro with a ""cheese"" strategy, then they deserved to lose for not defending themselves from an obvious and simple strategy.

Wrong, there are several maps where if the pro scouts me last they will lose, because they don't have enough time to react to it. 

&gt;At any rate, when you play a competitive game, you do not play to ""measure the skills people want to see measured"". You play to win. The strategy used by a player is irrelevant, because the victory goes to the player who achieved the victory condition.

&gt;Because of this, calling a strategy ""lame"" or ""cheap"" is purely being a sore loser (or a sore spectator). A competitor is not there to be interesting. **He is not there to entertain.**

You are completely wrong on this one my friend. The competitors ARE there to entertain. The whole reason high level of any competition exists is because PEOPLE are willing to pay to support it and pay to watch it. That is the only reason. If you don't have a fan base you don't have a competition. So at the end of the day, it is about entertainment, because without the fans, you don't have a product.

This is all junk because hours played don't translate to revenue. They don't translate to fun, either. Most new Final Fantasy games are like 80 hours long.

&gt;The multiplayer in Half Life 2 was pretty bad compared to the first one and I doubt that it will be any better in Half Life 3.

*Nobody* cares about Half-Life 2's multiplayer. It was never the focus, ever. Most people don't even realize Half-Life 2 had multiplayer.

&gt; It makes no sense to stick to those games.

How about finishing up the *extremely huge, extremely abrupt* cliff-hanger they ended the last game on? Have you even played through the Half-Life series? Both HL1 and HL2 have *some* sort of end, but HL2:E2 ends abruptly and on the biggest cliffhanger of the series- *probably* because we were promised a third game, since it was supposed to be an episodic trilogy. I don't know if people just circlejerk or what, but the way HL2:E2 ends is just kind of very obviously something that wasn't *supposed* to be left there as a cliffhanger for ~6 years.

That's because TV sucks and this generation knows it. The internet allows *anyone* to suck at playing music with their friends and put it online.

fostok,AskReddit,1390867538.0,"Classical music is great to listen to for studying and reading in general. One of the reasons it's advised against listening to it while studying is that you begin to associate certain knowledge with certain pieces of music. By this I mean that if you were to hear the piece in an everyday context you might be reminded of what you were studying while you were listening to it (I know for a fact that one certain piece of music by Ludovico Einaudi reminds me of the book I was reading as I was listening to it)

Studying is done to prepare for an exam. In an exam you are surrounded by silence and have nothing to remind you of the music or item you were studying. This is why people recommend you to study in silence, so that you can simulate the exam conditions and hopefully be able to recollect the knowledge better as you prepared for it in the same conditions that you are using it in.

Lets start with abortion. Not aborting benefits no one. It's detrimental to the parents in that they have to raise a child they do not want and/or do not have the ability to raise adequately. And it's detrimental to the child who is being brought into life with parents who do not have the ability and/or will to raise them anywhere near optimally.

Would you want to be an unwanted child or a child who was loved and cared for by knowledgeable, loving parents?

Next we have ""spare a murderer"". So you've been brought into life and your circumstances (and maybe other contributing factors like biochemistry) have led you to endanger the lives of others. Oh boy, this would be a long one to fully get into, but we as a society failed this person so we should just kill them?

One of the main differences is that a fetus or even a new born baby is not yet a person that is cognizant of a will to live."

I'm a real man!!"". He'd show me pictures of guys and ask me if i thought they were cute. Then, he hacked into my myspace account and read all of my messages to see if I was cheating on him because I was ""being distant"". I was ""being distant"" because I was taking 5 AP classes and AP tests were coming up so I had to study every freaking spare second I had. 

This led to him basically emotionally abusing me. He would say things to me to make me feel guilty about not spending time with him. He wanted me to do things sexually with him that I didn't want to do and he would make me feel horrible about saying no to him. 

When I finally broke up with him, he followed me to Denny's, where I was with my friends, and told the waitress that it was my birthday. They had me stand up, sang to me, and then he started yelling at me in front of the whole restaurant and made up alllll these lies about me sleeping around and cheating on him and how much of a bad person I was.

Demon Wall - I'm missing something really important in this fight I think.  Mechanically, I'm fine - I have no issues dodging the centre/edge attacks or the repel, don't get knocked off or anything.

DPS wise, I'm fine - I can burn the bee things with no issue.  But every single time but once, I get suckerpunched something fierce just after the bees spawn.  It's not the Thunderstorm that's doing it, I can see that coming.  But shortly after they appear, I'm doing fine with topped off health and then suddenly I'm dead.  Is there a mechanic or some kind of attack that I don't know about?

The one time I have survived ... whatever this is... I had no issues completing the fight.  I have no issues leading up to this weird death.  Where am I screwing up?  

I've only ever been in DF for this dungeon, and it's never caused us to fail the dungeon, usually I've burned the bees and the wall enough by the time I die that the rest of the party can power through and we carry on our way with no more issues.

It's ... fairly engaging. I keep messing up the rules so instead I'll have to adjust a few things. I'll say it starts off slow but it's a timed game (XX number of turns in the game) and while you open up pretty solo-solitaire. It ramps up to a game where player interaction both mental and direct play a larger role. It is however not a point based game. It's more like a scavenger hunt and whomever has the gold card at the end of the game is the winner.

I trend to drip at the first hint of poor vapor production.  I became a lot easier with experience.

&gt;2- do I just remove the drip tip and drip in there or manually remove the whole top half and drip directly on the cotton?

Whichever works for you.  I always start a dry/clean wick with the top off, then just pull the tip to drip.  When I started I pulled the cap a lot to see what everything looked like and comparing to my experience.  I've gotten a lot better at telling when I've over-dripped and when I need to drip without looking.

&gt;3- wow the draw is airy. I have the two dots half covered and still it's an airy draw for me. Is it safe to cover them all totally or no?

You don't want to cover them all, you need airflow coming in on the coils.

&gt;4- my vapor production when I build dual coils never seem as good as it should be. My resistance is 1.7 but I get more vapor from my single coil builds. Any tips here?

I'm assuming you're not using a mech.  So the ""more clouds"" thing is pretty standard.  Lower resistance, higher power, more airflow, and more VG in your juice.  With a decent single or dual coil build I could easily max my SVD to it's 15 watts.  That's when I switched to a mech.

Though I use black pen and highlighters in lectures and then write it out neat in coloured pen afterwards. Oh and for examples/questions I highlight it yellow and leave it out of the second set of notes. The reason being that the lecturers usually upload the full worked solutions to the website so I don't need to write em out myself.

One thing I do that helps me a lot is to make flashcards. These are mainly for definitions, one side having the definition on, the other the question ""define ___"".
I also use them for simple questions or certain key equations. I make them through the course of a week and then at the end of the week after, I give myself a test on all of them. I use these much more often than my notes.

I also colour code my flashcards according to how difficult I find the thing to remember (black=easy, blue=medium, pink=hard) and revise the hardest ones first. I do this so that I don't waste time revising things that I find easy.

I had to go to wikipedia and confirm that was right, because I didn't believe it at first and I am still not totally convinced because well... wikipedia. Did I mention that there is no sea here? just rivers, bays and the ocean.

But there was something I found to sort of ease my conscience a bit. It's in The Hobbit that when the Dwarves emerged from Erebor they had singed beards, so the reason Thorin wears his beard short is in reverence to those Dwarves that died in the mountain, you know.

Gains are going to come slowly. The generally accepted maximum amount of muscle gain is 2 lbs. a month. You'll gain some fat and water weight as well. Assuming you eat 500 calories over your TDEE every day, you should gain ~5 lbs. a month (possibly more in the beginning, due to spikes in water weight and glycogen stores)."

                                   Samuel/Friend/McBean

               Zardes/Rogers              Keane           Donovan/Ishizaki

                                      Based Penedo/Rowe


Our second team alone would be a solid MLS squad for a few games at a time, and our back ups are definitely good enough to cover for injuries/the World Cup and drops in form; if we're just looking at the squad from a depth point of view we already have the deepest team in the league only rivaled by Seattle's attack and SKC midfield, as long as Samuel/Friend/McBean can win balls in the air for Keane (whose legs are just about done) and Donovan we'll be deadly going forward, Juninho and Sarvas are the best CM combo in the league already, and our back five has ass tons of depth and quality with Based Penedo (praise be upon him) making sure what few chances we concede don't get in.

That being said if we don't pick up Ishizaki and a DM we'll be properly fucked once Donovan is gone with the World Cup or if Juninho/Sarvas/Husidic goes down with an injury."

1wiseguy,space,1390868270.0,"You know, I really don't want to be adversarial. I just want to propagate knowledge about space stuff, and I feel like this is an area that's often misunderstood.

Let me explain this another way:

If you have a 1 million kg spacecraft, and you want to get it up to 10% of the speed of light, then it will take 450E18 J of energy. (0.5 * 1E6 kg * (30E6 m/s)^2)

That's about the equivalent of the total output of all the world's nuclear power plants running for 14 years. (I'm assuming 500 plants at 2 GW each, all running 24/7.)

Of course, you couldn't possibly fit those power plants in a 1 million kg spacecraft, nor could you convert all of the power into thrust, but this example goes to illustrate how impossible this would be.

My point is that it's really impossible, and there's nothing you can do about it. The only way you might create that much energy is with nuclear fusion, but that has proven to be challenging to harness, and has pretty much been abandoned as a power source."

Montuckian,Entrepreneur,1390868373.0,"I am not sure I'm in /r/entrepreneur.  Is everyone else really urging you to not start a business?

If you're business minded, start a business of your choice.

If you don't know what you want to do, go find entrepreneurs in your community and talk to them.  Sometimes you have to reach out directly, although other times you can find them at events and meetups.

The industry you're in doesn't really matter, to be honest.  Just because you like fishing doesn't mean that you're going to like selling fishing equipment or helping other people catch fish.

Find something where you like the process.  If that's the process of hauling around a pressure washer and going door to door for business, then do that.  If not, maybe do something else.  Just keep in mind that you'll likely have to work this job for quite some time, so make sure you like it.

Keep your living expenses low, or as low as possible.  Given your suggested businesses as well as Reddit's demographic, it would be my guess that you're fairly young.  If that's the case, don't take a salary right away, but rather keep your profits in the business.  Live on a set allowance and keep track of every dollar that you lend the company.

The biggest thing though is to try and possibly fail.  You may not figure out what you want to do until your business is a burned out failure.  Or you may start it and then decide to pivot.  Those are two paths to lessons that you won't have with it sitting in your retirement account."

So I think it's a great idea for the tank to mark (providing they are comfortable doing that without it affecting their main priorities) but every DPS worth their salt should be 100% comfortable operating without them.  If I ever end up tanking, I'll be marking for these reasons.  It's not something to harass people about though.

&gt;an unhappy look on her face

Show me her face.  Is she frowning?  Pouting.  Show me unhappiness, don't tell me.

&gt;Her spoon found something that resembled a potato, which she quickly fed to Jae Ly. 

Why is she feeding her sister when her sister has her own food?  This is awkward.

&gt;After they had both pushed down a few gray, tasteless bites, the girls’ uncle, Lednoc walked in arguing with an enormous bald man. 

You need another comma after Lednoc

&gt;the two girls took their bowls to the back of the room. They passed them through a small window 

So far I get the impression that we're in a pseudo-medieval world (swords, chain mail, etc), and this is not how dining works.  There would be servants, unless this is a very sparse military base, in which case I have a hard time believing two little girls would be allowed.

I'm really confused about Lednoc vs Lugar.  It seems like you jump between them.  Not sure what's going on there.

Overall, I have no idea what's going on in this story.  Who are the girls?  How old are they and why are they there?  Why doesn't their uncle care about them?  Where are they?  What is the wall and why is it important at all?

Nothing about this world or these characters sparks any interest for me.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1390868542.0,"Know yourself well, and respect yourself. Surround yourself with people who respect you for who you are. I know that sounds cliche, but it's especially easy as a teenager to have friends who want you to change this or that about you. Or maybe you want to change this or that about yourself to fit in. Ask yourself, am I doing this to be a better person or because I think it will make my life easier? Don't take the easy way out. Do what you think is right, and I don't mean just morally. I mean do what you think is best for you, and make friends who genuinely want what's best for you.  Take pride in what you are good at and what you enjoy even if it is ""uncool"". Better to be a band geek with two friends you can have genuine fun with than be popular and spend all your energy trying to fit an image. 

Back to the first step: know yourself. Read a lot, write a lot. Learn to articulate your thoughts. Know your weaknesses and own up to your mistakes. Know your strengths and get affirmation from yourself, not others. Follow through with what you say. Do good work no matter who is or isn't watching. Seek to learn from everyone, both kids and adults. Don't look adults as an obstacle to living how you want. They are your allies. Treat an ally like an ally and they will stay an ally. Treat an ally like an enemy and they will turn into an enemy.

I am not a medical professional at all so please take my advice with a pinch of salt. I also have no idea about German or US Army health practice's, it might be standard procedure to test for it during pregnancy. (I'd imagine so though I could be wrong.)

If I were you I'd talk to the doctor more about this, before you talk to your husband.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390869104.0,"Well I think what it does is validate your philosophy. The narrative around LBJ was he backs away from big moments and doesn't trust himself to win games. Then he won a championship doing exactly that and the whole narrative was reframed as ""he trusts his teammates"" etc.

It makes sense on a level, though. You can't just presume ""if he wins a ring"" because a large part of the criticism regarding 'Melo's game is that you **can't** win a ring being ""one-dimensional"" as he supposedly is. But if somehow you managed to discount the narrative around you by winning a ring (which just seems unlikely) then yeah suddenly the narrative (which is just a presumption) is shattered.

But in a different sense, it's idiotic because if you suddenly get very talented teammates who (eventually will) defer to you (Oh, I don't know, teaming up with a top-10 and a top-5 player at the time), then it becomes much more feasible to overcome the gaps in your game and win it all anyways."

ChangloriousBastard,Sacramento,1390869114.0,"In order to create more transparency with your program, I was hoping you could answer a few questions:

1.) In order to be eligible, applicants must be members of the metro chamber.  Membership costs at least $436 ($386 for ""investment"" and $50 for an application fee).  For a lot of nonprofits, that kind of expenditure is hard to justify. Would the Sac Metro be willing to waive or otherwise reduce fees for nonprofits?

2.) Most of the lobbying done by the Chamber has been geared towards reducing the tax burden on businesses.  Because most nonprofits are not taxed like for-profit businesses, do nonprofit members get the same advantages as for-profit members?  

3.) Many nonprofits are successful because of grant money provided by local, state and federal governments.  The US Chamber and Sac Chamber have both advocated for cutting areas of the budget that often provide grants to these nonprofits.  Am I incorrect in thinking that many actions taken by the Chamber serve to undermine well-meaning non profit groups?  


I apologize that these questions are so pointed, but it seems to me that this program could just be used as a way to entice nonprofits to become members of the Sac Chamber, a group that does not have non-profits in their best interest.  "

wolfkin,boardgames,1390869138.0,"well I can address some of that. Speaking towards ""how close you were"" either you can get that same satisfaction from retelling the game or you can't. It's like some variations of where wolf where you find out AFTER the game what role everyone was. Same here we all just recap where on earth we thought it was and where it actually was and such. The post game discussion is part of the enjoyment for me but i can see where others may want something more concrete.

As far as waundering. If you were to read [my write ups](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1104206/a-game-so-mysterious-we-assumed-it-was-broken) you may noticed that tended to happen. This however becomes moot when you actually cut out the tokens that I thought were too tedious and pointless to cut out (i was wrong). These tokens track where everyone goes. After an initial planet scouting. We all know someone has it so it becomes a reaction game seeing who is fighting and who looks (or acts happy). Man.. i still haven't cut those out. I need to do that. But basically if you play by the rules and use all the pieces you shouldn't have a game where you never see the gold card. Getting to it may not happen but any game I've played where someone never saw it was only because we messed up a rule. Or in my case I didn't use my alien power.

But hey I understand if you're on fief already so I'm just throwing out my knowledge. luck to you."

It really needs to be fixed at the structural level; even if half of the teachers in a school practiced this form of teaching, it wouldn't change the fact that the other half are still reflecting the teaching methods of those in power.

banana-tree,Turkey,1390869349.0,"&gt;during the independence war

Come on now, you're being intentionally misleading. The link talks about the Ottoman period as well, goes all the way to the 1982 constitution. I specified that I was talking about the period after the war, about the early years of the republic. Papers were closed after 1923 too (mostly after 1925 really), all through Atatürk's and İnönü's rule, and in especially the second half of Menderes' rule. I gave you names of two papers that were closed, but the list is long. In fact I looked up specific numbers now. 130 papers during Atatürk's time, 108 during İnönü's time, and 161 during Menderes' time. So again saying CHP never censored the press is blatantly false. Saying Menderes censored more is a valid point (if you're comparing it to individual leaders -- the CHP total amounts to 238 which is more than DP, of course).

&gt;Requests.

... where those who didn't follow them were fined or shut down.

&gt;unfair taxation

Exactly. That's the point. Thus the word ""lawful"" robbery.

&gt;arresting and prosecuting protestors who were violent

Not all those who were prosecuted were violent, and many members of the opposition were persecuted by being (sometimes unfairly) linked to violence - that includes journalists, for 'inciting rebellion'. That happens today as well. You're also intentionally avoiding the specific cases I cite.

&gt;making it sound like people were picked up from the streets and hung by a tree without trial.

I do think the courts and the special circumstances were abused at times, but (I don't know what it sounds like to you), I never claimed there were no courts. In fact, in the sentence you quoted I say that if you need to defend the courts, justifying what happened is more sensible than outright denying it. You didn't only make it sound like, but specifically said that he didn't hang or jail any protestors. That's clearly not true."

Thankfully I learned that the whole ""us versus them"" attitude is ridiculous, but it took a while.

3. Despite it clearly being socially awkward for her, she was direct and honest with you and didn't try to lie or hide it.

And 4. in response to the ""I'm not a product you can try before you buy"" argument, that's what dating *is*. And if you had a problem with dating non-exclusively you should've made that clear from the outset.

ernestborgnine2013,AlAnon,1390869619.0,"I hear you. It was my mom I was trying to maintain a relationship with too. My dad was abusive when we were younger and it made me respect him a whole lot less. 

The problem with maintaining a relationship with just my mom was how dependent on my dad my mom is... She won't come to visit me without him, for example. She won't pick up the phone and call me, and since he picks up the phone the majority of the time, I was forced to have awkward conversations with him. The other problem was that my mom would talk to me about my dad (how proud he was of me, etc.). Yet, he never expressed that to me-- not that I wanted that, all I wanted was him to stop being so depressing to be around. I never understood this until later in life, but what my mom was doing was passive agressively trying to keep my dad and my relationship going even though neither he nor I tried to communicate directly. It started to anger and stress me. Why would she use the time she had left in this world to work on his relationships with his kids when she could have worked on our relationship instead. I can honestly say mom hardly knows me anymore, because her focus has been on the internal workings of her family over the individual relationships she has with each kid. 

Anyway, I can't stand the negativity either. I had to also watch my sister turn into a meth addict, and see my dad sit there and watch it unfold. He finally came to me to request that we do an intervention, but by then she was reallly showing the advanced affects of the drug. I was mad that he didn't ask my mom to do it and get the ball rolling on his own and then ask me to participate. He was basically trying to get me to do it so he wouldn't have to lift a finger. I am not the parent!

It's sad what we both have to go through with our moms. But, I know for me I can't take responsibility for her anymore. She once told me as a kid that she would choose her husband over her kids, so for me, the decision was somewhat easier knowing that she thought such a thing about me. Parents are just people. There is nothing inherently magical about them. They can damage you a lot and all you want is to please them. Becoming an adult means seeing what is best for you and shedding that child's view."

I don't have a car and I have to take the bus everywhere and it is awful for me. But I know that if I sit/ stand up at the front and look out the window I feel better. I know I can always get off the bus and wait for the next one if I'm panicked. I always have money on me so I can take a taxi if I really can't do the bus that day.

If you make some plans, and they change, and you are anxious, know that you don't have to do the new plans. You can stay at home and cuddle in your jammies.

If you are going to a friends house, make sure you know where the bathroom is in case you need a minute to yourself. Or step outside, walk around the block, say you just needed some air, whatever, I'm sure your friends would understand if you told them the truth.

Going new places is hard but planning here helps again. Google streetview where you are going, read reviews of the places you are visiting.

I have a little bag in my purse that I bring with me everywhere that is like my 'anxiety emergency kit.' Bring things you like, and things that calm you down. For me, these are things that have to do with my senses. I have a little rollerball of my favourite perfume I bring with me everywhere and I put it on and smell it if I'm nervous. Pack of gum is good too, your favourite flavour. I bring my meds with me, and some makeuppy items to make me less sweaty (blotting papers and powder) or to clean up my makeup in case I have a cry. And I bring some hand cream too, just to rub on my hands and it feels nice and soothing. You could bring a small ipod or have calming music on your phone. Just take a minute. Listen to it and breathe. A picture of your friends and family to look at or a funny cartoon, or a calming ocean scene or anything nice that will make you happy.

What do you do for a living?  

Australia is a big, big place.  Being big, it's got heaps of different cities and places to be and do, depending on what you want to do here.

Saying that, travelling around is ridiculously easy unless you're thinking of living in the biggest cities (Sydney, Melbourne &amp; Brisbane).

In general:

- While we don't admit it, we're quite safety conscious.
- Alcohol consumption is probably our biggest social problem right now.
- Unemployment is low, but jobs tend to be focussed in areas.
- Our internet is not fantastic.
- Our health system IS fantastic, though I understand Canada enjoys a similar single-pay system.  Generally, you can get free or very inexpensive health care.

In terms of cities (these are ones I've lived in):

Sydney - Where the money is.  I don't like it, because it's too big and too hot.  If you want to make a career and you like a rat race though, go there.

Melbourne - Culture is better than Sydney, food is WAY better than Sydney, sport is rife.  Melbourne is easier to get around and has almost the same opportunities.

Hobart - Small, kinda folksy place that's trying hard to stay relevant.  I love it, because of how close things are and that getting to the mainland is not the barrier it once was.  Is probabyl closest in climate to Canada.

As a canadian, I think you can get a work visa, we have a Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, also the Immigration Department.  Google those and look them up, the DFAT website is pretty cool.

Have fun!"

I think the problem is that men have unfair treatment. You should fight to lower the punishment for men rather than raise the punishment for women.

I will shorten those cue points in the future. My main point of pride is that I used a loop on Pressure to quit Collision and load Come on! since I only have two decks. It was a creative solution. I also didn't use the sync button, but I was using the guide that shows you how far off the two songs are, so it's kind of like using the sync button.

2.Trigger by MyBack

3.Torrent by Sidney Samson &amp; Martin Garrix

4.Collision by Ferry Corsten &amp; Bassjackers

5.Come On by Audiobastardz

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390870230.0,"I'm going to come from a different angle on this.

Many of these ""humane"" treatments are good not just so the animal can live a ""happy"" life, but also because they protect the health of the animal we consume.

Inhumane treatments that pack animals in so tightly they can't move   mean they are packed in their own feces they can't get out of. Which  can cause contamination of the meat we eat, and means it gets washed in ammonia, also not good for us. (and not necessary if the the carcasses entering the facility aren't covered in shit).

Free range (actual free range, not just let out for an hour a day) chickens make different eggs than cooped up chickens because they eat a different diet. Chickens that get to run around and eat what they want eat bugs and grubs. Chickens pinned up in coops they can't move in not only live in their own fifth and the rotten remains of dead chickens, but also eat whatever cheap grain diet they are fed.

With fast food, it's fast paced, a fuck-ton of little things that need to get done and done *precisely*, and let me tell you, the customers half the time are pieces of work. WE do have a few customers that we honestly love - but I find the customers with fast food to be worse than when I was in retail.

My personal theory is that Bruce calls himself Batman in his head because he thinks that Bruce died in the alley with his parents. But when Jason died, and when Clark died, it wasn't Batman crying for fallen allies. It was Bruce crying for fallen friends.

The cowl is just as much of a disguise as the $10k suits and playboy lifestyle. The difference is that Bruce is so committed to the cowl disguise that he even fools himself.

In my mind, the reason Alfred, Clark, and the Bat-family call him Bruce is to remind him that deep, deep down, he isn't justice personified. He's still a man. And that's a good thing."

At the risk of being deliberately inflammatory (because I think the Consitution, so far as I've read it, is otherwise a brilliant set of principles on which to base a country), the Constitution shouldn't have force simply because it always has; changing to suit modern times is necessary.

It's a tragic fact that children - immature and sometimes with significant mental health issues - are finding it far too easy to find and use weapons in America.

In countries where such restrictions already exist - like Australia - this doesn't seem to be happening.

I also note that doesn't include a requirement to have them stored safely, registered, and otherwise limited in their application, only that the US government can't impede on a citizen's right to arm themselves."

Intensity and TC are the tricky parts.  Try starting off with I at 18 and TC at 26624.  From there increase intensity to 20 and see how you're doing.  If that's good then you can try increasing the TC in increments of 1024 to get to a point where you have good hashing and a stable system.

You are compelling your players to *fight you for control of their character.* Ironically by trying to put roleplaying first, you are damning yourself to more metagaming, enforced under the threat of restricted player freedom.

TheOtherKav,tall,1390870553.0,"&gt;What are some things you wish you had known before you bought the boat and ""moved in"", so to speak?

**I've never really thought about that. But I do keep learning things as I go along. The big thing is be humble, and have an open mind.**

&gt;How did you learn to sail, since you've said you had no prior experience?

**I have friends that sail, and the last owner spent a few days with us on the delivery cruise. He showed me the ropes, and gave me a crash course in sailing.**

&gt;What drew you to this particular boat/style of boat, over something more modern or something bigger/smaller?

**She's an early fiberglass boat with a full keel. Back when fiberglass was new builders were not sure how strong it was. So those early boats were very overbuilt. And as such *very*  strong. The full keel helps if you run aground. The waters here tend to have unmarked sholes. I've hit two where I ran hard aground and had to wait for the tide to lift me off. They say here: ""you're not boating if you've never run aground.""**

&gt;How did you begin the process of finding the boat, and how far was your search radius once you started looking?  I assume lots of online research and maybe something like autotrader but for boats?

**I checked [SailboatListings.com](http://Sailboatlistings.com), [YachtWorld.com](http://www.yachtworld.com/) and whatever I could find locally. I'm in NC, and I looked from FL to VA for boats in my price range. One rule I had was to always be able to walk away from a deal. That was helpful because it let me not feel pressured into getting something *right now*. Also I would not even look at a boat unless it had a current survey that was less than 12 months old, and readily available for me to review by the seller. I did not bother with a broker, and I paid cash for my boat.**"

If you do come back (bucket list, whim, whatever) here's [the schedule](http://amishamerica.com/lancaster-county-mud-sales-2014/) for this year. 

Also, for some reason, they have towns named Intercourse, Blue Ball, Pleasure Gap.  Seriously. 

If you're interested in Gettysburg, you'll be within an hour's drive of there as well - but the weather is raw, and there are few shelters.  

Also, pay attention if you're flying into Harrisburg... you will fly very close to Three Mile Island. The one that started to melt down? Yep, that's the one.
Snap a picture for your friends back home. 

(don't take pictures of the Amish - they think it's rude) 

Welcome, and enjoy - it's an interesting area with a lot of neat quirks. "

I'm a Christian and so is my family and seeking comfort from God and my family/close friends really helped me. 

I also talk about him constantly and have pictures of him around my house. I feel like that's a huge thing. You need to talk about it. You need to cry. You need to get angry. You can't just sweep it under the rug and pretend like it didn't happen. That's how deep depression happens and it just jacks you up big time. You just have to let it out when you are feeling upset.

Geohump,todayilearned,1390870921.0,"It has long been known that pitbull's have very nice personalities and are much less aggressive than certain other breeds.

However, despite the fact pit bulls are very sweet dogs, on those occasions when they do attack, unlike other breeds, they do not break off the attack. Whether it is instinct or training I don't know. To some degree I think it might be instinct because I have seen videos of pit bulls attacking other dogs, where they constantly re-gripped the other dogs neck, and would keep shaking the other animal by the neck. In these videos, the apparent owner of the pit bull looked like a normal average everyday person, not some kind of criminal who had deliberately trained the dog to attack.

The final piece of the puzzle is that the statistics shown on the government websites on dog attacks show that, although pit bulls attack less often, they are still responsible for more deaths and injuries when they do attack. In other words they are simply more fatal, more of the time. So despite the fact that they are less likely to start an attack, they are more likely to finish it by killing the person or animal.

Sadly, we humans created this breed of wonderful animals to be used primarily to help control bulls while farmers worked on them. For example while castrating a bull. Naturally a bowl is going to be rather recalcitrant and uncooperative during this activity, and so pit bulls were developed to control the ball, if I recall correctly by holding the bull's nose in their mouth. And I assume not gently.

So now we have this artificial, human created breed which no longer has a place in the world, but which, inadvertently, and not due to the dog's personality, but it's capabilities, is rather dangerous.

In the United Kingdom they have decided to end the breed by not allowing them to be reproduced any anymore. All pit bulls owners, (Staffordshire Terriers and related breeds) in the UK, have to apply for a special permit just to keep their pit bulls/Staffordshire Terriers. And all of them have to be sterilized.

This seems to me, while a sad thing, to be an appropriate solution. This does not kill any animals, it just doesn't allow anymore of that breed to be made.

So yes, while Chihuahuas and terriers are more likely to bite someone, they are much less likely to press an attack, and even if they did, well, they simply don't have the same ability to do damage."

Obviously you wouldn't want to add it to your worm bin, but it might make your life easier in other ways.

I've also heard quite a few recommendations for the [deep litter method](http://www.backyardchickens.com/a/deep-litter-method-the-easiest-way-to-deal-with-chicken-litter-dlm). With this, you essentially compost the pine shavings on the spot, occasionally adding a fresh layer of shavings as needed. You can get the chickens to help turn the compost by throwing some treats down on top of the litter.

As I've read, sand works better if you need the coop floor to stay dry (e.g., if it is made of wood) and don't mind scooping poop for a few minutes each day. Deep litter works better if you'd rather do a thorough clean once or twice a year (basically, dig up all the composted mulch and relocate to the garden), and moisture against the coop floor isn't a big concern. Sand is also better for outside areas, and shavings are better for cold-weather insulation, and they *can* be used in combination (sand below to keep the floor dry, deep litter shavings above to absorb poo and keep things warm)."

But they knew what they were doing and actually got quite a bit of value back (an expiring contract = Kwame + a raw prospect in Marc Gasol who panned out nicely).

There's a good chance the GM knew exactly what he was doing (maybe he was high on Dragic, for good reason) and that everyone is too short-sighted to see what the GM actually saw. Read Dan Gilbert's letter to Stern about vetoing the CP3 deal and you'll realize the motivation of blocking the deal probably was less about what's best for the Hornets and more about what's worst for the Lakers.

The French seem to view life as something to be enjoyed and everything should be ordered to accommodate this, whereas our attitude seems to be strict adherence to rules even if we're unhappier as a result.

For example, food is something to be savoured and good food appreciated, at least in France. For us, as long as it's good enough that's all that matters.

The_Canadian,firstimpression,1390871223.0,"&gt;You are a bit socially awkward, but you're fun to be around and to have around. Can be pretty goofy at times, but that's not all you are about. You have more depth than people give you credit for.

Pretty much it. 

&gt;But the thing is, if I put in in a room of 100 people, you're not the smartest, the strongest, the funniest, the best scrabbles player... the hardest drinker... in fact, there's nothing about you that is superior to anybody else in that room. You're the quintessential ""average"" guy, but you're our buddy. We won't double date with you, but we'd watch a game or a movie with you.

I'd say this is pretty close and applies to the majority of people. I'm getting a degree in chemistry, so I must be relatively smart on average. 

&gt;I think you like action/adventure movies.

Yep. 

&gt;Iron man 3 was the best movie out last year for you. 

Haven't seen that yet. I loved the first one!

&gt;You have tried playing D&amp;D before, but then, the DM or another player went overboard in the role playing aspect of the game and so you quit when you had an excuse.

Actually, I haven't played that. I don't really game much. 

&gt;you are the... cable guy... cashier at a coffee shop... video game tester... probably hard working, but doing a low wage job. You can move up, but you do not have much ambition. You're definitely not getting the recognition you deserve at work but you're fine with that because you think a job is not half bad and its low stress (for you anyway).

This part isn't quite there. I have a job (a few part time ones), but all are above minimum wage. The 3D model job I started makes $35/hr. I have ambition. I'm getting a degree in chemistry, and taught myself 3D computer modeling, so I'm not exactly lazy. 

&gt;You laugh at all the pun jokes and the advice animals on Reddit.

Occasionally. The best puns are science puns, though. 

&gt;You were probably too young to have voted for Obama in his first term, but you definitely voted for Obama in the 2nd term. But I'm 50-50 on whether you had bothered to vote at all.

As a Canadian Citizen living in the US, I can't vote. I'm not sure exactly how I would have voted. Highly likely for Obama, as I don't care at all for Romney. 

Overall, pretty good!"

CaspianX2,patientgamers,1390871237.0,"As for my take on Chrono Cross:

**What it got right**: The game had some of the best graphics on the PSOne, and an absolutely beautiful soundtrack. In addition, while not quite fitting in with the character designs of the original game, the character designs of Chrono Cross were relatively interesting and original. If RPGs were judged purely on their aesthetics (and for a while it seemed like they pretty much were), Chrono Cross would have been an absolute success.

**What it got wrong**:

**Characters** - While Chrono Trigger took a group of stereotypical characters and gave them depth and soul, making them grow out of their tired tropes into a more three-dimensional cast, Chrono Cross did exactly the opposite. It took a *wildly* diverse cast of characters and made them all cookie-cutter *boring*.

With a paltry few exceptions, characters in Chrono Cross didn't have personalities, they had accents and verbal tics. And while each character in Chrono Trigger had a unique connection with every other character, characters in Chrono Cross didn't really give a shit about each other, aside from a few characters' attraction to Serge.

This is symbolized by the near-lack of combo techs, which in this game have been pushed into ""Easter egg"" territory (while in the original they were a core part of the battle system), but it's really just an extension of the lack of development in the characters themselves. Korcha doesn't think anything about Poshul, who doesn't think anything about Lucky Dan, who doesn't think anything about Lucia. At best these characters will get a one-line response from whoever's in your party, but the sentiment is always virtually the same, just translated into whatever accent of verbal tic the character may have.

The same went for battles, too - it didn't matter who you brought with you, as their character traits didn't really affect the flow of battle all that much anyway. If anything, you might pay attention to their elemental color, but even that was unnecessary most of the time (see ""the battle system"" farther down).

**The story** - Needlessly convoluted and angsty, Chrono Cross also places the burden on explaining just what the hell is going on on the very last hour or so of the game, and some things are *never* satisfactorily explained. How did Serge and Lynx swap bodies, again? Let me guess... a wizard did it. Oh, just replace ""wizard"" with ""frozen flame"".

But the problem isn't just that the explanations for the game's ridiculous plot are too much or too little or in the wrong place. It's that the game's plot stretches credulity to the breaking point, sets the pieces on fire, and then pisses on the ashes.

Okay, so Lynx is a computer AI in a cat's body (for some reason) from an extra-dimensional scientific facility on the edge of time (or somesuch), and also, apparently, Serge's father. Oh, and a while ago he tried to kill Serge as a baby, for reasons that aren't really very well fleshed-out, and then burned down an orphanage, for reasons that are never explained, but probably just because he's evil. His sidekick, who is inexplicably dressed as a harlequin (and thus of course named Harle), and whom Lynx has no real reason to associate with, is also a dragon in disguise, following Lynx in hopes to access said facility, and apparently deciding, once the body swap happens, that it's a better idea to start following Serge in Lynx's body instead of Lynx in Serge's body. Lynx's plan, of course, *hinges* upon this body swap happening, but he has no way of knowing that Serge will actually *be* there with him to make the body swap, and at best hopes that his connection with Kid will make him blindly tag along with her on her hunt for him.

Are we *really* calling this a good story?

**Crapping on the legacy** - Hey, I've got an idea! How about we take something a lot of people liked and then make a sequel! We'll pick something fun and lighthearted that everyone has warm, fuzzy memories about... and then *we'll use what they love against them*!

Did you like Crono and Marle? It's implied that they died when the Porre military (wait, what Porre military?) invaded Guardia. Did you like Lucca? Killed for no damn good reason while she protected innocent children in an orphanage. Robo? His AI was cruelly deleted by this game's villain. Ayla? Not even deserving a mention. Frog? Hey, let's tease people with a character named Glenn who's totally not Frog, yet uses the Masamune and has a lot of shit in common with Frog. But he's not Frog. Magus? Hey, let's confuse the fuck out of people by including a character, Guile, who actually *was* Magus in the Japan-only title Radical Dreamers, but in this game appears to have no relation to Magus.

But at least we found out what happened to Schala, right? Right?

At the very least the game has the good grace to write itself out of series history with a ""this never actually happened"" ending, as apparently the two timelines were wiped clean when they combined into a third. And on that note...

**The ending** - Okay, so first, there is no fucking way that most people figured out the way to get the game's ""true"" ending on their own. If you think it's reasonable to expect gamers to hear musical notes during a battle and think ""I know! I'll use them to play the chorus of the game's ending theme!"", I don't *ever* want you to be a game designer.

But that aside, what happens when you *do* get the ""Real ending""? You get a non sequitir video of a girl walking on train tracks. Wait, what? I guess the girl is supposed to be Schala/Kid, and it's supposed to be implying that she's searching for Serge in the rejoined timeline or... something...?

**The battle system** - There was a strategy to Chrono Cross's battle system, but most of the time, there was little reason to make use of it. For most enemies, a plain brute force approach worked just fine. Now, that's not too damning, because that described a large percentage of other RPGs of the era. However, it was insulting to be given a zillion different options when 90% of the time it didn't really matter what you picked.

**The battle theme** - Chrono Cross had an awesome battle theme. In the demo for the game, it was the music that played almost the entire time, and that was fine, because it was bad ass. But in the final version of the game, they decided to make it the boss music, and swapped in *the most annoying music in the game*, ensuring that the one song you would hear the most often, the one that would fire up every time you got into a battle, was one that made your ears bleed. Ugh.

.

Sure, Chrono Trigger was a tough act to follow. But the folks making Chrono Cross seemed to not only not *want* to follow it, but to actively *punish* everyone who liked the first game.

You could argue that my nostalgia for Chrono Trigger is painting my opinion of Chrono Cross, but I firmly believe that the game would still be *deeply flawed* even without the greater context of having played Chrono Trigger. One of the most beautiful games on the PSOne, certainly, but horribly flawed nonetheless."

Username20x6,comicbookmovies,1390871252.0,"To be fair, there's a difference in performing a play and making a film based on a comic book. If somebody put on a performance of Hamlet, set in modern times, where it turns out Claudius was actually an actor pretending to be a king and somebody else murdered Hamlet Sr. or somebody did a performance of Fiddler on the Roof with a new character made up played by Christopher Walken it would be extremely odd but it really isn't in a comic book movie. This is because what Samuel Beckett believed was that a play isn't a complete work of art unless it's performed but a comic book or graphic novel is. Alan Moore's Watchmen and Zach Snyder's film adaptation are two separate works of art so it's okay that they have two different endings, which would be an oddity on stage. It's okay for an artist to change the meaning behind a story because it's their own interpretation. 

Edit: I'm not saying it's not okay for a performance to change interpretation or meaning of the stage play because I do not adhere to Beckett's idea. In creating a performance of his play they have every right to add meaning where there is none since there are creating a separate work of art, merely using Beckett's play as a basis."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390871278.0,"&gt;vetoing a trade that would have made the lakers (even more of) a contender

That's the problem, isn't it? The deal's vetoing seemed basically predicated on stopping the Lakers from being contenders. It was **not** what was best for the Hornets. If you have a competent GM/FO without the obvious conflict of interest, then you'd think they would be able to determine what's best for the Hornets. But as representative of the owners, Stern had a chance to actually stop the Lakers from forming another superteam (after the Heat) and he took it.

Why shouldn't Laker fans be angry? The best player the Hornets could have gotten (besides AD after sucking) was Dragic, and that was in the Laker deal. The GM probably had a long-term vision in mind (reminds me of the Pau deal, which Pop wanted vetoed), but Stern's vetoing had less to do with the Hornets than with the Lakers. That's just absurd.

edit: Ah, I revisit this thread to the tune of 12 downvotes. I'd like a reasonable response instead of anonymous downvotes, because for me it seems like you're not too happy about someone arguing against the narrative /r/nba has collective constructed about the CP3 deal.

You're not the only one who's rethought the prospect of having kids after all this. I did two unsuccessful IVFs, and my meeting with an egg donor coordinator was incredibly disheartening. I did start to have second thoughts, but I'm also not coming from the same place you are. My husband and I sat on the fence for eight years, wondering if we wanted to try or not. He had never wanted kids, and I knew that going in, so I had just assumed we never would. I was fine with that.

Having to do IVF made us both decide that we were all-in, we definitely wanted to have kids. He's said that in 20 years, he thinks he would regret not having done it, so we're still pursuing options, starting with switching doctors. But I think we've both wondered if we wouldn't be just as happy if we were child-free. It isn't our first choice, but we could be happy that way.

It's really hard, especially when the prospect of donor gametes comes into play. But it sounds like you have a wonderful, strong marriage, and I'm so glad for you that you have it!

flashmedallion,ffxiv,1390871504.0,"It's a tough one for me because the part I like about games is learning how to solve challenges.  This is part of the reason I've avoided MMOs like the plague up until now - looking up the game ahead of time and learning what to do has become inherent to the genre.  My original thinking was: Why would I buy a game and then google how to beat it before I play it?  

People talk about how easy FFXIV is, but of course something is easy if someone else has worked out the nuances of how to negotiate a challenge and then you read that.  

Part of the fun for me is, I dunno, realising you have to destroy the Nail before Ifrit does his thing.  Realizing that you can't cure that debuff in Aurum Vale... but there's fruit here for some reason.   Oh cool, the fruit heals that.  Oh shit, the fruit doesn't grow back so fast - hey Healer, how many of these stacks can you handle on us before we eat this fruit?  It's a collaborative, problem solving experience.

But, I've stuck with FFXIV because I wanted to expand my gaming horizons a little bit and really understand this whole MMO thing.  Now, for better or for worse, there's no way in hell I'll go into a fight without preparing for it.  I did DF King Mog last night for the first time, and yeah, I'd only scanned a couple of guides on my phone but, and the important ""but"" here, is that I had a much better idea of what the *other players* would be doing and what *they'd expect me to be doing*.

Not so much the fight itself, but the other players.  Normally I'd prefer to go in fresh with some friends who were all going in fresh and we'd experience it together.  But going into DF changes the game a little and I don't think it's fair on other people to go in there completely blind.  I'm not going to feel ashamed for failing or making a mistake with something I'm not *experienced* with... but running in there and then jumping around like a fish on land trying to work things out is just a burden on everyone and not really a learning experience for me.

I'm kind of lucky in that I can pick these things up pretty quickly - we won the fight first go and I didn't die and I felt like I contributed (got a couple of commendations which is always nice as a DRG).

But to answer the question, as a complete rookie to MMOs, I've changed my tune.  I think if you are going to do content with other people (**especially a random group**) there is an obligation for you to at the very least find out what is expected of you and what your party will be doing, even in a rough sense.

If you want to learn the content yourself, it's your responsibility to find a group of people willing to learn it with you.  I'm unlucky in that a couple of the guys in my original group of four have the attention span of a drunk otter so my preference is no longer an option, but I'm not willing to shirk my responsibility to learn content ahead of time when playing with random other people."

Be up front about her size/shape.. Put up at least one full length picture.   You should help her find what of her wardrobe shows her figure off to its most flattering.   

I find women who are carrying extra weight have to go further in pictures because what's unbearably overweight to one person is pleasingly curvy to another person.  

So why categorize yourself.. show them instead.   

If she's got any active pursuits she enjoys, find/take pictures of her doing them.  I find it really helps to show off that someone is active and engaged in healthy activities no matter what size they are.

*Orville's body turning as he swings the statue manages to narrowly avoid the brunt of Zenith's attack, the sword scraping against the side of his chest plate. Time slows down as he sees the scene before him. Zenith and Cotorona attacking him both, even though he was trying to help Zenith, the Marines bearing down on him even though he's just trying to save the innocent citizens of Crickhollow. They have painted him as an enemy even though they had a common goal, looking at him and his friends for what they are instead of who they are, pirates, nothing more.*  
  
""IF YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO MY WORDS, LISTEN TO MY ROAR, AND KNOW FEAR!""  
  
*From the bottom of his feet, Orville feels power flowing through him, ascending through his legs, chest, arms, and even up to the head, feeling stronger and more energized, as if the earth itself is lending him power to aid his righteous cause. He grins, slamming his fist on the ground, creating a shockwave. The bullets shot at Orville are deflected by the great force as it pushes against both Orville's enemies and allies alike. Going at new levels of strength he's never felt, Orville rides the wave, lunging with the headless Marine statue at Cotorona, using it like a battering ram. In this moment, Orville is a force of nature*  
  
**Ron**  
  
*Ron prepares several fireworks to launch at his large, mace-wielding assailant, but the shockwave goes him off balance and his shots miss his intended foe, the rest headed at Zenith.*
  
**OOC:** So basically, two things are happening here with Orville's action, both of which can be read [on Orville's wiki page,](http://grand-line-roleplay.wikia.com/wiki/Orville#Combat) but I'll explain anyway. First is the technique ""Roar of the Earth"", which creates a powerful shockwave. The second is the passive effect of the Boots of Shackles Orville won from the Mind Maze activating.

Geohump,AskMen,1390871714.0,"The inverse square law.

Basically what this means is the more a body weighs, the less surface area it has per pound to cool it.

So for each pound a man weighs, he has less skin to cool that portion of his body. Effectively he has less radiating surface for each pound that he weighs that a female does.

Of course, on average, males are larger and heavier than females. But all the above statements may not be true for a specific individual man or woman. We are speaking only about average sizes.

Another issue is the difference in tissue type. Men are slightly more likely to have muscle mass than women are. Women may have a slightly higher average of fat compared to muscle. In muscle tissue tends to burn more energy than fat tissue does, which results in keeping the body warmer.

So these two things combined mean that on average men will feel slightly warmer than women feel, on average.

How do you fix this? There are several techniques. For example you could wear more sweaters, or you could try weightlifting which would reduce the amount of fat, and increase the amount of muscle tissue on your body, as well as increasing your general mass. The nice thing about weightlifting is that even though it might make you weigh more, your body will be smaller. With weightlifting you can actually go down a dress size, at the same time your strength, and the amount you weigh goes up."

Technology still advanced, art was still created (some of the greatest), and intercultural trade picked up. And yes, I think you get onto the thin ice in the ""power and culture"" department, particularly because when you are trying to assess the civilization that's held up culturally as the ideal of civilization, it's hard to escape that framework as opposed to seeing it, say, as those annoying nogoodnicks on the edge of the Persian empire who keep sending colonies everywhere because their land's too poor to feed themselves, at least until they become politically unified and start conquering everything.

outside of any physical discomfort or pain of the parent the ""Lost potential"" is no more tragic than lost sperm or eggs. and the sentient loss/experience/suffering of the actual baby/fetus  is no greater than that of  a chicken. 

I also view the death of a baby or child as less tragic than the death of an adult, because adults are more developed and leave a larger hole, a baby or child hasn't fully developed so the loss is less.

wrt to lost potential, there will always be new children so the loss of life/experience will be replaced, and the ""Uniqueness"" of one life to the next is less for children and babies than adults.

honestly news stories  of babies or children dying, affect me far less than adults dying.

I think the best reason to show you it matters if for you to buy two dozen eggs (or 1/2 dozen, if you can get them). One package the cheap eggs. One package (whatever the cost) from a local farm that you've looked up and see the chickens run around.

Crack one or two eggs of each in separate container, see if they don't look different. (they do.)

Cook them separately. See if they don't taste different. (they do.)

Then, on different days, eat first one kind, then the other.

See if the free range local eggs don't fill you up faster and satisfy you more.

For my family I find we go through almost half the eggs when we get good ones. (so almost twice the eggs when we get cheap ones.)

Also, the cheap eggs give us all really bad gas the local eggs don't.

The proof is in the pudding on this. They ARE different.

My brain has this weird thing where I'm confident as fuck with friends and people I'll never meet. (Like loudly breaking out into Defying Gravity in the main street of town at lunchtime). But as soon as someone is a potential, I lose all confidence to start with. 

&gt;Walk up to them confidently and just say ""Hey hows it goin?""  

This is where again my brain goes into self-destruct mode. ""Oh shit, she saw me and now I have to say something, fuck, she knows I paused so she knows I'm awkward and I'll get rejected. Nah, time for another beer. Oh hi Nick!"", and I wander off into the darkness and avoid seeing them again. Or ""crap, I haven't been seen, now how do I get her attention. Shit now she's with her friends...I'll just grab another drink."" Or even the usual, ""why would she want to speak to me? What do I say, 'hey how's it going?' sounds like I know her, but what else can I say?! Yeah lets just forget about her and grab another beer..."".

It isn't logical at all, but it's how my brain likes to think.

Heliopteryx,explainlikeimfive,1390872286.0,"I don't know anything about computers, but DNA ""does"" things through a process called transcription and translation. The double helix is temporarily unwound and the DNA is split (like a zipper). Enzymes attach to the DNA and produce a piece of RNA based on the sequence of nucleotides in the DNA. This RNA strand is called messenger RNA (mRNA), and it travels out of the nucleus in order to be made in to proteins. Structures called ribosomes bind together amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) in the sequence indicated by the mRNA, with every 3 nucleotides coding for an amino acid. 

The proteins then go off to do whatever it is they do in the body. "

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1390872645.0,"I understand... adjusting asset allocations between stocks and bonds.  With a 25 P/E, that means pre-inflation earnings yield is 4%.  Compare that to bond yields of 3%, and evaluate the risk of equities vs. bonds, and you have the crux of the argument.  In order to anticipate earnings greater than 4%, you require either an improvement on earnings (already at a 50 year high), and/or increased earnings multiple (already 50% above mean, and quite high from a historical perspective).  In a very strong economy, either would be possible.  As it stands, I am betting we see 1200 before we see 2000 (feel free to mock me if I am wrong).  OTOH, the one thing that could completely destroy that thesis is if the fed allows a sustained period of high inflation (seems like it's already happening in food...), in which case we will see ever-increasing nominal stock valuations, but they will still provide poor inflation-adjusted returns.

Personally, I do 'time' the market with some of my investments (if I own something that is grossly overvalued, I sell it.  if I see something I like that is selling for considerably less than what it's worth, I'll buy it).  I am of the (unpopular here) belief that the core of investing is paying less for productive assets than they are worth.

I feel if you aren't that busy and can stay at home and relax seeing if it works out for you, before the Dr.'s appointment is a good option, but if you have a busy week and the side effects are going to make it worse then just stop taking it and talk to the Dr about your concerns.

Mahhrat,AskReddit,1390872903.0,"Minecraft.

Seriously though, think about it.

Our protagonist awakes on a lonely landscape, with no idea how he got there or what he's doing.

Wandering around, he starts building himself a shelter, but is forced into a cave his first night there by hulking monsters that sSSSssss-BOOM their way through his first house or two.

Slowly, through trial and error, the hero figures out his landscape, culminating in a giant tower that looks suspiciously like a dick and balls.

One day, bored with his accomplishments, he sets off into the earth, digging down until he discovers a hidden temple, filled with spiders and treasure.

Discovering the magical *redstone* he realises the power of the gods themselves.

He sets off into the wilderness, eventually coming across a peaceful tribe who are happy to have him around yet hide at night from the zombie hordes.

He builds a mighty wall around the village along with a sophisticated lighting system that pushes back the evil zombies.

Worshipped as a God, he builds a temple on the hill above the settlement.

Days later, having again dug into the earth, he discovers the means to portal into another dimension.  Exploring there, he uncovers pig men, fiery beasts, and eventually, a dragon that nearly kills him.

Determined to end the threat to his beloved tribespeople, he venturs back and defeats the dragon!

The movie ends with a celebration of the Mario Theme played on an automated piano built by the redstone.

The credits show him inviting others to view his world, where he's immediately griefed, his tribe slain and his castle turned into a dick and balls."

This is primarily because the financial burden of raising a citizen is met in their home country (i.e education), and their non productive years are usually spent in their home country too, (retirement drawing a state pension), and so they spend their prime productive years adding to the UK economy, without incurring any of the major costs.

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1390872919.0,"Wow, you really got into this.

This isn't a debate class, and I don't care to get into a meta argument about logical fallacies. Especially since you use logical fallacies too.

&gt;I like how you chose one quote to take out of context and then tried to manipulate it to make it seem like I'm letting the girl off for what she did. Is that how logic works?

See, that's one right there, but I am not going to look up which one it is, you can if you care.

&gt;I call bullshit.

Good for you. Since you weren't there, and I haven't given you more than a few words describing the relationship, you don't even have enough information to call bullshit. I am sure that is a logical fallacy too. Pretending you know enough about something to express an informed opinion on it when you actually don't. Sounds like bullshit to me. So I guess I call bullshit on your calling bullshit.

&gt;I am asserting that you sought out a relationship similar to a psuedo-boyfriend

Surprise! We started as normal friends and it evolved on it's own! It is always interesting how people are so ready to tell me what I thought, wanted, or did, without asking me first. I guess you know about me the same way I know that you have blue hair and a nipple piercing.

&gt;And why are you bringing the OP into this? He hasn't said anything about you; it's mandano.

A legitimate error, thanks for correcting that. Sorry OP! I guess I get a bit upset when people who don't know anything about me start judging my value as a person, calling my a psycopath, and stuff like that. I grabbed the wrong name. It's a nitpicky thing to use as an argument though. 

&gt;Well yeah, if you're just going to buck societal convention and say who the fuck cares, every relationship is whatever the people involved make of it, nobody else should have any say in any way a relationship progresses, then fine. But then why the FUCK are you in a relationship advice sub if that's what you believe?

That is actually a great question! I am glad you asked. There is a lot more about relationships than what rules you and your partner agree to. Things like how to know if you are actually in love, what to do when you run into communication problems in your relationship, how to deal with differences in personality or values, how to be honest, how to interact with your partner in a constructive manner that doesn't just exacerbate the problem. Just as a few examples. Something tells me you didn't actually want an answer though, that you were just saying that to make me realize that you were so smart and right, but instead it just made me think that you didn't really think that argument through because a relationship is so much more than just the rules that you assign to it.

&gt;Again, if that's the way you feel, gtfo out of a place that is trying to give you guidelines for how to relationship properly. You're just trolling at this point.

You know, contrary to your belief, there isn't just one way to have a relationship. Now you know!

&gt;Are you judging my social and moral means of making me feel good about myself? Are you trying to impose your own social and moral values upon me? Gosh, I wonder what you had to say about that earlier.

Sorry, I was just trying to communicate in terms that you would understand."

She's done exactly what he wanted her to do, demonstrating a level of maturity and discipline that I don't even have at 34 years old, and not letting her have the reward she's worked so hard for will un-teach everything she's learned...not to mention destroying her trust in him.

This is the best outcome any parent could have hoped for. I mean to do something similar with my kids and if they do what yours has done I'll be laughing giddily all the way to the store. I'd be happier than they would. Because this goal is developmentally appropriate and getting this reward will teach her either 1. she'd rather have had the money or to buy something else, or 2. confidence and self-esteem through accomplishing difficult things, and that doll will be her most prized possession -- not just a doll, but a symbol of achievement and pride. 9-10 years down the line she'll be working her ass off for her own car; 20 years and she'll have a house at an age where her friends are thinking about starting to save a down payment later. *Unless* she is then told ""nevermind, all your hard work was for nothing, you're getting this thing that you don't want."" Then she'll learn that there's no point in working hard and she has to hide what she wants from her dad because he doesn't care about her point of view.

I'd hold that doll sacred, no punishment can touch it. It's *hers* in a way that nothing else is. She worked her ass off for it and the worst possible thing he could do would be to take that dream away from her. 

He wanted her to learn self-control. What he didn't realize is that she already has. He didn't account for the possibility that she might not *need* to make the mistakes he expected. If she already knows the lesson about not buying things you don't really want, why force her to make the mistake? "

If she invited you, it means one of two things: she is either serious about working out, or wants to get in your pants.

In the latter case, you might be forced to dial down your workout just because she might be more interested in socializing or having you show her things than actually working out. 

Giving her the benefit of the doubt and assuming she wants to actually train, then push each other. No body who works out gets derailed by worrying about how much better someone else is.

sorator,askgaybros,1390873225.0,"I'm in a similar position as you, just without the backlash (thus far). In my opinion there's nothing wrong with having preferences, you just have to be careful with what terms you use to express them. And this particular one can be difficult to express in neutral terms, which is frustrating, but it's still important to put in the effort to do so.

Also, there's a world of difference between saying ""I prefer stereotypically masculine men"" and ""no sissies plz, *real* men only!"" One of those is derogatory, the other is not. However, some treat them both the same, because calling some things ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" reinforces stereotypes and isn't the greatest thing in the world to do - but I still think there's a very important difference between innocently &amp; passively reinforcing a stereotype (of sorts) and actively degrading people. ^(And I'm not entirely convinced that using ""masculine"" in this way is a bad thing, either.) I think you may have gotten negative comments from some folks who don't recognize that difference because they're hyper-defensive. ^(They may have their reasons for being hyper-defensive, but that doesn't mean it's always the right choice either.)

Anyway. No, there's nothing wrong with your preferences, but you maybe could have expressed them better. Also, don't pay *too* much attention to random internet hatred."

Don't be fooled by big companies that say they are organic, though. Find a co-op or some other such store in your area. Some of these big companies just feed their chickens all organic corn, that's still not what you're looking for. You want a local farm whose website you can check out, maybe call them.

On my birthday, I hung out with one of my buddies. We share the same birthday and it was tradition for us to hang. She texted me she loved me and that she wanted things to work out. I was frustrated and ranted to my buddy about all my frustrations. He said it'd all work out in the end. Over the next few days, she stopped talking to me. Cut to 2 weeks later, I see him hugged up on her. I found out through my ex's sister that my ex had been texting him for a while and was trying to be 'more than friends' with him and he was doing the same. (My ex's sister had a huge crush on my buddy and that's why she let me know.) I was furious. I gave my 'fuck yous' to both of them and ignored them when they tried to talk to me. A few weeks later, they stopped ""talking"", but only because my buddy fucked my ex's sister.

Xellith,truegaming,1390873495.0,"Some people think Majora's Mask is the bees knees.  It has a timer (3 days yes?) which gives you a sense of urgency.  This draws you into the world just as much as a vast ocean does.  However, I personally do not enjoy timed games like this, and thus I gave Majora's mask a miss.  Now I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with a timed game, or that Majoras mask itself was a bad game.  It just wasn't for me.  But the fact it was a timed game gave you a sense of the gravity of the situation. The urgency.  This can be mirrored to the intent of the ocean of the wind waker.  I saw the vastness of the ocean, and I felt the gravity of what had been done... twas breathtaking.  Was it for everyone?  No.  But does it mean it was bad?  Definitely not.

Too many times people throw out labels such as ""the game sucked because of X"".  But I think to truly say whether a game is bad or not, one **must** address the question ""what was the artists intent, and how did they convey it?"".  With that said, people must be aware that a game can be good, but be something you dislike entirely.

jonfabe,techsupport,1390873661.0,"So I did some digging around on the internet, it seems it might be a bug with the controller in your SSD drive. Googling ""ocz vertex 2 boot failure"" revels many complaints similar to yours where the drive will fail to boot until power cycled a few times. Additionally, I found a review for your motherboard on newegg that also mentions your problem (from a Jordan J. posted on 21 Jan, 2014): 
&gt; Cons: This is not a Con for this board, it's a heads up to anyone using a SSD drive utilizing an older Sanforce controller. Beware, older Sanforce drives, OCZ Vertex 2 era, have an issue with the Haswell SATA chipset. The motherboard bios will not detect the drive. This is due to the older Sanforce controllers not following SATA specifications.


As for why it also had a problem with your older HDD it might have the same type of SATA controller as your SSD. Short of either using a different SSD or a different MOBO, I'm not sure theres much else that could be done.

Your friend's death was not your fault. I know you ""know"" this. And someday I hope you feel it. You deserve to be free of that burden that is not yours.

You're undermining your point here with this comparison, though it was tenuous logic anyway. Schrodinger's Cat was a thought experiment that had the sole purpose of showing how absolutely ridiculous the Copenhagen interpretation is.

Something that fits your ""superposition"" evidence would be the Buddhist idea of [Mu.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_\(negative\)#.22Unasking.22_the_question) I think your examples are closer to ""neither one nor the other"" instead of ""both are valid and correct until we observe it.""

&gt;Tyrion, in this state of being both the son of Tywin and the son of Aerys, can be said to have ""three heads""

This is ridiculous. There's no evidence for Aerys being his father (saying ""some people speculated"" isn't evidence, especially when you don't even cite so much as speculation) and it's an absurd leap ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^quantum ^^^^^^leap? to go from ""Aerys might be Tyrion's father because it hasn't been disproved"" to ""Tyrion has two fathers and therefore fulfills this three-head prophecy thing.""

&gt;perhaps the love affair between sad Queen Naerys and her perfect knight of a brother might foreshadow or hint at a similar relationship between sad Queen Rhaella and a perfect knight of her own?

You're extrapolating from almost nothing, then using that extrapolation to make *more* near-baseless assumptions.

&gt;The timeline isn't right for Daenerys to be Ashara's daughter, but what if Dany is Ashara's niece?

All Targaryens have purple eyes. It's, like, their thing.

&gt;So, when we put the pieces together

""Putting the pieces together"" means ""taking many wild guesses and assuming *every single one of them* is true.""

Sorry. 8/10 for effort, minus several thousand for good thinking."
Analog265,SquaredCircle,1390873740.0,"Definitely, especially since boxing is probably the worst for your brain.

With boxing, even if you're out they give you ten seconds to stagger back to your feet. If you're so hurt from being hit in the head that it takes you ten seconds to stand, you should not be fighting. MMA definitely *looks* more brutal but 2 or 3 bad shots and the ref steps in quickly."

Looking back, as an introvert who ""doesn't make friends so easily"" is look for someone I admire,  whose maturity or sagacity I can aspire to...and cultivate them.  Age, sex, circumstances- no matter.  Everyone enjoys being respected, and I've had it bloom for me more than once.  As you probably know,  introverts need no more than a couple of good friends, in order to accept a larger society with equanimity.  

I'd like to send this link to you- I have those feelings I described about the lady playing music in this video; i.e., I imagine she could be someone's very good friend.  I was amused by the theatrical musical direction she provides with her body and face, she has a sense of humour, discipline, honesty and grace, and the music is undeniably excellent.  Perhaps this is you, in essence?

Whoops, just realized you wrote ""Choir and *band*"" so I guess this is not your fate either.  Well,  nonetheless,  my point remains that you will find your happiness, and your associations in life,  as a direct reflection of your own qualities.  If you will possess yourself consciously of your own best attributes, and confidently invest emotionally in the things that please you most and that you admire, you will find those calm, confident choices leading you into a world of associations with others where age, condition, sex, wealth, and a host of other side issues are dismissed,  and your company (and your phone book) are much more filled with joyful opportunities.  

My mother was a piano teacher, and she used to say she would ""lie in wait""  like a jumping spider, for the right student to pass her door. And then delight in watching that person unfold.  I put it to you that you'll find yourself in that position with the people you will come to  love and admire.  I believe in you, in your coming changes.  It will be lovely. "

It's a fine album, but I honestly enjoyed Heist better. Say what you want about Macklemore, but most of his stuff speaks to/for/about today's society *more* than Yeezus does, social commentary-wise. Lorde's Royals does, Same Love does, etc. Yeezus, though? Not so much."

Since the track opened to go from VCP5-DT -&gt; VCP5-DCV, I decided to go this route and get my VCP5-DT first. I was scheduled to take a course via my local community college. They are a certified vITA, but their admission process hindered my being able to do so this semester. That being said, I'll likely pick up some material that covers the vSphere portion and that would also help me prepare for the VCP5-DCV when that time comes.

I will check out the link you've provided, and I definitely hope you don't mind that I've added you to my address book, just in case I run into anything. I did order your book, and will probably abuse it in preparation :)

My expectations for the course, after having already administered a View environment, were definitely not that the course would cover everything and allow me to sit the exam without any other prep work. It is reassuring, though, to hear you say that the material covered is greater than 20%, because I was genuinely concerned about the exam, or rather about my ability to sit it successfully."

You'd think that it would detract form the experience, but what happens is that many guys bond with the other guys who are going through the degrees at the same time. 

I've seen lodges hold joint degrees, and in some cases, I think it works well. If one lodge is a bit light on officers, or if they don't have enough guys to make a really nice showing at the MM, then combining lodges can be a good thing for both the lodges and the candidates. 

The candidates, remember them? They're the ones that we are supposed to be holding the degrees for, not the PMs. If the lodges can get together and have a nice dinner along with the degree, then that makes for a very welcoming experience for the candidates. 

As far as the solemnity goes, I've seen a few lodges that have come just shy of making a mockery of the ceremonies, all by themselves. "

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1390874722.0,"I think the whole 'friendzone' issue stems from the differences in how men and women approach friendships. For women, friendship means emotional intimacy. For men, friendship is less about sharing feelings and more about just doing things together. 

So when a man puts time and effort into developing emotional intimacy with a woman and that intimacy is reciprocated, he thinks that means she's interested, when really, that's just how women make friends. So the guy feels like he is was lead on or feels like he is owed a romantic relationship/sex because of the emotional energy he's invested in the relationship. If a woman gets rejected, there's not the same sense of wasted energy because for her, the way the relationship developed is the norm. She's more likely to put the blame on herself for not being up to par rather than on the man for wasting her time. "

strangestdude,PurplePillDebate,1390874759.0,"Regarding feminist theory, I'll requote something I wrote to someone;

(Before I quote it, something that grinds my gears is when feminists try to present feminist theory as objective/scientific analysis when it's social philosophy. Based on the anti-positivism approach to sociology).

From what I've observed from debating feminists...

1) The Patriarchy is the doctrine of male/masculine superiority.

And/or

2) The Patriarchy is a social system where males are the heads of social organizations.

And/or.

3) The Patriarchy is a social system where males are the heads of social organizations, and use their influence to benefit men as a demographic.

I've been listening to a lot of Warren Farrell, and IMO and IME he presents the most cogent argument against the notion of the patriarchy. (If the patriarchy is a combination of the above.)

I'll try to summarize;

Males and females were culturally assigned roles for the survival and proliferation of tribe, religion, or nation. The male role was to be the protector and provider, whilst women were expected to be baby makers, child carers, and home makers. (Hence why men had more social rights than women, because it was necessary for their role.) 

Like Farrell I agree that no single gender is responsible for the formation and conformity of these roles, and they probably proliferated due to a mixture of cultural and religious memes, and pragmaticism. (Pragmaticism in the sense that drafting men and women would; a) Lead to a prevalence of orphans, b) would jeopardize survival because the gender capable of giving birth would die, and the infant mortality rate was high, as was death during childbirth, before medical advances.) 

Gender-feminists on the other hand believe that the roles were assigned due the doctrine of male/masculine superiority.

Also if we use Warren Farrell's primary definition of power as; control over one's own, to live in accordance with one's own values - then no gender has had power historically. And considering one gender role as more privileged than the other is comparing apples and oranges. Because whilst men had greater social rights than women, men were also considered disposable for the protection and proliferation of the tribe, nation, society, etc. (Hence the legal and cultural drafting of men to become military combatants, and the notion of ""Women and children first."")

The above provides a very different framework to analyze gender issues than gender-feminists typically use, for example;

Many gender-feminists analyze the cultural disapproval of boys and males expressing vulnerability as a by-product of the notion of female inferiority. They posit that women are deemed inferior or disliked, and so traits deemed feminine are discouraged for a man to express due to misogyny.

Whereas Warren Farrell's paradigm interprets the cultural disapproval of boys and male's expressing vulnerability as a by-product of gender roles. Males expressing vulnerability is discouraged, because gender conformity is encouraged - which has nothing to do with the notion of female inferiority. Hence why women have also been discouraged traditionally from displaying traits that don't conform to their gender roles.

I've read from a few masculists that Warren Farrell's paradigm actually comes from 2nd wave feminism (which he was an integral part of) before the patriarchy and male privilege became the dominant paradigm for analyzing social issues.

People who actually know what's going on in the Texas Governors race have no reason to fear her campaign, even though we do respect her for her ability to fundraise and draw media attention. However, her campaign has an abysmal communications staff, they handled this ""scandal"" poorly, causing it to be exacerbated beyond what it should have been: a minor correction to an official bio. I will concede that a small number of loud people seized the opportunity to hate her for any reason available, but the political operatives who have payed attention to this race will tell you that Greg Abbott is going to coast to an easy victory because he has run a tight, safe campaign in a race that has always leaned his way. The Davis campaign has not used resources well, and the consultant firm they hired for their TV and direct mail is not the best available--and they spent way too much in markets that are not likely to swing their way no matter how much money they throw at them. AND THE GENERAL ELECTION RACE HASNT EVEN STARTED YET.

He can stop time and bend wills and etc. I'm sure you all know how powerful the Dragon Born is considering Skyrim is so well known. The chosen undead doesn't have perks or any kind of special abilities. All the magic and sorcery in dark souls is also limited, while Skyrim shouts are unlimited. The chosen undead has the ability to be invincible whenever he/she dodges though. And the magic in Dark Souls does a lot more damage, IMO. The chosen undead also has more skill in fighting. Plus, the chosen undead always fights against overwhelming odds and creatures that well surpass him in strength and numbers. Which Skyrim does not have. So I would say that the Dragon Born dies at fighting the 4 kings, Nito, The bed of chaos or Manus. Seath really wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for the scripted death when you first meet him. But if Nito is not limited by game mechanics then he can just unleash death on the dragon born. The 4 kings live in the abyss, Manus could use the abyss to corrupt the dragon born, and the bed of chaos could unleash firestorms and demons. The dragon born ends there. The chosen undead is eventually overwhelmed by the dragons he kills because he can't absorb their souls."

There is nothing here about your obvious athletic pursuits, there's nothing here about what you do for a living.   There is nothing here about future asperations job or personal.

AgentDL,AskMen,1390875055.0,"Dude, I think you're going about this the wrong way. I understand where you're coming from because I've been in your position fairly recently. I am a one-woman kind of guy, even when I'm dating. If I meet someone I'm interested in, I feel that they deserve the courtesy of my exclusive attention for a couple weeks to see what develops, or what doesn't. On the same note, I feel like I deserve the same. Just for a short period of time. It doesn't need to drag on for months, but let's give it at least three or four dates over a couple weeks to see what happens, without letting other potential connections get in the way. I think that's reasonable, and *I want to date someone who also thinks it's reasonable.* 

It seems like you're doing the non-exclusive thing with this girl not because *you* want to, but because *she* wants to. If you don't want to, don't do it. Find another girl that's willing to give you a couple weeks to see what's up instead of someone who needs to ""have her options open."" That's bullshit. What's the rush? Dating and relationships are a game of months and ultimately years. What's so fucking urgent that you can't see one person at a time and give them a thumbs up or a thumbs down before moving onto the next? I don't get it. 

Funny side story: One time last year I happened to meet two great girls during the same weekend. During the week I had set up a Sunday date with someone from an online dating site. That Saturday, before I got a chance to meet Sunday-girl, I happened to hit it off really nicely with a friend of a friend at a barbecue. I ""dated"" both of these girls for *five days* before deciding to pick one and go with it. I hated seeing both of them at the same time. I couldn't remember who I told what, which is crucial during those first few dates when you're sharing so much personal information about yourself... And I didn't feel good about trying to  establish emotional and physical connections with two people. Lasted until the following Thursday before I picked one. "

He and I had been together on and off for 9 years. Apparently during one of our ""off"" periods, he changed his mind about marriage and kids...he no longer wanted either. I'd spent over a year talking about marrying him and having kids and he never contradicted me. I still don't know what he was thinking, but to me it seemed like he was being incredibly selfish because he was happy and comfortable in our relationship.

I ended it. Not wanting kids is a hard limit for me. Compounded with the fact that he had basically lied to me for over a year, and I had to force the answer out of him, it was clearly time to end things.

So it's definitely different from your story, but I'm a little wary that he ""assumed"" you knew he didn't want kids. Were I you, that would add to my hesitation about continuing the relationship."

md619,AskMen,1390875200.0,"Here's the thing about openers. They're absolutely crucial because like it or not, everyone judges, generalizes and compartmentalizes you in about the few first seconds of meeting them. If you make an initial poor impression you'll be fighting an uphill battle all night. Girls like to feel that instant connection.

But, guys tend to worry about the wrong things. Guys worry about *what should I say* when they should be worried more about *how did I say it*. Just saying ""Hey"" is sometimes all you need to say to break the ice. Truthfully I almost never know what I'm going to say to a girl in till it's out of my mouth. Sometimes I even surprise myself.

Worry instead about body language. Worry about holding eye contact. Worry about speaking with a confident tone. How quick were you to open when you saw her? Did you open right away or did you stare at her like a weirdo for 10 minutes trying to get the courage up? I could go on and on.

These things just take practice. You have to be willing to go out, make a fool of yourself and come back. You have to be willing to forgive yourself if you freeze up and fail to open. Just keep coming back to it.

Make the bar your home. Get to know the people who work there like good friends. Get a reputation. Bring your friends with you and introduce them to people. When you're in a comfortable situation your confidence level will be 100x higher and you're WAY more likely to do everything right. So make the bar a comfortable place to be. 

Have fun. When you and your friends are your own party *girls will open you*. People want to be with the people who are having fun, but most people don't know how to cut lose. Give off positive emotions and watch it transfer to other people like magic.

redesckey,NoPoo,1390875296.0,"Obviously everyone is different, but I personally think it makes a lot of sense to start with water-only.  I think of it as detox for your hair.  Let it adjust and wait for it to stabilize, then add to the routine from there.

Anyway to share my experience.. I started water-only in early October.  I used cornstarch at first to help with the extra grease, but haven't needed it for a couple of months now.  If it helps, I applied it in the evening, and washed it out the next morning.

Currently, I use only water and a boar bristle brush.  Here's my routine:

- brush really well before I shower
- at the beginning of my shower I get my hair wet (it takes longer to absorb water than it used to)
- at the end of my shower, I wash it/scrub my scalp (note that I spend more time on this than I did when I used shampoo)
- after washing (while still in the shower) I detangle with a comb
- I also clean my brush almost daily

Regarding grossness:

- for the first 6-8 weeks it looked okay with cornstarch (used daily at the beginning, weekly at the end) and always felt gross.
- it shifted at about 6-8 weeks and was suddenly noticeably ""not gross"", however there were still good days and bad days
- now it's been nearly 4 months, and it's mostly stabilized, and looks and feels great."

So she left the catholic church and went to another protestant church with her friends. And this went on for almost two years before the dad found out, (Since he didn't go with, and thus didn't know.) hit the roof, and insisted that that was a betrayal of her Irish heritage, and insisted she go back to the catholic church with him. He only started going again to be a ""Good Irish person."" She eventually started going with them, and that's what began them and their kids taking it uber seriously. A self regulating insistence on being the best Irish people they could be.

Firstly I think it should be addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, meaning not more than 3 months later. The main issue though is getting the people that receive the listserv to not disregard it or think of it as some sort of joke. Does that mean maybe having a panel of students/staff/SSMU members discuss and come to a verdict about whether or not the action is deemed worthy of a public apology? Maybe this could help weed out things that are perceived by the grand majority as trivial, such as I believe this instance is.

strangestdude,PurplePillDebate,1390875564.0,"That's one way of interpreting the education gap. I think there is a hostile environment from boys (eg. the 5 year study showing data that women teachers mark boys lower than external examiners, and women make up the majority of teachers).  

Research show the gap is getting bigger, and I hope that society tries to tackle the issue before it get's worse. But I think that is going to take a massive cultural shift where people begin to care about men's issues as deeply as they do women's issues.

Or it will take lamenting from women who can't find men that they can have LTR's with. Ie. IMO many women want to have a LTR with someone who has the same level of formal education as them and has a similar level of income, and with men doing worse than women it will effect the size of their dating pool.

Looks like we'll have to agree to disagree on our analysis of the gender gap. I believe the education gap is a gender issue, and you don't. "

m00nh34d,australia,1390875668.0,"I thought this was just general knowledge? I was under the impression that everyone knew/thought that the CFMEU was the bikie union.

There are some unions out there still working for their members, ANU for example have been working hard for pay rises for nurses in Victoria over the last couple of years. But when you look at some of the building unions, you really need to think about if this is really the right model for collective bargaining and lobbyist representation. 

The government in power right now wouldn't have any issues with tearing down these unions. When looking at examples like the article here, you don't really feel any loss. 

I fear that it will result in a reduction to some of the actual good they do. Who will be there to stand up against ""Workchoices v2"" if we tear down all unions in response to this?

Perhaps a good start would be changing the laws to actually protect the **people** more. In the past it's always been a tug-o-war between protecting the businesses and the unions (or at least their membership numbers). Just let people chose if they want to be part of a union, make it so that **anyone** who attempts to interfere with this decision can be held to account. For a start at least."

 Then you could decide together, as adults, to stay or leave together.

I'm thinking maybe the other guy isn't away she is dating other people.... Or being just out of a long term relationship (and probably not used to dating multiples at the same time) she freaked out and didn't know what to do.

If you like her, still continue on, but talk about this situation first. Communication is your friend. If she tries to avoid it or whatever, then maybe it is more then nerves, but nerves and immaturity could still be the issue more than her being ""involved"" moreso with someone else.

Well one day it went missing, we looked for it everywhere, but my sister couldn't remember when she'd last had it. She was pretty torn up about it for quite awhile. 
Ten years go by and we go to a restaurant that we don't frequent about 45 minutes from our house. We're sitting at the table eating when all of the sudden my sister looks shocked. We ask her whats wrong and she points at the supporting beams over the cash register, which are laden with different decorations, one of which is an old stuffed dog with a red collar and brown fur. We ask our waitress where the dog came from and she tells us to wait for a minute and brings out the restaurant's manager who says the dog came from a little girl ~ten years ago and that when she was young, she had lost her own stuffed toy so she had insisted on keeping the dog around. It had become sort of a mascot for the restaurant since. When we looked at the dog sure enough, it was the same one, with my sister's initial written right on the tag, just as she had written them ten years before when she was learning. "

Describing his life as a child/teenager growing up in the non-child-friendly city of Compton, every song is full of both great lyricism and meaning. Macklemore's The Heist was a huge album last year. Thrift Shop, Can't Hold Us, and Same Love were giant smash-hit singles. Being radio-friendly and (though this point might be controversial) white, the people who decided the winners were more inclined to vote for Macklemore as opposed to a young black rapper who produced music that was a bit dark. Hip-Hop fans were devastated when Macklemore won a grammy in all the categories Kendrick was in. People are blaming Macklemore for this, even though the aging and supposedly quality-blind grammy voters should be the ones people should be angry with. Macklemore even tweeted a picture of a text he sent to Kendrick after the awards saying how he shouldn't have won the award, and that Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City was the better album. All in all, there shouldn't be verbal assault, but the person it is being directed towards is not the one in the wrong. The Grammys have long been known to be nothing but a popularity contest with a few good performances between."

MaximilianKohler,AskReddit,1390876057.0,"&gt; You honestly think it's society's fault when someone commits violent crime? How so?

Because we failed to provide the right circumstances for this person to grow into a well functioning adult.

People are capable of all kinds of things depending on their circumstances. To think that the people in countries like Germany, Japan, and Russia who committed heinous crimes against humanity were intrinsically different than they are now is wrong. It was the conditions at the time which lead to the behavior.

It it society's fault for enabling the behavior by allowing/providing the conditions necessary.

There was a really good comment in a thread recently describing the conditions in India which lead to the high rape occurrence.

&gt;Rather than kill someone that you don't think deserves to live

Well that was part of OP's reasoning, but it's more than that. Like I mentioned previously, it benefits no one to bring a disabled person into existence. 

&gt;why not focus the energy on finding the genetic traits responsible and fixing it before it even happens?

I agree with this. That would be ideal. But I don't think abortion is taking up unnecessary energy. I think it's the best option we currently have (beyond contraception - which is another thing anti-abortion people tend to oppose...).

P.S. I quite enjoyed your reply. I can't remember ever talking to a conservative who didn't immediately come across as an uninformed, bigoted imbecile. But your comment seemed pretty reasonable and level-headed."

Favorites.. nice job breaking them up and adding white space for clarity.  Books.. find time to read some.  Didn't you read any for school that you actually enjoyed enough to remember or pick up your own copy of?  Movies.. do you have any favorite movies that are date friendly?  Any Romantic Comedies at all?  Music and tv pretty solid.

Six things.. solid.

Thinking about.. not bad since you're new to the area.

Friday.. not bad, though you do you hang out online while you're watching?

Message me.. not bad, but might need tuning since it's pretty generic, but I'll leave that to someone more creative.

hambeastly,TwoXChromosomes,1390876238.0,"Since you don't know what will work best for you yet, I would answer the doctor's questions honestly, mention that you want a low-dose pill, and ask which among the best options for you are most affordable. 

When it comes to starting the pill: You can do it whenever, but if you start mid-cycle you should use backup protection for the rest of your cycle in case you have already ovulated (the pill works by preventing ovulation). As has been mentioned, if you have multiple partners or don't know with complete confidence the sexual history of any partner you have, use a condom because STIs can  be uncomfortable and awkward at best, and devastating and permanent at worst. 

On top of that, your body may take time to adjust to the new pill and you could have side effects related to spotting, breast tenderness, nausea, mood swings or irregularity... Some side effects are more likely to occur if you start mid-cycle as opposed to the first day of your period or, if you want, the first Sunday after it starts. 

I would recommend that based on personal experience because if I do not take it at exactly the same time and start on the end of my cycle, I get spotting all month. A lot of women don't have that problem and a lot of women can even skip or shorten periods by starting the new pack instead of the placebo pills, but since you don't know how your body will respond yet, you might want to save the experimenting for later to give it the best shot at adjusting."

sorator,askgaybros,1390876371.0,"It sounds like some people have treated you like shit, and I'm sorry for that. It also sounds like you're in a pretty shitty mindset right now, and I can offer some advice about that.

Find things you *do* like about yourself, and focus on those for a while, and/or change some simple things that you've always disliked but never put effort into changing. Nothing huge, just some minor stuff - maybe you don't brush your teeth as often as you feel like you should, or you wish you actually matched your socks when you did laundry instead of chucking them in a drawer. Pick some easy wins, and otherwise, focus on what you *do* like. Because right now, you're 1. letting others choose your focus *for* you, which is never a good idea, and 2. focusing on stuff that you don't like about yourself that is difficult to change.

If you find yourself thinking something negative, like if you look in the mirror and think ""My nose is so dumb. Why is my nose so dumb?"" ^(I'm being purposefully satirical) and then that turns into ""Why do I not like my nose? Why am I focusing on this? This sucks!"" - that's when you make yourself think of something positive instead. It *helps* if that's something about *you* that is positive, or that you like, but it doesn't have to be about you - it could easily be ""I'm going to stop thinking about my nose because that bird outside my window is tweeting very prettily right now."" And of course if you've racked up a few easy wins by changing little things about yourself, you can use those to - ""I'm going to stop thinking about my nose because I folded my socks last night and that was good!"" or even ""...because I need to go fold my socks right now instead of thinking about my nose!""

Just whenever you think something pointlessly negative, make a conscious decision to think about something else instead. That keeps you from worrying yourself in a circle, and it trains your mind to focus on positive things instead of negative ones, and both of those are good things to do. It may seem like a futile effort at first, but I promise that it works.

Also, take a break from dating sites and posting pics online and such. Stuff like that requires a pretty firm mental foundation, and while you may have had that at one point, you definitely don't now. Once you're able to wade through the negative comments searching for that nugget of gold, and filter the negative stuff out so that it doesn't affect you as much as it has been, *then* you can come back to those activities. But you probably need a break for now, especially since it sounds like you deal with enough of that at work already.

By changing from negative to positive thought, even though it's a purely internal thing, you'll become muuuuch more likable by those around you. I'm not saying you'll have people dropping roses at your feet to plead that you accompany them this evening, but you *will* get along easier with others, and maybe get a party invite or two. Also, if there are bigger changes that you want to make (changes in wardrobe, lose weight, stop smoking, be more social, whatever), then you will be better able to make those changes after already working on smaller things (practice!) and changing your mindset (less discouragement). You'll also be able to get back into the dating scene without letting people bash you up so much, because you've developed some insulation.

I'm a very mild looking person myself - the only thing that really stands out is my hair color. So, when I was feeling overly down about myself, my appearances, my mental state (long battle with clinical depression and anxiety and panic attacks), I started to reframe my thoughts as I described above. I'm definitely not where I want to be yet, but I'm so much farther than I was before I made some conscious, intentional decisions to change my state. I've had people remark on how much I've changed over the past few years, which is neat, and I've also found that people *really* want to spend time with me but can't give much of a reason why other than ""you're an awesome guy,"" and I think a big part of that is that I actively avoid having a negative attitude.

One of those decisions was a very tangible one. I didn't really like my appearance - too bland, not ulgy, not attractive, not memorable, with the exception of my red/auburn hair. So, I focused on that one thing that I liked and stood out, and grew a pretty rockin' ponytail. I've been growing it out for the past... four years? I think? and it's now longer than many of my female friends, and I get to see the beautiful combination of colors much more often. It's a visual reminder of how much control I do have over my life when I choose to exercise it, it's a nice distraction if I'm worrying myself in circles (visually and tangibly!), it's something that I've had guys be especially attracted to (though nothing serious has come of it, it's still been nice to get that kind of attention now and then), it helps me stand out in a crowd if I want to, it throws other people off a bit when I meet them which is how I like it... and that's all from a fairly simple change. (I'm not saying everyone should grow a ponytail to feel better about themselves; it's just an example.)

Change for the better the way you think about life, and you'll find the people around you changing for the better as well - it sounds like that's what you need right now. (And in terms of dating, if that's getting you down at all, this will also get you much more fulfilling success than, say, trying to make yourself look or act like someone else.)"

pilotmkn,Shitstatistssay,1390876374.0,"Interesting you mention that.

I've told my own story in the past on here, but I started out as a commercial aviation major working towards a degree (which I later found out is fairly useless vs just having time in an airplane) and paying for very expensive and intentionally prolonged flight training at a state university. The market crashed and I noticed that recent graduates were having an extremely difficult time finding work as pilots and things weren't looking bright.

I made a life-changing decision and dropped out immediately, moved home with my parents and enrolled in the school of accounting at the university in my hometown and starting working and paying out of pocket (for the majority of the cost, my parents helped with the rest) of my tuition. I picked accounting because A) I had enjoyed it in high school and the basic classes I had to take for my aviation major, B) Its a growing and in-demand field....the government is always going to increase taxes and red tape and C) I wanted to help people avoid the tentacles of the IRS and keep more of their own money.

So yes, I do have a huge burden of student debt from the state college flight school around my neck. I don't bitch about it. I plan to pay it off on my own. I was stupid to ever embark on that path. I didn't do enough due diligence or research. I could have gone to a private flight school at a local airport and done that same 4 years worth of training in 1-2 years for a LOT less money and then earned money in the remaining 2 years building hours as a flight instructor, albeit without a worthless ""commercial aviation"" degree to hang on my wall.

I haven't even graduated yet and I already have a full time position as an auditor in the medical field, helping hospitals recoup money they are owed by insurance companies. Thanks to Obamacare, our business is excpected to quadruple in the next few years. I feel like I made the right decision strategically speaking.

Ch4rm,relationship_advice,1390876413.0,"You are generalizing your gender with some of those statements. I'm not really sure any idea could be considered all encompassing for either gender, and I'm still not convinced traits are gender specific. There are women who do these things. There are men who do these things. There are men and women who have boundaries against doing these things. 

&gt; you'll realize how naive you are
&gt; I honestly feel badly for you

I want to ask that you not make personal attacks, please. They get in the way of actual discussion. They also do not add credence to your argument, whether you are right or not.

&gt;I'm sorry to be blunt but too many women walk around with notions that humans are above their primal instincts, just because a man chooses to suppress and downplay his natural instincts doesn't make them go away

Again, these are massive generalizations. 

&gt; women are wired to produce offspring and protect them while men are wired to produce as many offspring as possible

I have never wanted children nor experienced feelings of protection for other children (barring siblings). I don't think reducing human nature to this level is in any way a true idea regarding who we are, how we act, and what we think. We are far removed from needing ""primal instincts"" to survive. I think the fact that asexual people exist is evidence of that. People who have no drive to reproduce and only seek companionship. (This group includes men and women.)

&gt; ""alpha male"", I bet you have - conversely there's no such thing as an ""alpha female"" because nature doesn't work like that.

I don't agree with ""alpha"" concepts, I think they're silly. These terms are generally taken from the way wolves behave, but the truth is that they don't have classes based on alpha/beta. Neither do humans.

&gt; Why do you think men masturbate to porn and not pictures of their girlfriends?

I looove posting on gonewild. It makes my boyfriend uncomfortable. My boy likes porn. That makes me uncomfortable. As a compromise, I made a subreddit just for him where I post pictures of myself. We're both very happy with the setup. He loves seeing me naked more than other women. I feel as if this may be more true than you think. If you don't like seeing your girlfriend naked, or prefer other women, why are you with her? I feel like that would make both sides unhappy."

Unless there is an unusual hymen situation, and those are not terribly common, we're talking ""minor incident with office supplies"" pain, not ""bicycle accident"" pain.

Also, I read somewhere else but this method of voting is actually really strong. Instead of the voting on lolesports, people are voting with 'money' instead.  (IP is like money as its hard earned).  This might give a better indication as to community consensus on a winner (less troll picks).

And its not a straight win or lose thing.  It's based on the percentage chance they have of winning.  In an efficient market this would stabilize to give a better indication of percentage chance of winning, unlike lolesports which is binary choice.  So if someone had 90% chance of winning, you might bet on the 10%.  you might be able to 10x your money (minus fees).

Still apart from this, I think this would be very fun and it would also let people have a chance to make more ip."

And here you are complaining about some shit he said like 4 seasons ago. And judging by the complaints I've heard from other fans in r/pats its totally exaggerated and definitely not worth remembering for the next 4 years. I just don't get it. 

As for me, there hasn't been a single fucking time where I've felt the need to bitch about biased commenting (not that I've really noticed anything to really get angry at). Who cares? Personally I enjoy the great majority of NFL commenters and like their insight into the game, formations, rulings on the field etc. It just adds to the experience for me. 

If you hate it so much why don't you just mute the game? Seriously dude, 4 years and still complaining.

wufoo2,sex,1390876771.0,"It's the subtle touches that work for me. We have 50 percent more nerve endings than a cut guy (they're in the foreskin) and a smooth, supple glans that gives a much wider range of sensations.

What this means for you is improved ROI: Less labor for you, more enjoyment for him.

The foreskin's nerve endings specialize in stretch-and-release, like the nerve endings in your lips. You know how good it feels when you're kissing and your guy manipulates your lips with his lips and tongue? It's the same when your lips and tongue work on his foreskin.

Rolling the skin with your hand stimulates those nerve endings, too, peeling the glans then rolling it closed again. Bonus: When it's closed, slide your tongue in between the foreskin and glans. Swirl. You may have to pause occasionally for him to stop shaking. ;-)

The glans likes gentle, wet friction. (It can be touched dry, but only completely dry. Even a little moisture will make your fingers feel like erasers.)

Also, he'll have a frenulum, whereas most circumcised guys don't. That's the raised strip connecting the underside of his glans to his foreskin. It's very, very sensitive to direct stimulation. (I think it's key to triggering orgasm during sex.) Don't go right to it, though. Save it for the finish.

rick2g,Physics,1390876814.0,"&gt; but even if it scales linearly it offers the promise of orders of magnitude more computational power than a similarly sized traditional computer once refined

Ok... maybe we're talking across each other, but ""orders of magnitude"" are actually not significant here.  Even if D-Wave's system is 1000x faster than an Intel CPU, then it's *still* just a linear improvement... and that's *completely* beside the point.

Quantum computation exists in a completely different world from classical Turing or Von Neumann computation... it's not about being 1000 or even 1000000x faster than a CPU... it's about being able to scale alongside an algorithmic problem as input scales...

If an NP complete problem has 2 inputs, then it has 2 potential solutions.  If it has 4 inputs, then it has 16 different possible solutions (ie, 2^4 ).  It scales *exponentially*.  It's 2^n, not 2*n.  Quantum computation, at least theoretically, allows us to posit that problems which can only be solved via brute-force methods with modern CPUs might be solved relatively quickly via quantum entanglement - ie, a problem with 2^n inputs might be solvable with n qubits...

An NP problem with, say, 64 possible binary inputs is *not* currently solvable via classical means in a reasonable time frame (ie, less than the expected life of the universe).  A true quantum computer could solve such a problem with 64 qubits in a relatively short time (theoretically, such a computation would be near-instantaneous).  But that's only possible with full entanglement... and what D-Wave is doing is *not* entanglement.  It doesn't matter how many ""superconducting circuits"" they slap together... it does *not* constitute a form of computation which can scale faster than regular classical transistors."

I really hope you do your homework on this one. Houses this size are generally glorified sheds in the eyes of many jurisdictions. Zoning codes generally require the house to be permanent, meet minimum dwelling size, etc. This wouldn't even meet many mobile home dwelling minimums. I really could only see you living in an RV park, if you don't mind that, or out in the middle of nowhere. 

Caveat Emptor, for real. I do zoning for a living."

steve496,NFL_Draft,1390876847.0,"From a purely numerical perspective, it more or less works: 49ers give up 30+61, which is 912 points.  Pick 19 is 875, so from a theoretical perspective the Dolphins would be 37 short.  Dolphins 5th is 15th in the round, which is currently pick 143 but will likely be closer to pick 150 after compensatory picks are added, which puts its value around 31-32 points.  Little short, but in the ballpark.

That said, I personally am not a fan for two reasons.

First, I don't think the 49ers need more late-round picks.  We have some clear uses for early-round picks, but we already have a lot of late-round picks and most of them aren't going to make the roster as it is.  The pattern from the last few years is that we trade up with this year's picks and trade down for next year's picks.  Hence, I think in the abstract we'd probably prefer to do something like 30 + 56 for 19 + next year's 3rd.

And second: this is an unusually deep class, which will likely reduce the cost of trading up.  That is: the decline in prospect quality from trading down is smaller than usual, and the quality of the prospect you get from an extra pick is higher than usual, so (at least some) teams will be willing to accept a lesser prospect than usual to trade down.  So I think the 49ers will hold out for a better deal than merely even on the trade chart, because someone will be wiling to pay it.

Hence, I would guess that the 49ers aren't going to offer a 2nd to trade up to 19. Our offers in that range are going to be based more on pick 77 than on pick 61 - and even there, I'm not sure we won't be able to get more than pick 19 with 30+77."

The first is short and kind of vague while the second is much more indepth.

The main differences though are cost. Plasmas are cheapest and offer very good picture but are major power hogs. LCD's are usually moderately priced and offer good picture and moderate power usage. LED's are the most expensive and usually offer very good picture for the lowest power consumption.

Personally, I'd say go for a Plasma if you are getting a very large TV (60"" or more) or an LCD for anything less than that. The reason is primarily cost based. 

However, if cost is no option then go ahead and splurge on an LED. I believe they have the longest theoretical life and have excellent picture quality."

Are you already accepted to a university, of so where?  That could influence the ""he's going to be xx miles away in 8 months.. "" sort of thinking.

What you're good at.. Pretty good, but the lead in makes it sound like fixing computers and weight training are wasting time.. those are both pretty good things to be good at, so lose the negativity.  You like to exercise your mind and your body, that is good, don't presume a reader will jump to the conclusion you're a meat head when your pictures show off that you're fit without going overboard.

First thing.. solid.

Favorites.. good job with breaking things up and adding white space for readability.

Music.. good.

Food.. were you ever a fat kid?  Otherwise the mention could be taken as a knock against fat people.. Maybe change it up to something like you exercise to be able to eat well because you like food?   Any cuisines you really like or really don't?  This is only one of two categories there isnt' a type of &lt;whatever&gt; that you mention you like.

TV and movies.. solid

Books.. find one that someone recommended to you and you thought was a good read, add that in ""The last recommendation I enjoyed was.. "" whatever it was and be able to remember enough about the book to talk about it.  This is the second category that does not have something you like.   If you haven't gotten any good recommendations in a while go pick up Winter's Tale by Mark Helprin and read all 600 + pages before the movie comes out in the middle of next month.

Six things.. solid, and reddit gets included..excellent.

Thinking about.. pretty solid.

Typical Friday.. this is the first mention of you having a current job.. maybe mention it in the about me section as well, what do you do, do you like it.. etc.  Otherwise pretty solid.

Private.. fair to pretty solid.  Are you living at home?  Can you get cooking lessons?

Message me if.. 

a smart Woman, singular, not women plural..  otherwise pretty snappy.

rainbowsurfingkitten,Wicca,1390877218.0,"Non-wiccan witch here, but I'll write anyway. 

I don't think that Wicca as a ""nature-based religion"" necessarily leads to environmentalist beliefs. To begin with, very few wiccans are involved with agriculture, and in the technically advanced world that we live in, in which our survival no longer depends on the cycle of the seasons locally, it is irrelevant to most of the lives of wiccans. 

There's also the fact that the prosperity of animals and plants--which is what people usally mean primarily when they say ""nature""--is dependent on the destruction of other lifeforms. On Earth, creation necessitates destruction. Why shouldn't humans, which are just doing most successfully what other animals are doing, not destroy in order to create? There is something to be said for balance, of course, but if we can take down a forest to build a skyscraper, what part of that is out of harmony with the ways of nature?

 Nature-based metaphors about apex predators, such as the lion hunting down its prey to feed its cub, or a focus on the spring rebirth after the death of winter could be used to sanctify this. You could interpret the duality of Wicca as a license to use what you need from the Earth to create, even if that is harmful to other beings.

I don't actually believe that we should be bowling over rainforests to build cities or that we shouldn't factor in other species' welfare when doing things, this is all hypothetical."

fnredditacct,relationships,1390877224.0,"What you describe here is not being too controlling.

If you tried to dictate many of his friendships, or even those with non-romantic interests, that would be controlling.

This ""not doing what you tell him to do"" thing is a very real issue. It is something he needs to work on, for his own sake. Otherwise, anytime he does or says anything that makes someone feel uncomfortable or hurts their feelings, he'll feel pressured to keep up with his behavior just so he doesn't feel controlled. That will not make for a strong relationship for him.

My husband had a similar ""being controlled"" issue (although the triggers had nothing to do with ex lovers). For me, the rest of the relationship was solid enough, I believed we could work through it. And to a large extent we have.  I understand that the way I say and approach topics can really affect how he hears them and feels about them. But mostly, he's done a lot of work on his own in this department. He understands that I am not the controlling people of his past, I do not desire control over him. If I am expressing concern about something, it is because I have to, not because I'm looking for an edge.

I would not have been able to be patient while he worked on it if I didn't see how willing he was to do it, and how hard he tried.

If you are not getting a lot of support and love from your boyfriend, and he has this issue, it would be a good idea to look at what you get out of this relationship.

If you get a lot of support and love from him, AND he's willing to see that you aren't trying to control him, that you NEED to be able to tell him when he's done something that upsets you, then this can be worked on.

If he isn't willing to hear when he's done something wrong, there isn't much you can do. No one is perfect, and people who won't admit their mistakes exist and can harm others make for very bad partners."

If she can't stand up for yourself and the relationship, if she doesn't *want* to stand up for yourself and the relationship, then how are you suppose to trust her in the future?

Even if she did agree to cut him out after the ultimatum I would still question being with her. Doing you really want to be with someone who needs an ultimatum to make an obvious decision like this?

hambeastly,TwoXChromosomes,1390877346.0,"In my case, the guy was at my school for a couple of years. After the incident he tried contacting me, sent intensely personal ""give me another chance"" emails and left long, rambly, drugged-up messages on my phone. I sent him a text that said something like, ""You know what you did was fucked up. I don't want to hear from you again."" I blocked his e-mail address and he never contacted me by phone.

I only saw him once when I was on the bus and he was walking on the sidewalk, and I had a bit of a panic attack, but I didn't have to deal with him so it was okay.

I'd just block him now, though. You don't need to have the last word and he might not take it as ideally. He might be one of those people who latches on to any response. If you see him, ignore him. If he tries to talk to you, walk away. Just be as fucking cold to him as you feel. He doesn't deserve to be acknowledged by you. I always told myself that regardless of any good he does in life, any justification he can produce for his unjustifiable actions... he is always a sociopathic fuck-up in my book. 

But what I would do isn't what you SHOULD do, necessarily. I can't tell you what you should do. Whatever you decide to do, though, it's better than what he's done and I hope it helps. I'm sorry you had to go through this mess and I hope you are able to get through it however works best. Remember that if you are struggling it's okay to ask for help and support, even if you didn't report it and even if you don't have evidence.

delanthaenas,funny,1390877413.0,"You're kidding me, right?  Drinking + Sex doesn't always mean rape.  But how can you honestly not see that *waiting for someone to get drunk so you can have sex with them* is predatory, rapey, and all around douchey?

Let's say you're at a party, and a girl you don't want to have sex with propositions you.  You turn her down.  Then you drink more, and later, when she corners you in a back room, you're too drunk to say no as she throws you down and has her way with you.  She knew you didn't want it, and even if she didn't, she knew you were in no state to say no.  That makes her actions **wrong**.  It doesn't make you wrong for being drunk, it makes her wrong for taking advantage of your drunkenness to make you do something you never would sober.

And it's easy to say ""Oh, just don't get that drunk then"" or ""Don't drink at all.""  But really, what you're saying to people is ""Don't enjoy yourself, because somewhat might rape you, and then it's your fault for wanting to live a normal life.""  

I'm not saying I like to drink, or that I would enjoy getting trashed.  But I should be able to live in a world where I can get trashed if I goddamn well please and not have to worry about some predatory fuckwit deciding that means he's allowed to stick his dick in me."

mkvgtired,AdviceAnimals,1390877479.0,"Sorry you're dealing with tools. I love Chicago and the small-big city feel it has. I dont plan on moving anytime soon, but I definitely appreciate nature. One of my favorite things to do is going on one week (or longer) hikes (typically by myself). So as a city guy, I dont think any of that stuff sounds unreasonable. 

1) I love venison, and have tried moose. I will try pretty much anything you put in front of me including insects. I have had silkworm, roach, beetle, and spider (not sure of the species) (I wont try dog/house pets, which is available in some countries). 

2) My brother moved downstate and lives in the middle of nowhere. He has a construction company with my dad, and needs to get on unpaved lots for work often. So I understand the utility behind it, even if its not my thing if I have a choice.

3) In IL we only recently got the right to concealed carry. I got a Florida permit years ago after a hike in Virginia. A bear was trying to get my food that was hung in a tree. It climbed the tree, but the branch it was on broke. It fell only feet from my tent. I was about 2 days hike (or 3 cant remember) outside of a town, and the closest hospital was probably roughly another 30 minutes from that town. After that I decided I would carry a gun on me where allowed when hiking. When you're out there by yourself you cant only rely on a little knife. I will also probably get a PLB before the next major hike. 

4) I could see how that could be a culture shock. There's red-light cams in many states. I typically look both ways before going through a green anyway, especially when there's snow on the ground. 

Too bad you're dealing with these people. There are plenty of people down here that do appreciate stuff like that. I guess they're just not moving to Alaska. "

ixAp0c,NewSkaters,1390877622.0,"Try not to limit yourself to 1 hour sessions, for several reasons:

-When you are first starting out an hour might be too long of a session, you might be sore after 20-30 minutes of pushing and carving around for the first time.  Just go at it until you're tired.

-When you start skating on a daily basis you won't be as tired out after an hour since you will be more used to it

I personally skate until I'm too sore to continue, or I run out of water.  When I first started picking skating back up I'd be sore / tired after around a half hour of practicing ollies and manuals, which turned into 45 mins, an hour, etc., and now I can skate for like 3 hours before I start to feel really tired out...  

And just focus on cruising around at first, to get a feel for being on a board.  Use it to explore your neighborhood and local area, to go to the store for a few things, to go to a friends house, etc. if it's not too far to skate there. 

Wait until you are comfortable cruising around on your board to learn tricks, you want the board to feel like a part of you.  After you feel 'one' with your board you can start to work on things like manuals, nose manuals, ollies, frontside / backside 180s, pop-shuvits, kickflips, heelflips, etc...   

And take your time learning all of these tricks, don't rush to land one out of so many tries and move onto the next trick...  I mean you can if you want, but it's better if you take your time with each trick to make them at least somewhat consistent.  You can always go back and work on them to become more consistent.  For example, when you learn to ollie and are comfortable doing it rolling, try it off a curb when you feel ready, and once you do it off a curb so many times you can work up to a 2 stair, then a 3 stair, etc...  

And have fun skating, don't make it a job to learn and master every trick as fast as possible, if you want to take a break from learning a trick and work on something else whether it be another trick you're trying to get more consistent at, or a line you imagined in your head while looking at your skate spot...  

And if you go to a park make sure you are comfortable cruising around and can maneuver well.  Don't worry about skill level, just keep park etiquette in mind (don't cut in front of people that are about to drop in, stay out of other peoples way, take turns doing lines, etc.) and remember everyone was a beginner at one point.  First things you should learn at a skatepark once you get comfortable are just rolling up ramps and going back down in fakie, then kickturns (frontside and backside) to turn around at the highest point you reach on the ramp before you go back down, and then drop ins and roll ins.  Watch the locals and observe the park layout and figure out what obstacles or areas will be best for your skill level."
punkpixzsticks,AskReddit,1390877625.0,"Four days before graduating high school, my husband (he was just my boyfriend then) and I got in-school/out of-school suspensions because a classmate told the principal we were having sex in the middle of the hallway. 

We weren't, we weren't stupid enough to do it in the hallway when we had many spots to have sex without being seen in the school. But the principal wanted to set an example, since he couldn't catch us at it. 

All that had really happened was I tripped over some stupid mats stacked against one wall, he helped me back up and the shirt I was wearing was static-y from the mat so I was fixing it when our classmate walked by. "

Does he have anywhere to stay? Other family, generous friends? If so, he should take the option and work on finding a new place immediately.  Even a shithole apartment with roommates is better than living on the street.

If he doesn't have anywhere he can couchsurf then he needs to start looking for a youth shelter or just a shelter considering he'll be a legal adult then. This will at least offer him a roof over his head and a bed to sleep in. They can also feed him and offer him resources around town to help him stay alive like free food box locations and possible low cost medical assistance.

Does he have a job? If not, he should get one as soon as possible. 

He needs to go to his nearest Department of Human Services office (DHS office for short) and apply for SNAP benefits (new term for foodstamps). They can also help him with job placement, bus fare, and maybe even housing. 

He MUST graduate high school or at least get his GED within a reasonable time frame. He cannot get anywhere far job wise without one and it's not one of the things he can put off while homeless.

The big thing that sticks out the most is the maps and game types in Gears 2. I don't like how they changed King of the Hill in Gears 3, and made it just ""King of the Annex""... I liked the non moving point that KotH had. Annex was alright, but I just thought it wasn't as good, I was disappointed to see it leave.

As maps go, Gears 2 had River (arguably the best), Blood Drive, Jacinto, Pavillion, Ruins, Hail, Day One, Avalanche, etc... which were all fantastic maps.

Then with all the map packs you got (flashback maps) Gridlock, Mansion, Canals, etc which were all great. And a shitload more other great ones. Really the only maps I didn't care for were Security, Stasis, and the combustible map pack.

I also didn't like how much screen shake was introduced in Gears 3. I can't even see anything while in roadie.

I feel like the biggest thing that sticks out to me is knowing what all the glitches were and playing with them. A lot of people didn't even know what hosts were or how to figure out who had it and deal with them. Knowing that some parts were broken made you work hard to find ways around them. I felt like it was the most unified game I played with my friends, we all always communicated and worked together... That may be also why it's my favorite. By the time Gears 3 came out, a lot of my good Gears 2 buddies had either left or moved to different stuff. I played a good deal of Gears 3 by myself and didn't enjoy it as much."

The main thing is that everyone's on the same page. This ties into your second question. 

Simply ask what peoples' goals are when you invite them into a run with you, before you start. Some people just want to run a Capture for Ember Prime, some people want to explore the map for all the treasure vaults, and some might just want to take in the sights and kill everything along the way.

julesandthebigun,Anxiety,1390878017.0,"Well, I can't help with the medical stuff but I can totally relate to having pain and worrying if it's serious. I had severe sharp chest pain on my left side.

I'm lucky enough to live somewhere that hospital visits are free and as much as I fear the ER I went and had it checked out and had tests and stuff done and turns out it's a super non serious thing where my chest cartilage is inflamed. Lots of people have it no big deal. I'm quite a healthy individual, and at the time I was early twenties. I should not have jumped to heart attack as my first inclination.

ANYWAYS, that is just my experience. I'm sorry that you are going through this and anxiety always increases the intensity of stress when dealing with other medical issues.

Is there a free clinic you could go to? I don't know much about medical care in other places but I know that after finding out my thing was not as big of a deal as I thought it was my anxiety about the whole thing went down.

Or like a phone number you can call? In Ontario we have TeleHealth where you call up and talk with a nurse and they tell you if your symptoms are serious enough to go to the hospital.

I hope everything works out for you, and I'm sorry that you are having to go through this."

For the Ayleid = Birds theory I noticed that although several meric civilizations use eagle imagery the Ayleids take it above and beyond the norm, their statues are birds, their armor is birds, their names are birds, so on and so forth. Further more look at Umaril's title, Umaril the Unfeathered, meaning he has no feathers, the fact that they thought the lack of feathers was a noticeable trait implies that the common folk had feathers.

Also if we read the [The Song of Pelinal](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/song-pelinal) we notice a few references that stand out. In volume 2 Pelinal comes back to the camp with his sword and mace covered with elven viscera, faces, beads, and feathers. In volume 3 Pelinals friend Huna dies it is from an arrow "" made from the beak of Celethelel the Singer"" These beak arrows are again referenced in volume 4. In volume 7 it states that Umaril had wings, this is where the ""unfeathered"" part comes in.

Also if we read [""Father of the Niben](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/father-niben) we find that the original inhabitants of the now imperial islands were a beast race of birds. The Aldmeri explorers thought they were beautiful and vowed to return someday.

and finally [The Pocket Guide to The Empire, first edition](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-aldmeri-dominion) states on the topic of the Aldmeri Dominion "" ""Breeding outside the pure line is a terrible, unthinkable crime, and taken as prima facia evidence of the tainted blood of the individual in question- if they were, they wouldn't have the impulse to do it. Exile to the mainland is regarded as equivalent to a death sentence, since there is no purpose in living outside their ideal society.""

So if anyone of those explorers had bred with one of the natives or even had the impulse to they would have been exiled, and as we read before Topal the pilot was made lord of the bird folk, so if he was excommunicated from the Dominion he most likely would have gone back to the bird folk."

From what I've gathered so far - if it's built on a trailer it doesn't need a permit, the first-built structure on a house often needs to be a certain size/have a bedroom be a certain size, depends on HOA, etc etc - in some cases.  Some places only allow RVs (if this would be classified as an RV) to be stored in garages and not lived in, other places it differs... I am researching it all.

I appreciate your advice though and will do my homework.  When it comes down to it $400/month rent for a bedroom in a house I don't have to worry about is not the worst case scenario.

*Psycho-Pass is set in the year 2113, where the Sibyl System is actively measuring a person's mental state, personality, and the probability that a person will commit crimes, all through a ""cymatic scan"" of the brain. The resulting assessment is called a Psycho-Pass. When the probability of committing a crime, measured by the ""Crime Coefficient"" index, is too high in an individual, they are pursued and apprehended—with lethal force, if necessary*

*The plot focuses on Akane Tsunemori, a new Inspector of Unit One, a police unit from the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division. As an Inspector, she hunts criminals alongside a special team of so-called latent criminals (people whose Crime Coefficients are deemed too high, and without chance of recovery) called Enforcers.*

Basically the main character is a criminal detective that works to solve cases... Nothing new here.

The fun part are the ""Enforcers"", these are people that were given two options after being deemed ""highly probably to commit crime"" but have yet to actually act upon this. In most cases, these people are pretty normal and can be very nice. 

1. Go to prison and spend the rest of your life behind bars doing nothing

or 2. work with the police investigation team to solve crimes using your knowledge and ""latent criminal"" mind to the polices advantage. You get to live a life better than behind bars, and can go anywhere you want as long as you are escorted with an Investigator.

The one Guido who was giving her a hard time(and other girls) got a two week suspension from all area locations  and I haven't seen him back since! 

I'm sure you're not the only Trans girl to use the gym and I know the YMCA has policies in place for preferred locker rooms etc.  Just go have a chat I doubt it would be a problem. "

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390878374.0,"Getting a period while being pregnant is not really related to the timing of when you got pregnant, some women are just predisposed to bleeding while pregnant. If its something that concerns you, ask around in your family, as it tends to be hereditary, if another women related to you had spotting or bleeding while pregnant, then its something to be mindful of.

10 days before your period can be a fertility window for women not on the pill if they have short cycles, but as you are on the pill, No day during the month is any more risky than another because you wont be ovulating at all.

Its important to remember that fertility is not a month-long issue for women. Without the use of hormonal birth control or fertility medication, the average women ovulates once per cycle, This egg is only alive for 24 hours meaning there is only one day a month that you can fall pregnant. Its very rare for this day to be close to a period. Its normally mid-cycle. keeping in mind that sperm can  live for a maximum of 5 days inside the 'seminal pool' (just below the cervix) there are 6-7 days per month that sex can result in a pregnancy.

Of course tracking this ovulation day is tricky and if you get it wrong it can lead to pregnancy, which is why birth control and condoms are so important if you want to avoid pregnancy. You are using both birth control *and* condoms *and* he pulled out. Pregnancy is highly unlikely in your case. (BC pills are 99.7% effective, Condoms are 98% and pulling out is 96% effective if all done correctly)

If your period is on time and of a normal flow and duration for you personally, its a proper period. Generally when you are pregnant, any bleeding you do have will be lighter, shorter or different in some manor/"

There are better rushers than AP not in the Hall of Fame. If Jerome Bettis isn't in yet, I wouldn't say that AP is guaranteed, although he's fairly likely as far as HoF predictions go.

Larry Fitzgerald needs 2,000 yards just to crack the top 10 which already has several eligible receivers who aren't in HoF contention and he's doing this in an age where receiving yards aren't as meaningful as they used to be.

JorddyK,Aquariums,1390878719.0,"10"" would likely be accurate for a generously large yellow belly slider or perhaps even a very large red ear slider. I have one yellow belly slider and one cumberland slider (they stay slightly smaller). I was very young when my parents got the yellow belly slider. I can't remember what conditions it was in before I created my 55 gallon and put them in there at roughly 4 inches. I also don't know if they got it from a friend or a store.

Also, sliders tend to grow quickly at first, and then slow down after they hit 5 or 6 inches. One of mine is probably seven atm, the other looks to be about eight.

I have a stockpile of UV lightbulbs that I replace twice yearly. They stay in a backyard pond during the summer. Their basking area is all set and the heat is monitered and stays where it should be. Their lighting is set up in a homemade elevated canopy and allows to fill up the tank fully and still give them way more than enough space.

I promise you, 185 gallons is more than enough for these guys, perhaps even a bit superfluous. That ""10 gallons per inch of shell"" rule only goes for small turtles and breaks down even more with multiple turtles. In reality, that saying just gives beginners an idea of the money and space needed to keep these animals."

Pachacamac,askscience,1390878724.0,"Exactly how long is really up for debate, but this is a process that takes millennia. Hunter-gatherers don't simply start farming one day (not the first ones, anyway), but experiment with crop cultivation, manage herds, etc. Over time, in places where agriculture developed, the plants and animals began to become domesticated and what we would call incipient agriculture began. Basically people grew some things, hunted and gathered others. If populations grew and people became more reliant on this incipient agriculture (because it can provide more food per square kilometre than is provided naturally) then agriculture was expanded, to the point where diets depended on staple crops and little or no hunting/fishing (though really, hunting and fishing often supplement agriculture, even today in some cases). It is hard to really see this process as one of agency, where someone said ""I am going to triple the amount of food I can produce in a day!"" or anything like that, but rather a gradual, evolutionary change. 

In the Near East and Middle East (Mesopotamia, the Zagros Moundains, the Levant; an area known as the Fertile Crescent), where the earliest evidence of agriculture is found, there was something that we call the Broad Spectrum Revolution that began around 20,000 years ago. Basically people really expanded the range of foods they ate. You can consider this the start of cultivation and the process that led to agriculture, I would argue, as people began to really experiment with their food sources rather than simply eat what's there. Then full-scale agriculture was happening by 10-12,000 years ago in that region.

The Near East is the earliest in the world, but it happened independently at least 8 times (The Near East, Egypt, northern Sub-Sahara Africa, two separate places in China, the U.S. Southeast, Highland Mexico, Peru and Ecuador) and spread from these places. These all happened at different times (though within a few thousand years of each other) and each region grew different crops, so that's why we think that they were independent. So it happened in some parts of the world first, definitely not all at once, although on a grand timescale you could say that they essentially all happened at once, since modern humans were around for 190,000 years before any agriculture, then it popped up pretty quickly all over the world. And agriculture did eventually spread to nearly every human group, but this didn't happen until European colonialism in some cases, so definitely not all at once.

There are probably 20-50 people in a typical hunter-gatherer community, although this varies widely. In some places, like Eastern North America, people would have come together into larger groups (a few hundred) in the winters, at least during some time periods. But agrarian societies are all over the place, and even pre-modern agrarian societies could number in the millions. 

I'm not sure what you are asking about language. What role did language play in what? "

Other suggestions I have are maybe muscle relaxants? I mean, check and make sure you don't have anything that would interfere with that but for the most part this sounds like muscle tightness that just won't go away. Or maybe a warm bath with epsom salts? A massage? Just some ideas, if those don't work or you can't do them because of other medical reasons then definitely talk to a doctor. That sounds like no fun.

Voyager_Nomadique,europe,1390878936.0,"Geographically, Russia and Kazakhstan are more european than Turkey - it is odd, but the fact is that the proportion of european territory in those countries is larger than that of Turkey. Caucasus is obviously european and Israel is absolutely in Asia.

When it comes to cultural 'europeness', it seems that religion can be a big indicator. It serves the purpose, since that way Europe ends in Spain, Malta and Greece in the south, ends in Ural mountains in the east. However, Caucasus is a bit problematic since Georgia and Armenia are clearly european, while Chechnya and Dagestan aren't. And just how european russians want to be? Russia has always been an entity of its own."

Still, you outlined just one model.  There are other betting models possible.    One downside to this is you don't know what odds your getting into.

For a more indepth market, you could have 100 ip units.  And you basically bet the percentage.  If you buy for 50, you'll get 50 if you win.  And there is a trading fee of one ip each time you buy.  Or a higher trading fee.  Also, this way you could make ip just on fluctuations in choice.

Eventually, someone out there will happen upon it randomly or follow a link that you plug in a more popular subreddit.

Sometimes subreddits grow instantly, for example those that result from one-off jokes in default subreddits (wheredidthesodago comes to mind). But mostly, it's a semi-long process building a subscriber base. Once you create a new subreddit, submit it to /r/newreddits and if people find it interesting they will subscribe.

Basic is 13 weeks if you feel like you can get away with minimal dilation for that time frame (I know not ideal, but you might be able to get a medical note for it more private room or sent away for medical or something )  then you could have a wonderful and long career in the military.
