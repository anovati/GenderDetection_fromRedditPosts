Decker87,MMA,1389080195.0,"You absolutely can control your T levels to a certain extent (and I do mean T, not T:E).  Notably, they drop significantly after a hard workout.  This is mostly important in getting the diagnosis to begin with - SACs require basically only one data point showing your T levels were too low before they accept a doctor's prescription.

Secondly, yes, they look at your levels but only to compare it against a maximum threshold that corresponds to the ~99.5th percentile of all males.  So you can abuse TRT to basically double or triple your natural levels.

Lastly, no one here is denying that TRT is a legitimate medical treatment.  But looking at the fighters who are on it (Marquardt, Duffee, Vitor, Chael, etc), I believe only a small percentage if any are on it for legitimate reasons."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389080203.0,"A fair point. 

It'd be nice if we could also toss away breakaway layups (not sure the tools exist yet for that). For example, I'm pretty sure (though I've only watched the Heat a few times so someone might correct me) that a significant amount of LBJ's shots at the basket are breakaway dunks. They have that pesky, active defense that forces a lot of turnovers. These obviously aren't going to have many foul calls and it'd be nice to just ignore them.

That said, it'd be fairly easy to add that into the calculation since Durant only shoots 85.1% of shots at the basket that Harden does. It'd be easy enough to to simply multiply Harden's number to get a fairer representation: 7.74 (which is closer to the theoretical 7.22) but then unlike 3 pointers, fouls on mid range shots and other shots close to the basket happen with some regular consistency (whereas with 3s it's such an anomaly it's easier to just cast this number off).

It'd be nice if someone with more time and access to stats than me could think this through and figure out how to calculate all the hidden variables in here. But it's worth remembering that I'm merely trying to show one how much officiating can inflate TS% (and thus Harden's perceived superstardom). There are a lot of other factors at play, like teammates, offensive schemes, and short shot clock situations that affect either foul rates or TS%.

For the purposes of my point, though, I would argue the approximation is fine. Even if you ignore the methodology, you have to admit that the actual result (that Harden gets roughly one extra call per game that he wouldn't get as an ordinary superstar) isn't too far-fetched, and seeing how much it knocks his efficiency (to pretty good instead of really good) was my point---especially when you consider Harden's biggest strength is his scoring/efficiency. Taking away those 1.7 points and knocking his TS% down by ~4% makes him look like merely a very good scorer, which isn't good enough to be a superstar when you're not that great a distributor (1.36 ATR) or defender."

codayus,javascript,1389080313.0,"Knockout is just about the simplest, fastest, easiest way to code a SPA app on a tight schedule.  Which leads me to a few thoughts:

1. If you're having trouble with Knockout, you'll have trouble with your custom solution.
2. Why *are* you having trouble with Knockout?  It's really, really simple.
3. Your deadline is super unrealistic if the app is anything other than very trivial.

I can't outright tell you ""hey, this is a terrible mistake"" because you've left out tons of details (like, what *is* the app, what does it do, which 30% is done, etc.).  But having a fair bit of experience doing exactly what you're doing, this sounds dangerous.

I **STRONGLY** advise you to objectively estimate what it would take to finish the app using the existing architecture, using Knockout, and using your custom solution.  I have a feeling that you will find it breaks down to something like 4 weeks for the existing architecture (but with super ugly code), 6 weeks for Knockout, and 8 weeks for your custom solution.  And if your client wants this in three weeks, then you probably need to break down and just extend the existing code base; it almost has to be faster.  Yes, it'll be ugly, yes it'll offend your professional pride, but you know what's super professional?  Making deadlines.

And a rewrite is a classic, classic mistake.  And as for ""rewriting it with my own custom framework""...yeah.  NIHS is an ugly, ugly thing.  I could write a custom framework because I have years of experience with the existing frameworks, but if you aren't ""getting"" Backbone or Knockout I guarantee you your custom framework is going to have massive problems."

We see it time and time again. So we end up rely on people dribbling and running at people rather than playing the quick pass.  We also end up with our Attacking midfielder picking it up in  deep or a no 10 who really is just a part of a 3 (5) man midfield. "

Borderlands 1

Bastion, I played 1 hour and didn't touch it for an entire year

I'll get to my point here though. I love every single one of these games (Minus AC3, still haven't picked that back up.)
A few months down the road, I was bored with nothing to play so I thought (hmm. Bioshock.....everyone talks so much about it, I should give it another shot.)

Martin194,AskReddit,1389080719.0,"Background:  I'm a Canadian-American.  Born in the USA to a Canadian dad and an American mom.  

The 2010 Olympics were a big deal for me.  I always cheer for the USA and Canada, but I was especially cheering on the host nation, considering they had never won gold at home before.  My friends at school knew I was half-Canadian and gave me all kinds of light-hearted bullshit but it was all in good fun.  

Then came the first USA-Canada hockey game, where the USA beat the Canadians 5-3.  This was following those first few disastrous days for Canada where, besides Alexandre Bilodeau, most Canadian athletes were barely winning silver or bronze while the Americans seemed to be running away with the tournament.  The Monday after that game was the part I remember most clearly.  ""Haha, Canada sucks!""  ""Looks like hockey is America's game now!""  This was coming from a bunch of idiots, most of whom had never even watched hockey in their lives but were now acting like it was the best thing ever and were being complete dicks to me.  I'll admit I was a bit of a dick as well, but that was the day I became 100% a fan of Team Canada and no one else.

The tournament went on.  Canada turned things around and won lots of gold medals, but those were just a nice little distraction from my main concern; hockey.  Canada crushed Germany like they were supposed to, then lifted everyone's spirits by crushing the Russians as well.  A close win over Slovakia sent them into the gold medal game where they would get what everyone wanted; a rematch with the USA, who had basically cruised through the playoffs.  

My dad, my younger brother and I watched as the puck was dropped.  Toews put Canada up 1-0 in the first, and Perry made it 2-0 in the second.  The USA played very well, with Kane cutting the lead in half shortly afterwards.  

Finally, the third period.  Victory was near; it was literally seconds away.  But it was not to be; with under half a minute left, Parise put one past Luongo.  2-2.  The three of us let out a collective groan.  It couldn't happen, could it?  We didn't even dare say what was on all of our minds.  Hockey gold on home soil had seemed so close; now it seemed almost impossible.  

Overtime began.  Back and forth the puck went with neither side putting it in the net.  With about seven minutes gone, the Americans gave us a huge scare, but Luongo managed to keep them at bay.  Then, the play began.  Crosby took the puck into the American zone with Iginla, and I had a feeling that something was about to happen.  Crosby lost the puck for a bit, but later got the pass from Iggy right in front of the net.  The light flashed.  The crowd erupted.  My dad shouted, ""Yes!""  I sat in silent shock but also complete joy as I breathed a sigh of relief.  That truly was the end.  As Sports Illustrated put it in their following picture edition:  

""Game over.  Games over.  Gold.""

huisme,Archery,1389080730.0,"As a primitive bowyer, not so much at the range as dealing with people who don't know much who sometimes went to the range:

* I can't stress this enough; no seriously, it never gets through the first time: **don't let anyone your height or taller or anyone significantly stronger than the average person draw your primitive bow.** If they overdraw it at all wood that is not used to bending will bend, and the bow will take on set, making it weaker at your draw length as long as it doesn't snap on the spot.

* They're no less deadly than their modern counterparts, and my best black locust bows perform just as well as fiberglass recurves due to the excellent qualities of the wood. You're not buying a toy. Treat it with the same respect as any other lethal weapon.

* If you can't handle the bow come to me and tell me so. Odds are I'll be willing to exchange it for something you can handle. Don't try to be macho and show the stick who's boss-- especially since you'll scare people waving the thing around.

* Don't shoot at anything that isn't a designated target. Again, these sticks are just as dangerous as other bows, and will leave holes.

* You've never used this particular bow and don't know its kinks yet; keep practicing, and DO NOT MOVE AHEAD OF THE LINE. You'll have coherent groupings after at most thirty arrows if you're not dicking around.

Thankfully that's every situation I've been in so far, and a couple were the same person."

Lolita ""culture"" is about being modest and ladylike; are you saying they're similar in that they both involve wanting to be more feminine?  I can't say much about ""masking"" as OP called it, but this seems to be mostly about looking more feminine sometimes while the lolita lifestyle is about behaving in a feminine way all of the time.  The lolita culture isn't something many people know much about (I was honestly surprised to see it mentioned outside of /r/lolita), so saying these are similar doesn't help it's reputation since it's already unfortunately named :/ so many people assume weird things (it regularly gets called age-play because of the name ""lolita"", despite one of the defining features of the fashion being modesty) when it's really as simple as a different taste in fashion and hobbies."

Sabu113,reddevils,1389080847.0,"I think everyone is entirely spoilt when it comes to Nani. Flair wingers go on and off the boil and do crazy things.

That's.the.point.

Look at the number of shots we had in the last game. 7 Shots?  We could use someone who shoots. And Nani has piled in with a number of decent goals from range in the past as well. That threat of a shot gives him options unlike say Valencia.

Or hell let's forget the shooting. Crossing. Nani is the best most consistent crossing winger we have by a mile. The only one who comes close (ok might be better judging by some of his absurd balls) is Januzaj.  And that's even on his weak side. Nani prefered the right until he got shunted out to the left in favor of Mr. One-foot.

Hopefully his absence sparks a bit of appreciation for what he brings and people will give him a fair shake when they watch (then again I strongly disagree with some popular assessments here about the Swansea match). He was our best winger last year for the few games he played and he's our best winger now. If he plays consistently, he'll deliver the goods.  We'll get a chance to see a winger get into positions where we can have some bullshit moan about decision-making.

It's hard to pull away from that other sort of toxic relationship, and even though you know it's bad for you... you keep going back.

In a country where it's easy for a citizen to get a gun, I can understand arming the police as there's a good chance that the guy you need to arrest is armed. In most European countries, it's rare for someone to have a gun (only person in the UK I know with a gun has a shotgun for clay pigeon shooting) so the police don't need to be armed for their own safety.

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1389081218.0,"When I was 20 I studied abroad in Beijing, but I sometimes left to travel while I was there, sometimes alone, sometimes not. I went to Xi'an by myself and spent one day in Harbin alone before my friend arrived. I also went to Japan to see a friend but had to get from Tokyo to his smaller town by myself, and then back again. I didn't have any trouble in any of these places. There are some activities that are more fun to do with another person, though, so I would probably try to think about that when choosing a place.  "

""Choice... Choice is an odd thing, Goddess Katrina. When I tried to escape the mines, and they caught me, I had no choice but to fight. I killed three dozen men in that damnable mineshaft before they could subdue me. They were horrible men. Terrible men. And yet... I still feel guilt for it. And then, there were the Marines. I was taken captive aboard a Marine ship, to be brought before my nobleman master executed. A Sea King attacked the ship, and I escaped my chains. And then when the Marines saw that I was loose, they pointed their guns at me. And I sank their ship. I do not know if any of them live, but I never had a choice. To gain my freedom, I had to become a criminal.""  
  
*Orville digs into the ground with his pick-hammer and pulls out a large boulder about his size. He stars carving away at it.*  
  
""Born into bondage. An innocent babe, considered property and less than an animal simply because of the womb he emerged from. I was never taught things like the children of free man's world. My education was made up of things slaves told me. I do not even know how to read. I hardly know how to count. My innocence was gone from the moment I began to understand the world. And a clean conscience and many lives are the sacrifice I had to make to finally join the world. I abhor violence, and yet I have an uncanny talent for it.""  
  
*Orville's carved stone now resembles a female figure.*  
  
""But it is not the only talent I have. Still, I would not be able to settle down and live a normal life as a creator of fine stoneworks. although I would very much like to. There is no hope of a normal life for a man who was once a slave. They will come for me, and I will be tried for the crimes I had no choice but to commit, and likely killed for it. I cannot let these men control my fate.""  
  
*Orville finishes carving. He has created a very realistic-looking statue of Katrina in her human form, swords and all. He turns to the real Katrina.*  
  
""I know how you feel about justice and piracy. When you first asked me if I was a pirate, I answered you honestly at the time. But since then, I have indeed become a pirate. The captain of a pirate crew, in fact. There is no other option for me. It is the only way to keep my freedom. I will never hurt an innocent. I will protect the freedom of those who are having it taken by anybody abusing their power, no matter who they are. I, Captain Orville of the Broken Shackle Pirates, have made it my goal to tear down the oppressive system that allows those in power to bring misery to those beneath them.""  
  
*Orville looks Katrina in the eyes. His expression is full of sadness.*  
  
""I will be branded a monster by those who rule this world. I will harm none who have done nothing to have harm brought upon them, but in the eyes of the people and their rulers, I will become a threat that must be eliminated. You would likely try to capture me, to take out the threat, and that upsets me greatly. I would have us be close, but we will be enemies, Goddess Katrina. I will not ask you to forgive me for what you must see as the greatest transgression; becoming a pirate. I only ask that when my name becomes synonymous with 'evil', that you remember me as I stand before you now; A man who knows pain, and wishes to end it for all."""
Johnny_Stooge,comicbooks,1389081226.0,"I'm not the type of person that shames people for what they like. If you like Superman: Earth One that's absolutely fine. Still, enjoying something doesn't mean it was good. 

I felt the book really failed Superman. ""blah blah different interpretations"" Sure. However this version of Superman had the benefit of having both Kent's and yet he explores using his powers for his own selfish gain. That, to me, says the Kent's did a really shitty job at raising Clark. It's also just a gross misunderstanding.

I get that it's ""relatable"". But I don't want relatable from Superman. I want inspiring. Clark can explore his options. That's a story worth telling. But those options should all involve him doing something selfless with his powers, whether that be something like doing charity work in third world nations or taking on whaling boats. He may not be Superman but he'd still help the world in a less public fashion.

If Clark were to choose a more selfish path in life it would be something like just staying on the farm. Not playing football for a major team."

Do harsh vocals make it Post-Hardcore then? No...

I listened to that one song off the album now and just because BMTH actually did something that wasn't generic Metalcore chug-chug-chug, doesn't mean that it is Post-Hardcore though.

And second, you can't just pick one song off of an album and disqualify it from being Metalcore and defaulting it to Post-Hardcore. I could use the same rationale and say that ETF's DIYLF album isn't Post-Hardcore because of the song ""The Day I Left the Womb"" or something equally as ridiculous."

Juanfran would be my ideal replacement, since Atletico are doing so well and we already have a few Spanish players that could help him settle in but I don't know if he'd leave Atletico and especially not if they keep up this excellent form.

If there is no semen or blood found on the accuser after a stranger rape, and the police believe the person is mentally unstable, then the accuser should be punished longer than if someone was caught in the act of attempting to rape a person with a knife to the throat? Is that what you are saying? Your argument seems very black and white, and that is very hard to understand in real life terms.

But yes, side effects can occur. If they do happen and they're something she can't tolerate, she needs to go back to her doctor and change pills or the dose. This can often improve things. There is a small chance of the pill just not suiting your girlfriend's body and if that happens, there's still contraceptive choices out there that aren't condoms. 

So basically any side effects don't have to be permanent. I know a moodier girlfriend might seem daunting, but you mentioned she gets bad period pain and I think it's worth trying some options and seeing if the pill can help with that. 

&gt; 3.) Any stories of peoples' attraction to their boyfriends changing after going on the pill?

screenmagnet,sex,1389082995.0,"OCD at its core is defined as unwanted, intrusive thoughts or images that you can't get rid of. Typically people with OCD logically know that their obsessions are not actually true, but they can't stop the anxiety and uncertainty that plagues them ('what if it is true?' 'I know it's not!' 'but what if it is?'). It's like your thoughts start looping and take over, and you can't shut your brain off. Often, people with OCD have no idea why they are anxious about the things they are. For example, someone with OCD may be very gay-friendly and secure in their heterosexuality, but have persistent  fears or unwelcome thoughts that if they touch a gay person, they will become gay. Some obsessions are loosely based in reality (e.g. fear of germs)...other obsessions can be completely illogical (like the turning gay thing).

Most people with obsessions also have corresponding compulsions, which serve to temporarily alleviate the anxiety. For example, someone who is obsessed with germs may wash their hands multiple times in a row to 'make sure' that the germs are gone. Sometimes the compulsions have no basis in logic, though. For example, someone may be afraid of harm coming to their kids, and be compelled to avoid stepping on pavement cracks, because on some irrational level they think that stepping on pavement cracks will cause their kids to be kidnapped. I once treated a woman who would cover all the photographs of people in her bedroom before changing her clothes, because she felt that the people in the photographs could see her naked (even though she knew this was a ridiculous belief).

However, not all compulsions are behaviours -- people can have thought compulsions as well (for example, the person who is afraid of becoming gay may be compelled to repeat a certain mantra in their head if they are in the presence of a gay person). I have an obsession with forgetting things, so I when I read a slogan or sign or license plate (anything that catches my eye, really), I will keep repeating it to myself in my head over and over again, even though the information is useless and I don't need to remember it anyway.

Many people who have OCD don't realize they do, because they think of OCD the way it is portrayed in the media (e.g. washing hands, checking the stove...). Sexual obsessions, religious obsessions, morality obsessions, and fears of being a depraved individual are quite common for people with OCD. For example, I used to have an incest obsession as a teen -- I thought this was a fetish, until I realized that the thoughts/images bothered me rather than turning me on. I once treated an 18 year old boy who avoided sex because he had an irrational fear that he would rape women. He thought he was a monster until he was finally diagnosed with OCD, and went on medication which helped a great deal.

In terms of figuring out if what you are describing is indeed OCD, have a look at the following websites which list a variety of common obsessions and compulsions. If you recognize that you have other obsessions and compulsions that are listed there (most people have multiple ones), then it is highly likely that your sexual beliefs are OCD as well.
ocdfoundation.org
ocduk.org
ocdtypes.com

Other questions to ask:
- where do you think your sexual beliefs come from? Can you trace them to a particular origin, or are they seemingly out of the blue? What is the underlying fear that drives your beliefs? You speak a lot about consent -- are you afraid that you will rape or be raped? Afraid that you are sexually depraved? Afraid that sex will take over your life?
- at what age did you start having these beliefs? have you always felt this way about sex?
- can you think of any thoughts or behaviours (compulsions) that you engage in surrounding sex or masturbation? do these help alleviate the anxiety associated with your beliefs around sex?
- what was your upbringing like? are you religious?
- any history of trauma or abuse (or witnessing abuse) in your life?
- do you have any other mental disorders? e.g. anxiety, depression, tics, phobias, adhd, hair pulling, skin picking, excessive nail biting, eating disorders, etc?
- anyone in your family have a mental disorder?

If this is actually OCD, then it's critical that it is diagnosed correctly, otherwise therapy won't work. The therapy for OCD is extremely different than the therapy you would need if this isn't OCD (e.g. if your beliefs stem from previous abuse or from a religious upbringing). Therapy for one won't help the other. Some people with OCD have had years of useless talk therapy because their therapist didn't realize it was OCD, and instead spent hours and hours talking about the person's childhood and upbringing to figure out where the irrational beliefs came from and try to change them.

Good luck. Whatever this is that you're dealing with isn't easy."

&gt;it's still 'job' that produces little measurable contribution in terms of goods or services provided, economically anyways.

Who the fuck cares? These people don't attack strangers on the street and harass them with jokes, they get paid for their performances, which are apparently enjoyable to the audience. Who are we to detract from that?
&gt;And most importantly, unlike the other performing arts, standup comedy is almost exclusively about self-promotion. Yeah it takes confidence to get up there and perform, but it takes arrogance to think that you are the focal point of it. For anything else it's about the music, or the art, or the story. Comedy is about convincing people that you are good enough to get paid just for being you.

I disagree. Do you think people go to a Beyonce concert to hear Beyonce's music? Sure, the music itself is what got them there, but they go to her concert because they want to see Beyonce on a stage, they want to see her personality.

And why is this even a bad thing? Comedians might be arrogant enough to think people enjoy their show, but if they (people) do, that's just adding happiness to society."

The Maquis are similarly a bunch of flunkies, from Torres to Suder. Tom Paris is essentially an ex-con. In the 24th century, where humanity is so advanced, the amount of fuckups in one place is saying something. 

If it were Enterprise, of course they'd act a certain way in line with our expectations. They would try to go home, they might get homesick, but they wouldn't stoop to the things you mentioned. Janeway and her crew are not chickenshit - they're *desperate*.

What you've introduced is subjective and has numerous factors playing at the same time. A good MMA fighter, even if he was broke, may have some social prestige and respect from people in his community (from men and women alike), and that does convey social status too. Besides that, it can give him confidence.

In essence, I don't disagree with what you say. It fits in with what I say in my disclaimer about all those metrics being almost useless to base your own self-esteem over. There needs to be something internally driven. I agree with MMA, sure. Collegiate boxing and MMA afterwards were a huge boost to my own confidence, so I can only support that.

I still wonder though. I don't doubt a Hobbits ability to love and their undying loyalty to others. I think that a lot of their actions are backed by love and loyalty, but not exactly bravery. 

For example, I don't think Frodo set out on his quest explicitly to destroy the ring because its evil. I think he did it simply because Gandalf tasked him to do so. Its his loyalty and love for Gandalf that kept him going. Same for Sam. He did most of what he did because of his loyalty to Frodo.

I feel like you are saying there are many many cases of people going around knowingly accusing someone of rape. It doesn't fit my understanding of the issue with false rapes.

But anyway, how would someone prove knowingly? 

I know with rape, they often prove it was rape by looking at injuries. 

Basically, you need evidence to get a conviction. If ""knowingly"" can be proved, I think there would be an excellent case for defamation.  Defamation is a more serious form of slander. Defamation includes things like malice, whereas slander doesn't. So I think there is some allowance for what you are talking about when it is ""knowingly falsely accused.""

&gt;Do you feel guilty after ?

No. Why would I? 

&gt;Would you say it made your love stronger ?

No, it doesn't really affect how much I love another partner. Each relationship is separate and I love each partner on their own merits. The biggest thing with not having a primary partner, is that if I'm not feeling it with someone (or vice versa), I don't need to hold on to them. We can part ways amicably. Breakups suck, but they aren't the end of the world.

&gt;Does it improve trust as a couple ?

No; it's not some magical 'fix all your issues' button. If you're currently monogamous and considering an open relationship, you need to have a solid foundation of trust *first*. If you don't, you're going to find your foray into non-monogamy to be disastrous."

If your intentions are different, then maybe spending more time on the actual talking is the right call, but it really depends on what you're looking for. Either way, keeping the passion going and hooking up on the date is probably a good call."

If you'll let me ramble...


This was the first time I've caught any D-League action, and I was entertained, although it's easy to see that many of these players will never play beyond this level. It's just pure basketball, and with both of those games being played against the defending champs of the league (The Rio Grande Valley Vipers - the Rockets' affiliate who have become renowned for raining threes), both matches were entertaining and challenging for the Stampede. I would definitely go watch a D-League game live, if I lived anywhere close to one of the franchises.


Like I said, I watched all of McCollum's minutes, but from the parts I watched where he was on the bench, it was different. He was just a step faster, a stronger finisher, a more dominant player than either team had*. He looked like an NBA player - not a star, and certainly with some rookie issues - but a promising young guard with a high basketball IQ. We already knew that part, but what was great to watch was his movement. He was cutting, driving, drawing contact and playing tenaciously. The team moved the ball better with him on the floor, and despite being -8 with McCollum on the floor (more on that in a moment), they won a high-scoring overtime game to split a tough two-game homestand against a good team.


The con? When McCollum was shaky (and he did look it at stretches, mostly at the start of his stint in the second game), he was beating himself. There were a number of wide-open threes he missed in the second game, and I think that was the main reason the team was -8 while he was in that game - he was a go-to shooter for all of his teammates throughout the 24ish minutes he played. He definitely had a few bad turnovers, but nothing worse than many other players in the same games. D-League ball is kinda sloppy, but I think I love it.


I saved the best morsel for last - he did all of his damage in regulation. As I said, the second game went to overtime. McCollum had reached his minute cap with the end of the fourth, and thus didn't play in the overtime. He also made the first of two tying buckets that Idaho would need to force overtime. They won without him dominantly, but I really think he helped set the pace for the victory in the fourth. Solid team player, really excited to see his debut tomorrow. I guess technically today.


TL;DR: Watched McCollum; he looked like a man among boys in the D-League. Got some potential injury rust, but moving well and playing team ball. Onto the Kings! **RIP CITY!!!!**




*There were moments with some exceptions, mostly on the Rio Grande side. Their shooters can get hot, but most of their players are just pure shooters. The Vipers' D left something to be desired (but so did the Stampede, it is the D-League)."

Also, the tenant could pay for the repairs and apply to the court to get back the money that he or she spent."" 

I feel this rule would come into play. You were in no way informed of the damage of your condo which would require this repair meaning there is no way you and the tenant can come into an agreement. You are responsible for major repairs like this, which I think is the reason the tenant just went ahead with getting the repair done but the landlord-tenant agreement comes first not the other way around. 

If your property manager did this repair, review your agreement with him. There might have been a clause in the agreement allowing the manager to do an expensive repair without your permission

We typically bring the new rats home, and take the older rats out of the cage and introduce them outside of the cage. Then we get the bedding from the carrier that we brought the new rats in, and we put it into the big cage with the bedding that's already there. And then we put the babies into the big cage with the older ones and watch. So far, we haven't had any issues with this method, but that's probably because within a couple hours, all the rats are snuggling together and grooming each other like they've been living together all along. I, of course, wouldn't recommend this for new rat owners or to people adding to a solitary rat. Nor to anyone who has any legitimate reason to be concerned about the introduction process (i.e. past issues and such). It's been about 3 days, and our babies are doing great!

Along the way you'll start to ask questions like, ""What did Long Island look like in the 1920s?"" and, ""What kinds of houses did wealthy Long Islanders live in in the 1920s?"" which you might be able to answer through research.

Armstrong, Phelps and Bolt all engage in weight training as an adjunct to more more sport-specific training. That, combined with the demands of their sport (maximal strength? explosive power? power-endurance? endurance?), determines the way they look. 

The more the sport is biased towards strength and power, the bulkier they are (up to a point). Look at the likes of Lu Xiaojun, Chen Yibing, Chris Hoy and Dmitri Klokov: they're ""bulky"" enough for most women to be a bit wary.

riseandrise,AskWomen,1389085014.0,"A lot of times I think men ignore the effort women put into initiating a relationship because it doesn't conform to *their* definition of pursuit... Or maybe anyone's definition, but hear me out. Women do a lot of things to create opportunities for the men they like to pursue them, such as by arranging to spend time around the man of her choice, showing open interest in his interests, striking up conversations, etc. All of these things signal receptivity to potential advances, without which most men would never make a move. 

To men, this doesn't count because it isn't straightforward, and maybe it doesn't technically meet the standards for ""pursuit"". But I think men would be surprised if they knew how many of the relationships in which they believe they were the pursuer would never have happened if not for the groundwork laid by the women involved. 

Men and women have different societal expectations placed on them, and the fact is that a lot of those expectations make it very problematic for women to be straightforward about their pursuit in the way a man would be. There are certainly women working to change this, but even without their efforts I believe women put a lot more work into initiating relationships than men give us credit for.

Edit: in my personal experience, *most* men are turned off by a woman who takes the more straightforward approach. So while I understand there are men who dislike the expectation that they always initiate, those men are still in the minority (again, in my experience). If being straightforward was an overall effective strategy for women, more women would employ it. It hasn't worked well for me in the past so I've mostly stopped doing it. "

LevyWife,changemyview,1389085653.0,"&gt; It seems to me your chances of getting the flu are higher WITH the shot since you are absolutely exposing yourself to the flu versus maybe not being exposed at all. 

Well, according to the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/flushot.htm) you can't get sick from the flu shot because ""Flu vaccines that are administered with a needle are currently made in two ways: the vaccine is made either with a) flu vaccine viruses that have been ‘inactivated’ and are therefore not infectious, or b) with no flu vaccine viruses at all (which is the case for recombinant influenza vaccine). In randomized, blinded studies, where some people got flu shots and others got saltwater shots, the only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot. There were no differences in terms of body aches, fever, cough, runny nose or sore throat."" So if you get sick after getting a flu shot, it's not because the shot gave you the flu. It's because your immune system was weakened by the shot and you were exposed to something else (maybe even another strain of the flu that wasn't covered by the vaccine) which was able to attack your immune system in its weakened state. Also, if you're not exposed to the flu if you don't get the vaccine, then how do people who don't get the vaccine catch it? "

The majority are following the version of Satanism as laid out by Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church of Satan.  In that religion Satan is purely symbolic.  As Christianity is about abstinence and obedience to god and the church, Satanism is the opposite.  It's about indulgence and self satisfaction, hence the use of Satan as their figurehead. He's the one guy who traditionally represents the direct enemy of god. In keeping with it's theme of being the opposite of Christianity it has it's own version of the 10 commandments called [The Eleven Rules of the Earth](http://www.churchofsatan.com/eleven-rules-of-earth.php) and it's own set of [Deadly Sins](http://www.churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-sins.php).

As a side note I think it's funny that to the general public Satanism = bad and Christianity = good, yet if you have a look at the links I provided, you'll see only one has rules about harming children, respecting others and animal cruelty.

As another side note, Satanism is the one of the only religions that not only condones homosexuality but encourages the activities that go along with it (as long as all people that are involved are happy to participate).

**tl;dr** No Satan is not a deity, he doesn't even exist, his use in the context of Satanism is purely symbolic.

djinnigirl,BDSMcommunity,1389085906.0,"Previous dominant and I had something that worked well between us: At the beginning of Summer, I was placed on orgasm restriction/denial. I had to masturbate every day, and provide sex whenever it was demanded, I was simply not allowed to climax.

Once school-time rolled around three months later, I was told that I would be permitted to orgasm once for every paper or test that I brought home that was graded A. If the class used a +/- system, then only A+ was rewarded. If the grading was on a percentage system, then I was permitted orgasm if I got a 97% or higher. Basically, only if I was clearly in the top of my class. 

I threw so many curves that year. I like orgasms, so I achieved scholastic excellence, instead of the mediocrity I'm like to settle for otherwise due to laziness.

I think the key for this exchange is that the restriction began before school by months, and I'd been allowed the occasional orgasm for being especially pleasing a time or two before classes started. 

I think if it had just suddenly been 'get good grades, or no orgasms' That would have placed me in a punishment mindset and touched off a reactance/resistance/defiance streak.

Instead, the restriction seemed at the onset to be 'just because it pleases Him' and by the time the semester began, it was just a way of life. Suddenly, I was being offered the chance for all the orgasms I could want, though. All I had to do was please my Owner with excellent grades. Easy-peasy-done. 

I have to agree with /u/pirate_jezebel. Rewards work great.

That's my experience with it.

**Edited to add:** The one time I scored low on a test due to laziness (as opposed to genuinely struggling with the content of the class, like I did in Chemistry), he did, in fact, beat my rump black and blue. Ten strokes with the belt for each point below 100. Two months into my first semester of Latin. I only needed that lesson once. Never again, thank you.

I guess that makes me more of a carrot-and-stick example than I thought."

1. There's actually a limited amount of math in CS. Not nearly as close as math is to physics, that one has an advantage when closely studied the other. There's linear algebra in graphics, and set theory in general. The mathematical portion of any programming is usually reserved for engineers.

2. It appears to me, he writes that this Asian male 'privilege' hinders his social interactions. I also wouldn't argue sociology semantics with someone who's entirely unspecialized in that field.

3. Quote

Dantilli,introvert,1389085921.0,"Try writing a mission statement. By that I mean write down a list, or whatever style of writing you wish that describes in general how you wish to act. There are a few examples of mission statements in the book, i'll list a few random points from them:

* Succeed at home first

* Never compromise with honesty

* Hear both sides before judging

* be sincere yet decisive

* I will seek to balance career and family as best I can since both are important to me

These are just a few random points to give you an idea as to what I mean. This isn't always an easy process, it wasn't for me, in fact this took me about a month and even then it wasn't really complete. Once you start creating this kind of list you start to realise what things are most important to you. 

If you're struggling to write, think about a situation that you had to act or you felt was stressful and think about why that was. Think about situations that have stuck in your head where you just wish you could go back and do something different. Think about what that something different you would have done is and try and generalise it. Think about WHY you decide to make any choices you do, really think about the motivation behind it.

It can take a lot of work and thought but it gives you much more insight into why YOU do things. Then, when you have a solid list written down and start to consciously act according to it, then other people's opinions matter much less. If they think what you're doing is wrong or you're being selfish (a completely relative concept btw) it doesn't bother you. You brush it off because you are acting according to YOUR values and you know that you're not doing anything that YOU think is wrong. The only problem is a difference in values that they either cannot accept or comprehend, hence they become vocal about it.

This doesn't give you license to be a dick though. It also doesn't mean you should assume you know everything in a given situation. You definitely should not assume your way is correct and expect people to follow it either, everyone has different values, different things they are working towards. Once you've got a handle on what's important to you, this becomes completely obvious, if it isn't already.

Not sure whether that all makes sense, I'm pretty tired at the moment. Hopefully this helps though. If not, read [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](http://www.amazon.com/Habits-Highly-Effective-People-Powerful/dp/1451639619/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389077749&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=7+habits+of+highly+effective+people).

Apparently, you do. Which is sad.

&gt;Pity us for letting people with that profession have some sort of 'star-dom'.

Why? If a person is good at what they do in our society, is it a bad thing to give them recognition for that? I do not think so.

As far as chauvinism goes, it is ""the prejudiced belief in the superiority of one's own gender, group, or kind."" In addition to considering yourself superior to pornstars, you consider yourself superior to Walmart greeters as well. This is a prejudiced belief. Therefore, you are chauvinistic.

So, let's sum things up. You: think you are better than other people based solely on your profession, you actively hope that another person's livelihood gets ruined, and you want other people to share your bigoted opinions.

Basically, taking on debt commits yourself to certain lifestyle choices in the future to enable the more expensive education now. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that decision.

The range of devices shows that the manufacturers aren't really sure who's going to be buying.  They're very diverse from small as possible, to entertainment center sleek, to traditional hardcore PC gaming aesthetics.

I'm thinking three classes of devices form:

1. Low end devices that mostly stream from a user's existing desktop.  A more useful and grown up Ouya.
2. Machines similar in price and specs to consoles.
3. Small numbers of high end machines. There's people who can drop a grand+ and want to get (back) into PC gaming.

I think many people are just going to install Windows and set Steam to start in Big Picture mode on startup.  The brilliance here is Valve just wants to sell games and manufacturers just want to move hardware.

I think a lot of SteamOS' success will depend on the following:

1. How well the controller works, as the jury is still out.
2. How many big games get ported to Linux/SteamOS.  Right now it's pretty much Valve, indies, and Metro: Last Light.  Civ5, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, Borderlands 2, Bioshock: Infinite, and The Witcher series would be logical targets for Valve; all are popular PC titles that already have OSX ports.  Stuff with big modding communities would also be a huge selling point (ArmA, Skyrim, Fallout3, etc).
3. How well the local game streaming service works.
4. How well designed and priced SteamBoxes are.  A lot of the initial designs will probably end up underwhelming.  I think there's a risk to the free market approach Valve has taken here: what if no one ends up setting the standard and they all kinda suck?"

Feroc,changemyview,1389086580.0,"&gt; When a Christian/Muslim/Jew/etc. attempts to spread his belief, he does so in the hopes of saving a “soul” from a tragic fate. When a religious man converts a nonbeliever to religion, he does so in confidence that he is bettering that man’s values and granting him access to a place beyond the lifetime we live. Thus, the spread of religion has a charitable motivation. 

How is it any different? If I could convince someone, that there is no afterlife, but only the life the person currently lives, then it's very charitable! 

Imagine a person who lives his whole life with some unnecessary rules and fears for the chance of an afterlife and then... nothing. A life wasted.

Also your only card draw is a single Mana Tide which is a high value target for most enemies.

Additionally you lack any Spelldamage in your deck. One single Spelldamage often makes the difference of Lightning Storm killing half the board or killing everything. The switch from 2 base damage to 3 base damage is huge. In the low end one of the 2/2 Kobolds would do fine (Thalnos if you have him), in the higher end Azure Drake is the go to card. Totem RNG is just not reliable enough especially as most enemies will opt to keep your board clear instead of just going to the face.

I main Shaman (rank 4 EU currently) and I run Azure Drake (2x), Earth Elemental, Sylvanas, Fire Elemental (2x) and Ragnaros as my 5+ Mana tier.

It's downright arrogant to think you or anyone on this world ""knows"" what happens after we die, which is what almost all religion is based around.

even people who have died and come back have varying stories, likely their mind simulating what they believe to be true, but I can't comment on that since I've never died and came back myself.

Honestly, there shouldn't be a burden of proof at all though.

People just shouldn't speak of their faith to other people, it's really that simple: We'll see once we die, now just shut up and enjoy life while you can, because you never know what's going to happen."

Brightt,AskReddit,1389087210.0,"This might be true, and I will usually never downplay my SO's concerns, but I'm sorry, sometimes she can be absolutely ridiculous and retarded. And if she does, there is no way I'm compromising. I'll get downvoted to hell because I'll seem like a dick, but don't worry, we're in a really happy relationship.

Two examples, first one happened a very long time ago. First of all, I'm one of those rare male specimen who can actually read his GF's mind and knows exactly when something is wrong, which ironically she hates, but that's another story...

Anyway, I knew something was wrong with her one day, and I asked her what was wrong. She said ""nothing"" and I answered with ""fine"", and kept it at that. The day afterwards, I wanted to give her a hug, and noticed that something was wrong, so I asked her again what was wrong. Her answer was that she was still mad at me, and I asked for what, because there was nothing I could think of that I did wrong to upset her. It turned out she was mad at me, because the day before I asked what was wrong, and she said nothing, but she wanted me to keep asking a couple times more, but I didn't. There haven't been many times I laughed at her harder than that moment. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to compromise or take you seriously if you act like a 15 year old.

Another time was when we got into a really big fight over the order in which I sent her a text message. I had had a wet dream about my best friend's GF, and I was teasing him with it. He said he was going to blackmail me with it against my SO, so to take away the pleasure of him getting to blackmail me, I just sent her a text message with the situation. She normally doesn't care what I dream about, but she got super upset because I started the text message with ""I had sex with ... in my dreams"". The reason she got so upset was because she read ""I had sex with ..."" before reading the context. And because she got mad because of that first part of a sentence, it was impossible for her to get un-mad when reading the context. That fight lasted for a couple of days, because I refused to compromise for her ridiculous behavior.

Sorry, but sometimes, if you act like a complete moron, I'm not going to respect your feelings, and stand my ground.

Other than those 2 occasions though, we have really good communications, and we rarely ever fight, so there's that."

Chinese in southeast Asia.I don't agree with her viewpoints but I understand where she is coming from, speaking as someone with Chinese parents from southeast Asia.Chua is not a historian, sociologist, or anthropologist, and speaks the 'buried' ideology from another culture. Thus in appearance, validating put down notions of racial superiority. Etc. Etc. Fact is, her viewpoint is so narrow. Only the most courageous, most cunning could escape china, and thrive afterwards. Even then those who remained unmixed from the natives anointed themselves the merchant elite of their host country. The neglected fact is that the entire mainland china was not nearly as successful. Many were still literate farmers, up until theses last two generations....even the success today of the mainland Chinese elite abroad are dubious. Half the people I meet are absolutely brilliant, the other half got here with just their dads money. Its quite different these days of men who succeed through with state sponsored capitalism vs outright unregulated merchant, retail capitalism. What do I mean?

IngwazK,TumblrInAction,1389087454.0,"Japan has some problems with racial purity and what not.  If you come to japan and you're obviously not asian, you'll be treated like a guest in most situations and anything you do that might be considered rude (if it's not too serious) will likely be ignored.  However, it's pretty much impossible to ever move from guest to resident in most japanese's eyes.  Also, there is the sentiment that people who are half japanese, even if they were born in Japan and lived there their entire lives, are not Japanese.  

Of course, not all Japanese think this way, but from what I've been told it's fairly prevalent.  Somewhat xenophobic beliefs are not uncommon."

The same with ""How I Met Your Mother"", we're all around 30 years all and we face a lot of the same problems: Serious relationships, marriage, owning property, getting in the job, etc.

ernestborgnine2013,WTF,1389088073.0,"I live in a basement suite. I just had something similar happen with our kitchen sink. Same thing as you with upstairs tenants not noticing. It was an internal issue in our case. The blockage was big, but still allowed some stuff to get through. When the upstairs tenants emptied the sink, the water flowed into my sink because that was the path of least resistance. It would eventually go back down, but I had a yucky sink in the meantime.

Based on what you've said, it could be an internal issue or an external (outside the buiding) sewer issue. Keep complaining because this could get (more) bad. 

By the way, if the upper tenants are flushing and the blockage is in the building, that means the stuff you are seeing in your bathroom is coming from their bathroom toilets and sinks. Yucky. Maybe ask them to hold off on flushing until you hear from the plumber/building manager.

In my case, the kitchen outflow is one pipe to the sewer and the bathroom outflow to the sewer is on a second pipe. The kitchen one is connected to the upstairs tenant, but I think the bathroom ones are all separate. If their washrooms are all directly above you, then I can see how the bathroom outflow pipes could be connected in your building."

Orelle,infj,1389088433.0,"Your quote reminds me of the [Fiona Apple song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K101lypWO0U), ""[Waltz \(Better Than Fine\).](http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858533506/)"" It might be a good one for you right now!

When I was struggling to find appropriate work, I leapt at volunteer opportunities, events, conferences, temporary gigs and any free or cheap opportunity to learn something useful. Volunteering gave me a sense of value, and something to tell people when they'd ask what I was doing. And if through volunteer opportunities and events you can put yourself in position to learn about new openings first, even have work offered to you because people see how skilled and dedicated you are, that's obviously ideal!

Never underestimate the power of evidence of humanity: interacting with the world in-person. Put yourself out there and demonstrate your value, while you search for an opportunity that fits. 

Networking and keeping my people skills alive were hugely important to me. And they gave me a much needed break from rejection — about that, remember it's HR taking a pass on your résumé and cover letter, or a supervisor subjectively declining your skills and experiences as not the right fit for a particular position; it's not you personally. You can learn from it, but please don't take it to heart.  

After my first three big rejections, I'd wanted to hide in shame. But I realized that makes it harder to reach and be prepared for a ""yes."" So I got back out there, stayed in touch with my field, maintained my hobbies, met some exercise benchmarks, learned new DIY skills (you can use some to make a little money, too!) and spent time with friends and family I tend to neglect while working full-time. And I devoted some time to learning new skills that made me more competitive for employment. All the above made me feel more confident, productive and kept me sane. 

There's so much you can do right now, of your own volition, to create and add value to the world, your life, and opportunities. I know it's annoying to hear, and it doesn't feel like it, but you are free for the moment. Be kind to yourself, treasure your time regardless of employment status, and use the freedom you have now to improve your position while you have resources. Time is of the essence, financially speaking, but it's also your friend. 

Also, if there's any way to freelance or be an independent contractor in your line of work, look into it. I don't think freelancing is necessarily the best option for an INFJ, but if it keeps you doing something you love, it may be worth it. 

Essentially: 1) don't isolate yourself, 2) try to keep doing what you love, publicly, 3) think outside the box with self-improvement and skill cultivation — you can use them to make or save money, help you get a job, or potentially create your own. "

That’s why children go, “look, no hands” or “look, I can do this” or “I’m really good at this”. Whatever it is. Because it validates them, it shows them that they are there, that somebody else is watching over them. Grown-ups are the same, not that there is any such thing as a grown-up, really. They liked to be watched by something. Because the planet’s not gonna miss us, when we’ve finished fucking it up and killing each other. So we needed the idea of God to have somebody to miss us, or at least notice that we weren’t there anymore.""

Trig is not a terribly big part of calc 1 and most people in calc 1 have forgotten trig almost as quickly as they have learned it.  There will be plenty of questions that come up in class.

Well, that's just like your opinion man.

&gt; What does it produce? 

A product that people consume.

&gt; What is it's function in society? 

To be purchased by people that want to get their rocks off.

&gt; Does the product produce freedom?

What does that have to do with anything? Porn is a good, that people consume.

&gt; Does it open the minds and capabilities for enjoying an authentic human experience?

Again. What does that have to do with anything.

There's a need: men and women wanting to get their rocks off. And a product: porn. Where's the problem?

&gt; to debase themselves for a living

Again, that is your opinion. People are free to do with their bodies what they want. What you may see as debasing might be perfectly acceptable to them. And that is ok.

&gt; They are going against the morals their parent's instilled in them as children and young adults

First off, morals differ from family to family so you don't know that to be true of all pornstars.

If you are that which is that, then even if created, would you not also be that which is that which has created that and includes that and this as one that? It's never ending in iteration if you speak of that which is all of that which you can know. As to the second..

Do you like the color red? If you do, why? Do you like living? Why? Is there something you choose to like which you choose to like purely because you choose to like, with no conditions to be known other than it is that? Are you predetermined to like it or do you just like it? Is it your feeling or just the sensation of feeling? If you are that which is all of that, aren't you too the sensation of liking that or determining that you shall like that?

Does it really matter if you're determined or not if you are the determination as well? If you are that, then you are not just this but also all of that.

tangerinelion,AskReddit,1389088931.0,"You must be pretty smart, though.  Smart enough to realize that IQ is only useful in measuring the aptitude of IQ-test questions and that the IQ is roughly Gaussian distributed.

If you have an IQ of 150, this puts you slightly beyond 3 sigma out in the curve.  99.7% of people fall within 3 sigma, and of those 0.3% that don't you have 50% who fall on the low edge - under an IQ of 55.  So if you limit yourself to others with IQs of 145+, you select from a pool of 0.15% of people.  If we roughly assume that the IQs are distributed equally for males and females - they're not because the test has a bias (I think it's slightly biased *towards* females but it's roughly the same) then she would have to limit herself to 0.15% of men, which is 0.075% of people overall.  Therefore for every 1333 people she meets, she'd find one she could date if that were her only method of choosing a partner.  (Granted, she'd reject 666 of them for not being men, and 666/667 men for scoring too low on the IQ test).

If all of this sounds like something only a terrible human being would do, that's my point.  She's smart enough to know that she is, with a great probability, going to be the one with the higher IQ in the relationship.  And that's something she has to deal with.  Most men prefer to be the smarter one in the relationship, those that have this preference will almost surely be intimidated by her.

lalicat,science,1389089067.0,"I grew up and went to school in the 90's when they didn't understand ADHD. I was hardly invisible in the classroom, quite the opposite. I frequently acted out in class and constantly challenged the teachers.  It got to the point where they let me out of classes I didn't like rather than have me disrupt class for everyone else. I refused to do homework and I wouldn't do the in class work or assignments. I would just read my social studies or science books all day and those were the only two classes I passed.  It got to the point where they thought I was actually mentally handicapped and recommended testing of my IQ. They were going to put me in special education. My parents were devastated I remember my father being particularly upset to the point of hearing a wavering in his voice as he told them 'my boy is not retarded, you just don't know how to educate him'. I took the IQ tests and I remember how shocked everyone but my parents were. I scored a 138 and had a college reading level in 3rd grade (all I did was read but only the things that interested me). They finally asked me what I needed them to do to succeed and I told them I didn't want to do the assignments or activities but I'd write essays demonstrating my understanding of the subject and if I told them I already knew a subject they should let me take the tests early and if I passed with a greater than 85 I should be allowed to go to the library for that period until they moved on to the next subject. This worked for every class except math. My ADD absolutely slaughtered me in math. There was no way for me to be interested in it in any way at all until a wonderful teacher equated it to finances. He let me learn through giving me an ongoing scenario that played like a board game. I had a salary a credit account and the ability to get bank loans but had to calculate the interest rates and payments also I bought and sold real stocks (tracked through the news paper and with my fake salary of course) I had to pay rent by looking up a real rent ad and living expenses. How much money I would have to pay for gas given my MPG and the price of gas and distance to my job. I'd have to figure that into my budget. He'd give me random events like a flat tire, I'd have to look up the cost of replacing it and adjust my budget or I could choose to pay it on credit but then had to calculate the payments and principle vs interest and factor this into my long term plans. I think he enjoyed it as much as I did and it taught me actual life skills. I was put into a special program that my school was pioneering called the 'IDEA' program where it was self study but goal oriented I had to do reports on history and we had structured debate and geopolitical reports we had to do about counties and policies in the news. All the while being graded on our punctuation, spelling and grammar.    As part of it we had something called full value contract that promoted team building and group activities that made you solve problems not by the rules they laid out but by what they didn't tell you that you couldn't do. You had to innovate. It was great, I became a top student in every subject and ASB president. I was forced to move schools and no such program existed at my new school district. I ended up dropping out of school in 10th grade because I couldn't fit in to the traditional education system ... it's really very tragic that they try a one size fits all approach to education ... it needs to be reformed."

Happier_,tolkienfans,1389089755.0,"&gt; For example, I don't think Frodo set out on his quest explicitly to destroy the ring because its evil. I think he did it simply because Gandalf tasked him to do so. Its his loyalty and love for Gandalf that kept him going.

I would say that bravery and loyalty to Gandalf are two separate requirements for him to make the decision. He needed a reason to go (whether it's loyalty and love, a belief in the importance of the quest, a sense of responsibility, or whatever else) *and* the bravery to follow through on his intention.

For their actions to be considered willful ignorance you would expect them to approach a dangerous situation with no conception of its danger. This is something you see to some extent early in their travels, but as the hobbits grow in knowledge they continue to face the danger, suggesting bravery has seamlessly replaced ignorance. With regards to Frodo's decision to undertake the quest at the council of Elrond, he is well appraised of the danger (even more so than the reader, as ""Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told"").

Yes, that's why I say we need to tax all sources of income rather than just work mostly.

&gt;This could make sense as long as basic income is already in place or will be put into place to compensate.

While keeping total revenue the same, naturally. It will mostly likely result in a lower tax on labor and a higher one on capital gains."

whoseworldisit,nba,1389090611.0,"&gt; 1) So it's ok to take into account the overall game when the statistics directly contradict what you're saying, but not when they support your point. ""His efficiency is low, look at the stats."" His defense is terrible, don't look at the stats.""

Steals are an awful defensive stat because there's no success rate to them in today's NBA. Maybe one day we can measure how many times a player ends up out of position vs. how many steals they actually get, but until then we just have the eye test. And having watched a fair number of Thunder games, Westbrook is ALWAYS gambling. 

&gt; 2)Yeah man, Rondo has been tearing it up for you guys lately, don't know why he wasn't included in the rebounding conversation.

He's injured, he didn't fall off the face of the Earth. 

&gt; 3) He has the tools, and he is using them. This is clear in all statistics available. Even the ones that are inconvenient (he's accidentally top 5 in steals because he's just acting crazy all the time).

Since you're so enamored with steals, the inconvenient truth is that last year Wade had a higher steal percentage than Westbrook. 

And this year. 

And in 2011...

His DRtg is consistently higher than most of the Thunder starters. Which is not a good thing. Also, over the past couple years, opposing PG's have averaged near as makes no different a PER of 15 which is normalized to be the league average. 

&gt; Today's Westbrook is better than today's Wade.

You still haven't touched the fact that Westbrook's TS% is a lot lower than Wade's. Probably because it's indefensible to have a similar TS% to Gary Neal who gets called out by his own teammates for chucking. 

Aside from Wade's rookie year, he's never posted a TS% worse than Westbrook's **BEST**. And even as a rookie he put up .530 to Westbrook's best .538"

As an example of my un-jealousness: she once got back from partying with her friends quite drunk. I had to wake up early, so I was already asleep. She sat down on the bed next to me, saying she had something to confess. Some guy at the party was hitting on her and she danced with him. After a while, he kissed her, which caught her by surprise and she didn't pull back fast enough, yada yada, she was so sorry, wish she didn't hurt me etc. I just asked her to shut up and let me sleep, I honestly didn't care. She can't help it that the guy tried to kiss her, so why should I make a big deal out of it...

She knows that if she cheat on me though that things are over. I set my boundaries very clearly early on in the relationship, she's free to do as she wish, and I trust her in everything (which is why I don't get jealous), but if she passes the boundaries, she'll have to deal with the consequences."

The_Rat_Cook,SubredditDrama,1389090977.0,"I understand your point, but I still disagree that the market place was a matter of policy because it plays into the larger question of ""Is government able and efficient?"". The marketplace, in theory, should work fine. The policy itself is sound, but the initial roll out failed because of the aforementioned reasons. 

And to touch on your other point: While I believe the private sector is better at business, I disagree with the idea that privatization is the answer for some of America's social ills (like the cost of higher education). I believe that the government should pay for healthcare and higher education (these two are foremost in my mind, but I am sure there are others) because these issues cannot be entrusted to not be exploited by corporations. 

Take, for example, for-profit colleges and prisons. The prisons lobby for stricter laws, so they can make more money off of the prisoners. That strikes me as incredibly morally wrong. Plus, there are examples of corruption of the legal system that has ruined lives. Government is not perfect, but it does not ruin the lives of its citizens for profit. For-profit colleges are diploma mills that devalue higher education. College is more than the social experience and a degree. What if The University of Florida was for-profit? The school would have incentives to admit as many as possible while not caring about the education given. The students would not get a good education, the education would not be as good because teachers would be expected to pass students, so the school can say ""Look at how many students got a degree last year!"". This leads to the education being shoddy, and the value of the degree decreasing. 

 While regulation helps (and I would argue is needed when it comes to major corporations), it is not the be-all-end-all solution for some issues. Issues, which I believe, can be better solved by government, like making higher education free for every citizen.

tarekiswhat,summonerschool,1389091280.0,"Gold I so keep in mind the info might not be the best but i do main jungle.

Step one: ward top for them. It is worth so much more than 75g to have your top lane know if the enemy jungler is coming.

Step two: Clear your camps then gank a lane you want to have the opportunity to roam after they have pushed their lane. Try your best to get that tower too homeboy. That's the thing about vi, she's got great clear, can take towers relatively quickly due to the fact that her e can reset the attack timer. and her ganks hit hard, especially with your red buff!

the pros.

either: 

A.) free tower and your laner can now roam with you to help out the other lanes, or 

B.) you make the enemy jungler come to help, so if your mid is doing well and they see the jungler top then they know they won't have to worry about a gank.

cons:

if your mid is roaming, the enemy laner can free farm and your tower could fall if they have good push like ziggs. if you're top, the dragon is a lot harder to contest.

S3 it was mostly support Champions, in the beginning Zyra, due to her zoning and people told me I was amazing on her due to my great ultimate placements. It changed to Janna later on, I always tried to steal a buff at lvl 1 with a tornado, worked out 3/5 times, which snowballed jungle and botlane hard.

Maybe your boyfriend loves video games; I mean, he *really* loves them. Instead of guilting him for ""choosing video games over you"" or whatever, pick up the controller and learn to play, too. This goes both ways. Maybe your girlfriend loves keeping aquariums. You pick up the siphon once in a while and ask about it. You find out why your SO loved that book so much. This gives you things to talk about, because the sex will only sustain you for so long.

Don't lie to each other about anything. Anything.

Keep separate bank accounts, but help each other out. Be clear about how much money you have. Don't shame each other for having different amounts of money, unless someone has a serious spending problem and it's causing problems.

Do things the other hates. I hate putting pillowcases back on pillows, and my husband hates refilling ice cube trays. We are very serious about these passionate hatreds. We do them for each other even when it's annoying.  I can't stand the smell of Comet cleaner, so he takes care of that when it's needed. He hates cooking, so I do that.

Compliment each other, even if you've said it a million times.

Touch. I don't mean sex, I mean the little touches. Touch her back when you walk by her chair. Fix his hair when a lock of it has gone rogue. Groom each other a bit; we're primates, after all.

Let shit go.

Say yes sometimes even if it's a huge pain in the ass and you'd rather be doing something else. Doesn't matter what this applies to--apply it to anything.

Take each other seriously.

Be kind, even if they aren't being kind. There is a line that they will eventually cross, and you can lose your cool then, but don't be unkind unless it's really warranted.

Fuck not going to bed angry. Go to bed furious. Resolving everything before bed just isn't realistic, and sometimes you need to stew. Anger can be healthy.

Give one more chance, but not two.

Say you love them, and say it often. Don't say it every five minutes. Mean it.

We'll see how far they get, 2030 is only 16 years away, and they have a lot of legislative work to do.

ANewMachine615,tolkienfans,1389092252.0,"Tolkien's view of free will drew heavily in Boethius, a theologian who tackled  the problem of free will and tried to reconcile it with an omniscient God. Basically, he posited that from outside time, free will and determinism could coexist, so God could have a plan and we could still choose within that plan.

This is pretty clear in the Ainulindale. Melkor is given the ultimatum that he can continue to rebel, but told that his actions will redound to the greater glory of Iluvatar. That is, he can make a choice,  but no choice he makes, whether to obey or rebel, will foil Iluvatar's plans.

zeugma25,TrueAtheism,1389092573.0,"Dear Mr. Albin, 

We hereby accept your claim regarding making it snow in Kansas on July 27, 2005. 

It is now January. Your claim states that you need 5 months advance notice in order to ""cause unseasonal changes"", so, causing snow to fall in Kansas this coming July 27 is squarely within your claim and your proposed test protocol. We accept. Go for it. Anywhere in Kansas will do just fine. And the snow must fall from the sky above, as if in winter, and NOT from a snowmaking machine, or from beneath your hat. The snow must be real. Go ahead, Thomas. Make snow fall in Kansas in July. Pick a city, too.

As for a time of day, how does high noon sound to you?

Here's my prediction: You will now begin to waffle. Or, you will start to make excuses. Or, you will ask why we didn't accept the other claims you put forth, as well, or instead. Or perhaps you will change the subject, or withdraw your claim because you feel that my ""attitude"" is too negative, or some other such nonsense. And you will NOT say, ""OK. GREAT! I will make it snow in Kansas on July 27, 2005!!!"" 

Or, you will say, ""Sorry, but I won't be in Kansas on July 27, so I cannot make changes there.""

But, if you actually DO follow through with this claim, I'll make an additional prediction: You will chose Mount Sunflower as your location. If so, that's just fine.

Those are MY predictions...for what it's worth. 

Your move, Thomas."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389093168.0,"&gt;Based on Poland's low unemployment rate at the moment I bet you could do better there then here

[Unemployment rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate) - Poland 10.6%; UK 7.4%;

I think plenty of people don't get something major here. Goods production in the world uses prices suitable for mostly rich countries (so the ones with highest requirement of those). This means that in countries where currency value is low it's much worse to obtain certain goods.

Now, the example from Poland. You earn there for example 2,000zl (I think minimum now is around 1,3k). This is probably at the approximate level of a job in UK for earning around 1.5k GBP. Current GBP-ZL is around 4.9.

Now, prices of certain things in UK (first) and in Poland (I don't count expensive places):
* rent - £600 - 700zl;
* bread - £1 - 2zl;
* buying house - £200k - 200k zl;
* PS3 - £350 - 2000zl;
* fridge - £600 - 2000zl;
* car - £10k - 40k zl;

and so on. This means that's its simply easier to live in UK, even if you don't earn that much. If an immigrant wants to save then it's worthy as upon saving enough in UK for a deposit you can basically buy a flat in Poland already for that!"

whoseworldisit,nba,1389093301.0,"&gt; Okay - OKC crumbled without Weatbrook in the playoffs. That team was supposed to get to the finals and rival the heat again, or at least the WCF's, but instead lost 4-1 in the second round. That shows his value to the team. But if the Wade is out for a series against a team in the playoffs, the Heat are still winning. He's more valuable to his team, period.

Maybe in the earlier rounds because of how weak the East is, but no way in hell do the Heat advance past the ECF or win the Finals without Wade. They barely did even *with* him...

Also, even though it was a 4-1 series, OKC was basically in every game but the last. It was no where near an overwhelming victory for Memphis. 

&gt; one of the best finishes in the league

See, this is just another area where his reputation supercedes his ability. 

Look at his [shotchart](http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201566&amp;Season=2013-14) this year or [last](http://stats.nba.com/playerShotchart.html?PlayerID=201566&amp;Season=2012-13) -- at best he's an average finisher at the rim, and that's including the position adjustment meaning he's average even amongst point guards.

&gt; but he's relying a lot more on the outside jumper than ever

If it's falling that's not a knock on him at all. 58% true shooting is great. 

&gt; Westbrook is far superior on the ball, he's one of the best point guard defenders in the league in that regard.

His DRAPM last year was .1, basically no difference. It was actually the worst of anyone getting significant minutes for OKC besides Kevin Martin. 

Wade's was 1.1

 Couple that with the fact that most ""quick service restaurants"" with a drive-thru make a majority of their sales from drive-thru customers, and the management is already going to be unhappy that you're not buying anything (if you went inside, there would likely be a non-cashier employee or two available to field your question, and OP's post is specifically targeting people who *weren't* buying food.)

A few of the comments have suggested that there would be quite a few legal implications towards your idea however I believe you are definitely on to something. Surely a more healthy alternative would be for rail companies to have buy back systems and schemes. So you go to a ticket machine with your return once you're home and feed it in, and it gives you say a tenner. So you've just managed to get back a tenner etc but then the train company can then resell that ticket. Not at full price, no that would be silly of them, but at a discounted price.

Similar to a picture I regularly see on FB and reddit the ""pending coffees"" thing, where people buy and pay for a coffee for those less fortunate. In a similar fashion it could be possible for it to be a case of going up to the ticket office and asking ""do you have any Blackburn - York tickets pending?"" And then the guy behind will say, Yes we've just had someone sell their ticket, that will be £15 please. (£22 one way) So you're still making money for the train company (albeit a little bit of a loss) and people are able to recycle unwanted tickets.

oldmonty,videos,1389094524.0,"Well here's the thing, you answered your question right in your post, YouTube has their TOS and the way they do business which has to comply with the law and as long as they do so they can do whatever they want internally. However, YouTube makes the bulk of its profits on the backs of the content creators who make videos on topics such as movie/game or product review. YouTube has a duty to these people as well as themselves to see that these content creators are protected. This includes preventing copyrighted material from being shown that would put both parties at risk of a lawsuit. However, in carrying out this duty YouTube has in effect sold out its partners, the content creators to the whims of the vetting process. The process favors claims more than users and takes the cash flow from the people who create the content in the first place. Ironically this is what the copyright law is meant to prevent, in a way their copyright claim system can violate copyright law itself, where it can award profits from a video to a claim holder for up to a month no questions asked, even if the claim is dismissed, that month of profits is never returned(most videos make 90% in the first 2 days or so). If the user was not in violation of anything then YouTube and the 3rd party used their content to earn revenue without their consent. In this case specifically they had no need to punish the user to protect themselves as there was no liability anyway but the still chose to do so and further to go beyond their normal and established protocol when dealing with the situation.

Hybrids are expensive because they require a bunch of extra things under the hood. Self-driven cars need extremely expensive sensors and a strong computer, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars together, but I'm willing to bet that by 2030 the price of a new self-driven car will be only a few thousand more than a normal car.

silverionmox,philosophy,1389094728.0,"&gt; Is that what you think science does? If so, that's breathtakingly ignorant. If not, then you're clearly putting forward a straw-man.

We took Newton's gravity as true everywhere, because it was true locally and in most circumstances. Now we know it was wrong. Perhaps our current understanding isn't the right one either. As a scientist we should always consider our conclusions provisional.

&gt;No, the claim is that the material world exists. If you're positing the existence of something immaterial, it's your job to provide the evidence for that separate claim.

I don't claim something exists. I claim we cannot know it. You can't dismiss claim about the supernatural because they aren't proven yet. They simply fall outside the realm of science until they're properly defined and there's evidence to work with. Until then, it's everyone's guess... and it's mostly irrelevant too, if there's no measurable effect.

&gt;It has nothing to do with ""liking"" questions. The question of ""why"" (in the context of purpose) just appears to be incoherent. The question, ""Why do bats have wings"" is silly if you're looking for a purpose to wings, because there is no forethought or purpose in evolution. Each step was a gradual improvement over the prior one, and that's why it was naturally selected. That's ""how"" it happened. The ""why"" is silly. It's like asking ""what happened before the big bang"" or ""what's north of the north pole""?

He enjoyed being human, but not living a human life it was dull, he tried giving humans their dreams and books or movies as life, but apparently magically Alan Rickman vampire zombie robot terrorists aren't that fun either.
Other failed fun events were public nudity, random orgies, giant monsters and immortal Americans battling impossible odds.
William, A.k.a backwash, A.k.a Montgomery or simply Mr. O'Neil lord of the universe was feeling defeated, until he decided to not feel that way and felt awesome instead, this was a vast improvement.

So after a series of slight fun(ish) improvements Backwash took his dragon bus to the office where he sold Chinese medicine to the underworld council of girl scouts and life felt a little bit more... substantial.

silverionmox,europe,1389094900.0,"&gt; First of all the analogy is not exactly correct, because going back to national currencies is a step back but at least it's the lesser evil than keeping the common currency in its current form. As Streeck said:
&gt; 
restoring options for currency devaluation via a kind of European Bretton Woods framework [is] a blunt instrument – rough justice –, but from the perspective of social justice better than nothing 

Devaluation would just as well devalue the worth of the income of the people. I fail to see how it's a meaningful improvement."

Add to that the idea that this unit was being investigated for a serious charge, viz., too many recruits dying suspiciously (one fell down the stairs, another fell in the shower, and the last hung himself) in one cycle, and others in previous cycles, and the drills were probably pretty concerned.

If the drills *were* abusing authority in order to create unquestioning obedience to the chain of command, then it could be argued that they were abusing authority.  Recruits were dying, that was a matter of fact that they couldn't deny or ignore.

Honestly, my drill sergeant was beyond sadistic, he was trying to get me injured so I'd drop out or get recycled somewhere else, so he could stick a thumb in CID's eye and get away with it, abusing the person he thought was the undercover agent under the guise of good training.

When he directed me to low crawl into the fire ant hill, I was bitten at least 106 times that the guys counted back at the barracks.  I was horribly sick for about 10 days afterward, and the bites got infected, with pustules at each bite.  I was dragging ass the entire time.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1389095513.0,"Alternatively you can start it on any day after your period has started, so if you start bleeding on Monday, you can put it on that same Monday. This method is useful if you want to be able to manipulate your period to arrive at a certain time of the week.

as a general rule, the patch becomes effective after 7 days, so once you remove and replace the first patch, you are fully protected.

If you put the patch on for the first time on the first day of your period, you are protected immediately. 

You can even put the patch on mid-cycle if you have irregular cycles and you don't know when your next period will be and you are eager to start. But with this method you should wait until you have used all 3 patches, taken a week off, and then when you put the new patch on after that break you are protected.

There is no reason to start on a specific day of the week (like sunday)  its just important to remember which day is your ""remove and replace"" day. The Sunday method is often noted in the instructions because many brands of pill use this method so it keeps things consistent. The important thing is doing what is right for your cycle, sometimes Sunday is just the wrong day if you happen to have a short period that starts on Monday and ends on Thursday."

We shared a hotel room outside the post and got steaks at some German restaurant.  I slept as much as I could afford and still leave a little time to enjoy freedom.  The guy was dick much of the time in barracks, but I couldn't have my pass unless I was paired up with someone, so I did what was necessary to get away from the drills.

As soon the pass was over, and we were back in the barracks, within a couple days he was back to being a dick.  I remember him crumpling up a piece of paper and throwing on the ground in front of me, telling me to pick it up.  I refused, and told him that he threw it there, so he should man up and pick it up.

Nothing wrong with dumpster diving in general. I doubt anyone here has been advocating going on someones private property/residence and going through their trash when it isn't already at the curb.

Edit: A lot of what I am seeing in here seems to be not frugal, but anti-business/sense. If you find a bunch of coupons that can be combined to get free items, that is not exploiting something; it is utilizing an existing opportunity. If a company makes a mistake and puts a loophole in their pricing or something and marks something down to next to nothing why would you pass it up? Because you think you are on morally high ground by not using that knowledge? If you see an opportunity, you should take it.

emk2203,germany,1389096447.0,"OK, I try my best against the popular opinion:

Asbestos is only dangerous **in the air** because the little fibers can go through your lungs' defense system against particles, causing permanent **mechanical** irritation of the tissue and can cause cancer by it. As long as it's just sitting in a wall, no problems. It's no poison and only harmful when airborne. Also, the ones affected by it were asbestos **workers** with **lifetime** exposure.

The asbestos scare is ridiculous. You would have a little exposure during the renovations, but your risk increase would be negligible. All the tests and experts just make money out of German angstiness.

Just to give you a couple of concrete figures here: 

The cancer risk for non-smokers because of asbestos is [21:100,000](http://www.lfu.bayern.de/umweltwissen/doc/uw_9_asbest.pdf). This is for lifetime exposure to the stuff. So, if you work with asbestos all your life, 21 out of 100,000 people die because of it.

Comparison with driving a car: 22 out of 100,000. So, working with asbestos all your life has the same risk as driving a car. Whoops."

Bevolicious18,AskMen,1389096620.0,"Again I can only speak for myself here obviously. The main attraction is that it's a hobby much like anything else people may keep as hobbies.

Technically speaking I don't have the ability to affect the outcome of many of the video games I play (almost all single player) because they are written by other people even if I get an occasional choice here or there. Yet I still enjoy my time spent getting lost in another world.

Football, lacrosse, soccer, and hockey are the sports that I follow at high levels. I've played each of them and am pretty comfortable with understanding the strategies behind various situations in each.

So while I can't affect the outcome at all of a professional game, I know what is likely to happen and can then compare that to what I would have done and what did happen. In this way it's interesting to me and leads me to be a fan of various teams.

Lastly and frankly most importantly in my opinion is the positive feedback loop that I get from watching professional sports. I enjoy being a fan for my teams and that makes me care for the sport, which in turn makes it more fun to be a fan and I care even more."

ep0k,Military,1389096664.0,"It seems like, on the one hand, you recognize that the frequency and volume of your intake is high-risk territory, and on the other, that you're keeping it under control.

It's easy to get into a mindset where you say ""I'm drinking for stress relief. It helps me manage a demanding lifestyle."" To some extent it might be true, but it's very difficult to see the transition occur when you're succeeding or getting by in spite of your drinking, not because of any relaxation benefit it might incur. People have trouble going to work in the morning and saying ""Hey, maybe I'm stressed out because I'm killing a six-pack every night."" It's very easy to assign unidirectional causality; usually it goes both ways.

With the military transitioning away from sustained combat operations people's garrison behavior will come under more and more scrutiny. It only takes one missed formation to get a lot of undesirable attention.

You want to have either slowed it down yourself or sought help of your own volition before things get to that point. Some people manage high-volume intake for a long time without seeming to ever let it get on top of them; for others its an inherently progressive process. You'll have to judge for yourself how serious it is but the fact that you're posting about it indicates you've got some concerns. Try phasing out or cutting back on the weeknight drinking and see if your on-duty stress level improves; high levels of workplace stress can be a symptom of, among other things, getting insufficient or poor quality sleep because alcohol interferes with your normal sleep patterns.

Clubs like City and Chelsea spend large sums to close the gap on United in this case, and routinely pick up and discard players as stepping stones like Jo, Santa Cruz and so on.

United however benefit from being one of the first teams in the door in a lot of areas and have a middle culture of youth and large transfers.

So some say Arsenal do it the right way, others say City and Chelsea have no chance with out money and others say teams like United and Barcelona and Bayern are in the right.

Reality is its a multi billion euro industry and crying over whats fair and ethical is pointless.

Btw United fan in-case that matters to ye, but I don't think you were being Dense or biased on the Idea or point put forward... potentially more narrow sighted.

Anyway, I think any type of world government will take a long time to happen. I expect that during that time we will develop democracy better.

I think its some sort of poor argument because we have no thresholds and limits, like how much of my team need be youth system before I am not buying the league.
City have Kompany, Hart and Richards who are youth or came in for cheap, but they are 'buying' it so where do we draw the line really?

Also more importantly why do we need the line?

I like seeing Mata, Ozil, Hazard, Aguero, Yaya and so on and with clubs like United and Spurs losing Ronaldo and Bale abroad we as fans should be happy that stars are still coming to our league to entertain us.

Megaross,promos,1389097893.0,"Your business model relies on the prospect that all companies would ass rape their customer base for 10p extra profit if there was no fallout, which in a lot of cases is true, in this case it isn't. Steam actually treat their customer base and devs right, everyone gets a fair deal, it's about mutual benefit. And that is one of their core competencies, they're very aware of the community they provide to.

If something better comes along, that actually presents better value to the customer base, then it's fair game. And that's where the competition comes into it. 

All EA are doing with origin is copying what Steam are doing and doing it badly in some sort of effort to compete, which will just never happen unless they bring something of value to the market. Which they aren't, it's like saying ""Hey, this knock off chinese Les Paul is a competitor for a Gibson"" it's just a watered down version of the original that everyone knows and loves.

BlueVelvet,korea,1389097987.0,"Regarding GEPIK, yes, whole lot of positions have been cut. Not every city has been verified, and there are still schools in areas that have had cuts that have other sources of funding. There are still teachers waiting to hear whether their school will have funding to keep them on next year. I've heard that cities such as Anyang, Uiwang, Gwacheon, and Gunpo seem to have had less of a blow than others, but I'm not 100% certain. 

So yeah, there are still GEPIK jobs available. However, there will be far more competition for these jobs. Many of the teachers whose positions have been cut want to stay with GEPIK, so they will be looking for the same positions. They have the benefit of already being in the country, and many of them have years of experience under their belts. 

If you really want to live in Gyeonggi, then go for it. But you probably won't be able to be very picky. 
Whether or not you want to live in a city or in a rural area is entirely up to you. I live in the outskirts of a city. It's certainly not rural, but all of my friends live on the other side of the city. This can be a little difficult at times, especially since I'm the only foreigner im my workplace. I sometimes envy my friends who have their hagwon ""family"". However, I can still be in the ""city"" pretty quickly. 

Rural is not for everyone. It's a year of your life, so it's important that you will be happy. If you think you will be happy in a rural school, then that's great. Nobody can tell you whether you'll like it or not. Look up the schools location, and see if there's a community for that area on Facebook. 

Korvia are good recruiters, and have a great reputation for taking care of their teachers. Best of luck!"

screenmagnet,sex,1389098374.0,"My bf and I bought the fun factory share (which is very similar to the feeldo) a week ago, and I have used it three times to peg him.

Pros:
- it really is awesome to get the feedback from the toy. I can almost feel him contracting around the toy, because when his ass contracts around it, it moves the end that is inside me up slightly (like a twitch), so I get real time feedback. Sometimes it almost feel like I am putting part of my own body inside him. Also, when I thrust into him hard, the momentum transmits to the part inside me, bringing me pleasure at the end of every thrust, and urging me to keep thrusting. I think without that sensory feedback, I would succumb to fatigue and laziness much faster (thrusting is hard work!). Since thrusting feels good for me, it almost awakens a primal urge in me to keep on thrusting harder and faster, similar to the urge my boyfriend says he gets to go harder and faster when he is the one fucking me. It's crazy awesome that I actually get to experience that, and the toy far surpassed my expectations with regards to this aspect.

- We went for the Share over the Feeldo because the share is less slippery and more grippy -- making it easier for my vagina to grip onto. Also, I like the size and shape of the vaginal part of the Share better in comparison to the Feeldo. It is very girthy, and it requires some lube and patience to get it inside me. But the extra girth makes it stay in easier (this is what I have heard). I also love how amazingly full I feel with it inside me. It's very erotic to feel so stuffed. I do still need to use it with a harness though in order to have enough control to thrust into him.

Cons:

- it is softer and more pliable than the feeldo. This makes the initial insertion a bit more difficult, and you need it to fit really snugly in the harness, otherwise there is too much give in the toy to thrust properly with it. For insertion, I need to use my hand to hold it in place. After it is in though, I can thrust hands free just fine.

- the feeldo has a cavity in the base where you can insert a bullet vibe which will cause both ends of the dildo to vibrate. The Share does not have this cavity.

- the feeldo has ridges on the part of the toy that covers the clitoris, which is supposed to add extra stimulation. The Share does not have ridges on this part of the toy -- it is smooth.

- biggest problem: both the feeldo and the share have a pronounced upward curve to the part that goes in the guy's ass. My boyfriend finds this curve to be too much for him. Because of the curve, you can pretty much only use the toy well face to face (missionary or guy on top) if you want the head of the toy to stimulate the prostate. We tried to use it in doggy, and it just poked him in the back of the rectum and didn't do anything for his prostate. Even in missionary, my bf finds the curve to be too much. It is angled great for hitting the prostate, but the curve is so pronounced that I have to lean forward over him with the top of my pelvis angled forward to minimize the curve. If I kneel completely vertically, it is uncomfortable for him. Unfortunately, it is much harder to thrust well when I am leaning over him than when I am vertical. This is a big enough problem for us that we are now looking for a straighter dildo to use instead.

- In some respects, it is better to get a harness with two rings so you can use two separate dildos. That way you can pick the best toy for him and the best toy for her independently. The drawback is that you don't get the feedback the same way you get with a double-ended toy. But the bonus is that she gets to use her favourite vibrator inside her (as long as it has a flared base to fit in the harness). It is just way more versatile, and you can rotate the guy's dildo in the harness to angle it for prostate stimulation in both doggy and face to face.

- because the double ended toys cover the clit pretty snugly, there isn't really room to fit a bullet vibe for the clit. Some underwear harnesses have pockets specifically for a clit vibe, but you can't use these pockets with the double ended toys because the toy gets in the way of that pocket.

Ideally, my bf and I would want a double ended toy similar to the feeldo or share, but with less of a curve to make it more comfortable on his end and also to be able to use it in doggy. But I've been looking around, and wasn't able to find anything like this. They all seem to have a pronounced curve, unfortunately.

At this point, we are looking to purchase a harness that can hold two separate dildos, and get a straighter toy for him. We will probably still use the share sometimes, because I love the feedback I get with it when thrusting. But we just want to expand our options with regard to positions.

Hope that was informative. Feel free to ask me any questions.

crankypants15,FeMRADebates,1389098666.0,"&gt; IQ is a highly heritable trait (0.5 to 0.8). For those of you not familiar with genetics, heritability essentially refers to the correlation between characteristics of parents and their children. 

Obesity and being overweight is also ""inheritable"", that doesn't mean it's inherited through genetics. People tend to act how their parents act, and that includes food and exercise habits. 
Just thought I'd throw that out there to think about. 

&gt; People with low IQs (LIQs) tend to have LIQ offspring, due in majority, to genetics.

I think genetics gives a person their maximum potential, but environment (like education) can help bring a person up to that potential. Don't underestimate the potential for environment to bring up or bring down a person. Being poor, and being exposed to lead paint as a child while living in low income housing, can cause permanent brain damage and lower IQ also.

littlestray,AskReddit,1389098780.0,"Yeah, of course. And as you say, for you, dating an animal lover would be a dealbreaker. For me, dating someone who simply didn't love cats would be a dealbreaker.

It's somewhat similar to the desire (or lack thereof) to have kids.

But all that aside, I do find it really unsettling when people proclaim to hate commonly loved animals for seemingly no reason besides their existence. I get not wanting to deal with the cost, smell, noise and hassle in your home, but being annoyed when you simply see someone else's cat or dog seems really off to me!

KosherDill,AskReddit,1389098804.0,"Just as /u/The_Max_Power_Way said a few little tidbits more about the parents.

Kate Hudson - daughter of Goldie Hawn who was huge in the 70s, 80s and is still relevant today. Her father is actually Bill Hudson who is a famous actor and musician of the 70s and 80s. Kurt Russel is her other father (not by blood) who was a Disney kid and grew to be popular in the 80s and early 90s (watch Overboard, it's hilarious). 

Damon Waynes Jr - is the son of Damon Waynes Sr. He was big in the 90s with In Living Color and quit a few movies. The Waynes Brothers created The Scary Movie franchise and have had their hands in many projects in Hollywood. There are a few Waynes Brothers.

Bryce Dallas Howard- daughter of great director and Happy Days star Ron Howard. Ron Howard has been on TV pretty much since he was born. His story amazes me how he went from little Opie to big time director. 

I know way too much about this stuff. There are a shitload of actors and actresses who are either connected to other actors, directors, producers, writers and other jobs within the film industry. These are the few that just popped into my head that are current/popular actors.

A few more - Emma Roberts, Rashida Jones, Liza Minnilli (however you spell it), and George Clooney also just came to mind. some of their connections are from people that aren't relevant right at this moment but they were big in Hollywood at one point or another. It's not to say these actors wouldn't have made it but I'm sure their famous family members don't hurt.

SublethalDose,dataisbeautiful,1389098972.0,"It is interesting that this seems to happen after imposition of rigid economic ideologies without regard for human welfare.

[Amartya Sen points out](http://www.nytimes.com/books/01/02/18/reviews/010218.18senlt.html) that similar things happened after ""reforms"" imposed by socialist and communist governments, so it is more about power inequality than a particular economic system.  Local agriculture with limited trade and transportation ties is not a great situation for ensuring food security, so economic reforms should result in more food security in the long run, but it only works when people have sufficient political and economic power to make sure that their lives are prioritized over the ideological purity of the system.

I guess I kind of fall into both categories, I have experienced sexual pain, and perhaps partly because of it I have a huge desire to become a sexual health nurse. 

Its hard to tell if my experiences have given me this career dream, I had pain from very early on in my childhood, But at the same time mots of what I want to do as a sexual health nurse revolves around fertility education and contraception, though a large part of that is teaching people that sex is natural and fun.

However due to other illnesses my body is not cut out for the intense work-life of a nurse, the schooling itself would kill me. My aim is to become a pharmacy tech, after which I can study Hospital Assistant at tafe, then be trained by an individual organisation to present health seminars, then if I want, another tafe course to allow me to teach at a high school level, and I can try and become a sexual health teacher. But I think I will be happy as a Pharmacy tech.

Thought my journey in finding the cause of my pain and managing/treating it, I discovered a long family history of genital pain. every woman in my family has endo, so pelvic pain is a common complaint, but after talking to them more, I found my mum suffered vaginismus prior to her reconstruction, my Grandmother experienced  dyspareunia after her episiotomy, My other nan also experienced phyco-somatic dyspareunia after the loss of her first child. each of my aunts and cousins has a degree of pain due to the endometriosis, though this pain is higher up, like cramps, induced by sexual intercourse. I also have this type of pain, But I only found out recently because Vulvodynia was preventing me even having sex.

The next part is long, Its just my story on dealing with the pain and finding help if anyone is interested.

Ever since I was aware of my body (age 6ish) I was aware my crotch hurt. It wasn't until I was 10 or 12 that I knew that the hurt was abnormal, I found it hard to sit, walk or wear pants, I couldn't wipe without pain, when I started menstruating I could not use tampons. My GYN used ""infants rape kit speculums"" in my exams because anything larger had me vomiting from pain. I never understood why people liked masturbation, that shit hurt. Initially my paediatrician and GYN thought I had been abused. My mother worked closely with me to find a doctor who could help. on top of the vulvul pain I had issues with my periods and hormones, and due to a family history of endo and PCOS my mum was worried.

I had trouble finding a doctor who's answer to my pain wasn't ""use more lube"" and when I finally did they're idea of managing my pain was to send me to a psychiatrist because once again they thought the issue was sexual abuse. I was told there was no physiological reason for my pain. No shit, you know why? turns out I had VVS, a bad enough case to be visible on ultrasound.

In my efforts to find answers I was wrongly diagnosed with thrush, the treatment gave me chemical burns (due to allergies) and what resulted was more scarring, more pain, and more struggles, because *now* with the open weeping burns on my labia, I was prone to thrush, as soon as my period would end I would get an infection. no GYN would look past that infection in an attempt to diagnose the pain.

I was due to see a new GYN, I knew they would want to get a recent STI/Infection test, I couldn't be bothered paying to see them, going off, getting the test, seeing them again just to know it was negative, so the day before my appointment I went to the sexual health clinic for same-day testing. 

The nurse was confused, I was a virgin, I had never had sex, yet I was asking for a full range of tests, and my file even showed previous tests. I explained my back story and she told me to wait as she fetched a doctor.

In walks the doctor, and she introduces herself ""Hi, I'm Joanne, the **Vulvonologist**"". That was it. I found it, the professional I needed. She talked to me about my my pain, She poked and prodded, then organised an ultrasound and CT just to rule out any physical abnormalities. 

During the ultrasound, a technician held the wand while a nurse poked me and asked me to rate the pain. Apparently this allows them to see the nerves firing.

The results came back, I had a severe case of VVS. We spoke about treatment options in detail. I felt completely understood and safe, the doctors listened and they took their time and missed nothing. After 4 hours of one-on-one investigation I left with a 6 month dose of TCAs (for neuropathic pain) a tube of numbing gel, a referral to a physiotherapist who does downtraining, a referral to a sexual therapist who will just make sure I know how to cope with the pain-anxiety and a pamphlet on vestibulectomies.

Within a month I was no longer walking like a cowboy and sitting on hemmaroid pillows. Within 2 months I was riding my bike, using sea sponge tampons and wearing tight pants. Within 5 months I was having sex with my partner.

Around that time I had an accident while shaving my pubes, Its a long story but it resulted in a trip to the ER, where they suggested I just go ahead with a partial vestibulectomy seeing as I half-did the job myself with my razor. it took about 2 months to heal and feel right, I didn't notice a huge improvement, But I had stopped using the numbing gel and finished my sessions with the physio during that time too, I feel the surgury helped to maintain the low level of pain I was already experiencing.

nearly 2 years on and my vulva has never felt more normal. I still deal with hyper-awareness. I know its there, I can feel it, but its no longer a painful sensation, its just, there. I still haven't been able to use a menstrual cup or tampons, but sex has been achievable. Since being able to achieve penetration I have found that intercourse triggers some intense cramps and contractions, I have brought this up with a new GYN who said its IBS, I'm not happy with this answer, I will be returning to my vulvonologist to talk about this pain soon.

The best thing is that it was all FREE! and I met all the wonderful doctors by chance. I can't stop raving about how great my local sex clinic is, so for any ladies in Victoria Australia, [MSHC](http://www.mshc.org.au/Default.aspx?alias=www.mshc.org.au/general) has a referal program into the MSH Pain Clinic, where you can hopefully get some help.

**tl;dr: I experiance/d genital and sexual pain due to VVS and an undiagnosed ""endo-like"" condition. A lot of women in my family have pain for one reason or another. I've always wanted to work in an industry that helps women be more aware of their sexuality, their body and their options. it took 15 years for me to find help for my pain.  I finally found it at [MSHC](http://www.mshc.org.au/Default.aspx?alias=www.mshc.org.au/general). I used a range of treatments, medical, physical and surgical. Prior to that I could not walk or sit without crying, but now after about a year of treatment, 2 years on from my initial appointment, I can use sea-sponge tampons and  I can even have penetrative sex with no vulvul pain (pain from ""endo"" is still an issue)**"

d3gu,DeadBedrooms,1389099082.0,"It was a combination of things.

Please understand that it was 4+ years ago, and lasted about 6 months, and I don't really remember a lot from that time period. 

I was quite unhappy: my boyfriend at the time was incredibly unsupportive and immature about it, and pestered me continually. I am sure that if he'd left me alone, or helped me resolve my problems, I wouldn't have resented him so much. It's impossible to have sex with someone you resent (for me, at least), so even on 'good' days I didn't feel like sex as it would have seemed like everything was back to normal, and that there were no problems. I didn't feel like using sex as a peace offering, as it would have been pulling the lid over the pit - pit's still there &amp; I'd be doing something I didn't want to do.

What caused it to begin with? I think it was stress made worse by an already naturally average libido and hormonal birth control. I was working 2 jobs which I didn't really like. I was part-time tutoring kids during the day and DJing various clubs/bars at night, often not getting in til 2-3am. On top of this I was doing a full-time Masters, which I found very academically stressful.

What did I do? I sacked in the Masters (which turned out to be a great financial and career-wise decision anyway), quit tutoring and most of the DJing, moved house and got a lovely cushy bartending job in a great little local pub. Unfortunately me &amp; the guy didn't work out. There was too much bad feeling &amp; by this point I had little to no sexual attraction to him anymore.

Sometimes I lapse into low-libido again. I guess I just need to be reminded that I enjoy sex, and to be properly warmed up to the idea - not just 'hey, let's do it'. 

What you have to understand is that for a lot of women, arousal is both mental and physical. You can be totally 'up for it', but sometimes your body takes longer. Sometimes you can be physically aroused or able to have sex, but not feel in the mood. Also, unlike men (who can usually get an erection within minutes), it takes longer for women to 'warm up' and it's not always the same things that turn you on each time.

I think it's quite likely that your wife has a lower libido than you, and it's quite unfair to use a hypothetical celebrity situation to prove your point. I'm not being harsh, but how about instead of blaming everyone (including Christian Bale), you focus your energy inwards and learn how to seduce your wife again.

What's the saying? 'The grass is not greener on the other side, but where you nuture it'."

I found some discrepancy on the coffee addition. Some people claimed that you added grounds at flame out, some added grounds to secondary, some added brewed coffee to secondary, and some added cold-brewed coffee to secondary. I went with the cold-brewed coffee, I thought that it had a softer flavor and smoother mouth feel. Also, instead of using 2 oz Kona and 2 oz Sumatran Coffee, I went with 4 oz of Sumatran, as Kona is not only hard to find at the moment, but it's also rather expensive when you do find it."

AgentDL,AskReddit,1389099142.0,"Successful quitter here (4 years). Remember that **smoking is a habit** and it is tied to many of your other habits or daily routines. During the first few weeks of quitting, it's very important to **avoid your ""triggers""** as much as possible - the things that you usually do while you smoke, like driving, drinking coffee, drinking alcohol, taking your dog for a walk, reading the paper in the morning, whatever. Obviously it's difficult to avoid all of them, but do it to the best of your ability. My office building has a front door and a side door. I always used to step out the side door to have a cigarette. While I was in the quitting process, I would still step outside for a short break, but I'd go out the front door. 

As for quitting aids, I used nicotine gum. What I liked about it is that you get to take an action that delivers nicotine to your body when you want a cigarette, unlike patches or pills which are more passive.

I've driven none of these, but I have the impression that while Mazda's reliability has always been decent, Dodge and Kia have stepped their game up in that department. Might be a wash there. I can't find any reliability rankings for these cars but I imagine you'd be relatively happy with them all, at least on the reliability front.

I know for me if I were buying a compact car I'd be looking first at the new Mazda3 and then at the Ford Focus. The Forte I'd grab only in the 5-door configuration, but it's (IMO) nowhere near as good looking as what Ford and Mazda are offering.

gasolinerainbow,brisbane,1389099182.0,"Dr Roy Lancaster at Red Hill Doctor's Surgery is amazing. All his standard appointments are 15 minutes long (long appointment 30 mins), but he will stay with you as long as you need, until everything is covered (that said, he usually runs on time - I have never waited more than 10-15 mins for him - I think this is because he leaves buffer time between patients instead of packing his schedule). I have a number of extremely complex health concerns, and he has dealt with them all superbly - prescribing/diagnosing when appropriate, and referring me for tests or specialist attention when necessary. He is also incredibly kind and laid back/easy-going - I am very anxious about seeing doctors, but he always makes me feel calm and safe and validated. Oftentimes I have said something like, ""I feel stupid asking this question, but..."", and he has always reassured me that no question is stupid and that's what he's there for. I am not sure if mental health is a concern, but he is excellent and knowledgable at dealing with those kinds of issues as well.

He is also very available. I can usually get into him the next day, he is there four days per week. His surgery is also pretty high tech - they can give you your medicare refund on the spot, just put it back onto your eftpos card instantly, which is always really nice. They also allow you to book appointments via iPhone app, if you want to - I LOVE doing this, because I hate talking to secretaries on the phone, and it allows me to see all available appointments and pick one instead of taking what I'm offered. It also makes it easier to cancel/change appointments. Oh, and they also have a healthscope pathology office on the premises (right across from Dr Lancaster's office, actually), so if you need a blood test you can have it right then and there. As a bonus, there's two pharmacies within walking distance of the surgery - I would recommend the one at Red Hill Plaza (next to the 7-11), because it's cheaper/bigger. 

Cost wise, they don't bulk bill (they do offer a discount for pensioners or HCC holders), but they aren't extraordinarily expensive. After the instant medicare rebate, I usually pay about $35 for a standard appointment. 

The website for the surgery is [here](http://www.redhilldoctors.com.au). I can't recommend him highly enough. "

Massive even has little bit hinted that E3 demo was barely in working state and they had coders at backstage just in case it would blow in theirs faces. That coupled with this rumor that engine is now up and running suggests, to me, Ubisoft is assuming that Massive can deliver game in less than 12 months of development.

This is different from the average ""normal period"" because those do contain eggs, from when the woman ovulated but did not get pregnant. The pill prevents ovulation, no ovulation, no egg.

There is really no difference between a period and a withdraw bleed, they are both triggered by progesterone, they both involve the shedding of the uterus lining, and they are both good indicators that you are probably not pregnant.

Some people just like making the distinction that periods while on the pill never contain eggs, and are not caused by your natural hormones but rather a withdrawal to the artificial hormones in the pill."

AshleyYakeley,PurplePillDebate,1389099515.0,"I think women's dating advice to men is bad because men's and women's interests are actually not aligned. Of course, both win when they make a connection. But when a man is too bold to an uninterested woman, she loses more than he does.

Red Pill advice thus tends to lean towards boldness, forwardness and risk-taking. [Here's an example:](http://heartiste.wordpress.com/the-sixteen-commandments-of-poon/)

&gt; XIII. Err on the side of too much boldness, rather than too little

&gt; Touching a woman inappropriately on the first date will get you further with her than not touching her at all. Don’t let a woman’s faux indignation at your boldness sway you; they secretly love it when a man aggressively pursues what he wants and makes his sexual intentions known. You don’t have to be an asshole, but if you have no choice, being an inconsiderate asshole beats being a polite beta, every time.

This is good advice in pursuit of Red Pill goals, which is generally simply to get laid. They don't really care how much it annoys women when it backfires, even if that's more often than not.

Blue Pill (or rather, feminist) advice leans towards politeness and safety. [Here's an example:](http://everydayfeminism.com/2013/01/feminist-guide-to-non-creepy-flirting/)

&gt; So please, if you see a boundary in the flirting stage, respect it. It shows you’re not the kind of guy that thinks a woman owes him something just because he noticed her.

&gt;And if you see one of your friends disrespecting someone’s boundaries in an attempt to flirt, have a talk with them or show them this article.

Feminists tend to take a very black-and-white view of sexual consent issues in general, and [this is no exception](http://everydayfeminism.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m8ic9dM90a1qlwxojo1_1280.jpg).

Disappointment? Dupuis going out for the season. 

The NHL in general:

Surprise: Alex Steen. A breakout year this late in the game defies the odds like Han Solo in an asteroid field. 

Disappointment: American goalies not names Ryan Miller. Don't get me wrong, I loooooove me some Miller Time, but I really had hoped to see a much tighter battle at the top.

screenmagnet,sex,1389099873.0,"They have had trouble finding a method that:

- stops sperm production without permanently affecting it
- uses hormones without killing sex drive
- has few side effects (men are less willing to put up with risks and side effects than women are).

While there is a small minority of men who really desire more male-controlled birth control options, the fact is that the overall market for male birth control is much, much smaller than the market for female birth control. There are several reasons for this. First, men are much less likely to go to the doctor than women are. Men are also less willing to deal with the hassle of taking meds. They are much more fearful of side effects, especially anything related to sex drive, fertility, hormones, or erectile function. They are more fearful of surgical or other procedures that involve their genitals than women are, and less willing to tolerate pain and healing in that area. There is an unfortunate attitude among many men that birth control should be the woman's responsibility since she is the one who gets pregnant. Many men have only dated women who were on the pill, so they have been conditioned to never  worry about birth control and just leave it up to the woman.

Personally, as a woman who refuses to use hormonal methods of birth control, and doesn't like condoms, I would LOVE it if there were more birth control options for men. God, how I would love leaving it all in my bf's hands and never having to worry about it ever again. We have been using withdrawal consistently for the past four years, and I really enjoy that my boyfriend is taking the entire burden of contraception upon himself. I think it's sexy that he is an active participant in contraception. I think it shows maturity and responsibility, and it makes me respect him more as a partner knowing that I can rely on him for something so important as preventing me from getting pregnant. I also of course enjoy no longer dealing with side effects from the pill or worrying about the long term risks. I like having a natural cycle, with variations in mood, energy, stamina, and sex drive throughout the month.

But, it sucks that he has to pull out and doesn't get to come inside me. He really misses coming inside me, and much prefers it to pulling out. I have tried to talk him into freezing sperm and getting a vasectomy, but he is not open to the idea at all. : /"
SirNuke,OutOfTheLoop,1389099877.0,"Phil Robertson is the patriarch of the family behind Duck Commander.  It's an extremely successful company that sells [duck calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_call) and stars on the A&amp;E reality series [*Duck Dynasty*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_Dynasty).  The show is also extremely popular, and I believe it's the most successful show ever on A&amp;E.

Robertson recently had an interview with [*GQ Magazine*](http://www.gq.com/entertainment/television/201401/duck-dynasty-phil-robertson) where he more or less compares homosexuality to bestiality, states that homosexuality is against the Bible, and claims blacks had better lives before the Civil Rights movement.  The Internet explodes a bit.  A&amp;E issues a strong statement condemning and suspends him.  The Internet completely explodes.  Nine days later, A&amp;E calls off his suspension, and now the show starts airing its 5th season on the 15th.

There's arguments about his free speech rights, over his religious views, whether what he said was really terrible, if he was provoked by the interviewer, and how out of the ordinary or unexpected this is for an older man who grew up in the deep south.  It should be fairly obvious why there was a lot of hate directed towards him, and why many people objected to his suspension - regardless of which 'side' you agree more with.

I will note that it's also come out that he's made some very racist statements about Muslims and that men should marry 15 year old women in the past.  Neither of those have caused much exploding, however.

Personally, I'm on the side that he's a bigot, but I don't know if that's necessary cause to fire him.  A&amp;E was probably just trying to weather the storm with the suspension, and I don't really blame them."

sharshenka,literature,1389099893.0,"I don't think he was depressed in the ""I'm so miserable all the time"" way, but I think he was a bit bipolar and, more than anything, very impulsive. I think it was the impulsiveness that made him kill himself.

Throughout his story, we see that he doesn't really have a very good eye to the future. Like when he not only buys more food than he needs upon arriving in Bruges, he also gives most of it away. He came to Bruges on a whim, and now has no backup plan. He also steals for extra money, but tgen buys *stuff* instead of trying to pay off his creditors - so even when he could be fixing his situation, he doesn't. He's also not good at considering the emotions of other people long term. He should have been able to see getting involved with Jocasta would be an issue, and has no problem telling Sixsmith about random sexual conquests, and even encouraging him to ""try women"", both of which are pretty dickish things to do to someone who loves you.

Overall, I think his biggest mistake was leaving Ayers. Was his situation really that bad? He says himself that he is basically receiving masters classes, and that his music has improved under Ayers influence. So, Ayers is taking some of Roberts ideas. He is clearly on death's door. If Robert were able to hold out for a little while longer, he probably would have been able to use his Sextet to launch a career. He stood to gain much more than Ayers from the relationship. Instead, he goes off in a huff, then kills himself with the same impulsiveness that brought him to Bruges in the first place."

Sometimes I think blokes have a harder (pardon the pun) time of it.

Plus, men are expected to be able to perform all the time.

There's the stereotype that man asks the woman for sex. Of course, it's not true in the 'real world', but I guess that it's ok for women to decline sexytimes &amp; it's just brushed off as 'oh there's the redblooded man always wanting sex'.

They're called brush fires where I live because pine needles [such as these](http://www.mayang.com/textures/Plants/images/Dried%20Dead%20Plants/dried_pine_needles_9250031.JPG) cover almost every square foot of where I live and are commonly referred to as brush for whatever reason. They catch fire very easily and spreads extremely fast. 

Where I live is set up like [this](http://imgur.com/m3INN6o). Note where 'supreme asshole' is and where I am. 

So a few years ago, I'm minding my own business in gym class when I hear an announcement over the loudspeaker that the school bus that I ride home on was canceled due to a *'situation'*. So, jokingly, I said to a friend of mine who rides the same bus, ""I'll bet you there's a fire on my street.” Ha ha. I asked for permission and went with said friend to the school dean to find out what was going on as he was the one who made the announcement. He then tells me that there's a fire on a few of the streets that my bus route covers, one of them being mine. Sigh. So, whatever, I called my brother and found out that he had already been waiting out front for me. I left with him when school ended, thinking that it was no big deal because we had had fires before where I used to live - nope. I got there to find a plethora of police cruisers and firetrucks that appeared to have come by the boatload all the way down the long street that all the other streets ran perpendicular to. But I figured, hey, whatever - where I live cops have nothing to do since it's a low crime area, so they just accumulate when something mildly interesting happens. It happens all the time. We passed through all of the trees that formed a canopy around the road to look to the right and see smoke *everywhere*. It looked really, really terrible. Once we got to our street, we couldn’t see 10 feet in front of the car. Everyone in my family knew that our house was going to burn down. And the worst part - while everyone managed to grab the dogs, nobody remembered to fucking take my hamster. So I was left sitting in my brother's car for a good 8 hours on the end of our street waiting for the fire to be put out, basically having a panic attack over the fact that my hamster was going to die alone from smoke inhalation. It turned out that supreme asshole from almost 3 streets over decided to leave hot coals from his grill out to cool *beneath a tree.* So obviously, that caught fire, and then the fire spread across the road to the other side of his street, crossed through the houses inbetween that street and mine, and went across to my side of the street where my house was. It even went all the way across the river that's shown in the picture. Keep in mind that everyone where I live has a house on at the very least 2.5 acres of land, most of us being on 5-10 acres. So this covered a good square mile. But, I guess the firefighters managed to keep putting it out as it was spreading, so only a barn ended up being burnt down. My house was fine. My hamster ended up dying a year later from cancer.

This wasn’t supposed to be this long, but, moral of the story - don’t move to Collier County, Florida."

No contact is the best idea. If he changes his mind and realises what he's giving up, there is absolutely nothing to stop him getting in touch.

A number of them sit next to me and invariably one will walk over to the other and they'll start with how they like how the other did their hair and it goes from there. People say crude/salty stuff all the time (both men and women) and could easily get fired if someone had a little too much sand in their vagina. 

Personally, I tend to go the other way with female coworkers until they ""go there"" and let me realize they're not über sensitive. Even then, I'm generally very careful with what I say and do. I have a mortgage and am not going to let some bullshit joke bring me down. 

As someone with daughters, I'm definitely sensitive to guys making women feel uncomfortable. So again, if a woman is within earshot those guys should have not made sexual jokes. But to get q guy **fired** for making a dongle joke? Trying to publicly shame them? Not cool at all.

I'm not saying other developers aren't familiar with PC space, but studios that have been *PC exclusive* most likely will have some edge.

What may have caused delays and issues with tech development for e.g. Massive is how Sony &amp; MS kept changing specs and basic *How console will work* -plans until very last minute. DICE has little bit talked about how sudden changes kept throwing them back to drawing board with FB 3 and Bf 4.

In the end, if we were to believe rumor as fact, Snowdrop took longer to get up and running as intended than Massive expected and Ubisoft jumped the gun with release window announcement.

That all said I find this quote little bit funny, from article;

&gt;The game engine works well, it is not clear but works well.

Does it mean that engine works well, but they aren't 100% sure why it works well **or** that engine works well, but because of possible rush there is slight mess in code, but it still manages to work?

is a pretty bad outlook to have about giving someone a gift, imo.  If my partner was about to purchase something expensive (in the thousands) with the attitude of ""if she doesn't like it, tough nuts,"" I'd wonder why on earth he was spending so much.

codayus,AskMen,1389100890.0,"There's two real approaches you can take here.

First, you can look at this subjectively.  There's this thing, it makes you uncomfortable, and that's an issue.  You aren't ""silly"" for struggling to handle it any more than I'm silly due to my strong dislike of peas.  Unfortunately, much like my feelings about peas, there's not a lot you can do about it.  Either you grit your teeth and ignore the (metaphorical) peas or you go and find something to eat not tained with the demon vegetable.

Second, you can look at this objectively.

&gt; When I am at his place I am thinking about all these women who've been in his bed, etc.

Well, don't do that then?

&gt; He told me he enjoys living his single life and how he enjoyed sleeping around.

Unsurprising.  Most people enjoy the things they do.  You don't sleep with 30 women because the first 29 were horribly unpleasant; you sleep with 30 women because sleeping with women is fun.  (Newsflash:  It totally is, by the way.)

&gt; I was really hurt.

Last night my SO told me she likes peas.  I was really hurt!  Sound silly?  That's because it is.  It might rightly disgust me to think of her chewing a mouthful of peas, but it's not something that should *hurt* me.  Hurtful things are things your SO does to hurt you.  Eating peas in front of me might be hurtful; having eaten peas in the past is not.  See the point?

&gt; WHAT DO YOU EXPECT

Well, what *did* you expect?

&gt; I need to find myself a virgin, if that's what I want

If the idea of your SO with other women ""hurts"" you then yeah, you clearly do.  Or is it something else?  What *do* you want?

&gt;  all guys like that?

Not all guys are ""like"" anything.  Some of us are asexual, some are gay, some have low sex drives, some have high sex drives, some have experimented a lot, some are virgins.  You get all sorts.

&gt; Sleeping around when Single 

...but yes, most guys (and girls) sleep around when single.  It's the 21st century.

&gt; no need for emotional connection when having sex??

Much like women, some have a high need for emotional connection, some have no need.  Some love having the emotional connection but *also* like casual sex.  Again, there's all sorts.  But I have to ask, what makes you think your partner has ""no need for emotional connection when having sex""?  Nothing you've said makes that clear; his partner count certainly doesn't.  30 women, 9 relationships?  Like he said, he's 32.

&gt;  I feel like, I thought he was a different guy, and I was blind and naive for thinking he wasn't like that.

Wasn't like **what**?  You've not managed to actually articulate what your problem is.  Is it that he (apparently) likes casual sex?  Good luck finding a guy who doesn't (or hell, a woman, although they facea lot more pressure not to excercise those urges).  Or is it that you think that he *only* likes casual sex?  Nine relationships sure makes it sound like you're wrong there.

If you're going to take this any further than ""this makes me uncomfortable"" you need to figure out what you actually want, and why this is bothering you, because you don't seem to have done that yet.  You keep veering between focusing on the numbers (which is mostly a function of opportunity) and his personality.  Which is it?  Are you simply upset that he's banged 30+ girls, but would be fine with being with a guy who desperately wants to but hasn't had the opportunity?  Or do you not care about the girls, but *do* care about being with a guy who'd want to do that?  And if the latter, what do you think this implies about his mindset, because I have a feeling you're reading a lot more into it than is justified.

TL;DR:  Don't focus on the numbers.  If you can't help focusing on the numbers, then...what do you think his numbers mean, and why is it bothering you?"

Honestly, I think you should break up with her. Not because of the lack of sex. But because: 1. You can't trust her to take care of her health; 2. She refuses to take responsibility for fixing something that is HER problem; 3. She won't communicate with you; 4. She doesn't care about your needs enough to put any effort into fixing this issue.

Definition:

* *un·du·late*: move with a smooth wavelike motion.

Daily undulating periodization is a form of planning that occurs over the weekly level. The idea is that by alternating the emphasis between volume accumulation and intensification every few weeks, you prevent the body from stagnating and falling into a rut.

* Accumulation is simply high-volume training – higher reps, more sets, more exercises, and so on. 

* Intensification is a focus on heavier weights, lower reps, and an emphasis on pushing up your working weights.

*Daily undulating periodization* rotates between different workouts over a weekly cycle.

i.e. You might pick three or four different workouts and rotate them across a set schedule. So if you only want to lift Mon-Weds-Fri, and you have workouts A, B, C, and D.

You might do A-B-C, then D-A-B, then C-D-A, and so on. It’s a repeating cycle.

Drunken_Black_Belt,AskMen,1389101701.0,"I worked security for years, and have had several confrontations with people.  Some general tips, especially for social situations, is to first and foremost try and diffuse the situation. 

The main tip I can give, and the one that has served me most in my years, is this simple phrase.  If someone is threatening to hit you, kick you ass, whatever, just reply, as calmly and non chalantly as possible ""Make a decision about what you want to do, and we will go from there...""  Not once, in my years of dealing with shoplifters, criminals, or even junkies trying to escape rehab, have I ever had anyone do anything after saying this to them.  It shows confidence that whatever they decide, I know I'll end up on top and it will make them think twice before doing anything.  But just incase that doesnt work, here are some other tips.

Find out what the issue is and address it.

  Don't gesture agressively, but make sure you speak with your hands so that they are at the ready up near your face in case you need to defense yourself.  

Don't face someone straight on. This gives you an added benefit of being better set up for an attack, and also appearing more relaxed.    And if they are staring you in the eyes, this is a good sign.  It's an intimidation tactic, and rarely means a physical attack is coming. What you want to watch for is their eyes making a quick, darting glance at another place on your person.  This is a ""Target glance""  and means they are looking where they are about to strike.  

And if you do get into a physical confrontation, and know help isn't immediatly available, here are the two best tips I can give you.  1.) Go for the gut/liver.  Most people aren't in fighting shape.  Even people who are in shape, aren't in fighting shape.  They don't know how to breath proprely during combat, and aren't used to the pace of a fight.  So go for the gut and liver area.  Most people will quickly get low on oxygen and have high lactic acid being produced, so a good shot to the liver is going to be more effective than punching someone in the face. Because  2.) punching someone in the face can seriously hurt your hand, possibly break it.  If you do for a face punch, use the palm of your hand rather than a close fist.  Also, target the T zone of the face.  If you aren't used to being hit, you're breathing will be interrupted with each strike.  So you'll run out of breath quicker if you aren't trained.  Plus the bodies natural reaction to being struck around the nose and eyes is to make the eyes water, reducing visibility.

Don't go looking for the spectacular knock out punch, because it probably won't happen.  You'll throw fist around until someone (a bouncer perhaps) breaks it up.  The goal is to survive and not be on the wrong end of an ass whooping.  Trying to play Chuck Lidell and knock someone out isn't going to work unless you're trained or lucky

"
balathustrius,mead,1389101701.0,"I like to add fruit half up-front and half at the tail end of fermentation. I think the flavors come through better. Vigorous fermentation - and EC-1118 will be vigorous - can blow off those wonderful raspberry aromas. Though with one gallon batches I've been known to chuck it all in at the start because I can't be bothered.

Pectic enzyme is inhibited by the presence of alcohol. If you want to use it, use it at pitch.

4.5L is close to 1.2 gallons. 3 lbs of honey in a batch that size will put you at 12% alcohol, and with EC-1118, that will go *dry* unless you manage to cold crash it before that point.

The fruit will add some nutrients and nitrogen, but you still should probably supplement it with a nutrient blend like Fermaid-K.

If you're worried about bacteria on the fruit, you can mix up everything, but don't pitch the yeast right away. Add a crushed campden tablet, stir, and allow to sit 24 hours before pitching. That should stop anything riding on the berries. I don't do this for small batches, as odds are that a strong yeast pitch will out-compete absolutely everything.

I recommend bottling in crown cap bottles. 1 gallon fills about ten 12 oz beer bottles. That way you would carbonate 6 and leave 4 still."

TheLittleGoodWolf,sex,1389101707.0," It is said that men have a higher sex drive than women, I'm sure you can find studies that prove this statement to be both true and false. The thing is though that masturbation has been proven to be beneficial. It releases endorfins and other substances that make you feel good and calms you down. This is true for both sexes although your mileage may vary individually. 

You come across as very accusatory in your post, is this on purpose? There seems be some ulterior situation that drives it? Is this true, and if so what is the situation?

Any behavior can become addictive and it's only when it has become an addiction that it becomes truly troubling since the person has lost control. Watching porn can and is very stimulating to many people (including women) since it is a way to visualize (and more) certain fantasies that could otherwise never be experienced. It's the same as with normal movies or books or videogames, what differs is the medium. An addiction to porn is realized when the person is injuring him or herself and fails to realize it. Just like with addiction to alcohol, cigarettes or other drugs. Drinking alcohol can be far more addictive and destructive than watching porn yet it is socially accepted to do that as well, hell it's even encouraged.
One can even become addicted to sex itself and sex is considered vital to the survival of the species.

Think of porn as an aid to arousal, consider why there are numerous variations of sex toys for women and how there are virtually none for men. The oldest known dildo is said to be about 30,000 years old for example. My theory is that porn is the sex toy for men, it's a way to sexually stimulate the brain with visual media. And while doing this a man will naturally stimulate himself physically as well. If there isn't a woman around who is willing and available to sexually stimulate him why not take care of it in another way.

The best way to incorporate porn into a couple is to talk about it, share ones views on the matter and realize that much like the dildo it's supposed to be an aid not a substitute."
EOverM,worldbuilding,1389101717.0,"That's the plan.  I've built a world that could be as diverse as the Discworld if I do it right, so there ought to be endless possibilities."
PatHeist,worldnews,1389101725.0,"I would put it under 'marijuana related deaths', like 'alcohol related deaths'. Which encompasses, in the wider sense, any death where the drug could be deemed to influence people in such a way that death occurred where it would be improbable to have otherwise. A bar fight where participants are very drunk leading to fatalities could be attributed to alcohol, and a car crash where the driver was high could be attributed to marijuana. 

You do get more isolated situations where the individual in question was merely less able to respond to their surroundings and events out of their control because of intoxication, though. Like a drunk driver being unable to properly react to a large animal on the road because of their mental state at the moment. That's where you get into the issue of judging where it would be reasonable to conclude if death would or wouldn't have occurred if the individual wasn't intoxicated, though. And it's also where it's nearly always written off as a 'drug related death' by the police or relevant authorities without much thought to the situation.

But the bottom line is, regardless of things like these being difficult to analyze and measure, being intoxicated when in situations that require a degree of mental clarity doesn't tend to improve your chances of survival. And we should probably keep recreational drug use of any kind to safe situations where we know we don't need to be clear of mind for the next few hours."

tomanonimos,legaladvice,1389101801.0,"Since you have HR I will assume you work for a private company with more than 50 employees and fit the FMLA requirement. 

You are entitled to 12 weeks of leave in a 2 year span for the baby. You and your wife working in the same company is irrelevant, you two are separate employees entitled to the same benefits. The law is pretty clear when it says employee as a singular entity. Your HR can lie to you but they cannot legally stop either of you. Remember to think of your wife and you as individuals under a company not a couple under the company. 

Now, I personally feel, you should receive the HR statement as a lie and a warning. This might leave a bad mark on your record which could damage you in the future, and nothing is stopping a company from denying you a promotion for this. If you both work in the same department than the HR statement is a greater warning because economically speaking an employer is losing double the production with you two gone. 

TL;DR After reading NJ FMLA; it restricts an employer from dictating an individual employee's FMLA if that employee meets the requirements. I feel you should look at your situation before going against HR's ""warning"".

P.S. The only thing I can find where an employer can dictate your FMLA is if you take intermittently.   "

But you can stall that. In lane, he is strong too, but there are standard tactics that work against him: stay close to minions, you don't want to eat an isolated Q. 
Also, as for specific champions, you need to be beefy and trade at the same time. Or have insane burst. Beefy champions are more of the standard ones: Renekton, Garen, Darius come to my mind. Maybe even more tank oriented champs like Malph or shyvana.

Now my favorite:
I played against Kha Zix as Yasuo. You can outtrade him up until lvl 3. You have a shield that eats about a whole Q for you. You can block his W with wind wall if timed correctly. You can spam Q harder than he can, you can escape with dash when he jumps for you. In my opinions, Yasuo works fine against Kha Zix. You don't even need sustain (lifesteal) because you will not poke or trade for long/often. Chunk him a bit with your Q, stack your Q, Ult, Ignite and the job should be done."

I tend to go quiet and get an urge to self harm when I'm stressed out now, and I've been doing that with my SO recently and he has been so worried about me feeling like I can't talk to him. This at least gives me a way to show him that my anxiety is related only to a learned coping mechanism which was ingrained much longer than our current relationship has even existed.

SirNuke,OutOfTheLoop,1389102403.0,"While that's possible, and the timing is convenient, I think that's highly unlikely.  A&amp;E certainly didn't say ""hey Phil, go sound your mouth off to GQ a month before the next season to drum up controversy!"" 

Companies don't like getting caught up in these sort of rifts. It's terribly difficult to predict how everything is going to go down, and there's a lot of ways it could have ended badly for A&amp;E.  I think it's worth noting that hardly anyone defended [Tim Hardaway Sr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway) when he sounded off a few years ago.  Controversy, yes, but nothing equated with him say any benefit either.

What would the outcome be if emails saying ""this'll be great for business!"" had been leaked?  What if he hadn't mentioned religion and no one came to his defense?  What if he had gone further and it'd been hard to keep him and advertisers on board?  What if the family collectively decided that the suspension was too big of an insult and they didn't really need the show?  What if the Internet collectively said ""meh"" to all of it, so A&amp;E strained their relationship with Robertson for no benefit?

The show doesn't exactly need a lot of hype, so why take the risk of everything backfiring?

I think the suspension was likely to reassure advertisers, perhaps to deflect any controversy away from them and onto A&amp;E.  A&amp;E probably hopes the slap on the wrist is enough for Robertson to keep his mouth shut in the future.

EDIT: I will also disagree that Duck Dynasty's viewership is /r/forwardsfromgrandma personified.  There's plenty of very smart, very liberal people who watch low quality TV shows.  GQ's readership is hardly good ole southern country boys, but the magazine still though their readers would enjoy an interview with Robertson."

CARFAX Advisor™
A NAM title is issued when the owner discloses to a DMV mileage fraud, a broken odometer or that the actual mileage of this vehicle is unknown.

Mileage reported after this reading is potentially unreliable. 

Reading between the lines it looks like someone guessed when they put down mileage for title work, and guessed wrong- all the mileage readings after this point look legit.

Greggor88,funny,1389102431.0,"I did read the sources before making my post. However...

* ""[Most"" spiders have four pairs of eyes.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Eyes)

* Their source admits that spider silk comes from spinnerets.

* Their source states ""Male-male courtship display has been observed in several spiders in the families Salticidae and Lycosidae."" The fact is that those spiders often can't tell the difference between males and females and mate indiscriminately. This is a far cry from saying ""spiders are gay"". If that were the case, they would be extinct.

* An average of 250 spiders are found during a human autopsy, living in the endocrine system. **This one and the next one are linked**

* Spiders and Milk Production. &lt;--- Their source for this fact AND the previous one is a ""spider facts"" webpage. [I'll link it here](http://www.hamtwoslices.net/spiders.htm). Go ahead and read some of those facts. The whole webpage is satire. I'm going to list some of the funnier ones.

1. Did you know that those **spiders** with hair on them **are mammals**, and thus produce delicious (and unusually cold) milk. Spiders produce milk using the same glands that they produce silk threads with.

2. That's easy - while spiders are usually known for their webs, they can also weave wind-sailing ""parachutes"" capable of taking them high above the world below. Furthermore, the so-called WindCurrent Spiders have actually evolved to live without a verticle base - they have lived for hundreds of millenia within the Earths ionosphere. The WindCurrent Spider is cannabilistic, it also **retrieves many of its nutrients from** sunlight, via a process not unsimilar to **photosynthesis**.

3. The largest spider ever observed by scientists was over 8 feet long and weighed in at 530 pounds. It was actually immobile though, it's legs had been broken long ago by merely carrying its own weight

4. The average human autopsy procedure in Chicago, IL will reveal roughly 250 small spiders living at points throughout the endocrine and circulatory systems. In New York, NY the average is upwards of 800.

5. In conventional psychology the most dangerous concept in dream understanding is the spider - it represents to the human subconscious the eleven stages of grieving (eight legs, torso, two antannae). *Note from me: Spiders do not have antennae.*

6. Harvard Neurologists have discovered that an average spider's brain possesses a greater mental capacity than the world's most brilliant scientists. If their brains didn't lack a cognitive lobe, they'd be more intelligent than Einstein

7. Did you know that spiders are almost all homosexual? Their species evolved to be that way as a form of population control. That's why there are so many male spiders and so few female. And that's also why the queen kills the male after mating with it, because she views him as a genetic anomaly *Seems legit...*

8. The United States government spends over four percent of its GDP on methods to eliminate spiders - that's more than the war on terror, the war on drugs and the national parks program combined!

9. The Black Widow spider's name derives from its penchant for killing husbands of mix-race marriages; to this day, they remain the only type of spiders ever specifically demonished for racism by both the United States Congress and the British House of Lords. **My personal favorite**.

EDITED: to fix a dumbass mistake where I used ""instinct"" instead of ""extinct""."

Why not start small - try watching tv with her, or maybe introduce her to a show you think she'll enjoy, or watch a movie. Do you have an allowance or job? If so, you could treat her to an evening out at the cinema and buy the popcorn. This would still be within her comfort zone, so she'd probably go for it.

Where do you guys live? How about suggesting a daytrip somewhere cheap and close, you could go for a nice walk &amp; then get lunch or dinner. For example, if you live by the coast then you could go for a beachfront or coastal walk, then get some local food such as fish &amp; chips or street food like donuts or whatever. If you live somewhere rural, you could go for a walk in the woods or countryside.

You could try to help her more around the house, or persuade her to skips a day and do something fun with you. Even if it's just going out into the garden with some tea and cake, or going to a farmer's market together.

Stuff me and my dad (52) enjoy (for a more balanced, opposite sex thing): bikerides, going on country walks, going somewhere cool and taking photographs or sketching, looking for wildlife e.g. birdwatching or seawatching, cooking, gardening, going to art galleries or exhibition parks.

Hythy,AskAnthropology,1389102730.0,"I think the problem with your post is that you've thrown in two terms that're hardly flattering and then claimed you're not making an attack. If you really want an answer from people maybe you could ask something along the lines of ""Why is anthropology so often inaccessible to non-anthropologists? Do you believe this is intentional? Do you believe this is an issue with the field? If it is an issue, how do you think it could best be resolved?"" (a lot of quick fire questions, I know, but I'm trying to get the gist of what you're saying).

Personally, as someone who has studied both Social Anthropology and Continental Philosophy I can only suggest that my experience with the analytic tradition can be equally perplexing, and Truth-functional propositional logic, written as a formula is hardly accessible to the average joe.

As far as Anthropology goes, it is a very self referential field, and so some ""pretentious"" jargon might actually be a very specific use of the term that is referring to the work of a previous writer or someone in a wholly different field. As a result you tend to end up with a patchwork of terminology that is constantly being reevaluated and negotiated within the discipline.

Honestly when you ask a women what she looks for in a man, she basically says ""nice, kind, funny"" etc but what she is really doing is taking a (hypothetical) guy she is already attracted to and giving him traits she wants him to have. The problem is that she hasn't even answered the question, she hasn't said what built that attraction in the first place (clue: it isn't being nice or kind)

It gets even worse when you look at how badly women tend to rationalise things. I can see when a person is a good person and when he is a bad person. All the time I see women massively coming out with stupid reasons why a man who is by all accounts abusive and horrible is really good and why decent guys to whom they have no attraction are actually awful people (""HURR NICE GUYS ARE MANIPULATIVE"" etc). I'll be honest men do the same albeit to a lesser degree, for example men tell women that they look better natural i.e. without make-up, but really they are talking about a very beautiful girl in their mind who doesn't need make-up to begin with."

I ended up catching him a couple of times and it led to several discussions - open, honest, not too judgmental. He realized that it was impacting our relationship and adjusted his activities so that we haven had an issue since.

wufoo2,sex,1389103191.0,"I would doubt that doctor's advice. The glans and inner foreskin are membrane, not skin. Many American doctors don't understand this. We don't use soap on any of our other membranes. 

I have an idea that might help, based on my own experience. And it doesn't involve permanent loss of your foreskin.

I used to soap and wash my glans and inner foreskin daily, thinking I'd be more presentable to a potential sex partner. But what I ended up with was a shrunken foreskin that no longer closed at the end; a hypersensitive glans that didn't like being touched; and a bad-smelling penis. (The last one because a dehydrated glans and inner foreskin absorb urine, rather than repel it.)

Somewhere I learned that the inner foreskin and glans are mucosa, not skin. Soap has no business there, anymore than inside our eyelids or nostrils. And the inner foreskin is [self-cleaning](http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/inspect.htm), again like the eyelids, so regular, deliberate washing actually does more harm than good by stripping away the natural substances.

So I started by eliminating soap and after a wash, not drying the glans before closing the foreskin. I started seeing more of my foreskin then, and if I went a few days with no washing at all, it got even longer and more pliable. As long as I rinsed before oral sex, my wife was fine with that.

Then, because I didn't make enough smegma to recover from nighttime erections and even weekly rinsings, I would add a thin layer of pure aloe gel to the glans before closing, and leave it there. I immediately got a much longer foreskin and the return of the ""pucker"" I hadn't seen since puberty.

But the surprise benefit was normalized sensitivity. My glans no longer made me jump when touched. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but a moist glans seems to handle contact better than a dehydrated one. Maybe it's because a dry glans within a foreskin can't form the [keratinization](http://www.stopthecut.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/12336060979711.jpg) (NSFW) that protects circumcised guys from friction. So it's an uncomfortable middle.

Anyway, now my sensitivity is just fine. My wife can even do something that would have had me howling before: after my glans has dried a bit in the open air, she can administer a ""dry rub"" with her fingers to the glans and whole inner foreskin, sliding loosely and rapidly from top to bottom and back. It feels so good it makes my eyes flutter. She also prefers the softness and suppleness my foreskin has now.

I hope this is useful to you. It won't cost you anything (aside from a bottle of pure aloe gel, perhaps) and if it doesn't work you can always try something else."

injoy,Reformed,1389103255.0,"Okay, there are quite a few comments here equating Arminianism with ignorance, and, I don't think that's entirely fair.  Arminianism is an error, true.  And it is an error that anybody who doesn't believe in God is going to fall into to some extent--it's what Satan wants the world to think, that there isn't a sovereign God.  That doesn't mean that people who are Arminian just don't care about theology.  There are lots of God-loving Arminians out there who love the Bible and read it and study it and tell all their friends about Jesus with boldness and passion, who believe God is sovereign.

But they are taught wrongly from the cradle.  And the Presbyterians aren't very evangelistic to the free-will Baptists, in my experience.  I was so shocked and offended when I found out that Reformed theology *existed* that none of my (Bible-believing!) Presbyterian friends had ever thought to tell me about the doctrines of grace.  WHY?  We go to a church (OPC) now that I had many friends from.  My Baptist pastors and Bible teachers were telling me with complete certainty that my questions about ""election"" in the Bible were dangerous and heretical. And in the pre-internet world, it was hard to find anyone who believed any differently.  And all my Presbyterian friends never once told me differently.  But when Reformed theology did start to invade our little corner of the world (by the internet!), we KNEW it was true.  It was what we had always wanted to believe but never dared.  Suddenly what we were told were ""paradoxes"" made sense.  It all made sense.  I am not the only one who has had this experience."
TLKPartyPanda36,AskMen,1389103260.0,"Well it wasn't the sex that was bad. She was just crazy and I never fully realized it at the time.

One thing lead to another and we ended up having sex.  She had done it before however I never knew what happened [to the guy] after. She wouldn't leave me alone, saying that she loved me and everything like that.  Kept texting and calling.  Looking back on that, I can completely see why it happened like it did, she wasn't supposed to do that before marriage and she felt like marrying me/saying she loved me would be her safe haven.  I felt like a dick for a while afterwards, but it was as much me initiating it as she did. So I can't really be super hard on myself in that respect.

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1389103286.0,"This was a very interesting title, so I decided to look into it. 

First off, the number ""32"" comes from this sentence in the article:

&gt; In case you're wondering, that's approximately 32 deaths by lightning strike.

That is an upperbound bias estimate which ranges from 9 to 32. That's fine if we assume the FBI were being generous/liberal, as the author did.

Secondly, more disconcertingly, the author repeatedly compares annual stats (from year 2012) with lifetime stats. Even then, the calculations look off. He'd have to explain where he gets this from:

&gt; In other words, men are **27,500x** more likely to be raped than falsely accused of rape.

even if we forgave the fact that he's comparing one year (2012) vs a lifetime stat.

The same goes for the lightning strike comparison, in which we have a similar flaw. He's comparing the chance of dying in a particular way to change of being falsely accused of rape within a single year. This only makes sense if we presume with certainty that you're among the ones who will certainly die in the given year.

In 2010, the number of deaths was reported 2,468,435. If that 1/84,079  was applicable to 2010, we'd multiple that ratio by number of deaths, and get the total number of lightning deaths in 2010, divide it by the 2010 population to get the absolute probability of someone dying from lightning in 2010.

No need to go that far, since we actually have an absolute number given for 2010. [In 2010, there were 29 deaths from lightning](http://www.nws.noaa.gov/os/hazstats/light10.pdf). You divide that by the total US pop in 2010 ([308,745,538](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_States_Census)) and get the much more recognizable ratio of approx 1 in 10 million (I rounded up).

Not 1 in 84k.

Now, this is a 2010 stat, not a 2012, but we can still appreciate the fact that there are a few orders of magnitude in difference when we're counting ""chance of being killed by lightning in a single year"" vs ""chance of having been killed by lightning in a given year if you are dead"".

Finally, this is on top of the fact that he'd still be comparing total lightning deaths vs a specific subset of the population targeted for false rape claims (he limits that to 15-39 year old males). If we did the same for the lightning deaths statistic, we'd get significantly lower ratio than 1 in 10 million.

I'm not saying that the ""false rape"" concern isn't inflated by some MRAs, but poorly-thought stats and analogies combined with lack of willingness to contest them does not help anyone's argument. A cursory glance at author's profile tells me he should work a bit on his credibility in other areas as well."

Tavarish,thedivision,1389103367.0,"What was wrong with my OP? :(

That asked I quote myself from /r/games thread.

**Q1;**

&gt;We really don't know when Massive started development of Snowdrop [theirs engine] so it's hard to say how short or long cycle has been this far. I would argue that it has nothing to do with new über tech of current gen, but just the fact that engine development takes a lot time.

&gt;Massive even has little bit hinted that E3 demo was barely in working state and they had coders at backstage just in case it would blow in theirs faces. That coupled with this rumor that engine is now up and running suggests, to me, Ubisoft is assuming that Massive can deliver game in less than 12 months of development.

&gt;Personally I don't mind if they have to delay into 2015 because 2014 will have great games anyways and delay would mean more polished product.

**Q2;**

&gt;I would argue that studio like Massive is comfortable with current-gen because they share baseline x86-architecture with PC's and Massive has been PC studio. I'm not saying other developers aren't familiar with PC space, but studios that have been PC exclusive most likely will have some edge.

&gt;What may have caused delays and issues with tech development for e.g. Massive is how Sony &amp; MS kept changing specs and basic How console will work -plans until very last minute. DICE has little bit talked about how sudden changes kept throwing them back to drawing board with FB 3 and Bf 4.

&gt;In the end, if we were to believe rumor as fact, Snowdrop took longer to get up and running as intended than Massive expected and Ubisoft jumped the gun with release window announcement.

&gt;That all said I find this quote little bit funny, from article;

&gt;*The game engine works well, it is not clear but works well.*

&gt;Does it mean that engine works well, but they aren't 100% sure why it works well or that engine works well, but because of possible rush there is slight mess in code, but it still manages to work?

&gt;Hopefully neither because look at e.g. FB 3 which is, lets be honest here, mess and DICE is struggling to get it sorted out."
thepapacy,MMA,1389103370.0,"Nice post. With that said, i think if Bellator was feeling brave they'd do this (after negotiation) because a successful result would further their cause in the eyes of the culture and put more weight behind the pressure applied to Zuffa over their avoiding co-promotion. I suspect they wont since Viacom won't want to gamble on the risk of a disastrous showing. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, particularly the success or failure of WSOF since it seems to be a stalking horse for the UFC in their war on Bellator. 

Personally, i'm hoping the fighters will organize and form a co-operative business promotion so they can empower themselves to throw away their ""bosses"" who take most of the value they've created and keep it for themselves. 


Edit: look how similar the WSOF logo is to the UFC's in their press release in the challenge:

https://twitter.com/MMAWorldSeries/status/420257128620646400

Could be an attempt at branding collusion to have people associate them with the UFC on a gut level. Businesses get sued for stuff like this, so it's interesting how this could be another action from a ""competitor"" that the UFC is silent about since they're so aggressive with all the other competitors they've had in the past.

See this is where the SJW's stumble. They can totally see themselves as Daisy Fitzroy, and don't get why people think that her actions are deplorable.

clairebones,TwoXChromosomes,1389103586.0,"A lot of older generations seems to, in my experience associate drinking alone with alcoholism. They aren't worried so much about how much you're drinking but they see you drinking by yourself and their minds jump to alcoholism, because perhaps in their minds if you're willing to drink alone it's because you 'need' it rather than as a social activity. This is, at least in my area, often a habit associated with alcoholism and alcohol is still seen as a social drink.

You mentioned their experience with alcoholics, my grandad and uncle are recovering alcoholics so my dad was always a bit cautious with us, particularly with vodka because as he said, every alcohol he knew drank vodka as their first choice. So is it possible that cider is that 'trigger' rink for them?

I'd suggest sitting some evening and saying that you appreciate their concern, you'd like to know why they are worried so you can help calm their fears. It's possible you may have to try not drinking alone at home if that is the thing that concerns them.

pinkfloydchick64,AskReddit,1389103595.0,"I'm sorry to hear about what you're going through. I'm no expert, but my suggestion would be to give her the space she needs. As cliche as it sounds, the phrase ""if you love something, let it go"" holds true in this case. If she really loves you, she'll be able to figure that out through the muck. I think that if you're pushy, she'll think you're controlling and she might grow to resent you. 

At the same time, don't let this relationship decide your life. If she is indecisive for an unacceptable period of time, you need to realize that you deserve someone who fully loves you. You're young and able to find someone who is as infatuated with you as you are with them. A tough pill to swallow, but it's true.

Good luck in this situation, however you decide to proceed, and if you ever need to talk shoot me a PM!"

miked4o7,Games,1389103678.0,"1-3)  I don't see any of these hurdles as insurmountable.  If you take any of the first three as being obstacles that absolutely can't be overcome, then you'd have to just say there can never ever be a new player in the console space, ever... which I think is just not true.


4-5) The Steam Machine is already getting attention, and Valve has managed to grow some pretty huge things without marketing before.  Not to mention I'm sure some of these OEMs will be doing their own marketing.


6) There might be a large segment of the buildapc crowd *might* never get into it, but I've built my last 4 PCs and I'm interested.  A couple of those machines look overpriced for their components, but a couple others actually look very reasonable.  If a reasonably priced machine is available in the spec range I want, I'd get it.  I can barely make my wiring in large towers not look like a complete nightmare, so I'd like to have professionals build out a machine with a small form factor like lots of these for me if it comes down to it.


7)  The consoles have specific parts in them too.  Some people care and want to know what they are, some people don't.  If reviews are coming out saying things like ""The Alienware Steam Machine runs this game at 1080p with a solid 60fps, compared to the XBOne 30fps"", then that's the only kind of thing general consumers really need to know."
Dookiet,Libertarian,1389103680.0,"Socialism as you say requires ""workers to owning and operating the means of production,"" and how is this accomplished? It's not as if large companies are create by workers coming together and forming a corporation. This is why socialism is a means of political organization. Either the state must create, or take through violence (more often the case sadly) the means of production, and this is why socialism requires perfect people.  Now listen kiddo, I know you seem to think that everyone loves their neighbor and world peace is possible if we all just love enough, but not being 14 anymore I know better. Now you have stated that I have a terrible view of my fellow man, but your just naive. I truly think people are good, and but political and ""economic"" systems that give certain people control (including most modern capitalist economies) which leads inevitably to corruption. Capitalism doesn't ""do it for the profit of capitalists"" it does it for the profit of all, no one holds a gun to your head and says work, or buy this brand of phone (that's what we have socialism, and communism for) companies and capitalist make money selling people shit they want. How fucking dare they make money for making something for me, or doing something I need. Profit is not a dirty word, despite what reddit thinks, if you or I raise crops our labor leads to a profit of crops, just as we are now paid for our work. We profit by our labor or intellect, as companies profit by producing goods and services we want so by definition you can't have people making money ""whether or not consumers are served"" that only happens to socialist and communist leaders"

Tall-dude,short,1389103796.0,"My guess is that the reason that short people are the cause of most of the trouble is that they feel the need to assert themselves through violent means. 

Us all people are a lot more calm for a variety of reasons.

If we get into a fight, we are usually blamed/held responsible(especially if it was against one of the aforementioned short individuals). This significantly dampers the willingness to fight.

Tall(and regular sized individuals) usually feel a lot more comfortable/secure about themselves than short individuals. Therefore it usually takes a lot more to trigger our fight instinct. 

If the police manual lists this (admittedly rather anecdotal) evidence there must be a reason for it. If short people weren't statistically more likely to cause any trouble, why would the police manual single them out? 

Actually, it's not a power game, and I am not out to protect my social power. Also, social power is NOT a zero sum game, mostly due to the fact that social power isn't one thing. I'm the expert at some things in my social group and fill a certain role/function. When those areas are needed I have a lot of power. Other times, I might as well be the fly on the wall. I'm fine with that, simply because I don't need the validation of others to know that I'm a valuable human being and deserving of(at the very least) a rather large portion of self respect, even if other's don't give a shit about me. 

Personally, I think all people should be given the same rights and responsibilities. However, if they squander these rights by behaving in an unwanted way, then I see no problem with revoking these rights(aka social powers)"

Because you have to cater to the ""dumb"" (non-gifted) kids who drag down the scores and therefore ""ruin"" the schools image for the federal government and grants.  When teaching, if your goal is to get the highest standardized test scores, you have to cater to the ""dumber"" kids.  The naturally gifted students will always perform well with minimal teacher involvement, forcing teachers to focus on the non-gifted and set the course to their level.

123_Meatsauce,AskReddit,1389104060.0,"I suffer from anxiety. I have learned how to control it by attacking it face on. Concentrate on your fears and analyze them: understand why they are there and if they are rational fears or not. the key is you MUST have an open mind and be realistic, you have to believe yourself. Your brain is a powerful thing, and your body will do whatever it is told, keep that in mind.  

This is an example of how I would analyze:
Why am I scared of airplane ride?
-Because I could crash
-Because I dont like it when they shake
-I dont want to die

Are these fears rational? 
(Crash) Well, hundreds of thousands of planes fly every day and I almost never hear of a major crash.... so this doesn't seem likely that mine is going to crash.. My family and friends all fly every now and then, they never crash. I could crash, but there is a VERY low risk. I even read once that you are more likely to get struck by lightening than crash, have I ever got struck by lightening? It doesn't seem likely that I would crash...

Now tell yourself and believe that you are not going to crash because it isn't likely  (which it isn't)

This is what works for me. You can apply this to other fears or phobias as well. Hope this helps. "

On a DAILY basis. They taught me that my feelings and reactions were invalid - it hurt especially coming from my stepdad because my dad left when I was really young. I thought all men would have the same opinion of me -- and either leave or ""put up with me"". My mom would barely let me leave the house to spend time with friends. If there was a SHIRT on my bedroom floor not picked up I would be screamed at until she wanted to stop. My parents did all of this. I completely lost my voice.

Men and women are not fighting the right fight to stay married and fixing the problems they have for the sake of a healthier upbringing for the kids. They are running away and separating because they think it will give their children a better home. I agree.

BUT your statement that WOMEN are the ones that cause much more damage to the children by bringing the men they might date around the children is wrong. Men do it too. Women have the same insecurities about marriage and having children that men do.

I'm going through my own separation issues and trying my damnedest to keep my family together and prevent my son from experiencing other women that my husband has affairs with. 

I like the article but I don't think an 'open' marriage is a smart thing to suggest when you're also suggesting the parents stay together. Either stay together and work out your problems and trust issues or run and cower like all the other Americans now and get stuck in the perpetual cycle of disgusting dating and insecurities. "

ankylosaurus_rex,ABraThatFits,1389104718.0,"It's not harmful to your health exactly, but think of it more as counter-productive.  If your wires are too narrow, that means some of your breast tissue is not in the cups.  And that means that your wires are actually pushing some of your breast tissue *away* from your breasts.

This is also the reason why they say not to wear underwired bras while you're breastfeeding - because most people wear too small of bras/wires, so the wires are sitting directly on breast tissue.  Which inhibits the flow of milk (or so I've heard).  If you wear a bra with wires that *aren't* sitting on tissue, then there's no reason not to wear underwires when you're breastfeeding.

To sum up, it's better to have wires that are a bit too wide than wires that are a bit too small.

I imagine the military is much like having a child. It can be draining, exhausting, and even depriving of sleep. Once you have a child your life isn't ever the same and for the most part you have to consider your children first. Maybe after 18 years you can relax a bit, but it's always an aspect of your life. That doesn't mean you necessarily wish you never had children. It's worth the obstacles and exhaustion. Military life can be the same way. For me, it's worth the exhaustion. "

madhjsp,nfl,1389104875.0,"Considering that that was one of the great college football championships of the last few decades, I would certainly hope you enjoyed it!  

To add a bit more context (sorry if you already know all this): college football teams are divided into conferences not unlike NFL divisions, except that CFB conferences are much larger (usually 8-14 teams), have somewhat looser geographical boundaries, and are each run by their own governing bodies under the overall umbrella of the NCAA, meaning that schools are able to move between them (though this is a complicated process).  

Auburn University is a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC), the conference which had produced the last 7 national championship-winning teams. Florida State, from the Atlantic Coast Conference, not only ended this unprecedented streak, but also capped one of the most impressive seasons by a team in the history of modern college football. They went undefeated, never won by less than 14 points (until the championship), and their quarterback won the Heisman Trophy (college football's most prestigious individual award) as a redshirt freshman (meaning it was his first season playing college football - there had been no freshman Heisman winners in the history of college football until Johnny Manziel did it in 2012).   

Last night's game also marked the end of an era for college football, as in 2014 they will begin a new system of crowning a national champion; instead of a somewhat-arcane system of polls and computers selecting 2 teams to play in the championship game, a new selection committee will choose 4 teams to compete in a playoff, the first ever in the the history of *major-conference* college football.

plusoneeffpee,askscience,1389104883.0,"Because we didn't know what they were when they were discovered.

For example, IgG was first discovered electrophoeresis of human blood. There were three fractions, named alpha, beta, and gamma. A protein in the gamma fraction was found to be (1) globular and (2) have immunologic properties. It therefore became known as the ""gamma immunoglobulin."" They later found that there were other immunoglbulins in the other fractions. 

In fact, IgA was found (oddly enough) in the beta fraction....but the beta fraction has been resolved into several subfractions, one of which was beta-2A. It became truncated to IgA. So  in answer to your question ""why is there no IgB?"", there really is no good reason at all. By rights, IgA should have been called IgB. But then there would be no IgA....

Another guy was working on myeloma. THere was a protein he found in the blood from these patients that was similar to the previously discovered IgG but was much larger. It was dubbed ""macroglobulin"" and became known as IgM.

It gets worse. 

IgD was named that because (1) there already was an IgA. (2) People expected the mouse immunoglobulins would be called ""beta"" (3) there was no Greek equivalent of ""c"" (4) D! Yeah! D sounds good!

Science names can be arbitrary, and often are. Look at the CD proteins...there is *zero* rhyme or reason there. Just name them for their damned functions!

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1389104903.0,"I see what you're trying to say, and I'm not trying to be argumentative, but here are my thoughts:

First I just want to say, that as an adult woman, I have never actively sought out a partner who reminded me of my dad. I've never compared my dad to potential partners, other than over casual things like ""Oh you like Star Wars, my dad likes Star Wars, you'd probably get along"". I've never had a desire to recreate the father/daughter relationship with a sexual partner. Because that would be weird, to me. I don't believe that women, all women, have this deep down desire to be dominated and coddled. I was also never once told by my father that I was a ""princess"" who needed to be protected. My dad took me hunting, drove me to karate lessons and taught me how to play chess. 

Reality is more complicated than claiming ""People try to recreate the happy feelings of love they had with their parents, and since the mother/son and father/daughter dynamics are different, love between genders must be too"". I don't believe that romantic relationships are necessarily a desire to recreate positive childhood emotions. Now I'm not saying that there aren't societal influences behind people's behavior. Obviously, one's childhood is going to have an effect an the way they view the world. But I don't believe that mother/son and father/daughter relationships are all the same archetypical cookie-cutter scenarios for everyone. Not all men had a stereotypical relationship with their mother and not all men spend their dating years trying to find someone to bake them cookies and kiss their boo-boos. Also, I believe parental love and romantic love are very different. Parental love is born from obligation, because deep down at the core of the matter, parents are responsible for their children. To me, romantic love is different, harder, scarier, because your partner *doesn't* deep down have a genetic connection to you, didn't birth you, didn't create you, doesn't *owe* you anything, male or female. And that's dangerous. But that's what trust is all about. And sometimes that trust backfires. And that hurts and it sucks. But it's also part of life. You learn from the experience and move on.

In a way, I guess I *do* compare my male partners to my father, in that I want to be with someone who respects me, is into cool things and doesn't think I'm incapable of doing, understanding and feeling certain things because I'm female. I want to be with a decent human being, who will treat me like one back. But I learned that from both of my parents, not just my dad. 

In my opinion, traditional gender roles are the problem here. If we teach children that traditional gender roles are an ultimate truth, of course they will go out into the world expecting them. If men are taught that all women want to be treated like princesses and were raised by stereotypical overbearing protective fathers with a loaded shot-gun ready to defend her virtue with, then yes, it will affect their mentality when they pursue women. It seems like a popular sentiment of TRP is to degrade women who believe they are princesses and to de-pedestalize them, but who do you think raised those women? I've never understood why TRP seems to think that these princess-women raised in a traditionally feminine manner are somehow the result of feminism, and not of fathers (and mothers) who actively admit that they raise and treat their male and female children differently.

Accept that you'll do it in your own way in your own time and there's no metric for how ""over it"" anyone should be at any given time. My best friend's mum (who was a second mama to me) passed away almost a year ago and I still struggle with sadness sometimes. I usually channel it into remembering all of the amazing things she did for me (for reals, that woman pulled me out of hot water more times than I care to remember and ALWAYS knew when I was in a rough spot and would turn up with a lovely ""thinking of you"" type card or whatever - it was uncanny) and doing my best to emulate her in that way. I do the same when I miss my uncle who was one of my best friends - I remember how amazingly patient he was teaching me things like proper penmanship and diving from a fucking wheelchair with zero mobility below his neck and it reminds me to be more patient with those I love and that I have some power in helping them be the best thems.

I had a job as a gravedigger at a rural cemetery for a while and have seen the technicolor rainbow of emotions and coping strategies people will employ in grieving and place a lot of value in funeral ritual as a result of that combined with my own experiences in losing loved ones.

* Very specific near the end.

tjk911,Journalism,1389105314.0,"Everyone who responded here gave great points. I'd like to add a little, and hopefully you'll find something worthwhile there.  
  
I'm aspiring writer - and though my flair says ""reporter"" I'm more of a producer/developer. I work at a paper and I create snowfall-like packages, occasionally photography and videography. So, not much writing, though I am surrounded constantly by amazing writers. Which is nice, so I've that going for me.  
    
But the one invaluable thing I learned from my journo major and working in a newsroom is communication with people. Most journalists I know are inward-looking people, even though they have to constantly meet and interview people, and I've always been more of an introvert - it's just something I'm capable of channeling now (into my writing, coding etc).  
  
Communicating and networking is key in life, and I don't mean that in a strictly business sense. People have different styles of communication and journalism's forced me to read body language and adapt quickly to it.  
  
Being thrown out to interview numerous people about a subject they're an expert in, having to build rapport within a short amount of time, learning to cultivate relationships that are built on respect and trust - sometimes even when your contacts/sources don't ""like"" you.  
  
These are things that would have taken me much longer to learn outside of the journo-world/major. They're not exclusive to the field of course, but the major I had gave me that forced kickstart I needed. I went from the guy that had anxiety attacks picking up the phone, to a person that can chat people up these days.

lightfive,depression,1389105612.0,"I can totally understand where you come from, in fact, I thought you were describing me in your initial post.

Anyway, There is no ""meaning of life"". You have to figure out for yourself. I'm 17 now and believe me, I'm at a constant war with myself whether going to school and doing anything ""productive"" does make sense at all or not. Yet I believe that I can achieve something if I just keep on going. It probably won't be recognized by a lot of people, probably only by myself for that matter, but the more you think about life in general the more you understand how silly it actually is.

That said, just live it off, not in the YOLO way, not in the ""fuck it, I'm going to die anyway, let's just slack off"" way, but in the ""I can achieve something, I can do something, I can create something at which I'll look at the end of the day and be proud of"" way.

Do it! You sound extremely smart and this can be a burden at times, I know, but it's also a gift many won't be able to receive whatsoever.

""The more you know, the more you'll doubt"" - myself, right now.

Take these doubts and either make them disappear by proving them wrong and go on and find something to replace them with. You said it doesn't matter whether you cure cancer or just slack off and watch TV every day, but to be honest, it does matter. It does matter to all those who ever lost a relative, friend or person they loved to cancer, it does matter to those who suffer from any kind of a cancer and I guess it also matters to those who spent their whole life researching a possible cure.

You sound like a reasonable person to me. You sound fairly interested in science, so go and take your wisdom and share it with the world. This planet needs more people who think like you and less people who just stand by apathetically.

Sorry for the wall of text but I felt like you're going to through the same thing I am going through for the last three years.

All the best!

TL;DR: You can make a difference, you're smart and intelligent, so fcking do it! You have the power! Good luck! :-)"

LydiasBits,sex,1389105645.0,"I did until I talked to him and spent some time thinking about the subject. 

Based on what he was looking at, some of it seemed like he was looking for girls that looked like me or the younger me before we met. Some of it was different though. 

The key for me was telling him that I thought it was hurting our sex life together, that I don't want to be substituted with girls in porn, and that if he wanted to do something with me that he saw and thought I would have an issue with, he should talk to me about it and tell me honestly. 

Also, I told him I was fine if he wanted to watch porn some together. 

It took some time, much discussion and some creativity but we worked through it. 

Creativity included me asking him to lay off of porn AND masturbation for two weeks with the caveat that when he was horny he should tell me and we would do whatever we could given the time - sometimes full sex, sometimes a quickie, mutual masturbation, bj/hj, etc. that helped me understand better his level of sex drive. We ended up extending that to a month since he didn't travel at that point. 

Sometimes, I wasn't really in the mood but this was my idea do we went with it. 

It helped open up our communication a whole bunch. 

I am aware he still does masturbate, heck, I do too. I don't watch porn when I do it but I do fantasize beyond my hubby. I would never act on it. He uses porn for the same reason and I am comfortable that he wouldn't act on it either - part of our communication. 

We have a friend (M) who truly became addicted and it almost wrecked his marriage.
He ended up seeking counseling (couples and alone) and treated it as the addiction it had become. Fortunately, my hubby and I didn't think that my hubby's use if it approached that level. 

If it did, we would definitely seek help. 

If it is an issue with y'all, you must discuss it openly and honestly. He needs to understand that his relationship with you, if important to him, must be something where he needs to manage this issue in a way that makes you and him comfortable, happy, and full of trust.

Some guys may just go through an endless cycle from one category to the next always getting arroused by something new and different.  It is common to be turned on by whatever is different from normal, so it may by definition be the opposite of your SO.  This does not in any way mean you are not turned on by your SO.

agent_of_entropy,AskReddit,1389105957.0,$2k to an ex. 
Secretiveslave,sex,1389105962.0,"I don't really like teasing even a very playful context. Personally I prefer more assertive things like grabbing me talking dirty. Like my nickname suggests I'm into BDSM so a woman who's timid or trying be gentle and seductive doesn't turn me on nearly as much as one who grabs my shirt collar and leads me to the bedroom.

It he says things like ""it depends"" when you try to talk to him it could be a few things. He might not know yet? I get the impression that you guys are still pretty young so maybe he just hasn't had enough experience/exposure to find out what things really get him going. This kinda situation would be a chance for you to introduce things and see what gets him turned-on (like a science experiment). You could try dressing up, try spanking him, try getting him to spank you, etc. just have fun with it. Sex is supposed to be playful.

Another thing it could mean is that he has something he is into but isn't comfortable talking about. By showing him you're up for trying out lots of things he may feel more comfortable sharing it.

It could also mean that he's more conservative in bed and is afraid to put you off so he doesn't want to come out and say it. There are volumes that could be written about this but some indicators might be if you try something new and he starts getting judgmental like ""that's a slutty thing to do"" or ""only freaks do that"" then he might have some hangups or just not be into playful sex and it'll be hard (impossible if he doesn't want to) to work through them.

About the ""getting you off"" comment. There are some guys like, myself, who really do get most turned on by doing things to our partners and seeing them really enjoy it. The more turned on/vocal/orgasms my partner is/has the more it gets me going. There something about my partner being so turned on while I'm going down on her that she grabs my hair and pushes my face into her more that is a HUGE turn-on.

Hope this helps"

Srace,AlAnon,1389105968.0,"One of the frustrations that I had after I left my ex-husband was that I never felt like I had closure on his drinking and strange behaviour.  Because he was nice to everyone in public, and hid most of the problems, I was the only one who seemed to know about what an out of control person or what a crazy person he really was.  I was definitely the only one who saw the extent of the drinking as well.  Because of this, for years I felt like I was actually the crazy person.  I was also pretty convinced that I was the ""bad guy"" in the relationship because he could always find a way to blame me for judging him too much or not loving him enough.

The denial, covering up and isolation aspect of alcoholism is one of the most damaging aspects for someone living with an alcoholic.  I always had this vision that one day I would be able to articulate what had happened to me really clearly and get him to acknowledge and take responsibility for what had happened.  Years later, it still bugs me a little bit that I'm the only one who has actually done anything to ""deal"" with the alcoholism-related problems that affected our relationship from the very beginning.  

However, in Al-Anon, I have learned that my feelings are legitimate even if the other person tells me I am wrong to have them.  I have learned to respect my own feelings and ideas, and I have especially learned to try to act in ways that do not make me feel bad about myself.  When I take responsibility for my own feelings a bit more and look after myself as my first priority, I don't seem to feel as guilty or defensive when I make decisions in my own interest.

None of the things your boyfriend is doing are extraordinary.  All of them are quite typical for the actions of someone with a drinking problem.  As you will see in this forum, lots of alcoholics don't ever find sobriety.  If nothing were to change (and it may be quite unlikely that it will), is this the way that you would want to live your life?  

If you don't feel ready to answer this question right now, I encourage you to act in ways that make you feel good about yourself, and to see what you can do to get some support while you are in this difficult situation.  If you can, attend an Al-Anon meeting or an Open AA meeting.  Browse through previous posts on this forum as well.  You might even want to consider seeing a counsellor or therapist.  It's surprising how quickly someone else's addiction can start affecting us.

Hugs!!!  Look after yourself, OK?!  It's always worrying to those of us who have been there to see someone who is just getting into a similar situation.  Fundamentally, though, you have to figure out how you are going to react, and what you are comfortable doing.

TWEEVES,leagueoflegends,1389106001.0,"I'v played this game alot. I'v mained all the roles for long and short periods of time.

Back when I used to play WoW, before league was released I mained rouges. PvP was the best thing I knew. When I started playing League the translation was a little hard at first, not because the game was hard but because none of the champions suited me.

Lesbian_Drummer,sex,1389106712.0,"Um... I don't even know how to answer all of these.  As for the last one, though... you just let your partner watch porn and masturbate.  If it's not getting in the way of your sex life together, then I don't see the problem.

I say this as a woman with a higher sex drive than her partner.  My porn and masturbation habits are something my wife is possibly mildly amused by.  But I don't *prefer* masturbation.  If I had my way, I'd have sex with my wife at every chance.  But we don't have matching sex drives, and masturbating is one of the ways we make this work.  I can take the edge off and then leave her alone, which makes for a much happier marriage overall.  And we still have sex like once a week.  There have been ups and downs, but  they had more to do with me making her feel bad about not wanting to have sex than my masturbation habits getting in the way.

It probably helps that my wife was the one to introduce me to masturbating..."

xenonscreams,running,1389106752.0,"&gt; Also, it takes a lot of lifetime volume to really get to where your marathon times line up with shorter races. Most elite runners move to the marathon only after they've peaked in competition at every shorter distance.

I don't think this is true for everyone. My first marathon lined up perfectly with my half and I'd only been running for three years. I think the real problem with the marathon is that there's a lot of room to screw up, and if you do, you don't have a chance to try again for a while. 

The ""moving up"" thing is more about milking every distance IMO, since you peak earlier the shorter the distance. 

And I'd be really worried about going from zero workouts now to two within a few weeks. I'd do at least a season of just one workout a week before adding another. Jumping into quality so quickly is what got me hurt so much as a new runner. "

coveredinbeeees,Christianity,1389106780.0,"&gt;why would god allow it if women weren't responsible for it?

Why did God allow slavery in the US for hundreds of years? Why did the Holocaust happen? Was there some action that an African or Jew did that brought those tragedies upon their entire races? Or were those atrocities simply the result of a sinful world, and not a punishment for a individual sin?

This is a dangerous line of thinking.  The idea that women are somehow more responsible for the Fall is incredibly sexist in my opinion, and the implication that the ""magnitude of the subjugation that women had to go through in the history of mankind"" is somehow justified because of the actions of one woman is entirely contrary to Christian doctrine."

ThePrevailer,Christianity,1389106802.0,"God is who He is. His nature is fixed. He can't be anything else. The bible tells us that God is love and also just. Blanket condemnation for everyone who has never heard the Word is clearly unjust. I can only conclude that they don't all go to hell.

So what does happen? God judges their heart. Scripture tells us that all men have the knowledge of God in their heart. It's innate to man. How people respond to this can be judged. If someone on an island in the Pacific is truly seeking God, I believe salvation is possible, even without knowing the name ""Jesus Christ."" 

Rom 2:14-16 For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them.

andystealth,AskReddit,1389107080.0,"I would absolutely love to see that gap closed as well, though to be fair it's not entirely the government ignoring it or being racist.

There is still a large distrust between a lot of indigenous communities and 'white folk'. Particularly those in authority positions like police force, or in some cases schooling. 

I've known people that have gone and taught out in these places and in a lot of the cases the kids that show up definitely want to be there and learn. But sometimes they'll also just not show up for a few weeks because they were doing stuff with the family/going walk-a-bout/don't give an explanation. 

There is a definitive clash of cultures here, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, for either group to lose their culture entirely would be horrendous. The difficulty therefore is trying to teach an indigenous culture that wants to hold onto its old identity, in a western culture kind of way. Especially if a large amount of those community is distrusting of white people, because their parents/grandparents have taught them to be, due to our checkered past.

I believe in time the gap will certainly close, but it's going to take time to gain the trust of the communities enough to do so, and a restructuring of education in indigenous areas. Unfortunately that last part will most likely be seen as racist, and also lead to less trust from the very communities it would be designed for."

SeaBrass,DebateAnAtheist,1389107194.0,"&gt;There is no objective way to prove through reason that a man is not living his life in something comparable to the 1999 film, the Matrix. However, just because a man cannot know something through reason with one-hundred percent certainty, this certainly does not mean humans cannot still reason and progress with the use of both faith and reason.

This quote seems to be the most succinct portion of the article that is relevant to the topic of this thread, so I will address it here.  If your claim is that we can be more certain of Descartes's *cogito* than we can be of the existence or nonexistence of gods, then I think we agree.

However, you seem to be making the common mistake of equating faith with a lack of 100% certainty.  If that is what faith means to you, then strictly speaking, we have faith in everything except the laws of logic (and possibly mathematics).  But that is not how religious faith is defined.  The [Catholic Encyclopedia](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05752c.htm), for example, defines faith as follows:

&gt;Objectively, it stands for the sum of truths revealed by God in Scripture and tradition and which the Church (see RULE OF FAITH) presents to us in a brief form in her creeds, **subjectively, faith stands for the habit or virtue by which we assent to those truths. It is with this subjective aspect of faith that we are here primarily concerned.**   

The fact that religious faith represents a mismatch between that which can be reasonably believed on the basis of evidence, and that which is actually believed, becomes clear later in the same article:

&gt;If the authority upon which we base our assent is human and therefore fallible, we have human and fallible faith; **if the authority is Divine, we have Divine and infallible faith.**  

Just prior to this passage the author contrasts faith in human ""authority,"" such as the fact that we accept the conclusions of scientific experiments without performing the experiments ourselves, with supposedly divine authority.  This analogy is a false one, because we could, if desired, perform the experiments for ourselves, or consult those who have performed the experiments.  This crucial ability to check our sources is not available in religious faith:

&gt;Divine faith, then, is that form of knowledge which is derived from Divine authority, and which consequently **begets absolute certitude in the mind of the recipient.**  

&gt;That such Divine faith is necessary, follows from the fact of Divine revelation. **For revelation means that the Supreme Truth has spoken to man and revealed to him truths which are not in themselves evident to the human mind. We must, then, either reject revelation altogether, or accept it by faith; that is, we must submit our intellect to truths which we cannot understand, but which come to us on Divine authority.**

The problem, then, lies in the fact that religious faith demands that we profess *absolute certaintly* in claims that are not only less than absolutely certain and not self-evident, but also *beyond our ability to verify or comprehend, even in principle.*  It is this faith that atheists reject, and which theists themselves reject with respect to every religion except their own."

madhjsp,nfl,1389107331.0,"You are correct that it is very commercialized. Many American fans also complain that ad breaks are too common and sometimes too long, but it's something we've grown accustomed to, I guess.  

The game in general is very stop/start by it's nature, but I think most fans will agree that what happens on the field between the plays helps set the table for something potentially dramatic to happen once each play starts: the opposing coaches have to select the right play for their team based on the game situation and what they suspect their opponent plans to do (a cat-and-mouse strategy game, of sorts), players on both sides may substitute as the situation calls for it (certain situations may call for specialist players to come into action), and before the ball is snapped, players on both sides may need to identify necessary changes to the called play in order to best counter what their opponent plans to do. So even though the action isn't constant, the other strategic nuances of the sport are pretty captivating to a lot of fans. Combine that with impressively athletic play and a dose of violence, and you have a product that appeals to sports fans on multiple levels - intellectually and viscerally.  

Hope that helps explain the fascination with football. At the end of the day, I think you have to watch a few games to really give it a chance and see if it's for you. With the playoffs currently underway, the games are much more meaningful and usually some of the most competitive contests of the season, so now is the right time. "

Because this is modern we expect SH to grow as a person; we expect to see more from him, it's more interesting.  But it's not in line with the novels.  Essentially, once SH becomes the guy who loves his best friend and can express it, who can be happy for people, who can express proper emotion; he's stopped being the original Sherlock Holmes who believed that all that emotion nonsense was for the underclasses.

It sounds like he's missed out on a lot of important things in your life(namely all the abuse, which while horrible is still important and a parent should be aware of it), and I think it's pretty brave of you to try keeping/improving your relationship with him under these circumstances.

I think it'd be worth emailing him and very clearly, carefully, and unemotionally laying out what you need from him for the relationship to work. But you *have* to enforce the boundaries.

Then they make positive claims about things like the ability to turn invisible, or fly, that Operating Thetans can apparently do, but nobody has yet managed. Again, stuff that they claim is being done via physics, but which is physically impossible.

SoyBeanExplosion,apple,1389107726.0,"1) It doesn't matter how good the default app is - the quality of it is not a valid argument in favour of restricting the freedom to choose a different one. How would you feel if Microsoft told you that you aren't allowed to change your default browser from Internet Explorer because they feel it's good enough? I mean, you can still *use* Chrome and Firefox, so it's okay right?

2) Your argument about allowing other browsers to become default boils down to ""Apple doesn't allow changing default apps because it's too confusing.""

 If you honestly think Apple would have a support headache by allowing the default browser to be changed, I think you underestimate the intelligence of most people. They've managed with Windows for years, I'm *fairly* sure they can handle changing the default web browsers. They're not total idiots, and they don't need Daddy Apple to solve such simple choices for them. Don't project your own technological ineptitude on to the general user base.

silverionmox,europe,1389107779.0,"When there is unemployment (and there always will be, because owners can always delay hiring workers but the unemployed cannot delay their living expenses), removing the minimum wage will only allow employers to pay less than before to the employees that were having minimum wage before. That will reverberate because then there's empty space on the wage ladder, lowering all other wages too.

The experience you get at the bottom of labor market is worthless anyway - in fact, it's better to omit that you've been working such jobs on your cv because it will brand you as unqualified, unable to get anything better. Low wage work does not come with respect.

Training programs training the unemployed into professions which are in high demand are much more efficient for both the unemployed and potential employers (who prefer to poach qualified employees rather than risking to invest in education themselves, which is another reason why there's a lack of qualified personnel to fill job openings).

If we were talking 1-2 minutes I can see where it would be way too quick, but at least you're putting in some staying power there. If your main concern is making sure your partner is satisfied, I would focus more on making sure there was a nice, long foreplay session where she is already brought close to the edge and is just raring to go. That is much easier to control and more realistic to achieve than doing a 20+ minute session of actual PIV sex. 

In order to actually last longer with her you can try any combination of the following (YMMV with each, so play around with different combinations):

1. Try masturbating to orgasm a few hours earlier that day to take some of the ""edge"" off 
2. Use a condom with numbing lube on the inside; it will reduce the intensity of the stimulation on you.
3. Slow down with the thrusting. Once inside her, focus more on moving your hips in a circular motion, rather than a thrusting one.
4. Try to just slow your mind and the whole mood as well. Don't focus on any one thing too much, just slowly take in the whole experience of having her body next to yours. Focus on the sensuality over the sexuality."

The same way you can dismiss the existence of leprechauns, demons, unicorns, the tooth fairy, Apollo, or any number of mythical entities. Until there is evidence to support the existence of these things, you can dismiss their existence. The null hypothesis is the default starting position.

That's the core of the problem. No, the null hypothesis is not more likely than any other. That's merely a pragmatic convention, which only holds true in reality as we know it because we make such specific hypotheses. The more specific a hypothesis, the less likely it is. A very general hypothesis, like the existence of a bigger matrushka or not, is all-encompassing so there is no preference."

Yet, somehow just about every other example of someone doing mushrooms in a movie ends up with them having elaborate hallucinations where they directly interact with characters who either are imaginary in general, or simply not present. I think it gives them too much credit to pretend like they're doing that to express what the characters' affected state of mind is like; they're just using drugs as a vehicle for whatever plot point happens during their ""trip"", and that's pretty much the same as when characters smoke pot or even drink alcohol in many cases."

tomanonimos,politics,1389107963.0,"I will exclude WWI since I am not really knowledgeable of that war.

Civil War: It ended with  the surrender of the Confederate army. Meaning there were only patches of troops combating the Union. The war ended but there were still small conflicts going on in the South. There was a winner because no matter how many times the ""Neo-Confederates"" tried fighting back they could not win over the Union because of numbers and equipment. In addition the confederate land was occupied by Union troops. Hence the Union Victory.  

WWII: We bombed the hell out of Germany and had troops occupy the country. We eliminated any possible means for the Germans to fight back. In Japan we nuked them and occupied their country. 

The ""victory condition"" is basically destroy your enemies source of military power and occupy their land (wiping them out falls under this category but we probably wont be seeing a genocide). 

The reason its not a victory in the Afghanistan War is because we have not destroyed their source of military power and have not occupied their land completely. There are some areas in Afghanistan and Pakistan where, though there is a military presence, the U.S. is not occupying it at all.  

TL;DR Occupation and destroying a groups source of military power is considered victory conditions.

Trigger23,hockey,1389108258.0,"Who's likely to play better with Crosby? And who had trouble developing chemistry with linemates in Vancouver? 

I'm not making an argument for or against, but those seem to be the biggest driving rationalizations behind Kunitz's projected inclusion on the squad, along with his chemistry with Getzlaf/Perry. It gives Babcock veteran players (which he makes no secret of favoring), and two line combinations that have several seasons of proof.

I honestly think we could see both on the squad when the tourney kicks off, especially if Stamkos and Couture are both unable. No matter what, a handful of arguably deserving players will be left off the team. "

I'm 25 now, but I remember the day I got my Charizard like it was yesterday...

I couldn't have been more than 11 or 12 at the time, but everyone on my block, regardless of their age, loved Pokemon. One kid in particular, Dan, had a great collection of cards. He prided himself on having *all* of them. Well, I went to the local book stores on weekends and played in the Pokemon leagues. During my time there, I actually picked up  one or two imported Japanese holographic cards and a handful of regular cards. Nothing too exotic mind you.

I decided that I would throw down like 7 or 8 of these Japanese cards and convince Dan they were indeed rare and if he wanted to say he had ALL of the Pokemon cards, he'd need them. Yes, this was slightly manipulative of me--but I NEEDED that Charizard. After two or three hours on his driveway, negotiating the deal, he finally removed the card from his plastic binder and the Charizard was mine.

I put the card in my binder, clutched it to my chest and ran the fuck home, convinced that Ninja assassin's would get me or in all likelihood, the kid would chase me down and tell me he had changed his mind."

devonclaire,Dogtraining,1389108316.0,"OK, can we talk desensitization? Here's what the [ASPCA's website](http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/virtual-pet-behaviorist/dog-behavior/desensitization-and-counterconditioning) has to say about it: 

*Desensitization starts with showing or exposing an animal to a weak, less threatening version of the thing he fears or dislikes. We weaken the thing or event by making it smaller, slower, shorter lasting, farther away, less noisy, or still rather than moving. Over time, as the pet habituates at that low exposure, we gradually make the thing (person, animal, place, object, noise, event, etc.) stronger again by, for example, bringing it closer, increasing its volume or having it move. So a systematic desensitization plan starts with exposure to the least scary version of the feared thing and gradually moves to stronger versions until full or normal exposure is reached.*

How would I go about doing this? We don't have the consent or cooperation of the rival dog's owners. The Arch Enemy dog is a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel...so should I try to find another cavelier with owners who I could pay to work with my dog?

Alternatively, is there someway I could desensitize her to the scent of this dog's pee? Thanks for your help.

I play at night, usually for an in game day or so, and the. Update the blogger page on the train to work on the morning.

It an interesting mechanic to the gameplay because it forces me to play the character with some kind rule set rather than just randomly do whatever, whenever.

This character has a drive to her decisions: right now, at this moment she is determined to get to Dark Water Crossing because this is the last place she is told she was before waking up in an Imperial Carriage.  She has no recollection who she is, save for her name, or what she is doing in Skyrim.  

All of her decisions right now, have to do with getting to Dark Water Crossing, but she keeps sidetracking herself because something *unknown* is drawing her to seek out why she feels, deep down, that the dragons are related to her recent total amnesia.

I'm only on in game day three for this character and she has just helped defeat The dragon at west watch tower.  She has figured out that this dragon is not the same as the dragon in Helgen, that the dragons speak her language as well, that she now has the full understanding of Fus, the word that spoke to her at BFB, and that she may be this person of prophecy the locals call ""Dragonborn.""

This is why I suggest waiting until the international court comes back with a ruling. If it's in Australia's favor, then Japan won't have a leg to stand on.

Blanco never had a chance of replacing Franco.  Spain had already fought a war with Franco and half the country did not support him, they were waiting for their moment and Franco's death set it off.  

As Spain became the last fascist nation in Western Europe it was becoming more and more difficult to implement fascism in that era.  There had already been numerous bloody labor strikes and protests since the ""end"" of the civil war, the people had been demanding change.

(32 F - 32) / 2 = 0 C

(212 F - 32) / 2 = 90 C (actually it's 100, but, close enough). For better precision, add 10%: 90 + 90/10 = 99 C, pretty damn close.

(-40 F - 32) / 2 = -36 (or -36 + -36/10 = -39.6)

(98 F - 32 ) / 2 = 33 (or 33 + 33/10 = 36.3) pretty close to body temp.

A nice spring day, (78 - 32) / 2 = 23 ( + 10% = 25.2).

Temp right now where I am: (43  - 32) / 2 = 5.5 ( + 10% = 6 C)."

undergroundmonorail,AskReddit,1389108564.0,"My current window manager supports this (in fact, mouse support is pretty shoddy imo) and most of what I do is done with the keyboard. I'd like to get more done with it, but I'm super lazy so I haven't learned yet.

If my computer is off and I want to go to reddit, this is what I do:

1. Press ""power"". Spoiler: This is the last time my hands leave the keyboard.
2. Type `monorail` and my password to log in.
4. Type `x` (aliased to `startx`) to start the WM.
5. Hit `$mod+d` to bring up `dmenu`.
6. Type `chr` and hit enter to launch Chromium.
7. Type `r` and hit enter to get to reddit.

It's a tiling WM (which basically just means that windows always take up as much space as they can without overlapping, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/WgpZtIb.png)), which lets you do useful stuff with the keyboard as well. `$mod+j` moves your focus left, `$mod+k` moves it down, `$mod+l` moves it up and `$mod+semicolon` moves it right. Add `shift` to any of those commands and it moves the entire window. You can resize windows or change the display method from the keyboard as well. Things like that.

I know you acknowledged that it's possible, but I just wanted to show that it happens."

grisoeil,science,1389108597.0,"But do they really? I don't argue that they have to work pretty hard, but do they have to work harder than kids?

I think we're downplaying how hard a child must work to learn a language. For the first year, they are mute. They start practising some nonsensical blabber after 1 year and maybe saying their first words after that? Still at 2 years of full language immersion they suck pretty badly. By the third and forth year it starts to come together but they still have a very limited vocabulary and the overall sentence construction is still very childish. So it's roughly 5 to six years of work on the language, non-stop, but they won't have as rich a vocabulary and be as fluent as an adult until they hit their 11-12 year of life. That's quite a lot of time!

On the other hand, an adult being exposed to a language 24/7 and being talked to continuously will learn to be quite proficient before the 3rd year and will probably be as fluent as most adults will ever be by the fifth year. After that, if they keep living in that language environment and they keep reading, they can probably reach academic standards by their 6th-8th year, easily giving the impression of not just someone who is as fluent as any other person in that language, but of someone who is particularly adept with words."

* **[Stephen Clarke - A Year in The Merde](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Year_in_the_Merde)** : One of the few books that made me laugh out loud, but that might be because I could relate to it.

There is no need to buy a $200 index when you will only use 6 bits 90% of the time.

Maybe [Masonry Bits](http://www.harborfreight.com/5-piece-masonry-drill-bit-set-43694.html) you may or may not need them, but having them in the tool box is nice when you need them.

2 good crescent wrenches a small (8"") and a large (12"")

A cheap claw hammer  
A cheap hacksaw and some extra blades one with the lowest TPI (teeth per inch) and one with a high TPI

On the other hand tools like a hacksaw handle or hammer are so basic they will last even if they are low end.

Handyland,cycling,1389109170.0,"Alright, cool.  So, what I'm going to recommend depends on what exactly your budget is, and how serious you want to be about riding.  In general, the more you want to get into the sport, the more you're going to have to invest (though there are always cheaper ways out there).

Base level is just hop on your bike in shorts or pants that are slim at the ankle (to avoid things catching on the chain) or roll up your pant legs.  Relatively slim t-shirt will help you against the wind.  Pick up some cages or toe clips or something along those lines for your pedals online, they shouldn't be too expensive and make a big difference in riding.  Pair with comfortable, slim shoes.

What will help is buying clothing that is more fitted (again because of wind) and that is designed for sports.  So you could get cheap exercise shorts and something comparable for your upper body that will deal with sweat much better than cotton.  Another thing to watch out for is chaffing.  This is why, when wearing lycra, one doesn't wear underwear.  I may be wrong, but under armor and similar brands may do underwear-type athletic wear.

Next level up and we're getting to lycra (spandex-like clothing), which is important if you eventually want to do group rides on the weekends.  Padded cycling shorts (which feature chamois in the butt) are great for spending time in the saddle, and the tighter fit of the lycra is good for riding.  They make different cuts of lycra gear, some being somewhat loose and casual, others being what is considered 'race fit', which is tight and aerodynamic.  If you're going to buy lycra, you can skimp on the jersey as long as it fits, but I'd at least get *decent* shorts.  Take a peek through [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Velo/comments/1cn4k4/best_kit/) for brand recommendations by the people who spend the most time in the saddle: racers.  Bib shorts are better than regular shorts, though cost slightly more in general.  If you're still experiencing chaffing with this stuff, look up chamois cream.  Also, lycra jerseys have pockets on the lower back for easy access to stuff like food, any extra gear (though saddle bags should carry most of that), and ID and money.  Don't go out without ID and some cash, just in case.

Also, good socks make a difference.  The kind designed for cycling, and therefore wick sweat like crazy.  Personally, I like wearing fingerless, padded gloves when I ride.  The slight padding on the palms mute some of the road noise, and if/when you fall, they help prevent road rash on your palms (a terrible place to have it).  They also make leg warmers and arm warmers to pair with short-sleeved and short-legged kit, meaning you don't have to buy two pairs of everything.

It should also be mentioned at this level that clipless pedals are awesome.  These are the types where you buy shoes that take a cleat which 'clips' or 'clicks' into a clipless pedal.  They're termed clipless because they replaced the old style toe clips.  Clipless pedals mean you're connected to the pedal through the entirety of the revolution, providing more balanced muscle work and higher potential power output.  Clipless shoes and pedals can be had for a *wide* variety of prices, depending on how much you care about performance.  You could spend anywhere from $100 for some used, cheap pedals and shoes, to over $1000 for all carbon, ultra-light, highly ventilated (for the shoes) stuff.

Last thing: whatever level you choose to invest in, buy a goddamn helmet."

Honestly, it sounds like your method would result in a spoiled brat. I don't know your kid, but I know mine, and if I had to indulge their every wish at the dinner table every day, I'd not only end up with a couple of entitled assholes, I'd run out of money really fast. 

Maybe that's not what you meant. I've tried to interpret what you are saying in as many well-intentioned ways as I can, but all I can come up with is you advocating teaching kids to be entitled assholes.

The goal of ""eat what is put in front of you"" is not ”I am the parent, I'm in control, you will do as I say or starve."" The goal is ""you can't always get what you want"". It's a pretty important lesson to learn. If I had my way, I'd eat sushi everyday, but I can't afford that. I'm not broken up about it, I don't throw temper tantrums when I don't get my spicy tuna, I don't demand that my husband stop what he is doing, and go out and buy me some.

incogito_ergo,leangains,1389109261.0,"The studies had them dosing throughout the day, not fasted.  If you want to try n=1, do some moderate intensity cardio with a HRM. eat, dose 20mg ephedrine 200g caffeine (throw in some l-tyrosine as well if you have it). Do the same cardio. Heart rate will be 20ish bpm higher. Heart rate is a good proxy for metabolic rate, so it's pretty easy to verify this for yourself. Will dig up Lyle's stuff on EC when I have a minute. 

For clarification, I am not suggesting that they alter lipolysis in a fed state, but rather that they alter net energy balance for the day, leading to greater fat loss, and alter partitioning, leading to greater fat loss and sparing of LBM. Do the partitioning effects happen in a fed state, no.  But both drugs have a half-life of 3-6 hours, so dosing regularly will produce efficacious levels when insulin levels drop back down after your meal (if you eat constantly for 18 hours a day, then yes, you will probably see minimal benefit), in addition to some increased caloric expenditure due to elevated heart rate. Dosing irregularly is less likely to be effective, hence the normal 3x per day regimen being the universally recommended approach. 

Finally, I'll note that there is a huge difference between a carb refeed following partial or complete glycogen depletion and a regular meal. A refeed typically involved a long period of elevated insulin levels while 500-1000g of carbs are consumed. You can see, I'm sure, that that is not the same circumstance as a regular meal. "

positmylife,childfree,1389109307.0,"Let's be fair to the reproductive system. First, there are several systems set up to ensure only the genes best fit for survival make it past fertilization. It's actually pretty difficult for sperm to get to eggs because the entire environment around the egg is acidic and the egg itself is like a bank vault. That's pretty intense. For the reproductive system itself, a woman's body is ready for a baby every 4 weeks. It refreshes every time too. That's bloody well suited to reproduction (pardon the pun). Then you consider how much happens during the 9 months of pregnancy. Cells are dividing and becoming specialized. Meanwhile, her body forms support structures and rearranges things to make room. It's all quite amazing. The only part that gets really dicey for the reproductive parts is the last month or so when the baby is too much for it to support and birth. And despite the fact that it gets torn up, even with all the pain, those parts were made to stretch. There may be a less painful way to conduct birthing, but before birthing happens, that birth canal has to be sealed so bacteria doesn't get in an make the baby sick. It has to be a relatively small hole to begin with or nothing will survive gestation. I know it seems very violent and gross (and it is) but it's remarkably well suited to its job.

First off, every game absolutely does matter. If yall had been able to finish the job against A&amp;M in 98, you would have played for the title. You didn't. If Oklahoma St had held off Iowa State in double overtime in 2011, it would have been an LSU-OSU championship. They didn't. Quit your bitching and win next time. [EDIT TO ADD: Also, if you're going to claim your #4 team ""deserved"" a BCS bowl, try not losing to unranked Purdue in the bowl game that was so beneath you. I would claim that's an example of the BCS getting it exactly right.]

More broadly, the bowl system may rob us of good matchups in the postseason, but it gives much more significance to regular season games that would otherwise be meaningless. Make a wholesale switch from bowls to a 16-team, NFL-style playoff, and this year's Iron Bowl means nothing. The Clemson-FSU game means nothing. The OU-Baylor game means nothing. All of these teams go to the playoffs and have a shot at the title, and you have an NFL situation where the vast majority of regular season games are merely interesting, not consequential. 

That's what I want to avoid. Frankly I don't give a shit whether you got into the bowl you think you *deserved*. That's part of the game, like missed calls and bad bounces. I have no interest in ""fair."" I want a sport that makes me stay home on Saturday nights for 3 months to watch teams I don't even care about, because every week holds a game that could mean the difference between the championship and the Alamo Bowl.

Also, side note, I think it's important to separate ""bowls vs. playoffs"" from ""the BCS."" The BCS is shady as hell, and there are a lot of things about it that need fixing. But replacing it with a playoff because it's not perfect is myopic and could destroy the sport as we know it."

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1389109397.0,"It totally depends on the facility and how it is run. As a guy who used to work in various medical institutions, the thing about them is that they are made of people, and with people being imperfect in their perceptions and prejudices, the same can reflect in the institutions they work for.  Keep in mind that there are a lot of nurses and doctors with self-important god-complexes who are still relying on old-school practices, methods and understandings because they, like many other people, have a hard time accepting new information which conflicts with what they were originally taught.  This can carry over into prejudice against autistics.  Also keep in mind that it was only a few decades ago that homosexuals and transgendered folks were being sent to the psych ward just for being what they are and there are still a lot of medical professionals who still believe that's an appropriate course of action despite that they are no longer allowed to take it, and there are a number of inconspicuous, passive-aggressive little ways in which they can refuse to render appropriate services or conveniently leave out certain recommendations and resources for those whom they are prejudiced against.  (I speak also as a gay guy who has witnessed a fair amount of homophobia still residing in some medical institutions, even in a fairly liberal area like mine - Northeast U.S.) 

Edit: I don't mean to sow paranoia about the U.S. medical system.  Despite it's faults, there are a lot of genuinely good people who staff it, but it depends on the institution and the environment which management creates within those facilities.  I don't think it's wise to implicitly trust any institution or the people in it.

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskMen,1389109664.0,"Two words you need to help you here: abundance mentality. 

You see, this girl is a safe receptacle for all your sexual desires. She's already rejected you, so you can safely feel that way for her because let's face it, falling for new people *really really* sucks. You could get rejected. They may be snotty bitches about it. It's impossible to figure out if a girl likes you. Whatever other things that freak you out. 

Now you're already one step ahead since you've dated someone else, and that's good. Date more people. 

The reason why I think this is an attachment and not genuine attraction is that she's rejected you already and you're still crushing on her. You seem smart enough to know that you don't have a chance in hell with her. This isn't because you're some nasty looking/unattractive person, you two just aren't compatible. Happens all the goddamned time, it's life. 

I'm speaking in general terms because I don't know how much you've read into the subject, so I'm sorry if I'm being a little too much with this. 

You really gotta start questioning the feelings. Like:

""Why do I like her?""

If it's just because, ""she's hot,"" then it's just physical. You want her and have been throwing a bunch of other feelings at her. 

Now unless she's like the sweetest, kindest and most incredibly amazing girl ever (spoiler: she's not), there's no reason for you to like her. And it's this realization that slowly makes it OK. No woman or man is as amazing as you're making her out to be. 

Realize that there's millions of other women out there. You've had a girlfriend, you can have another one. Remember that.

That said my advice: treat the relationship more like a marathon than a sprint.  Shift your focus from ""here and now"" to ""there and then,"" but still keep the youthful exuberance.  ""I"" has to  become ""we"" and ""you"" needs to become... well, ""you"" but the plural version.

It's just a symptom of a greater problem with what feminism is and has been since well before I was born.

Some working class nobody has his dick cut off and is accused--with no evidence--of rape and abuse by a woman who cut his dick off and was quoted by police of complaining about his *sexual performance* rather than any of that supposed abuse when they arrested her.

viewless25,mindcrack,1389110215.0,"**Announce the UHC a week before the upload of the first episode.** Tell the People the teams, the rules, and the date it was played on. This is something Guude talked about doing, but has not yet done. I think UHC 13 showed prospect for the idea of announcing a UHC before its upload. Aside from the obvious reasons of hype increasing the views of the long awaited first episode, its better for the viewers to be able to prepare for the first episode. For example, many servers have begun posting bets on the games. The system of betting on the game (using in game items such as diamonds of course) is a little bit crippled by beginning after the first episode aired. Not all teams are equal because some have gotten gold or diamonds, some have lost a few players or taken damage, some had better spawns than others. The betting isn't fair with the first episode being out. But if teams are announced beforehand, betting becomes fair and exciting. On a similar note, there's also the fantasy UHC website out now. Like betting, its tainted by the first episode spoiling the action. It also can increase fan interaction by allowing fans to create intros, fan arts, and other works that add to the UHC experience."

squashedbananas,TheBluePill,1389110281.0,"Sorry, I'm doing a horrible job here trying to be clear.

For one thing, I'm not arguing with you. I don't need to, because I know that what I've been doing has been working for me. I have doctor's visits to back it up, which is good enough for me. So maybe you're arguing with me, but I don't know why you would feel a need to. I think you should just be happy that someone's health is improving, right?

Anyway, just to be clearer, cutting calories in the past while not doing paleo has not worked for me in terms of overall health, at least not for longer than a month or two. I'll lose weight, but gain it all back really quickly, and my period was still only coming once every three or four months, and my skin was terrible, and I was gassy like *all* the time (lots of TMI going on in here, sorry), and I could go on and on. Sure, I lost like 20 pounds, but I felt like crap.

Cutting calories in a paleo diet (although, god, I hate the term paleo) has not only helped me keep weight off, but it's helped with all those other problems I just mentioned, too.  Hell, sometimes I think it's even improved my mood! But then I go on reddit and that gets shot to hell. :)

So, while I'm not disagreeing that eating lower calories leads to lower weight (because I'm not an idiot), and I'm certainly not calling myself a special snowflake (really, what's with your hostility here?), I'm saying that weight loss is not really my primary motivation for liking paleo. Yeah, it's great that I've lost 40 pounds, but I could do that while eating 500 calories of chips every day. Paleo has helped with so much  more!

Anyway, I'm done now. I don't like feeling like I'm talking in circles. Unless it's circlejerking about how much TRP sucks, of course! Let's get back to that."

By my estimate I spent an average of an hour a day working to build that community, probably around 500 hours total. Just because most mods are content to clear out the spam filter doesn't mean that's all I was doing.

&gt;Whether I was spending hours learning CSS, guiding clueless celebrity comedians through AMAs, or writing 1000-word essays to funny (that they ignored), I fucking worked at this. And I never made a dime for it; it wasn't about that. All I wanted was an audience for comics who couldn't get one otherwise. I even bought $25 worth of advertising in /r/funny, out of my own pocket. If the stats were accurate, it netted us maybe 15 subscribers, compared to the 500-1000 we'd get from an organic xpost. Despite the insistence from one /r/funny mod that I do so, I flat-out can't afford to buy advertising for our subreddit.

Sorry, I've said this before, but I don't feel bad for him. Working hard at reddit and getting mad when nothing happens is like banging your head against a brick wall until you have a concussion and getting mad all you did was scratch it.

In Sweden we don't use pandemrix for people under the age of 20 unless the recommended vaccine is not available and if vaccination against the H1N1 flu is deemed necessary.

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,amiugly,1389110437.0,"I'd like to tell you a story about a friend of mine. 

You see, this friend, like you, has a pretty shitty father. He calls her a whore and a slut at every opportunity, to the point where she confessed to me that she now finds sex to be disgusting, to the point where she's afraid to even have it. And that's all well and good, but it's a clear result of her dad being a drunken wreck. 

Her father and your father have something in common: they don't amount to jack shit. He's an alcoholic, he doesn't pay child support, he is essentially a worthless human being who no one would mourn if he died. He's literally a waste of good food and air and space better suited for other people. Your dad sounds worse than her dad, and that's who I'm describing here.

Nutrition wise: Can of soup I have is like 200 calories. A typical diet needs 2000. Basic nutrition: eat vegetables and white meat primarily, substitute in whatever you want, and you'll have a proper diet, no fear of becoming fat. If this is more mental, then therapy's recommended. I had to go too for different reasons, and they'll help you deal with that.

The moral of the story: like you, my friend is not an unattractive woman as she believes herself to be. In fact, like you, she's quite pretty. I really like spending time with her, and if we were friends I suspect I'd also like hanging out with you.

Dantilli,introvert,1389110447.0,"You're very welcome. One thing I would like to add is about over-observance. Instead of focussing outwards and having it cause problems for you, try focussing inwards. Instead of focussing on other peoples habits and reactions, focus on your own. It makes writing the list easier as you will be more aware of what you are feeling and why in any given situation. It makes sense to put your powers of observation to use in a more constructive way.

I would also recommend mindfulness meditation. It has nothing to do with religion it's just a very helpful method of focussing inwards and calming your thoughts. Not only that but also makes it easier to understand the motivation and feeling behind your thoughts. It's been an extremely useful tool for me for both calming myself down and for learning about myself, i'd encourage you to try it. I can't remember where I learned it but google it, you should find plenty information. The basic idea is to focus on one thing and just that one thing, no thoughts, for a certain period of time. I personally just focus on my breathing, but don't manually breathe, focus on the sensation of air leaving your nostrils. You'll find thoughts constantly float up and distract you, just bring your mind back to your breathing each time. 

I find when I do this I become acutely aware of the emotions surrounding a thought, often these are emotions I didn't notice before. Try and do that for 10 mins a day. Yes it will be f-ing hard, but don't be discouraged, it's only 10 minutes and it has quite a few benefits. Not the least of which being scientifically proven to improve your ability to focus, though i'm not sure exactly how many studies have come to that conclusion. Just don't pressure yourself to do well at it, just try and do it for 10 mins a day. Literally give up caring how long you can focus for and just do it, otherwise you'll never manage to keep the habit up.

Also consider the fact that as you are now, in fact in anyones case, your values are never perfectly constant. Some of them are, some of them gradually change over time with experience. It's fine for them to be semi-flexible, but if you find a concept in which your opinions changes quickly and often, usually there is a deeper concept that you agree with which provides an explanation for the chopping and changing, does that make sense? either that or it's not important to you which side the coin falls on regarding that particular idea.

Anyway, hope this last bit helps, tis time for me to stop procrastinating on the internet :)."

When I tried to install again it was stuck on preparing to download for about an hour and a half (I also tried to download Firefox and that download failed).

Additionally, look at the price. If it seems too good to be true, you can bet your bottom dollar that it is. 

I would also recommend if you accidentally got a fake, or you purposefully bought a fake to use as a dupe: DO NOT USE IT. These companies are not tested for what they use in the ingredients for the makeup, which means they are going to use the cheapest shit they could find and it could be dangerous. Never put something on your eye when you're not sure what it is or where it came from. It may seem overly careful to the point of being neurotic, but you have to be so so careful when it comes to this stuff.

Bevolicious18,AskMen,1389110602.0,"I think the thing about marriage is an interesting point that varies hugely depending where in the United States is being discussed.

For example, the classic joke about schools in the South is that girls are told ""You'll get a ring by Spring, or you'll get your money back."" Obviously sexism is pervasive in the entire phrase but I hear it used relatively often as a joke at my university on the West Coast.

It's actually usually said by women here who seem to want to separate themselves from the idea that they're only purpose in college is to look for a potential husband.

The average marriage age also varies pretty widely depending upon which state is being discussed. Here in California for example women don't get married on average until 27 and men at 29 on average. Still not 35 as in your example but certainly late enough to have degrees and jobs established.

These numbers go down to an average of 23 for plenty of other states though. Source [here](http://www.livescience.com/27974-women-media-age-marriage-states.html) on the average U.S. marriage age by state."

krofinzki,aspergers,1389110726.0,"This led to my relationship ending, it took many years but it eventually she and I both could barely relate to each other on a sexual level anymore.

I don't know of me being an aspie has anything to do with it but I was indeed very sensitive, so sensitive that I just could not keep on going for more than a few minutes. I don't mean it hurt I mean it felt so good, so good it was impossible to keep going for more than like two-three minutes of penetration and this made me feel horrible. Firstly I felt like I failed in doing my part in our relationship, I wasn't giving her any orgasms anymore, which I had been doing just fine in the beginning, multiple even (when you have sex all the time the sensitivity goes down A LOT). I felt like I had become less of a man. Every time we had sex I felt like I failed and it got worse every single time.
Time between sex increased and after a while it could be months inbetween and after a month of no sex... it's impossible to keep going for more than a minute. Which made it even worse.

In the end, I didn't want to have sex. I would worry about sex, feel anxious about it. Not because I didn't find her attractive (I did - and still do, even though it's over) but because I felt like I was failing the woman I loved.

One advice I can give is... find out how often he masturbates. Because masturbation does not require any performance, you can't fail another person doing it. If he masturbates a lot then maybe my experience matches his. I have no idea if it does, just trying to be helpful... I know what it's like with the dead bedrooms and knowing you are the cause of it.

alk3v,truegaming,1389110867.0,"Agreeing with you here. Many East Asian languages have multiple speech styles, Korean (which I am more familiar with) does the same thing. I'm not sure if we should be counting them all as multiple pronouns for 'I', as you generally avoid mixing speech styles designed for different 'highness' of speech. E.g. there's no use of 'ore' around a highly esteemed individual. Just like you won't speak with the Korean president in heavily embellished language then refer to yourself as 'na'/나.

Going back to the original post, the main cultural difference the East has with the West is definitely a suppression of the self (kind of taking roots in Confucianism). Which is why I'd expect to still see hero role play (like in Zelda, Mario etc). What we don't see is the stereotypical 'war hero' or 'lone gunman'.

Blacksheep01,Bitcoin,1389111065.0,"Not all leftists are statists, good god. The original anarchists of the 19th century (sometimes called [Libertarian socialists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism)), the people that all of you anarcho-capitalists/Libertarians got your titles from, did not believe in centralized authority or the state, but still believed in collectivism to a degree.

If you read that article, you will see the first ever usage of the word ""Libertarian"" on earth was by a French Anarcho-communist. If no one wants to read the Wikipedia page, here is a summary of Libertarian socialism/anarchism from the page - 

&gt; Libertarian socialism (sometimes called social anarchism or left-libertarianism) is a group of political philosophies that promote a non-hierarchical, non-bureaucratic society without private property in the means of production. Libertarian socialists believe in converting present-day private productive property into common or public goods, while retaining respect for personal property. Libertarian socialism is opposed to coercive forms of social organization. It promotes free association in place of government and opposes the social relations of capitalism, such as wage labor. The term libertarian socialism is used by some socialists to differentiate their philosophy from state socialism, and by some as a synonym for anarchism

I am not providing this info to get into a psychotic debate, but rather I'm posting it for informative purposes. Even if this appears to be to ""idealistic"" and unworkable to some of you, you all need to realize there are ""leftists"" who don't believe in a strong state either. You are thinking of state socialists or modern day ""liberals."" In the 19th century many anarchists, such as the famous Mikhail Bakunin, opposed Karl Marx and state communism but they were all leftists none the less."

In my field, no matter what their education level is, the same amount of training is involved because the industry is specialized. The folks that didn't go to college often end up with a multi-year experience advantage over those that did. The problem is finding these opportunities. It's often a matter of good luck, and it should not be this way. In the last decade, we have dropped the ball with regards to creating a system for bright young people wanting to enter a career and hit the ground running. It's become a lottery instead of a pathway. We need more apprenticeships, more paid internships, and a greater recognition that a degree is not a measure of intelligence. It is a measure of financial obligation, and for many careers, it makes more sense to start training them when they are young and fresh instead of know-it-alls saddled with massive debts."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389111306.0,"Twinsies! I grew up with similar thinking patterns that I actually need therapy to confront, but it's getting better as I confront them, which you most likely are discovering.

So this is why karma helps a lot with this. It's often simplified as ""actions"" in English translations, but I don't think this is complete, because in English, ""actions"" are most commonly limited to actions of the body. Karma refers to the actions of body, speech, and mind, which are dependent. So when Shakyamuni Buddha said ""we are born of our actions...live dependent on our actions"" he means everything. 

So positive (or wholesome) deeds have positive effects, while negative deeds have the opposite. It doesn't mean there isn't a place for conflicting views, which are unavoidable, but we are encouraged to try to engage in ""good faith"", i.e. for beneficial reasons.

It's ideal if good bodily actions are the product of good thoughts, but I think there is a lot to say for a ""fake it until you make it approach"", doing a good thing even if you don't feel like it, when trying to reinforce good habits. 

Just my 2¢."

Bevolicious18,AskMen,1389111414.0,"This is one that I always get into with people as well when discussing the merit of a business degree (my major of choice) from my school compared to a STEM degree.

According to a [report](http://www.naceweb.org/s09042013/salary-survey-average-starting-class-2013.aspx?mainindex-recslide1-spot-salsv-09062013) from the National Association of Colleges and Employers the average 2013 engineering starting salary was $62,000 and the average math/hard sciences starting salary was $43,000. The average starting salary for business majors at my university is $58,000 for comparison.

The more important factor to consider for me at least is the potential for growth in the salary amount for any given field. In other words it is much easier to find examples of business majors making far above what the average business major makes than it is to find examples of engineers making far above their average salary amounts.

Obviously it is still ridiculously difficult to make a salary over $100,000 or $200,000 or any number higher than these. But the way I look at it is that my business degree gives me an equal shot at starting salary as any engineer on average with more room for growth on average.

That's one of the reasons, besides my interest in the material, that I've chosen my major."

I honestly don't see us drafting a QB until next draft.  With the money that we owe  both Romo &amp; Orton we have to keep them next year.  After next year we can cut Orton and draft a younger guy behind Romo.  If we do it this year we are going to have to keep him on the roster because if we try to practice squad him there is no guarantee that we wouldn't lose him like Tanney.

But I think that would end up being a waste of a spot.  Going into gamedays next year we are much better off  being able to carry an extra backup lineman, LB, CB, WR, or basically anything but a 3rd string rookie QB that won't see the field."

Vzw has MUCH wider coverage, but once my road trip was done, I got rid of my verizon phone entirely, because for everything other than coverage, tmo beats vzw, and in my hometown, tmo has quite good coverage."

They met when they were 16/17 when she was in town to see a mutual friend where it was love at first sight. It didn't last too long at first since they lived in different states and both were heading out to college. My brother has the looks and charm so he went out to play the field like you do in college.

After a major breakup in his junior year, he decided to connect again with his HS crush. They reconnected and did a LD relationship for 3 years. They didn't have sex until 1 1/2 year in the LD LTR as she was saving herself up until she knew the relationship would eventually lead to marriage. My father worked for the airlines so my bro would fly for free to go see her once a month. When she graduated she moved to FL to live with him while he finished up his Masters degree and run his own business.

We gave my brother a lot of shit as they knew each other for 10 years until he proposed. He finally did with a song he wrote, married in '07, and when I saw him a couple weeks ago they were still very much in love.

My brother, who still a looker even in his mid 30s, has confided to me that he is still regularly hit on due to being the singer in a few cover bands for many years and even been in situations where women would try to seduce him.

Takuya-san,learnprogramming,1389111635.0,"Beginner programming doesn't take up any space and it can literally be done on 20 year old computers with the same common languages (C/C++, Java, Python, etc.). Compiling more complex things might take a tad longer, sure, but the important thing is that you can learn to code on any machine.

I recommend you either start with Python (simple, helps you with fundamentals) or C (this is ""hard mode,"" but it'll ground you in important concepts and will help you understand how computers work). Contrary to popular belief, C is actually not hard to pick up as a first language, you just need to take it slow.

Pick one of these two, and search Google for some tutorials. Pick whatever free IDE you like - Python might best be done in the IDE that comes with it, whereas C might best be done with Visual C++ Express (free) or maybe Eclipse or Netbeans.

If you feel like you'll have motivation problems, choose Python so that you can easily program some cool games. If you want to be a pro fast and you're willing to work hard for it, pick C. There's no shame in admitting you won't have the motivation, of course - better to learn something than nothing, and C can be picked up later."

Nah a lot of us post in here too

&gt; You can look fashionable with solid clothing, purchased off-season or second-hand, then tailored. You don't have to be a rich asshole to look good.

Please please point me where someone said that. No one said that you *had* to buy expensive clothes because that would be completely ridiculous

Hell /r/frugalmalefashion is mostly full of clothes that correspond to what you just described

&gt; What's really stupid about this particular drama is that it's posted to ""frugal"" fashion advice.

I'll repost what I said elsewhere:

&gt;Frugality is the quality of being frugal, **sparing**, thrifty, prudent or **economical**

Let's say I'm looking for a t-shirt and that the cheapest one I find who fills my need is 70$, and to me it is indeed worth 70$ for various reasons.

I then wait till it's on sale for 40$ before buying it. 

How is that not frugal?

&gt;Nobody who's actually frugal out of necessity is going to buy a $150 sweater that looks exactly like one you can get on the sale rack at the Nordstrom outlet for $30. Or a Goodwill in the nice part of town for $10.

When I spend more on something it's because I couldn't find a cheaper alternative *that suit my need*, either at a fast fashion outlet or second hand

If I buy a $60 tee over a 5$ walmart one, the difference will be a superior cut, design and better material &amp;  construction. And the first tee wont look like shit after going into the wash a few times

Also keep in mind that higher end products are usually made in first world countries, that alone should help you understand why they're more expensive.

But this is a decision *I* make because *I* want and can afford to, I mean you wont see me buying a 500$ even if it's better than a 100$ one because the difference *isn't worth it to me* while the one between a $60 tee and a 5$ is"

Clips are a one time little piece of metal that wraps around the ammo and then is discarded after use.

luculentlady,Divorce,1389111956.0,"While these may seem like good quotes I have a little issue with them. The first one makes you feel like there is -nothing- you can do, you'll lose either way. That kind of thinking is self-defeating and never helps! Instead, why not say something like ""Sometimes, you can make no mistakes (in your point of view) and do everything right (in your point of view) and still lose."" This is because it is impossible to make NO mistakes at all...even if you think you made no mistakes, you still made at least one in someone elses opinion and you're better off asking what they think you did wrong then CHOOSE to either accept their opinion as constructive criticism or not. 

The other quote I just don't like at all because it assumes that you have to find the right person in order to be happy. The fact is, the other person doesn't matter all that much. It's not about finding the right person to love, it's about loving the person you've already got. 

My mentor told me this story when I confronted him with the same thought while dealing with my marital problems: 

A man wants to move to new town so he goes to the town sage and asks him, ""What are the people like in this town?"" So the sage asks him, ""What are the people like in the town you come from?""  So the man says, ""The people there are horrible, they're mean, they lie, cheat, and steal."" So the sage tells him, ""Well, the people in this town are like that as well.""  Another man comes to the same town and talks to the same sage and tells him, ""I'm thinking about moving to this town, what are the people like here?"" So the sage asks him, ""What are the people like in the town you're from?"" So the man says, ""Oh they're wonderful. They're great neighbors, friendly, honest, reliable and I love that town."" So the sage tells him, ""The people in this town are like that as well.""

So the moral of it is that it's not about the people, it's about you. "

C_Terror,magicTCG,1389112141.0,"Archangel is too slow for G/W aggro; she's probably more for mid range. If you really want to run her, put her in the SB. (I personally have Trostani in place of her in the SB). 

For the rest of your MB;

2x Banisher priest is probably enough, you can SB the other two (or have Celestial Flares/Last Breaths/Glare of Heresys, depending on your meta). Honestly she's only good against MonoU decks; mono black and RDW wrecks her. G/R usually has a couple burn spells as well.

Your 3x Chronicles should be in favour of Loxodon. I know the card advantage is nice, but the 4 power puts it out of burn range, and hits so much harder.

Make Fleecemane a 4 of, definitely. 

Mistcutter Hydra is good later on in the game when you need to use your mana on something, but I'd run 2x.

I'm not a HUGE fan of Scooze, just because it's more midrangy than aggro. I'd run 3-4 Boon Satyrs over it. The instant flash and anti board wipes is just too good to ignore.

If you run SotP, run 4.

You need maybe 23 lands in this deck, 25 is over kill.

You need 4 Selesnya Charms, 4 Advent of the Wurms, and either 2-4 God's Willing or Rootborn defences. 2 Ajani is often enough. 

Also, unflinching courage is GOD like and is highly underrated. It steam rolls RDW and G/R. A courage on a monstrous lion is unbeatable for almost all decks too. 

Here's the GW list I run (With good results)

4x Experiment One

4x Fleecemane Lion

4x Loxodon Smiter

3x Boon Satyr

2x Trostani

4x Selesnya Charm

4x Advent of the Wurm

4x Call of the Conclave

4x Rootborn Defences

4x Unflinching Courages.

Due to budgetary restrictions, I'm missing Ajanis and VoR (will replace the 4 CotC, and 2 Rootborn Defences). Even with the nerf, this deck is posting pretty good numbers at my local FNM.

danielbearh,personalfinance,1389112188.0,"I, too, was also like your son. Truthfully, sometimes it takes living the consequences of bad financial decisions in order to shock people into reality. 

For me, that reality came soon after college. During my schooling, I racked up 1200 in credit care debt, then got a job at an advertising agency. I lost that job due to the economy and being the lowest man on the totem pole. Even though I had around 1200 a month in freelance work, soon I was unable to pay my rent and my balance on my card and had to move back home for 4 months while I found a new job. I realized then that my finances were extremely important to pay attention to.  

There are definitely somethings you could do to prepare your son for his own wake up call. I had a pretty good personal finance education. I took Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University in high school. While his system is basic it still taught me the vocabulary and processes I'd need to feel secure in my financial security.

The second, extremely valuable piece of advice that I got from my family and my mentors in college was to first pay attention to the type of work you do and then find a major that allows you to make money. I'm a creative, big picture idea man with high emotional EQ and shitty ability to work with technical details. In highschool, I thought getting a degree in sociology, psych, or anthropology would be a perfect fit for me. But the more I considered the advice, I decided that a career in creative advertising was great balance of fulfilling work and at least the potential to find a job that paid me a comfortable wage.

I'm now 25, two months into a job making 55k+a percentage of the profits and an additional 18k a year in freelance work. I'm moving into my dream loft today, actually. I have one month of living expenses in the bank and will have another 3 months saved by March. I'm not perfectly stable just yet, but I I'll be fine. My debts are paid. 

Dont fret over your kid. Another thing that I wish my parents had done for me that an ex boyfriends parents did for him was make him budget any and all spending money they gave him. It was a simple budget at first (middle &amp; high school.) Instead of just paying for things he need, they gave him the extra money in advance and made him include it in his budget. He hated it as a kid. But now he's the most financially successful out of any of my friends. If you wanted more details about this plan, let me know. "

redditerrrr,math,1389112343.0,"Finally, after how many years on reddit?  My moment to shine!  I was a wedding cake decorator in college while getting my math degrees :)

I would highly suggest not using store bought icing if you plan to pipe (write/draw) anything.  You can ice the cake in store bought icing if you prefer, but it would make a huge difference if you make the decorating icing yourself (check out Wilton for a [basic buttercream recipe](http://www.wilton.com/recipe/Buttercream-Icing)).

I have done several XKCD style cakes and they always turn out nicely.  The style is super easy since they are stick figures in black on a white background.  One design idea is a simple stick figure writing the equation of your choice on a blackboard.  If you are doing an 8"" round cake, you may only have room for something simple like 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 or 3^3 = 27.  You could add a longer formula around the side of the cake as well.  Or do only the formula on the side with Happy Birthday on the top with candles.

I would suggest these simple tools to make life much easier for you.  For just a few bucks you can greatly improve the look of your cake.

[Disposable piping bags](http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?sku=pg_disposablebags) - cut the tip off and slip on the coupler and tip.

[Coupler to hole the tip on](http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?sku=pg_couplers) - these are reusable, just wash well in warm soapy water when you are done

[#4 piping tip](http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?sku=418-4) - this is the most basic tip you can find.  EVERY decorator has several #4s.  You can use them to draw, write, or just about anything.  They are basically a pencil for a cake.  Also reusable and immensely useable.

[Star tip](http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?sku=418-32) - this is used for the shell borders of a cake.  Simply adding a shell border ([technique here](http://www.wilton.com/technique/Shell)) at the top and bottom of your cake makes a huge visual difference.  The borders make a cake look pulled together and polished.

Good luck, if you have any questions, I am happy to help!  "

I'm completely 100% in support of gay marriage but seeing as how there's a plethora of married male/female couples in stable homes looking to adopt, I firmly believe we should get those children in the system a mother and a father. I think being given the best home possible when you're adopted is a right. I think wanting kids as a gay couple would be a desire, not a right. So it depends on if you define adopting a child as a right. I don't, but I know some would want to."

If you're not OK with it, then that's your personal preference and you have every right to be upset by it. However, it is a bit naive and unrealistic to expect him to suddenly adopt your personal preference on the matter as well.

The way I see it, you have two choices - Spend your time constantly living in his past, or live in his present. One of these choices represents a realistic future with him. The other doesn't. Take your pick.

1. Send a POST request via AJAX to `http://www.morninghead.com/api/open/AddToCart?crumb=bc296b40c9` (not sure what `crumb` means).  This tells SquareSpace which product and qty to add.
2. That AJAX request sets a cookie called `CART`, which is the shopping cart ID
3. The JavaScript then redirects the user to `https://secure.squarespace.com/commerce/checkout?cartId=52cc29c8e4b04d2b6dfee201`, where that last bit is the cart id from #2 above.

Here's a screenshot of Chrome's dev tools showing those HTTP requests: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/449877/tmp/morninghead.png

Because the add-to-cart action uses a POST request, a direct URL is not possible.  However, you could create a simple page (maybe `www.morninghead.com/buy-now` or something) which emulates that 3-step process with JavaScript.  The JS on `/buy-now` would submit a similar AJAX request and redirect the user to the cart page, just like SquareSpace does with their JavaScript.

On one hand, the Poseidon MK VI has double redundancy and constantly self-calibrates while in use in order to know within seconds if a sensor is drifting off of its calibration (and is then corrected) or has stopped working, or if water has gotten into a part of the loop it's not supposed to.

Then, in the other corner, is the Inspiration CCR with the Vision control system.  Vision has two of everything except the O2 sensors, of which it has three.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389112945.0,"Bynum prioritizes a lot of things over basketball. Do you respect that about him?

In a weird way, I'm kind of split over both the circumstances surrounding Bynum *and* the circumstances surrounding Parker.  On one hand I can totally relate to having a lot more important priorities than my job.  On the other hand, I don't make millions of dollars or serve as an inspiration for a group of fans. 

When you declare for the NBA draft, you're making a big commitment. In exchange for millions of dollars and the opportunity to play basketball for a living, you're expected to entertain fans and ultimately help a team win games.  For a lot of good and meritable reasons, you're expected to make sacrifices.

If Parker is able to maintain his faith without jeopardizing his commitment to the team and his fans, then I'm not at all bothered by his statement.  If his faith gets in the way of basketball, I think it's unfair of him to enter the draft without making it resoundingly clear that his basketball could suffer because of his other priorities (regardless of what those priorities are).

Not driving a self-driving car, on the other hand, isn't just a convenience. It's something that'll cut down deaths on the road dramatically. In the US alone, there's 43,000 deaths and 2.9 million injuries on the road each year. Self-driving cars won't prevent 100% of them, but they'd certainly prevent 95%+.
  
I don't think manually driven cars will be banned in the US, at least, not this half of the century. Let's face it, the US is backwards on lots of social issues, it's all about the economy and ""freedoms' at the expense of human lives and poverty.  
  
In more humane countries, I can definitely see it happening. It wouldn't happen instantly, but once self-driving cars are affordable then buying *new* manually driven cars will be banned, and maybe 10 years later manually driven cars will be completely banned. Some form of subsidy would likely be provided to people in lower income+assets situations.

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389113035.0,"I think the creators of these games are heavily influenced by Karl Marx. It's impossible to not see it in the first and second game. But in Infinite it takes a different approach. It examines the class structure by one that is not wealth based, but religiously and racially based. Ironically, since this game takes place about twenty years before the first games, it takes it's message from twenty years after the first games, where neo-marxism started being implemented at class warfare of all kinds. Young vs. Old, Man vs. Woman, White vs. PoC, religious vs. Agnositic/Atheist; they can all be examined by an adaptation of Marx.

If we choose this standpoint, however, we will find that Marx was strictly egalitarian. He believed that as long as classes exist, there will be discord. He foresaw the victims, the underclassed, rising to power to victimize another class, justifying it with the hardships of what they once went through.

This is what I see in the Vox Populae. An underclass revolution, seeking to overthrow an unfair regime with their own injustice.

I would also point out that this is my reasons for being in TiA. I believe that if we do not thoroughly examine the motives of both rulers and oppressed, we will never escape the cycle. Only by deconstructing dichotomies, applying mercy to past actions, and embracing egalitarianism will we be able to be harmonious.

I am idealistic. If I can't sway enough people to do that, I will be sure that my class is not the one that loses out.

edit: I'd also point out that this take is further backed up by the end of the game."

The battery lasts about thirty min to an hour depending on how often and strongly you vape, and with every blu cart you buy you only get about 80% out of it that you should.

Compare that to my mvp v2 with a protank 2, it might be large but I can vape all day and not worry about refilling anything."

My partner and I are kinky, and our social circle is very open/poly-friendly. The girl we're dating now is from that social circle (though we did not know her prior to dating). 

We (and friends) have also had luck using online sites. OKCupid works pretty well if you can deal with the crap that comes with it. If you're kinky, collarme is okay, but ditto on the crap.

The hardest thing is finding someone interested in BOTH of us TOGETHER. If that is what you want, you have to be clear about it up front, and be prepared for many people whom you (or your partner) might otherwise date, to be not interested in pursuing something."

IntellegentIdiot,loseit,1389113396.0,"It's an over simplification, in truth. I'd expect the media to spread that sort of thing but not a dietitian.

For every 3500 cals you eat you gain 1lb, that much is true. A year is 365 days so if you ate an additional 10cals a day that'd be 3650 cals a year and eating an additional 100cals a day would be 36,500 just over 10lbs. 

However it's not that simple. As you gain weight your metabolism increases so you're burning more calories each day too. As a result, after gaining 9lbs your only eating 45cals or so more than your burning, so going from 9lbs to 10lbs gained would take at least 77 days (77*45=3465cals). Going from 8lbs to 9lbs gained would be 67days. You'd gain 8lbs in your first year and then 2lbs in the next 6months after which you wouldn't gain any more weight.

TL;DR you might gain 10lbs but it'd take you years. You'd only gain 10lbs a year if you adjust your intake so that it was 100 cals more than you were burning"

piratelibrarian,infp,1389113500.0,"""Tempestuous"" is the word I'd use. Shortly after my younger sister was born one of my parents (I cannot recall which) said ""finally, a real baby who NEEDS us."" I shit you not. I was also kind of revered as the reincarnation of my mum's younger sister who died when she was two years old. Weirdness abounded, sometimes that weirdness tended toward the idyllic (when my mum's parents looked after me, my bedtime ritual was a horse-drawn sleigh or buggy ride under a buffalo robe) sometimes toward the nightmarish. 

I was allotted a lot of independence at a young age, to a point where I couldn't conceive that people worried about me so I'd take off and do whatever while my poor fam had search parties out for me because I could have been anywhere within 10 county roads simply because I was comfortable with the terrain.

My dad and I talk and laugh a lot about my shite behaviour as a child. My mum can't really reconcile it and feels badly and always needs to try to rescue/analyse me (huzzah for an education in psychology?) I didn't mean to be a shithead. I was just, and still am, a curious kid.

silverionmox,europe,1389113550.0,"&gt; Uh, what is the working class? If you refer to the lowest income individuals they neither pay the highest percentage of taxes or a big chunk of the total taxes. In sweden the heavy tax burden is carried by the middle class (which is also the biggest demographic group) and the companies ""loyal"" or stupid enough to stay with their headquarters in sweden.

So, the people who actually do something useful, rather than the people who get their income from owning stuff (those classes can overlap).

&gt;Capital gains are taxed together with your income, for companies its at 30% (actual gains from rents and interests would be taxed at the same level).

That 30% is significantly lower than the tax on personal income. And that's just the nominal tax rate. How much is the *effective* tax rate? Here in Belgium it's nominally also 30%, but effectively it's just 5%.

&gt;Please dont try to make it sound like sweden isnt top 3 every year in the highest total tax extraction from the private sector to the state. We also have one of the highest gini scores in the world.

The dog owner should take a piece of clothing that has been worn for at least a day, so their scent can be detected. Go to the location where the dog was lost and leave the article of clothing there (might also want to leave a note not to move it). Come back the next morning (or check intermittently) and hopefully your dog will be waiting near article of clothing. I didn't believe it myself, I figured he was long gone after being lost for almost 2 weeks, but he was waiting there!

fnredditacct,relationships,1389114029.0,"Working on this might feel overwhelming, but don't beat yourself up about having this problem. Many people have trouble being vulnerable.

I think there could be two approaches to this. 

(1) *the riskier approach but with possibly the higher, more immediate payoff* 
Pick one of the two biggies you listed, either the jaw issue, or Buddhism, and tell your parents. Whatever their reaction is, that's going to be ""as bad as it gets"" and everything else should go easier from there. Or at least you'll know it can't get worse. 

To actually accomplish it: Practice saying it out loud. A lot. The exact same sentence. Again and again and again. Then picture yourself in front of them, at their house, wherever it is likely to happen, and say it. And do that, dozens of times. 

Then set a time to meet them you can't back out of. Continue practicing saying it, over and over and over. It'll pop out of your mouth almost all on its own when you get there. Then it's out there, and even if you can't discuss it further at that time, you'll still see their reactions. Still get the ""worse case scenerio"" effect.

(2) *the less risky, but lengthy approach*
Start with people that don't matter. Tell them the things you have a hard time sharing with people that do matter. For example, pick something you have a hard time talking about, and tell a complete stranger. Their reaction might suck and be uncomfortable, but then you get to walk away and never see them again. No consequences. Slowly up the topic ante, and get comfortable saying more and more personal things out loud to people. 

By doing this, trial and error, you could also learn how to phrase things in such a way that it doesn't produce a ""shock"" reaction in others.

This will help you to become comfortable just saying these things out loud to another human being. When that act itself doesn't present as much an issue, then moving on to a non-stranger shouldn't feel quite as scary.

Use the same ""practice saying out loud"" thing I gave up above for (2) as well.

I think that's a bit more of a ""how to,"" anyway.

Mzsickness,AdviceAnimals,1389114108.0,"It has happened a few times. 

One was in the 5th grade with a girl I had a crush on. I'd always catch her staring at me when I'd glace over. Later her friends came up to me after noticing over the weeks and asked if I liked her. I asked why and they said she talked about wanting to hang out with me or go to a movie. I said I would gladly go and then the girls started laughing and yelling to everyone in the commons--which was 150 5th graders waiting for the next class--that I wanted to marry her.

This was really odd to me since I had very good success in having ""girlfriends"" in kindergarten through the 3rd grade. They weren't my girlfriends, but we were rather mutual crushes that would hang out at recess.

So when the girls started going through puberty early they started playing more games. Which raised my guards.

Then next time I remember was when I was in the late 5th grade. I had a crush on a different girl. Her friends came up to me and passed me notes asking if I liked anyone or if I wanted a girlfriend. I'd answer them and then finally I got a note asking if I wanted to date girl named X. I said I would and they brought it back to the girl and they all started laughing.

This point I'm like, what the fuck?

The next time was in the 6th grade. This is where shit starts to get real. We were at an after school event and I was with my five American football friends playing in the gym. A girl (same one from the conference call, but that happened after/later) came over to tell me something. 

They said girl Y wants to talk to me by the vending machines, which was a ways away. So I walk through the half-lit school to the machines and there was the other 2 girls and the girl I had a crush on. They proceed to probe me asking flirtatious questions. I raise my guard because I'm sick of this game, but they seem overly flirtatious. They're grabbing me and touching me trying to tickle me. I start resisting and they shove me between the vending machines and I'm stuck between a wall, 2 machines, and 3 girls.

They keep asking me about who I like and if I'd date anyone. They finally ask me if I liked girl Y and I said yes to get them to stop. The immediately start laughing and run off. The next day it's all over school.

Are you fucking serious?

The next time was in the 7th grade where the girls who tickled/harassed me between the vending machines called me at my home phone. It was a friend of girl Y but I didn't know girl Y was on the line with 2 other girls.

The friend asks me more probing questions. Making me play stupid games like guess who likes me. Then when I said I thought I liked girl Y I heard an uproar of laughter from multiple girls on the phone.

Next day at school it was already known by the time I walked in. People were talking about how I said I liked girl Y over the phone.

Now I'm fucking sick of the games and I never ask or even flirt with another girl until freshman year of college.

As I've mentioned before, they're Marxists, so what they really want is to force everyone who disagrees with them to shut up. But unlike the more conventional red-banner, hammer-and-sickle Marxists, they lack organizational skills and a revolutionary vanguard to actually go out and shoot people. Many of them seem to think that fuming on tumblr about ""male privilege"" and ""rape culture"" will make us all go away.

We humans have always differentiated ourselves from other animals, pursuing creative activities like drawing our hunts on cave walls to building useless things like the Eiffel Tower. Another way we think we like to differentiate ourselves is in our existential questions. I know I am here, buy why &amp; how? I think intelligent people find solace when they discover other people asking the same questions. Life is no longer a struggle for food, water and shelter, but for meaning.

All our creative and intellectual pursuits, comes from this existential awareness. It's what makes us human. It's human to be aware, and be sad, but it's also human to find some ray of light through it all, and to share those feelings - despair and wonder - with others, through art, music, and literature, and sometimes over coffee, and sometimes over reddit.

That's a bit of a complicated question. I was raised in a Christian home and taken to church/indoctrinated into Christianity more or less since birth. So it became my default position, and in a way, I probably believed. I know there were times that I felt I believed. 

As for losing whatever form of faith I might have had, I think it happened when I moved away from home, stopped going to church regularly, and started to examine why I believed - I found I really didn't. I realized that I only ever was sort of going along with Christianity because it had been the normal background of everything in my home life. I thought about how arbitrary and contradictory the Bible and God are. I thought about how absurd all the other religions appeared to be, and how the one I'd been raised with was really no less absurd if I looked at it objectively. 

I decided that there are probably no gods (as nearly everything attributed to gods has a more likely scientific explanation). But (perhaps a reverse form of Pascal's Wager?) if there is/are god/s, if they are so unreasonable as to require blind faith, punish infinitely for finite sin, declare everyone sinners at birth, etc, I want nothing to do with them, but otherwise, they are probably ok with me using the mind I was born with to reason about the nature of life and the universe.

[Here is a picture of it with no targets stapled to it.](http://i.imgur.com/FcRzy81) I just staple targets directly to it and leave 'em up and staple new ones over 'em.

For awhile, I was concerned with ricochets, but it's a non-issue. Even piss-ant .22's bury themselves into the wood.

Overall I'm pleased with it - it's small and tidy - but in retrospect I'd shelled out more $ and not cut the ties, and fill all the way to the ground.

Oh my, **All-New X-Factor** is coming this week. I can’t express how excited I am. Peter David and Gambit and Danger and… this book is going to be stellar.

**Sex Criminals** is a close second for excitement. The more I think about this book the more I love it. It’s such a punch in the teeth with realistic ignorance and shenanigans that I can’t help but love it with every issue I read.

Then near perfection in a comic books arrives: **Marvel Knights: Spider-Man**. This may be one of the best mini-series I’ve ever read and it’s not even finished yet. Matt Kindt is killing it and artist Marco Rudy Teixeira Retagi is a god.

Finally, **Young Avengers**. We’re closing up here real quick and I’m okay with it. Kieron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie’s run has been fun. I’m not sure what the point was, but it was fun.

Otherwise, they may fall into despair (too soon IMO) that it won't last forever. Which is of course a consequence of unwholesome craving. But, can a child *really* have an insight into unwholesome craving?

I would say if I was raising my kid Buddhist, I would stick to teaching them about Amida, moral conduct, karma, and merit. This is all hypothetical because I don't even want to have kids, but it's interesting to think about these challenges."

-Throwing knife right at the bottom edge kills

-Direct impact from grenade launcher.

-Using your own shield to block c4

""God and the soldier we honour, when war is raging and they stand for us.

But when peace reigns and the platters are full, we forget god and despise the soldier.""

Loosely translated. Most people will beg for help when they need it but won't remember the help they got afterwards. I have often tried to explain that the US pulling their troops from Europe wasn't exactly a good thing since they were a guarantee for peace and stability for us but most hippies don't have the IQ to understand something as complex as international relations. They rather believe in puppies and pot than understand that trade and might is what guarantees our precious peace.

But it is also important to distinguish people from people because most of the people who were against Libya were also against any involvement in Syria. I would even argue that some people who were for the Libya mission were against involvement in Syria because of their alliance with the Russians (We do not want to start a global nuclear war over some piece of shit real estate in the middle of the desert!)"

naveedx983,ADHD,1389114899.0,"Similar to a lot of people sharing their experiences, mine has a lot to do with losing focus or motivation for something i'm really excited a bout.

* Hobbies
* Diet
* Gym time
* Sleeping at decent time
* Keeping my place clean
* Shaving consistently

It's like for the first few days I'm all gung ho about something, I can spend a lot of time and energy on it, and suddenly it's like that fire that drives you just goes away.  I get bored of tracking my calories, or I talk myself out of the gym today, or I jump in bed to sleep on time but end up on my ipad for 3 hours.

It's really frustrating because people see me as lazy, and I'm not, when my heart is in it I go all in on something, but my heart doesn't stay in anything for more than a few days or weeks.  

Hobbies have become frustrating, dropped like a grand on camera equipment and nice things for that and I did it for a while, surprisingly over a year which is a long time for me.  I thought I may have really found something I was passionate about and put time in to, and suddenly, it's like a switch is flipped and I can't even be bothered to take my camera on a road trip.

I think my ADHD makes me the quintessential yo yo dieter as well.  I can swing 30 lbs in a month, and then a weekend wedding or something and boom, off the wagon, lose all progress, something else is coming up and I need to fit in my suit again, ok start the extreme diet once again.  People talk about lifestyle changes for diet and exercise, and I am just incapable of them, it's frustrating and sad to me, but it also really reflects poorly on me to others."

Diguiseppimon,ADHD,1389115076.0,"Honestly, as someone who had ADHD as a kid, watched my brother have other types of hyperactive/crazy disorders, and me being the one to carry the ADHD into adulthood, this is my opinion: Stop medicating your fucking kids. A good majority of the children that are 'diagnosed' with ADHD don't really have it, they are just being kids. We live in a country where being slightly 'off', even for a second, makes you not normal, and you need a pill to fix that. Sure, some kids definitely DO have ADHD, but from what I have seen with personal experience, and getting to know many different kids/adults that have it, or another type of mental disorder, will not show really bad signs until they are much older. The hyperactive part is not the issue. It's the attentive part. And sadly, most people can't really get proper treatment until they are adults. Quite frankly, all the kids that are high school/college age, only take meds to focus better for their finals. When you get into the real world and have a job that you can't do, or can't even clean, or cook, or anything because you start 83 projects at once and cant remember where you put your cleaning supplies, etc, do you realize how badly you really needed it. It's all a case by case basis, but really, people need to spend time on the subject with their kids, and not jump to the immediate conclusion that they have ADHD. 


Tl;dr--most kids aren't add, they are just hyper, cuz they're fucking kids. Most college kids don't need meds, they are just trying to stay awake and pass their exams. Those who really need it, are pretty fucking obvious, and most will not get proper help til they are adults, when it really sucks to deal with. "

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389115203.0,"We'll need to reform the tax system to get a decent basic income to work though. My own rough, perfect world plans range from $10k at 32% tax, to $15k at 40% tax. Anything under $10k just doesn't seem worth it to me, and ideally, I'd like to see $12-15k (this also assumes only adults get it, which is part of the reason for the somewhat generous amount). 

I just seems silly to give people money only to take it away via taxation. 

My own plan would be like, as follows in practice. Say we do the $15k / 40% plan. Someone making $30k a year would pay $12,000 in taxes and recieve a $15k UBI. Someone making $200,000 a year would pay $80k in taxes and get the same $15k UBI.

The $30k person has a -10% effective tax, the $200k person has a 30something% effective tax. The more money you make, the more you get taxed, and the more gets clawed back via taxation. Under that particular plan, the break even point would be $37,500 for a single person and $75,000 for a married couple/household income (since they're two adults with two UBIs). Heck, normally flat taxes are seen to put more burden on the poor, which is why we have a progressive tax, but with UBI, a flat tax is a way of clawing back the benefits when you work."

25tolife_,AskMen,1389115243.0,"I can see both perspectives here. You're feeling hurt merely because you want to feel special to this guy, and with him sleeping with so many women you don't want to end up as just another tally mark.

But.

The guy told you how many women he had slept with, which while that isn't a small number, at least he was honest with you (I doubt he would tell a woman he had interest in that he had slept with that many women as a lie). And if you're wanting to be special to him, and you're saying that he appears as an emotional and sensitive guy, then he's *probably* trying to make you feel special in one form or another. It's not like he's a serial killer, and therefore it shouldn't really matter what he had done *before* he met you, you should focus on accepting him for who he is at the moment you met him and forward.

And lastly...

&gt; ""WHAT DO YOU EXPECT, I am 32"" **blah blah** ... and that I need to find myself a virgin, if that's what I want, **wah wah wah**. 

What this tells me is that you're not even fully listening to his responses to your questions about his life previous to you, even though he was honest with you ~~from the beginning~~. It sounds to me like you may have some insecurities of your own, and instead of focusing on something you consider to be a huge flaw on him, you should talk with him and come to some sort of an understanding that is fair to both of you.

&gt; But Hey... are **ALL GUYS** like that? Sleeping around when Single and no need for emotional connection when having sex??

If I had a nickel for every time I heard a woman use the ever-so-popular ""all guys"" phrase, Bill Gates would be my personal assistant.

**Edit:** After reading through the comments and seeing a few your responses, I see that he didn't want to tell you right away. Maybe he had a feeling you would react this way, regardless of whether he had told you in the very beginning or not? It appears that he's showing you that he cares about you... if it doesn't work out there's other fish in the sea, but don't take too long to think about it or yes, he will walk."

wombative,nonmonogamy,1389115303.0,"I (f) am fairly out about being in an open kinky relationship. 

First, I think it is important to recognize that a lot of negativity comes from oneself--we are enculturated to believe that monogamy is the One True Way, and it can be difficult to free oneself from the shame and ""wrongness"" of doing something different. Often, people say things without thinking, and it may not be their intent to be negative or disapproving--they just don't know what to say or are just blurting something out, which doesn't make it right, but there it is--but because they're not being all ra! ra! positive, it is all too easy to hear their comments as something negative, because we secretly feel that way ourselves, a little bit.

I'm not saying that this is what is happening to you. I'm just pointing out that it happens, and it is useful to recognize that we are constantly placing value judgments on ourselves, and, as a result, reinforcing other people's value judgments on us.

So, what do I do when someone negatively questions or comments on my relationship? If it's someone I'm not interested in actually educating (either because I just can't be bothered or I don't think they actually care to know), I'll just give them the smuggest fucking grin they ever saw, and say nothing. I don't defend myself to haters, and I don't take their bait. 

If it's someone I think I can actually have some kind of exchange with about it, I'll usually start by turning the question back on them. Why *wouldn't* I be in an open relationship? This gives me an idea about why they're asking, and I can more easily address their ""concerns."" It also lets them know I'm open to dialogue about it, and that I'm not going to get defensive.

edited to add: One thing you and/or your gf can do is try to surround yourself with positive messages about your kind of relationship. Listen to/read Dan Savage. Check out the Polyamory Weekly podcast. Read blogs. Find supportive friends/community. That helps a lot in countering negative messages coming from elsewhere.

When you don't do that and you're saddled with 2 inches of ice caked on every side of your old Ford F-150 (as I was here in Arkansas in 2008) take a sturdy knife and chip in around the edges of the door against the frame of the vehicle.

The origional blogger seems to be making an assumption that because he/she didn't personally get to go through every document, than they must have contained super-valuable information that someone is trying to hide.  Conspiracy theories are fun, I guess.  It's good to hear from an actual archival professional.

Not everything is important just because it's on old paper, and those suggesting that everything be digitized, think for a moment of the costs involved.  If you want that, I'm sure most archives would appreciate the massive funding it would take.  Know also, that digitizing documents is great for access, but very poor for permanent records retention.  If any of you have ever deleted a file from your computer, think of why you did that instead of retaining it.  Then you'll at least have a rudimentary understanding of how archives must operate."

Next time he tries it, or even before, just tell him all gifts have to go through you for approval as you're the primary caregiver.  If he gives you problems, tell him clearing up the back child support will allow him to give them whatever he wants.

On the other hand, I had divorced parents.  I know what it's like to have a dad who's not around want to win your affections.  A lot of times the only way they know how is to buy you things.  We got a lot of Atari games and Transformers that way.  Maybe instead, suggest he take the money he would have spent on things and maybe use it to plan some events (agreements withstanding.)  Take them on a trip, go to a theme park, allow them to plan a big party with their friends.  Spend the money to make some quality time instead of just throwing things at them.

Also, and maybe not as popular opinion.  The odds are, that if you're in a long marriage, you'll have kids.  (We have 2.)  If you do, make sure and make time for the 2 of you.  I'm not saying you should ignore them or anything like that.  But you have to continue to work on your relationship.  Think of it in these terms, eventually, hopefully, your children will move out.  If you've spent the last 18-20+ years focusing only on the children, your relationship with your spouse is likely to atrophy.  Once they are gone, it may be too late to put things back together.  

We both believe this is the reason for some of the divorces that occur in the 20+ year range of a marriage.  The kids move out, and the husband and wife are left looking at each other thinking, ""Who's that stranger?  I don't love them any more.""  

Both of our kids still live at home.  However, we take trips with just the two of us.  We do ""staycations"" while they are in school, sometimes.  We both have a hobby (powerlifting) that we participate together.  We're not ignoring our children, but we are giving the health of our relationship equal weight."

A problem with that is having a woman as p4p champion is off putting to the latent or not so latent sexism of a sport with a male-centric fan base that's heavily concerned with idealized images of masculinity like mma, so many would be hesitant to use that criteria. MMA used to be about finding the best fighter on the planet but that business model isn't as lucrative as hyping up weight-class champions so more product can be sold, so it leaves this conundrum of debating fighter A from one weight class vs fighter B of another and it opens up these debates of magical fantasy like if both fighters were equal in size who would win or whatever.

Pachacamac,AskHistorians,1389115755.0,"Ok, got that's clearer. I think that most Andeanists would argue that the actual conquest was a matter of the Spanish playing politics, not technology. Had the initial conquest failed, they would have returned, and technology probably would have played a greater role then, but as it is, even with horses and muskets, there were only 130 or so Spanish who arrived with Pizarro in Peru, facing well-trained and experienced Inca armies who could throw a bola stone with precision at your head from far away. 

The Inca Empire was undergoing a civil war when Pizarro arrived, and he managed to play this to his advantage. He was also helped by the fact that the Inca really didn't know what to make of these men and their horses. It also helps that Pizarro came to Peru 40 years after Columbus had arrived in the Caribbean, and the Spanish diseases had spread throughout the continent in those decades, killing huge numbers of people. But there were still millions of people living in the Andes, and the empire was still well-organized.

So basically you had the civil war, and Pizarro drove a wedge between the two factions, Atahualpa and his half-brother Huascar. Pizarro captured Atahualpa and ransomed him for a room filled once with gold and twice with silver, and then killed Atahualpa anyway. Pizarro then marched on to Cuzco, but I don't remember the exact details or just how he managed to conquer the capital so quickly.

Also important was the fact that the Inca had only begun to expand some 80 years before Pizarro arrived, and the Inca had rapidly conquered a lot of land--some peacefully, some violently--and had not really had much time to consolidate the empire. This meant that Pizarro encountered a lot of people who remembered being conquered by the Inca, and were resentful of that. So he was able to get some allies on board to take over Cuzco. Unfortunately this history is not my specialty, and I don't remember just how it all played out, but by 1534 (two years after arriving in Peru) Pizarro had captured Cuzco.

There was also an indigenous rebellion a few decades later led by Tupac Amaru that tried to kick the Spanish out, and as I understand it they were almost successful, but obviously were ultimately defeated. But this is getting into the realm of Peruvian history, and I'm not very familiar with that.

In sum, I would say that technology played little role because sure, they had superior technology from a purely strategic perspective, but the Spanish faced huge, experienced armies. But Pizarro played political rifts within the Inca empire off of each other and that's how he was really successful."

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389115783.0,"You'd be surprised. There are quite a few libertarians on /r/basicincome and there normally a lot more chill than the ones we make fun of on this subreddit. 

I know I had a libertarian explain his position a while back asking why libertarians support basic income, and it had something to do with them recognizing getting rid of government is a pipe dream so let's simplify our welfare system into a lump payment and let the free market take care of it from there. I then get in a fight with them over the necessity of a minimum wage in a UBI based society (I'd be tentatively for keeping it until we evaluate UBI's effects, and then discuss the issue, liberatarian supporters of basic income wanna get the income out there then take away minimum wage, which could, in effect, just be a way for businesses to allow the government to subsidize cheap labor by shifting the costs to them IMO...you know, like how min wage workers currently have to live on food stamps already and all). 

So in short, it's because they compromise with reality and recognize anarcho capitalism is a pipe dream and we'll always have government, so let's at least make it small and efficient by streamlining welfare into basic income, and then allowing the free market to do the rest of the job. The downside is many libertarians would then support massive deregulation of the private sector, and would approach of things such as getting rid of the minimum wage entirely, before we even evaluate its necessity in a post-basic income society.

There's also a site out there written by an intelligent libertarian that explains it. I can't find it though, it's called like ""freemoneyforall.org"" or something like that.

Is the relevant part. Do these things. And fer fuxsake, don't plug it into your laptop unless you built the thing, and know exactly what load you're putting on that port, and what it can handle.

devilsplaythang,explainlikeimfive,1389115886.0,"i wash my hair everyday too and i have very healthy, waist length hair too. my hair gets oily very quickly and my hair rarely looks presentable a day after washing. my hair looks very flat at the roots when dirty. im blonde and have thin hair, so its very obviously oily. i thought it might be that because i wash it too much that it gets oily easy, so ive experimented and gone days without washing to try to regulate my oil production, but without fail its dirty the day after. so what im getting at is that everyones hair is different. people with dry hair and low oil production would find it damaging to their hair to wash it everyday, but not me."

e-raja,exmuslim,1389115934.0,"It's good to see you being open to questions, this is the healthy approach to acquiring the information you need to make a proper decision.

The first thing you need to ask yourself is why you believe Islam is true?
This is a difficult question to answer and requires a lot of reflection. In the stages of doubt you always try to rationalise blatant mistakes in the doctrine. Cognitive dissonance also plays a part.

I recommend going through all the list of logical fallacies and fallacious reasoning and apply them to the Quran and Sunnah. You'll notice what many of us here eventually realise.

reflect on the following, What benefit does Islam offer that can not be achieved from outside of it?

Also another thing that keeps someone attached to Islam (and Christianity to an extent) is the fear of Hell. Once you see the folly of Islam, the fear of hell takes time to dissipate, It took me half a year to truly let go of that fear. 

You can still believe in a higher power, if it helps you cope with the emptiness you would feel if you got rid of Islam.

Hope this helped somewhat.

The amount of energy you're expending on focusing on the shit in your life could be used to take stock of what you DO have, and what you CAN do, and go from there.

This is the key point: you're offered a limited amount of tax-advantaged ""space"" in retirement accounts over your life; and the ""space"" in retirement accounts that you get early in life is way more valuable than the ""space"" you get later in life.

&gt; Also, and maybe not as popular opinion. The odds are, that if you're in a long marriage, you'll have kids. (We have 2.) If you do, make sure and make time for the 2 of you. I'm not saying you should ignore them or anything like that. But you have to continue to work on your relationship. Think of it in these terms, eventually, hopefully, your children will move out. If you've spent the last 18-20+ years focusing only on the children, your relationship with your spouse is likely to atrophy. Once they are gone, it may be too late to put things back together.
&gt; We both believe this is the reason for some of the divorces that occur in the 20+ year range of a marriage. The kids move out, and the husband and wife are left looking at each other thinking, ""Who's that stranger? I don't love them any more.""
&gt; Both of our kids still live at home. However, we take trips with just the two of us. We do ""staycations"" while they are in school, sometimes. We both have a hobby (powerlifting) that we participate together. We're not ignoring our children, but we are giving the health of our relationship equal weight.

I put my 3DS in my pocket before leaving the house, got into my car to move the car to a better parking spot, then got out of my car to get in my girlfriend's car and left the house.

Now, the weather conditions were: around 25 degrees Fahrenheit and snowing.

We ended up leaving the house for around 6.5 hours, which in the mean time 3"" of snow had fallen.  After getting back home, I couldn't find the 3DS, so I tore apart the apartment, her car, and my car.  The 3DS was nowhere to be found.  I decided to give up and started walking back inside and i saw a corner of my 3DS case sticking out of the snow.  I brought the 3DS case inside, opened it up, and the 3DS was totally fine.  Some of the buttons felt a bit sluggish due to being cold, but it still works great.

I can see where you're coming from if you think this is the right way to run things.

However, if you do feel that strongly about it, you're probably in the minority and I cant see America changing completely to the kind of place where you don't have to be taxed.

If you do feel so strongly about it why don't you move elsewhere? Maybe to a country with no income tax? 

For me America is the best place in the world to live and there's no where I'd rather be. Sure it's not perfect, but I do enjoy it and feel like I have great opportunity here and I'm happy to pay taxes for that opportunity.

Your viewpoint is just that, a view point. Though it is valid, not everyone will share it, and in my opinion only a small minority will share it. I guess I see academically why you would hold that viewpoint so strongly, I'm curious if you think you can effect any sort of noticeable change. 

Thanks again for your time explaining your viewpoint.

Also in the first video ""George out to help."" They talk about physical violence a lot in explaining what will happen to people if they don't pay taxes. In some kind of Orwellian state I could see how that would be true, however they won't shoot you in the head if you don't pay your taxes, they'll just throw you in jail.

1) That women are somehow brainwashed puppets who are unable to make their own decisions and so even when they do, things like consent to sex are somehow not valid.

2) That women often make ""trade-off"" type decisions in who they have sex with, such as for financial reasons in his dumb, meandering rant about marxism and a warped definition of rape. The implication is that this is also not valid consent because they would otherwise not have sex with these guys and would opt to only have sex with guys when there are no financial ulterior motives on their part which raises several philosophical and moral questions in the context of his marxist drivel which he would probably not answer (because it would make him look very stupid), such as, for example...

What motivation would the vast majority percentage of males who don't get chosen for sex (as seen today under ""hookup culture"" where a small percentage of men get almost all of the sex) have to be productive members of his utopian communist society he imagines when they would essentially have the majority of the fruits of the labor taken from them and given to supporting these women and their children by a small percentage of the male population.

God_Wills_It_,cowboys,1389116369.0,"I think it's pretty obvious that's what we need.  The defensive line needs to generate pressure against opposing QBs if the defense is to have any success in today's NFL.  We've seen how quickly our offensive line has turned around because of a couple high draft picks.  It's time to make that same investment in the defense.

We have also seen other teams have dramatic defensive resurgences using their high draft picks on DL.  Last draft the Pathers went DT, DT with Star Lotulelei &amp; Kawann Short.  That revamped line helped them to the 2 seed.  [Also this draft seems be a pretty good one for DL.](http://walterfootball.com/draft2014DT.php)  We still need to see how they all grade out but it looks promising.  Now we just hope that a lot of the QBs grade out well so teams take them at the top of rounds 1 &amp; 2 and allow the best linemen to fall to us.  "

The sex was amazing, the partying was always fun, and I thought she had my fuck all attitude. We would go out a lot party, get drunk and have sex all the time.  I was always someone who enjoyed a good party and she was always down which was cool by my book.  The warning signs started to show when I realized every time we were together is because of some alcohol related event going on in my life.  But the sex was awesome so I ignored those stupid signs.  Well it turns out that fuck all attitude was really a fuck everyone attitude and that woman was fuck of hate and spite. Mixed with alcohol this was just a train wreck waiting to happen.  And boy that crash was one for the record books.  My fuck all attitude did not go well with her slowly showing fuck everyone attitude as nights would get cut short due to some unflattering actions by her.  Inner demons and hate mixed with alcohol and rimmed with crazy got old and the sex wasn't that good for this situation.  I think she lost grasp with reality and couldn't/didn't want to turn off party mode.  We broke up because I expressed concerns about maybe she needed to find some help.  She declined my request and broke up with me.  She ended up dating one of my best friends and now she is his problem.  But damn that was really good sex."

Analog265,soccer,1389116545.0,"&gt;Mata was never given a chance to play. He was injured during preseason and the first few weeks of regular season. He found himself benched after having recuperated. I've watched every Chelsea game this season, and the ones he's gotten into he's done what he's always done - create amazing plays.

He was benched more often because Oscar was playing better, you don't seem to understand this. You might be watching with rose-tinted glasses if you think he has been amazing. This season so far he only has 1 goal and 3 assists, which is pretty shit. Meanwhile Oscar is scoring and assisting regularly. Honestly, Mourinho wouldn't be crazy to bench Mata a little more but no, he continues to give him chances.

Mata hasn't even been a benchwarmer, he's just been rotated. IIRC, he has like 17 appearances under his belt and i think like 14 of them have been starts.

&gt;He deserves to play for a club and a manager that can appreciate his talent and so I hope he goes elsewhere and then leads that club to victory over Chelsea just so I can laugh at Mourinho for not playing him.

Well then you're not a very good fan then. You seem like more of a Mata fan than a Chelsea fan.

&gt;I like Mourinho but fuck him for the way he's treated Mata. Also, I pretty much hate my fellow Chelsea fans because they are so quick to forget what their players have done for them in the past.

Everyone values Mata, but he isn't entitled to a spot just because of how he played last season. Until he's playing better than his competition for the CAM spot, he won't be in that spot, its simple."

I'm not going to say it's bestof material, but Planet Fitness is not designed to cater to enthusiasts.

You can't have that, because then the cash cows walking in the door ready to sign a contract (the ones who pay every month but almost never go) might see something that makes them feel uncomfortable.  So you have to steer that enthusiasm away from the larger fitness universe and into the narrow band of things that look ""normal"" to people who don't actually work out.  Who benefits from that?

DrMantisofPhilly,askscience,1389116667.0,"Hmmm that’s a tough one... I’m not meteorology major, but i have taken a meteorology class so I kind of get some of the processes at work. So a cloud (and in this explanation, assume i am talking about a mass of water vapor in the atmosphere, not even a cloud yet.) forms by a process called adiabatic cooling, which means when the water particles cool in the air, the scrunch in closer to each other, which in turn dumps latent heat (leftover heat energy) from the water vapor mass. This latent heat is actually warmth coming out of the vapor, which in turn pushes the cloud upward...from there it is this constant repeating cycle of Rise, cool/condense, release latent heat, rise again. So that’s how clouds get up there, what makes them go different distances up now relies on other things going on in the atmosphere and the cloud. Like if the cloud has a huge amount of water vapor, and it is really warm, that’s when you tend to get thunderstorms, usually the highest reaching clouds in the atmosphere. But usually some of the higher clouds in the atmosphere are actually ice particles instead of water particles, which might have a different effect on how high it is in the atmosphere (cloud composition on height is something I’m not sure of, maybe someone else can add on to that answer...) but yea I would say it is the 1) conditions in the atmosphere, (if the air is even conducive for forming good clouds) and 2) The amount of water vapor rising up to be the cloud, and how much potential latent heat energy is trapped within it. Because as long as there is still latent heat to be squeezed out of the vapor the cloud is going to rise.

Objectivism is a reaction to Marxism, a defense of the upper class. Or, it's how Neitzche would respond to Marx. Marx expressed a need for the proletariat to have power, and abolish the two class system in favor of one. Neitzche expressed the difference between master and a slave in any system, and expressed how much better it was to be a master. ""A man chooses, a slave obeys."" We clearly see the Neitzche approach in Objectivism with this game, so the developers were certainly aware of this. If the purpose of this game is to prove Rand and Neitzche wrong, wouldn't the option indicate that they feel that Marx, the one these notions were rebelling against, be right? If you see a critique against the conceptual God, would the critique be more indicative of atheism than of religion?

It's a thing that is happening in his own brain which no one can really overcome. 

I would immediately dismiss a man if he spoke that way about the relationships he has had, hopefully this new girl takes the hint and ignores him. I will feel sorry for her if she didn't see that as a red flag and keeps seeing him.

unicornbomb,science,1389116768.0,"&gt; We don't teach bullied kids to analyze their own behavior

I was bullied horribly in high school by a group of junior and senior guys -- these were tall, built dudes who worked on farms. I was a fourteen year old girl who was 5'2 and weighed all of 110 lbs. 

I was very shy and quiet and literally never said a word to these people. I didnt have classes with them, I didnt know them. My only ""mistake"" was dressing a little artsy and dying pink streaks in my hair. In return for this, they would wait outside my second period class everyday to scream obscenities at me, push me into lockers, and grab my books and binder out of my hands and throw them down the hallway or in the trashcan. 

This continued for almost an entire semester before a teacher finally witnessed what was going on and stepped in and got the administors involved and started keeping an eye on the hall between classes. I am so incredibly thankful that he didnt have the attitude you do, and that he took things seriously the first time he witnessed it. Its incredibly disheartening to know there are kids going through the same thing as I did, but treated as if it is somehow their fault that they have been targeted for being too 'weird', socially inept, or whatever.

professor__doom,MechanicAdvice,1389116772.0,"&gt; I did the bounce check on the shocks of my car and it seems fine. 

The old ""bounce test"" is really not a good indicator of shock performance.  It worked fine before modern gas-charged, multistage shocks hit the scene in the 1980s; today it is basically an urban myth, since a shock that fails the ""bounce test"" should have been replaced LONG ago.  From [RockAuto's newsletter](http://www.rockauto.com/Newsletter/archives/5-16-13.html):
&gt;Multistage valves are one reason the old push-down-on-the-fender test for shocks is now almost useless. If the car keeps bouncing after a big push down on the fender, then that means the third stage, big-bump, valve is now worn out, the second stage valve has been worn out for awhile and the first stage valve has been worn out for a really long time. A shock that fails the fender-push test should have been replaced long ago. That shock absorber or strut has not been protecting the vehicle’s suspension parts and assisting with safe vehicle handling and braking.

Shocks are filled with oil, and that oil thins out and deteriorates with every bump as it is forced through a thin orifice.  If your shocks have seen more than 50,000 miles, you really should replace them.  It's not just a question of comfort--it actually saves money in the long run, since bad shocks mean more wear on your suspension/steering components, brakes, tires, and more.

A buddy of mine went WAY too long on old shocks--ended up having to replace both shock mounts, a tie rod end, and an entire control arm.  The car still passed the ""jump on the fender"" test, but you could feel the difference on the road, and the car was making strange noises when turning.

To quote [RockAuto's newsletter](http://www.rockauto.com/Newsletter/archives/41510.html) again:
&gt; At first glance, Monroe’s 50,000-mile replacement recommendation may seem like a ruse to sell more shocks. If you believe that then plan on buying a lot more brake pads, ball joints, springs, CV half shafts, engine mounts, etc. If I broke open my old shocks I would have found the oil inside had deteriorated to black goo. If the shocks are not controlling the motion of the car then expensive suspension, steering, and drivetrain components will be absorbing that energy and wearing out faster. Monroe will sell more of their brake pads [...] if less people replace their shocks.

&gt;I was skeptical myself until I attended a Monroe class and test drive last year. I drove cars equipped with new shocks or struts and then drove identical cars with 50,000 miles on the original shocks and struts. What left the biggest impression was how new shocks made the cars quicker to stop. With old shocks the front of the car too easily sank down and the back too easily rose up putting a disproportionate amount of load on the front brakes. "

I was twenty five, and I worked for a prominent delivery company. We ran packages throughout Nevada and Arizona, some really weird stuff too. So this guy hires my company to send six packages all over. They were some really weird stuff too. I only remember two, a poker chip and a pair of fuzzy dice. I thought something was off about it, but the pay was good and I couldn't afford to turn down the job. I mean, what was the worst that could happen right? 

Anyway, worst comes to worst, and the guy who hired me ends up stealing my package using some hired thugs. Big ugly mother fuckers too, drug runners so far as I know.

I wake up in a Doctor's Office, get patched up, and get into a brawl almost immediately. Needless to say I skip town, with the sole objective of finding this son of a bitch. I catch up with the hired muscle, who as it happens were in a standoff with the local LEOs (Law Enforcement Officers). The LEOs take them in, and I say I won't press assault charges if they tell me where this fucker is. They agree, because they're already going away what the hell do they care. The brains (I use the term lightly) of the bunch tells me he's hiding out in Vegas. Which makes sense. The guy, as near as I could tell, worked for a Casino.

So anyway, I made it to Vegas, and spend the next three months camped outside his casino, watching. Waiting. It's clear he doesn't recognize me, because I sometimes go into the casino and see him walking the floor. Anyway, eventually I manage to talk him into being alone with me. I whip out a silenced twenty two pistol that I managed to smuggle in and put seven in his head. Overkill? Maybe. But that fucker deserved it.

It is a truth that cannot be calculated, and you cannot know him until you take up faith, in the same way a parachutist does not know his parachute will open until he take the leap out of the plane and pulls the ripcord""

HippityLongEars,Magicdeckbuilding,1389116930.0,"I would say that if you take this deck to your FNM, you will not beat other decks. It is okay though!

To make your deck better, choose exactly one of the following packages, which give you a ""plan"" for victory:

* Abhorrent Overlord and Erebos (devotion to black)
* Fanatic of Mogis (devotion to red)
* Anger of the Gods and Demolish (land destruction??)

You need to choose exactly one of those packages because they each conflict with each other. For example, if you cast Anger of the Gods or Demolish, that means you are killing everything and not increasing your devotion to either color, making your devotion cards weaker.

Once you choose one of the packages, go to your local card shop and buy a bunch of cheap cards that go with that plan. Most card shops have binders for things like this and you should be able to build something very sensible!

Honestly, I believe writing on a whiteboard or any vertical surface is the best way to learn proper handwriting anyway. 

In order for your students to read your writing from afar, it must be rather large. Finger-only writing not only writes small, but fatigues the forearm/wrist/hands, especially if you're writing as much as a teacher.

I went through all of the relevant reasoning in my comment above, and I tied it in to builds that give the most fps/dollar at any given price point. To explain how shifting money over to the GPU side of things is damned near always going to be beneficial.

1) The DMR is (or was) overpowered.

If God was to create a new religion and a new holy book, it would be in a language that we understand and are comfortable with; the rules would be exactly the same but just the style of language would be more modern.

It is an oversight on God's part if he didn't realise that languages die out and evolve. I thought God was the best of planners."

captain_craptain,Drugs,1389117438.0,"Hell push it back to 18 like it used to be in the 70's!  I feel like the binge drinking and alcohol abuse in college settings and even High School parties where kids drink way too much and get alcohol poisoning and sometimes die is largely due to the age restriction of 21.  If we let them at it sooner it isn't as big of a deal and they will settle down about it sooner than they are now.  

I was a party animal in High School and college and did these things too, I drank to excess regularly and puked, passed out and did all that shit.  I think if I had been legally allowed to get it at 18 I would have been more mature about it, but I had to learn about it the 'hard' way and I could have been seriously hurt or dead from it.  For example, I knew a guy who went to the Marines right out of High School.  He and his platoon were drinking in the barracks one night before they even deployed for anything and the whole ""Don't be a pussy!  Keep drinking!"" mentality killed him.  He drank to the point of dying...on a military base mind you.  Surely a medic was around somewhere....  

I have hurt myself doing stupid shit on alcohol many times and taken really dumb risks.  I can honestly say that the amount of stupid risks and injuries due to alcohol has decreased exponentially the older I get to the point of I now know my limits and rarely exceed them.  

It's a learning curve with any drugs, especially alcohol. As well all know, a prohibition approach only makes people want to do things more because it is like tasting forbidden fruit.  We need to get rid of the stigma and the D.A.R.E. program because they are a failure."

I could give you some reports though they will be in Swedish, that should have no effect on their credibility however, rather the opposite I believe.

Very mild soaps have little effect and may not do much noticeable damage on all people, however there will be effect and it will be more severe on some people.

The inside of the foreskin produces smegma which is both antibacterial and antifungual and acts to clean the area. Since it's produced constantly though it needs to be removed at regular intervals otherwise it will become saturated with bacteria and it's effectiveness removed. All that is needed for the removal of the saturated smegma is rinsing with warm water and perhaps some physical rubbing with the fingers.

These are national health recommendations from several Swedish doctors with special expertise in the area.

The outside of the penis and surrounding area can be effectively cleaned with soap however, in fact it's very much recommended.

DogOnABike,AskReddit,1389117599.0,"Sounds like the place you're moving may not have a great job market for your field, so it may take a while to find something. You might consider loosening your standards a bit. Look for something that may not be quite what you had in mind, but that's close enough that your skills are still relevant and transferable. Or look farther away from where you'll be living and deal with a long commute.

I'd advise you to look into the forbearance for your student loans, and take a part time job if you don't find something soon. Some income is better than none, and once you do get an interview, ""I relocated with my fiance and I've been waiting tables while looking for a job in my field"" sounds better than ""I haven't worked in six months."" Just don't lose motivation. Your friends that are still working those ""temporary"" jobs probably got frustrated and complacent and stopped putting much effort into finding the job they went to school for."

Tavarish,Games,1389117605.0,"How I have understood is that Rocket basically did basic DayZ mod by himself, on free time and without funding, while working for Bohemia as ArmA developer.

Once mod really took off Bohemia offered to give Rocket small team that can work on DayZ mod and later on SA. Team, as far I know, was rather small and didn't get major funding [manpower] from Bohemia as they were working on ArmA 3 at the time.

Current situation is that DayZ SA, especially now after enormous sales success, is more than likely get more people from Bohemia into team and even hire new people [they just hired guy to do sound design]. Rocket also has stated that huge sales success will have impact on roadmap [planned features and timetable] and that they are talking internally about changes.

So basically Bohemia is funding and running the project and Rocket is project leader.

That said, it is up to you (and him) to determine what you think that is. 

Can you elaborate on what he is doing and how you see it interfering with you/the relationship?  What is making you feel like you have been substituted?

My hubby's masturbation with porn was such that he was doing it daily and had a seriously decreased interest in sex. We went from 3-4 times a week down to 1 down to 1 every couple of weeks and then I had to really initiate to even get a rise out of him. 

I knew it was more than just stress of our lives. So I confronted him plus I caught him a couple of times too. He was aware at that point it was hurting me and us. But he was also scared of my thoughts on the whole subject until we actually talked about it in detail. 

We are back to normal levels of sex for us and we know each other masturbate but it isn't interfering in his craving of sex or interest in me romantically so we don't have an issue. He probably masturbates a couple of times a week at this point but not always with porn. When he is traveling he does it daily until a day or two before he heads home on longer trips. We had tried Skype for mutual masturbation and it was ok but not great enough to make that a habit.

Like it has been mentioned before, a lot of books are actually shared between Theravada and Mahayana, but Theravada just happened to ""close"" the canon earlier than Mahayana. Some texts overlapped in their production, so to say that all Mahayana texts are additions is an oversimplification.

If people come to my Thai Theravada temple looking for altars built to serve cool, rationalist logic they would be sorely disappointed.

Saying that, my understanding is mostly Mahayana and I can appreciate the Dhammapada as a book that is non-sectarian, even though it's usually attributed to Theravada."

Here is my advice for your mum. I hope it helps:

**For non medicated treatment** I suggest meditation and/or self hyphosis. I do it. At first it didn't work but the more I went on the better I got. The brainn doesn't actually feel pain so with some training she can block the pain. It will still be there but the training allows you to ignore it. It's kinda like you're raising your pain threshold to the point where the pain just can't get in. If you search this thread for the paragraph with ""Pain is the imagined mind-killer"" in it you will see what I mean.

**for medicated treatment** I suggest cannabis. if your mom doesn't smoke try using a vapourizer. there is no smoke or heat, just vapours. it's like breathing steam. It works in seconds and works for 30 minutes or so. If you live where weed is illegal i suggest you &gt;**just don't**&lt; do it. If you &gt;**get caught**&lt; you will be in trouble."

Your example of what individual religious people do is not relevant. If we assign 'sanctity' to one moral code and people deviate from that, then these people are violating it. What a majority of people do (in your example, you say that most religious people do not strictly adhere to their religion) does not influence morality if there is an absolute one.

We just kept him comfortable and he looked to be improving then had a second stroke and we lost him.


Your bird being unable to balance definitely sounds like this might have happened to him. The only thing you can really do once they get to this stage is to give them a little soft spot on the cage floor and keep a close eye on them. I'm sorry this happened to your little buddy at such a young age. :("

turnipsoup,linuxadmin,1389118176.0,"&gt; unset count is an awkward way of expressing count=0 .  

Both have the same end result.  

&gt;awk doesn't have any input, so that subshell produces no output, and your while loop has nothing to read.  

You're correct on the lack of input file in awk.  That's what I get for writing scripts in the tiny little reddit edit window without resizing.

&gt;An ssh user name with spaces can make you drop packets from an arbitrary source, e.g. user name ""- - 0.0.0.0/0 Failed password for invalid"".

I'd have tidied up the awk for pulling the username, but frankly I was just re-using ops code for simplicity.  

&gt;iptables-save | grep -q $ip has false positives. First, assuming you get a valid IP address (see previous point), it contains periods, which will match any character. You can fix that with fgrep. Second, it will still match IPs that are proper superstrings of the input, e.g. 1.2.3.4 won't be added because it thinks that 1.2.3.44 is a match. This is especially for convenient for an attacker who controls a /24.

That grep should be using both -F and searching for '-s $ip -j' and the problem is resolved.  

&gt;awk '{ if ($1&gt;10) print $2 }' is just awk '$1&gt;10 { print $2 }'.

Two ways of doing the same thing.


As for a one-liner - it's because I work in hosting and throw together scripts like that as single-use one-liners on the shell on a regular basis.  Needless to say, I'd put more effort into something I was doing on the commandline than something I hacked together in a couple of minutes for putting on reddit."

hermithome,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389118320.0,"It was her fifth woot-off. She'd been up all night, knowing that the next item was going to be a BOC and she couldn't miss the opportunity. Finally at 3am, her phone buzzed. New item....a BOC. Posted 32 seconds ago. Fingers trembling, she clicked the link. The buy button was still there. Holding her breath, she clicked. It was asking for her payment information...she'd gotten this far twice before. She hit the payment button and closed her eyes, not daring to look. Her head was pounding, her chest was tight, bursting....oh right, she was still holding her breath. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale and she carefully opened one eye...and almost fell off her chair. This was it, she'd finally gotten a BOC.  

OKay, sure, it would probably only be a crappy shirt. Likely that one that they pulled because the artist stole the design. They had tonnes of extra of that and it had been one of the most common BOC items for at least a year. But it didn't really matter whether she got a shirt that didn't fit or refurbished condoms...it was a BOC. She finally belonged.  

A few weeks later, after the excitement and hubbab had died down (after all, you can only dance around the house in celebration for so long), she got an e-mail. Trucks? Trucks? Could it be? She'd not only gotten a BOC, she'd gotten one of the fabled, multi-truck deliveries? The next few nights she slept fitfully, dreaming of broken furniture and all the random things in the world. Every few hours she'd wake up, hop onto the forums and read more stories from the few who had walked this pather before her.  

Finally, Thursday arrived. The truck would be here in only a few hours. She paced back and forth anxiously. Until she heard a faint rumble. She tore down the stairs and was waiting outside before the truck had turned the corner. She hopped up and down, as the driver slowly, slowly pulled into a parking spot accross the street. She could wait no longer...she tore across the street, heedless of the traffic. 

She got to the truck and yanked the door open. Inside was....inside was.....what kind of cruel trick was this? All she could see was an empty chasm...a space where all the random stuff from the Woot offices should be. There should be shirts and dysons and broken office furniture and ridiculously expensive corkscrews. Where was her beloved prize?  Her heart was pounding in her chest, she could hear a faint roar in her ears. She stepped back and knew nothing.  

A faint buzzing sound woke her. She sat up, blankets falling off her legs. The couch? Yes, she was on her living room couch. How did she get here, what had happened? Last thing she remembered the truck had arrived...and what was that buzzing sound? Fumbling around, she located her phone. New item: BOC, posted 10 minutes ago. No, wait. It couldn't. Had this all been some sort of crazy feverish dream? It couldn't be...this wasn't *Dallas*, this was real life.  Her heart rate slowed and she began to gather her senses. The date, check the date...and it was still the 26th. It had all been a dream. The visions of an Amazon truck full of goodies was starting to fade and disappointment was crashing down around her. Wait, wait just a moment. If it had all been a dream...there was still time. It could still happen. She grabbed her phone, took a deep breath and clicked the link....SOLD OUT.

noc007,AdviceAnimals,1389118352.0,"Set aside a couple of hours, get your W-2(s), and go to https://taxact.com. You will need to provide your SSN and this is required no matter where you go since it's going on the forms themselves. Read everything thoroughly and answer each question honestly which is imperative. TaxAct is cheaper than H&amp;R or TurboTax. Don't bother spending the extra money on TaxAct storing your info for ____ years; keep the PDF copies of your returns encrypted and in a safe place.

You can go to a retail H&amp;R or one of their competitors, but if your taxes aren't complicated, it'll cost more and they'll be just hitting the Next button for your. I've only encountered one person that was able to manipulate the numbers to get me a few bucks extra back and I wish I know what they did differently; it's possible he was covering for making a mistake as I didn't get to see his screen.

Obviously you can fill out the forms yourself. Just follow the directions and take your time. Go through the form at least three times to verify your work is correct. If you find a mistake, go through the work at least another two times just to make sure. Just understand that most online services don't charge for filing Federal taxes and are charging for filing State taxes; you just have to be really careful since they've designed the site to get you to pay for State filings and other unnecessary services. TaxAct is the same as others in this regard, but I don't have a problem paying the fee so my State filing is done as well and they did provide a service to me.

Regardless of what service you use, **get your money directly from the government and not an advance** as you won't be getting your full refund; the only time it's worth it is if you absolutely need the money sooner. Filing early will get you the return much much faster than if you were to file on April 15.

Another tip is on your W-4 is to have at least **one less exemption** than you are entitled. Every time I have put the correct number down has resulted in me owing instead of getting a return. There is the school of thought of not withholding as much, putting the money aside in an interest bearing account, and then paying when filing. First you'll need to get the math right to not incur an underpayment penalty. Let's be honest and truly evaluate whether you're actually going to do all of that and properly put the money to the side. Most savings accounts aren't yielding much anyways to make it worth it and frankly, you're risking an underpayment penalty. Give them a little more or a lot more, get use to not having that money each month, get a sizable return, and use the return money for savings and maybe something nice.

For storing usernames, passwords, and PINs, I recommend KeePass http://keepass.info/. You only need to remember one strong password. For financials such as taxes, be sure to use strong passwords as well."

Maybe a sibling or close friend to the bride?  Basically, this person will be in charge of talking to CrazyHag and making sure she's aware that everything she does is being watched.  You may even consider getting a video camera and setting it up to record?  If there's a videographer, hopefully they'll catch anything on camera CrazyHag does, but still, she might try to piss on the cake or something when no one is watching.

... right, yes, sides, my bad. But... not on the top and bottom. 128 no each side, yes?

&gt; In theory the squeeze compensates the stretch. Although I'm not sure.

No, in theory, when you make something flatter and wider, those two effects exacerbate one another, and it gets even *shittier*. Like, imagine if you scaled width up by doubling it and height down by cutting it in half... the aspect wouldn't be the same, it would be four times as wide. If you increase it in one dimension, you have to increase it in the other as well.

I have 5 mouths to feed, I'm going to try and make something everybody will like, without repeating meals to frequently.

What if my ideal society is a warrior state where the constant threat of battle ensures that people do not go soft, military leaders are respected, etc. etc.

There is no possible way of achieving this ideal without perpetual violence. Therefore, continued violence is neccessary for my ideal society to exist.

You would be hard pressed to find any notion or stance that does not have people on either side.

mrcleanup,offmychest,1389118710.0,"You are asking the right questions.

For a good relationship we have to know ourselves, we have to accept ourselves, and we have to share ourselves, and the same is true for our partner, they must know, accept, and share themself in return.

We often try so hard to act like we think we *should* that we fail to stop and figure out what we *are*. In your case, this all just sounds like frustration. The question to figure out is why? I don't believe that most people are naturally mean, generally it is a response to hide fear or insecurity.

So in your case, the first question I would ask is what you have been worried about lately? Sometimes we worry we will fall in love and lose control, or that we will lose love, so we try and sabotage it, so we can spare ourselves the loss later. Sometimes we have been hurt before. Sometimes we are afraid that what we want will bring disapproval from family, or our social groups. Sometimes we are afraid to admit that we don't want what society says we should, so we pretend and it gets stressful pretending for so long.

Sometimes there is a problem with brain chemistry... but that should be considered a special case, and not as your first guess.

If I had to guess, I would ask you what it is that you haven't wanted to face about your fears. What are you afraid to share with your partner, and even more afraid to admit to yourself? Or what are you ashamed of?"

TheLittleGoodWolf,sex,1389118813.0,"Masturbation (pornography aided or not) has long been considered the cause of many ailments all these have been disproved since long ago but the animosity against masturbation still persists.

Pornography has always been one of the first expressions of any new media, undoubtedly so even for the internet.

&gt;There was never as much porn overload when it was limited to magazine and VHS rentals.

The same was probably said in those times because porn was widely combated even then. The fact is that depictions of sexual acts have been around for centuries if not longer. Thus pornography is little more than a progression of that part of our culture into new media. But this is merely the history of it all.

The real nature that porn reveals is that both men and women can feel sexual attraction towards others than their mates. I also believe that today you will find a large number of women who themselves enjoy the release that porn can help bring about, do you object to that usage as well even if it is in a monogamous relationship?

Could it be so that the sexuality of men is wider and deeper than you think? Could it be so, that there is an element to their sexuality that you just can't fulfill, not because you are not physically able but because he simply does not want you to? Could it be so that he respects you to such an extent that his natural selfish sexual emotions can not be cared for by you because he sees you as a person unworthy of such treatment?

professor__doom,MechanicAdvice,1389118821.0,"&gt; When it comes to road surfaces with poor traction, Front wheel drive is safer when travelling at medium to high speed. Even with traction control my current Part Time RWD SUV gives me a sudden adrenaline shock when I accelerate just a bit too much and I begin to fish tail. 

All this means is that you want electronic traction control, which is available on a whole bunch of cars.  FWD means lousy tire life, steering that fights you (you don't feel it with power steering, but it's fighting all the same), and a pain to work on vs RWD.  With FWD, the weight shifts AWAY from the drive wheels when you step on the gas.  I call it ""wrong wheel drive.""

Sounds like full time automatic AWD (with the rear as the main drive) is what you want.  The on/off transfer case is really there for people who do ""serious"" off-road driving--not sure why you'd prefer to turn it on/off manually if you're not into that."

**Quarterback (A-)** I love having Hundley back there. He's a ridiculous playmaker. Only reason I'm not at a flat A is that he sometimes tries to force plays or take sacks when he could easily throw the ball away.

**Running back (C+)** Started out well with Jordan James tearing people up. Then the injuries started along the O-line and in the running back rotation. Looking for big improvements next year.

**Receivers (B)** Did a good job overall. Evans was a reliable go-to guy, Lucien finally got some scores, and Duarte is developing nicely as a red zone threat. I'm leaving out some guys, but this was a deep group. Also, one thing that went under-appreciated in every game is how much these guys are willing to go out there and block. Evans might be one of the best downfield-blocking receivers in the country.

**Offensive Line (D+)** If I was grading on a curve for their level of experience, this might be closer to a B. The group was ludicrously young this year, and furthermore suffered a string of injuries to our starting and backup tackles. Again, this group should improve tremendously in 2014.

**Defensive Line (A-)** Did a good job fitting the game plan for each game. Whether they needed to contain a mobile QB or disrupt the passing game, they always seemed to get it done. Shouldn't have a huge drop-off next year, as the seniors we lose have competent rising-sophomore backups, and Owa comes back from injury.

**Linebackers (A++)** Seriously, what a group. I would put this Linebacking corp up against any other in the nation. Barr was the playmaker, Jack was the precocious freak athlete, Zumwalt was the judge and jury, and Kendricks was the tackle machine and (IIRC) adjustment guy. Should expect a dropoff next year if only because the underclassmen meant to replace Barr and Zumwalt are mostly untested. We had a good class last year though, so who knows.

**Defensive Backs (C)** Not as bad as I feared going into this season. They did an adequate job rising to the challenge. They were exposed occasionally, especially early in the season, but they've come a long way. I'm looking for further improvement this coming year.

**Special Teams (B)** a competent job all around. Finding some good kick returners was great (Adams especially). Nothing stood out good or bad, except for that one failed fake punt. Expecting a general improvement for next year."

I don't recall the reason behind the change but I think it was something along those lines.  I do know that Wisconsin only quasi-complied with it though because you can still drink in bars and restaurants at **any age** (I believe...) so long as you are with a parent or guardian and they say it is OK.  The establishment can still deny you if they want to but it is legal statewide.  

Found this:  

&gt;The exceptionfor accompanied underage persons — one that Wisconsin has had for much of its history — was permitted because the stated purpose of the federal law was to reduce drunk driving. The
federal government believed that such an exemption would not undermine this purpose because the older person was expected to deter an underage person from *driving drunk*.

Stop using it, unless that's what you mean, and start using the word ""scaling"" instead, which is what happens when 16:9 video displays at a 16:9 resolution, but scaled up in size, IE 1920x1080 -&gt; 3840x2160."

That means there were limited amount of women even wresting at the time. The world class boxer on TUF got fucked up pretty hard, even though her striking was superior it just showed that wrestling, judo, or BJJ is going to win if they don't keep their distance/train extensively in those areas. There is no ""new breed"" of women coming in to the UFC. The ones that have been signed to 135 lb are all from this season of TUF and to be honest are pretty horrible even Meshia Tate would destroy them all. It is going to take a more complete package to beat Rousey and at the moment she is pretty much miles ahead of anyone else. Some people will say Cyborg but that is about the only one that has a chance and that is if she can get signed AND make the cut to 135."

I was in college, he lived in a suburb 30 minutes away from my apartment. He'd come pick me up on weekends and we'd stay at his place. Then he'd bring me back. Sometimes he'd spend the week nights with me in the city. I wasn't 21 yet - I couldn't really do much with my 21-year old friends.

We moved in together my senior year of college. I hated it within a week. He wouldn't let me have a life. It was my last year of college. I wanted to go out, be with friends, etc etc.

His sister said, after I broke up with him the following spring (about 9 months after living together) that I was only with him so that he would help with my rent and take me around the city to run errands and all this stuff. That pissed me off to no end. I wanted us to work - but he was insanely emotionally abusive and I knew I didn't want to keep that kind of toxicity in my life."

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1389119238.0,"Marxism isn't equal to communism, especially on the level we're talking about. It isn't an approach on a political system, it's an analysis of classes. It talks about a lower class and an upper class, and how having both inevitably causes turmoil. The philosophy is Marxism, Das Kapital lays out the problems with these in an economic structure and offers a solution, a communal society, where people make stuff because they want to make stuff, and give stuff because they don't need it. That is communism.

Objectivism is a merely response to Marx's opinion on classes. It tries to argue the other half, and support the notion of two classes, as the competitive world create an arms race, a race of industry. Artificially helping those at the bottom prevents them from adapting and pushing forward, thus crippling them in the end. This is best summed up with Ayn Rand's ""Altruism is unethical"" speech. Objectivism revels in class warfare whereas Marxism fears it. Objectivism holds the highest sin as taking away an individual's agency. They should live and let die.

JerfFoo,Destiny,1389119303.0,"I feel like everyone talking about this is having their own private conversation out loud, and no one is listening to each other.

Saying college players should be paid doesn't mean Destiny is saying he thinks everything they already get is worthless. And in fact, Destiny doesn't even think college athletes should be paid at all, at least in a perfect world. Unfortunately, few people here are capable of complex thought. As soon as Destiny got past starting the conversation(where he spent like 5 minutes awkwardly trying to word his two points on contracts), everyone went ""herpderp fapfapdapfapfap Here's my opinion that has very little to do with what you were actually saying.""

I totally agree, college athletes shouldn't be paid. Fuck that shit. I think it's as retarded as paying high school athletes. Nobody thinks college athletes should be paid. NOONE. I don't care what you've heard or what anyone has told you. I know you're going to tell me ""nope, everyone is saying exactly that"", but fuck you you're wrong and you're too dumb to know why.

What everyone is actually saying, is the economics of college football is changing and getting realllllly fucking big, and it's kind of weird only a select few people are benefitting. And you're telling me it's ok that players don't own the rights to their own image, and some singular entity does? What about if a player gets injured? They get screwed over instantly depending on the injury. It really feels like some kind of weird monopoly designed to squeeze every penny out of these kids.

Yeahyeahyeah, college football players get a ton of value out of they're career through college. A shit ton. I totally agree with you. But that's how it's been for decades, right? It's only been a recent phenomenon that some few people have started to get filthy rich off it. I guess we should just go good job coaches and staff on figurin out how to make millions. I totally sound like some liberal-communist, I know.

And can we stop saying coaches deserve their pay because they work hard? You sound like some autistic conservatives on Fox News. Every single player works just as hard as the coach, if not harder.  And sure, I believe they totally get compensated for it(minus them getting fucked royally if they get hurt.) But that's the line where lots of you can't handle complex thought or understand what people mean. There's been an established contract between players and colleges for decades, but recently the business has gotten really rich and only the top of the food chain has seen any of that disgusting profit in their pockets.

I simply don't understand the concept of keeping something you have to yourself.  Envy I get - if someone has something you want, that can suck.  But if you've got something, why not share it?  Yes, that applies to partners.  I based monogamy on what my partner wants to do, since I have no opinion on it whatsoever.  If they want monogamy, though, I do expect them to stick to it themselves, because I damn well will."

3840/2160 (or 16/9) is not equal to (3840 + 128)/(2160-128). As a matter of fact, even if you added 128 to the vertical somehow, you still wouldn't get an equal number. You'd have to add 128*9/16 = 72 to the vertical, or 36 to the top and the bottom.

""Why the Christ did you kick my junk and who the fuck are you?""
His small pipsqueak voice rang out ""Hey your the douche bag who didn't attend my funeral 8 years ago."" Then then slightly chubby boy delivered another small but painful kick right to my groin.

""God fucking damn it. How does breaking my boys help anything. And what the fuck are you talking about."" Reincarnation had been getting a lot of traction in recent years. Occasional cases of people being born with complete memories of other deceased people with information or unshared stories only those people knew were popping up. Was this kid one of those ones who remember their past life.

""Say you aren't a crazy little bastard, you are what 8 years old?""
The little cunt replied ""9 and a half you scumbag. You were a groomsmen at my wedding.""

""9 years, thats right around the time when Evan died. Wait, Evan is that you. About the funeral, I'm sorry I didn't make it but you know I had been traveling abroad that year."" 

""Yeah, well that doesn't change the fact that you slept with my wife 2 months after the funeral. You weren't abroad for that were you."" 

""Fuck, I'm sorry about that, but it was a mistake, and I am so crazy sorry about that."" Good god, he even knows about this stuff too, fuck.

""Sorry enough that you did it for 3 years."" And those chubby little legs delivered a third kick, this one was off and ended up right in my right knee. 

""Shit, ok I am sorry, we both know I'm a shit person, but do you know what you fucking stole her from me while we were in university and then you asked rick that pretentious prick to be your best man. You stole MY girl, and then didn't even have me as the best man, even though we were roommates for 4 years. Fuck, we have had problems but know maybe we can work on those, or not on account of the fact that your 8 years old.""

""9 and a half, and maybe you are right about the past. Speaking of which I originally came over here to tell you that your son, the three year old, he used to John Wayne.""

""What you know who others were in their past lives?"" This is goddamn incredible and not just for my boy.

""Yeah, you and all of you previous forms have been completely insignificant bound to toil in obscurity and amount to nothing, the same of which I expect you are destined for. And your son wasn't John Wayne the movie star, but John Wayne as in John Wayne Gacey the serial killer, have fun with that.""

TheFarnell,explainlikeimfive,1389119705.0,"There are three main reasons:

- Size
- Secrecy
- Political difficulty

**Size:**

As you mentioned, the military is *huge* and incredibly complex.  Billions of dollars easily represents just a few bucks per program, division, project, etc.

**Secrecy:**

A mass audit involves having a small group of individuals look at *every single expense*.  In a business like the military, this can obviously have certain ramifications when you consider the risk posed by having all that information available in a condensed place reviewed by an external body.  All the military's intelligence services, the advancement of new technology, etc... you don't want that falling in to the wrong hands.

**Political difficulty:**

It's not popular to criticise the military, and to the common person, an ""audit"" has connotations of untrustworthiness and suspicion.  A politician suggesting an audit of the military, therefore, is seen as being critical of the military, and in many places, that's political suicide."

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1389119737.0,"Matt Hasselbeck to start. My fondest memories are because of him. One of the few Seattle athletes to play with grit and heart that was good simultaneously. Gary Payton was my idol and no other player except for Griffey or Edgar in Seattle had that. So watching Young Hass do his thing, always on the cusp of being really good, every Sunday made me get super attached to the Seahawks. I always admired Ray Lewis and Urlacher so I developed a new found appreciation for the game once Lofa Tatupu emerged. It was cool to have a guy on my team that resembled what football is all about. LB is a position that screams old school. Watching him play got me into the sport even more. Subsequently, I was sad to see him go down and his career short lived, but then we drafted his replacement, David Hawthorne who was a mean run thumper. Pete needed a 3 down MLB though, so we cut him. I was about to cry thinking about Barrett Ruud manning the middle. Blegh. I was again super stoked about the Wagner pick who had ended up having the best season a Seahawk MLB has ever had.

TL;DR: Hasselbeck and the ILB position.

ChangloriousBastard,BitcoinMarkets,1389119996.0,"&gt; Finite supply. Inflation proof. Natural progression of knowledge. Global marketplace.

I don't understand how it can be considered inflation proof; inflation has to do with the purchasing power of a currency.  Even a contracted money supply can experience inflation if it's subject to any number of outside factors.  

I think that BTC is deflationary (to a fault), but that doesn't mean it isn't inflation proof, especially in the short term.  

&gt;Bitcoin surges when local currencies fail, because it's an accessible alternative.

It really isn't that accessible, at least compared to other investment vehicles. One of the biggest problems with BTC is that it's typically not that easy to turn cash into BTC.  Local cash traders are really the only way to quickly turn USD into BTC.  Currency markets *and* commodity markets are far more accessible than BTC markets right now.

And I have a hard time believing that at present there is a real and direct relationship between the value of a local currency and the value of BTC. In theory BTC could be an alternative, but it's not serving that function right now.  

&gt;The finite supply of Bitcoin means that it's never going to be worth less than its current value. IE 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC regardless of the conversion rate since it's not possible to just print more, like we do with fiat.

1 BTC will always be worth 1 BTC, but 1 USD will always be worth 1 USD.  Measuring a currency against itself is a redundant exercise.  The value of a currency should be measured using it's relative purchasing power.  

The purchasing power of 1 BTC when it was at its all-time high was not the same as 1 BTC where it is now. If I purchased BTC at its peak, I would have ~10% less relative value today.  

Fiat currency under a well governed central bank protects purchasing power much more than a currency that derives its value exclusively through demand forces.  Deflation can be just a destructive as inflation, and BTC has no controls to mitigate Deflation.  

Furthermore, a finite supply of BTC makes the currency extremely vulnerable to manipulation by whales. As it stands, less than 1,000 people own over half of the bitcoin in the market.  With trading and transaction volume as low as it is, even a small movement by one of those whales would have serious ramifications for the purchasing power of all bitcoin holders.

qwertyu63,gamedesign,1389120061.0,"Alright, idea for more dynamic Intellect creation go!

Power-amp IV and X could be combined, where the card maker sets the number (and a formula determines the price).

The same applies to Continuous Power XL and XX.

A reverse version of both of these effects could exist.

Power-down and Power-drain could be combined as well, with the card maker setting the amount the power is multiplied by (you have .5 and 0, but 2 should be fine as well).

Halve Break and Double Break Point could be combined and modified in the same way.

In terms of the cost formulas, here is what I mocked up (I tried to stick close to the prices you already assigned, X is the power number).

* Power Amp: Cost=(X/2 [round up])-1
* Continuous Power: Cost=(X/10 [round up])-1
* The reverse of these would cost 1 extra point.
* Power-down/drain: Cost=abs(1-X)*2
* Half/Double break: Cost=abs(1-X)*4 [this reduces the price of Halve Break to 2]

To keep at the idea, some of the effects that don't use numbers could still be combined. All the various negate cards could be put together with a drop-down menu to choose the target (where the target sets the cost). The marking effects could do the same. For that matter, having a card only target marked things could just be a modifier that can be applied to any card. Also, for the love of all that is gaming, add an effect for unmarking a card (with a drop down for targets).

Obviously not every effect could have options, but this would go a long way to making Intellects more interesting. That and let us name them."

Yeah, it isn't going to be perfectly applicable to you but it's close enough that you should be able to get a taste of what I am trying to say here.

You are trapped in a cage, and though your parents care for you, and your education is for your future, it is no less a cage for all that. And you are frustrated and unmotivated because you can only see what is inside the cage and there isn't any way you can see out of it.

But someday you will get out of it, and you will be able to go and do whatever you have the courage to try to do. And to a certain extent you have to take it on faith that you will get out. 18 will come and where will you go? Now is the time to be making those plans, to be getting prepared. If you speak a foreign language then college or living and working abroad become possibilities, if you don't... meh. If you know some wilderness survival you can camp and hike and see some amazing places, if you can't... meh. Your brain is still able to soak up new skills easily and it is going to get harder as you get older, it's time to be packing your brain with knowledge like a bag for a great adventure. Yeah there is the stuff they force you to learn, but what do *you want to know*? Put stuff you want in there too!

Anyway, the book is about a guy in high school who is trapped in his own cage, doesn't see it, things go bad, and he is given a second chance that also lets him see what is out there in the world, and it changes him. It's just a book, but maybe it can also be a little bit of hope for you that there is more to your life than you can see right now (about four-fifths of it are left to be lived).

Esotericgirl,relationships,1389120167.0,"I completely agree with this.

Regardless of how ""busy"" a person is, if they've agreed to be in a relationship they *make* time to make it work.

There's no reason that OP can't travel to her SO and just hang (even if he spends some of that time doing other things). It will save him traveling time and still give them points where they can touch base with each other.

And for him to say, as stated by OP, ""my desire is to finish my work, not to see you""... holy shit.

That is so entirely rude and dismissive. I could completely understand had he said ""Right now, I really need to focus on my work, but I want to make time to see you very soon! In &lt;insert time frame here&gt; I anticipate having a breather and would love to see you then!""

The dynamic as it stands right now sounds very unhealthy and as if he's either not ready for a relationship, or potentially (this opinion is based on other men in this thread who have acted this way) having something going with someone else and using ""school work"" as a cover.

If I were OP, I would call him and explain to him that the current dynamic isn't working and that if he truly wants to be in the relationship he has to make an effort. They need to see each other more frequently than this (and they need to discuss when those times will be, specifically), even if it's her driving to see him.

Or, they need to go their separate ways."

RecycledEternity,AskMen,1389120176.0,"It amuses me to some minor extent that you start out by saying and implying you only have one question to ask... where, in the end, I'm going to be replying to four different ones.

Why me first? Because I *know* me. It's not a variable in the equation that is ""sexual relations with a woman"".

For those women--since I have never dated any of them--I can only say that if I encounter such a woman, she would have to ""earn"" it, as in: if I don't feel comfortable with such a woman, or if she rubbed me the wrong way (figuratively), then I am less likely to offer up first as a compromise. The other way for me to feel comfortable ""going first"" (as it were) is if we were in that position, but she offers to go down on me first anyway. That means a lot to me--the fact that she would be willing to compromise, to budge first. I've faced too many stubborn people in my life to know and value compromise in ANYONE I meet. So, if she does this... I will happily insist that I go down on her first. I don't think she would object, quite honestly. And, if you're the type of person to ask me ""Well, what if she DOES object? What then?"" Then, I would say, I would follow the rule of three: If she insists three times after my insistence twice, then I let her. I'm a very flexible fellow in that regard.

Swallowing is important because of two reasons: one, because while I'm going down on a woman I'm going to be lapping up her juices the entire time, and two--*because* of reason number one--I'd take it as a personal insult to me if she spits. 

However, I realize that not all oral is intended for orgasm. Indeed, some times a woman just wants to suck without the intention of a final release. And additionally, most women cannot get off through penile stimulation--necessitating either manual or oral labor. These particular pieces of information complicate the matter. However, the solution is rather simple if we follow the rules of ""Foreplay, THEN Orgasm."" Oral can be given without anyone orgasming. And, stimulation between two couples can be done as long as either wants to continue, and then a choice of orgasm can be decided--whether it's oral, or vaginal, or anal, or whatever. It'd be up to the individual to figure out how they want to orgasm, and to the couple in question to agree on how."

I encourage you to look at what originally motivated you to start nofap or what could motivate you now. For me, it was to see girls without objectifying them. To be able to make friendships not thinking about sex and not making new female friends and then masturbating to them. Now I still don't because of that and because I want to honor my girlfriend.

There are tons of reasons to stick to nofap whether it's to liberate yourself from addiction, believing in human companionship, the physical benefits of not masturbating, the grossness of finishing then seeing what you're looking at, just to name a few.

Find what your motivation is. If it's because you can't live bound to being a 2x day fapper then think about why you can't live that way.

gobberpooper,Standup,1389120276.0,"I watched a lot of Russell Peters and Bill Cosby, but it was Dave Chappelle's Killing Them Softly that really got me into standup. He made me see how much of a craft standup is, whereas before I thought you just had to be funny and willing to talk to people. I watched Chris Rock, Louis CK, George Carlin, Jerry Seinfeld, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Brian Regan etc.

I gave standup a try in high school at a local open mic spot that's now closed, and absolutely tanked on the first time. I didn't prepare enough, the style was far too derivative, and the jokes just weren't funny (too high schoolish). I would've been discouraged from doing it again if it weren't for one thing: I have a very bad stuttering problem, but for some reason I never stutter when public speaking. I'm always self conscious about my stuttering, and I know people are only joking about it and don't actually judge me for stuttering, but it gets to me sometimes. When I'm up on that stage, everyone is listening to every word I have to say and I can speak crisp and clear.

So I went back, restudied and took notes on various comics (Chappelle, Rock, Burnham, and Ansari in particular) and watched interviews where they talked about their style. For example Chris Rock has never written a joke; he models his style off his father who was a pastor, and only keeps bullet points in mind and then gives a ""sermon."" I did two shows after that, once was for practice, and it went very well. The other was at my college to finally show it off to my friends, and the crowd absolutely loved it. It was 15 minute bits from 10 students, and based on the laughter and applause mine was the best. I've always enjoyed making people laugh, but now I can do it up on stage, where people come specifically to see me, **and I don't stutter**. That was phenomenal, and now I'm in talks with my college to do a show in the large theater and sell tickets."

so what do you do? first, remember everyone has seen what you are sporting, so stop worrying so much about it. unless you are in middle-school, no one is going to point at it and laugh, or say anything about it. no one will come on to you or think you are coming on to them just because you are sporting wood. second, be an adult. stop worrying about what everyone else is thinking about you, because most likely no one is even noticing. and anyone who is will probably be thinking ""hmm, he's got a boner. did i wash my pits? i think i did a pretty good job lifting today. do i need to stop at the store on the way home? i really hate my boss, he's such a prick.""

thepapacy,socialism,1389120321.0,"Agreed. Unless people are trained to behave democratically and in an egalitarian nature not only in the home but in the economic environment, the political system that forms to govern them will be Autocratic since it won't have an informed, active populace controlling it that is looking out for each others interests. Pro-social environments will encourage the development of pro-social people which will encourage the spread of pro-social sentiment to challenge anti-social relations between people.

This is why I agree with Richard Wolff about the importance of the left encouraging the growth of co-operative businesses as a building block to reinforce the development of a more egalitarian and co-operative consciousness. It's also why it's a shame that so many people on this forum are hostile and verbally abusive to people who don't ideologically think the way they do instead of looking at it as an opportunity for education and creating an environment to allow openness in discussion of thoughts and feelings they may have which are counter to someone elses. All that hostility and abuse does is reinforce that whatever they think ""socialism"" is is a threat to their psychological and emotional well-being so it must be fought out of self-preservation. Not to mention reinforce the idea that ""socialism"" inevitably will lead to totalitarian dictatorship since the way people who call themselves socialist handle differences of opinion is by abusive scorn in hoping the other person will be abused or shamed into submission."

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389120327.0,"I disagree.  At the end of the day, basketball players are entertainers.  Their ultimate value comes from their ability to put people in seats and get people to watch the games on TV.  Though their abilities and contributions to the team account for a big chunk of that value, their accessibility to the media plays a non-insignificant role too.  

If an NBA player refuses to sign autographs or interact with fans, he's failing to do his job.  Amazon warehouse workers don't bring value to Amazon by holding press conferences; NBA players do bring in value when they meet with the press.  

When NBA players sign contracts, they agree to attend public functions and make themselves available to the media.  They know full well what they're getting into, so I don't think it's unfair to hold them to it. "

  It all comes down too how much time you spend gaming. Obsessing over one game isn't necessarily the core problem most people face. The heart of the issue - the real problem - is spending a ridiculous amount of time on gaming to the point where you don't want to do anything else, or you don't care to anything else. So whether you are spending all your time on game or in a bunch is probably the issue. Therefore, I'd personally treat it the same."

So you can talk about Verizon where it's appropriate, but I hope that in the future it's discussed in language that doesn't exclusive by default non-Americans.

By the end of the 5 months, every single part of my body associated with getting myself around hurt. My good leg hurt in both the knee and ankle, and my elbows and shoulders hurt from using the crutches. I would argue that it is most likely from you not moving ""normally"" and putting stress on your good leg/foot that it is not used to. It could also be exacerbated if you don't wear quality footwear. 

I do NOT say these things as a doctor. I do not say these things as any type of trained body-person, or someone who once walked by a medical school. I am merely related anecdotal evidence from a similar time in my life, and you really should have a chat with your orthopedist about this."

Encryption is a general term, but there are two parts to it: one, making the data secure and two, verifying that the data is coming from whom you expect it to come from.

Going back to times of yore, if you sent a letter to someone, anyone handling that letter could view it. What's worse, anyone handling the letter could *change* it. 

So, how does one prevent the letter from being read? You encrypt it. But how does one verify that the letter you receive is actually from the person who sent it? Well, it turns out one of the ways is to have a third party verify it. 


So the process for an SSL cert:

* Generate a key -- this key is what you use to encrypt data
* Generate a CSR -- certificate signing request. You basically say ""Hey, ~~here is my key~~ , this is a sample of some encrypted data""
* Give CSR to a certificate authority. This way, the certificate authority knows what your encrypted data looks like without being able to decrypt it.
* Certificate Authority generates a signed certificate based upon this and hands it to you. It's based upon the certificate authorities encryption, which means people can't (in theory) falsely authenticate.
* You install the certificate on the webserver. 
* When a client connects and requests encryption, it's encrypted and sends another form of encryption based upon the cert. THe client can then verify with the certificate authority that all is well.

All this is done to help prevent what's known as a ""man in the middle"" attack.

dsklerm,AskWomen,1389120681.0,"""But here’s a helpful tip from the Free Advice Jar: whenever your options in life are “man up” or “wait to deliver bad news,” fucking man up. It’s good practice for not becoming a complete shitweasel.""  

It's from one of my favorite websites, a football blog that doubles as a relationship/sex advice columns. ""Man up"" non withstanding, the context definitely helps.  The originally question asker had done something shitty, like cheat on his girlfriend.  But it was such a revelation to read.  As someone who has a lot of trouble confronting their own problems, this broke through to me.  

I try to do good.  I am incapable of always doing the right thing. The important thing is that I TRY to do the right thing, all the time.  That means sometimes, when I do make mistakes and do the wrong thing, the only way I can even attempt to correct it is by immediately trying to so the right thing again, and get back on course.  

It's easy to be mad and hate someone, or be angry or disappointed in them when they mess up.  Its easy to lie and manipulate too. But it's easier to hate someone or be angry when they lie, hide from, generally act like a shit weasel.  Trying to remedy it may be uncomfortable, and I may have to admit I'm not as good as I thought I was... But at least I tried to correct it.   In the end it doesn't matter whether they hate me or not, as long as I'm comfortable with the fact I did everything I can to remedy the situation. I don't know why this advice helped, but effort matters, especially when you're trying to right wrongs. "

So why don't you? (love yourself)

&gt;It's like a deep sense of knowing. I am inherently just bad.

That's poison, that feeling. Someone else planted that seed, you need to stop watering it. That thought is strong, and it is easy to cling to to make you feel like you have some certainty, because it is scary being on your own. But that isn't a part of you, it was put there.

It's hard to admit that you have been treated unfairly, that you deserve better. Thinking about that hurts. It hurts being wronged, it's easier to think you deserve it. If you don't understand why, then you must just be inherently bad, right?

You aren't bad.

You need to find the part of you that you locked away because she has too much hurt. And you need to accept that she is you, and embrace her and cry for her. And then tell her that you love her and you are going to make her life better and stand up for her.

And it will be scary, and it will be painful, but each step you take gets you closer to the point where you can have joy again, and don't have to convince yourself that you are bad in order to escape the pain.

But if you don't do it, eventually you won't be able to lock away that pain anymore, and things will get much worse.

Step 1, give yourself permission to love yourself, even if you aren't perfect, and even if it hurts."

Cable companies could periodically put a bannar across the edge of a screen. Some shows already do it. News shows and sports shows use that area for information already, and you could easily put in an add once in a while. Normal shows regularly put little ads for other shows on their own network all the time.

Life-in-Death,AskReddit,1389120750.0,"Wow, poor thing.  And it does sound crazy, because it is crazy.  But we have ALL found ourselves in relationships doing crazy things that we know aren't who we are.  This is a pretty good indicator that it is a bad relationship for us.

The fact that you have hidden guns and have gone to hurting yourself means it has gone way too far.  One hair of escalation could easily mean the end for one or both of you, and it sounds like it has been escalating each time.

If you CAN see a counselor about this, go.  I am not in anyway an expert on this, but maybe you can head over to another board (TwoX?) and get feedback from those with experience.  All I know in all of my teaching of health is statistically: If you are a man and get murdered it is because of gangs/drugs, etc.  If you are a woman and get murdered it is your boyfriend/husband.  

If you are really feeling like you can't just ""abandon"" him then tell him he needs to go to counseling for a while before you can see him again (after you are already in your safe place).  Remember, he is also at risk to harm himself.

The whole thing with stereotypes is that they come from somewhere, it is not a bad thing.  These relationships usually have a set dynamic.  I had a friend who was so strong and like this force of nature.  She would eat men alive (this did not make her amazing, just a fact).  She just fell off the face of the Earth for a while.  She told me later she had gotten in an abusive relationship with a guy, she had no idea that could be her life.

I don't doubt that you need support and care during this time as you confront what you have done and how it has ruined a relationship already, but you need to get that support from professional mental health counselors and friends/family members rather than this woman who you betrayed so deeply. 

You know that she should find someone who truly will respect and love her, which you don't currently have the emotional fortitude to do. If you care at all about her well-being you will realize that there is just so much going on with you that it would be irresponsible for you to prevent her from finding a caring partner just because you want her back.

You also should not date *anyone* exclusively until you can take ownership of your culpability and wrongdoing here. Currently you are blaming many aspects of your life for your cheating but are not actually  taking personal responsibility for it. That is a way of deflecting blame which will just allow you to continue to do this going forward. Plenty of people have been intensely depressed and yet stayed faithful.

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1389120938.0,"Yup, what you said is accounted for in my massive post. In your case, you're being a little imprecise by rounding off to ""roughly 5"" (4.96 for Harden vs. 4.86 for Durant). You're right though, it *does* make a pretty big difference (more so than I stated in my previous post, anyways). If he got to the line at Durant's rate, he'd be shooting 8.9 instead of 9.1, which is almost negligible. 

I'm not sure that we can merely write off midrange shots though, because I've watched enough Kobe (and Wade, actually) to know that a decent amount of shooting fouls occur in midrange---a lot more than 3 pointers anyways (which is why I ignored those). And considering KD shoots more of these than Harden, his expected FTR should be a little higher. At this point we don't have the numbers to say how much higher, though.

I think I'd conclude Harden gets more calls than Durant, but *not* overwhelmingly so. Right now in the calculation Durant gets 97% of the free throws Harden does per shot at the basket (probably statistically insignificant) but that ignores the fact that Durant gets a lot of free throws on his rip through move in the midrange. Then there's the fact that Durant &amp; Harden likely get more fouls than the average superstar as well, so if Harden got the calls that Kobe or Miami-era LBJ got, then his numbers would look worse.

I might look into it and post thread on /r/nba this weekend, time permitting. By the way, where are you getting the numbers for the breakdown of where people shoot? I'd like to see that for various players."

We don't do /r/politics some chauvinism from time to time but we love them to.

&gt;I have noticed that people on this sub-reddit have somewhat given up the pride in their nationality (not fully, of course) for pride in the EU

Just speaking for myself, i have neither nationalism or continentalism feelings, I see the world, as postnationalist, nationalism is only a cultural manipulation used by rulers to convince the poor to die for their interests.

&gt;Much of its population believes that they should join the European Union, and not stay as an independent country.

A great part of the population believes they deserve a true democracy, a decent wage and human rights in line with the rest of the civilized world, the EU is a symbol, a banner for progress and reform, it is a standard of social justice and transnational equality, like the US was a symbol for freedom  and equality of chance.

&gt; and not stay as an independent country.

here you're just quoting anti-EU propaganda, for not good reason.

&gt;Is it due to power? A new colonial era?

The only imperialistic power remaining is the US, we rarely invade the national sovereignty of foreign countries(don't really have the money, military power or hunger for blood negesary). But I'll disregard that bigoted remark because you said its not malevolent in origin. 

There are economic advantages to have a free trade area that includes weaker economies(see nafta and US free trade deals) but unlike other capitalist superstates we have a bad habit of investing in the developement of those countries so they don't stay poor for very long, another consideration is strategic security, its easier to defend berlin if you stop the russins in warsaw. More opinions make a better democracy, more inefficient but better overall. There is also the strategic element, we have a big, really big and mean neighbour, think Canada, but with alcoholism, therefore to negotiate energy or security measures we need to negotiate as a continent not as a couple of states with different objectives that can be leveraged once against each other.

The last aspect is historical if you study late nineteen century diplomacy you will see that the only way Europeans could assure we don't fight one another was by alliances, so the EU is an evolution of that strategic thinking that by change also has some positive externalities."

TheLittleGoodWolf,sex,1389120979.0,"Porn sees to one side of a mans sexuality and sex in a relationship sees to another.

I will try to explain this from my own view so this will be personal.

First of all I enjoy porn, I enjoy it because it's diverse and fantastic (in the sense that it's unreal and a fantasy) and I can pretty much choose my fantasy. It has led me to discovering things about my sexuality I had no idea were even there. I discovered depths that I had no idea could exist in a man whose sexuality is mostly described as ""simple"" and ""plain"". I was in a relationship long ago where she found out about my habits online and she felt entirely threatened by this. This was at a time when I didn't know myself as well as I do now and I thought that all of my sexuality was dirty so I believed her.

What I discovered after some soul searching is that I had a truly selfish desire to ""get off"". I had a longing for something that was only of my own pleasure, something that was only for me. It was my desire and on one but me needed to be affected by it. Whenever I was with a girlfriend it became about us, I loved this person and my desire for her pleasure, our mutual pleasure was always the goal when we had sex. So why did I want to watch porn and masturbate after being thoroughly satisfied by the sex with my girlfriend? There was simply another part that had nothing to do with that, think of it as an itch that needed scratching. One that wouldn't go away unless you scratched it yourself.

Even if I loved my partner with all my heart and body I still needed to do things myself, on my own. We were still two different people and I wouldn't have it any other way, why would I, that different person was the one I fell in love with. We were a couple but that means two people working not as one person but as two people together.

Sex with yourself and while watching porn is so simple, it's quick and easy and with only yourself to think about. That is why it's so desirable and with that you learn things about your own sexuality, what turns you on what other kinks you have etc. It never ever diminished my love or attraction for my partner in any way. And if it did I wouldn't want it.

I can only imagine what you are going though, and i saw you mention your husband mentioning a kink to you and I guess you were repulsed by this. Just take a second and imagine how it would feel to have something that you love, something that can take you to the heights of ecstasy and then have the one you love be repulsed by it. Since I don't know the specifics I can't say any more, even if this is even applicable but you shouldn't judge someone on their sexual preferences."

The one that really gets me is the scene where casca and guys have sex, guts freaks out, shares his vulnerabilities, casca consoles him and then they make love. Best chapter IMO.

He's attacked every night, has to travel during the day, with little sleep, he's less than alone because casca is a huge burden to him. Physically, a child would be easier to keep safe and care for, emotionally she's a shell of the woman he loved AND a constant reminder of what Griffith did, to guts, the band and casca. When guts, the man who had the neutron star-matter balls to fight all the apostles at once with a broken horn, to fight Zod and not run away etc admits that things aren't working out, you know things couldn't get any worse.

At this point if you haven't built a lasting bond with your partner and found a deeper connection and enjoyment with being with her, things will probably not last much longer. As others mentioned, relationships, especially long-term ones, take work to maintain. All couples eventually go through slumps and hard times. If addressed properly and both partners make an effort at rekindling the passion, it can be kept up. In addition, having a more platonic bond in addition to the romantic passion helps fill in those gaps where things cool down. 

Relationships are living constructs made up of changing, growing people. Feed and care for the relationship, and it will be strong and resilient. Take it for granted, and eventually you will wind up deep in what you describe, and it will be hard to fix."
honestbleeps,chicago,1389121440.0,"it works exactly as described, and doing anything else is a gamble.

Note there are **two different** bans:

1) No parking anytime when snow is over 2""

2) No parking overnight between 3am-7am (I think those are the times) whether or not there is snow.

For #2 - just do not screw around. Even with no snow on the ground, you're gonna get towed. Don't do it.

For #1 - it depends. You can gamble and sometimes not get towed or ticketed when there's snow on the ground, and sometimes you can't. It depends on how parking enforcement happens to feel that day.  There have been complaints in the past that the street was already plowed so the 2"" parking ban shouldn't matter but people got ticketed anyway, etc. Also, their measurements of what defines ""2 inches"" have been debated as well.

Basically, if you can avoid parking in those areas, avoid it at all costs. It's just not worth the risk.

I will say that I parked on such a street recently and didn't get ticketed, but I only did so because a lot of time had passed with other cars still stuck in lots of snow and it seemed none were being ticketed.  I did eventually move my car. No telling if I'd have been ticketed if I waited longer to move."

Male colleague drinks two bottles of wine and crashes into tree skiing, paralyzed from the waist down. What would the Frenchman do?

Also, if you're thinking about park-hopping between the two parks, do it. There's loads to see in California Adventure just 'across the street', so to speak. The two times I've been to Disneyland we only had one day, and both times we ended up buying park-hopper upgrades and doing pretty much every ride we wanted to do in both parks, so it is possible (especially if you use Single Rider queues and Fast Passes economically!).

DrMuffinPHD,pathofexile,1389121749.0,"First of all, do you have enough life?

A common mistake new players make is putting all of their passive skill points into offensive nodes, and neglecting defensive nodes.  In reality, the game almost requires you to put a substantial amount of points into defensive nodes (primarily life, unless you're going ES or something), and requires you to have maxed resistances in everything by Chaos resist.

Around level 55 you should be shooting to have around 2k life (or equivalent) if you don't want to just die all over the place.  More life is always better.

I know maxing resists seems hard, but it's really not that bad once you get a few halfway decent pieces of resist gear.  A single good two-stone ring can give you something like +50 resist on two stats and +25 resist on another stat.  

Regarding not doing any dmg, the majority of the dmg for most characters will come from a handful of highly effective passive nodes and linking together a good skill with 3-5 support gems.

If you're still suffering, then I would really recommend either manually casting enfeeble (the curse) on your enemies or linking enfeeble to a lvl 15 or so CODT.  Enfeeble is a great curse if you need to reduce enemy dmg, and I highly recommend it.

Another good option is to find a way to build up endurance charge.  Endurance charges are amazing.  They massively reduce physical dmg and give you free resist while they're up.  To get endurance charges, either curse your enemies with warlord's mark or just use enduring cry.

Finally, because everyone knows that LMP Voidbearers suck to face, along with Tentacle Miscreations, you may want to have a ruby flask equipped when you go into docks or lunaris lvl 2.  Alternately, you can run Arctic Armor, but that will drain your mana almost instantly unless you build specifically for massive mana regen.

TL;DR:  Get more life and max your resists.  Carry a Ruby Flask if you still die almost instantly."

LiveBreatheOwn,bindingofisaac,1389121759.0,"Open the item wiki while you play. Just have it open the whole time and look up items as you pick them up. Remember you unlock items while you play and for many different reasons that can accumulate over multiple plays so don't feel frustrated if you die quick, you are still making some kind of progress.

Think of the floor you are on as a whole, not a collection of rooms, when you plan your strategy. For example if a Blue Heart drops after you clear a room, don't just immediately pick it up if you don't NEED it. It's best to save them for when you really need them or ideally, after you kill that boss of that floor so you can move on with a couple extra hearts. Think about it: If you pick it up early, odds are you will lose it. Instead, use your RED hearts (which are more easily replaced) then stack the blue ones at the end.

Another example are keys and bombs. Don't just use a bomb to get that single coin right away because in the next room, there could be a bomb blocking a Golden Chest! And damn you just wasted your bomb! If you don't need the resource right that moment, leave it and come back for it if you can. 

Enemies have behavior patterns that are pretty much predictable. Some enemies always fire in the same pattern or always move in a timed manner. Don't just write it all off as random, this game DOES take skill and you CAN learn it and get really good.

Good luck and feel free to ask more questions if you want.

Marketing is not something that just magically happens. People don't just discover good games automatically if they're ""good enough"". Marketing/letting people know about a game isn't a sign that it's a ""Bad game"" or ""not good enough to be viral on its own"".

* Realvision ENB with:
* Climates of Tamriel (+ optional additions)
* Enhanced Lights and Effects (RLO feels to dark for me and I seem to have less issue with ELFX)

Landscape:

* Skyrim HD 2K
* additional: Vivid Landscapes (I think there is an all in one - install AFTER SHD2K) Realvision gives which ones to use, but it's optional I think.
* Amidianborn caves
* Skyrim Flora Overhaul: Basic
* Grass on Steroids
* Skyrim HD Trees
* W.A.T.E.R. or Purewaters (I like aspects of both, but WATER edges the others out for me.)

Towns:

* Expanded Cities and Towns
* There is one that adds trees and textures to Whiterun... but I can't remember the name.  It's beautiful.  I wish there were more like it for other towns.  (Can someone clarify this for me?)

For props and devices:

* Improved Ruins and Clutter
* Static Mesh Improvement Modification (other mods have patches for this compatibility.)

For armor,clothing and weapons:

* Improved NPC Clothing
* aMidianBorn Book of Silence

For other stuff:

* Lanterns of Skyrim (All-in-One)
* Hunters Cabin (for a very basic first house)
* Enhanced Blood Textures

This is more-or-less what I use currently.

I remember after he stood me up for a vacation (on my birthday!) for the third time in a row.  I had finally had it.  I said ""So this is what hate feels like"" and then I said the only personal insult in three years: ""You don't know shit about science"" because I was so angry I decided to be petty, and I was convinced it was the end.  After I stupidly forgave him, again, he used this as an excuse to tear me apart with the most personal, hurtful insults you could imagine.

How would your boss handle things if you went to an event like this representing your company and a woman from another company publicly tweeted the sexually childish jokes you made? She *had* to know it wasn't going to go well for them. Sorry, I'm not buying it. She was uncomfortable with the comments they made. Was tweeting their info going to stop them at that very moment? No, of course not. They probably didn't even know she was tweeting anything about them. It was done simply to fuck them over. Clearly her job believed this as well and figured she showed poor judgment and fired her because of said judgment. 

Now I'm not a woman so my opinion is worthless here, but I'll give it anyway! If I were a woman, I *guess* my thought process would be, ""Ugh. Childish, immature comments. Thank God I'll never have to see these clowns again"" and might have left it at that. These guys have no power over her. She'll probably never see them again.

DaEvil1,forwardsfromgrandma,1389122175.0,"- I've never said that describing a child as ""a little shit"" is the same as saying it is worthless. Just that it was stereotyping.

- ""Panties all twisted into a bundle""? Implying I'm so little of a man, I might as well be female? Sure, we're already talking about physical punishment coupled with mental terror towards children, may as well sprinkle in some good old fashioned sexism into this.

- The only ""stereotyping"" I made was saying that I think they demonstrate by stereotyping misbehaving children as ""little shits"" to be **unqualified** to make a judgement in terms of what physical and pshycological abuse should be applied to children on a case to case basis.

- The thing you describe as ""rather an opinion"" by me is preceded by ""I think"" in my original post. So congratulations, you've successfully decoded part of my original post!

- the ""mental terror"" is the treath of a spanking constantly being held over the childs head whenever they are deemed to misbehave. The ""physical trauma"" was in regards to /u/Gangreless asserting that the original spanking have to be hard enough for them to remember."

""Alright boys, listen up, briefing time."" Unit 394 said as he attempted to stand in the cramped crew compartment of the Reaper gunship, his 3 squad mates looked up and waited for their orders. ""We're deploying to Borel for this op, standard smash and stab, there's a terrorist group based here who have been getting a bit bold recently and TSOC wants them shut down before they successfully do any real harm to the empire. As you know the Borelians are too disorganized to have a proper military, so they won't be handling this themselves, our first target is going to be a munitions storehouse, kill everyone inside, take an inventory of their equipment, and grab what encryption codes we can."" The other 3 lancer droids nodded that they understood and 394 sat back down next to the squad marksman.

""Well Merlin, you ready for all that wide open terrain down there?"" 394 asked his marksman. 

""Oh you know it Arc."" The marksman proudly replied.

""Good, ETA is 10 seconds, everyone get your weapons ready."" The lancers all pulled out their respective weapons: 3 M78 special operation assault rifles and a single M79 special operations battle rifle; the bay echoed with the muted whirring of the weapons unfurling from their 'portable' state. After a brief silence the back door of the gunship hissed as the seals equalized the pressure and the door fell down into the bleak grey soil, forming a staircase to the ground. The squad immediately rushed out of the gunship, each picking an area on the horizon to scan as they scrambled out, a short second later they all sounded off ""Clear!"" ""Clear!"" ""Clear!"" ""Clear!"" With that said and done they lowered their weapons, stood up, and set off to the south. 

394 'Arc' addressed the squad over their short range comms ""Alrighty boys, target is 20 miles south, we got a march ahead of us.""

A short while later, the squad has stopped while climbing across a small mountain to investigate movement in the valley below. Merlin is carefully watching through his battle rifle's scope.

""Looks like a caravan sir, nothing outstanding or unusual, just some traders going who knows where."" Merlin reports to Arc, who replies ""Do they see us?""

""No sir, not yet, but there is still some open ground between us and the target; there's a good chance they'll intersect our path, and they will notice us then. We could use our cloaking to slip past unnoticed or I could just drop them, there's only 7, this far out in the wastes, who would know?""

""Do it."" Arc orders without a moment’s hesitation.

Merlin puts away his battle rifle as the squad weapon specialist hands him a heavier railgun. He sets the bipod up on a rock and slides a power cell into its appropriate slot.

""We are all aware that the M90 only has a 5 round clip and there are 7 targets, right?"" the weapon specialist asks.

""Have you no faith Sev? I'll just have to reload quickly."" Merlin confidently answered as he sighted in his rifle and fired off the first shot, less than a second later he fired again, and again, putting out rounds as a fast as the rifle would allow him before his allotted 5 rounds had been expended. He unlocked the bolt with one hand, gave the rifle a good shake to dislodge the spent clip while reaching for a fresh one, inserting it, and locking the bolt again.

""Heh, they're trying to run."" Merlin puts off another 2 quick shots before picking up the railgun and folding the bipod back up. ""No survivors, no stories."" he said as he returned the rifle to Sev. 

""Let’s get moving."" Arc said as the squad set off again.

Another short while later they arrive at the foot of another mountain. ""Alright, the storehouse is in a cave system, typical guerrilla work here. I doubt we'll be able to see any guards until we're at the entrance, but keep your optics peeled all the same"" Arc informs the squad as they start their way up the mountain side, climbing a relatively short distance before coming to a small entrance covered with a cabinet.

""Weapons free."" Arc announced as he rounded the corner, sweeping the entrance and unceremoniously putting a round into the lone sentry. Shouting could already be heard deeper inside the cave as Sev pulled out his HMG and Arc led the team deeper into the cave. Sure enough, a group of about 6 or so Borelians armed with Aurian pulse rifles were right around the next corner. They hurriedly raised their weapons as Arc opened fire, sweeping across the group precisely and quickly, one shot for each, most of them were dead before any got off a shot, and the one shot they managed simply fizzled against Arc's shield.

""Alright men, we're going to spread out, they'll be on high alert and acting more defensively, take what surprise you can get."" Arc announced as they reached a crossroads. Merlin peeled off to the far left, Sev to the far right, the squad demolitions expert to the other left passageway, and Arc proceeded forwards as bursts of gunfire could already be heard down the other passageways.

Arc swept every nook and cranny of the corridor as he went, checking each corner, and finding nothing until he finally came to a doorway. He was too far away to see what was inside, so he activated his cloak and shimmered from visibility as he pressed closer. On a cursory inspection it looked like a communications room, wires ran everywhere and there were some expensive looking computers, as well as a number of worried looking Borelians with pulse rifles pointed at the door.

Confidently, Arc silently swept into the room, taking care to give no indication of his presence while he figured out which terrorist must be the leader of the group, or at least the best fighter; positioning himself behind them, and pointing his arm at their back, the plasma blade in his wrist sprang to life as his cloak disintegrated, the shimmering blue substance crackling and illuminating the whole room as it poured out of containment and formed a crude blade.

The body Arc had placed in the way of the plasma offered little resistance, as it flowed into its usual shape as if the man wasn't even there; needless to say he died instantly. With that business done, Arc quickly raised the rifle he was still holding in his other hand and fired two quick bursts, one at each of the remaining Borelians. They barely even moved, and they certainly never grasped what had just happened. Arc swung around to the other side of the console, congratulating himself on keeping it undamaged, and opened the local firewall before establishing a direct link and mining the storage for data, around this time the rest of the squad chimed in over comms, reporting objectives complete and what they'd found.

The demo specialist had found a small barracks, while Sev and Merlin had found ammo dumps containing a number of Aurian and Marrian weapons as well as a few Tecarian AT weapons, no doubt filtered down here through the black market. Arc congratulated the squad on a mission well done, ordered the others to sweep the storehouse one more time for hostiles, and opened a channel with the mobile HQ to ask for new orders.

I didn't mention the times when I confronted them and they beat the shit out of me because I was significantly weaker than they were. In those instances, the issues never resolved. Nor the times when I stood up for myself and the administration stepped in and *I was punished.* Standing up for myself wasn't always the best option nor was it always an option. I eventually did develop a thicker skin, a less kindly attitude, but suggesting that I somehow instigated it is patently false and, additionally, puts the burden of responsibility on the victim.

At the first school I attended, there was rampant bullying and teachers did *nothing.* They just stood and watched things happen. I was once dog-piled in the middle of winter and couldn't breathe. Nothing. I had people steal my things on repeated occasions and teachers did nothing to resolve the matter because I had no proof (once it was a gameboy and my name was written inside of it, but they didn't bother looking).

It would have been nice if the teachers had intervened. It would have been nice if there were stronger support systems in play that tageted bullies and tried to establish just why the bullying occurred. If it were simply a matter of my poor socialization, then simply exposing me to the bullying certainly wasn't the solution to the problem. Learning to seek out children with poor social skills and coach them in better skills would be a wiser course.

&gt;Just look at how many people endorse male-rape in prison (the real rape culture), and how many people excuse female teachers who rape students.

Seems like you're being misogynistic. First off, the prison population is no comparison to law abiding citizens in the corporate world. No sense even talking about prison rape. Secondly, I'm not sure if you've been looking at the news lately, but female teachers are routinely being sent to jail in the US for molesting/raping students. I'm not sure about other parts of the world. No one is excusing this behavior. Certainly it used to be this way, but our courts are no taking a gender neutral stance on this. Now if you ask the average guy, they'd probably **love** to have been raped by their female teacher, but again, jurors have been doing what they're supposed to do and have been giving women sentences just as harsh as the men."

My second wife and I have been married 8 years now and it is different than it was in the beginning, but it is also better in many ways, even though the newness has worn off. The relationship continues to get stronger.

There is hope. Share honestly from the beginning, if who you really are will end the relationship, do it fast and move on so you can find someone who genuinely appreciates who you really are, because that is the person you can really be happy with.

Tri-Polar,WTF,1389122786.0,"I can't say anything about masking because I know nothing about it, but lolita is not a costume.  It's a fashion.  

There's a lolita lifestyle too, but wearing the fashion doesn't mean you have to follow it, so I guess some could view it as a costume, which is kind of disappointing, because a lot of lolitas don't feel pretty in their ""normal"" clothes and having your fashion referred to as a costume can be hurtful.  We expect to be stared at and can ignore that, but some people take it too far.  Comments like ""Halloween is over/aren't you a little early for halloween"" are hurtful.  Also, you should definitely never take a photo of a lolita (or anyone else for that matter) without their permission.  It should go without saying but multiple times when I've gone out, people try to take pictures of me without asking.  It's creepy and it's rude; if you want to take a photo you should ask (nicely) and if they're okay with it you end up with a better picture anyway.  

If you're genuinely curious and ask nicely most will explain that it's a fashion, and they wear it simply because they like it better than ""normal"" clothes.  I look at it the same way I would goth fashion.  I personally don't like gothic style clothing, it is outlandish at times (as is lolita) and it's not my thing but I'd never call it a costume.  Wanting to only wear lolita sometimes is okay.  It's impractical at times, especially at work, and even those who follow the lifestyle can't wear it all of the time.  But to call it a costume is incorrect and can really have a negative impact on someone's self-esteem.  They're clothes, not costumes.



TL;DR- calling somebody's choice of clothing a costume is rude, please don't do that"

I have plans for a world I'm building that will involve like 12 different households, so I need mods like Overwatch and ErrorTrap and Woohooer just to make it all work.  Just thinking of not having those mods makes me want to cry (been working on this for nearly a year).  

I don't think anyone would begrudge you treating this exactly like a hobby or side project - but if you do get any work done on them, whenever you get time, I would love to hear about it  :)  The sims community thrives because of gamers who contribute mods and content.

Then I started playing with it a bit, upgrading the speakers, sub, changed out the receiver, used a lot of bass boost, tried to make something nice. When I got my car at 16 the fronts had no surrounds left and I decided to change them out. Took 8 hours to do! But I did it. Then I changed out the head unit. Then I added a home theater sub. Then another. And another. I had 3 different subs in the trunk and I thought it was awesome. Eventually I added a speaker amp and that good stuff. 

My car died a year ago and I got my bimmer. And then I put in my pioneer subs, amped the kick panel, and then amped the door speakers. It's an spl build, and it does its job well. Someone turned their head at car from a 1/4 mile away from my car. Felt good.

During the summers I go yard sale shopping weekly to buy speakers and receivers to resell on ebay, keeping the best stuff for myself of course. Been doing that for 3 years now. I currently have a 7.1 setup in my room from said speakers and it would have retailed for over 2k.
