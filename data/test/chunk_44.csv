If the conflicts in the Middle East have taught us anything, explosives are pretty easy to come by and easy to make from things around the house. It's not a matter of the police being outgunned; it's a matter that crime is evolving and law enforcement is trying to stay on top of it. I think they're overdoing it, but I understand the rationale behind it.

And yeah, I'm assuming that the DHS needs to spend a lot to justify it continuing to get its budget. Yay for bureaucracy. It's scummy and needs to stop, but I agree, it's hardly sinister."

The game is big and somewhat sprawling, and it has a lot of moving components, but it's engineered so sharply that you don't really notice a lot of that complexity churning away in the background.

mkvgtired,Economics,1389979490.0,"Unlike most countries that sell their debt externally, Japanese citizens hold most of their debt. A country owning most of its debt is not completely unheard of. For example US agencies hold the majority of treasuries, but in Japan the general populace is the largest creditor to the country, not a government agency. 

The Japanese culture promotes savings. In the past, the majority of Japan's retail banking was done at their post offices. Japan Post was the largest employer in the country. 

This ensured retail deposits were not very competitive and caused the Japanese population to look elsewhere. In come Japanese government bonds. They offered better rates of interest (even if not good) than a traditional bank account. Japanese people trust their government, so there has been strong demand for Japanese debt internally. 

This is a unique situation. It allows Japan to have a debt-to-gdp ratio of 238% and still have very inexpensive borrowing rates. This creates another problem. If Japan were to default, it would mostly financially hurt themselves instead of external creditors, making a default much more unappealing. 

Many countries are watching what Japan does. They have an aging population, very high outstanding debt, and dont have an immigration policy to help correct their demographics. *If* they can find a way to manage their situation, many countries will definitely be looking to take a play out of their playbook.

what_a_cat_astrophe,postprocessing,1389979494.0,"Everyone goes about their editing differently, but in photography school they taught us that Levels was there for the sake of adjusting your histogram to achieve a good exposure.  There are only 255 values between white and black (which isn't that many, and too much tampering can result in your image losing highlight/shadow data) in Levels, so generally we would just make sure the little [arrows were pulled to the edge](http://voorste.net/tutorials/Newspaper_to_print/photoshop_levels_dialog_adjusted.png) start of the little graph and call it good.

Curves, on the other hand, is more ideal for adjusting contrast because the curve will move accordingly.  As you may have noticed, your highlight values of the image are on the top right side of the curve, and your shadows are on the bottom left, which leaves your mid tones in the center.  Most people create basic contrast with Curves by making a simple [S Curve](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSdjXeJGg7CfmMfEG9fugc6wYJYpagT6AFP9mPh-S36gOx6Kb4Q6A), but there is all sorts of experimenting you can do with it :)  Including split-toning!"

kopiikat,howtonotgiveafuck,1389979588.0,"I also hate the phone. I panic slightly if I need to make a call, almost always ignore the phone when it rings, and will go without pizza if calling is the only ordering option. Skype is no better, and is almost worse. Sometimes, I'll get on cam, but then just type instead of talk. It's very difficult to explain this to people who don't have this issue, and I've had some potential dates get downright hostile about it.

Oddly enough, I'm much better with my work phone than my home phone. It causes me significantly less stress calling clients than it does calling my own doctor to make an appointment. Sometimes I can use this to my advantage and make personal phone calls while I'm at work, to ""trick"" my mind into thinking I'm making a work-related phone call. I'm not sure why this works, but I think it's because my ""work persona"" is engaged and I'm in an environment where I feel like a professional, not the teenager that used to make her mom call to schedule haircuts. Also, it's easier to hear on my work phone than my cell phone. Maybe that helps too.

Other than that, the only think I've found that sometimes works is completely blanking out my mind and just picking up the phone. The longer I wait, the more stress builds. Make your logical mind force your hand. Jump in the deep end. The first second of the call might be terrifying, but once the ice is broken, my phone anxiety usually goes away.

So let's pretend at one end of the street someone has internet. Then each house all the way down the street doesn't have internet. Instead, for instance, the if they guy at the end of the street wants something from the internet, he talks to his neighbors wifi and says, ""Hey, tell bill at the start of the street I want to look at this website"" Then his neighbor keeps passing the message down the chain of wifi routers until Bill gets the request to use his internet.


The idea is, a meshnet can use these wifi nodes to access the web, but they have to pay cloudcoins. Initially, only one person on the street has to pay for internet, while everyone else can borrow the internet and they more they use, the more the internet connected wifi node generates cloudcoins. 

The long term pipe dream of the devs is to get rid of the ISPs all together and have everyone hooked up on one giant meshnet. This is obviously a ridiculously ambitious goal and technically not even technologically possible if you want decent internet speeds."

bisousdarling,MakeupAddicts,1389979643.0,"I went from having skin that was so oily that nothing would ever stay on it to having only slightly oily skin, so it took me a long time to transition my skin care. I have my HG moisturizer and everything else I've tried sucks in comparison (it's Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel). I'm slowly starting to get my routine down and I'm liking it. I watched these videos from Into The Gloss about *how* to wash your face and *how* to moisturize. I'm not sure if they're a lot of bull, but I've been doing it for about a week or two now and my skin seriously started to clear up as soon as I started it. I still have some clogs and plugs, but everything else went away (so now it's time to start working on hyperpigmentation). I used to use my Clarisonic every single day and when I stopped, my skin freaked out. I tried to go back to using it every day, but then my skin would freak out more. I'm using it once or twice a week just to have some sort of physical exfoliation.

I will pull out all my contributions, and $10K in earnings from both my and my wife's Roth IRA. We will still have extra earnings left over in there, but it will give us a nice big down payment.

One of the biggest ""fringe"" benefits has been that when I have filed FAFSA for my wife's grad school the last few years, and it gave us a lot better financial aid because I never had to include the down payment savings in the EFC calculations.

* It's fairly obvious Jaime's voice is different from the voiceover

* There is a shot later on in the trailer of a Bolton man riding into a castle with a flag over his shoulder. Comparing that flag to the smaaaaalllllllll ones in that shot ""at Riverrun"" reveals that they are the same. You can see the same color/pattern easily.

* Realisticly, the Sons of the Harpy wouldn't send 50+ people to kill one guy in an alleyway. Let's be real. And yeah, I laughed at ""mercenaries""

You care about her, she's a great girl, but you're limited in how much you want to invest in someone who has hit a rough patch because you're not deeply in love with her. Which is fine, don't get me wrong - I just think it's something you might want to consider.

Also, how long has this been going on? I mean, you've only been together six months. How long has she been looking for work? It seems very reasonable to me for her to ask for help for a month or two while she's struggling, but unreasonable if she's asking for multiple months of you paying more in rent. 

Basically, decide how much you care about this girl and then decide how much you want to invest in her based off that. If you decide you're not willing to invest any more, then tell her that and let her decide where to go from there. "

mrpoopistan,AskReddit,1389979847.0,"In America -- judging by your spelling, you're not in America -- the usual best first bet is ""scumbags making money"". In truth, in America, we should change the national motto from ""E Pluribus Unum"" to ""Scumbags Making Money"".

Look at the scandal a few years back in eastern Pennsylvania where there was a judge deliberately sentencing kids to a corporate-run prison in order to get a kick back from the company.

The weird part is that there's a very strong back-and-forth flow in America between religion and scumbaggery. I can remember doing a website project with a pastor who was basically trying to create an MLM scam for real estate. And somehow Americans see this sort of thing as completely acceptable because God is just a laughable tagline that we attach to the real religion: screwing everybody over to make a buck based on the theory that life is a zero-sum game."

Somewhat off the point, but you're conflating the greek alphabet with nato phonetic.

""Alfa, Bravo, Charlie"" are used because alphabetical letters sound too similar. 

E.g. ""V"" sounds like ""B"", ""D"", etc. That sounded confusing over radio and other media with transmission static, and nato phonetic helps with that.

American news stations, since about the 70/80's have become more sensationalised. Surprisingly, post war American news was more refined - but boring. 

British news has been the same for a long while, Tabloid journalism exists within' print, which is what News stations in America replicate on TV (not all stations ofc). Whereas American print is a lot better than UK print media.

The reason they differ is mostly due to history, demographics, politics and society. It's crazy different when you compare them side by side.

For the exams, I had to decide whether to make them open book/note. I decided to allows a page of notes, but no books. Here's why:

If you allow a page of notes, students will spend some time going through the material and writing down stuff, which is basically studying. If you tell them they can use their book, some of them (the stupid/lazy ones) will think ""Ha ha. I don't have to study, because I can just look everything up.""

Furthermore, flipping through the textbook during the exam is probably counter-productive, and I hate to see people fail. Seriously, I had to dumb down the grading curve because so many students did poorly."

Working the controls is easier than in a manual car. There is a pedal gearbox (I know people keep calling it ""manual"", but that means ""by hand"", and only a few scooters do it that way). Tread down once to go into first gear, then up once for each upchange. Tread down to downshift. Usually there are five gears. There's no clumsy H-gate layout. The slight downside is that there is no synchromesh, but as the gearbox turns at about a quarter of the speed of a car gearbox, the problem that synchromesh is intended to fix barely exists on a bike. Just expect a bit of a bang when you put it in to first on a cold morning after leaving it unridden for weeks - it won't damage anything.

A car's controls are laid out to allow you to put a lot of muscle into them in the days before power assistance, which is why you have to work the brake and clutch with your foot. And even the throttle! Absolutely bizarre. In contrast bikes have had a logical and ergonomic layout size the 30's. There's a precise twist-grip throttle operated by the right hand. The right hand also controls the more important brake (the front). It's not servo assisted, and it doesn't need to be. Your left hand works the clutch, and a cluster of switches including the indicators. Right foot is the rear brake - fairly unimportant these days, and never get in the habit of using only the rear brake. Left foot is the gear pedal.

Steering - you probably don't know that all bikes have power steering at speed if you learn to use a method called ""countersteering"". No pumps or mechanisms to fail, it's just an intrinsic capability of the gyro formed by the front wheel."

However last Tuesday I dumped her because for months she had been growing distant, the relationship appeared like an after thought to her. She wouldn't want to talk about our issues, would flake on plans we made, reconcile and make other plans, and flake on those too. I has never thought she would be that girl. Then the day we broke up we talked a lot, so much was said, many hurtful things. Many things she was hurt about and I didn't know because she never talked about them till now. We're still talking, and we're having a big talk tonight to see if we'll get together again or not. That's a lot, but I put it there just to say people are infinitely different and you never know what might be buried. Peoplle repress shit and don't even realize it. Give things time. Don't wait till it feels real. Mine felt real a year ago. And now its not. There's more to be discovered before you commit. Divorce is something I'd never want to experience. Don't know if I could.

Major things you could add up to $1k even: add more storage space with a hard disk drive. Depending on whether you need to store *tons* of media data on your local desktop, if you have a network storage drive, you could skip it. You definitely want the SSD. A nice 2TB hard disk drive is under $100. You could also upgrade the graphics card to a GTX 760 for about $40 more. Both would be good for your needs. As far as I know, Premier supports both CUDA (nvidia only) and OpenCL (nvidia and AMD, but faster on AMD) GPU acceleration if you do anything that can make use of that. I don't know about avid media center. If not, the i5 still gives you plenty of horsepower and is a good price. Note the i5-4570 will run you more like $200 if you can't get to a microcenter. That's still a good price. "

Dudes probably look less rangy and women probably lose a bit of baby fat in their cheeks. But that's just about it. 30 isn't really even old enough to wrinkle or go gray for most people.

They're out there but they're not everybody. 

More often than that,though, I  deal with people who are in enough pain that it's preventing them from doing the activities that are going to aid in their recovery (deep breathing and coughing, ambulating) but are afraid of becoming addicted to pain meds, so they don't want them and need education regarding acute pain treatment and the facts about opiate addiction.

Something that libertarians/anarcho-capitalists don't consider is the idea that ""property"" itself implies violence.

TRK27,boardgames,1389980474.0,"Of these, Eminent Domain is the only one I haven't played. I have to admit I'm biased toward all of them, as space themes are my absolute favorite.

* **Race for the Galaxy** - This is unquestionably my favorite of the bunch. Just thinking about it makes me want to go a couple of rounds with the Keldon AI. It has tremendous replayability (I'm sitting on nearly 300 plays by now) and I enjoy every play... thinking on my feet and rapidly adjusting my strategy to the cards; the hand management aspect; the blind and simultaneous role selection; the feeling of a much heavier euro condensed into 20 minutes or less... I love it all.

* **Core Worlds** - The main disadvantage of this game is its length, and that, after playing for two hours and not making any really wrong decisions, you can get screwed out the Core World you could've bought by turn order. I'm eager to try the expansion as I believe it includes a variant that fixes this issue. Honestly the ratio of reward to time invested isn't high enough for me to return to this one very often. Another very small gripe - the art is excellent but the graphic design is really ugly... so are white card borders, too.

* **Among the Stars** - This is not a particularly deep game, but I'm partial to it because drafting/tile laying is one of my absolute favorite combinations of mechanics (Ginkgopolis does this too, but in a more complex way). It's lighter than 7 Wonders despite taking a bit longer, since A. the cards are randomly shuffled together instead of being organized into three eras and B. the special locations are chosen entirely at random and shuffled into this stack, so you have no way of knowing whether your strategy will be supported by the cards that are coming up. However, I love how most of the locations are very thematic in the way that they have to be placed to score, and I derive great satisfaction from looking over this sprawling space station that I've built at the end of the game.

Obi-Wan already knew what to expect so he wasn't scared and he took his time trying to understand Grievous fighting style

By the time Obi-Wan and Grievous fought in Episode 3 Grievous already lost before he turned on his lightsabers

Sure Grievous fought againts 6 jedi, killed 3 and damaged 2 but you have to take in mind that that time the jedis never heard of him, they were completely surrounded, the droids were fighting in a way they never saw before and Grievous was hiding in the dark so he always had an advantage, the second a Ki-Adi Mundi understood Grievous fighting style and he stopped his feelings from taking over the fight prolonged for hours even though a few minutes ago it was 6 vs 1 and now it was 1v1"

LawBobLoblaw,Fitness,1389980480.0,"Right now I do Smolov Squat routine which is only 3 or 4 days a week. That's it. I used to do two-a-days, six days a week, for two years while training for MMA competitions. Even worked my way up to three-a-days. Going from so many workouts to only 3 times a WEEK was hard for me, but let me give you the advice my coach gave to me:

""You can't get your lifts up AND do MMA. If you want to be great in one or the other, than you have to choose one or the other. Decide what's more important to you by choosing what your goals are: aesthetics, or athletics?""

When he said that, I chose MMA. But years later, I switched from MMA and onto getting my numbers up, because that's always been a goal. I decided to pursue it now rather than later, and I'm sticking to the program. I am not smarter, more experienced, or stronger than Smolov, so I'll trust his routine will work for me. Don't be arrogant or have ADD: stick to the program if it'll get you to your goals.

If you want bigger upper body like a bro-split would give then do a bro-split. Otherwise, figure out why you chose StrongLifts, figure out what your goals are, and figure out if SL will get you to your goals, even if it's one road that will connect to another road, later."

Ah, I see. It looks like you're not interested in any *real conversation*, you're interested in *twisting my words*. As for Shanghai, yeah, I do. The roof of D, the roof of C. The parking garage of A. The overhead ledges of C. LOTS of places to get vertical and PTFO. You can PTFO by capping the point and then holding it, you know, in case you didn't know that. I also spend quite a bit of time on the ground, where I mentioned I use SLAMs, and I capture the objective ***constantly***. See: capture points A, B, D, E. 

In Dawnbreaker, the bridge at C is a great vertical above tanks. PTFO, capture it *while* firing down on tanks. Same for the building at Point E, where you can fire from the second floor or the bridge. (Also works at Lancang Dam at Points D and E). 

Hainan Resort - capture the point at C while inside the building. Most people are on the second floor. If you're up there, you can fire down on LAVs that roll up on C. 

&gt; Also you can fire 3 laws in the time it takes to fire 2 smaws.

$400 a month on UBI won't cover it. That won't even cover rent.

Also, are safety nets are very piecemeal, and made even worse by onerous government restrictions.

&gt;People's healthcare IS taken care of. In cases where they need emergency care, they get it and it accounts for less than 2% of healthcare spending. In the cases of catastrophic care where they cannot pay, bankruptcy protects them from things like debtor's prison.

Just...ugh.

&gt;Our economy is also far and away more robust than Europe's and other ""first world"" countries. You conveniently leave out that fact. We're on top for exactly the same reason that there is a little less ""equality"". I'll gladly exchange the one for the other.

1) European countries are smaller

2) They were hit pretty hard in WWII, while the US was in the position to be the superpower of the world.

I don't care about maximizing economic growth, quite frankly. As long as we are growing, that's fine by me. I'd rather grow at 1% and have my needs taken care of than 2% and be in need.

In fairness, this is one of the core problems with democracy in general. There's no upside in going into an election telling people, ""Hey, shit's good.""

Truth is that Clinton has a core electorate that she already knows was effective enough to get Obama elected twice. She knows that all she has to do is go out there and lash all of the sadz that her electorate is hazzing and she becomes president.

I will also note that the Republican Party has done a terrible job of not realizing that core conflict in American politics has shifted from one of race to one of gender. Having pissed off every black and brown man in America, white males have no potential political allies with whom to align in order to resist a political party that's dominated by the agenda of single females. 

The GOP just limps along with voter surpression gimmicks hoping to delay the inevitable instead of attempting something more radical. The truth is, they need to nuke the anrgy racists once and for all, let them splinter off as a third party, suffer their time in the wilderness, and rebuild American politics on the lines of a male-vs-female conflict while inviting men from racial minorities into the discussion.

How they do that? I have no fucking clue. In truth, the slow death of the Republican Party is going drag on well into the 2020s."

But then I found myself taking on a very irritating, ""Don't blame me, I'm not even part of your system"" attitude. Taking the road of a political party that will never in anyone's lifetime hold any actual power is a copout, and ultimately does nothing to benefit anyone -- least of all myself. 

I can't wholly identify as a conservative because, while I hold some conservative personal values, I can't realistically hold other people to my own standards. I can't reasonably expect people to have my same level of ambition, personal accountability, work ethic, or discipline. Beyond that, I can't support political parties that are so mired in the wrong side of history that they're still adhering to a bullshit WASP agenda. Social conservatism is the main reason I almost never vote Republican.

On the other side of it, I can't call myself a liberal because I don't support dumping money into broken systems. Having been poor and homeless, I know exactly what it's like trying to reach out to the system for a hand up, only to be smacked down because of my age, race, and gender. So I can't in good conscience support our social infrastructure as it is. It's beyond broken, and in desperate need of reform. I voted for Obama because he was a left-leaning centrist like me, and I thought he might make a dent in some of those programs that needed reform. So far, the only thing he's really done of any consequence was close insurance loopholes. Which is something, I guess. I didn't expect him to fix welfare or student loans, but it would have been nice.

It doesn't have to destroy your sex life or dating life. Most people go months, years, their whole LIVES without knowing they had it. 

It sounds like you're a smart, pretty girl judging off the success you had when you were single. This isn't a handicap. You're going to be fine. I encourage you to do some research of herpes. Once you know a little more about it, you'll feel better. Society puts such a nasty hat on herpes. Its really not a huge deal, and its way more common than most people think. 

Good luck! "

You can tell in the tone of voice if it's genuine, or an excuse. Like if she's saying it out of appreciation, when it's genuine, but if she's saying it as an explanation or with some kind of guilty undertones in her voice than it's to tell you she's not interested in you like that."

Dating hot guys who worshipped my body helped immensely with my body confidence, though.

Also, I don't know if you are into fashion at all, but consider going out and buying a kick ass wardrobe. Every guy feels sexy in a pair of form fitting 7 jeans or a tailored slim fitting suit.

You look absolutely incredible. Keep up the hard work. And keep posting. It must have been hard for you to put your pics online, but keep doing it. It will do wonders for your confidence, and also give you motivation to keep up with your fitness goals.

Frankensteins_Sohn,AskMen,1389980827.0,"Take it the other way around. Had we prevented the neighbor (Serbia) to own a gun, Kosovo would not have needed protection. Civil war is the worst.

Once everybody is armed, you don't feel safer, you actually never quite feel safe. When you have a gun at disposal, you might be tempted to use it during an argument, even if it's in the heat of the moment. Why do you think after the arm race between the US and the USSR they felt like it was time to slowly decrease their arsenal? For decades, the world became terrified that either one side or the other decide to use these huge arsenal they pointlessly assembled. What applies to nations applies to people. I feel safe in Europe, because I know that none of the people I could enter in conflict with on a daily basis have the power to kill me with a pressure of a finger.

Sornos,todayilearned,1389980888.0,"China may not officially outlaw religion, but there was an event around 50 years ago that really changed the demographics of people who believed.

At the start of the Cultural Revolution, there was a campaign against ""The Four Olds"". The fanatical Red Guard destroyed, looted, and pillaged many many religious centers across the country. Not to mention physically attacking anyone they perceive to be a supporter of one of the ""Olds"". 

That's why China has such a high lack of faith today. A generation ago, you could have been killed for being openly religious. There's more to what happened in the 20th century than just official statements. "

0x_,SubredditDrama,1389981066.0,"You keep saying magical thinking, but that specifically means, well, i'll try: ""understanding"" something without actually understanding the logical processes/sequence of events in cause and effect which arrive at it.

Allowing the person to think they understand something, but being able to insert all kind of imaginary processes which arrive at the witnessed outcome, which could be all manner of crazy theories.

Its extremely common. Everyone does it to some degree probably, maybe with less logical things, such as emotions, they dont analyze their own thoughts enough to quiz how they come to emotional reactions and their validity/sanity.

Anyway. In the case of tulpas, you seem to be using it as a kind of ""this is like believing in magic, not reality"" but i actually believe its possible to take a completely logical approach to creating a tulpa from scratch. In fact the starting out with nothing, seems to make it necessary to build the thing from the ground up, it has no mind, no body, and you literally build its body slowly and then give it the most rudimentary mental abilities first, like the ability to observe you but nothing else, and build on top of that, like work on teaching it parrot-fashion mimicry... get your mind used to that.

So it progresses over time, i have no idea, but i imagine you dont just ""poof"" its ready in an hours work. Its not just imagining it doing something, vividly enough to be visible in color, but to be able to do simple things by itself, without you forcing it to. And thats a self-deception that takes time to learn.

I believe perhaps, you go through a purely logical process, which is the opposite of magical thinking, and slowly as each phase progresses, you surrender an awareness of the forcing aspect as the tulpa takes over, and you can let your mind simulate it without effort so it feels like its all coming from the tulpa, and you can now forget about forcing it, and almost pretend its no longer *you*. Its only at that point it becomes an element of the tulpa you have handed over to ""elective magical thinking"", and now, you have learned magical thinking. As opposed to falling victim to logical fallacy and laziness, quite the opposite, you are progressing to magical thinking by way of hard work and effort in advanced self-deception.

I dont believe in tulpas i have to say, i believe the mind can be trained to do this. I just wanted to raise it up, rather than tear it down. 

Magical thinking is laziness. Tulpa forcing is hard work and takes a long time.

I imagine. I did spend a week lurking their threads and reading the detail of their practise. So i am more inclined to try and understand it, than dismiss it as *only* magical thinking."

He lived such a full live and it was a life that I am immensely proud to have been a part of. 

I know I won't ever see my Dad again. I try to honor his memory by living up to his expectations. I try to live a life that would make him proud. If I can live half the life he did, I will have had a good life and will have made good on this world. I want to be like the man my father was at the end of his life, and that's no small order.

I keep my Dad ""alive"" by remembering the things he taught me, the funny and endearing mannerisms he had, and I want to pass those on to my eventual children. Life has to end at some point for everybody, but the impact we create is something that can live on forever.

It's a hard time to be sure, but we grieve when we've lost something good. I take comfort in knowing that my grief is so strong because it reflects the wonderful 24 years that I had with Dad. I don't know if any of this helps, but maybe reminding him that his Grandpa loved him and that he now has a duty to live his life in a way that makes his Grandpa proud would help.

It also has a bolt from a Mk.III, and someone's upgraded the grip screws to stainless hex-head.

I go inside, no one knows what the hell I'm in there for, so I return outside after doing a circle around the bar (~5min).

The format is 8 rounds: 6 rounds of 6 questions each, 1 point per right answer, with 2 theme rounds, 4 rando rounds.  One of the rounds is a ""wipout"" round which means a wrong answer gets you zero for the round. (blanks don't count against you). Round 4 is a picture round, and Round 7 is a music round. 

Each team has a chance to ""joker"" one (and one only) of the question rounds - making it worth double points.

mrpoopistan,asktrp,1389981425.0,"&gt; wondering if a guy is allowed to have friends who are girls

Count me in the group that disagrees with the prevailing TRP wisdom on this subject. Men and women can be friends, but . . .

1) You need to be honest about why you're there. If you're trying to do friends in lieu of a real relationship, then you need to cut it out.

2) You can't let her play and tease at you.

3) You can't allow her to act in a GF-like manner toward you at all, because some potential female mates will get a sniff of that and avoid you.

I will say that a decently attractive female friend can be a very useful social prop in a game context. Being the cool guy with attractive friends of both genders works very well in full-on social circle game. I have a female friends with kids (who I never intend to date for that reason) who I use this way. She's cute, she's very cool, and she's very easy to hang around with. It goes a long way toward drawing other women into the conversation as long as I keep boundaries with her."

rudolfs001,AskMen,1389981505.0,"Damnit, I'm late. Here's a great one my friend told me:

Okay ... About 5 years ago I was dating this girl who I was pretty much sure I was going to marry. Her college was up in Harrisburg, PA so I hopped on a train and surprised her with a visit for her birthday. She was thrilled and we had two weeks together until I had to go back home.

The first night, she was all hot and bothered so I had to attend to her need. Now ... Sex has always been so god damn boring for me. Basically, I've got the stamina of an ox so I'll go strong for hours, but the act of sex never lived up to all the hype. This time, however, she wanted to do the butt sex. I happily obliged, it was new to the both of us so why the hell not. Maybe I would finally be able to finish this time.

Immedietly, as we start, I go right in and feel the sharpest, warm pain I've ever felt in my entire life. I just thought she was tight or something, which excited me since she her ""man in the boat"" was all loosey goosey. About 10-15 minutes in, I can't take this pain anymore so I pull out ... To my shock and horror there were two things wrong with what I just saw: 1. My dick was COVERED in her shit, and I mean fucking COATED like a god damn candy bar; and 2. Seaping out of the sides of this shit-cicle was blood, a quiet a bit of it. ... I now realized why I was in so much pain; my dick had been sliced from the base of the tip to the bottom of the shaft.

I'm in such shock and pain, I can't even react to what is going on. My GF is panting like a dog in heat, sweating with her ass still in the air. So guess who has to drive himself to the hospital ... THIS GUY!

I get to the hospital, go to the ER, and basically drop my pants and demand help right fucking now. After getting cleaned off and examined, the doctor gives me the good news: the cut on my penis is gangrenous and they may need to amputate before it spreads and kills me.

I DEMAND another solution, and that is to be doped up HEAVILY on meds and pray to every religions God that this gets better. I spent almost half of my stay in the hospital drugged out of my skull. And I swear, my dick turned GREEN like the Incredible Hulk at one point. After I leave the hospital in perfect health, I spend the rest of my stay relaxing as much as possible with my GF. On the final day she turns to me and says ""Hey, it's my birthday ... We have to have sex.""

Now, the doctor said ""Hey, you should probably know this already, but just incase DON'T FUCKING HAVE SEX FOR A LONG WHILE!""

She eventually persuades me into having normal, vaginal sex and, thinking it would be easy since I could basically spelunk her gapping pussy, I agree to do the sexy time.

Here is where I felt the SECOND sharpest pain I've ever felt in my entire life. It was as if I was wearing a condom made of sandpaper and tiny shards of glass. I can't even take it, so I pull back out and guess what ... BLOOD! ... Great, I think, I reopened my fucking cock wound! ... Wait a minute ... This isn't ... My blood ... Oh God ... Yes, that's right, my GF was on her period ... And along with her period blood being smeared all over my dick and pubes, there were also bits of skin ...

I ran faster than I've ever ran before to the dorm showers, naked. And, great timing, there must have been some kind of fucking ""Let's All Hang Out In The Hall Way!"" party going on, because I ran past TONS of people. I get into the showers, ferverously wipe away her gift of period blood and bits of skin, and then slumped down in the shower in pain. About 20 minutes or so later, I walk back to the room ... And her tranny friend who WAS a girl, but was now halfway to being a guy, is banging her. I grab my things, catch the next train home, and vowed to never return to that unholy land of Harrisburg.

Me: ""Did you ever find out the cause of her ass-razors?""

Oh, I forgot that part I guess. I hit her tailbone at JUST the right (or wrong) angle.
Also, when she asked me if I wanted to have butt sex, she said ""Would you do me the honor of popping my butt virginity?"""

869689698,polandball,1389981543.0,"&gt; No; the problem isn't talking about prevalent attitudes. The ironic part is that you are judging an entire community by the bad apples in it. This kind of stereotyping and prejudice is just one of the many horrible and terrible things the Nazis did.

Again, vaguely coincidental, not ironic.  But yeah, okay so never ever generalize ""negatively"" lest you become a Nazi.  Got it.

&gt; But it would be expected that Jewish people would be exceptionally sensitive to prejudice and negative generalizations
&gt; 

Slightly hypocritical no?  You just generalized the entire Jewish people and how they should and shouldn't behave.  Because the holocaust happened, I should be a saint?  My actions get judged by a double standard?  A white Christian male wouldn't know any better, therefor no biggie?  

I invite you to go to /r/worldpolitics /r/worldnews /r/conspiracy /r/AmericanJewishPower /r/Palestine /r/arabs .  Step outside Polandball to see where the real prejudice and stereotyping is going on.  Realize a lot of the people who post in those places are interested in geopolitics and thus post here too.  That's all I was saying.

&gt; Speaking of presumptions about people, I had two relatives who were killed in German concentration camps, plus another who was killed fighting them in France. No, they weren't Jews; there were plenty of other people who were systematically murdered because of their ethnicity. So I have genuine reasons to be somewhat sensitive about this subject, too. **Get over yourself**; you're not the only person who's part of a religion or ethnicity that has been persecuted.

Ah yes SPEAKING of presumptions, yet again you're doing that generalizing and stereotyping thing you just so fervently warned me against.  Where did I ever in this thread attempt to mitigate the suffering of other people during the holocaust?  I never once belittled them but now you're putting words in my mouth and chastising me for something I didn't do.  I'm just a self-centered Jew who fails to recognize others suffering right?

Yep.  The idea that there might be two kids playing in the dark, hidden under leaves, in the road is not a conclusion I would jump right to.  I would be thinking, ""But I didn't see any kids outside when I went past,"" so I don't think she would have had a real reason to believe it was her."

fridge_logic,news,1389981567.0,"It's widely agreed that felony drug laws overstep the bounds of what is required to protect society. But the felony charge isn't about the accident it's about concealing the act.

An employer has a right to know about this kind criminal act. Think about the kind of liability a company could be exposed to if the employee later behaved similarly in trying to conceal illegal acts performed by members of the company. This is especially relevant for accidental illegal acts like not properly filing taxes or failing to report information to the government or violating workers rights in any number of ways. Concealment implies malice in addition to being malicious itself. The act of concealment is key to many conspiracy charges and a charge of conspiracy by the company management or a culture of concealment is how an illegal act can go from destroying one person's life to destroying an entire branch or company and hurting all the people in it.

What got me was there were lawn chairs everywhere and fake posters of happy people on cruises and luau decorations that were obviously bought form the dollar store down the street. Why they settled on those decorations I haven't a freaking clue. 

Turned out, I wouldn't be working form home, but I would go door to door selling vacuums. My parents didn't raise an idiot and I went through the interview to be polite.

As soon as I got home they called me offering me the job. I told them, more or less, to ""piss off.""

I did research on the ""company"" come to find out there were a ton of lawsuits against them and all these horrid stories from former employees. The one story I found that stuck in my mind was a man who got laid off, desperate for work signed on, and after two weeks was getting no more than 3 hours of sleep a night and was eventually arrested for breaking and entering after forcing himself into a persons home to sell them a vacuum.

"
1kachan,Libertarian,1389981703.0,"Note that as I said earlier I try to look at Health Care pragmatically because Universal Health Care is here to stay and anyone who thinks otherwise needs to check themselves. 

The [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_canada) page is actually pretty informative. 

&gt; If you lived in the US, would you be in favor of the US switching to a single-payer system? What about switching to a system that matches Canada's? 

If I lived in the United States, assuming things remain the same, I would of course be more inclined to prefer the US switch to a two-tier single payer system rather than continue with Obamacare, however it would result in the insurance industry having a lot smaller role than they currently have, and I don't know if a lot of Americans would be okay with that. The private sector might not like the shrink in the services they provide, whereas here in Canada our insurance industry is accustomed the the smaller pool of services they can provide because it has become the norm. 

Canadians have a differing opinions on the role of government, and providing health care has been deemed of top priority by the electorate, none of our political parties or even business (at least mainstream ones) argue against it. 

&gt; In what ways do you feel like UHC in Canada succeeds and fails? 

The most obvious would be that there is no necessity for an individual to have a health insurance plan. The question of whether or not they could afford health care wouldn't matter because our taxes pay for it. 

Also as I said earlier, Canada has a two-tier system which means health care is not fully universal in Canada, there are aspects of it that are currently privatized depending on the province you reside, so there is a role for the private sector. A lot of employers cover the health care that falls under the private sector, much like how it is in the United States. 

Also it is worth noting that most of the services which are universal are still provided by private entities, it is just our government health plan that pays for it.

As far as some fails, 

Since Health Care is a provincial responsibility here in Canada as it has been defined in our constitution, different provinces have different coverage. As well since it is a provincial responsibility, different provinces are therefore unable to support the system like others because of their economy, so the federal government through the maintenance of a standard of care provides equalization payments to the provinces which need it to maintain the standard across Canada. 

I can see how certain residents of have-provinces (such as Alberta) would be upset with having to pay equalization payments to other provinces (such as Quebec) through the federal government to maintain standards of care, however most Canadians think standardization is important. 

Wait times can be crazy at hospitals and clinics, and there is a demand for private practice family doctors. Wait times to see specialists can be especially bad. This is where I feel the private sector could step in and have specialists who are more readily available for those who can pay for it. It would cut wait times. Lefties argue that if we allow a larger role for the private sector, it means a drop in care for the public sector because there would be more incentive to work private practice. 

 Luckily I have a family doctor, however for those that don't we currently have a shortage of family doctors and therefore most Canadians have to wait in lines for services at the hospital (with that being said, emergencies are considered top priority and skip the line) but if I were to need to see a specialist, I'd have to wait quite some time. 

Some Canadians who can pay for it go south of the border to receive health care faster and I feel those dollars spent on HC in the US could be retained in Canada if we had a larger private sector role. The % of Canadians who do this is very small though, so I don't think there is much of an argument to do this on the national level currently. 

UHC in Canada is complex.

Strictly speaking, this doesn't mean they don't believe in hell. Despite some modern protestant denominations trying to express the new dogma of faith alone salvation, the traditional christian belief is that hell was for morally corrupt people, not a strict line for believers and unbelievers. If they're your friends they probably don't think you're a terrible person. So they're hoping you end up saved anyways.

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:31-46

This part explains it. There's more, but I'm too lazy to go into it.

&gt;The more interesting question is what happens to christianity without hell? The very existence of hell as a concept serves as the stick, and inversely if there is no hell then everyone gets the carrot. It might be nice to think that people are into religion because it's the right thing to do, but I think it'd be naive to insist that the carrot/stick aren't relevant in their conversion/maintaining their faith. Can christianity sustain itself without it?

Also, look into the idea of purgatory. Look at the buddhist hells. They believe that people's stay there is not forever... but their stay there is sometimes great lengths... sometimes even millions or BILLIONS of years. If someone thinks that something bad they do now is going to net them eons of payment back for it it serves as a determent even if that repayent ends. And most people I know who think people don't stay forever still think eople go there.

If someone believed in INSTANT universal reconciliation, then that might be different. "

ZapActions-dower,AskReddit,1389981787.0,"Up until the 20th century, the second most spoken language in the US was German.  The US has had huge German and French populations since it's inception.

Not to mention, the regions of the US were settled by very different people with very different goals in mind.  The Northeast was originally settled by the Puritans looking for a place to set up their own religious society away from the Church of England.  The middle of the East Coast was founded by English entrepreneurs and values tradition and money.  The South was basically put together on the model of the West Indies slave society, with rich Englishmen setting themselves up as lords of this new country.

Then you have the everpresent Spanish/Mexican influence in the south spreading from southern Texas to southern California, the incredibly French regions like New Orleans (the rest of Louisiana is more Deep South than anything else, and a shithole,) and the regions of the interior, settled by varied peoples.  Appalachia is very individualistic, settled originally by people who were too cramped in the sparsely populated colonies and spread out to the mountain wilderness.

And that doesn't take into account all of the Chinese immigrants who came to the West Coast during the 19th century, or the Japanese and Koreans.  Most signs in major cities are in two languages.  In most of the country, the second language is Spanish.  In Hawaii, the Japanese population is so large that signs are also written in Japanese.  And I've hardly said anything about the native populations."

sleepyj910,Parenting,1389981827.0,"It's normal for children at the start of puberty to be curious and attempt to access this information, and maybe even see it.  Certainly by age 12 most boys will be raging on hormones, so it's expected of them to seek this stuff out.  So long as these kids are in control of the input, and it's not super easy to access, they will probably regulate it in a typical manner (as opposed to like an abuser forcing it on them)

It's not normal for parents to ignore it, or not talk about sex early enough so that children understand that pornography is not a reflection of real relationships or behavior.

So my perception is that one shouldn't punish children for seeking out sex, but should use that event as a discussion starter.  I think that's mainly what people are saying...not that we should watch hardcore porn with our children, or not provide a basic amount of protection.

Obviously porn is much more accessible and graphic than it used to be.  Magazines are just pictures, and leave a lot up to the imagination. Dial up modems were not efficient in downloading videos.

If we can't protect our children, then we must be willing to talk to them."

I have never wanted kids, and was the best decision I have ever made. However, now that I am older and have had various period related issues, I wish they would've just taken everything out since I am not using them. 

Most of the time, they won't even consider tying your tubes, let alone removing them, unless you are over 35, have already had children, or have a medical complication. All of which also tend to make you get psychological exams to make sure you won't change your mind later in life and regret it.

If you're doing chivalrous things by default -- holding open doors, paying for dinner, taking the lead, defending her against attacks -- you're just being a guy. That's how a typical, well-adjusted man rolls because that's just a part of his personality. He doesn't overanalyze these actions or make a big deal out of them, nor does he draw attention to them any more than he draws attention to breathing or blinking. Women dig this because there's no expectation that comes with it. He's just being genuinely nice.

White knights, on the other hand, do all this with the expectation that they'll be rewarded with sex. This idea usually comes from being raised by women or bad television: it gives an incomplete picture of these behaviors, and presents sex as a reward when such a reward shouldn't be expected. The result is when they find out that they're not going to be rewarded with sex, white knights will get very bitter and whiny about all their effort being wasted on ungrateful bitches (I'm sure everyone here has met someone like this at one point or another). That in turn is a complete turnoff, which just makes their chances of getting laid even slimmer.

So no, white knighting isn't an effective strategy in the slightest. It's a prime example of misinformation employed in a disastrous fashion."

Dysalot,AskReddit,1389982119.0,"I've been to Winnipeg and it was an awesome place. At at some local food joint, the smell emanating from the bathrooms was overwhelming the whole place but the food was good. As we were leaving this guy suggested we visit The Forks. It wasn't close but we had driven by there earlier, so we decided to go.

We park in this empty lot and other cars start to fill in around us. We were slowly getting prepared to walk over to the park, and another family parks next to us, and starts to walk towards the park too. All of the sudden they hurriedly get in their car and drive off. That's fine, we were still getting ready.

As soon as we finish getting ready (we had cameras, and stuff), we start hearing music. That's odd but obviously somethings happening, as many more cars are filling this lot. As we start to walk towards the park we notice the parade coming down the street to our right. It wasn't any ordinary parade, it was a massive gay pride parade. We stood in the median watching as thousands of paraders walked by. It was quite an awesome experience.

We must obviously have looked out of place as people kept quizzing us suspiciously. But we were there and we were going to enjoy it. I got plenty of great photos. As the end of parade reached us, we decided to follow it along. So we followed it to The Forks park (it might have a different name), and it was a huge festival with musicians and food and a stage with different shows and musical groups. It was quite the experience.

Among the whole trip which started off in simple Nebraska, and went north to Winnipeg and west to Vancouver and Seattle and back through Montana, Wyoming and Colorado, that might be the most memorable experience of the whole trip. The trip also included the hockey riots in Vancouver, a huge Chinese boat festival thing, and many other adventures.

Poker has to deal with the exact same 52 cards every shuffle, wheras Magic has to deal with 40+ different cards every shuffle. Poker has a clear advantage in the amount of code that has to be written for it and handled, so it can afford to spend more time in coding a slightly-more-complex shuffling loop.

But shuffling loops and randomly assigning position both end up achieving the same effect in that in every new draw you get a random card."

crankypants15,NeutralPolitics,1389982138.0,"On the one had, I agree with you. This is just taxing the rich to pay the (non-)working poor. 

OTOH, there are many poor who can't get jobs in the US anyway. The US suffered a permanent job loss in the debacle of 2008, especially in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing was an easy way to get a decent job without the expense or work of college. 

There are many people who want to work but cannot find jobs. Their unemployment insurance ran out (after what, 3 federal extensions?), so now the trend is to go on Social Security Disability. 

The key issue here, IMO, is ""the poor who want to work cannot get jobs in the US"". Why? IMO, a major reason is the bankers who messed with the economy, again. (see also 1929 crash). 

I think the best way to solve the problem of the poor is to create more jobs, but raising the minimum wage destroys jobs. And intense competition from overseas prevents some jobs (like mfg) from staying in the US. 

Companies cannot reduce current executive pay bonuses (to pay for Obamacare or higher minimum wages, for example) because those are contractual obligations (assuming certain metrics are met). And execs will continue to demand bonus opportunities in the long-term. 

At this point, things are so bad, I just don't know what to do. 

**My solution**

Make a federal jobs program. People get their ""basic income"" or whatever you want to call it, only if they work 40 hrs a week on a federal job program. Give them anything to do: clean up city streets, clean up dirty lots, remove broken down houses, shovel snow, rake leaves, cut grass, improve parks and trails, anything. Have them go around and give people hugs. I don't care. They will also be taxed on their income. 

I cannot support free money for no work which is the current dominant US welfare model.

Malcolm_Sex,INTP,1389982427.0,"Haha, oh boy.  **Note: long** 

In elementary school, I was asked to tutor my peers when they needed help with lessons.  I loved it, because I loved learning.  In K-5, your grades don't mean shit, you're just there to learn stuff.  I was able to help others, engross myself in material that I enjoyed, and got a huge ego boost as a bonus.  My parent very seriously considered trying to skip me ahead a year, but decided against.

In middle school, I was placed in all of the available honors classes, and was also put in a gifted program (which replaced our ""homeroom"" block) in which I and maybe 12-15 other students were basically free to make up the curriculum, primarily focusing on sciences and literature.  Upon finishing middle school, my parents were asked to meet with the director of that gifted program, and were told that I may have developmental issues, because I was occasionally blatantly disrespectful and did not play well with many other students outside of class.  They scoffed and called her a hack.

In high school, I was again placed in every accelerated course, and I took every other opportunity to enroll in advanced courses.  I graduated valedictorian, but did all of my homework the day it was due, subtly ridiculed teachers I didn't agree with, and routinely blew off quizzes if they didn't endanger my straight A's.  I was involved in debate, track, band, theater, student council, academic bowl (**edit** - it's like team Jeopardy), and board game club.  Every year, I applied for National Honor Society, and every year I was rejected.  My parents requested a meeting with our NHS chair, and they were told that I was not mature enough to be inducted.  They scoffed and called her a hack.  In my graduation speech, I not-so-subtly insulted the club and its members.

College, I failed *abysmally*.  I had never needed to study in my life, I had never been subjected to a specialized structured curriculum, and as a result, I graduated after over 5 years, with a 2.5 gpa.  Not as bad as you might think, considering I attended one of the top 10 engineering programs in the country.  But in no way was I prepared for having to actually try.

Did I struggle with school?  Only when it mattered. But for two reasons - structure and people - which both took the fun away.

I still don't know whether those 'hacks' were on to something."

However, if he gets the opening salvo I'd think the far right Musketeer  goes down to two Crossbows and a charge from (perhaps both) Conquistadors. The Treb on the far left can then get taken by the crossbow and conquistador on the left. 

If he gets both of his flanking Conqs moved up, he can bring his swords forward which means the Crossbows behind move up as well and are now ready to do business."

I would suggest adding that during base construction though, because you should have to build a dog house before you can get a dog. Then you should be able to use them as either hunting or guard dogs. If they see humans, they should bark to alert you, but only if they happen to be out of their dog house. If they are in the house, they are dormant so they cannot aid you. If you have them come with you, they should be able to track feces. "

I understand the attraction that these kind of ideas have on the manosphere. Men tend to be more confidence. ""Overconfident"" as some may say. Supposedly, if gov't got out of the way, people with inherent/natural advantages would flourish.

If OP came from a populist background, he might understand better why some people support a strong state. In populist countries where the state controls media, it's not uncommon to be affected by ideotainment that centers around crime, poverty, wealth disparity, foreign aggression, etc… all things that a strong central gov't are supposed to protect you from.

The gov't often doesn't do shit anyway, but this still brings up the point that people's fears of these issues are real. That is why the propaganda works. The problems are real and do happen. Even if everyone within the country ""played nice"" and tried to implement a stateless solution like anarcho-capitalism, it doesn't guarantee shit unless other nations are playing by the same rules. This is partially why Trotsky thought communism had to become global. Everyone has to play by the same rules.

Other changes: No more having to curl or straighten my hair (wavy hair problems) for an hour, styling my hair was optional (and would take 5 minutes and a little bit of hair wax), I felt lighter, it was always out of my face, and just a general feeling of happiness, freedom, and sassiness.

I started out playing top as well and have been learning how to jungle lately. The last month and a half i've played about 95% jungle matches and i'm starting to understand more and more about the mechanics and how to read matches.

Here is the problem. Some people are so fucking entitled and piss poor at the game that they make it out to be my fault every time they over extend and get fucked.

It's my fault every time they get ganked.

It's my fault when a gank doesn't go our way.

In some peoples eyes i can do no fucking right and it pisses me off, because YOU fucked up.

When their adc and top-laner is getting fed and our mid-laner is under farmed and pushed to the tower, because their mid-laner is getting full on babysat because they are the least competent player on the team, then i'll glance at the team score of 3-18 (at 17 minutes mind you) and i'll just realize this is a loss, so i stop wasting my time, i leave the game and i go do something else.

You played with an asshole, but there are times when there is no reason to sit it out. I'm almost happier that they get secured a loss because i leave.

itsacalamity,relationship_advice,1389982922.0,"I think one of the biggest lessons a lot of people learn between 20 and 30 is how absolutely important sexual compatibility is, and attitudes towards sex.

Some of the biggest mistakes I've seen my friends make is to marry someone with the thought that marriage would change things. Then five years later they get a divorce, because one person realizes they don't want to spend the rest of their live begging for sex or feeling alone and isolated. 

It's obvious you love this girl, but just because a relationship works on many levels doesn't mean that the levels it doesn't work on aren't important. You have to talk to her about this in a way that doesn't just let her apologize and shrug it off; make it really clear that you're thinking about the long term, you don't understand her actions, and it's making you feel awful.

He might like trying it on for size and writing about a character who believes it strongly, but that doesn't mean the writer himself is as sure about it as Cohle seems to be.

Theungry,AskMen,1389982966.0,"&gt;that is incorrect, the driver at the tie is actually responsible, and it is their insurance that takes the hit

My policy covers anyone who drives my car at my request.  I have Geico.

&gt;No, because all the inner city gang violence would push the costs onto me, because surprise surprise! The gangbagers neglected to buy gun insurance! and neglected to ask for a background check when selling it to his homie, and neglected to abide by the magazine restriction. Who would have guessed.

Insurance doesn't work like that.  They charge based on their individual risk factors for their payouts.  They don't charge for expenses they aren't covering.  It's not like medical insurance where you're charged for the average of everyone in your group plan, but everyone in your region is entitled to ER care that has to be accounted for financially by medical system.  For most insurance (homeowners/car/property/physical trainer) It's only the relevant liabilities you represent that determine your rates.

&gt;You get your car insurance from private corporations, not the government. You know that right?

I am beginning to suspect you do not own a car.  You are required by the government to prove you have insurance to register a vehicle.  Have you never experienced this?  Have you never held an insurance policy?

&gt;""The fact that they are an exception is an absurdity given their potential for harm.""

&gt;And yet that potential goes unrealized, except in the outlier cases such as gang violence and the very rare event of someone attempts a mass shooting

Well in that case, as I said, the costs should be quite minimal."

Also:
&gt;I men were given paternity leave as well and gender roles less rigid in defining who ought to care for children, I think this would be much less of a problem.

I really don't think this matters, at least not anymore. I mean, obviously the non-primary-caregiver should still get some more paid leave in the US, but I mean men can choose to be stay-at-home dads if they want, just as women can choose to be the primary breadwinner in the house. The fact that one gender chooses one over the other more frequently and vice versa I don't believe is a problem so long as people aren't locked into them. Gender roles themselves aren't an issue if you're capable of subverting them, and it's 2014 - subverting gender roles is celebrated these days in civilized parts of the world. Less so for men, obviously, but with third wave feminism imploding on itself the MR movement is gaining traction and before we know it we'll be getting 
more and more egalitarian. 

And even at our most egalitarian I'm willing to bet most of the childcare will be performed by women, and most of the physically demanding work will be done by men - and there's nothing wrong with that."

ARUKET,truegaming,1389983686.0,"What was so bad about the kid scenes? Movies do stuff like that all the time and it works for them.

For example, in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made, there's a scene where Clint Eastwood stumbles upon a dying, suffering soldier left alone in a decrepit house. And Clint covers him in a coat and lets him have some smokes from the cigar. This character has no relevance to the entire plot but it shows the horrors of war and the kindness that men can have for one another.

Sure it was a little overly dramatic in ME3 but we shouldn't act like you have to develop a character for 3 hours before we're allowed to feel bad about their deaths.

Which is presumably why EU4 lets you attack other countries without any causus belli at all, if you so choose. EU4 models a time period where nations exist closer to what's sometimes referred to as a state of anarchy between each other, so the only thing preventing a given nation from doing whatever the hell it wants is a) its finite resources, obviously, and b) its concern for its diplomatic standing among the other nations (and c, internal political capital, I suppose, as I believe in EU4 war weariness increases faster if you don't have a causus belli). As anyone who's played EU knows, the diplomatic penalties for attacking without a causus belli in that game are severe."

7h3Hun73r,leagueoflegends,1389983871.0,"That thing your overlooking is... Your league literally means NOTHING.  It's a comparative rating system. 

 If you were ranked in plat with 2000 MMR before the reset, you were playing against other people with ~2000 MMR.  which could be diamonds on a losing streak, or that one guy in bronze 5 that dodged all his placement matches but won every other game he played.  After the reset, you have 1600 MMR. (or whatever #)  as you pointed out, everyone had the same reset, so you're being matched with the SAME EXACT PEOPLE.  if you win more games, your MMR will go up.  If you lose more games, your MMR will go down.  regardless, your still playing against the same people you would have before the reset (aprox.)

The only thing that is changing is the arbitrary label they put on your MMR.  if you're in the range of MMRs riot decides is plat (or whatever), you'll be labeled plat (or whatever). 

The label is just a pride thing, it's easier to say ""im gold"" than it is to say ""my ELO is 1350, which means i'm 1000 elo from playing against a pro player""

As far as I can tell, the only thing that will change is everyone that had over 1200 MMR will go down in the leage system.  which I think riot wanted to do, because (correct me if i'm wrong)  the bell curve of players to ranking was weighted higher than silver.

The externalities of those items are neglible in comparison to gun accidents/misuse.

&gt;When was the last time you needed a background check, show identification, or proof of homeowner insurance to buy bleech, tylenol, or windex?

As I already mentioned those items already have government involvement in risk management appropriate to their level of risk.  They are actually great examples of liability being appropriately channeled.  Just because they are not the same types of risk management relevant to guns does not mean they are unregulated items.

&gt;There is a reason many guns bought now a days have giant ""Read the manual"", ""Gun can fire without magazine"", and ""Guns can cause death"" both in the manual and printed on the guns themselves. It's a felony most everywhere if a child gets has access to a gun and causes an accident.
California extorts gun manufacturers to re-certify their guns as ""safe"" every year. In fact this year they implemented ""micro-printing[1] "" on the firing pin, a technology that isn't proven to do anything, and really doesn't actually exist. Of course, the police are exempt.

bunker_man,Megaten,1389984295.0,"Satan / Zayin, Hikawa, Naoya.

Runners up: Anguished one, Mastema, YHVH, Adachi. demonic Akira.

I think if you take a lenient / optimistic view of the law ending of SMTII, Zain is actually one of the most interesting characters of the series. (Nevermind that the games make that hard to do.) He starts out grown as a kind of guard whose only job is to follow orders, working for the center thinking they're right. He quickly realize they're an elitist fascist society who plans on basically letting the elite survive and killing everyone else. So he rescues the workers and leads a revolution, slaughtering the leaders and taking over the ark the elite made for themself. However, the world is still dying and on the verge of being taken over by demons. So even though he wanted to save everyone as a human, he realizes that that optimism cannot actually work out, and push really came to shove, and that there were limited ark spaces. So for the future of the world, he puts on anyone he can fit out of whom he rescued,allowing gabriel and YHVH to choose explicitly those who were the most selfless, and willing to have their evil opportunistic side purified. He thinks he's doing what he has to, but he still feels guilt over it, knowing it was a hard decision. Since that iteration of YHVH had become so corrupted that it did not even feel guilt or think anything was wrong with the plan, his last act was to recyce that too, restarting the world without corruption. Note that since he became an angel of judgement, and he sees a world of constant judgement (like the center had become) as a dystopia, he decides that he has no place there, and kills himself as well.

Another interesting thing is the distinction of when you fight him in neutral and chaos. For neutral, he still sees you as a friend and turns back into his human form to tell you why he was doing what he had to. He feels sorry for those who had to die, and sorry for you too, since you are now one of them. It almost sounds like he's crying when he talks about how it's too late. But in chaos, he sees you as having always been part of the problem. You are one of the corrupt who led to the destruction of the world in the first place, so he has no sympathy, openly ridiculing you. His same interna battle over doing what he thought he had to probably still exists, except now since you are chaos he believes that you would not even be able to understand his feelings. Either way, he dies lamenting over the fact that you lost your path, and that the world may likely take a dark path.

-

For hikawa, I think he was an interesting twist on the law hero. There's not much to say about him, however.

For Naoya, his cunning, his appearance; everything about him just indicates spectacularness.

Anguished one had an ambience that was hard not to respect.

Mastema has an outrageously cool appearance. That, and his cunning are pretty fantastic. Chaos ending of SJ notwithstanding, it's also interesting that his character development shows a kind of alternate side to how one can approach lawful goals.

YHVH, well... who can dislike that face? And the overall humor of the whole situation.

Adachi, is just funny. Not only that, his backstory makes him kind of sympathetic, even once you realize he's more or less pure corrupted selfishness.

As for demonic akira... he's more or less the only totally sympatetic full-law character in the entire series, save for a few KIND OF exceptions, like Remiel, and maybe IIs gabriel. That, combined with his woobie nature makes for a very cool combo.

Same shit with school shootings and people pushing gun reform.

In this case, *I* would explain it as a teenager making a shit mistake, not in running over leaves as captain hindsight would say, but in covering it up. She *was* scared, if not just in denial.

It just seems that poor, race/gender/legality aside, always get shafted hard by the system. Where otherwise it's a case of ""affluenza"" or like the other article I just saw where the mayor of a town got a DUI and was filmed on dash cam just fucking around, gets off with a $100 fine and a slap on the wrist.

Neopopulas,dayz,1389984454.0,"Labels are bad, i think. People are people. People are not one thing. People don't (generally) ONLY do one thing.

I know i don't, i can't speak for everyone, but in generalities, people do lots of things, they rarely only ever do one thing (but they can).

I'll run around trying to help newspawns, they usually don't want my help, normally they just want to run to balota or their body or something, while i wish more people would 'play along' and treat it less like an arcade game they need to reset, i can respect their choices.

If they don't want nothing to do with us, they want to fight us. Either verbally (why?) or they try and punch or attack us because they don't care if they die again, but i spent a few hours trying to get this stuff, so i care. So i have to shoot them or risk dying to some punches.

I eventually get bored of this attitude and run around trying to hunt geared up people, maybe this makes me an asshole, but maybe not. 'bandit' maybe? Specialized serial killer? Who knows. But that usually ends in people dying, its the way of things.

Its hard to talk to people who have guns because everyone is so on edge, thats the game so far.

FurryButt,AskReddit,1389984460.0,"Back in the early 2000s I once chit-chatted with some random person on the internet for a bit. A rather deep conversation about opinions, beliefs, feelings and such. Then toward the end they asked where I was from and I said the country in the Caribbean where I was from, and the person replied, ""... there are white people there, right?"" Almost as though he was horrified to be talking to a brown person all that time. It's interesting to me that people need to know that there are white people in the Caribbean. And in general, as per my other comment in this thread, they associate countries with a non-white majority to be third-world hellholes where everyone (presumably except the few white people) are poverty-stricken and desperate to go live in America."

Thinking of all the effort a decent-looking women might have to put in in order to be ""allowed"" to be given a challenge by a male dominated cohort all bent on doing her share of the work so that she sleeps with them out of gratitude seems so tiring! And that isn't even addressing the fact that a student may not even have the knowledge yet to actually know what they should be pushing for in terms of their own education! It takes a while before a student can understand just how much they still don't understand. Like, the thought of fighting for a decent amount of work to do with people bent on making you their debtor must be demoralizing. 

Why aren't these men treating their female co-students in the same way as the males? It sounds to me like he just placed whatever blame he was trying to put onto women right back onto the men who are being sexist and overly helpful to female students so that they can then choose or be forced into not getting as much out of the courses as they should.

Sofestafont,MensRights,1389984687.0,"I really don't know how it works. I know many reservations are autonomous and have their own police force and schools. Many illegal immigrants come in through a reservation on the Canadian border because there is no border enforcement on the Native's lands. Some have casinos because they don't have to follow ""their"" state's laws. I'm sure the Federal government throws money at the problem.

I just know the alcohol thing because I was reading about a theory on how they have no genetic tolerance for alcohol because it was never apart of their society before the European powers came.

I know the reservation life is bad though. You want find which demographic has the highest unemployment, highest of a specific crime, drug use, etc it is generally Native Americans."

1. A rigid military style command structure creates smothering inefficiency. I prefer efficiency. I just wouldn't fit in the US military. I think out of the box and am focused on getting shit done. The military appears to be focused on following orders, and that is not the same as getting shit done in many cases. 
I simply need more flexibility to get shit done. Stay out of my way and let me do my job. I can follow orders just fine, but not stupid orders. 
2. Skills from the US military do not transfer well, if at all, to civilian life. An army medic cannot just jump in and be a paramedic, they need additional schooling to get certification. Why should people go into the military if they can't transfer skills? 
3. Basic skills like a mechanic or electrical repairman will transfer, but the military uses very different hardware. So only basic concepts will transfer. I.e. vehicles need fuel to run. The military uses different hardware and software for communications, for example, for safety and security reasons. And often their hardware is hardened or specially designed. Not just at the case level (case which holds the electronics) but even down to the chip level.

If she's ""excited"" to perform one of her compulsions, she doesn't have OCD.From Wikipedia on OCD:&gt;OCD is often confused with the separate condition obsessive–compulsive personality disorder (OCPD). OCD is ego dystonic, meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's self-concept.[53][54] Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is ego syntonic—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with his or her self-image, or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them, and may be riddled with anxiety.[55] By contrast **people with OCPD** are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they **tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.**[55]Of course, it's possible I just misinterpreted OP."

Big counterpoint, considering the frequency with which he's used in a pick-and-roll. Even though he's fourth in that area, I wouldn't consider him an elite elbow shooter; teams are giving him that shot uncontested and his release is low and slow.

At the same time, teams going under on those screens would suggest that his field-goal percentage around the rim (55 percent) is deflated, which explains why that area's not red for him in the Goldsberry graph even though we all know he's a great finisher. Converging those two into pretty much the same percentage (51 from the elbows versus 55 around the rim) suggests teams have been playing him pretty smartly."

thro_way,funny,1389984924.0,"I think you're misunderstanding the reasons behind sexual assignment.  Sexual assignment is not an ideological attempt to police the child's gender expression or deny the existence of intersexed people.  Instead, it's done because people in the gray area tend to face all sorts of emotional and social issues, and pushing them into black or white seems to lead to a higher quality of life than leaving them as intersexed.

In response to your other point, the terms man and woman are more commonly defined in regards to sex, rather than gender.  Think of how common it is to hear someone who's sex is male but gender is female described as a man, for instance."

AnJu91,askscience,1389985011.0,"What /u/Hellogoodbye37 says is correct. There are very few brain areas active during sleep, in fact the frontal region is almost entirely inactive. 

These are some of the most notable parts of the brain that are active and characteristic for dreaming (REM sleep): 

* **The Pons** (for regulating the physiological aspects of dreaming, as well as initiating PGO waves which accompany REMs and are characteristic for neurological dream activity)
* **The Thalamus** (generally a part of your brain that works as a relay, not sure what it does during dreaming, perhaps it's involved in the network optimisation process that dreaming is, or is responsible for binding and correlating features and information together)
* **The visual cortex** (this is where all your dream content is from. A theory is that networks in this part is being modified, and during this process parts are activated and its corresponding content somehow implemented in your dream perhaps due to the thalamocortical activity)
* And lastly the **Parahippocampal gyrus (PHG)** and the **amygdala** are activated, which are known to be essential for the memory function, which aligns well with the idea that dreaming consolidates and modifies memory.

The above 5 regions are based on a fMRI study done in 2008 by Miyauchi et al. that researched the neurological correlates of Rapid Eye Movements (REM) that accompanies dreams. From the fMRI only 7 regions of interest came up, of which 2 are not unique to REMs but also waking eye saccades, leaving only the above 5. As you can see activity of the frontal regions are not directly involved in the process of dreaming, and according to Hobson (2009) during dreaming 2 areas are also explicitly deactivated: the **dorsalateral prefrontal cortex** (DL-PFC), which is strongly related to executive functions, and the **Posterior Cingulate**, a highly functionally connected area which is associated with awareness.
 
Another neurological reason for why you're not conscious during dreaming or able to reflect or analyse on your dream content during the dream: 
The brain communicates through neurotransmitters, of which some are mono-amines, like the familiar serotonin and dopamine. During dreaming mono-aminergic activity *decreases* and acetylcholinergic activity *increases*, creating a totally different brain (Hobson, 2009). 
In other words, **a dreaming brain is worlds apart from a waking brain**. The limited active areas in your brain, and the totally different neurotransmitter dynamics in the brain, don't allow conscious perception or *most* (thanks /u/symon_says) of the  mental functions you normally are able to use consciously when awake, nor allow you to be conscious at all, even though during a dream it might seem so.

thogervo,AskReddit,1389985042.0,"This was **AGES** ago, but back in fourth grade I made a California Mission for a model assignment. Of course, every was making there's out of sugar cubes and popsicle sticks and I think one kid used real sticks for his, but I wanted mine to be different. I wanted mine to pop. With as fierce a determination my little fourth grade will could muster, I got to work planning, writing, plotting. 

I arrived at school the next day with my mother in tow, carrying the project behind me, giant smile on my face because I knew I was going to get an A+. On the outside, my model looked like your standard fourth grade creation: shitty glue jobs, poster board sides and lasagna roofing. But I had a secret. Inside my mission I had placed an audiotape of monks and bells and other missiony stuff. I was thrilled, and I had gone to painstaking effort not to blab about my secret weapon.

Come presentation time, I whipped my model out and turned around, making sure no one saw me open the crackling roof and hit play.


It was quiet at first as everyone waited in tense silence, and as I made a mute fool of myself with the biggest grin that ever grinned. Then with a booming ""boing"" I was literally saved by the bell as my audiotape kicked in and took everyone's breath away. My satisfaction was complete as the sweet throaty serenade of many monk voices rose and rose, lifting my project into the realm of the highest grade of them all.

raziphel,recipes,1389985172.0,"when you make spaghetti sauce from scratch (ie sauted onion, garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, bay leaves, crushed red pepper, glass of red wine, a large can of crushed tomatoes and a can of tomato paste), add a few things: 

* 1 sliced carrot, with the onions: makes it slightly sweeter
* 1 can of anchovies, finely chopped, or a splash of balsamic vinegar: gives the sauce some depth
* a pinch of sugar to the tomatoes: cuts the acidity
* a pinch of cinnamon: gives it a slightly curry flavor

the longer you simmer, the smoother the sauce will be.

remember to not rinse the noodles off, but to add them to the sauce, with a scoop of the noodle water, and let that simmer for 5 minutes or so.  this allows the sauce to stick to the noodles.

pick out the bay leaves before you serve the food.

variant: vodka pasta

replace the wine with vodka (stoli), and add a half-pint of heavy cream, plus whatever cheese you like (parmesan and moxxarella)."

Looking at both lists should take baseball bats and bicycles right out of the conversation.  Poison accidents are unspecified between over the counter cleaners and prescription overdoses or illegal drug overdoses, so that data isn't really useful.

SelfDeprecating,nba,1389985317.0,"No, it's a good counterargument. Because they're giving him that shot, they're protecting against an even higher-percentage shot at the rim. Look at how his shot chart around the rim is green and not red. That's because they're giving him the shot on the elbows (51 percent) to challenge the shot at the rim (55 percent). Optimal defense would have those two be equal; good idea to give him the elbow shot since they're both worth two points and he'd score more frequently if the rim were relatively less protected.

It's why LeBron is shooting 40+ percent from three. He's not nearly as good a three-point shooter as Stephen Curry or Ray Allen all things being equal, but his shooting percentages are higher from three because teams would rather him take the relatively open outside shot—even one he makes at such a high rate—because he's so deadly efficient in the paint."

This is a great point, and something I hadn't thought about, but I think it's a very valid observation, even as someone who loves to own books.

SCphotog,photography,1389985465.0,"Composition, to me is about effectively causing the viewer to see what you want them to. 

Using the lines, objects, depth of field, foreground, background and subject all together to achieve that goal.

I love to play with dirty frames and DOF to get folks to look where I want them to... to force the identification of the subject.

Hope that helps.

One of my own personal favorites as an example...

http://steveaycockphotography.com/img/s3/v44/p692819111-5.jpg

Outside of comp... I think one of the best ways to grow out of being stale or in a rut is to go photograph some things outside of your element. Things you wouldn't normally shoot. Anything outside of your comfort zone that will be a challenge to your expertise.

I shoot a lot of skateboarding... It turned out to be an immense challenge and rewarding foray in photographing a wine bottle for a vineyard, for a client of mine.

bleeker_street,Advice,1389985484.0,"Hey!  So I could tell you that you're a special snowflake and things will all work out, but I think you're too old for that. 

So, instead, you're a young person in charge of what happens to you in life.  If you want to get with a girl, you're going to have work at that goal just like anything else you want. 

In five months you won't be part of the two man tag team that you and your bestie who is apparently awesome.  The lack of comparison will help. It's not going to be enough though. 

First thing is you say that you're ugly.  Maybe you are.  Not necessarily a huge problem for you.  Through the luck of being a guy you are under less social pressure to be good looking.  Next, you can go go the gym, dress better, make sure you shave well, take care of your skin, and have a nice hair cut.  Now, if you're still ugly enough after all that you can try a bit of makeup - I know what you're thinking - but, I know at least ten straight adult men that use a little bit of concealer under their eyes to deal with hereditary dark circles.  Moles, skin tags, and pimple scars can all be dealt with with localized proceedures for reasonable prices.  After all that, I'm thinking you're not that ugly. 

The second part is more important.  You don't really sell yourself in this post.  Granted you're asking for help, but still.  Women like confidence, not arrogance, but straight up confidence.  What are you good at?  People skills? Writing? Technology? Humour?  Highlight those things. Women want to know what you bring to the table.  So bring it. 

Finally, when you get to college look for women that are interested in the same things, women that are naturally going to be inclined to think you're cool for being into whatever it is you're into rather than trying to win over a girl you don't have anything in common with.  

And, don't worry about not having had a girlfriend.  I promise you it's not that big of a deal.  College is a way more fun place to experiment.  Good luck. "

myrrlyn,teslore,1389985878.0,"Before I begin, let's review torque/moment. The torque or moment (one spins, one twists, but they're the same mathematically) is a combination of the applied force, the distance over which the force is applied, and the angle between force and application. The least force is required when the distance is greatest and the angle is 90 degrees.

Similarly, in TES, entities are far stronger acting within their purpose than without. Boethiah's plots are stronger than Mara's, and Sheogorath's mathematics have nothing on Julianos. So on and so forth.

Boethiah is the Prince of Plots, revolution, and change. It's the most Lorkhanic of the Princes and likes to consider itself a successor to him. Trinimac is a warrior of civility and honor and might, which as we've seen tend to be week to plots and revolt. Furthermore, Trinimac was an Aedra mired in Mundus, while Boethiah was not. Boethiah is a vastly powerful Prince in its own right, so the fight was rather like if a weaker man came across Arnold Schwarzenegger trapped in a bog.

The definition of ""is"" is unhelpful when dealing with Trinimac, so I'm going to have to use a less concise example.

There is a direct path between Trinimac-that-was and Malacath-that is, historically. This path is unbroken. By this definition, Malacath is Trinimac.

There is no subset of Malacath that is also a subset of Trinimac. Malacath is not Trinimac-wrapped-in-Mundus-and-filth. Malacath cannot throw this filth off and arise as Trinimac. Malacath is Malacath to his core. By this definition, Malacath is not Trinimac.

**That said**, what Malacath is, as an entity, is a corruption and inversion of what Trinimac was, as an entity. Malacath is defined to be a mockery and a mirror of what Trinimac was. So in summary, Trinimac was changed at Boethiah's hands entirely to be something else, but they are the same historical path. Malacath is not a demon dancing in Trinimac's spot while Trinimac is dead or captive. Malacath is not Trinimac in a mask.

I emphasize this because it's a very important distinction and one that apparently I have to make because I am informed that *Lord of Souls* portrayed Malacath in a misleading manner.

____

Malacath is every bit as strong as Trinimac, in terms of raw power. However, while Trinimac was weakened by being *in* Mundus, Malacath is weakened by being *out* of it. The former case saw Trinimac's essence sapped by creation, while the latter throws a barrier between Malacath in Oblivion and the mortals on Nirn. Since Malacath is Trinimac, in the historical sense, this makes sense.

Modern Malacath rarely exercises his power in directly visible ways, tending to smite those who anger him and withdraw his blessing from those who fail him, but probably the most upfront showing of his power is the fact that he cursed all men to die at around a century of life (Orkey is Malacath, yes). That's a pretty tremendous display, really. And because Malacath is Malacath and no run of misfortune goes uncompounded, Shor tucked the Orcs under that curse as well and there being fewer of them, it was more potent for each, so Orcs die at around sixty.

Trinimalacath and Shorkhan have a lovely tradition of destroying each other.

So to answer your two actual questions:

1. Boethiah doesn't dither around, it was acting in its sphere, and Trinimac was mired in Mundus.

2. They're the same, though Malacath has constraints and concerns that keep him from stomping everywhere, and both are pretty strong. All Four Corners of the House of Troubles should be on your ""do not screw with"" list, and Malacath is not the runt of the litter."

Equally, as a writer, the genitalia has rarely crossed my mind about my characters. But then, I'm a bit shit at sex scenes so always fade to black, so maybe that's why that part of my brain has never ignited.

Anyway, part of the point is that no one did ask about Kvothe. I don't know what your views on feminism in genre as a whole are, but for me, the issue is a deeply rooted and many tendrilled thing. Like I said to the other person who was replying to me - I don't personally feel that offended by this comment, but I can see why people do.

The issue being such a big deal, that small comments that let people ""get away"" with oversexualisation is a bit of a tough one, because every action counts in a battle that most people have given up with.

I mean, I'm very happy to talk feminism in genre whenever you like, but at the moment, my objection comes from the fact he deemed it necessary to answer at all, in a thread where he didn't answer all the questions, why include that one? Why give people more canon fodder by which to make Fela a sexual object, when she is already this gorgeous, shapely lady?

Luckily I did because a couple weeks later, I hooked up with a friend of mine and we've been seeing each other ever since. And he compliments me all the time, talks to me quite a bit and has even told me if I play my cards right, I could land myself a pretty sexy boyfriend (I love his wit).

Regarding your audio, what was your set up? I'm in my final semester of a film BA and one thing that's happened on every student production so far is that the sound is abysmal. I've never been an audio guy, but over December I started reading some things and picked up a Rode NTG2 (and accessories) + Tascam DR-100 for myself to start practicing getting better audio. I know plenty of people that can get decent images, but so far we're all lacking on the sound part, and I aim to make up for that.

What was your budget for this, if you don't mind me asking? What was your scheduling like?

What was it like working with kids of that age group?

Also, I'm interested in hearing the answer for what the hole was for. I have an idea, and part of me wants to just let it be and the other part wants the answer.

Born Sinner is a good album, I liked it, but I don't think it was that great per say. One of the main reasons is the fact that Cole's work always sounds monotone. I think one of the biggest reasons that is because he produces all the tracks. He needs to have some variety and work with lots of other producers who will also make big calls.

Suicide is also a rather common form of death here being the 10th most common cause over all and (if I'm correct) the 3rd most common cause of death among teens. While that does not mean the issues in your country are less important, it does mean that socialism is not the cause of what you listed.

Also what do you mean by ""my money being used to kill innocent people and jail drug users""? I'm assuming that you do not like your country's drug conviction laws and odds are I agree with you on that but you can't pick and choose what laws your money goes to. It's the law and it should be enforced until the law changes. The killing part I'm still confused about though.

And you have never lived and worked in a capitalist country if you think companies would never refuse skilled workers. We have plenty of people who are overqualified for their jobs right now because they cannot find work in their field of study and just as many who are completely incompetent at their current level but no one else can advance because either they have befriended someone higher up or they just push blame on everybody else for their mistakes at work.

azayii,Fantasy,1389986257.0,"I don't think it's a bad thing to sexualise - but the fact it, the balance is totally skewed. It's not an even thing. Slanted in the favour of guys is a total understatement of what it is. Sex is a healthy, important subject. Objectifying women to sexualisation constantly, is not and is pretty unhealthy for any girls who grow up in genre.

In George R.R. Martin, there is constant reference to Dany's ""boobs beneath her tunic"" or whatever she is reading. I'm not talking about the sex scenes, because I don't mind those, it's more that even static, women's boobs are talked about for no good reason. We are sexual in almost every context, always having looks and breasts and other parts of us spoken about.

And we're even sexual when we're not. If the women are ugly or fat, then we are judged on the fact no one would want to have sex with me. Brienne of Tarth is near absolutely constantly spoken about in the context of being ugly. Who the hell cares? We got she was ugly from the moment we met her, and yet it is emphasised near constantly.

I mean, this is just talking about the first two books - I'm only reading the third now, so probably not the best place to go for reference, but the one at the forefront of my mind."

Nolite_Te_Bastardes,ClashOfClans,1389986274.0,"I will weigh in as an elder on this one-- we take ""bad"" donations very seriously. If you were getting troops that you did not request, it is up to you to let us know what and who did it. That way we know when players are not following rules and requests. I don't recall seeing you state that at all, so we couldn't have possibly dealt with it. If you received bad donations, I apologize, but I would be very surprised if it happened ""a lot of the time"". That is just not like our clan. If someone did it to you, they likely did it to others, and they would get kicked pretty quickly. 

We were notified on multiple occasions that you gave wrong troops, and this began immediately after you joined. We overlooked it because you were pretty active, and we appreciate having you in the clan. However, we can't overlook that kind of thing forever. Also, receiving bad troops is never an excuse to *give* bad troops to someone else. Ever. Especially to the player you did it to before you were kicked-- he is a very good donator, friendly player, and didn't deserve a random drop. 

We do not show a bias to those who have been in the clan a long time. We appreciate new members, and as I said, we overlooked your bad donations a number of times. I am sorry it didn't work out, and I am sorry you felt this post was necessary. And speaking to the ""it's just a game""-- yeah, it is. And now I had to spend time out of my real-life day writing up a defense of a clan that is very good and very friendly... Because you took it that seriously. 

It is just a game, and I hope you find another clan and continue to happily clash.

It is in fact a failure of logic to attack the person rather then the idea (Ad hominem), And that is what these comment propose by assuming people lack intelligence when the have come to a different conclusion. 

What i am suggesting is that if you do not know the origin of someones views it is hard to discuss with any real conviction the subject matter.

I_Enjoy_Taffy,bostonceltics,1389986397.0,"I've said this in a number of threads on this subreddit, but I am absolutely ok with Rondo being traded, in fact I hope it happens. Here is why:

You cannot win an NBA championship led by a PG. It just doesn't happen nowadays. Chris Paul whom many consider to be the best PG in the league has made it to the Conference Semifinals only 2 times, and has NEVER made the Conference Finals. Derrick Rose has made it out of the Conference Quarterfinals ONCE (not including the year he went down with the ACL tear) and ended up making the Conference Finals. What do these guys have in common? They've never even sniffed the NBA Finals. And why is that? Because if your team revolves around a point guard, you are not going to succeed. If the point guard is a complement to other players then you have something (ex. Westbrook to Durant, Parker to Duncan/Ginobili). But, if your team is point guard centric then it's just going to fail miserably.

In the past 20 years only **TWO** point guards have won Finals MVP. Tony Parker and Chauncey Billups and neither of those two were the focal point of the team. They were surrounded by great players. Also, these two guys are score-first point guards. That is not Rondo's game, he is a pass-first PG through and through. To succeed in the NBA you need to surround a team around a Forward (LeBron, Durant, Garnett, Duncan) or SG (Kobe), or even a Center if he's that good. The last thing you want to do is surround your team around a point guard.

Look at Steve Nash, he had been the star of the Phoenix Suns for years as THE guy. What did that get him? To the Conference Finals, but never the NBA Finals. He won some MVP awards, but would you rather championships or MVP awards? It just does not happen in this league."

An ""abortion is murder"" pin makes an extremely clear message towards a specific goal.  Believe it or not, there *are* moderate religious people who wear religious symbols but have much more liberal social positions on things like abortion.  Simply wearing a veil, turban, or kippa does not necessarily imply any specific political or social stance, and any attempt at the government to legally define religious symbols as having specific implicit meaning (which the PQ is doing as part of its justification for the proposed law) is a gross overreach of government into the realm of religion, where *government does not belong*."

itsmevichet,seduction,1389986525.0,"&gt; the quickest way to polarizing a woman

This is a good thing. You WANT to polarize people. You don't want wishy washy, gray area, pedestal building bullshit. Some women will hate you. You don't have to deal with them. You can say ""well, sorry for taking your time,"" and leave.

But if you want those women who are waiting for a guy like you, you need to be direct.

If a woman doesn't feel attraction to you within the first 30 seconds, no amount of tiptoeing and ""making the right moves"" thereafter will get her to change her mind (in 90 percent of cases). After that, I'd have to ask you why you're spending so much effort on a woman who doesn't show romantic curiosity about you.

That said, I'm going to make a distinction - **direct approaches versus being direct in your interactions.**

A direct approach is one way to display a combination of confidence and clear intentions. You went up to a girl specifically to talk to her. Both parties know that once you introduce yourself. It's considered bread and butter by many because if you match the girl's initial checklist for guys she'd like to meet (this could be anything, but common patterns are good grooming, good body language, steady speech, not afraid of kino), the direct approach is the shortest point from A to B.

The direct approach is never bad unless it results in an action where you've COST the woman something. Did you interrupt an important call? Are you making her late for a meeting? There are in fact some situations where this is case, but it's not the majority, ESPECIALLY if you're in a time and place where these situations are unlikely (club at night, daygame during lunch hour).

Zoom out a bit, though. To me, the direct approach is just a single tool in a larger toolbox that is all about **being direct**. You can wait for an opportunity to talk to a woman - after she's done with her phone call, or after you've established eye contact, or whatever. This can be VERY smart and good to do because you won't accidentally step on her toes, which makes you look more oblivious than confident.

However, AFTER you actually get in front of her, you better not be thinking ""I'm going to be as neutral and non-polarizing as possible."" I'd say stay away from discussing politics and religion, but beyond that, be memorable. Shit. The worst thing you can do is leave a woman having no opinion of you.

I would say 90 percent of the time, I do a direct approach. No introductions needed from other friends, no winging, no nothing. Just walking up, introducing myself, etc. The caveats I listed above apply.

100 percent of the time, I'm direct. I'm direct with my body language, I'm direct with kino, I'm LISTENING TO HER and PAYING ATTENTION TO HER REACTIONS TO MY ATTENTION. Is she digging it? Then I get even more direct.

Escalation is all about being direct, bro."

Nintendo is one of the only places left to go to get games that don't try so hard to be movies or ""gritty"" bullshit. There's a place for that (99% of modern AAA games) but Nintendo consoles are not that place.

IngwazK,EatCheapAndHealthy,1389986722.0,"I use a lot of different ones.  Some are my own creation, others is search around and find ones that arent too complicated and sound appealing.  For example, this week im going to try a vegetarian mushroom stroganoff and im adapting someone's spicy orange chicken glaze to use as an asian style orange chicken recipe.  

One of my own creation is hawaiian pork.  
3lbs pork shoulder roast  
Pineapple chunks  
Lots of onions  
Lots of peppers  
A few zucchini  
a few squash  
Other veggies you can think of that go well in asian style recipes.  
Cube the pork  
Pour in the juice from the cans of pineapple and maybe some soy sauce.  
Cook on low for 6 hours  
Add chopped up vegetables and fruits
Cook for an hour longer
Add cornstarch and water mixture to thicken if desired.  
Enjoy.

Good with rice.  Not the healthiest, but quick and easy.  

I use the same basic recipe for my hawaiian style fried rice, just use ground pork instead and cook it in a skillet while using pineapple juice to keep meat from burning and to marinade it.

Another great recipe is Salsa chicken.  
5lb chicken thighs  
2-3 large jars of salsa (Last time I did this, 2 jars wasn't really enough, so I'm going to try 3 next time.  The beans absorb a lot of moisture.  pick your spice.  I recommend medium)  
Lots of extra onions.  
Extra peppers  
1 lb of black beans (presoaked)  
1.5-2lb of frozen corn  
taco seasoning of your choosing.  

Instructions:  
Remove skin of chicken and place in crock pot  
Pour jars of salsa over chicken  
add a decent helping of taco seasoning (i would guess at least 3 Tbsp would be a good range.  it adds a good flavor).  
add black beans  
stir  
cook on low for 6 hours  
remove chicken thighs and shred the chicken thighs (if they're bone in, be careful to remove the bones and any cartilage.)  
add chicken back to the crock pot.  
add vegetables.  
cook for 1 hour.  
enjoy.  

Here is the mushroom stroganoff recipe I'm going to be trying.  I havent converted it to lbs yet and it's originally meant for 3 people.  the recipes I use usually serve at least 6 people.  

Serves 3  
500g mushrooms, sliced  
1 onion, diced  
1tbsp butter  
1 stock cube, made up in 600ml hot water  
2tbsp tomato ketchup  
3tsp paprika  
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced  
4tbsp sour cream (heaped)  
Handful fresh parsley, chopped  
In a large pan, melt the butter and gently cook the onion and mushroom for 5-10 minutes, until they are slightly softened and beginning to shrink in size, but are still not yet fully cooked. Transfer these to the slow cooker, and add the stock, kethcup, paprika and sliced garlic. Cook on high for 4 hours.  
When cooked, stir in the sour cream and chopped parsley.  
I liked my stroganoff as it was, but if you would like it to be thicker, just transfer it to a saucepan and simmer for 10 minutes to reduce it slightly.  
Serve with pasta or rice.  

Notes: when using a slow cooker, if the cook time is originally on low but you want it done faster, set it to high and halve the time.  The same works in reverse.  going to be at work all day but the recipes says cook on high for 4 hours?  cook it on low for 8.  

For recipes, /r/slowcooking is your friend.  Also, the search bar on here if you search for ""slowcooker"" ""crock pot"" or some variation of that, should turn up some recipes.  Also, a good ol' fashioned google search can usually turn up some interesting ideas.  Most recipes don't use enough enough vegetables for my taste, so I almost always add more that would compliment the flavors.  Zucchini and squash that are quartered make good additions to meals that are sweet or spicy."

Weapons, just like speech, demonstrations, and the press, are important to the liberty, security, and safety of the individual: with them, I have the potential ability to defend myself and my loved ones to the utmost if need be.  I wish people took the rest of our constitutionally protected rights just as seriously as they take the second amendment.

I'm fine with vetted, safe individuals, who've proven themselves competent to society (ie proper licensing, training, and whatnot) owning whatever weapons they damned-well please, but I understand that not everyone feels that way.  Therefore, I'm good with the laws that we have because I feel they're a good compromise.

Remember, there are only three ways to get someone to alter their position on any given subject: words, demonstrations, and *violence.*  You either convince them their position is wrong, you show them their position is wrong, or you *force* them to accept your point of view.  There are of course merits and flaws to all of these methods (and times when they are or are not appropriate), but there are times when the reasonable person must be able to choose between all three.  By removing any of those options, you severely restrict what that person can do to promote his or her own life, liberty, and persuit of happiness.

If that other person's position is to ""cause harm"" to you, you'd better be able to defend yourself.  *Hopefully* you can do this with nonviolent means, but well... not everyone is reasonable or willing to value your opinion.

I don't know what 'awesome' healthcare you think you can get for almost nothing, but here all of the cheap healthcare sucks and in many cases is still too much cost wise if you are in a lower income bracket. Also, the prices of things obviously vary from place to place. What may be cheap to you in Dallas is way too expensive for me in Chicago. Same with being able to carry guns; it's not the same everywhere. 

And really? IHOP and Walmart are some of the first things you think about when listing why capitalism is great? Those are considered 'white-trash' by many people and Walmart is known to treat their employees like shit and cut their hours so they can't work full time or get benefits. Well, that or only higher seasonal employees and fire them/make them quit after 3 months."
aqouta,leagueoflegends,1389986872.0,why that makes perfect sense. silver 5 is already where the reset would take him and then he lost more of the hugely swinging placement matches than he won so he ended up lower. this is especially true if he was stuck near the bottom of silver 5 and just not able to drop due to not dropping division.

Mario in particular covers tons of different genres and even the main series platforming games like 64 and Galaxy are incredibly different.

Stop paying attention to the name on the cover and look at the gameplay, which is the point of the entire medium of video games. A lot of the IPs you think are unique are just derivative of genres that are popular, having a different look but very similar gameplay. It would be nice for Nintendo to get a new IP, but only if it covered a style of gameplay that is not covered by any of their other genres, and that would be very hard to do indeed since they have almost all genres covered except FPS and open world, pretty much."

I'm blaming her for what she's *actually* at fault for, which is not returning to the scene of the accident and trying to hide the evidence.  

&gt;though she should probably have reckless driving

The thing is, if there were any grounds to be charged with reckless driving, she would have been.  The fact that they didn't probably indicates that she wasn't actually at fault for the accident itself, likely because the leaves extended well into the street, or because there was oncoming traffic making her unable to swerve.   

&gt;there's no reason to be driving through a leaf pile fast enough to kill two children on impact (meaning, she was going pretty damn fast

It doesn't matter how slow or fast you're going, if the kids are lying in a pile of leaves and you drive over them, they're going to die.  She could have been going 10 MPH and they still would have died. That's what happens when a 1-ton hunk of steel rolls over your vital organs.  "

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389987306.0,"I had Prime Instant Video for about 6 months and I've had (or used a friend's) Netflix since it first came out. 

From my personal experience, I prefer Netflix. It's easier to find stuff I want to watch and it provides genres or suggestions right at the start. As others have stated, it's very ""streamlined"". It's interface is remarkably easy to work with. It also let's me have separate profiles, which is amazing. I can watch my shows and my SO can watch his cooking shows. I also like that I have access to it on every device: Kindle, Laptop, Desktop, Smart 3D TV, SO's iPad &amp; iPhone, my Surface &amp; S4, ect. 

As for Prime Instant Video, it's not very easy to get to. I think during the first month it was extremely complicated to use. I couldn't figure out how to even get to the video section from the Amazon website. I had to Google how to do it (and I'm pretty computer literate). As for connecting it to my TV, that was even more complicated. I had to be on the computer and enter a code to sync it to the TV and it would always kick us off when we were watching. I also think that the user interface was not very good. I don't like that they had both paid and ""free"" stuff to watch all together. I would get excited about seeing something I wanted to watch, only to realize I had to pay extra. That really annoyed me. As for selection, I think that Netflix has more options at least toward what I want to watch or what I find interesting. Comparatively, I had easy access to Prime on my Kindle, but as I stated before there was major issues with it connecting to my TV. I don't even think there is an app for it on the Windows Store (they only have Amazon.com app). I've only had a few issues with Netflix and that's more my SO's trying to stream Twitch, while I'm trying to watch my shows.

Any who, this is just my experience and my preference! :)

2: I never actually went ring shopping. She told me what kind of ring she wanted so I was going to get it for her birthday. The ring is a Tiffany and Co Square Ste Cut, Platinum ring because she hates round diamonds and yellow gold.  

3: I called him about 30 minutes after the meeting. ""Heartfelt"" is a little strong. He answered because I called their house phone. I don't know if my number shows up on caller ID or not. We had an extremely awkward conversation and he DID start crying.  

4: I was in the living room, it was 6 or 6:30 AM so the kids were in bed. Brittany, the girl, was in the kitchen or upstairs or some shit. He used his key, walked in and that's when we met. She, at first, tried to convince him I was her cousin but I said, ""Wait... What?""  

5: She does not live on base. Had she lived on base, I would have been very suspicious.  

6: She had hidden or thrown away all his stuff because I didn't see any of it for 5 months.  

7: Her kids did mention ""Daddy"" but they are both very young. They don't know where Daddy is and Brittany never volunteered any info.

Also, are you on any other meds? Do you smoke or drink coffee? Any kind of stimulant can make obtaining an erection more difficult. As can alcohol.

Finally, you could try other anxiety-reduction techniques such as progressive relaxation, self-hypnosis, massage, physical exercise, yoga, mindfulness, meditation, etc. There is also one sort of unique mental technique I witnessed once that can work very well. Instead of trying to push the anxiety away or suppress the thoughts, you do the opposite. You fully embrace the anxiety, and flood your brain with all the fears and what ifs and worst-case scenarios. You actually *try* intentionally to increase your anxiety level in the moment, and keep it high. After a while, the anxiety should subside on its own, because your mind almost gets tired of trying to sustain that high anxiety level for a long time. It's almost like you just throw yourself into the feeling until you get desensitized to it.

Intimate relationships don't just fade away for some people.  When I see my exes - any of them, regardless of how inadvisable it'd be to actually get back together with them - I get excited and emotional and happy and talkative.  That's because I feel comfortable around them in a way I don't around non-exes.  And usually I haven't seen them for awhile, so there's a lot to say!

The easy intimacy is familiar with exes.  It doesn't mean I want - or your boyfriend necessarily wants - to get back with them.

You should certainly talk to him about the way it made you feel, and he should listen and adjust his actions to avoid hurting you as much as possible - but you don't need to take this on its face as evidence of anything bad."

I've had a CB-3000 and CB-6000/s, as well as a custom device (Queen's Keep) from Mature Metal. 

The CB-X000 devices are a good starting point, you can get an idea of what ring size and spacing will work for you. I found the 3000's hinged ring caused me a lot of pain (though I understand they have updated the ring to be more like the 6000 in more recently manufactured devices). The 6000 was very comfortable for me but the plastic rings broke and the cage also split, I couldn't rely on them. 

My experience with the Mature Metal device is ok, except that I need something around my waist to help hold it on, moreso than the CB devices. This may be due to the different material (weight and friction characteristics) and also the design of the device, which has a narrower ring and places the penis tube a little differently relative to the ring. 

I'm also not sure if I have a reaction to the metal, or if something is still too tight, or if the metal does more chafing than plastic, but I do seem to have some problems that way too (I did have these problems with plastic as well, but not as quickly). 

Whenever I can afford it, I want to upgrade again to a full belt such as My-Steel or Neosteel. "

I suppose it wouldn't be so bad if you picked a place with wood-burning fireplaces and lots of trees, but that wouldn't guarantee you a long-term source of food.  Then again, maybe after most humans were dead, wildlife would probably see dramatic population increases, so I guess you could at least have a decent source of meat.

Yell_owish,AskReddit,1389987966.0,"Well from what I remember this was taught at the very beginning when I was young. Then the prononciation rules were for the most part left behind grammar and vocabulary. Not that these are not useful. I remember we used to have access to audio labs about 1 or 2 2h sessions per month. The lab was often unavailable and that session simply dropped. When you factor in the fact the teacher would take about half an hour to boot the computers/plug the vcr&amp;tvs and explain the lesson to us and we had to stop before the end of the lesson to clean everything up and stop the machines, we didn't have the feeling we were practicing a lot. It was mostly listening comprehension, not speaking training anyway.

I've heard or read somewhere (maybe on reddit ?) that scandinavian countries are doing way better than us because their american tv shows are not dubbed at all, so they have to listing to English/american stuff all the time.

Here, everything is dubbed, translated, frenchised. Only recently with the emergence of numeric television more and more channels are giving people the opportunity to show subtitles and listen to the original audio. I think it's great. When the same serie is on air over and over, I can switch to English and still be sure to understand everything because I know very well what's happening.

You're right, when you don't pratice often, you quickly loose your knowledge. Thanks to Internet, mainly, I can read in English daily but I'm barely given the opportunity to actually speak so it's hard to make progress.

onthefence928,QuotesPorn,1389988097.0,"from the wiki:

Poetry uses forms and conventions to suggest differential interpretation to words, or to evoke emotive responses. Devices such as assonance, alliteration, onomatopoeia and rhythm are sometimes used to achieve musical or incantatory effects. The use of ambiguity, symbolism, irony and other stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations. Similarly, metaphor, simile and metonymy[4] create a resonance between otherwise disparate images—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived. Kindred forms of resonance may exist, between individual verses, in their patterns of rhyme or rhythm.

basically, rhyming and set beat patterns are only features of some kinds of poetry, but all poetry plays with the sequence of words and phrases to add additional meaning to the poem beyond the meaning of the words, so if in this case, the poem actually does have a rhythm to it, even if its not rhyming, and the story he tells is heavy in metaphor and allusion, its intended to instill emotion beyond the literal meaning of the words.

That's not exactly how the conversation went - it was a bit more involved than that, but basically, in our relationship, we take criticisms of behaviour towards each other on board.

yourdungeonmaster,rpg,1389988217.0,"I'm speaking from the context of my group of players.  The style we use isn't for everyone.  The guys in my group enjoy solving intricate traps *as players*, laugh when the traps get sprung and bad things happen, or laugh when they beat the traps but consider how comical the consequences would have been had they failed.  

I try to limit myself to traps that make sense in the context in which they appear, and that are both easily bypassed and difficult to accidentally trigger by denizens in the know.  I don't tend to add secondary defenses just for the sake of making encounters harder, which I agree *would* be railroady.  That being said, my players have learned that in my settings, the more obvious the trap appears, the more likely it is that there's more to it than at first meets the eye.

I guess if I had a group of ""roll"" players for whom the kinds of concerns you mentioned would apply, I would be less inclined to use traps.  There's no right or wrong style, of course, but I'm sure glad I've got the players I do."

Maybe they get a bit carried away but a lot of fans do, and you have to remember that as far as pro-sports go, Seattle hasn't had a whole lot to be happy about since the mid-90's, when the Sonics got to the finals (and lost) and when the Mariners *almost* made it to the World Series.  

Since then, they lost the Sonics (who were loved), the M's have been horrible other than the record-setting season for wins in which they were shamefully bounced in the playoffs, and the Seahawks got robbed in a Super Bowl.  But hey, the Washington Stealth (based in Everett, kinda the equivalent of Golden or Ft. Collins) won a championship and so did the WNBA Storm!

userNameNotLongEnoug,dogecoin,1389988383.0,"I was thinking of something like this. It would be cool if the tip bot had an extra keyword which would send maybe 10% of a tip to reddit, the rest to the person you're actually tipping. For instance, I might do

&gt; +/u/dogetipbot 100 reddit-doge

A `reddit-doge` would mean that instead of the whole tip going to the person, reddit gets a certain percent. Of course you could also give the whole amount to the user with the basic `doge` keyword. All reddit would have to do is get a doge address and be willing to accept our money (this should be trivial for them). Of course the tip bot author would have to be willing to implement that as well. 

I envision this in addition to your idea, where we could just tip reddit directly. The badge would be awesome, but i'm not sure reddit would be willing to implement that immediately. I think if they can at least start accepting our doge its a huge success. 

At the end of the day gold is pretty useless if you're using RES. Doge tips are a much better way to show appreciation since you can scale the value however you like. If part of that could also go to reddit, this will help us get to the moon!

In places where the ordinary law abiding citizen has their gun ownership rights restricted, criminals are more brazen and bold because they reasonably expect that potential victims will not be armed. In places with less restrictive gun controls, criminals have to reasonably assume that their potential victims *will* be armed, and therefore they are less brazen with their violent actions.

getondachoppa,formula1,1389988425.0,"Kimi Raikkonen doubts the 2014 Formula 1 rule changes will make a very big difference for drivers.

F1 is undergoing one of its most dramatic technical overhauls this winter, headlined by a move to turbocharged V6 engines incorporating powerful energy recovery systems.

But Raikkonen doubts the driving experience will change much.

""My feeling is that it's not going to be as different as people think,"" he said in a video interview for Ferrari, which he has rejoined this season after a four-year absence.

""But I might be wrong.

""Hopefully we'll find out that it's pretty simple.

""For sure it is already difficult for all the technical people to make a new engine, new gearbox, all this stuff, but as a driver it's not affecting the driving so much.

""Obviously we'll have new buttons and new things to follow, but let's wait and see how easy it is.""

Raikkonen was also ambivalent about F1's controversial introduction of double points for the season finale from this year.

""It's the same for everybody,"" he said.

""For sure it might help somebody and might be against somebody else and the people who it helps will like it.

""For me it doesn't matter. It's the rule and like it or not, it isn't going to change."""

hubeijames,DotA2,1389988482.0,"What kind of pubs are you playing where you're able to just play the same role every time and it always works out? If you decided you want to be a carry or mid specialist, too bad, so has everyone else who plays Dota. To a lesser degree this applies to the other roles too, you'll sometimes have games where your team has too many offlaners, too much jungling or too many supports (believe it or not, it's possible). 

Good pub players are those who can identify what their team needs (no, it's not support every time) and play accordingly. The best pub players  are flexible in their ""role"" even well after heroes have been picked--no one's buying wards, or or the guy with the carry hero isn't getting any farm? Adjust your play accordingly.

To learn how to do this, pick a versatile hero and learn how to play them in different roles. Pick heroes like Naga Siren, Vengeful Spirit, Enchantress or Alchemist. Learn how to play carry, roaming ganker, ward-bitch support, utility-support on each of them. That is how you master the different roles: playing completely different games with the same hero.

For lower level players, this is not what you're talking about when you talk about roles. Instead, by ""role"" you mean ""stable of similar heroes."" Someone who only plays PA, PL, Wraith King, Luna and Lifestealer isn't a carry specialist; they are very limited player who has mastered only a tiny fraction of the game. Role becomes an excuse to pick only heroes that are similar to each other, to avoid going out of your comfort zone, to avoid growing as a player. Don't assign yourself a role. You're only hurting yourself as a Dota player."

raziphel,AskMen,1389988516.0,"&gt; My problem is how nonchalant a lot of Americans are about guns. They don't properly respect them.

You're not looking in the right places.

In the media?  You're absolutely correct.  In the average home?  Not so much.  Just because we may *appear* nonchalant at times does not mean we are careless.  Heck, I wish people were as careful with cars as they are with firearms!

Yes, there are armed fools out there, but understand that they are a minority of gun-owners.  ""Unalienable Rights"" means you cannot have intelligence tests for these things; not for guns, not for speech, not for voting, because how do you really judge someone's ability to be a safe and responsible citizen?  ""Innocent Until Proven Guilty"" means we cannot take away people's rights because they *might* be dangerous or because we don't like them; we have to wait for them to prove themselves incompetent or dangerous somehow first (proven mental instability, criminal past, etc).  

Weapons that are proven statistically dangerous (mostly handguns) do require background checks and other ""hoops"" to prove safety and competency.  Concealed-Carry Laws are even more difficult, but they are not impossible.  Sure those laws are not as strict as Norway's, but for the most part, we feel it's a good compromise (which is the best you're going to get in a diverse, dynamic society)."

fridge_logic,Economics,1389988602.0,"&gt;The central bank clearing the market can certainly have the effect of lowering the rate. It does not however follow that it produces inflation. Severe or otherwise.

I don't understand how you can make this claim. When a central bank buys government bonds with money from accounts it creates it is increasing the monetary base and thus contributing to inflation. Money multiplier effects can increase this contribution depending on the lending behavior of banks.

In fact the American Federal reserve buys government bonds specifically to cause inflation and stimulate the economy. [Well respected financial experts are justifiably concerned by the inflationary potential of excess central bank stimulation.](http://www.businessinsider.com/arthur-laffer-interview-2014-1)


&gt; They're never ""stuck"" with the bonds, even in ordinary times central bank provide a reflux channel to absorb bonds back through dealers.

I don't mean to imply that they are stuck, merely that purchase of bonds is an investment choice which redirects the flow of money instead of creating it. I make this statement to contrast it with the idea of the central bank buying the bonds. "

(Given the emotionally traumatic nature of the issue for some, it could also be considered harassment done with the intent of inflicting psychological harm, but that's another matter.)

A religious symbol, meanwhile, does not carry the same clarity of intent (a religious symbol could mean many different things to many different people), and therefore does not constitute *reasonable grounds for concern* about the impartiality of services.  The government and the courts can not explicitly define religious symbols as having specific meanings unless those meanings are expressed in a clear, concise, unmistakable manner."

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389988802.0,"Well... I'll be graduating from college in May with a BA in History... I guess that should answer this question :)

But when I was younger, I enjoyed my Art classes. I loved working on little projects. Maybe that's why I enjoy sewing and having an art journal. I really enjoyed taking this Art course in college during my Freshman year. I wanted to take another one this last semester just for fun and to fill some last credits I need, but the remaining classes are only for Art majors and it was very dissatisfying for me. So, I'm taking a Music class instead. 

I know this is going to sound terrible, but I also really enjoyed Math when I was younger. There was something about math problems, algebra, geometry, and calculus that I just *got*. When I was in Elementary school, I used to ask my mom to write down math problems when I didn't have school so I would have something to do. 

Another subject I *really* enjoyed was Biology. Something about plant and animal cells that just spoke to me. And genetics, I love genetics... :)

Ahhh. I know the question was what was your favorite... But, it's always so hard to choose. I guess my all time favorite subject would have to be History. There are many, many reasons why I love History. And when I say History, I clump in my major and minors (Archaeology and Ancient Civilizations) together. Learning about who we are and why we are the way that we are (historically, of course!) is something that I find absolutely fascinating. It just amazes me the human achievements that our species has accomplished... The building of the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Colosseum... The process of how we've grown and developed as humans from the beginnings of evolution to the first cities and writing. It all just amazes me. It's a huge story and I want it to keep going and going... I must know what happens next! :)

Anyways... I rant on! If you've made it this far, we should be friends... :)"

**Ingredients**

* One pork shoulder (7-10lbs)
* A few cups of apple cider vinegar
* salt, pepper, and some seasoning mix (I use basil and garlic mix)

**Procedure**

Place the pork shoulder in the crock pot, fat side up. Add the seasoning to the top of the pork (be very generous). Pour in apple cider vinegar until roughly 1/4 - 1/3 of the pork is covered. Make sure to pour directly onto the top of the pork shoulder; this allows some of the seasoning to wash down into the vinegar.

Cook on low for 7-9 hours. When it's done, use a pair of forks (or tongs) to transfer the shoulder to a large dish with a lip. Use the forks to shred the cooked pork.

You can mix up a vinegar/mustard barbecue sauce and pour it on the finished product."

It didn't work the last 20 times you did it, it's not going to work now.

Entirely possible! Classes may not work too well, just by virtue of not every child responding the same way to the same methods. Intimidating them does no one any good, though.

Serae,rpg,1389988985.0,"You are looking for a reason to state that the OP is being sexist.  You are reaching, hard.  The OP is in no way saying men and women aren't equal.  They are just excited to have a largely female based group. 

We're talking playing population, not social equality. I have been playing table top for 13 years.  I'm female.  I did not play with another female player until 4 years ago.  That means it took 9 years for me to cross paths with another female player and 9 years of not being able to pique the interest of other females although I actively tried.

Right now females are really coming into their own with table top gaming.  We have had a female venture captain for PFS in my area.  I have regularly had another female (or two!) at both PFS, lengthy campaign or just board game night.  For many people it is still rare to see females at the game table.  I grew up in a town with 2,000 people and now I live next to a metropolis with 620,000.  There are game shops.  There are gamers.  There are public places to game and not just small circles of friends in your dining room or kitchen.  The hobby is available to more people here.  That may not be so for the OP.

It is NOT sexism to state what the population of a playing community is.  Let's look at, say, a flower arranging class.  You have 20 people in that class and 16 are female.  It is not sexist to state that there are more females than males in that class.  It would be sexist to state that men are not allowed to go to the class; are not capable of doing proper arrangements; or that they would be uninterested in a class like that.

Less women play table top.  More women are playing table top then ever before.  It is not sexist to make an observation on either of these things.  It would be sexist to state that women have no interest, are not welcome, or are not valuable to a playing experience.  

OP is not sexist for being excited about a change in their own personal player demographics.  They were just sharing their surprise and excitement about what is to come for them.

ctesibius,motorcycles,1389989220.0,"You're hearing one side of the story here, because that's what was asked for. Another side is that I would be twenty years dead by now if I'd been driving a car on one trip, and I'd probably have had a serious accident about a month back. On the bike, I just carried on.

The first was coming over the Pennines in winter. That's a ridge of hills that form the backbone of England. There was fog: perhaps 100 yards visibility. Two cars came in the other direction, moving fast. One was overtaking the other in my lane. There was no time to brake, and I doubt that the driver reached his brake pedal - cars have such a dangerously unergonomic set of controls. I moved left by a few feet, and went through the narrow gap between him and the kerb. In a car, I would't have survived the collision, and I couldn't turn it fast enough to get it off the road for a safer crash.

The second was just a case of running in to a 12-15"" deep flood at night at 40mph on a twisty road. My fault - I didn't see it in time to recognise that it wasn't just a puddle. The rounded tyres of my bike cut through the water to the road. It was a nasty moment, but I stayed upright. A car would have hydroplaned, lost all grip, and probably hit the side of the road hard.

Probably best to stay out of those deathtraps and get a nice safe bike!

Also those of us without dramatic stories are probably not commenting. Personally I've done about 300,000 miles without major incident.

The other part of the trick is that the CPU continues to hoard more and more of the system that used to be part of the motherboard onto itself. Uncore is a massive part of the chip now.

The real advantage Intel have had since AMD spun off their fabs and going forward is that they have superior silicon fabrication tech and the money to keep developing it.
Wrapping all that together there is real benefit to having control of the entire development process.

AMD used to or still might have some leverage in datacenter space where the performance metric is based on performance/watt. However at this point the new Xeons are just packing more cores every generation and virtualization being the name of the game that is a welcome sight. At least in the industrial services sector, I dont see any AMD stuff being used. At this point It is more likely to be a tug of war between Intel and ARM than Intel and AMD there.

Erisari,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389989564.0,"Hmmm... Depends on where you are. I know Walmart has a $45 unlimited everything plan. Even a $35 one, not all unlimited of course. You might have to talk to a service rep about switching your phone over.

Verizon has iPhones. My SO has the 5s or whatever. I have the S4 (I'm not an Apple fan :P). But, we both have Verizon. They have pre-paid plans (Virgin Mobile, I think?). I'm not sure the costs, but look it up. I know they take phones from other providers (at least they used to) because my dad switched his phone over a while ago.

Another option is T-Mobile. I *think* T-Mobile and Sprint (which I saw you said you have now) are on the same kind of network. 

If the phone company you want to go to is on the same network as Sprint, they will definitely take your phone. It's like phones that used to take SIM cards (do they still have those? I'm not sure) and you could switch companies by just replacing the SIM card. For example, Cricket &amp; Cincinnati Bell (I live in Cincinnati) both use SIM cards, or they used to when I was with them, and I could switch between those two companies easily. I know when I had T-Mobile, they told me that (T-Mobile used SIM cards back then) I could go to Cincinnati Bell if I wanted too. 

Anyways, unless some else comments and knows their stuff, I think your best option would be to just shop around, find the deal you like, then go in and talk to someone to see if they can switch your phone. Or do that first? I don't know, which ever you like. I usually take a long while when I search for a provider, to see all the options. But, you may just want to find out if it's even possible (I think it is!). 

Any who, sorry for the long rant and good luck! :)

Theungry,AskMen,1389990023.0,"&gt;And you note that poisonings kill 2.5x as many people firearm homicides.

Undistinguished in the data is whether those poisons are controlled substances or not.

&gt;Yet blunt instruments are the #3 murder weapon of choice.....maybe shouldn't rule those out.

At 549 to 8,847, it's not really close.  That's a ration of 16 gun homicides per 1 blunt object homicide.

&gt;Great, lets increase my mandate then. Proof of insurance if you're going to by any poisonous chemical, pharmaceutical or otherwise. 

You have provided no data that indicates that over the counter chemicals are a significant risk factor.

&gt;""But what about people who obtain pills by illegal means?"" While, what about guns the same way?

That's a weird straw man.  I'm not making that argument.

&gt;You're confusing risk with insurance. Gun owners aren't less liable because they aren't insured. In fact they are more vulnerable. But that doesn't mean we should mandate insurance.

No I am providing insurance as an example of risk management.  You're confusing mandated insurance with socially acceptable risk.  With a car the reason insurance is mandated is because the car itself poses a significant risk to others, and owning a car does not put one in the position to pay for the consequences of that risk (unlike having property which could be sold to cover a lawsuit).

I am interested in a conversation about other options for for managing the risk of guns.  I like the insurance option because it puts most of the onus on the free market to establish prices and do 99% of the work, while giving law enforcement access to charges that only pertain to illegal guns.  I don't think it's the only option, but it's the one I've seen that I think is the most practical that doesn't really infringe on any rights while bringing some accountability to gun ownership that seems missing to me.

I understand, you and others don't feel the accountability is missing.  I would put forth that the system in place currently is not ideal for most people, and I am more interested in a conversation about what is best rather than who is right."

hubeijames,tall,1389990162.0,"Probably a bigger issue for tall girls than tall guys. I was taller than all my teachers starting in 7th grade (including the men), but for guys it's not just height that marks adults, you also have body filling out, the voice dropping down, and the face bearding up. I was an early bloomer for height, but the other stuff took until I was 16 to 18 just like all of the other guys. I don't think I was ever mistaken for older than I was.

I did know one guy who really looked like an adult by the end of 8th grade, complete with a burly musculature and very dark, full facial hair, but I expect even among the tall men here such things are rare."

raziphel,AskMen,1389990166.0,"In the US, hunting actually plays a vital role in protecting the deer population.  They have no natural predators, so if hunting does not control the population, they will over-populate and starve (in a repeating, messy cycle).  It's actually a serious issue, and well-regulated hunting addresses it nicely.

Wild Pigs are a much greater issue, especially in the South, because they're very destructive and dangerous to property and people (similarly, have no natural predators).  It's always open season for them.  

Too bad there's no Canada Goose season..."
rising_son,Guitar,1389990168.0,"If the guitar is brand new it should definitely not have an overly high action. If it IS new, then it is likely in need of some setting up or if it has been set up then something is wrong with the bow of the neck or some other problem, perhaps the action has been raised to prevent fret buzz as an easier alternative than dressing the frets. 

If you can go and actually check the guitar out in person, hold down the first fret with a finger on your left hand, while holding down the string to the last fret with a finger on your right hand, and look at the 10th-12th frets and how much space there is between the bottom of the string and the top of the frets. 

If there is very little room it is likely that the action has been raised at the bridge to relieve fret buzz, or that the guitar has just been carelessly set up. If there is a lot of room between where I mentioned before then the neck is bowed substantially and you should probably avoid buying it unless the store is willing to do a free set up for you. 

I would absolutely on no circumstances buy a guitar with a bowed neck or dodgy frets. It could be one of these reasons, hard to say without actually seeing/feeling the guitar myself.

Edit: I didn't answer your last question. If the guitar has had it's neck relief changed or saddles raised to relieve fret buzz, it is likely that buy lowering the saddles will gradually introduce the same buzz back again. Again I can only speculate as I haven't held the guitar in my hands."

SenseiCAY,dominion,1389990174.0,"Yes. If you played enough of them (especially with King's Court or Throne Room), you could replace someone's province (or any card) with a curse, if you could bring a card's cost down to $0. 

Furthermore, cards like Bridge and Highway (+1 card, +1 action, all cards become $1 cheaper) will affect some ""trash-for-benefit"" cards, like Apprentice (+1 action, trash a card, +1 card per $1 that the trashed card cost, +2 cards if it costs a potion) or Bishop (+$1, +1VP, trash a card, +VP equal to half of the cost of the trashed card rounded down). In the case of Apprentice, you'd get one less card (for example, if you trashed a silver, you'd normally get +1 action, +3 cards with Apprentice (since silver costs $3), but if you managed to play a Bridge or Highway before the Apprentice, the cost of silver is now only $2 and you'd only get 2 cards. Similarly, bringing down the cost of cards will also cause Bishop to earn fewer points."

screenmagnet,sex,1389990219.0,"Do you mean you need to use lube for penetration? Or for clitoral stimulation?

Have you noticed a decrease in vaginal lubrication? Change in sex drive, energy levels, or sleep? Change in vaginal discharge, urinary habits/continence, colour or texture of vaginal mucosa or vulval skin? Any itching or burning or other discomfort of the vagina or vulva? Has your weight changed at all? Less exercise than before? Any change in meds (including OTC stuff, topical creams, nasal sprays, herbal, vitamins or supplements)? Change in smoking or caffeine habits? Change in diet or fluid intake? When was the last time you had your hormone levels checked? You say you are on HRT. Is that just estrogen, or are you on testosterone replacement as well? Any change in the brand or dosage or administration schedule of your HRT? Sometimes the tiniest changes in HRT can have massive effects.

Regarding the suction device...I have done pussy pumping a few times, and I definitely notice a big decrease in sensitivity in my clit right after I pump. But it goes back to normal by the next day. Did you pump to the point of pain? Was there any bruising, burst capillaries, or other signs of damage?

You could try abstaining from orgasm for a bit and see if that makes achieving orgasm earlier. Or you can ditch the vibe and try light, constant stimulation using your finger to move the hood in circles over the clit (it will take longer, but may retrain you to cum from light touch). Also, try to maximize blood flow to the region before getting started. You can do this through physical exercise and heat (hot water bottle, hot tub, sauna). You can try combining clit stimulation with g spot stimulation, nipple stimulation, or anal stimulation (just wearing a thong that rubs against your anal opening can do wonders). One last trick I use to improve clit sensitivity -- use your finger to stroke firmly up and down about 1 cm *above* your clit. At first, this won't feel like much, but after a several minutes of this, you should notice the area above your clit start to stiffen and protrude, as the internal portion of the clit engorges with blood. This will make the external portion more erect and engorged. Then you can start directly touching your clit. This should make achieving clitoral orgasm easier (and make the orgasm stronger). Rubbing on either side of the clit or around the clit works similarly, but IME, rubbing 1 cm above the hood works the best. You can also use your vibe over your underwear to increase blood flow to the area before you get started with direct clit play.

Finally, make sure you stay well hydrated! This will help both with the lubrication and also with blood flow and arousal (dehydration leads to low intravascular volume which leads to low arterial blood pressure and less blood flow redirected to your genitals for arousal)."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389990221.0,"In high school I felt self-conscious about my looks. I wasn't bullied or anything but I just didn't feel pretty and I felt a pressure to be prettier. I often felt undervalued by my peers for not being sexy enough, and I envied the girls who got attention for their looks.

Fast forward to me at 22 - I feel much more attractive secure about my looks, but I am so grateful that I was a late bloomer. It gave me some critical years to really understand who I was independent of how everyone treated me. I no longer envy those girls I knew who were getting attention for their looks, because now I understand all of the prejudices people throw at you along with their compliments. 

Your teenage years are about figuring out who you are, and I think it would have been really hard to develop my inner identity if I was constantly getting feedback on my outer identity. The problem is not just that people make a big deal of your looks, it's that the comments and the treatment you get insinuate this or that about your character. 

When I was in high school I may have felt undervalued with respect to looks, but I was given a lot of credit for other things - for being smart, for being a good friend, being involved with activities. I never questioned whether the attention and praise I received for those things was genuine. So even though I wasn't confident about my looks, I was confident about everything else. When you are really pretty, it's the opposite effect. You looks are overvalued but it comes at the expense of being undervalued for everything else you bring to the table. On top of that, you can never be sure if the attention you're getting for your looks is well-intentioned. A lot of times it is meant more as an underhanded attack, or as a way to use you. The digs that people make at you can be subtle or indirect. A lot of times people are not even aware of the negative assumptions they are making about you. 

So on top of being insulted directly, you also have to deal with gaslighting, with second-guessing all of your relationships and what people really meant by doing this or saying that, and then second-guessing whether you are right to second-guess them or whether you are being paranoid. And you're often the only one who can stand up for yourself, because you're the only one who sees the problem--everyone else thinks it must be all roses. "

KRNMERCILESS,Fitness,1389990222.0,"The hamstring acts more as a hip extensor than a knee flexor. If the glutes (the bigg'un hip extensor) don't fire, those hamstrings have to make up for it and hang on to the hips for dear life. They aren't made to be the primary mover in hip extension, thus the feeling of ""tightness."" during the standing pike stretch. Its not that they are inflexible, its that they are actually *drawn short* due to always having to be on.

Our abs act as weak proprioceptors for our hips, if we lose abdominal stiffness we lose the ability for our hips to orient themselves in space (= lack of mobility). I'm not sure what McGill defines a plank as, but an RKC plank, as shown in Dean's article, are substantially more difficult than a traditional arched-back plank and have instant fixes to issues of external rotation and internal rotation (front and side planks, respectively) of the femur at the hip joint.

Sit yourself in the mirror and give yourself a big breath in and out. Stop reading. Go do it now. Seriously. Don't read on. Go Do it now. You did it? Good. Keep reading now. If you took a massive shrug to get that breath in, chances are you have a dysfunctional diaphragm and are getting your breath from your ribs and shoulders. This breaks the kinetic chain of our abs (diaphragm connects to ribs -&gt; Quadratus lumborum -&gt; glutes -&gt; pelvic floor -&gt; Transverse Abdominis -&gt; Rectus Abdominis -&gt; Ribs -&gt; Diaphragm...) effectively creating an unstable trunk. The diaphragm should be in line with the pelvic floor at all times (read: Starrett's 2 hand rule). A lot of the time I'll line people up in this way and they say they feel like they are slouching... Yes, because we live in a dominant ""chest-up"" society, which causes us to disassociate our ribs to our pelvis without actually fixing issues at the shoulders, put these ribs back in alignment with the ribs... And voila, all of a sudden we see the cause of shoulder pain.

I like the third world squat for improving hip mobility. [Squat (squeeze your abs as hard as you can), pull yourself down as low as you can push your knees out with your elbows](http://www.t-nation.com/img/photos/07-210-training/image006.jpg) and sit there.

It was an experiment to see what would happen, and experience jail. He passed by a bunch of officers on the way there, and literally had to turn himself in the next day once the vandalism made the local news.
  
Now, whether you think this is a stupid experiment or not, it proves that officers will take a second thought to confronting someone they feel has a chance to fight back. Not physically, but finically. This is the reason why college kids can get away with smoking pot while kids in the ghetto get hard sentences. College kids might have rich parents that will raise hell. Ghetto kids probably have poor parents who can't fight back.
  
I'm really proud of sites like Reddit, where you can see imagery like this and discuss it. It's very important to do this because it gets us all angry and sad, but it also makes us aware of what's going on. So that ALL of us can fight back and call this shit out.

Don't be a douche. Don't be an asshole to your teacher. Don't tell your teacher it's not ""fair"" that you have to read online lectures after you signed up for an online class. Don't email your teacher pretending to not understand material you didn't read so that they will be forced into summarizing it for you, and especially don't say you want ""2-3 sentences tops"" if they do send you a paragraph summarizing what you asked.

If you have learning disabilities do NOT let those records be sealed when you graduate. Take that paperwork with you and get appropriate accommodation. Most of us will know anyway and will feel like an ass when we aren't allowed to help you, but we literally AREN'T ALLOWED TO HELP YOU unless you have paperwork. 

Go to the tutoring center, especially the writing center, even if you already have good grades. No--really. The tutors will be thrilled to work with a high performing student and you will meet a community of people who all want to improve themselves. It's a good place. If it's NOT a good place (all tutors and teachers occasionally get really fed up and say horrible things about students, but if the writing center refuses to help ELL students learn the language because it ""colonizes"" them or the tutors call you stupid to your face) get the heck out and get study groups. 

Don't e-mail to ask the professor questions (or ask in class) if the answers are clearly spelled out in the syllabus, book, assignment sheets, Blackboard, or other course materials. 1. We don't have due dates memorized. I teach 4 classes and like hell I know when every last assignment is due. 2. It annoys me that you want ME to look it up for you instead of looking it up yourself. 

Don't let your new friends get in the way of your education. There is a lot of drama in college, though not quite the same as it was in high school, and I have seen a LOT of students drop out because of horrible fights with their friends (indirectly--usually trying to deal with them causes grades to drop). Others have left campus to go home because their new friends or significant others did something awful. Stay away from people who will make you feel that bad. Please. (The worst I ever heard was a guy who cheated on his girlfriend with another member of the religious org they were in. Rather than breaking up with him, she confronted him and then he and most of their friends sort of ganged up on her and told her that it was her own fault because she couldn't ""read"" him well enough and wasn't open enough to whatever deity. They wanted to sign her up with ""lessons"" about her boyfriend with the chick he slept with. She stormed off and kissed some other dude. Her boyfriend went nuts, and then the student org told her to make up for it that she ahd to have those lessons, and her boyfriend made her sleep on the floor for a term and refused to let her be anywhere any other guy was, including her classes. Consequently she dropped out, gained a lot of weight, and thought she was a lesbian for awhile. She never told anyone in admin so nothing ever happened to these assholes--and it wasn't all that unusual anyway. But lots of lesser things hurt students every day--don't let it be you!)

Turn things in on time.

Know how to do MOST basic computer tasks before getting to school including opening files, saving files, how file systems work (folders and stuff), zip files, attach files to email, use dropbox, upload files, and so on. Know how to use Word. Don't press enter at the ends of lines to double space things. 

And lastly, if you have never had to cite your sources before, set aside some time to learn how to do so before getting to college. Your English teacher will teach you a bit during freshman composition, but you need to be used to doing it already whether your high school taught you or not. Learn how to put in citations AS you write. It will slow you down at first, but after awhile it won't (I promise!) Use proper citations all the time, even when they aren't asked for. Some of your teachers will slap an A on anything properly cited--take the free good grades."

Scrub your lips with that mixture. It might hurt, but it'll be okay. Just scrub and try and get all of the dead flacky icky skin off of your lips. This is a really gentle and natural way to remove the yuck, and it's cheap and most people have these products at home.

Next, grab some vaseline and coat your lips with a thin sheen. Because you've already scrubbed off the dead skin, you should have a nice layer of alive and nonravaged skin to soak up the moisture. Leave it on and let it soak in.

That should stop the cracks from getting better, and if you do it every morning or night, it will absolutely fix your lips.

* Play in hardcore (""Nemesis"") mode, the danger will force you to learn much faster and make the game much more fun.

* Diablo 3 has no skill tree or builds, all characters of a class have the same skills and build and can switch anytime. In POE, each character's build and skills are unique and involve sacrificing one thing for another thing. If you want a character to be good at a different skill, you must create a new character.

And that's the problem.  In any group of people, there are bad apples, that is a given.  The real problem with police is the institutionalized culture of ""We are above the law"".

Good cops are afraid to do anything when they see a badge doing something wrong.  Here you are implying that you would feel bad, but let a cop do something horrible.  Until the police culture in the US does a complete 180, I cannot trust or respect any police officer, and will insist on recording any interactions I have with them.  "

Theungry,AskMen,1389990602.0,"&gt;It is an inalienable right, as outlined in our constitution. The entire point of the rights is that they do not expire or become obsolete

This is the specific language i was referring to.  There is a process to repeal amendments when society feels they have become obsolete.

Edit - Also, Inalienable means - unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor.  Again there is a process by which that right can be taken away.  Consitutional rights are not inalienable.  You may have confused the bill of rights with the Declaration of Independance:

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness

 We are in the bedroom against the wall next to the door, her top is open and  pants are undone and around her knees I am kissing her squeezing her breast and trying to close the door with my foot. I slide my hand down the front of her panties to feel her up and planned to then slide them down.
my finger just grazed her cliturous  ever so slightly and she has an orgasm so strong that goes in to fully body convulsions with eyes rolled back and slides down on to the floor in to the fetal position. I am not too sure what just happened since this is the first time of having sex with her    
 and every other girl's orgasm I had seen up till then  has been in bed during sex , and she arched her back and an Ohh or gasp, no a great big floppy arm flailing dance. She half sleepily says 'I came ' and so lift her on the bed waited  in hopes she would recover and want to have sex , she never did.    

Same girl, we were having sex in the day time I have been using the foot board of the bed  and she hears a noise in the other room. So tells me to stop it's her room mate. so we are dead silent , just then part of the bed collapses , my girlfriend screams the other part collapsed she screams again, the bed is tilted and us and the matress slide off pulling off all the sheets , The room mate rushes in to see if she was Okay and gets an eyeful and our relationship is no longer a secret    "

5kywolf,WritingPrompts,1389990682.0,"Eighteen years I've waited for this moment. For my power to spring out. For the legacy my father has left. They say my father was a freak, but I regarded him a hero; even though I never met the man.

I've lived in this world for eighteen years now. Endured bullying for the past six. I hated it. Despised it. Loathed it. I can and will think of every word of hate and negativity to these bullies. I had enough you pricks!

As usual, I walk towards my spot in the school when I spot the cluster of bullies.

""Hey freak, come on over here,"" Liam said.

I walk on over, afraid about what these bastards might do to me.

""I'm eighteen now! I can beat these guys now! But no, I'm skinny and small. These guys are massive! They go to the gym and are top rugby players,"" I argued with myself.

""I heard it was your birthday yesterday! Here's a cake for you."" Richard said.

I knew something was off. They were being nice. Liam and another one of the bullies, Niko, were smiling behind Richard as he pulls out a pie.

""Here!"" Richard exclaimed.

Richard thrusts the pie towards my face. My vision is darkening. I know what's going to happen. Not today, you bastards, not today. I let my body take the reigns of my mind. I let them work together seamlessly without me in the middle, trying to find compromise, which hinders what the human body is supposed to achieve. I ducked.

I swear I only punched Richard in the gut. Why is there blood running on my arms? What happened? I didn't bring deadly weapons to school! It's prohibited!

I slide my arms out of Richards corpse. His lifeless body dropped on the concrete like a rag doll. I can't take controls of my body! I don't know what to do.

Despite the fact that I'm arguing against myself. It actually felt good taking an enemy down.

Liam and Niko are still staring at me. I can see the fright in their eyes. I know that they want to jump at me but afraid that I'll kill them too. The entire school didn't dare to come near me. Instead, they were running towards the school buildings. I know the teachers already called the police.

As Liam and Niko started to run for dear life, my body acted against my will. I jumped at them. I don't know why I jumped or how I jumped 20 metres in one go. Liam and Niko dropped to the ground in a loud thud. Then, there it was again. The Tunnel Vision. I can't think straight. I can't see what my body is doing!

When I finally regained my sense of sight, Liam and Niko's bodies were unrecognisable. Liam's body looks like it was pounded by six-ton hammers. Niko's look like it's been caught in a shredder.

I hear the sirens wailing in the distance. The police are here. I run for the school gates but it was cordoned off by the cops. I have nowhere to go! For the first time in five minutes, my body let me use my sense of sight but I still can't control my body. My arms extended in a black flurry of tendrils towards the cop car, then swept the nearby officers off their feet. It's literal and maybe metaphorical, they may have fallen in love with this power that stayed dormant in me for eighteen years.

Then, a seemingly ordinary car pulled up about 15 metres from me. Followed by a riot van with 4 SWAT personnel in them. A man got out of the car holding a megaphone. Another one with what seems a medicine kit.

""Stay where you are!"" one man said.

""Why should I?"" I replied.

""I said get down Frank!"" 

""How do you know my name? Who are you?""

""It isn't time for questions now Frank""

""Like what you did to my father? Wiped his memories and used him like a guinea pig for your experiments?""

""Your stories are all wrong. Don't make us use brute force Frank""

""TELL ME!""

""Stand Down, Franklin Mercer!""

Before the unions the industrialization, machinery, and automation of that day brought child labor, workplace brutality, fatalities, terrible urban living environments, etc. Nine year olds aren't used as cheap substitutes to canaries in mines thanks to unionization, not automation, nor the benevolence of businesses, or even market change.

My husband and I want 2 or 3 kids, but we would prefer to have hopefully over a year (or more) between each of their births. Knowing that having a baby over 40 is significantly riskier for both mom and baby, we kind of set that as our upper limit.

1.) You are pushed up so sneaky lane ganks don't really happen unless the jungler is super mobile and they have some cc.  
2.) If their laners are low (which they should be) then they might not be able to respond in a gank, don't be afraid to 2v3 if they are harassed low and low mana from spamming skills to cs! Ever see junglers just run into a lane and 1v2 cause their allies are pushed into turret and cant respond? Yeah, that's winning the game, wasting their time and relieving pressure everywhere. Not to mention avoiding death. You might even get a cheeky kill on the jungler because they are more likely to overextend because hey, ganks bro. 2v3 is especially easy if they had to b and lost a wave of minions to the turret, level advantage! Also its not really 2v3 because you have more minions!  
3.) Since they wont be able to ward out deep your jungler will have an easier time counterganking.  
4.) You only need 2 wards when pushed up. One for tri and one in river. As opposed to those and a third/fourth in the side bushes. Also its pretty common sense to never be pushed up without those 2 wards. You should always see ganks coming. As an added bonus you are drawing their jungler bot which helps out your entire team!

My point was that you can accomplish precisely the same message in a positive fashion, without sinking to the other person's level.  You don't NEED to compare people, and you shouldn't humor other people when they do this shit - THAT'S how you change people's behaviors and beliefs.

Diabetics are difficult for two reasons:

1) The majority of type II diabetics I have worked with have been obese.  This makes finding a veing difficult (you may have to go through 2 inches of adipose tissue before you hit a vein).

2)  Diabetes is largely a disease of the vasculature.  This means that the veins you *can* get to are often poor; they may collapse, roll easily, and are narrow.  Poor circulation in diabetics is why amputations are so prevalent in the more advanced stages of the disease.  Toes and feet usually go first."

I love shooting them. I would say I'm a fairly good shooter. I've only been shooting for about a year and a half. I don't get to go shoot often at the moment, but I enjoy it and will hopefully go more often soon.

I love learning about them. I spend lots of time reading about guns - before it was books, and now it's a lot on the internet. I could tell you more about firearms and their recent (100 years) history than you probably want to know, but not enough to be considered an expert. Enough to pass /r/AskHistorians standards apparently, though.

I love teaching others about them. I'm a mechanical engineering student, and if you were to peruse my comment history, you'd find that I contributed one of the more technical posts in the /r/guns FAQ section. I try to help out with the mechanical and physics aspects on that subreddit when I can.

I love talking about them. /r/guns is probably the subreddit I visit and post/comment on most.

I love owning guns. I am a responsible gun owner. I own four so far. I bought them all in three weeks. It cost me about $800, and I bought one of them from a guy on the side of the road at a farmer's market when I was 19 (perfectly legal). I'm sure some people here think I should be on a watchlist because of that.

I love that my state allows me to carry a gun. I live in Texas. I can't carry in public, as I'm not old enough to have a concealed handgun license yet (21), so I carry in my car. I've been pulled over, and duly informed the officer as soon as he came to talk to me. He mentioned he wasn't sure about the legality, but I clarified the relevant statue politely. He was fine with my explanation. I did not yell anything obnoxious about my rights being trampled, police brutality, or whether I was being detained.e

I'm an engineering student, I love the technical aspect of firearms. I would love to work in the firearms or defense industry, but I'll have to see how things turn out.

For me, guns are a hobby and a means of self-defense and defense of others against crime. I will never understand why some people think hunting or sporting is a more valid reason to own a firearm than defending one's life. To me, that is *the* most important reason to do anything. I don't own them to defend myself from the government, but I certainly understand the reasons why many people do. If such a situation arose, I don't know what my response would be.

As an aside, for those who like to generalize American gun owners, I am not an American. I am a legal permanent resident of the USA, and a citizen of Sweden."

Dajbman22,AskMen,1389991045.0,"The key is knowing what you are talking about. 

Professors are often very intelligent and well versed in their subjects, but still human. Humans constantly make mistakes, especially when trying to verbalize concepts and information. When done respectfully and not in an interrupting manner, *most* academics actually welcome well thought out and genuine challenges to concepts as they are presented. Most people just went through college just to get through their classes and try to just absorb what the professors said. Others (myself included) prefer the more Socratic method of learning, and pushing for that interaction usually got me into a much better rapport with my professors and intrenched the departments of my two majors. It may be annoying for people who aren't into that learning style to watch this process unfold. They may even label people like me ""teacher's pet"", ""pretentious"", or any other myriad of names. In the end, though I was just getting the most out of my, frankly, very expensive university education, and the majority of people around me actually respected me more for it, both the professors and a decent number of my classmates around campus. It also helped that I tried my best to make sure my contributions were of the most help to as many students as possible, and to yield time to others whenever possible. 

In the end, though, yeah maybe I am a pretentious, arrogant douchebag to some degree, but at least I am learning something, and trying my damnedest to help others learn a thing or two in the process. "

&gt;Your argument was that firearms should have mandated insurance, as if they were some special type of killer.

No, my argument is that the risk to communities of gun ownership is disproportionate to to the liability of gun ownership in comparison to other comparable risks.  I think mandated insurance is a good way to realign the externality to the responsible party, but I am not married to it as the best solution.

Edit- Gun owners do face some legal ramifications if they fail to secure their firearms, but there is no requirement to transfer registration of a firearm for a secondary sale, and the consequences are all after the fact and inconsistent."

melonzipper,design_critiques,1389991203.0,"Overall, I think it's a pretty decent responsive site that needs a little bit of work:

* When you go smaller in the window size, and you're looking at a specific item, you lose all the text of the name of the item and it's price.

* When you're looking at a specific item, the text has a weird blue/purple/red dropshadow which makes it look unfocused and a bit like maybe it is on the same image as the item. Get rid of the dropshadow completely and keep it black text.

* On that note, the images themselves are a bit...fuzzy. They have an odd ""should I be viewing this with 3D glasses?"" feel to them.

* Your hamburger in the nav has a weird blue bg behind the lines, which makes it look wrong - keep it transparent or make them black to blend with the nav bg.

* Your nav says ""Sweaters"" but when you click, it then says ""Sweater"" I know you only have one sweater in your inventory at the moment, but keep it ""Sweaters"" for consistency.

* Also, hats has a cool picture bg, but sweaters have plain white as well as your homepage. Is this intentional? Keep it consistent choose either white bg for all, or pictured for all.

* What is the point for the heart next to the price on your homepage? I can't click on it to favorite...or do I have to log in? If I have to log in - I would make a navigational option for the log in screen instead of hiding it in the hamburger.

* I would nix the ""View Item"" link, as the entire section is click-able to the detail page. Maybe replace it with ""# shared"" or ratings of reviews like on your blog post.

* TBH - I see no point for the hamburger, as you only have the option for Store, Login/out, and Cart. Seems a bit of a wasted space considering how little is on the page - personally I see no issue adding those to the top nav. I understand you're trying to do a different take, but what's the point if there are only 2-3 items?

* Your cart is good, although, I would put a size restriction on how wide it can be, when you go to a widescreen monitor and stretch it out, it spans across the entire page which is a bit too wide. The ""total"" text is white on a light bg, which is a bit hard to read. Why not your accent red instead of white to make it stand out?

* Why do you want my Phone, Mobile Phone and Fax? I know it's not required, but rather odd to have for a clothing store.

* The blog is not centered, and has a white bg that's bigger than the content...coding issue? Also, the body text for the blog is a light grey on a dark grey - I really have to focus to read the text, change it to white and have your links be the same red accent. Maybe trying a lighter grey bg would help with the legibility of the red text.

* Can I ask why you chose ""blog"" instead of ""about""? I know you only have one post at the moment, but what do you plan to go there later on?

Again, I think it's pretty damn good for it's beginning stages, but some work and research on UX would help. I really like the fluidity of the sub-nav and side-nav action, very smooth. The color scheme is bland in order to make the items stand out, which is nice. Good work!"

They would be following the list as it is written today.  Nothing about printing gold-bordered or differently-backed cards goes against the List.

 At some point in the future, they would allow currently non-legal cards to be legal for tournament play.  *This is the same thing that happened with the Portal sets.*

&gt;Special-Purpose Reprints - Wizards of the Coast may print special versions of cards not meant for regular game play, such as oversized cards.

Honestly, though, I don't like the idea of a mid Disruptor because it doesn't particularly play to his strengths. A solo safelane Disruptor against a dual lane can do a lot better because Thunderstrike is so much more effective when you outlevel the people you're laning against. Not only that, but your opponents are more likely to be overconfident or careless, and you can catch them out of position more often."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389991310.0,"I think this is a really valid point. There are a lot of times when beauty can get you nicer treatment. But a lot of the attention you get can also be quite threatening, on top of being rude. 

Say hypothetically that you go out and for every person who treats you like you are something special because you're pretty, there's also someone who treats you like dirt. It doesn't really feel like it evens out. Now say that for every five people that treat you special for your looks, there's still someone who treats you like dirt. Objectively, it seems like your looks are benefiting you. But in reality, the person who treated you like dirt made you really feel like dirt, and the people who treated you nicely didn't make you feel like you were actually special to them. Most times you just feel like they want something from you. 

Being treated differently because of your looks, something more or less out of your control, can be really degrading regardless of which direction it goes.

I used to be absolutely horrible at being objective about my appearance, and while I've gotten much better (especially due to improving my self esteem), I still have some areas where I can't be objective about my looks.  Like if someone wears an outfit and asks me my opinion, I can *easily* tell them what works and what doesn't.  Right quick.  But if I look at myself in the mirror, I can't tell if I look okay in that particular outfit or not.  I need someone else's opinion.

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1389991428.0,"I agree with your first two statements.  You definitely can't just buy a place and rent it and make money.

On the other hand, I don't really agree with your last comment.  I haven't done any work myself, and use a property manager to handle renting, maintenance, etc. , and still manage real returns  (cash on cash) of &gt;25% after expenses (and &gt;12% RoE), plus ~25-50% initial returns in terms of equity capture (after accounting for cost of sale), depending on the deal.  I have had one really bad deal that I ended up sinking $15k more than expected into, but still didn't lose any money on it, and will probably end up with a reasonable (~10-12%) rate of return over 5 years if all goes well (it's all about margin of safety). 

That is all not counting on any appreciation (I don't like to speculate), though appreciation has made the actual returns closer to 40% for the last couple of years.  It's still a lot of work, but the returns make it worthwhile IMO.  I am hoping I can shave a couple of years off my current timeline if all goes well (I still use conservative projections of 7% return after inflation in my models)."

Dajbman22,AskMen,1389991432.0,"No. You're doing it backwards. You talk to men and women as friends/acquaintances first. Get to know people without the pretense of relationships or potential relationships first. You'll be more open and relaxed, and you have broken the ice with a wider swath of people and it shows to women that you are an outgoing and social person. Then once you get to know a person a little bit, it will be much easier to read if she will be receptive to a date or something along those lines. College is one of the few times/places when its much more likely for a relationship to organically grow from a friendship (due to proximity, copious free time, and lots of time spent together). It's not the only way couples meet up in college, and its not the only place a friendship can blossom into something more, but in many schools, it seems to be the most common situation. "

When I first started I twisted my knit stitches by always knitting into the back leg instead of the front. I was self taught from books and was only knitting flat things so it didn't really matter, but it was hard to get out of that habit when I started getting more advanced.  I really recommend that you start practicing knitting without twisting now, because as you advance it will be a lot easier for you once you start knitting patterns where the stitch twisting actually matters.

&gt; Especially in a country that is larger than Europe and not nearly as racially, economically, or socially homogenous as European countries.

That's still tremendously high for a modern society. I'm not sure how the heterogeneity of the US does justify a higher homicide rate. That's a genuine question. 

About the knife thing. You seem to be a measured person. At least admit your point don't stand. You can't possibly compare knives and guns. A child could kill someone with a gun. Not so many people would be able to harm you with a gun. I'm walking around in cities where I know everyone could hide a knife. I don't feel the need to wear one. If I was walking in a city where everyone may carry a gun, I might rethink that position. Especially if I were a robber or something. Guns call for more guns. 

I'll try to put myself in your place. The US already has a strong gun culture. I truly believe this calls for more violence. But if I were born in your country, knowing that it's not gonna change anytime soon, I might want a gun as well. It's a vicious circle, though. At the very least, I would like to ensure that not every crazy nutbag could buy a gun like if it were carrots in the market.

As for muslims in Europe. You're right, there's a lot of bigotry on our part. I'm also very annoyed by it. We also let a lot of second or third generation migrants rot in jobless ghettos. They're increasingly turning back towards a religion their fathers and grandfathers had given up. And in a more radical way. But muslims are also becoming more and more part of the european societies. Think of it like the civil right movement in the US in the 60s. Had we told you then that your president in 2008 will be black, how many american would have believed us? I guess not many. Doesn't mean the situation is now perfect for black people in your country, but it is improving, no matter how slowly. Well, we're in the 60s for Muslims in Europe. Still discriminated, starting to be accepted. Fighting for their right to be there. Sure there might be some outburst at some point. But enough to make our societies collapse and justify an armed civil war ? No way."

He can seem grumpy and when I finally get the answer of why out of him it's something totally unrelated to me but I can intuit that he isn't happy. And he hates it when I ask why he's grumpy! Gosh. 

And I really resonate with the idea of needing verbal affirmations, because that is certainly a necessity of mine. I would rather sit directly next to him than be on another sofa. And, similarly, when he needs alone time or space, my confidence can plummet! It can be an emotional roller coaster! 

Unfortunately, I haven't fully understood how to deal with these feelings other than being totally upfront and open about what I'm dealing with and what I'm thinking. We're great communicators, so this usually resolves it... until the next time! I haven't quite learned that part yet... :)

&gt; Tantôt l’œil du ciel brille trop ardemment, et tantôt son teint d’or se ternit. Tout ce qui est beau finit par déchoir du beau, dégradé, soit par accident, soit par le cours changeant de la nature.

&gt; Mais ton éternel été ne se flétrira pas et ne sera pas dépossédé de tes grâces. La mort ne se vantera pas de ce que tu erres sous son ombre, quand tu grandiras dans l’avenir en vers éternels.

&gt; Tant que les hommes respireront et que les yeux pourront voir, ceci vivra et te donnera la vie.

tashibum,changemyview,1389991811.0,"Here's how I see it.

 Offense is generally taken, not given...When offense is given, there is *intent* for it to be taken.

The difference of definition, in this case, will make it really hard to change your view, because our definitions of hate-speech are going to be different. (I'm assuming, here).

So my definition of hate-speech, or the difference between hate-speech and using a word some people might find derogatory, is intent. 

I rarely refer to things as gay, but when I do I use to portray both negative and positive lights, but in both cases, the definition has ZERO to do with homosexuals. In that sense, the word is not associated with homosexuals anymore.

The only time I use the word ""gay"" in any other sense, is in a case where I am ALREADY *specifically* talking about the LGBT community. That is the only other time I use the word.

Also, which phrase do you find more offensive:

""My computer is being so gay!"" or ""My computer is being such a homosexual!"" For me, the second is offensive, and I would never say that, because it explicitly refers to the LGBT community, *and* is used to describe something undesirable. So the difference here, is also thinking that the word ""gay"" explicitly refers to the LGBT community, but you can't deny that this isn't the case anymore. It *used* to, but most certainly not anymore. In the same sense that gay no longer explicitly refers to being happy. 

**Here's the best example of what I think is happening to the word:**
Take the word ""dumb"" for example. Did you know it was originally used to describe someone who was mute? It still is, but it's MUCH more commonly used to describe something undesirable (stupid). Now, here's the important part...How do you think it ended up being a word used for negative things, when it was originally used to describe a certain type of person? Sound familiar? This is exactly what is happening to the word. Dumb no longer explicitly refers to someone who can't speak UNLESS the subject is already on people who can't speak. For example:
""My computer is dumb."" and ""My neighbor is blind, deaf, and dumb."" The second sentence you obviously know you are not calling your neighbor stupid in the slightest. The first sentence, although I'm using the same word, does not mean my computer has the functions to speak and can't - it means my computer is being stupid. THIS DOES NOT MEAN that people who can't speak are stupid. At all. And you are pulling things out of your ass if you think using the word dumb to describe undesirable things is hate-speech towards people who can't talk. That association is long gone. 

This is what I think is happening to the word ""gay"" and I think it's a good thing. The more it's used to describe *things* in a negative light, and not *people* is a step in the right direction. 


So that's what I think. I'll be happy to clarify if I need to.

I know its harder outside of that context and situation, but I still have people in my social circle that came together in that way as well, long after we had graduated. It's not for everyone, and it requires more emotional investment early on, but it can and does happen frequently. 

It doesn't make you a spineless doormat to go in to something looking for friendship first (without even thinking about a relationship or anything romantic yet) and be open to it when/if something blooms. 

Honestly, the times it has worked for me, I wasn't really looking for anything actively. If it had gotten to the point of me actively looking for a girlfriend, I probably would have gone on the traditional casual-dating-first route, so I'm not against that method. I am just saying either method has a shot of working, and both requires a degree of risk. Sure with casual dating, the investment is lower to start, and the chances of at least going on a date in X amount of time are higher (due to a more active approach), but that doesn't ensure by any stronger of a factor that these relatively blind meetings will be with someone well matched for something serious (which is OP's end goal).

* The nature of the questions used, which varied across different countries. In Bangladesh **ONLY** questions related to **""forced sex""**. In all other countries rape is defined as **""coerced sex""**

              ""Have you had sexual intercourse with your partner
              when you knew she didn't want to, but believed
              she should agree because she was your wife/partner?""


* the one sample group which was asked explicitly about ""forced sex"" (Bangladesh) also had the lowest number of positive responses.



* The study covered a small number of Asian countries: Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Papua New Guinea. In each country, men were asked about their experiences both within and outside of relationships. In most cases, the samples were not nationally representative. In the case of Papua New Guinea, for instance, all of the respondents were based on the island of Bougainville.


* areas have a recent history of conflict, which might explain the appalling prevalence of sexual violence indicated by the study. Indeed if the two samples had not been included, the overall figure of men admitting to rape would have dropped to 18%.


TL; DR: The research is flawed.

Riot wants to give certain ranges of MMR certain labels.  and they want to have a certain % of people under each label.

What Riot is doing is just moving around the labels.  yes, everyone gets smushed together a bit, but your still playing against the same people...  

The people that will benefit from the reset are those that have a huge difference between their MMR and league rating.  the one guy that has diamond MMR even though he's still in bronze? guess what, he's not going to be in bronze anymore.  the guy that lucked into getting 10 wins in his promotion series even thoiugh he belongs in bronze? well guess what.  he might have been placed in gold, but since he lost all his games, his MMR puts him with bronze kids, so he's gunna be put in bronze after his 10 games.

Of course a picture I take myself on my phone in florescent lighting isn't going to look as good, as true to life, or as flawless as a picture taken with a professional quality camera and professional lighting. Even if no photoshopping is used. Also, who is going to be in charge of determining what effects are created by photoshop, lighting, or camera quality?"

Piepler or some high-ranking exec said something to that effect at one point (don't ask me for a source), saying that the money they would earn from a standalone HBO Go service is peanuts compared to what they earn from their deal with the cable ops currently. The assumption in that statement is that if they were to offer the standalone service the operators would terminate their current deal. If that's the case, HBO is a slave to the money they earn from cable, not the contracts they have with them."

Lion_on_the_floor,AskReddit,1389992775.0,"Just be there for her. When she cries or is said, acknowledge her grief, and even share some good memories of her dog.


I loved my dog more than anything in the world. I had to put her down almost two years ago. My boyfriend never loved a dog and can't relate to my affection toward her. He's also never dealt with a real loss before. When I mention her, or missing her, it would make me feel better if he acknowledged how difficult it is, without empathizing, but at least sympathizing. So my advice is just sympathize her grief if you can't empathize.


I'm really sorry :( 


EDIT: one thing that my boyfriend did that helped was the first time I saw him after it happened, we met for lunch. He gave me a present, it was a silver heart locket and inside was an etched photo he grabbed off my facebook of me and my dog. The other side had my dog's initials, which I thought was funny bc her name and my last name initial. I wear that necklace when I need good luck, or want to feel close to her because its discrete, you cant see unless the locket is open, or know it is a locket.

The thing is that most trans people, whether MtF or FtM don't go through SRS (sexual reassignment surgery). Many are due to financial or social reasons, however, it can come down to fear, whether it's of surgery in general or maybe the small chance that they may lose sensation down there and not be able to enjoy sex anymore.

screenmagnet,sex,1389993175.0,"Yep. This happened to me a couple years after I went on the pill. It was a gradual change. Then one day I woke up and realized that my sex drive had gone from high (wanting sex at least once per day) to practically non-existent (wanting it maybe once per month). I was still incredibly attracted to my boyfriend, and a sexual person in my mind. I was still constantly groping my boyfriend and grabbing at his penis at inappropriate times. I just never wanted to have sex or masturbate or have an orgasm. It was a very strange disconnect. I *wanted* to be horny, I *missed* being horny, but I couldn't *get* horny. So weird and difficult to describe. I just had no desire to have an orgasm. And worse, it actually felt uncomfortable to have my breasts or clitoris touched. You know how right after you have an orgasm, your dick is all sensitive, and you don't want anyone to touch it? That's how I felt...all the time. It really, really sucked.

I had to stop the hormones, and wait three years for my sex drive to come back. It was an agonizing wait. In the mean time, I kept my boyfriend sane by:

1. Having 'just-for-him' sex whenever he wanted. Just-for-him sex meant that he would just go straight to PIV and pump away until he came. I didn't want any foreplay -- I didn't even want him to touch my nipples or my clit or finger my vagina. I didn't want to try to get myself in the mood and I didn't want to try for an orgasm. I just wanted him to use my pussy to cum. I did enjoy the emotional closeness and watching him cum, but I felt like the most boring sex partner on the face of the Earth, and the physical sensation of him inside me ranged from mildly pleasant in a non-sexual way to mildly uncomfortable and irritating.

2. For that one time a month when I actually was in the mood (ovulation day), I would initiate aggressively and try to put all my energy and focus into the sex. I made sure to vocalize my enthusiasm and cum as hard and loudly as I could. This once-a-month wild sex sort of made up for all the lacklustre just-for-him sex we had the rest of the month, and kept his ego from completely destructing.

3. I continued to be very physically affectionate and handsy with my boyfriend, even though I didn't want sex. I would constantly come up behind him and slap his ass, grab his, cup his balls, etc. I always wanted cuddles. I would walk around nude and make him take his clothes off whenever he was around me. He did find this somewhat frustrating and confusing (since it was at odds with my sex drive), but ultimately it served to reassure him that I still desired him, and that mentally I *did* want to have sex with him, even though physically I didn't.

4. Kept lines of communication open. Explained to him exactly how and why I knew that this was purely a hormonal issue, and that there was nothing wrong with him or our relationship or my mental state. I told him all the time how upsetting my lack of sex drive was *to me*. And I kept him in the loop as I went on doctor's appointments, tried meds (I tried both testosterone pills and cialis), had blood tests done, etc. He saw that I was unhappy with the situation, that I was taking the problem seriously and taking appropriate steps to fix it in a timely manner. He saw that I was making it a priority. And that helped validate his feelings and reassure him that I prioritized his needs and that a healthy sex life was in fact as important to me as it was to him.

5. At a particularly low point (about 2.5 years after I lost my sex drive), I decided to boost his morale by surprising him with anal. He had wanted to try anal sex since we had first got together. He had never done it, and I had done it a few times with previous partners and found it painful and hated it. So I had told him early on in our relationship that I never wanted to try it again. He had been disappointed, but accepted it and moved on. So he was SHOCKED when on his birthday last year I told him I wanted him to fuck me in the ass that night. He was even more shocked that I was actually able to go through with it all the way to completion (we both thought we may have to stop at a finger). I did find it quite painful, and he could tell, and it meant so much to him that I wanted to give him the experience even though it was uncomfortable and painful for me. It was a sort of a turning point for us in our darkest times, and reaffirmed for him how much I loved him and that I was willing to put his needs above my own to show him how important he was to me.

Despite all of this, it was still damn hard on him. He recently admitted to me that there were times during this 3-year period when he almost lost hope and considered leaving me. I can't tell you how grateful and happy I am that he stuck by me through it all, though. The thought that I could have lost him (and maybe came close to it) over something out of my control that was the side effect of a stupid medication that I regretted taking, is simply gut-wrenching. It is a story with a happy ending though. Our sex life now is way kinkier and more prolific than even the first few weeks of our relationship. And I will NEVER touch hormonal birth control EVER AGAIN."

NotTheBatman,DotA2,1389993256.0,"Its only diminishing returns if magic damage is still resisted instead of amplified. You're right in that veil would be less effective on a rubick or am or pl because of their increased magic resist. However, veil is MORE effective against enemies who are ethereal or silenced by skywrath or under the effect of elder titan's aura.

For a basic example, a 300 damage nuke against a target with normal resistance does 300*0.75=225 damage. Veil would increase this amount by 25 percent, adding 225*0.25=56 more damage after rounding.

Against an antimage with maxed spell shield all magic damage is halved, meaning veil only add 28 damage to a 300 damage nuke.

However, consider a target with normal resistance silenced by skywrath. At max level Skywrath's silence amplifies magic damage by 36%,  meaning a 300 damage nuke now does 300*0.75*1.36=306 damage. Veil now increases this by 25%, meaning a bonus 306*0.25=76.5 bonus damage is added to a 300 damage nuke. 

If you want to get crazy imagine a target under the effect of ET aura, dragonus silence, pugna decrep, and veil. A 300 damage nuke will deal 300*0.75*1.33*1.36*1.4*1.25=712 damage."

I had been using the Anastasia in Medium Ash, which can be built up to be really dark and it's completely ashy, so this one took a few times to get used to. 

I don't know if it's waterproof, but it does definitely stay on my brows all day. I remove my makeup every night with Bioderma and then wash my face and it comes off with the Bioderma. I wish that Sephora would make a few more shades of this since almost all of the shades have some red in them, but if it's not a huge seller, I can understand why they don't.

Tarnsman4Life,AskMen,1389993421.0,"Shooting/Shooting Sports are one of my primary hobbies, however the primary reasons I own firearms are for the purpose of self defense. 



I love rifles the most, especially the often demonized modern sporting rifles (or ""That Sandy Hook Gun"" as my ex-mother in law called AR-15's). Handguns and shotguns are fun to shoot as well. My favorite rifle right now would probably have to be the SCAR-16, handgun I am torn between the P226 and the venerable 1911. Shotgun I am falling in love with the Benelli Super-Nova.

In regards to gun ownership
I am anti gun control, I believe *non-violent* felons should have some sort of ability through a process (Anger Management, community service, Psych eval etc) of regaining their Second Amendment rights. I believe there should be absolutely no licencing requirements for any form of gun ownership or concealed carry. So called ""assault weapon"" bans should be ruled unconstitutional. Registration by any locality or state should be illegal with a fine assessed by the Federal Gov't equal to $100,000.00/Day/Occurrence. 

I believe if someone has a carry permit they should be aloud to carry a firearm in ANY other state so long as local laws(minus the permit) are followed.

I believe there should be a new amendment added to the constitution guaranteeing the right to carry a firearm, concealed or otherwise. 

The ""NFA"" should be done away with, rifles with barrels less than 16"" are no more deadly than those with barrels in excess of 16"". Suppressors if widely available would result in less complains over target shooting/hunting and could save the hearing over time of thousands, especially in a defensive gun use.

I believe the only people permanently prohibited from owning a firearm should be  the mentally ill, convicted *VIOLENT* felons and those convicted of actual spousal abuse.

I believe it should be a constitutional right to defend yourself or your home from imminent danger without the duty to retreat. 



Yeah...I am one of those people who is for the Second Amendment without compromise.

Beauty doesn't serve the same kind of utility. There are not that many things on this planet that you can only get if you are beautiful, whereas there are plenty of things that require money. Having beauty is like winning a contest with no real prize. The main ""benefit"" is that a lot of people will celebrate it. That's not really a tangible benefit. The few things that you can get by being beautiful usually come at the cost of something else. Your powerball example would be more analogous to beauty if you could only use your money to buy from a couple categories of things, and if making a purchase with your powerball money required you to also give up something else you value. Or if every time you buy something with your money, you also have to justify to everyone why you deserve to buy it. "

There's a couple of sites you can find out there that offer moral support, but when it comes down it, I'm doing it for the increased sensitivity and aesthetic, and that's motivation enough for me.  Masturbation and sex are very different, in a good way, and walking around with a covered glans feels, I don't know, empowered or something, in a way I didn't expect.  If you have more questions, fire away.  This is something I feel strongly about."

&gt;contractor or work for the DoD as a civilian, and that's where I see relevant degrees proving their worth.

You could definitely do that.  A piece of advice here, though:

This field is also getting more competitive.  With the military draw-down comes less need for contractors.  In places where there once were lots of contractors, now are only a few, and they're making less.  It's becoming more competitive.

Anecdotal example: I was just talking about this to a contractor that I work with.  His salary (and job opportunities) have been dropping since the Afghanistan draw down.  3 contracts ago, he was making 80k, then 60, and now around 5-55k.  So money is becoming less available for those contracts.  He also said that he only got his most recent job (where he is now) because he knew people in the right places.

Just be aware that it's not as easy as it used to be."

As a gut who makes about 7x more than my SO, the advice two posts up from this is the best in the thread.  It's perfect.  I say this because I've thought through both models of payment and they both break down:

* Pay 50%?  OK, then we don't live in as nice of a place as we could, for no better reason than arbitrary rules.
* Pay mathematically proportional to income?  Because discretionary income tends to be more disproportionate than gross income, we could end up in a situation where she has little spending money.

Right now she pays around 35% of the rent, not because of some equation but because that's a level we're both happy with.  It gives her the satisfaction of contributing, without making her go broke.

I'd argue that it doesn't. I mean, let's say you have a good friend. Your good friend and you play tennis regularly, and both greatly enjoy it. Despite your best efforts for safety, during your tennis match, your friend is injured, and requires an organ transplant.

Now, it's discovered that you're the only person compatible with your buddy. So the government seizes you, and forces you to undergo a long, dangerous surgery with serious potential effects for your health, to save you friend's life. You have no choice, and now have to live without a kidney or whatever. Your friend survives.

That is, to me, unconscionable, but it's what forcing a pregnancy does. Even if you accept that a fetus or xygote is an independent human life, I don't think the government has the right to force you to sacrifice your time, health, energy, and body to save it. If your kid were dying of leukemia, nobody is going to hold you down and force you to give bone marrow. Pregnancy can cause diabetes, heart issues, and a host of other complications for the mother, up to and including death.

Most of the developped world outside of the US seems to consider that protecting a few easily replaceable objects and cash is not something to kill or be killed over. Soldiers and police officers who are forced to kill someone, even when it's for perfectly clear and legitimate reasons, are often traumatized for it.

False. Portugal is now a creatable titular title. One can create it, make a super duke in old dejure Portugal, and name them king of titular Portugal. If they last 100 years, Portugal will be restored dejure.  

Edit: I did this with Navarra. I did it strategically to undermine a powerful vassal. Navarra went titular at some point, so I created it and held it for the occasion.

I think also the reason you have such a hard time accepting the approach I am discussing is that you assume that approach doesn't include being overall outgoing, and charming. I am merely saying that if OP isn't into casual dating, he needs to get out there and make a lot of acquaintances and some good, close friends. Both approaches require you to be outgoing, active, and practicing your social skills. One is with a short-term goal of making a casual romantic connection with someone, the other is a short-term goal of just making a casual connection with someone. The approaches aren't super different, and get easier with practice. The main difference is in one, you're fucking that person you just met right away (or any other kind of beyond-friend intimacy). As hard as it may be for you to believe, but it is more than possible to exude confidence and desirability without painting on the walls ""hey girl, let's fuck"" within the first couple of meetings. Guys find themselves in a self preceived ""friend zone"" when they don't have the confidence to begin with and never wind up developing with that female friend.

There are two main differences in our approaches: First, mine accepts that you don't need to go in thinking about sexual/romantic intentions off the bad for them to be a possibility, and can employ them later on with the right amount of confidence. Second, I see a LTR as something mutually constructed between both partners, not something a man ""lands"" even if he more likely has to take the role of pushing it over the hump of happening. "

First thing in the morning, I was to take out a legal pad and, in approximately 60 seconds, make a 20-item to-do list. It was called the ""list of 20."" It could include routine things that were to be done every day, big chores that happened only periodically, or little tasks that I'd noticed needed to be done. Not 19 things, not 21, but 20 exactly.

As time went on, I came to see the value of this exercise. At many points throughout the day, I found myself completing a task and wondering what to do next. And I didn't need to think about it, because I could glance at the list of 20 and do one of those. Sometimes someone I managed would ask me what he could do. Again, I reached for the  list of 20.

I never completed all 20 items on the list. That's not what the list was for. If you got all the items done, you made the wrong list.

At the end of the day, you throw the list away. Nothing carries over to the next day. You get some sleep, come back to work, and make a new list based on the new reality you face.

FollowerofLoki,polyamory,1389994051.0,"Well, if you ever consider making things permanent here are some things I've found that people don't tend to talk about as much because they're usually ""assumed"" in monogamous relationships.

1. Children. When/if to have them, what sort of strategies to use, the legal paperwork you're going to have to get if all three of you coparent, etc. 

2. Living arrangements. Be clear where the boundaries are. Does one or more of you need more time alone? Best to be upfront about that and try to find a good area that they can have that ""me"" spot. 

3. More of a subset of 2, but chores. Try to be as even-handed as possible because that sort of thing can create resentment faster than you can say ""why haven't you done the dishes today?"" 

4. Finances. This is a biggie! The majority of relationships get strained by financial issues. I know it's not exactly a ""romantic"" type of thing, but keeping individual bank accounts, and maybe a single ""house"" account seems to be the best way to sort things to my mind, but you'll find what works for you best.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389994059.0,"We need SOME level of oligarchy...we need experts to run things, but these experts should be responsible to the people.

Economically, I'm for private enterprise and think people should follow their dreams, it's just that in doing so you should be mindful of the consequences and empathetic toward those who are not as successful as you. I think that interactions must be controlled in order to ensure the greater good. So I'm for regulation and taxation, but otherwise you maintain your ownership and are entitled to the fruits of your success. 

It's good to use self interest in order to encourage people to produce and innovate. It's just that such priorities must be BALANCED with others. I have a distaste for pure socialism/communism like I have a distaste for anarcho capitalism and libertarianism, quite frankly. I'm actually quite a bit of a fan of the horseshoe theory. I think the far left and right both have problematic ideals. They both propose these unrealistic idealized worlds that would be horrible to live in either way. The problem with the left wing, assuming a truly DEMOCRATIC framework rather than the authoritarian framework communists have tried in the past, is that in its extreme, it would destroy all incentive to work and innovate. In order to progress, we need some level of private ownership and some level of inequality to reward people who innovate and succeed. I just don't have the absolutist ""I'm entitled to the fruits of my labor **** everyone else"" attitude of the libertarians/ancaps. 

As I said, I'm a fan of social democracy. I like stuff, like, for example, the Nordic model and all. I'm for a largely capitalist framework, but under tons of regulation and with numerous social programs on the side in order to reduce exploitation and achieve the most desireable results for all of society.

I think if we have voluntary socialized, ie, democratic companies, that's nice, but I don't think it should be mandated that all companies are state/people controlled or anything like that, so I can't really call myself a socialist. 

Btw, my comment about pictures of lenin is surfing through I really did find an infographic talking about how lenin and mao because socialists at a young age and it's never too early to become one...idk, just rubbed me the wrong way."

keatonch,Scotch,1389994188.0,"OK! so some quick suggestions! find something called wine gas. Don't  argue. With an expensive malt like this (Especially a peaty one like Caol Ila with lots of oxidizable phenols) you'll want to preserve and protect it from the terrors of oxidization correctly, because you're not going to be having it often! You'll find that the longer and more often that the bottle is open and poured from, the more oxidation you'll perceive, (obviously!) Which can sometimes ruin your scotch. Especially if you don't drink from it often and **especially** if the cork dries out.
 
I would suggest getting some wine gas. Wine gas contains Argon, CO2, and Nitrogen gas which, when applied inside of the bottle with the little straw thingy, forms 3 progressive layers of protection (the most important being Argon which is heavier than O2 and thus displaces it above the scotch-gas interface.) This keeps O2 from messing up your beautiful malt. Thus ensuring happy times for you and your fiancee! 

Also storing your bottle on it's side keeps the cork wet so that it won't dry out and crumble into the scotch/let O2 diffuse in. 

P.S. Even getting a wine saver hand vacuum pump thing helps out a lot. I tend to use that on some of my expensive bottles that I know I'll drink within 6 months, but I don't want to leave unprotected. Also your fiancee is awesome. Great taste in scotch."

The .gif shows a frontal offset collision, which cars have historically have been terrible at. They are the most dangerous accidents, yet more common than a full head on collision (usually at least one car will try to avoid). The small overlap frontal crash tests (25% overlap, 40mph) weren't even [tested until 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIHS#Small_overlap_frontal_test).

This is likely the toughest test to design for as it has a large impact over a very small area of the car, and the car must be able to absorb and spread the impact to keep the occupants safe."

In fact it didn't appear to investigate whether or not the women who had issues had any underlying conditions during pregnancy.  Preeclampsia or gestational diabetes to name but a few.  Correlation does not equal causation.  The truth of the matter is that some women just have difficulties and honestly talking about pain meds as the culprit is the easiest scapegoat. Even when you see a direct correlation there is no proof of causation.  Many women had issues breastfeeding way before pain meds were introduced to the process.

Consequently, ATV saw more targets than J-Mac did this year. But he also made a lot of plays on those passes, and earned a well-deserved trip to the Pro Bowl for it.  

It should also be pointed out that Verner didn't come completely out of nowhere. He's been a solid player taking a lot of defensive snaps for us for several years, playing primarily nickel during his first two seasons before moving to the outside in 2012. He upped his game this year and became a more consistent playmaker, but it probably hasn't come as a total shock to most Titans fans - I think many saw this kind of potential in him. "

wolfkin,boardgames,1389994339.0,Love Letter is CHEAP. LIke dirt cheap. Part of the reason everyone talks about it is because it's way more fun than it should be for the cost. I recommend buying it anyway as an add on. After 3 rounds of Bohnanza or Alhambra or the hectic Anomia you'll want to close out the night with something you can just sit play and have a beer with and Love Letter is perfect for that. Heck I carry it with me everywhere. I've been known to break it out at a restaurant while waiting for food to arrive. At $7 it's worth every penny and more.

silverionmox,rpg,1389994636.0,"&gt; If the society considers women equal to men for the purposes of nobility and ruling a nation, there's no reason a peasant woman wouldn't also be considered at least mostly equal to a peasant man.

Surely there is. If in doubt, compare the output of man and a woman on basic farming tasks like chopping wood or digging a field... or swinging a sword, for that matter.

&gt;In such a society, a farmer on a prosperous, successful farm isn't going to consider his eldest daughter as ""less than"" the eldest son of the neighboring, struggling farm.

It's a common misconception that women were ""considered less"" in medieval society. It was mostly a matter of distribution of tasks within the family: when possible, women would concern themselves with the household rather than the typical tasks outside the house. This could very well include doing part of the family business (eg. some of Bach's pieces are know to be written by his wife at that time). From time to time widows did become the head of the family for official and commercial matters - there are numerous well-known examples in nobility. Likewise, sailors' or soldiers' wives did so when their husband was away on his duty, which could quite conceivably turn out to be years, if not forever. Class trumps gender in all aspects.

People are dumb on both sides but there is a tiny core of Americans in the middle who listen to reason and make up their mind without having to scrutinize their politics to make a decision based on the common good of the country.  They make the minor forces that help sway the pendulum one way or another.

ibbity,AskWomen,1389994731.0,"While it's certainly true that on average women are looking for different things at different points in their lives, it's also true that women who want ONS or short fun flings will prefer a man who also wants these, while women who want a steady LTR will prefer a man who also wants this.

Let's say that two people are looking for different things in life. One demographic behaves in ways that person A would find conducive to their goal, and another in ways that person B would find conducive to *their* goal. Demographic 1's behavior would spell a huge amount of trouble for person B and threaten their ability to achieve their goal. The same is true of demographic 2 and person A. 

Now, assuming that both persons are observant enough to differentiate between the two demographics on the basis of their traits and behavior, which demographic would each person logically find more appealing? The one that's conducive to their desired outcome and exhibits traits that would aid them in achieving it, or the one that's *not* conducive to their desired outcome and exhibits traits that would hamper or prevent their achieving it?

Where this can break down is with the persons of both type A and B who are too foolish, naive, ignorant, or unobservant to notice or understand the differences between demographics 1 and 2, or to figure out the type of behavior they might reasonably expect from said demographics and its potential effect on their end goal. However, in the majority of cases of persons type A and B who are intelligent and observant, you *will* see a marked tendency for person A to match up with someone from demographic 1, while person B matches up with someone from demographic 2.

Mehknic,Pathfinder_RPG,1389994731.0,"True.  Could be running a ZAM or bard, I suppose.  I just skipped right to Ranger for some reason when reading this thread.

On a Ranger, Quickdraw is either level 1 or level 3 for me.  Power Attack being the other one...why waste a ton of feats on ranged feat taxes when the Ranged Specialization lets you take the best ones without feat tax.  Sure, it's a bit slow for the first few levels, but archery is in general...why not beat the crap out of things in melee when they get close instead of dancing trying to make feat-intensive archery work.  An optimized ZAM doesn't get rolling until wis-to-hit at 4, bard is 3/4 BAB and probably arcane archer or something, and Archer-Fighter is slogging through the taxes."

The SSPX have apparently removed the article from their website but there's a commentary on it [here](http://www.cfnews.org/page88/files/14e8cf27a431ca52105cf70b45567b82-149.html)

Southern California (SoCal), is (as I've heard) where the stereotypes of Californians come from.  If you've watched SNL's ""The Californians"" skit then that's the gist of SoCal/LA.

There's Central California, and I know nothing about it but I assume that's where the surfers are from.

There's Silicon Valley where any tech company you can think of probably has at least 2 office in.

The Bay Area is where San Francisco is located, as well as Berkley and Oakland (to name a few well known areas).

There's the Central Valley where the Capital is located and that's where a lot of farmland is located, as well as business centers.

TheDrunkenChud,skeptic,1389995001.0,"it's a simple argument: laws don't save lives. no law, will ever save your life. people obeying laws makes life easier, but people disregarding laws can cost lives. legally, you have to stop at a red light. this law does not save your life. people obeying it do. you, obeying a green light and someone disobeying a red light can cost you your life. 

now, on to the topic it at hand, gun control simply stops legal ownership of firearms. now, once someone has decided to commit a murder, they have already broken the law. murder. whether they use a gun or not is meaningless as the law says that murder is illegal. laws don't save lives when people decide to take lives.

Yes, I do think society looks at men and women differently. I think Men are judged as attractive based not only on their naked physical appearance, but also on the persona they create or their, for lack of a better word: ""swag"". A lot goes into a mans overall attractiveness. 

I think when society looks at women, they place a lot more value on naked appearance.

I'm just basically fed up with wearing wet shoes all day since i never have more than one pair of shoe at any time, I only buy new shoes when my present ones are worn out entirely. 

The problem with this so far for me is, all the boots I search around for are so damn expensive, even when i look at the Frugal_male fashion subreddit, the deals aren't even that frugal, they are still around the $200 range. How come there are no boots that are like 30-50 dollars that one can purchase and still consider really good against the winter weather.

There are three admits so far that are beneath their typical GPA hardline of about 3.0-3.2 (http://texas.lawschoolnumbers.com/stats/1213).

Yet, there are some people around the same LSAT that were rejected. What can we observe from this data? Once you are below that GPA threshold, those softs matter and being just generic won't get you in. But what will make a difference is that they are good. Does a 3.3 have a better chance? Assuming an equal LSAT, sure. However, that's why I claim you have to have strong softs. That 3.3 may still get rejected, but you'd really better your chance with good softs since you're below median. Similarly the 2.75 will need good softs since they're below median. Both aren't helping, so need something to make them worthwhile to take a chance on."

ebonlance,TumblrInAction,1389995366.0,"But that's the thing - an actual interview informs the process so much that the point of this exercise is rendered useless.

Women's working habits involve risk on the part of a hiring manager, which are generally clarified as part of an interview. In this ridiculous situation where I have to assign a salary based solely on a mediocre resume, the woman is quantitatively worth less because a woman is statistically more likely to need time off, call in sick more often, less likely to work beyond 9-5, etc. In the real world you call them in for an interview to get a sense of their working habits and whether or not, despite appearances to the contrary, they'd be a good fit. 

It would be like asking whether I'd prefer to buy a car and assign a value to it based only on its mileage and accident report, and randomly assigned Ford or Honda to it. If I say it's worth 10K as a Honda and 5K as a Ford, that's informed by knowledge that Hondas generally perform better and retain value better than Fordes. But that's not how people buy cars - they go into the dealership and check to see if it's actually decent. That stops me from purchasing a 1987 civic over a new focus. 

The methodology is so far removed from the way people are hired in real life that it's very hard to take seriously in terms of predicting how hiring trends operate in the real world."

ShamelesslyPlugged,40krpg,1389995394.0,"If you look at a Nimitz-class Aircraft carrier, according to Wikipedia, they have two fission reactors rated at 550 MWh with a crew of under 6,000 and a length of 300-ish meters.  

A Los Angeles-class attack submarine has a single reactor rated at 150-165 MWh. They are about 100 meters and have a crew of 130ish.  

A Cobra-class destroyer is 1.5km long and has a crew of 15,000ish.  

If we go by size, we're looking at 150-350 MWh/100 meters for a total of 2250-5250 MWh. By crew amount, which might be a be a better indicator, it's 0.2 to 1 per crewman for a total of 3000-15000 MWh. Granted, you probably need to put in a SciFi modifier, and a destroyer/fast attack craft is going to be more sublike than carrierlike, although the carrier presents a better ""hub of activity"" like an inefficient Imperial vessel. Frankly, we'd be better off just making up a number.  

On the other hand, your number of reactors is off to me. I would say the ship would have 1-3 centralized, large reactors that then power the engines, shields, and batteries with auxiliary systems being drawn from the batteries. I believe all the electronics on a carrier are run by that nuclear generator, and there's only two. 15-17 reactors seems excessive, and having each system with an independent reactor seems like unnecessary redundancy/compartmentalization."

Consumers don't have time to sift through experimental auto safety features to decide which ones are the most important. A single emergent technology is unlikely to be the deciding factor in a car purchase. Manufacturers don't want to take on the additional manufacturing costs of installing these features, *and* the marketing costs of explaining them to customers, so that *maybe* enough of the market will shift to have made investing in these features worth it.

Of course, these aren't hard and fast rules. Car companies install and promote new features every year, some of which are safety features. But they *are* significant barriers."

For personal use, body fat% and lean body mass is more important to understand.

Body fat % is literally the percentage of your body that is fat. Anywhere between 10%-20% is considered decent for men, and something like 15%-25% for women.

Having more lean body mass - all the other stuff in your body that isn't fat, is good, since the most variable factor in this is muscle, since organs and bones and so forth don't change a ton.

mkvgtired,worldnews,1389995428.0,"That sounds perfect to me. It seems like a lot of heavily traveled countries try to ""put on a show"" for tourists, if that makes any sense. Even in rich countries you have so many ""must see"" things to do when you visit you completely miss the opportunity to learn how people really live. You can often get away from it, but its always visible. In the West we do a great job at memorializing our past, but it is usually displayed in glass and stainless steel museums. I think remembering the past is important, and am not trying to minimize how we do it, but you dont get the same feel. 

I was in Eastern Turkey and Northern Iraq last winter and it was incredible. In Northern Iraq I went to a museum on the Kurdish genocide. It was a former prison and Ba'ath party/secret police headquarters. They left it as it was when they took control of it from Saddam's Ba'ath party. They changed one room and made it a hallway of lights. 180,000+ shards of glass for each person the Ba'aths killed and 4,800 little lights for each village he destroyed. 

Other than that, reinforced concrete guard towers were still on their side. The buildings still riddled with unrepaired bullet holes. Most of all, there was an ""interrogation"" room. It still had the rusty rings in the wall they used to chain people to. Despite the floor being clean, pools of blood had completely stained the concrete a reddish brown color that will be with that place forever. 

I was the only visitor in the entire complex of buildings and it has a much more raw and moving feel to it than you get from the sterilized Western version. It is definitely one of my favorite, if not my favorite, museums I've ever been to.

Unrepentant_Priapist,PoliticalDiscussion,1389995570.0,"&gt; BECAUSE of minimum wage!!!! 

Actually, gas pumps used to require an attendant due to older pumps being rather dangerous.  Modern designs are much safer, so the requirement has been relaxed.  Interestingly, New Jersey and Oregon still have outdated laws on the books *requiring* full-service gas stations for that reason.

If you own a gas station, why on earth would you bother to hire a kid to pump gas even at $2/hour, when your customers are willing to do it themselves for nothing?  I mean, why bother incurring the extra expense for no discernible gain?

&gt; So we should have laws that exempt certain people from other bad laws?

We refine laws with new laws and exemptions all the time, as we become aware of unintended consequences, etc.  That aside, you're arguing from a flawed premise, as [minimum wage laws do not reduce employment](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf), and it's also debatable whether minimum wage laws are bad laws.  Think about it from an employer's perspective:  You have X amount of work that needs to be done in order to meet demand; you have little choice but to pay the going rate dictated by law and market rate.  Let's use the local wage exemptions for farm work that I mentioned as an example:  Those exist because farmers lobbied the state government for them due to the economic hardship associated with high minimum wage for farmhands.  They couldn't simply close the gap by hiring less employees or reducing work shifts; they had a certain amount of work they needed done dictated by demand for their goods.

That being said, I do agree that there are circumstances in which minimum wage laws would be superfluous, but that's a separate discussion."

newsedition,SQL,1389995620.0,"It looks like other folks have covered a lot of the syntax stuff, but I'm really bugged by the fact that you've got your procedure codes hard-coded into your stored procedure, rather than having hooks for the appropriate procedure codes stored in the database somewhere. 

I'm sure you've got a table for your procedure/service codes. It might make sense to have a column that designates them as viable for this list, and then reference them that way. It will make whatever aspect of those procedures that makes them viable for your list apparent to someone looking at the data, so they hopefully don't have to dig through stored procedures to see which procedures/services fit the criteria, and if there are services/procedures that need to be added or subtracted from the list, it can be handled in one place in your data, rather than in every stored procedure that operates on this set of procedure codes. 

I've had to fix this exact sort of thing in our data dozens of times, and it's a pain in the ass that could have been avoided. While healthcare codesets don't change terribly often, they aren't static, and it's much easier to address the changes in the data than it is in the stored procedures."

madcowbomber,Christianity,1389995626.0,"That's a fair point.  I've been thinking a lot about how one might express their belief in a less hurtful way.  Often the way I talk about it is to qualify my statements by saying that it's a result of my interpretation or the way I read the Bible.  I think the abrasive part of saying ""The Bible says homosexuality is wrong"" is that it doesn't acknowledge the role of one's *interpretation* in that statement.   After all, you might say ""The Bible says eating shrimp is wrong"", but we don't interpret that statement the same way.  Everyone needs to acknowledge that their interpretation of what the Bible says may be flawed.

Also, clobber verses.  We all know about Leviticus and Romans. There is little or nothing to be gained from dragging them out again.  It is unproductive. Every American, certainly every gay and/or Christian American, is aware of what the Bible says on homosexuality, and we as a church, especially as a conservative church, need to find ways to *unconditionally* love and show grace, just as we have been unconditionally loved and shown grace.

The last thing I want is for conservative voices to be silenced or ghettoized.  I love their passion for the Bible and for righteousness.  I hope that my comments can lead towards a more useful and productive conversation on this incredibly important subject. "

You'll need to network your way into an interview and then crush it to stand out from the pack (you'll be considered a ""non-target"" which makes things tougher).

If you're really budgeting then student guides are a good place to look.

For example, today I made an omelette with Sainsbury's basics cooking bacon. Cheap as hell, but its all the odd cuttings and not pre-sliced so I had to spend more time cutting it up and its not what you'd fry for breakfast. You could pay several times that for nicer, sliced bacon.

What I can tell you is that it will be cheaper than eating out.

celosia89,TheGameIsOn,1389996058.0,"because he(the writers) aren't up to date on psychological terms? It makes me wince every time it's mentioned.

Sociopath is the old term, current term is psychopath and neither was included in the dsm-iv. Psychopathy is a personality disorder which means that it's enduring and while patients can learn to display the correct behaviors, the disorder is always there. All psychopaths were kids with antisocial-behavior(not ""oh I don't like people"" or awkwardness but violating norms and mores), but not all antisocial kids become psychopaths. Also, they are nearly all high functioning hence the theory that c level executives are mostly psychopaths. They are great at imitating emotions and manipulating people. Source: Abnormal psych class and text book three years ago, so dsm-v may override some of this

We've seen that he has his own emotions, but is also great at imitating them to use people without remorse. We haven't heard any stories of him killing/torturing animals as a child and he doesn't really violate mores, but he does violate norms left right and center. Also, he seems to be getting more normal so that doesn't fit either. 
Overall I think you're right that he wears the self assigned label as armor. If he has an incurable personality disorder then he cannot truly change. He likely also uses the connotation more than the actual definitions of the disorder, he wants people to be off balance and be unsure of him to keep them away."

I mean why insult the guy and say he has a sad life for feeling a certain way even if you think its immature?"

[Only 40% of the population in the United States have college degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_attainment_in_the_United_States), as of 2012.  [Raw numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau here](http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/), if you're interested.  You seem to possess remarkably inaccurate perceptions of various issues.

&gt; Why would they ever hire someone without a degree if there are so many people with degrees?

For exactly the reasons I stated (they're less expensive and easier to retain, if you don't require the skills that accompany a particular degree), especially given that, as I've already demonstrated, there are more people available without degrees than with them."

As for viable mek carriers, OD is one, though it delays his int core and makes him come online later (though it makes him much more durable).  Viper is another.  Like Razor, viper is less reliant on damage items to be effective and can really use the durability.  

Pretty much any hero that isn't usually mana starved and needs some durability is good to pick up a mek on.  Particularly if they need some durability.  Pugna is good as well, as it synergizes with his early push. 

You don't want to get it on supports who are generally mana starved, imo.  Like ES, Tiny, Etc.

They are considered egosyntonic disorders. This means that the disorder serves their ego so they see no reason to change it."" And about therapy for personality disordered people: ""There have been some strides at treating certain aspects of certain personality disorders. The gold standard for Borderline Personality is Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, which is primarily mindfulness based and developed specifically for that disorder, but even this simply controls symptoms.""

It is completely believable that two bishops were child molestors and possibly complicit in crimes. But you are obsessively honing in on Catholic clergy as if they were the only sex criminals in the world and taking it to the point of bigotry.

The kind of man who becomes a priest and becomes a sex criminal is the kind of man who became a priest because he desired power, not because of any religious devotion. 

These are the men whose skulls pave the roads of hell and I am certain these bishops' spines are the sign posts.

The problem is not the Catholic priesthood. It is power-seeking sexual deviants infiltrating clergy.

A time of massive crisis in the Church had been prophesied by saints prior to the twentieth century and the infiltration of the priesthood by sexual deviants is a prime example.

However, to act as if priests are the one and only demographic to molest, as if they did it as a disproportionately high rate, and to lay the blame entirely on scheming bureaucrats in the Church is wrong.

xthorgoldx,Frisson,1389996664.0,"Two words: Plot immortality. In most works, characterization requires a good deal of time. In an action story involving baseline humans, people tend to die *very quickly.* so you have the choice of having a very large number of less-developed characters (a la Band of Brothers) or a small number of inexplicably lucky/skilled/badass developed characters (Noble Team from Reach).

The problem with the latter is that a character skilled enough to survive realistic action will be considered a demigod or unbelievable - a guy who takes bullets every episode and still fights breaks suspension of disbelief when everyone else is ginned by wounds half as bad. Ditto for a sufficiently lucky character - either it's mistaken for skill (demigod) or it breaks disbelief (how many times is he *barely* going to dodge the explosion?).

Take something like *24.* Would you say that Jack Bauer is a believable human? Not even close. He's a demigod, otherwise the story would be boring because he'd get killed, captured, or just plain stumped. The story can't end like that, though, so he gets skill and luck that propel him beyond the believable into a realm where he *can* win. This plot armor is tempered by faux setbacks that maintain a net-zero score between the hero and villain (generating conflict to drive the story), which only tips in the hero's favor in the climax.

In other words, stories rely on the hero overcoming adversity. In action stories, adversity tends to be rampant death. To ensure the hero survives to overcome the adversity, he's given the power to hand wave bus survival, through skill or luck. Because giving a person powers stresses suspension of disbelief, it's easier to do with a character who has a *reason* to have such power ups (elite, superhuman, badasses)."

Skulder,patientgamers,1389996747.0,"The game was developed as a spiritual successor to System Shock (and System Shock 2), and I feel that they captured the atmosphere pretty well - the tension, the reveal, the mindfuck, the turnaround, and the shocker - the game was damn illusionist, always making you think the plot was in the other box all along.

I'm going to copy-paste some praise from a gamespot article about System Shock 2 - and even though the game is 20 years old, I'll put it behind a spoiler tag, just because you might want to go further back yet. (fans have made high-res textures, widescreen support and lots of other stuff, that actually makes the old game worth playing - it's awesome.

[](#s ""You awaken on the historic vessel Von Braun to find the rest of the crew slaughtered...or worse, mutated into monstrosities beyond recognition. A terrible biological collective known as the Many has overrun the Von Braun and its piggybacked security ship, the Rickenbacker, and as the lone survivor, it's up to you to investigate the horrible goings-on and find a way off the doomed, derelict ships."")

[](#s ""But then, you're not really the only survivor of the disaster. Almost from the beginning, you receive help via voice comm from a scientist allegedly stranded in the upper decks of the ship. Midway through the game, you finally reach her hiding place, only to discover that the assistance has been coming from none other than SHODAN, the malevolent AI from the original game, who through a series of strange circumstances has become embedded in the Von Braun's computer system. This unseen twist ranks right up there with ""Aeris dies"" as one of the most shocking and effective video game plot devices we've ever encountered. The game goes on to surprise you again and again with new developments and ingenious ties to the original game, finally culminating in yet another brilliant twist that has left us aching for a sequel these last six years."")

I have to say, though, that I never played Bioshock 2 - I didn't want to return to Rapture in another form. I'd developed some nostalgic idea about rapture, and I didn't really want to have it altered by another version."

But having stated that my most likely belief based on what you have said is that he is attracted to you sexually and likes you, but he is keeping his options open for someone else that he might have a greater affection for.

I.e you were the back up, and he would of gone with you, if his other potential failed to work out, but he believes he has a realistic chance with her so is distancing himself from you.

cincodenada,funny,1389996794.0,"The distinction here is that 14 in and of itself, *as a number* is continuous (indescrete) - it's part of a number line, the set of real numbers that can be infinitely divided.  So 14 is *less than* 15.

When you're talking about ""14 items"" however, 14 is now in the set of integers, because items are discrete.  So a bag of 14 oranges has *fewer* fruits than one with 15 oranges.

Basically, if you're counting individual things (14 items), it's fewer.  If it's just two amounts of stuff, it's less.  Numbers by themselves are points on an infinite line, so they're arbitrary amounts of stuff.

Now, to stir the pot further, and address the plural nuance jonwd7 was noting: if you've got a giant bin of oranges, and then a half-full giant bin of oranges, the half-full has fewer oranges, but less fruit - because ""fruit"" is a collective noun, and you're no longer referring to individual oranges, but one big pile of fruit."

TIGit,Automate,1389996893.0,"Unions can be effective, but like all good tools must be used properly. Hammers make terrible screwdrivers, ya? 

Workers should organize though, unionization would improve many jobs. It's not as simple as ""export jobs to China"" which we've been doing since GATT in 1982-1984 which really hit our industries the hardest 1986-1991 (when our stock market crashed in 1991).

We have not exported all the jobs that could possibly be exported, that's true. For some reason there are still telemarketing/customer help desk people in America, fewer but still existant. But the reason primarily is angry customers want to be empathized with and a computer can't do that (at the moment) and Indian telecom services have accent divides that can put off customers. These are like so man by other jobs, could likely be exported but are not at the moment.

But you can't export every job to China. It's why the US has a largely service based economy, such services require boots on the ground and can't be accomplished electronically from foreign soil. Remaining job sectors in the US, especially those with a hold of large amounts of capital investment (ie factories, laboratories, etc) should unionize. Shutting them down and shipping the equipment, building new facilities, training new workers, down time costs, loss of sales, customer problems just make it not worth it. It's a far more cost effective to just give the unionized workers a small raise than to spend the couple hundred million of moving these types of jobs."

Usually people  had three gun or types , .22 , a shotgun and a bolt action rifle for deer. If you had more then one of the type is because you either inherited it or you bought a better one when you were older and kept the old one. Only people who talked and acted like some of the gun culture does today were old guys who smelled faintly of pee and old apples who would be collecting model trains or farm implements / tools the same way .

I'm with you 100%. I'm still in a position where my life is not stable from a career/financial standpoint, and I can't seriously commit to a relationship without having a reasonable guarantee of that stability.

pigeonburger,AskMen,1389997150.0,"I don't know what the mugger is going to do, but it's extremely likely that if I comply no one is going to get hurt; it is not in any way in a mugger's interest to kill or hurt me, and turn the already serious crime of (armed) robbery into murder or assault.

As for being safer with a gun; it's pretty obvious that if I pull a gun it's immediately much more likely that someone is going to get hurt, and it might very well be me. You're immediately increasing the odds that you're going to die; a situation that was not about life and death suddenly became so.

There's a good reason why the police recommends that citizens comply with a legitimately threatening* mugger's demands. Playing the macho ""Just they try to take MY stuff!"" guy is supremely juvenile, gets more people killed over stupid shit like a pair of shoes worth a few bucks imported by the boatload from China than doing the mature thing, which is to comply, then report the crime to the police in as much detail as possible.

The molds can sell for a good amount (I bought two small molds for $22 USD on ebay) same for the glaze and books which can be easy to ship so you make a profit. The electric wheel and the kiln you would have to find a specific buyer through craigslist, see which type they are and the model and if the company is still in existence and whoever wants it can buy parts for it then you will have better luck (few people want a kiln they cant buy shelves for, might as well build their own if they want to do that).

monolithdigital,AdviceAnimals,1389997186.0,"Basically a lot of anti-femenists value the ability to think as you wish, and speak (with reasonable responsibility) without fear from soceity. Since the usual ways it gets advocated are when someone goes after an easy target (he's a bad guy, so whatever I do is ok) and would rather have someone they detest, than a situation where people have to censor themselves. They prefer to let general prosperity and the gentrification of society work in it's slow, methodical way.

And replace 'patriarchy' or whatever you want to use to describe your boogeyman, and replace it with any other criminal activity, and see how the logic holds...

Pretty much not a single oppressive opinion people have really translates well into the public sphere. Arguable the religous right, but thats more an issue with their solidarity as a voting bloc, than people letting it run wild... Luckily for femenism, women as a voting group don't have that issue with mysogenists.

Unless you have an example of that kind of speak actually translating into policy.

I can recall only one recent example, that whole right wing abortion crap last year, and that didn't make it very far. didn't even need femenism, just self respecting women and their families, plus anyone with a shred of dignity for human rights

I use the Spacers when I use my Bones Swiss, I like to crank the axle nuts, it makes my powerslides and reverts a lot more predictable and it seems like I have more slide control.

silverionmox,belgium,1389997345.0,"&gt; Or, one could argue that transport is a basic public good, and that regardless of spending power (e.g. a student) you should be able to get where you need to be.

It seems normal social behaviour to take into account the needs of others and the expected traffic density. If people don't do that spontaneously, pricing might be one of the ways to distribute limited resources among people (students/pensioners with little money and a lot of flexibility vs. working people with moderate incomes and little schedule flexibility). Heaven knows the real big shots don't do trains. A price difference doesn't need to be a price increase; it could be lower prices in the less busy hours as well, and both can still be way below the price according to the market.

Ideally, employers wouldn't be so controlling of their employees' schedule and the problem could solve itself. Many traffic jams are induced by a traffic increase of a few percentages - and therefore can be prevented that way. In addition, obviously we don't have enough investments in public transport - or consideration for it in spatial planning - but those are medium and long term solutions respectively."

oldneckbeard,cscareerquestions,1389997478.0,"I've been coding just about as long as you've been alive, and I do interviewing regularly, so here's some stuff to remember: 

1. Most shit you do before 18 doesn't matter. It probably wasn't in a professional capacity. If you compare yourself to people with 11 years of professional experience, you're going to be disappointed in everything. 
2. Phone interviews are hard for both parties. Bad interviewers pepper you with trivia and errata. Bad interviewees can't code a FizzBuzz solution but still want me to pay them 100k/yr. 
3. Don't expect people to get to know *you*. The interviewer probably phone screens 5-10 people per week, more if they're really desperate. Everyone becomes a nameless blob on the other end. Unless you impress me enough that we do an in-person interview, I'm probably not even going to look at your git hub or any other site. 
4. The stuff you mentioned about ""quick learner"" etc are all great qualities in a developer. Keep doing that. But it's impossible to figure that out in a full-day interview, much less a phone screen. Those qualities will help you build a network of people who want to work with you, though. 
5. Again, just so you remember: being an interviewer is HARD. There are a lot of people who just shouldn't be doing it, who are forced to do it. It's up to you to wow them, they just want to get off the phone and go back to their problem. "

Wealth inequality is exactly what you need. Not extreme inequality but you need aspirations. If everyone was equal what would you study for 7 years to be a doctor when you can drop out and earn the same amount and live the same life? What sane person would do that? Inequality creates an aspirational society. I see the rich guys in the huge houses with beautiful wives and $500,000 lumps of german metal on their front drives and I want to be them. And other people are no doubt the same. It gives you something to strive for. Something to work for and aim to. Without that, there's nothing to work for. 

Plutocracies are a problem, but that's because the USA hasn't done anything about corporate sponsorship in politics. If they did something similar to the UK in banning huge donations and limiting spending on campaigns then they wouldn't have that issue.

Oligarchies are market failures. Sometimes state intervention is needed to fix them (I think the UK needs to re-nationalise the rail &amp; energy industries), sometimes you need to de-regulate to fix them. It depends on the market.

Fiscal liberalism is a silly concept. You can't have total equality. Human nature does not allow it. There will always be greed and selfishness. You can't fight it. So there's no point trying to. Create a society where aspiration, innovation and hard work are rewarded. "

Wonderful when you're selling a $15,000 Bronze, discouraging when a painting goes for $50. 

It's a nice feedback loop, because the more money we make for our Consignor, the more money we get. 

If tax is applicable that's added after the premium.  If you have a business license you're tax-exempt - we get a lot of dealers at our auctions. 

Be sure you understand the terms and conditions - although it might be a new concept to you, we're (as an industry, as well as speaking personally) not looking to screw you. 

Auctioneers want happy customers on both sides of the transaction because reputation is HUGE. 

I know my boss has returned merchandise (before an auction) because it was misrepresented.

I used to complain about the attention I'd get from men-- because it was intensely unwanted. I made it clear it was unwanted by telling them I have a boyfriend or girlfriend or that I wasn't looking, whatever the case was, and they would* still persist*. 

Luckily nowadays I work at a place where my boyfriend used to work, so the employees and frequent customers got to know us as partners and don't bother me, and also after years of being hit on constantly, I have a thicker skin and am better at discouraging people.

local_weather,WorldofTanks,1389997605.0,"I'll comment on the Soviet line starting at the tier 5 SU-85:

Excellent camo values, some of the best in the game.  

5, 6, 7 and 8 have good mobility once you get the engines upgraded.  Of course, 7,8 are a bit slower and 9 has mediocre speed.

6, 8, 9 have excellent guns for their tier.  Getting the 122 on the SU-100 gives you a taste of what having the gun that matters on the map is like.

The grind from 7 to 8 is actually fun.  The SU-152 with the big derp is pretty fun to play and it's nice to start getting revenge on tanks that you once feared by blowing them up in one shot from the big derp HE.  Plus the tank starts with the gun you will use for the whole grind.

Armor on all of them up to 9 (haven't played the 10 yet) is OK for their tier in the front only.  With the right angling you have decent survivability.  

All of these are decent money makers and you certainly don't lose money unless you are just firing indiscriminately.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389997610.0,"I think a lot of people are answering using the logic that there is still a good chance that the child will be high functioning, so they would keep it. I would not approach it with the same optimism. My cousin is at the extremely low end of the spectrum and cannot take care of himself at almost 40 years old. He can only speak and understand a few words, he cannot read, he has very few ways to connect with others or for others to connect with him. From the outside he appears to have severe brain damage, not autism. As much as my aunt loves him, it has taken a huge toll on her. Not only that, but when she dies, what next? I could try to take care of him, but I would have to put my entire life on hold to do so, and I wouldn't even know how to start. I feel like the best option is to put him in a home and check on him regularly. 

Yes, it feels selfish, but I don't think people appreciate what a huge sacrifice it is to care for a severely handicapped person until you see first hand what their families go through. It is a 24/7 responsibility for the rest of your life. I have spent a fair amount of time with mentally handicapped people of different types before and I consider myself to be pretty good at working with them, but it's completely different from the burden of being their parents.

I know that having a child always comes with the risk that it will be different in some way that makes it difficult. There is no way around that reality. But I do feel like I would use the tools in my power to reduce the possibility of a major disability in any way I can. So I would not focus on the probability that ASD will not be so bad, I would focus on the chance it would be severe and the fact that by aborting I would be able to prevent that. "

So yeah you need to find something or somewhere to meet people. It's really not difficult. There must be *something* you're interested in? Sports, books, films? Then there'll be clubs related to them. Find them. Join them. Or gigs, or sports events, or something. Girls will more than likely be there.

Friends of friends? Try and get yourself invited to parties. Meet girls there, get their numbers, meet up. Go out, etc.

Go out to public places. As I said, parks...somewhere open. Where people won't be scared to be approached. It's creepy to approach someone at a mall because they're minding their own shit doing their own thing. But at a park it's really easy.

All the canon I've seen hints at but never explicitly states centralized power systems. I'm going go back through the Battlefleet Gothic book if I can find it. Your point on redundancy is well taken, but several large reactors should accomplish the same goal.  

As for the weapon systems, the majority of Imperial ships still use projectile weapons. Torpedoes and macrocannons are the most common weapons, although there are dedicated lance vessels which would support your point as well.  

Additionally, a lot of Imperial tech is assbackwards if you accept canon (given that it's an RPG, you can do whatever the hell you want). If you look at, for instance, the FW Landraider stuff, the lascannons are powered by an independent battery banks. They might be rechargable from the engines."

rampant_elephant,pics,1389998216.0,"Here's the closest reference I've been able to find: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_price#Jewish_tradition

The ""bride price"" is referred to [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketubah#History) as the ""mohar"", which seems to be translated to just ""dowry"" in [English](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+34%3A12&amp;version=KJV) editions of the bible. There is [one guy](http://www.utoronto.ca/wjudaism/contemporary/articles/rape_of_dinah_genesis_34.htm) who uses the word ""mohar"" there, but I've not managed to work out which translation he is using. The context in Genesis 34:12 is of a man paying a woman's father as part of marriage, which is a bit different to the [current meaning of a dowry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry).

It seems like a ""mohar"" was just something people would know about at the time, rather than something which has to be explained by the bible."

&gt; SWMH - Is a map, history and culture overhaul attempting to replicate the medieval world. It adds numerous new provinces, cultures, and titles

&gt; ARKOpack armoiries - Improves the coats of arms in the game, both the dynastic ones and the titular ones

&gt; ARKOpack interface - Gives the game's interface a completely new look

&gt; Project Balance - Improves historical plausibility through numerous tweaks. Attempts to preserve the vanilla experience while still making the game more interesting to play

&gt; NBRT+ - Improves the graphics of the game's map, giving a cleaner, more appealing look

&gt; VIET Traits - Adds a number of congenital traits to the game. Also included in the Project Balance module

&gt; VIET Events - Adds a large number of flavor events to the game, making for a more interesting experience

&gt; VIET Immersion - Aims to improve the depth and detail of the various cultures and religions, making each of them stand out and make for more unique gameplay. Unfortunately not yet compatible with the SWMH module

viceywicey,AskMen,1389998375.0,"When my grandmother died (she raised me, not my parents.  They were in the picture but my morals and values are all her), I cried twice during the entire thing.  Once when I said goodbye at the hospital.  Once more when I gave her eulogy.  Every other time I was stone-faced.

For me, it was less an issue of whether or not I was conditioned to hiding negative emotion or that society/culture says that men don't cry.  I cry when I need to.  For me, it was that I knew regardless of her passing that shit needed to be done.  Funeral arrangements need to be made.  Phone calls to her close friends need to be placed.  It's weird.  The preparations and everything are distractions from the event despite the fact that they're all being made for the loved one lost.  I often times find that there's no space to grieve because we're being relied upon by our family and friends to be strong, to be emotionally stable, and to be psychologically bedrock.  I still don't know how I did it, calling someone she's known for 40+ years and listening to the woman say, ""I'll see her soon and tell her you've turned out amazing.""  How do you even process that knowing that the woman on the other side needs you to be strong for her?

At least in my experience, most of the guys I know who have been through the loss of a loved one will grieve when faced with the moment, which is good.  What's dangerous is every other moment they distract themselves from their emotions and the gravity of what has passed and then mistake the numbness or the detachment they feel as acceptance of the event when in truth it is simple a coping mechanism.

I can't speak for your husband and no amount of sorry for you or him will do the situation any good.  In terms of how to help him through, all I can advise is keep a watchful eye.  Don't push the topic or try to draw out how he feels unnaturally.  Most guys will answer as he does, ""I'm okay"", ""I'm hanging in there"", etc.  It's the moments where he's alone, where he's run out of things to distract himself that you watch for.  99% of the time a man is ""fine"".  Then there's the 1% where an ambulance drives by and you remember and you can't help but pull over to side to weep.  That 1% is what you watch for.

You are a product of your time and culture. You are not looking to absolve that. You are a looking to make the most of it. Academic history *should* be a product of its time and place because that's how it makes sense.

As it stands, we send a truckload to the LCBO DC every couple weeks depending on the PO's. They distribute them across the province. Many of the craft beer you find in the LCBO is contract brewed by other breweries who can handle the load for this exact reason. There would certainly be less craft beer from the contract brewer side if they suddenly all had to buy a few trucks and deal with distribution."

But my sister tried to kill herself last year and was picked on horribly as a kid, threw screaming tantrums, and was emotionally and physically abusive to me for a very long time.  My boyfriend gets so anxious in crowds that I have to hold his hand and lead him somewhere else, and he came home crying from work the other day because he didn't know how to respond to a slightly awkward situation with a coworker.  I know he also got into physical fights in school as a kid because he was awkward and got picked on.

I don't think this is true, today's moderate will be tomorrow's extremist. For instance, Nixon proposed a very similar healthcare reform as today's ""Obama Care"", he also signed into law an amendment that allowed disabled people to use medicare. These might be considered right wing or moderate views at the time, but today it's considered an extremely leftist view.

Certainly present day we're seeing the least amount of laws being passed in history, not to mention the steep rise in the amount of fillibusters. However I don't think the problem is with extremist views, I think it has to do with the amount of money being spent in politics, which right now is also at an all time high (lobbying, superpacs, etc)."

The difference between ISAF and USA is - USA is on a combat operation and act after that, ISAF is on a peackeeping/rebuilding mission and *try* to act after that. There has been progress in many areas, the standard of living has increased, girls are goingto school, areas are blooming. I will use Gereshk. Before the battlegroup was stationed in gereshk, it was a lifeless city, people could go out side, no dance, no dragons(as in those you fly with in the wind), no trading as such. There was huge firefights and the city was a ghost of it self. BUt when the taleban was driven out of the populated areas, life began to start up, shopkeepers were given money to buy and build up a store, a bazar started up again, a radio reparing shop was build to sell and repare radios. That is the impact the stationed forces has had. Clean water has been drilled from the underground, hospitals has been build.


But all of this is soon to be thrown away, when we leave the country and betray a population of people that actually wanted to have peace and be freed from the Taleban regime...

Yes there was casualties, it has been some of the most brutal fightings in a long time and it has been damaging, but progress has been made for the populace."

josebolt,conspiratard,1389998966.0,"I think that a thorough history lesson would make those claims (prior to the Snowden leaks) rather unsurprising. Controversial domestic spying (and policies) has been around for long time. I think the difference is that times and circumstances are much different. Looking back at the Cold War the government could do some rather terrible things in the fight against communism with little or no opposition from the people, such as domestic spying. Even before then they spied on telegraph communications for gods sake. But who wants to protect commies right? In the 1930s the US deported thousands of mexican-American citizens because, well basically fuck brown people they are not ""real Americans"" anyways. Of course there was also the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during WW2, no one seemed to think there was a problem with that because fuck the japs right?. 

Our government, historically, has done some of the very fucked up things that some conspiracy theorist worry about. I think the big difference is that they often had the support of the people or at least their indifference (particularly with minority groups). So when we say this is nothing new its not an exaggeration. But a spy agency that spies is hardly a conspiracy. That does not excuse their abuse of power though. "

I'm still applying my own mind to this question, and even this trivial result is subject to being wrong.  And if the demon *is* affecting my mind, he could be merely making me *think* he couldn't be affecting this.

Thanks a lot for your response. Did you mean ""I **can't** think without existing""? I understand the Cartesian reasoning, but I'm not sure I understand how it's possible to doubt the existence of your own mind meaningfully.

If they moved their melee from the majority of their empire for combat, you can pretty much do this with impunity - fast movers can heal up faster than cities can knock them down if you are smart about it.

If you can dip them into unhappiness, you cause them a negative modifier on combat. And if you remove strategic resources - say, Iron for Swordsmen - they'll get an additional modifier for that.

Additionally, you can mess up their resupply by taking up roads. A single hex or two can delay troops by turns.

Don't bottle into anything with a screw cap unless you are able to cork it. And don't cork anything that's only meant to take a crown cap, because most of those bottles are not meant to withstand taking a cork and can rupture. Sparkling wine bottles are an exception.

Aging depends on how it's bottled. If you use agglomerate corks, you probably need to drink up before three years. If you used the best corks available you have many years. Oxygen seal crown caps and zorks work for many years as well. Temperature and light are also obviously a concern, but under the right conditions, mead can last a long time."

They sent her a check and said to deposit it and then Western Union a large portion of it out and she could keep the rest. So she did. And spent the money (I think on bills?). By the time the second one came, she'd told her dad about the job and he told her it was obviously a scam. Check came in, she didn't cash it, but then realized she was about to be out something like $1200 so she withdrew everything she had from her bank account to move it into another and then had to slowly pay the bank back for the overdraw.

When my friend told me about this, I couldn't believe it. I was sorta living with them at the time and said that if I'd known that was happening I would have told the sister not to be retarded and to not cash it, but she wanted to believe so much that she had some good thing here, as she'd been looking for a new job for some time and money was tight."

The next day, one guy stopped by, looked around at what i did and left, then I got an email saying ""We have pulled the fiber optics into your server room, blah blah."" So not only they added another 3 days behind on schedule, I had to do it for them, and let them take credit for it. Whatever."

But, they had badass lore writers who set the foundation for their company in the 80s/90s and acquired one of the biggest model makers in the western market so they decided they get to run rampant screwing it's players and not listening to what they want or need willy-nilly.

What metro features would you like to use that don't have an analogous mode in desktop? and yes, metro is a walled garden like the apple app store, but it's not stopping you from using traditional installers.

There are merits and detriments to walled garden app stores, and I'm not a fan, but looking at microsofts track history for needing to pander to enterprise, there's only the slimmest chance they would ever lock down desktop.

CaspianX2,AskReddit,1389999582.0,"It's a restaurant that was featured on the TV show Gorden Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares run by a husband-wife team. Their attitudes and practices were so atrocious that it's the only restaurant Gorden Ramsay has ever given up on in the many years he's been doing the show.

They would routinely take tips left for the wait staff and keep it for themselves, they would yell at and eject customers who complained about food, they responded to online criticism by slinging insults and acting alarmingly immature, and have maintained that their unpopularity is due to some sort of covert plot against them.

In the time since the episode, it's been uncovered that the one bright spot for the restaurant, their cakes, is likely due to the fact that they buy others' cakes and pass them off as their own. One Redditor even made a very persuasive case that the restaurant only existed as a front for a money-laundering operation, and the owners genuinely don't care (or perhaps even prefer) if customers abandon their establishment.

And of course there's the fact that the restaurant's two owners are just generally unlikeable people. In fact, since the episode aired, many have gone to the restaurant out of sheer morbid curiosity to see just how bad it is.

So yeah, it's pretty bad."

Yes, it is withing Monsanto's right to get the seeds returned to them, but that is not where they stopped. They say that they own a particular roundup ready gene in a given plant. The nature of pollen is that it spreads on the wind, and it caries genes with it. Many farmers that did not buy Monsanto seeds have Monsanto genes blow in on the wind, pollinate and contaminate their crop. Monsanto also demands that the contaminated crop be returned. This has the effect that farmers unfortunate enough to be down wind of a farm that is using Monsanto is also subject to the rules that Monsanto makes. I find this unfair."

This is 200 years in the future. At the end of the series, it is pretty clear that to survive and prosper our Valvalvrians have to create an empire.

200 years later this empire is revealed to be a galactic empire.

Meaning that they conquered the world, and then went on to expand into the galaxy.

The aliens were called Lifeform 252 or some rando number. Meaning that in the 200 years of expansion, they have fought/encountered 250+ species while expanding the empire.

The aliens try to sneak into their vault, because supposedly the source of their power is their.

But ~~*human garbage-chan*~~ new immortal space vampire Prime Minister-chan is all like, ""You came for our powerz. But lol, our power is the memories of our friends. So we made them into statuez. lol You got owned.""

And so, the pilots that lose memories are able to continue fighting even 200 years later because they are doing it for their friends who passed away. The vault *is* their remembrance vigil for Haruto and company.

And it ends by the Valvaves now asking if people love humanity instead of if they want to abandon humanity.

Mind you, I don't feel the ending was amazing.

But it's a lot better than people give it credit for."

Even the ""Hey, you fucking suck at that character."" is easily ignored when you have some experience with the game. But when you are just starting out, assuming his friend is in the low levels, those comments can really turn someone off of an experience if they are just going to get ripped on all game. Especially if it is spammed in the chat window during the match, or a plethora of other dickhead tactics. 

 Now, I am not one for the ""Let's hold each others hands and I will tell you how special you are"" way of things, but why can't ones methods be different? Instead of ""You should uninstall this game and never play it again you are so bad"" why not change your method, after all you are in casual.

piratelibrarian,infp,1390000268.0,"Mum of a 16 year old daughter and an 18 year old son. I think I'm a challenging parent as I've always pushed them to be very independent (often more than they'd like, but they see the value in it and it's always been age and maturity level appropriate) and almost always refuse to be their entertainer. I was a crap toy provider as I couldn't really relate to regular toys and opted instead to keep them well-supplied with ""adult tools"" - things like proper sketchbooks and instruments and stuff to foster their creativity. They certainly didn't suffer for it as they're spoiled on all sides of the family, but I got a lot of ""but I wanted Mr. Blinky-Noisy-Vroom-Vroom like the other kids!!!"" I also insisted on a lot of alone time and would often give myself timeouts when I needed alone time/was in a crap mood. 

A lot of my parenting decisions came from selfish places, but I don't really regret them as I've got two pretty self-sufficient and self-aware budding adults now, but I have often wished that I had some kind of maternal instinct that many parents seem to have and allow them to put their sprogs first. Funnily enough, both my sprogs are ENFPs. It's a wonder we're all still alive o.O"

akua420,LSD,1390000367.0,"The trip will last 12-16 hours, so don't plan on sleeping for that long.  I took it at 7 and was still sorta seeing flashes of stuff in the sky the next morning at about 11-12 when I was driving home, plus you will be tired and foggy minded so you won't want to do anything the next day. 

Also, since you will be alone, I'd let a friend know you're doing them in case you want to talk to somebody to let all the amazing ideas and thoughts out.  This may save you from calling the wrong person and they will think you have gone crazy.  

The best way to take it is to put it under your tongue, and keep it there as long as possible.  You can swallow but it takes a lot longer to hit you because it does take a while, a lot longer then shrooms.  Also if you're trying to decide how much to take, take the higher dose, for sure.  I'm an avid fan of shrooms (done more then I could possibly count, I grew up in a town that was 1 1/2 away from where they grew huge amounts and we could get 1/4 ounce for $20) and I love hallucinogens.  And LSD blew my mind it was so amazing.  To me, its like all the best things about shroooms but more intense and not 'emotional' if that makes sense.   

If you start having 'bad' thoughts (or thoughts you aren't prepared do deal with) change your scenery.  For instance the light, the movie, the music… it will change the direction of your trip.  

When you are starting to come down, smoke a joint and it will peak all over again.   

Also be prepared for a reawakening after you're done your trip.  It'll open your mind and make you realize things about yourself that you may have been previously unaware or, or stressed about.  For me, its like comparing your mind to a 2D and 3D movie to put it in words.  Its the same movie, but when its in 3D you notice different things that were always there you just didn't realize it or their importance. 

Also, it would be amazing if you would watch fear and loathing for me on it, and explain the experience.  Ive always wanted to but never have and think it would be amazing.    Sorry for the long winded response.  Have fun!!!!  Wish I was there, hahaha."

Flightless_Kiwi,AskReddit,1390000377.0,"Quotes from the South Carolina Declaration of Secession: 

&gt; ... an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the institution of slavery, has led to a disregard of their obligations, ...

&gt; but the current of anti-slavery feeling has led her more recently to enact laws which render inoperative the remedies provided by her own law and by the laws of Congress. In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals; and the States of Ohio and Iowa have refused to surrender to justice fugitives charged with murder, and with inciting servile insurrection in the State of Virginia.

&gt; States have assume the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domestic institutions; and have denied the rights of property established in fifteen of the States and recognized by the Constitution; they have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery; they have permitted open establishment among them of societies, whose avowed object is to disturb the peace and to eloign the property of the citizens of other States.

From the Declaration of Secession from Mississippi: (this one contains the words ""slave"" and ""slavery"" 7 times and contains ""right,"" ""rights,"" or ""Constitution"" a total of only 4 times.)

This is the *second sentence* in the document:

&gt;Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery-- the greatest material interest of the world.

I do not by any means wish to paint the north as ""great humanitarians."" Wars are very rarely fought for humanitarian reasons. But the specific aspect of sovereignty that made this internal disagreement a matter of war and not simply a political battle is that slavery was the foundation of the Southern economy and it was being threatened."

These are a form of bondage device that restrict the genitals. Just asking for a ""bondage device"" would be too generic. And asking for a bondage device that restricts access to male genitals so that he can't masturbate or have sex"" is unwieldy, especially when there is already a term for this - ""chastity device"". 

The only reason they asked for ""chastity devices"" instead of ""chastity belts"" is that most male chastity devices take the form of a ring you put the penis and scrotum through, and a cage that covers/contains the penis, which locks onto the ring. 

There are other forms of male chastity device, such as things that work more like the medieval-style chastity belt, and spiked rings that hinge closed around the penis making erections very very painful. "

keakealani,rpg,1390000503.0,"I don't know that I fully agree with that assessment. Sure, D&amp;D is less strictly designed toward roleplaying than WoD or other settings, but I think it has a lot to offer and it's obviously that D&amp;D and its various iterations are extremely popular amongst roleplayers. And yes, it can be crunchy at times, but I think it's actually people like you who swear it off as *only* crunch that causes it to devolve into the type of players that /u/rob7030 is talking about. It's possible to have a healthy balance between a crunch-intensive game and a roleplaying/storytelling game; clearly, players like /u/rob7030 and others are looking for that even within the D&amp;D-style framework, so I think it's narrow-minded to believe that it's simply D&amp;D (and similar game mechanics) that causes players not to roleplay or develop storytelling. It's part of it, sure. But it also has a lot to do with the individual player's goals and attitudes, which isn't strictly about mechanics. 

Edit: Also, I don't strictly believe that the number of rolls is relevant to the quality of roleplaying, anyway. Some people can roleplay terribly (or not at all) with hardly any rolling, while others can roleplay extremely well even while rolling constantly. If anything, it primarily has to do with the skill and interest of the player, not the number or type of dice that they are or aren't rolling. "

As for your laundry basket, there is no need for it to be tipped out on the ground unless there is no where to do a thorough search.  Things should be put back as best as they were before the search but sometimes cars and houses are just so full of shit and rubbish that it doesn't matter.

TheWaIrus,television,1390000680.0,"Ob the whole I think Parks and Rec is the better show, and is overall probably my favorite comedy in the last 5-6 years. At it's very best, Community is, I think, funnier and certainly more ambitious, and I think season 2 is one of the greatest seasons of comedy ever made and probably better than any season of Parks and Rec. But on the whole Parks and Rec is a much more consistently great show, with better characters and much better developed storylines that you care more about, which leads in to my main problem with Community. As much as I love it at its best, I never cared much about the fates of the main characters at all, and I thought it fundamentally failed to sell many of its more sentimental moments (though i know this is something a lot of people would disagree with me on).

In regards to which of them starts out stronger, Parks and Rec definitely has a shaky first season but it's only 6 episodes long and season 2 doesn't take long until it becomes really great. Community is very good already in its first season but it's more towards the later half of season 1 that it really shows what it can do, so I'd say both shows take about as long to become great."

slockley,AskReddit,1390000846.0,"&gt; Turning the junior cop into a witness does not make the ""meteor"" hypothesis any more believable.

I totally disagree.  While this theory may seem less likely than the other two, the cops are compelled to ask around, to see if anyone else witnessed the meteor.  As of the witness testimony, it is among the 3 best theories in existence.

&gt;""maybe it's that serial killer we've been trying to catch.""
&gt; Now the junior cop's contribution seems perfectly reasonable -- arguably more so than the witnesses'.

This analogy inserts additional information that affects the probability of likely scenarios.  I'm not saying that witnesses are necessarily the only source of information available to us.  But I maintain that witnesses provide evidence that must be examined, which was the point of the analogy.

I think you're saying that the serial killer is more likely than the meteor theory.  Perhaps.  I'm saying that both the meteor and the serial killer theories are each more likely than the set of infinite possibilities.  And that the task of coming up with a most likely suspect is possible, and limited to those with evidence, witness or otherwise.

That said, can you give an example of a belief system that lacks witnesses?  The only one that pops to my mind is antitheism, and Pascal's wager casts that out of the conversation for other reasons.

&gt; 1. The religion was, in fact, directly inspired by its god
&gt; . Something else -- someone made it up, or was deluded, or someone misinterpreted something someone else said, or a different god tricked the religion's followers
&gt; You are claiming that 1. is more likely than 2.

I don't think I have made that claim in this discussion.  I do hold that view, but I consider it irrelevant to the topic at hand.  Option 2 lies outside the boundaries set by Pascal's Wager.

&gt; I repeat myself: Just because an explanation fits the facts, that does not make it any more likely than any other explanation.

I think you mean that an explanation that fits the facts isn't more likely than any other explanation *that fits the facts.*  Obviously it's more likely than an explanation that does not fit the facts, right?

&gt; A theory that fits the facts but does not make predictions is worthless, because for any given phenomenon, there are infinitely many explanations which agree with the facts.

This is fantastic in the context of testable predictions.  But to my knowledge, Science is silent on religion.  The claim that God exists does not make testable predictions, nor does the claim that God does not exist.  I don't see how the criterion of falsifiability is relevant here."

When those behind the experiment came up to the resolution to his ""paradox"" Schrodinger, Einstein and other were swayed.

The double slit experiment shows the duality of light; light acts as a particle AND a wave simultaneously. Related experiments have shown that simple observations can CHANGE the result of your experiment. 

I just read QED by Richard Feynman. It is a pretty easy read for someone with a basic physics background. In it, he explains that the double slit experiment ALSO shows that light takes every possible path between the source and end point, but then, largely takes the most direct path! "

&gt; So basically, anyone who doesn't identify as male or female is delusional?

Now you're getting it! Yes that is what I'm saying.

&gt;So if someone came to the realisation that they were genderqueer, it would all be a lie and their personal feelings about their gender should be dismissed?

You can't come to the realization that you're genderqueer because there's no such thing. Their feelings shouldn't be dismissed. Maybe they should see a therapist or seek a healthy outlet for their creative confusion.

2) What point am I missing? You must not be explaining it very well if I'm still not understanding it. Why don't you want to answer the question? Is it maybe because there is no evidence to support alternative genders being anything other than a made up 'special snowflake' attribute? I do have an idea what I'm talking about. Not sure why you keep throwing that around along with calling me ignorant and such. I've done my research.

3) What lack of knowledge do I have? Hint: Not having the same beliefs as you doesn't mean I'm ignorant. 

&gt;tears your argument apart

Hahahahahaha you keep thinking that bud.

You still haven't answered my question! Man you must have selective reading. Here I'll post it for the third time: 

&gt;They can call me edgy for not believing in gender identity, but I can't call them edgy or else I'm ignorant? So if I call them edgy that makes me ignorant. If they call me edgy what does that make them?

If you could actually answer it this time that would be awesome.

&gt;Someone who believed in genderqueer identities isn't being ""edgy"".

That's subjective. Edgy is a buzzword anyways, it hardly has any meaning.

But not believing in your crazy identities is edgy? I have no idea where you even came up with that."

[Plants respire all the time](http://bioenergy.asu.edu/photosyn/books/Lambers-PlantRes-Bk.html) to carry out basic life processes that require energy. On a net level, it's true that plants put oxygen into the air through photosynthesis, but only because the plant photosynthesizes more than it respires.

What scarabeetle asserted was that, since the plant isn't photosynthesizing at night, but it is still living and respiring, the plant requires oxygen from its environment in order to be able to carry out metabolic processes. I'm not a plant biologist but it seems sound.

TotallyUnqualified,AskMen,1390001298.0,"I would date a single mother, and have, but I do not have kids. It is important that she have good answers when it comes to the kid(s) and the relationship. 


For example: who is watching your kids when we are hanging out and getting to know each other? How often is this possible, and why? 

Taking care of your kids is (or should be) a person's priority, so the manner in which she manages that is important. Does she plan ahead and know who needs to be where and when? Or does she send a text at the last minute and say ""hey sorry I can't do what I said I would do because of the kid"" etc. That is a card she can play whenever she likes, but doing so very often will set off alarms.

I also wouldn't want her feeling guilty or making me feel guilty when we spend time alone together. If you feel guilty, then you probably should be spending more time with your kids or not leaving them with lousy babysitters, etc. If you are a single mom, you need to fucking own it and bring some stability to the situation. I am not going to dictate how the three (or more) of us balance our relationships, I'm simply going to express my interest in spending time with you and (sometimes) your kid.

skfoto,askcarsales,1390001322.0,"The continuously variable transmission (CVT) does not shift gears like a normal transmission. It smoothly allows the engine to rev up or down depending on whether you need power or fuel economy. Basically you put your foot down on the gas it revs up, ease off and it revs down. Pros are that they usually are more fuel efficient than a normal automatic (see next paragraph below) and that they provide constant access to the maximum power of the engine- for example merging on to the highway, the engine revs at the point where it makes peak horsepower. Cons are that they have a vague or slushy feel, almost like the transmission is slipping, and that the car is often slow from a standing start because it takes it a second to rev up to where it makes all its power. Very noticeable when pulling out into fast moving traffic from a parking lot. They also tend to make the engine have a loud droning sound due to it always wanting to rev up high when you hit the gas.

In the Compass the normal automatic is actually slightly better on gas mileage than the CVT (by 1 mpg). The normal 6 speed automatic in the 2014 feels a lot more peppy and quiets the engine down quite a bit. The car feels more responsive- when you hit the gas, it goes- compared to the slow rev up to higher RPM's that you get when you hit the gas with the CVT.

In a nutshell there are no advantages for choosing a Compass with a CVT and several advantages for choosing one with the conventional transmission. But if you're just looking for a point a to point b kind of car and don't care about the quirks of the CVT, then save yourself some money and go for the used one. Ideally try test driving them both."

The Jewish revolts aside, Hadrian's reign was mostly a time of consolidation.

&gt;It's so big a difference that it has decided which creatures went extinct and which creatures still roam around today. 

I was referring to human traits there, actually, and I don't think that particular human genetic traits have a very large impact on how likely you are to survive in modern, developed countries. You are correct in saying that different traits can mean life and death (leading to evolution). 

&gt;things social darwinists advocate

Many social darwinists advocate a complete removal of any sort of social safety net, and that the government not do anything about issues like poverty and other social or economic imbalances. They also believed that environment had a small to largely nonexistant impact on how you turned out as a person, which is not supported by science. Social Darwinism and eugenics were popular ideas in the late 1800s to early 1900s. 


About traits being objectively better:
There are some traits that are objectively better than others. I suppose I should have addressed those. An example in humans are adaptations people who historically lived at high altitudes have. For example, [Tibetans have lots of adaptations to high altitude, like increased lung capacity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_adaptation_in_humans#Tibetans). If we all had that, we'd all be able to live at really high altitudes much more comfortably. 

Living things evolve based on who has the most surviving kids. Who's fittest and superior depends entirely on the environment the species lives in. Generally, things evolve to be ""good enough"" instead of better and better. If a mutation creates an objectively better trait, it won't necessarily spread if the organism that has that trait doesn't have lots of surviving offspring (relative to those without the trait). Dominance of beneficial mutations does occur, but  I do not think it is relevant to humans, because what alleles you have doesn't determine how well you do in life/society. "

No matter how hard you work, it will always be easier for a rich person to make a million dollars than a poor or middle class person, because they can use the leverage that their capital gives them to extract the surplus of others. That's not hard work and motivation, that's just having the deck stacked in their favor. I'm not saying that a person cannot move from worker to owner, but if private owners are allowed to do as they please with their capital, absent all restrictions, than they can easily pick the next generation of winners too. They chose to give it to their own children, those children didn't do shit, but they still retain most of the wealth accrued by someone else's work. And there is the birth of a feudal aristocracy. "

Kerbal Space Program has a steep learning curve at the start but once you get the hang of it you can design and launch some truly impressive stuff, or just do what you want with what you have. It is a lot of fun and the non linear career mode is interesting. If you enjoy design you will love this game but if you get into it you will likely enjoy it anyway as I did.

Project Zomboid is interesting. I would advise checking a demo before you buy. It is zombie survival with a heavy emphasis on survival. This involves sneaking around zombies (it is very easy to get swarmed), trying to grow crops and literally build a base that is impregnable to zombies. Really it strikes me more as a survival game with zombies being used to ramp up the tension. I do like it, there was a particularily memorable moment for me where I used my shotgun to kill a single zombie only to be overwhelmed by literally several hundred as I accidentally alerted the largest horde on the map to my presence. I simply ran out of ammo. Finally the death system is quite interesting as you respawn as someone in the exact same town moments after your original character died, allowing you to keep your hard one base and items (if you can recover them)."

LydiasBits,AskReddit,1390001574.0,"Only once and never considered doing it again. It was '85 and I was in HS. I was driving my dad's Porsche and was parking with my BF on the backside of the local regional airport. It was about 10PM and my top was off and jeans unbuttoned. His jeans were down and we were sucking face with hands everywhere although we realized that it was extremely uncomfortable because of the center console. 

Car was on listening to music. University cop (who patrolled the airport) came up behind us and turned his lights on. All that flashed through my head was ""no way am I going to get caught in this situation"". So I slammed it in gear and did a quick 180 to head back out from the airport to the county road. Saw him coming up behind but maybe 50 yards back as I was heading away from town. Got the car up to about 135 and he was following but not keeping up. 

I knew the area well having grown up in the area. So, just past a small hill but before the next hill there was a smaller county road that wound down to the river and connected to a couple of other roads that came out into an average neighborhood. Never saw the cop again but I drove my BF home which was 15 miles outside of town in a different direction and then proceeded to go to one of my best friends house that was in his neighborhood and called my parents to tell them that I was spending the night there. 

I hoped, wished, and prayed that he didn't get my license plate number and after a couple of hours of hanging with my friend, we hit the hay. 

Woke up next day and drove home. Parked in the garage. Went in as though nothing happened. 

Nothing ever came of it beyond my dad asking why the car was so dusty and me having to wash it. My excuse was the neighborhood my friend lived in had only gravel roads, which was true, and it hadn't rained in some time, also true. 

Thanked my lucky stars after that. 

Somewhat anticlimactic, I'm sure. 

TL,DR:  topless parking in dad's Porsche with BF, high speed drive away with cop trying to catch up, a few county roads later got away as far as I know. "

OP, /u/dafaddfad,  I would suggest you look into renting a room with someone on craigslist, or some other co-housing opportunity.  youll find a lot of college kids around your age and you can all relate to the struggle together.  this isnt just your problem, it's everyone's.  and maybe they can vicariously motivate you to keep going toward your personal goals no matter the fear that holds you back.  you could look into helpx.net, which gives you room and board for helping out people with mostly farm-type work but there's some really interesting stuff and many places take workers year round.  a change of scenery might be really good for you, anyway, and you'd learn a lot of skills while being active.  lots of good food, too.  

the current economy is horrible.  be mad at it, understand that you are not struggling alone.  but don't let it take your humanity, your strength, your perseverance.  this struggle does not have to last your lifetime.  look into meditation and creative ways to better your life.  you just became an adult, why throw your life away before you get the chance to experience it because you can't find work and might-- might what?  be homeless for a short period of time?  is that really worth killing yourself over?

there is free mental health therapy in most places if you financially qualify, and a lot of people do.  you likely do.  just google something like ""free/cheap/low cost mental health clinic"" or find the local low cost clinic for health, it tends to have a dental, mental, and other related clinics listed.  maybe you can talk these things out.  or like i said, meditation might help you sort it out on your own.  i dont think its a very practical position to cut your candle short just because you dont like how it burns during a rough patch.  try to remind yourself of these different perspectives to self talk your way past the fear and loneliness.  good luck.

I was expected by doctors to have trouble getting pregnant, if able to do so again at all, got pregnant within 4 months. It ended up being better than I'd ever dreamed and my life is pretty much amazing now and our entire family is better for it. My son is exact opposite of my daughter and while I love her very much, she is a very challenging and exhausting child. My son is mellow, pleasant, easy and happy all the time. He makes my daughter happy and there's a part of me that is glad I'm getting to experience parenting with a child that doesn't have the extra challenges of behavioral problems, and at the same time that helps me feel more relaxed and happier, which in turn has actually made me a BETTER mother to my daughter.

We really never, ever know what the ""right"" choice is. I was scared I'd made the wrong choice to have another child literally up to the day we were in pre-op for my son's c-section.

**Why does this surprise you? The parent thing, yes, that surprises me, but not from the 14 year old's point. Kids and teenagers are curious. I'm not, however, condoning that type of relationship because a 14 year old is still a minor, regardless of who they're interested in.**

&gt; Where are the parents- in the case of sibling incest- when all this is happening? Sounds like these kids are given way to much alone time by their parents.

**I can only speak for myself and my brother in regards to this. Yet I can liken this to a teenager seeing a boyfriend or girlfriend that their parent forbids them to see. People are crafty, especially hormonally-driven teenagers.**

**For us, it wasn't odd that we spent time together because our parents knew how close we were. Even prior to sex, we were close. So us wanting to go camping or go to the beach by ourselves or with friends, wasn't unusual. Our parents both worked over the summer, full time. We either didn't, or were only part-time, giving us plenty of opportunities.**

***Edit:*** Our parents also stopped checking in on us at night around the time that we turned 13 and they weren't afraid we'd asphyxiate on our drool or smother ourselves under the covers. 

&gt; How lonely must they be for them to be only to find intimacy because it happens to be under their roof?

**I actually find this extremely offensive, but whatever. It's not about being lonely. Both myself and my brother have had relationships outside of the one we have together. We've had experience. We weren't each others ""firsts"" for anything except anal sex. We weren't lonely.**

&gt; Why go to such extents to explore sexuality e.g games of 'you show me yours' and 'truth or dare'? Do half these people not know google or don't think to just ask a parent?

**Uhh... how about because it's weirder to ask your parent something about sex than it is to ask your sibling who you're open and close with? I mean, really? Granted, this seems more aimed at younger people rather than teenagers and the only ""you show me yours/I'll show you mine"" stories I've heard have taken place when the participants were, guestimating, under 10 or so.**

**So to answer that, curiosity and seeing something online isn't the same as seeing it in person.**

&gt; Where are all the ramifications? You don't just move on from something like that.

**No, you don't. Though it depends on the two people involved in the relationship. I'd say that non-incestuous couples have just as rough of break-ups as an incestuous couple does.**

&gt; What if some horny 13 year old boy is reading this stuff, and because of the lack of discernment, gets convinced that it's okay to make sexual advancements on his sister?

**It's not my job. Simple as that. I do my part in moderating to make sure it's 18+ here and I remove stories that aren't or don't fit that criteria, but it's not my job to post billboards on this subreddit telling people not to do something. It's 18+ only, that's all there is to it.**

**It's the same as porn. You can apply this question directly to something like, ""What if a 13 year old sees this video of rape being roleplayed and decides to try it out on someone?"" It's not my job to police who *views* this subreddit because I have no way of determining that. It's the internet. I keep the kiddie porn posts off here and that's all I can do.**

&gt; How do I create a nexus? I'm not sure if it's part of the mod but it's like a small floating platform with a few portals and people suggest that's the place to keep all your books.

A nexus isn't apart of any mod, just a title given to an area that allows teleportation to many different places. The portals come from creating a frame from Mystcraft crystals and a book receptacle. The receptacle is iSided so you can pipe in books for different locations. Once a book is in the portal will open to that destination. How you set up the system to both store and call individual books on demand is a matter of preference and taste.

Classics don't really do it for me. I like my books to have sci-fi components with characters that have well defined characteristics and a storyline that forces characters into action (as opposed to just slice of life/relationship/life lesson type books). Most books that are considered classics are usually some allegory about some human condition. That's fine, but I don't really care to be taught a lesson when I'm reading for fun. I recently finished the hunger games series and the main character was so conflicted internally that by the end I just wanted her to be killed and the series to be over.

Anyone have any suggestions for books with strong characters who aren't conflicted, with a story that puts them in challenging situations that don't force them to act against character? Preferably sci-fi, not too into fantasy or period settings.

I usually climb from this culvert onto a series of plateaus. Each plateaus is an island made of other culverts and bridges which extend up 15-20 feet into the sky. On the plateaus there are blocky, boxy structures, also made of cement, emanating strong yellow light. I can feel the activity in the buildings in my dream, but for some reason I never want to approach the structures. I usually skirt various structures for a while, noticing their sharp angles, hidden compartments, and every now and then I see a shadow inside or hear what sounds like a quiet conversation. 

At this point, the dream get's a strange James Bond-y vibe to it. I'm sneaking now, and obviously trying to avoid detection. I see or hear some sort of commotion in one of the towers, and I make my way as close as I can in the culvert towards the structure. Then, without warning, I find myself trying to escape. There are no signs that I'm being followed or pursued except for a huge sense of urgency to get away from this place. On the outer edges of this block ""town"" is a huge chain link fence. I usually either try to crawl underneath it or over it. 

From then on I usually wake up. It's like an odd dream playground for me, and I've had this dream on and off for a multitude of years, sometimes with year intervals in between. The most uncanny thing about it is the similar location, and the ridiculously yellow light being cast off by these buildings. Think mountain dew yellow, super vibrant and oddly powerful. 





My worst nightmare involved sleep paralysis. I woke up in my bed at home, unable to move, but with a faint howling in my ears. We live in a forested area, so it's not uncommon to hear coyotes or even a few bears or mountain lions every now and then. This howling that I heard, however, was from a wolf. It was long and drawn out, and it had a distortion to it that was almost painful to listen to. As I lay paralyzed, the howling suddenly started to get louder and louder, until I could hear heavy, clumping footsteps approaching my room. 
I was drenched in sweat at this point, as I realized this wolf was coming for me. I *knew* it was coming for me. I had this dread inside myself that was shouting for me to run, to escape, to do anything but lay there.

But the sleep paralysis had taken it's hold, and I was helpless to move. I could only move my eyes to look out the window or near the door. 

As the footsteps drew nearer and nearer, I heard the ragged breath of the beast. The breath sounded distorted and quick, like it hurt for the animal to draw in a large lungful of air. But it howled again, regardless of the pain it seemed to inflict on itself, and this time this howl was right outside my door. It sent chills down my spine, and my feeble attempt at communicating with my muscles was met with the infuriating stillness of my limbs. 

*Scratch.* The beast had begun to claw at the door, breathing more and more quickly as the door shook from the sheer weight and slice of it's paws. In a last ditch attempt to save myself and escape the terror that now shook my core, I screamed and yelled for help, for anything to come and take me from this place. 

My own screaming seemed to wake the rest of my brain up, and the wolf, the pawing, and the terror seemed to disappear almost instantly. I stayed up for a few more hours that night just to make sure I wasn't going to lapse back into that dream. Sometimes when I'm home I still think of that wolf, however, and how it would have looked. I can't stand coyote howls to this day. 

Tl;dr: Dreams of cement and weirdly lit buildings, and a wolf almost had me for a midnight snack. "

porridge_thief,AskWomen,1390002086.0,"It may help to pay attention to tags when you're buying jeans--certain material blends will stretch a lot while others won't, which could be why you will be different sizes even if you are working within the same brand. The wash of the jean also plays a role in choosing a size because lighter washes tend to stretch more than darker due to the process used to get their colour. It is also good to read description tags on pants (if they have any) because some brands will have different sort of fits e.g. curvy, semi curvy, etc. to better suit the needs of the customer. 

Tl;dr **Pay attention to tags when  you're purchasing jeans, especially the ones that mention the materials used--it affects your size when buying!**

I missed class the entire next week, not because I wasn't physically able to get there but because I had been so concussed that I couldn't pay attention to anything and focus. I couldn't even study at home as I had zero attention span due to the fogginess in my head. Every teacher understood except one. I showed up my first day back which happened to be test day, a test that I couldn't have studied for even if I tried. I presented a doctor's note and the prof said that she doesn't do makeups, no matter the case, since it said in the syllabus. I showed her my cut up face, arms and feet but she wouldn't budge stating again that she wouldn't do makeups under any condition. I got a D on the test but a C in the class. I missed the final too, which was written on the syllabus but she apparently changed it one of the days I was gone. When I found her in her office asking ""WTF"" about the final, I told her I did what she said earlier and I checked my syllabus. She said I should have paid more attention in class. What a bitch!

Hi there TrollHabitsDieHard,
I recognise parts of this from a male perspective as some of the things I've dealt with. My impression is that you're putting way too much emphasis on what others do around you. It feels as if you've lost the confidence in yourself to find that prince charming.

As I told someone else before, in my personal opinion I believe that a woman is most noticed for the confidence she radiates. If you feel good about yourself as person, and you're able to show that to the world without becoming arrogant then that will trigger quite a few people. You do not have to rush in relationships. Take your time but be honest with the guy. If you're not able to go fast and you need to take your time because of how you feel, do not be afraid to tell them. A good guy worth fighting for, will respect that and support you.

Just because you're a little desensitized to the dating rituals, doesn't mean you can't manage. Take small steps, and you'll definitely succeed. But it starts with believing in yourself :)"

I described a game in which there's an easy, binary tradeoff where the defense ""chooses"" to distribute intensity of defense in paint versus intensity of defense of mid-range jumpers, sort of similar to [mixed-strategies optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_(game_theory) in game theory. It's intuitive and appropriate enough to describe the ball-defender's philosophy in a standard pick-and-roll and that's why I used it. Your criticism that ""[t]hat would assume that the defense isn't better off forcing many low percentage looks with the risk that some high percentage shots happen"" is actually accounted for in it, but again the game doesn't reflect the dynamism of basketball.

My point was that you'd still rather yield open elbow shots than drives to the rim if those open elbow shots are still a less per-possession efficient shot even if they inflate the elbow FG%."

There was a time when up to a third of Milwaukee was foreign-born German (that doesn't even include offspring of German people or people who speak German) but that all changed after the World Wars. If not for them, I suspect we'd be the German equivalent to New Orleans.

Obviously right now having paid online would be stupid because barely anyone would pay nintendo for such a lack luster online infrastructure.

Two kids could easily lay down in a pile of leaves playing ""hide from cars"" or some stupid shit and get killed.  I constantly worry about it driving down the side streets in my neighborhood and have made remarks to my girlfriend on several occasions about my worry that there could be kids in the leaf piles and why I specifically never drive through leaves even though it looks appealing and fun."

-Stable and independent

-Activities/dates both with the kid(s) and as a couple; easing into things and allowing all parties to feel each other out is ideal IMO

-Vested personal interest in me for me, not just as a ""replacement daddy""

-my interest declines in proportion to the number of children from different fathers

-expectations of me to immediately fill a ""fatherly role""; if it becomes an LTR we can discuss what roles I should take in their life (if on good terms with the actual father, I don't need to try and fill that role)

I would date a woman with a child, but I can not be a part of that child's life until we are getting serious. I don't want to meet your child at all, so that I'm not just another man coming in and out of their life. Once things get to a bf-gf level, then I will meet your child, with the complete understanding that I'm not just dating you, I'm dating both of you. No matter how much a woman says that her kid has a dad, or that her kid doesn't need a dad, or that she's not looking for a dad, if I'm in a romantic relationship with you, I fill a dad-like position, whether you like it or not. Every adult influences a child, and the closer the adult is the more they will influence the child.
  
Also, if your kid is an asshole, and you're not being a good mom to deal with it, then that's a deal breaker. Once again, I'm dating you and your kid. You could be awesome, but if your kid sucks, and you suck as a parent, then I'm out.
  
Overall, I will date a single mom, but they have to understand that the commitment to them is now way bigger with a child.

Its not like its one of the most common heatsinks and grounds in the world. Its not like cars use the exact same mechanism for a universal ground. Making something *look* good is not the same as making it good. The major point is theres no way that apple actually *designed* that fan, and if they did it would be one of the most stupid wastes of time they could ever have undertaken. They are not a cooling fan company, I have a friend who is convinced they did the entire thing from scratch by hand and came out over all the other companies who hire engineers to actually do that job. Why? Because thats what they said in the commercial promo video. 

Lets forget for a second that the macbook air isnt even the thinnest laptop ever made, even the same year it first came out it wasnt. Lets ignore the fact that they place all kinds of proprietary ports which dont even have peripherals that exist in order to sell you over priced adapters for them, the design of which they change with every model for no reason. Seriously, have you tried buying a macbook to vga adapter, theres like 10 different ones and none of them have a monitor or projector associated with them which means no matter what you have to buy the adapter. In the mean time the thinner option actually includes a real vga port... hurr durr... apple is the best. "

Maybe you thrill to it even more now, in the sense that appertizers generally skew towards the more sinful, and frankly it's probably more effort not to eat it if it winds up on your plate for some reason.

But, really, if the chef's done his job right, you already had enough at the time, and as fun as it is to break the rules, a lot of the time the tastes don't really hold right because what was fun at the time seems really tired and shallow now, and the charm of having to explain Lothar of the Hill People again fades in a manner disproportional to the fun.

The life time of the Feminists having no accountability and blaming imagined misogyny / sexism / Patriarchy for all their failings brings on this huge delusion that they live in .

She was upset that some male  doctor she had her eye on went and married a teacher ten years younger !!?? and could not understand why he would marry below him salary wise  you only marry above.

I think the way basketball does it is perfect. And it really is the reason that I think you need a 16 team playoff. Anytime I say that I get downvoted to hell, but in my opinion the only alternative is that you need to have the basketball model, where every conference champion gets a chance to play for the national title. Otherwise, stop pretending they're the same division. To me the only two solutions are either to cut off the big five or six conferences into their own division like this article says, or have a 16  team playoff where every conference champion gets in.

Niceness doesn't matter, everyone is nice in some way; only confidence matters. The thing is, she did like me for a while, but she didn't want to take it further because she didn't want a relationship at all. I suppose I got quite jealous of that other guy before that.

Even when she didn't like me, she was really close to me and we talked a lot, her avoiding me in real life just sorta made me upset.When she did end up liking me, we talked even more everyday. And now, she went off to a national service camp, it's been 2 weeks out of 3 months and she said she didn't like me anymore even though she said she was sure she would. I guess she was just confused about her feelings or something, but I'd hoped a lot for something more.

A small part of me thinks that this is what it's always gonna be like, that even if someone does like me, it won't last, so maybe that part of trp is true, even though the rest of me is calling bullshit. 

Also, like I said before, I don't care about getting a girlfriend, it's just that girl I really connected with and had feelings for, and she liked me too for a short while, but that went away so quickly that I can't help but feel a little betrayed/lied to.

It has a fair amount of crazies, and tends to pat itself on the back *way* too much. Things like ""Fuck War"" always get tons of upvotes, but often very little is done. 

You dont have to look back too far to see how inept the UN is. Look at the genocide in the Balkans (or countless other examples). The UN pretty much just issued a strongly worded directive saying ""genocide is bad.""

The EU also failed to act despite being told by the US to take care of problems in its own back yard. After things like the [Srebrenica massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre) happened it was not the UN or the EU that did anything to stop it (despite being in Europe). It was technically a NATO mission, but it was largely the US that began strikes against Milošević's targets. 

At least for me, making self-congratulatory statements and saying popular things does not mean an organization has integrity. It takes far more than that.

blackpony04,Buffalo,1390003580.0,"Definitely see the Falls and I personally think they're the best at night because they're lit up and if you're there on a Friday you can see fireworks at 10PM. However, the Falls are only about a 15 minute ride from your hotel so you can easily visit it twice (day and night). On the American side you may only spend a couple hours there (be sure to go to Goat Island to see the Horseshoe Falls too) but Canada can be a real time suck as there's something to do for everyone and you could easily spend both days doing stuff there. The Canadian side has the best view and is worth the visit but you'll need either a full passport or a passport card to cross the border. Our weather is phenomenal from spring through fall with July being the best summer month (it doesn't go above 85) but my favorite month is October as WNY is unbelievably gorgeous in fall and as a bonus you'll miss all of the tourists. Be sure to take the Maid of the Mist tour at the Falls and you can access it from either country (it's a few bucks cheaper on the US side and you get a little extra in that you can walk up close to the side of the American Falls). Canada is far more expensive than the US side so be prepared if you go there. Stay out of the City of Niagara Falls, NY itself (don't worry, you basically bypass it to get to the State Park) as it's kind of a shit hole. Nothing dangerous per se but after you see the beauty of the actual Falls seeing the rotting city can be kind of a bummer. The good news is the area around the park is decent and includes a casino if you're into it and that has some really good restaurants. If you're a hiker you can hit the Whirlpool Park just a mile north of the American Falls and walk down along the Niagara River to the Whirlpool (the trail is really crummy but I find it quite the adventure and I too am in my 40s and in ""good"" health-quotes because I'm a fat ass). If you're at all into history travel 10 miles farther north to Old Fort Niagara in Youngstown NY (where I live!) which dates back to 1726 and is a treat for only a 2 hour investment (and is only 30 minutes from your hotel). 

As for Buffalo, food is something they do really well and a great restaurant in close proximity to the Adams Mark is Pearl Street Brewery as they have awesome food, a ton of beer choices, and a cool atmosphere. I disagree with those that find Anchor Bar overrated but honestly like most food it's all subjective and you'll probably be happy with wings from anyone in Buffalo (and I do like Pearl Street's too). If you're into baseball the Buffalo Bisons minor league team has an awesome stadium to catch a game in and is in walking distance of your hotel too. Also, take a drive to the lakefront for the Naval Park if you're at all interested in history and you can tour a destroyer and a submarine tied up right there.

Honestly, if you plan your trip right you shouldn't have any problem seeing everything there is to see in the Buffalo-Niagara region and feel like you got your money's worth. And if you can't tell, I love it here! I lived in the Chicago Area for 25 years (after being raised here in NY) and moved back in ate 2010 and have done more here in the past 3 years than I did in the previous 20 in Illinois!

2. It was clear that Torres aimed for the head, Sobotka's low stance can give Muzzin the benefit of the doubt.

3. Torres had a suspension history, Muzzin did not.

4. Torres injured the opponent, Muzzin did not.

I'll admit that Muzzin deserves a short suspension for it and StL should have gotten a 5 minute PP for the hit, but there's no way it is worth a double digit suspension."

Of course, the vapor is very cold, and the foot would be rapidly cooled until it no longer causes such rapid expansion, at which point it would freeze even faster... but the point is, if you accidentally stepped into a bucket of liquid nitrogen, you would easily have time to pull it out before any serious damage is done.

sometimesyoufly,NorthCarolina,1390003922.0,"My husband works in Rocky Mount for 8 more days and then he's free. We're moving out of the state this summer, partially because of Rocky Mount/Nash county's dismal education system, and partially because the job market is wretched. *edited to add: I meant to note that my husband enlisted in the army, in his 30s, for the quick path out of this area after spending 3 years trying to find work in other areas both in NC and out.

In the 2.5 years I've lived in Nash county (we live outside of Rocky Mount because utility costs are far too steep) my husband has been attacked twice leaving work (he's lived in the area since almost 15 years and says it has happened many times over the years.) Once an attempted robbery by 4 people and thankfully the police had already been called so they pulled into the parking lot as they attacked. The previous event was three drunk men followed him from his store after he closed, angry with him because he told them not to park in a handicap parking space. They caught up to him at a stop light, got out of their car and tried to attack him. Before I came along, when he was either a teen or early-20-something he and another employee who worked at the theater were robbed of the night's deposit at gunpoint. He works with a guy who was shot in a drive-by but the man refused to press charges because he was afraid of potential retaliation against his family. He once worked with the woman who was shot by her boyfriend while at work at Westridge Grill. We do NOT want our children growing up in this area. 

I don't really have anything nice to offer the discussion to give a better impression of the area, unfortunately. I didn't believe the rumors before I lived here. As a teen I would drive from two counties away to shop in Rocky Mount. I would come to the Rocky Mount theater because it was the largest in the area. Now?

I know there are worse places in this nation, but this is the worst place I've ever lived. I do like the library and farmer's market, but I always feel nervous going there.

HorrendousRex,AskReddit,1390004396.0,"I love to tell my Edinburgh travel story. I was 18 and on my own and in huge culture shock. I honestly can't explain my thought process. I was looking for some sort of game shop I had heard of, but accidentally got off the train at a suburb. My experience of Edinburgh was walking around the streets of some random residential suburb with a backpack for a few hours.

I walked in to a pub to ask directions and for the first and only time in my life actually experienced an entire room go silent. I stumbled around with my extremely not scottish accent for a while trying to ask where the game shop was. Someone finally responded with something along the lines of 'Mate, how fucking lost are ye?' and I just turned around and left for the train.

Worst part was, this was all done in a single day starting an ending in London. As in, a six hour train ride I think? It's entirely possible I wasn't even actually *in* Edinburgh. I do have a memory of seeing some sort of castle on a raised place (a small hill) though...

Itachi0970,AskReddit,1390004406.0,"I feel that even when regarding the ones close to them, such as the family, it shouldn't be wrong because they find it unacceptable. Back to my previous example, the same could be said for the parents of a gay person, if they're heavily conservative and don't like that their child is gay. As for the individuals themselves, it's their choice who they choose to have a relationship with, so as long as they are both consenting adults, I feel that it should be acceptable.

For the second part, I believe that quote is referring to future society, and not your personal descendants. I find this point relevant because even if incestuous relationships were socially permissible, they would still occur very rarely. So, the resulting descendants of such relationships would not have a large bearing on society in the future.

However, if one were to take the quote to apply to simply their own descendants, then most relationships that lead to procreation would be wrong, because if one wants their child to be as genetically superior as possible, they should seek the partner with the best physical traits. However, most relationships are created out of mutual attraction, and not just physical. I feel I'm rambling now, but the point I am attempting to make is that a relationship should not be determined by what could go wrong with their children, but by the feelings of the individuals involved when making the relationship."

time2change76,Catholicism,1390004440.0,"C. S. Lewis has a very insightful quote on masturbation:

""For me, the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite, which in lawful use leads the individual out of himself to complete and correct his own personality in that of another and finally, in children or even grandchildren and turns it back, sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary partners. This harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no real woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides, he is always adored and always the perfect lover. No demand is made on his selfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself. And it is not only the faculty of love, which is thus sterilized and forced back on itself, but also the faculty of the imagination.

The true exercise of imagination in my view is: (a) to help us to understand other people and, (b) to respond to, in some of us, to produce art. But, it also has a bad use: to provide for us, in shadowy form, a substitute for virtues, successes, distinctions, etc., which ought to be sought outside in the real world -- such as picturing all I'd do if I were rich, instead of earning and saving.

Masturbation involves this abuse of imagination in erotic matters which, I think, bad in itself, and thereby encourages a similar abuse of it in all spheres. After all, almost (all of) the main work of life is to come out of ourselves, out of the little dark prison we are born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison."""

I hateeeeeddddd it, but I'd decided to read it because I'm a completionist and I *wanted* to read The Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I was getting into the movies. I don't even think I got to the second book...reading Tolkien is hell. I so desperately want to get into it, too. I feel like Tolkien was to fantasy as Freud was to modern psychology: they both laid out critical foundations for their ""fields"" but Tolkien sucked at writing skill while Freud sucked at himself being a good scientist.

That being said, George R. R. Martin is a *fantastic* writer. There's never any sense that ""oh, this is a main character, nothing bad could happen to them"". There are plenty of things that happen where you'd think they were important clues or red herrings but they're simply happening because life isn't perfectly laid out like a book. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that he often defies convention of storytelling and a lot of the boredom from predictability is blown up. Sometimes it drags and sometimes you have to read characters you hate (who you'll wind up loving later most of the time) but it's absolutely a good read.

Whether Nintendo likes it or not, they need to face reality: gaming is multiplayer, online centric experience, and if they want to appeal to that crow, they need to step up.

Nintendo hit the nail on the head with the Wii... they were sold out forever, pretty much everyone had one, and Microsoft and Sony scrambled to come up with motion controls for themselves. But as time wore on, they soon began to lose their appeal for a lot of people as both Microsoft and Sony continued to develop and improve, and Nintendo just sort of lingered, clinging onto to what was fleeting: motion controls, and sadly, that's a lot of people really saw in the Wii, including developers: not nearly as good system performance and little to offer in terms of promising gameplay mechanics and online features... the stuff that developers look for when it comes to developing or porting games, and marketing them towards their ideal consumers: gamers, not soccer moms.

Rolten,malefashionadvice,1390004849.0,"The reason we do this dates back to when King Edward VII ruled the United Kingdom and the British Dominions.

Back then, King Edward was known for his fondness of clothes and was seen as a clothing icon. As is stereotypical, this British king was kind of a big guy. For this reason he preferred to leave the bottom button open: he just needed a little room for his belly. Being the icon that he was back then, other men promptly followed suit (ha). 

I once however heard a more entertaining version, and this is one in which the bottom button actually popped off his dinner jacket while he was having a social night. A very important part of etiquette is that you do your best to never embarrass someone else at a party, especially if it is your host or your guest! So guess what all his guests did upon noticing his popped button? They immediately unbuttoned their own bottom buttons as well. Now that's being a gentleman!

Nowadays we still continue this tradition. It might no longer be necessary to have a bottom button there, but some things don't have to change. The idea that you don't button your bottom button is so deeply ingrained into our culture that suits are even made to accommodate it. Any well-made suit will look a lot worse if you button the bottom button. 

---

Fun fact: A similar story of etiquette comes from my country's former queen, princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, who recently passed on the title of monarch to her son. She was having a very nice dinner with her guest -an African prince- when she noticed that he actually picked up his finger bowl and drank from it. Dear god that's embarrassing! Of course, being a well-raised lady, she immediately picked up her own bowl and proceeded to do the same. Her guest probably didn't realize his mistake until years later. "

The main one is a massive pain in the ass for people who travel a lot and own multiple credit cards, do you know how hard it is to use one card in another country? It sounds simple but its not, you have to get through to a support representative and have them authorize the fucking account. I don't have the time to wait, I had a few hours to kill in the hotel and then I have to meet a client. After I meet the client its straight to bed and then on again to the next place, maybe by the time I land in the next location the support team would of gotten back to me. Time is gone so its pointless getting authorized.

Steam is really awkward for people who don't live in the US, who move around and who own more than one credit card. Steam is great but all I want to fucking do is play SW:KOTOR 1, thats all I fucking want.

I sound bitter because I'm literally going through this right now for what feels like the 100th time, I just want to play KOTOR. Why is Steam acting like an over protective parent?

People don't like to recognize Vitor as they can't identify with his seemingly immature, macho, preachy lifestyle and actions but a few things he does have is durability, drive and loads of heart. He's had the drive to keep going even **AFTER** having his sister kidnapped and brutally murdered - mind you he didn't know for a long time her actual fate. During the time he didn't know what happened is when he lost fights, then he sits at #2 to Anderson for a long time until his title shot to be taken away by a fucking stomp to the face within a few minutes of the first round. Steroids may (probably) have shot his T production and now he needs TRT just to hit normal levels - and he's *still* going at it.

Luriker,AskReddit,1390005167.0,"SKB Cases incorporated. 

I bought a Large Tuba case from them that arrived on July 1st 2013.  On August 27th, the second day of my Fall semester (I'm a Tuba performance major) one of the wheels stripped, making wheeling it impractical.  Mind you, this case weighs 45 pounds, on top of the 40+ pound Tuba inside, and is about five feet long, give or take.  So I resorted to deadlifting it around campus and using the free bus system.  I had them ship me a replacement wheel under warranty.  When it arrived, there was a package that was ripped up, and instructions, but no wheel, no casing, and no bolts.  They had tried putting it into a fucking mailing envelope that got eaten by the USPS.  I called them and informed them, and they sent me a replacement.  I then found out, after taking the old wheel off, that the only way to get the wheel in was to rip up the fabric and padding that keeps my tuba safe and install it from the inside.  How fucking practical.  I postponed it until Thanksgiving break when I could go for a full week without needing to protect my tuba inside of a case.  A few weeks later, the handle broke clean off my case.  I called for a replacement case at this time, and wound up wheeling the tuba case at a 45 degree angle on the one remaining wheel.  I got an estimate of two months to ship out the tuba case, but they had insisted I send the first one back.  I put on my big boy pants and argued my way into them dismissing that policy.  I received my case after only a full month, and at this point the one wheel had broken.  I had taken to hugging the entire fucking case with my body to walk it.  I then had to custom fit the new case, and figure out how to ship back the old one.  SKB declined to pay for the return shipping themselves.  I got a quote of $270 to ship the original case back.

I found a solution to the shipping problem that I can't state here, but long story short, I've been through hell with these guys, with minimal accomodations.  I look forward to the day I can pay a luggage company to custom fit a case, rather than deal with SKB and their warranty (as the wheels are the same shoddy make, I have no doubt they'll give out on this case too)."

But we had other issues too where he would choose other things (a lot of the times gaming but not just that) over me, and I felt very marginalized.   Most guys, I have noticed, get more interested in following gaming news rather than actually gaming as they get older.  The case is similar with me, and I am quite happy with that.

steve496,49ers,1390005291.0,"It depends on what you assume about who's staying and who's leaving.

I would not assume that we're going to hold on to more than 2 of the following 5 players:

* Anquan Boldin
* Donte Whitner
* Frank Gore
* Carlos Rogers
* Tarell Brown

Each will cost ~$5 million a year or so to retain, and we just don't have the money for all of them; the only exception is that if Gore and Rogers *both* take pay cuts we might be able to squeeze in a third.

* If Whitner leaves, we need a Safety.
* If Rogers or Brown leaves, we need a CB.  If both leave, we *urgently* need a CB.
* We need a WR.  If Boldin leaves, we *urgently* need a WR.

With that in mind:

1) If we have any urgent needs (per the above), I'd trade up to try to get a can't-miss prospect for that position - but I would not trade future picks, and would in practice limit the package to our 1st + KC 2nd + Ten 3rd, and I'd only give up that much for Sammy Watkins (if he should happen to fall to the low teens).  In general, this is a deep enough class that I think we can be conservative about trading up and only do it if we can get a good deal on a good player.

2) Otherwise, draft BPA among the players available at those positions.  My ranking of potential 1st round players looks something like the following: Sammy Watkins, Mike Evans, Darqueze Dennard, Justin Gilbert, Marqise Lee, HaHa Clinton-Dix, Jason Verrett, Jordan Matthews, Kelvin Benjamin, Odell Beckham Jr.  Your mileage may vary.

3) Not sure how many rounds the mock draft is going, but if the answer is more than 1: after WR, CB, and (if necessary) S are addressed, I think our 2nd tier of needs is a backup QB and a developmental offensive lineman, preferably a G or C.  Next year I think we start Kilgore or Looney at C, but the year after Kilgore, Iupati, and Snyder are all free agents so we need to start working on replacements.

4) Best player available is always a good strategy - if someone really talented falls for whatever reason there aren't too many positions where we couldn't use additional talent (RB being the only one that comes to mind).  We don't have any immediate needs at TE or in the defensive front 7, but it never hurts to build for the future."

jonivaio,NoFap,1390005420.0,"&gt; I haven't used porn in over a year.

I doubt that you remember the feeling of negative effects that a person might experience from watching porn. Even in moderation a person might not be self aware enough to notice any effects at all. 
I'm an alcoholic. For long time I was convinced that I'm doing my drinking in moderation. I'm 30 years old and I can count on one hand how many times I was ""clear"" for more than a month.

Even if I drink only once a month (few beers) - I'm still ""a fish in water"". Because ONLY AFTER ABOUT 48 DAYS my body, my system can really detoxify, to notice and feel THE REAL difference. I think there was studies about this, but I remember this from my own experience.
 
I don't believe that porn in moderation isn't harmful if you don't feel any negative effects straight away, like it would be from meth. Personally I can notice and physically feel some effects when watching porn. I know that it has an aftereffect on my mental well being. And in the process itself I've noticed how something is happening in my stomach, like my body is reacting by getting ready for mating and is scraping/gathering necessary ""ingredients"" for ""the discharge"". This false drill alone is a negative effect in my book."

sevenbridge,AskMen,1390005450.0,"In addition to what others have said I think encouraging more mixed gender social interaction would be helpful. Like games where you have to communicate 1:1 with someone.

Although like others have said at those ages I wasn't *really* interested in girls. By 12-13 I was though, and I think at that age it would help boys (and girls) to be given genuine, realistic, advice about how the world works. Obviously what different people see as 'genuine and realistic' varies significantly, but I'd say stuff like:

* You can't force someone to be attracted to you (give up and move on)
* Don't wait for a girl to make the first move (they'll rarely make it)
* If you like someone let them know sooner rather than later
* Meet as many people as you can
* Get interesting hobbies (*not* games)
* Muscles and fitness are attractive (both long distance runner and lumberjack, to different people)
* Anyone can get fit
* Being confident is attractive
* Being funny is attractive

etc

**But** I think it's difficult to give advice to 12-13 year olds on how to act. By the time we've grown up and learnt enough to give useful advice to our peers we've forgotten what it's truly like to be 12 years old at the start of secondary school; we're fundamentally unable to relate to them."
