It's a funnel process. If the first step in the process is less than 2%, than I would have a very narrow set of options towards getting details or even being considered for an interview. I think you're being very optimistic, which is good for morale, but not so good for planning and strategy."

It's just that in the grand scheme of things, this is pretty much a non-issue.

reginaidiotarum,weeabootales,1389716323.0,"I can't tell tone if I'm reading, changes in the rhythm of the speech as well as word placement means that the subtitles don't quite match up with the tone of the person speaking. Also, don't act like skimping out on a VA budget is purely a west thing, I've heard a few dubs that are improved by having better casted VAs characters.

I think my favorite dub is the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Crispin Freeman is no stranger to the gruff tough guys. He's Shizou from Durarara, the guy that throws vending machines, he's Togusa from Ghost in the Shell, he's Alucard in Hellsing. His voice is like a sweet honey liquor, his deadpan response swing with a natural cadence that reveals the emotion that his character so desperately tries to hide. It's hard not to hear the glee he has when talking about his childhood aspirations, not in his shift of tone, but in the subtle way he places more speed and energy into it. I have a hard time reading the novels and not hearing his voice, and I don't mind one bit. And he acts across from Christina Vee.

Chris Vee brings all of her extraordinary energy into playing the part of the extremely energetic Haruhi Suzumiya. She's also a fan of the source material. She aspires to not only respect the character that she plays as, but also respect the voice actress she's dubbing over. Like the original voice actress, Christina Vee sang both of the songs from the festival and proceeded to play the a different character in a different show because there are a few voice actress allusions to this character.

Also, in Japanese, adult Goku is played by the same voice actress as kid Goku. If you aren't able to be swayed by personal pronouns, the femininity behind this character made entirely out of muscles is rather distracting.

My point here isn't to gush over this specific dub, but to point out that quality of both original source and the dub are relative to the company and individuals that do the dubs."

Some men get access to more than 1 woman but this is mostly only because of male deaths in gathering resources/testing the environment, but I am sure that the highest status guys get the ""best"" ones as well as the excess.

These natural incentives/consequences as well as how hard it is to survive in a state of nature are likely what balance it out. Although, obviously living such a life almost all of your time is spent on mere survival concerns.

The whole situation really upset some of the other members. Some of them quit over it. Most people will say to watch 'Until the Light Takes Us' but I think 'Pure Fucking Mayhem' does a much better job of not only providing insight, but also shows how fucked up that whole situation/band is and was. Eventually Euronymous was killed by Varg Vikernes(the man behind Burzum). If you want to know more about the church burnings and ""satanism""(anyone into metal just laughed) then 'Until the Light Takes Us' is a better way to go. Regardless, the early years of black metal are nothing short of fucked up, but honestly, it is fascinating. Listening to Varg Vikernes is the epitome of ""you're not wrong, you're just an asshole"".

Then there are guys like me who can have ""dry"" orgasms.  This is when I cum, but I know for certain there is no semen present.  Through focus and breathing, I can make myself ""cum"" - it looks and feels like a regular orgasm but there is no semen.  I have all the outward appearances, faster thrusting, deeper penetration, cock twitching - all that.  But no semen.  AND, I stay hard to keep going.  But when I have a ""wet"" orgasm in which I ejaculate, my cock immediately goes limp. 

So it happens.  I'm not sure which camp your boyfriend is in, but do know he's having an ""orgasm"" and it feels good to him.  Don't worry too much about whether or not he's ejaculating, just enjoy the sexual connection and moments they bring.

Marriage rates are dropping but more importantly, women are waiting longer to get married. Notice that your graph says **15**-44.  Fewer people are getting married at fifteen anymore. And that's probably a good thing let's be honest. "
axv136,videos,1389717131.0,"Let me have the downvotes, but I completely disagree with your statement. What you are hoping for is a hate crime and its wrong. Yes no one in their right mind agrees with them and yes their religion isnt recognized by some countries and their ""religion literally only preaches hate"", but just because we dont agree with their message doesn't mean that anyone should be killed over it. The christians did not agree with the muslims and there millions of people killed over it (see holy wars over jerusalem). The nazi's didnt agree with the jew etc. Similarly, I dont agree with the opinion to ban/not recognize the WBC as a religious organization. Its a slippery slope. If the government stops recognizing one religion as illegitimate what's stopping them from banning islam or hinduism or some other religion that is not liked by the people in power?

TL;DR: WBC has more nuts than circus elephant but getting rid of elephants is bad?

Covers and art are treated differently.

Edit: Fan art falls under derivative property. You're creating new ideas based on another's previous work. If it resembles the previous work too much you could get sued. In this case OP's art is very identical and even admits to it being a drawing of Valve's intellectual property.

However, Valve and many companies don't pursue legal action because of the negative PR it would induce.

Also, when they do go to court they split pennies--so any financial gain is illegal. It doesn't matter if you're ""making a living"" or selling art for $1. They can come after you.

Fan art solely belongs to the owner. However, if the artist wants to distribute that art for money they still technically owe the original artist/company that created the Juggernaut image."

urfouy,AskWomen,1389717236.0,"One of my mentees is a young, rail-thin, gorgeous girl who really likes to post pictures of herself wearing almost nothing on Facebook.

After attending a festival and posting a ton of revealing pictures, I'm guessing that a friend or family member had a talk with her.  She came in and told me that while it seems like a good idea to post the pictures now, she can't possibly guess how she'll feel in the future.  This seemed to make a lot of sense to her.

Insurance is very very rarely settled by presenting an equivalent car, even though it's technically an option, that's why God invented checks and money. But I also wouldn't expect to get a 2014 ZL1 for zero out-of-pocket. 

What I think happened, and this is clearly speculation, is that when the car was wrecked the dealership owner started shitting himself over how he was going to handle this, talking about ""not my fault"" and ""here's another car"" like a panicked teenager. Then when all this shit blew up his insurance agent called and said ""What are you doing, this is all covered by your business insurance"" *et voila* the Hoopers have a check for the market value of the car. 

Then Mr Hooper said ""well, that worked out OK, even though it took a while, can you help me finding a 2014"" knowing that the dealer is not going to risk any more face by jacking up the price.

But this is biggest fallacy: that vegans are ""equating"" things by using comparisons or analogies.  Comparison in no way equals equivalency.  But it is mainly ridiculous that we feel a need to put things on moral ""scale"" at all.  Why can't we say it is just all *really, really* bad?  

Was American slavery worse than the holocaust?  Is the child sex trade worse than Ariel Castro's house?  Is a dozen violent rapes worse than one murder?  It is ridiculous and pointless to try to create a hierarchy of suffering.  

Yes, by definition, what is happening to the animals *is* a holocaust, it doesn't need to be ranked with the holocaust on the Jews.  Even if that was 1,000,000x worse, the horrors of modern animal abuse are incalculable.  

Animals are not just being mutilated, tortured and killed for our *pleasure* but they are being *bred* to do so.   We are continually creating more animals to torture.  It is not just billions, it is *billions every single year.*  The actual descendants of the Nazi holocaust realize this and have done something about it.

The animals are also not being treated like animals.  They are being treated like beings who cannot, suffer, think or feel.  They are being treated like beings who have no right to their own bodies or even their lives.

Hope that helps. I don't know if quitting would help overall dream quality in the long run, since I haven't been able to test that, since the longest I've gone pot free over the past 5 or 6 years is like a little over a month."

It freaked both of us out.  We ended up changing the rules after that.  No means no."
Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389717399.0,"There is a private academy here in town and they also run a preschool. 

I had applied to expand my Early Childhood Education and as luck would have it they wanted to interview me. They were willing to give me benefits and full time and great pay. Plus, they were desperate to have a male among the ranks that had experience and education in ECE and so it looked like I had a good shot at getting the job. 

Note: I was in high school and studying ECE at the local vocational school. 

Anyways, before that all happened I happened to apply for a babysitting gig and got offered that job. 

MY parents convinced me that because i was still in school I should take the babysitting job as they thought it'd be easier to do school and babysitting. Plus, she was a struggling single mother who was desperate for help. 

So I thought I'd do the noble thing, turned down the interview and took the babysitting gig thinking I knew what I was getting myself into. 

Let me tell you folks, no good deed goes unpunished. 

I ended up working 50 hours a week at what amounted to $2 an hour (hundred dollars a week), had to take care of two boys, one had severe AD/HD and usually went un-medicated. The other one was the eldest and their father was Eastern European and was treated like a God for being his first born male. I dreaded getting the boys back when they spent a weekend with their father because the eldest would come home with a superiority complex and I had to calm down the youngest one as he usually came home depressed. 

OH and the mom got increasingly pissed off at me because I didn't have my license yet, even though I was only 16 going on 17. IT was too hard for my family to have one vehicle to share between 3 people. She kept getting mad because she'd have to drive me home. 

I quit after the 10 y/o chased the 8 y/o around the house with a butchers knife, and as luck would have it, it was too late for me to reapply to the Pre -School. 

SO yeah, my biggest regret was giving up a possible career to try and do something noble thinking karma would pay off in the end. It didn't. I ended up getting screwed.

I think it's easy to distinguish between the two; I don't think that maleness or whiteness are traits that are the defining features of human rights. In my mind, the prerequisites for having human rights include: being a human, and having the beginnings of a distinct nervous system.

I also want to have a mid-PhD pregnancy, and we both agree that we want to be married before we have kids.

We also feel like ""waiting to get married"" is a bit of a silly concept.  Our relationship is what it is, and avoiding some paperwork isn't going to make it worse or better.

BurningLed,DotA2,1389717686.0,"I agree that BoT are strong, but phase boots are cheaper, provide damage, and synergize with your Q and E well. Yes, you do get free base trips, but Ember's got a small enough mana pool that exercising rune control and/or bottlecrowing covers you well enough. I don't disagree and think it's avalid build option, but I'm saying that I don't find them necessary to rush, though I like them later in the game to split push with.

I generally get a 3-0-2-1 build; maxing W sounds great because level 4 W is, as you said, amazing - 6s cooldown on a 120 bonus damage attack on everyone? Sweet! 

The issue is that the cooldown makes the skill ass except for Q combos at every level that isn't 4, and even then it's outclasses by having more levels in your other skills. If you're in a sidelane, I agree with maxing it first because it gives you some effectiveness, when you can't get a level advantage (i.e. aren't mid) and allows you to stay safe. But if you're mid, the damage you get from Q and E (and don't forget, your Q also goes from 14 to 8s cd, and scales hugely in damage at 3+4) is tons more effective for ganking. The W is great in teamfights, because of exactly what you describe -- you can't engage on the enemy right in their face, you'll get blown up. But when ganking, the amount of damage and lockdown you get from 3 points in your Q and the way you can prevent enemies from turning it around with the damage block on your E is much too strong. 3x ult, Q, E is 660 magic damage at level 6, just from the ult damage and the Q+E DoT, after autoattacks and whatever your teammates provide, they will usually die before they get a chance to move. You're not risking anything when you get 500 EHP for most early game burst, and 3 seconds is usually enough time to kill them, or get close enough that you can just follow with phase + E, and maybe an autoattack or two for the kill.

slockley,AskReddit,1389717749.0,"&gt; There is no such thing as a ""known"" god.

I think I've communicated definitions poorly.  By ""known"" or ""revealed,"" I describe a god-candidate for which a religion exists.  That is, if a god exists, and if that god has a religion based on him, then it is because that god has revealed himself to mankind.  So, by this definition, known god-candidates necessarily exist, as the subjects of their respective religions.

You said:

&gt; Because, in actual fact, we don't ""know"" anything about any god

and

&gt; Just because an explanation fits the facts, that does not make it any more likely than any other explanation.

We do know about known god-candidates, though.  And while there is a theoretical, unknown, polar-opposite to each of these known god-candidates, to suggest the anti-candidates are as likely to exist as the candidates strikes me as doubtful.

An analogy: Imagine the police show up to a murder scene.  Dead body on the ground, no physical evidence to be found to suggest who delivered the fatal blow to this man's head.  No weapon, no prints or DNA.  However, there are 2 witnesses.  One says she saw George Smith kill the man, plain as day.  The next says the murderer was a woman with a red coat.  One of the junior cops suggests ""maybe a meteor struck the man and dissipated.""

Now there are 3 theories, each different from the other.  Each is internally consistent.  And an infinite number of alternate possibilities, yet unspoken.  Should the detective give up, since there's no way to know which of the infinite possibilities is true?  Or are the stories told by the 2 witnesses (and not the junior cop's theory) substantially more likely scenarios?

Thus I maintain that god-candidates with religions with claimed witnesses are more likely real than theoretical polar opposites.

&gt; You are assuming that there does exist a true, known religion

To be precise, I am *concluding* it.

&gt; If you cross out the words ""unknown"" and ""unrevealed"" in that paragraph, you have my original argument.

Agreed.  Your argument is relevant regarding the infinite assembly of theoretical, unknown god-candidates.  My point is not that your statement is incorrect, but that its scope is limited, and that scope is made irrelevant by Pascal's wager.

For those equally likely god-candidates, there is no information to determine their likelihood over their polar opposite, and therefore no path to reward warrants taken, as it is negated by an opposite, equally likely path.

However, god-candidates for which a religion exist are more likely (see cop analogy above) than their theoretical polar opposites.  So a fair application of Pascal's wager is to consider the path with the optimal (reward * probability)."

My point was: the Vikings run to the playoff was on Peterson historic year and that he wouldn't repeat so they were a .500 team; that the Lions still had no defense and a terrible coach; the Bears would regress to the mean, their turnover ratio was unsustainable and without them they were even more average than the Vikings (they were a couple of Bears fans so I was harsher on the Bears); that the Packers have no defense and that a one man show could get them 9-10 victories max.

So my statement was mostly to piss them off. I had no hope the Rams would get 10 wins, I thought .500 max. It came much closer than I thought though."

bisousdarling,MakeupAddicts,1389717811.0,"**Sephora Perfection Mist Airbrush Foundation**

I was planning to do an entire post on this, but my camera did something funny yesterday and I was nervous about my memory card, so pictures were not taken, mi malo.

I picked this foundation up in the ""Fair"" shade since I looked it up via Color IQ thing and it said it was a 4Y01. I'm actually about a 4Y02 via Sephora's system, but I also wear foundations in the 4Y01, so I went with it. Luckily, the tester in the store was full, so I tried it out and saw that it matched almost perfectly.

The whole reason that I picked this foundation up was because I've heard that it's a dupe for the Dior Airflash. I don't own the Dior version, so I can't say whether or not this is a dupe, but from YouTube videos and blog posts on this foundation, a lot of other people seem pretty sold on it. The downfall of the Sephora foundation is that it only comes in 5 shades whereas the Dior foundation comes in 10. You get 2.5 oz with the Sephora, which is a slight bit more than the 2.3 oz Dior version. 

I wasn't completely sure what I expecting when I went into using this foundation, but I am so fucking ecstatic that I bought this because it looks absolutely amazing. 

I *do not* spray this directly on my face; I find that method to be messy and wasteful. I spray this on the back of my hand and then apply it to my face but I also imagine you could spray it directly onto a brush and do the same thing. The coverage is a solid medium coverage and I believe that you could take this up to full coverage if you applied another layer of it. 

The finish of the foundation is something that I've never had success with in earlier foundations. It is a beautiful satin finish that isn't too matte and not too dewy; it just makes your skin look refreshed and natural. This is an oil free foundation which is great for someone like me who (in the winter) has slightly oily skin. My skin gets much more oily in the summer, so I'll have to test this out again when it gets warmer and more humid. But, for my winter skin, it works beautifully. I only get oil break through on my nose, but that happens with every single foundation ever. I do set, lightly, with my NARS Pressed LRP, but I've forgotten once or twice and the foundation still holds up very well throughout the day.

I've been using this foundation for the past 5 days and each time I've worn it, it's stayed on my skin pretty much all day. The only circumstances that really change how much foundation is staying on my face is how much I'm rubbing my face all over my dog or boyfriend (this is a normal thing to do, right?). It definitely lasts all the way through a work day without much breakdown and I'd say it really only starts to fade around the 12 hour mark.

Now, for the cons. I feel like this is going to run out really, really quickly. I can't speak as to how fast it will actually run out, but I am going to keep track of this so that I can figure out if it's actually worth it. 

Also, the can says to shake for 5 seconds before use and they are really, really serious about that. I count, very slowly, to 5 in my head while I do this because if you don't shake it enough, it comes out bizarrely and not mixed up enough. 

And the last con, and this is my own stupidity, but if you hold this too close to your skin, you can burn yourself. I guess I kind of just forgot that this has propellent in it (it's aerosol, so you know) and that propellent can burn your skin. The foundation comes out of the can cold, but the first time I sprayed this on my hand, I held the can like an inch from my skin and I burned myself (from the cold). It's not a massive burn, but I would be really fucking mad if I had done this to my face. [Picture here](http://i.imgur.com/S3SaxvT.jpg)

All in all though, I will definitely be purchasing this again regardless of how quickly I go through the first bottle. If I blow through this in a few weeks, I'll just save the foundation for times I want magnificent looking skin (aka every single day). I really like that Sephora has been trying to step up their game when it comes to their own products and this is one of the best of their products that I've ever tried!"
LWdkw,truegaming,1389717819.0,"You are making many assumptions that I entirely disagree with. And therefore, I disagree with your conclusions.

&gt; At the core of every game are systems, mechanics, and (hopefully) innovative and novels forms of play. 

That's not true. There are many aspects to a game, and even though mechanichs (which is the form of play) is one of them, not all games focus on mechanics. Some games focus on stories. Some games focus on visuals. Some games focus on interaction with other players. And most games focus on a mix of all of these. So no, a game should not just be judged by it's mechanics.

&gt; The article contained a scant 2 sentences about the actual game beneath the Dracula lore, the rest were all (valid) reactions to the artwork laid on top.

So? The article is not a review on whether or not the game was fun to play, it was an article on how that game made her uncomfortable. 

&gt; The answer to the first question is the fact that we have become an industry that fixates on visuals.

That is just not true. There are many great games that don't fixate on visuals. Now if you rephrase it to 'an industry that fixates on polish', which graphics are just a part of, I would reconsider (although I would argue it's more the consumer that fixates on polish), but no, I do not agree 'the industry fixates on visuals'.

&gt;  By and large the games that win prestigious awards are the pretty showcases that push hardware to its limits.

What rewards are you looking at? I would argue that especially over the last few years, with the immense growth of the indie industry (and the corresponding awards), many games have been awarded prizes that do not push hardware in a graphical way at all! Think of [Braid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)#Awards) or even [Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)#Awards).

&gt; they fail to find words to describe the various feelings that games (not visuals but mechanics) evoke within us.

Do you have any examples of that? Because I simply disagree. Take for example this review of [Dear Esther](http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/02/13/dear-esther-review).

&gt; Is their behaviour acceptable? No, but is is comprehensible.

Really? *Really?* Threatening people with rape because they would have liked to be able to play a female character for once in part v of a series that has three seperate playable main characters is *comprehensible*? Not in my book. I absolutely can not comprehend why anyone would call people cunt/dick or threaten them with rape/death over writing an intelligent article over well, just about anything, ever.

&gt; However, even if every person in the industry agreed with these articles, and every other game featured a female hero with realistic proportions, it would not make for better games.

I don't enjoy playing games with women with unrealistic proportions. Therefore, games without those are better than those with them. I would like to play a female hero with a realistic story every once in a while. So if there were more games with those, games would be better.
So basically if there were more games that I would enjoy more, *ofcourse* games would be better. I don't see the thoughtprocess that led you to conclude differently.

&gt; Now that we have established that our goals align,
If by that you mean 'making better games', sure. Otherwise I don't really understand what goals you mean.

&gt; Instead of disparaging the next triple A title for featuring yet another blond, white space marine, we must insult it [...]

Why? If I don't enjoy it for the reason that it has yet another blond, white space marine, why should I pretend differently? That would just lead them to 'fix' things that don't bother me as much, wouldn't it?

&gt;  consumers who see beyond a game's wrapper to the core underneath

Who are you to decide what aspects of a game other people should enjoy? If others get more enjoyment out of graphics, story, setting, or the achievement system, who are you to dictate to them that they should primarily focus on mechanics?

&gt; If journalists foster consumers who see beyond a game's wrapper to the core underneath, game companies will no longer need to pander to insecure males seeking a power fantasy or recluse otaku looking for a brake from their daily grind. 

I am again entirely missing how to second follows from the former.


TL;DR I think you jump to weird conclusions that deny me the right to like or dislike in a game what I like or dislike in a game, and instead would like me to have the exact same focus as you seem to do.

Also, with the amount of room I have (due to years of not contributing), do I have a lot of room to play around this year if I had to?

I'm just thinking of a hypothetical worst case scenario, but how would something like this work...

I manage to contribute $5,500 this month maxing out my 2014 room. Then next month I take out $5,500 to deal with an emergency.

But the month after that, I am able to replace the $5,500

So can I do it without issue (the 'replacement' $5,500 is deducted from a previous year's room), or would essentially $11,000 in contributions this year (+$5,500, -$5,500, +$5,500) nail me for 2014 (at 1% per month) or would it have no effect since I started 2014 with $26,700 in overall unused room anyway?

This of course is hypothetical, but if I can figure out the worst case scenario I think I'll be able to figure out the rest of my TFSA room questions

Once you are dispersed the money, you can spend it however you'd like. You can be responsible: rent, food, books, etc. or not: a couple of kegs, a baby pool, 100 boxes of jello, and some strippers. Technically it's probably *supposed* to be used on school-related expenses, but it's not like they are going to ask for receipts. And parties totally count as school-related anyway."

fuckingchris,AskReddit,1389718016.0,"Personally? I prefer the Singaporean system.

In Singapore, they use common law, the same as in the US, where precedent is the basis for most rulings. All courts are beheld to the supreme court, which gets its appointments by the president, after being given a recommendation list from the Prime Minister, which the Chief Justice assists in making as a consultant by law. All lower courts are appointed in a similar fashion. They have no juries, and instead have justices taken from academia and the legal profession, as well as other positions if the recommended appointee is deemed to be fair and well suited to being a judge. All justices are incredibly well policed and many judges report their experiences to the schools from which they were taken for study by fellow academics. It sounds like too much power is put in the hands of the few, but the courts have been found to be incredibly fair, especially in economic and non-capital proceedings.

Granted, Singapore is a city state surrounded by powder-keg countries on all sides, is one of the largest trading centers in the world, and has countless cultural groups that for the large part -hate- each other living in close quarters, so their government tends to be rather controlling. Still, it is an incredibly lovely and safe place to be. It is the most futuristic city I have ever seen."

I would contact a police detective or officer to come talk to her about the seriousness of what she's doing, to tell her how it's illegal, how it can get her and others in trouble, and to tell her a little about the sex trafficking industry. 

I think the other thing that could be get her attention is her social life. I'm not sure how you would impress this upon her other than posing as a classmate who found pictures of her, but seeing how her peers would judge her for something like that may actually get her to stop.

And yes, something like that may scar her, but I honestly think it would be better to be scarred by judgement like that than wind up in jail, kidnapped, or dead which is exactly where she's heading.

If you have FFEL Program or Perkins Loan Program loans, you may consolidate them into a Direct Consolidation Loan to take advantage of PSLF. However, only payments you make on the new Direct Consolidation Loan will count toward the required 120 qualifying payments for PSLF. Payments made on your FFEL Program or Perkins Loan Program loans before you consolidated them, even if they were made under a qualifying repayment plan, do not count as qualifying PSLF payments. In addition, if you made qualifying payments on a Direct Loan and then consolidate it into a Direct Consolidation Loan, you must make 120 qualifying payments on the Direct Consolidation Loan.

chrunchy,canada,1389718237.0,"I think that the main pushback on this is going to be from small and medium businesses like family-owned retail companies. Looking at the burdened cost of hiring an employee we're talking about a ~25% increase in labour costs.

Now, what the government might do is increase the min. wage slowly over a period of four years which will allow these businesses to increase their prices appropriately.

Of course, large business and multinational corporations are going to push back as well - but these companies are less likely to be hiring minimum wage workers (but if they do then they have a fuckton of them i.e. IBM vs McDonald's).

The large companies will see their profits dip the quarter that the minimum wage is introduced, but they will recover very quickly by raising their prices appropriately. 

One side effect is that some people earning minimum wage might stop using public transit and move to a cheap car.

There might be less demand for Mac &amp; cheese and more for fruit.

There might be more demand for continuing education courses as poor people could start being able to afford a class at the local community college."

The prosecution has to prove every element of the offense but the defense has to prove every element of the affirmative defense (basically a defense that admits the crime but says it was legally justified). The judge didn't find the number of plants he had was enough evidence, by itself, to prove intent to sell so dismissed the possession for sale charge; however, the defense failed to prove he had only enough marijuana for his medical needs (a requirement for the defense) so the judge held him over for possession."

The way it works is you download their trial apps for points, you click to download the app, you run it for 30 seconds and when you go back to safari you get instant credit. 1500 points is 5$, most apps pay between 80-240 with the average being around 100. You can delete the app immediately after you get your points. Apps won't credit twice though, so be mindful, you also can't ""double dip"" and get credits from two of these services for the same app. 

When you cash out the giftcard appears instantly, you hit redeem and a code appears, no waiting like the other sites which do the same thing. It also pays much better than any other similar site. Pays much better meaning that it gives more points for an app and takes less to cash out. 

To try it just click the link http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/f00fa46f and it will open in safari. 

The cash out options are available in 5$ increments so like 5/10/15 for the more popular ones and they scale as 1500pts/5$. 

The options are as follows:

Amazon gc

iTunes gc

Hulu plus- 1500 for 1mo

Pachacamac,AskReddit,1389718358.0,"There were plenty of roads, and the coastal Andes are pretty flat (very sandy, but would have been flat, well-packed roads in the valleys), but lots of hills between valleys, and a lot of trading would have been valley-valley in the middle parts of the valleys, which have significant, steep hills between them (I call them death hills. It's a wonder I haven't fallen off one), or are very sandy, and even the modern highway gets covered with sand often. Or trade went from a coastal valley into the mountains. And the roads going over the hills might have steps, be steep and windy, etc., plus there are rope bridges over rivers in the mountains. Valley-valley trade right on the coast probably would have been done with boats. 

So wheels would have only been useful within a single coastal valley (and there were some huge valleys), but llamas were the only pack animals (alpacas were mostly raised for their fleece), and llamas can only carry 60 pounds or so. So it made more sense to have llama trains and people just walk and carry everything everywhere, but Peruvians even today walk very quickly over any terrain.

There were no potters' wheels, either. There's no reason why Andean societies could not have used them, but they didn't, and that didn't stop various Andean peoples from making some of the most spectacular pottery in the ancient world."

Sleep walking happens during stages 3 and 4 which isn't REM, so you aren't dreaming and don't have sleep paralysis.

abeyante,AskWomen,1389718498.0,"Because your defensiveness is provoking some harsh reactions, I figured I'd jump in here.

You sound a lot like me, at least with regards to what triggers your tears. FOR ME, I noticed that the biggest thing that makes me cry (in that uncontrollable, visceral, ""oh shit I'm crying in the middle of talking about something that needs to get done"" way) is feeling *HELPLESS*.

It helps to realize that crying is an adaptation we social animals developed to signal those around us that there is a problem that we can't solve on our own. Children cry when they need an adult. Adults cry when they need something they can't provide alone. When most people--especially me--feel frustrated and, more importantly, *helpless*, it can provoke tears. 

So what I do in situations like what you're describing (phone convo re: program placement) is remind myself that I'm NOT actually helpless. It can feel helpless, because you've backed yourself into a corner, or whatever. But remember that there is a solution, that you are working towards fixing your problems (after all, you're on the phone trying to sort everything out!) and that you aren't stuck with no options.

For example, the first time after having this epiphany that I really had to use it was when I was on the highway and my entire wheel fell off my car (lol yes really). My car tilted to the front left as the corner hit the road, I slowly applied the brakes and pulled over. My core self wanted to cry. Holy shit, my wheel just fell off, I'm stuck on the turnpike, it's night time, and I'm alone with no one to help me. Helpless!!!! But I remembered my newly realized crying trigger (helplessness) and thought to myself, am I helpless? Let's run down the list of options. I calmed down and I called a tow truck. Everything worked out. And since I realized I wasn't actually powerless, I DIDN'T CRY ONCE. I managed to suppress my feelings of helplessness before the tears started.

Now, deeply emotional things will still make me cry. But the kind of useless, annoying crying you're describing doesn't happen to me AS OFTEN anymore, and when it does, I can better suppress and/or stop it, because I know where it's coming from. Remember: You are NOT helpless! :)"

First, I am stuck in a Hebrew rut, not being able to get out of it. I need to get more fluent in my reading. 

Second, one thing I've always heard is that the Hebrew in the Tanakh is very vague - that just as important as what is said is what is not said.

clairebones,TwoXChromosomes,1389718961.0,"Oh, the sentence-finishing thing makes me laugh, my SO does it all the time and has no idea. I think it's adorable, but it does get frustrating on occasion if we're talking about something important.

I know exactly how you feel. People do seem to see it as laziness, even my SO's mother often assumes he just can't be bothered, even though she knows about his ADHD and lived with him for longer than I have. We know they aren't lazy, or inconsiderate, but for people who aren't familiar I guess it's easy to assume that.

Usually if I need him to get my stuff while he's at the shop, he'll phone me so I can walk through what he needs to get and what other options to get if that isn't available. 

Yeah I agree, it's reassuring to know that you aren't going crazy and other people have the same things to work with. I found the /r/ADHD subreddit can be helpful too, there are quite a few partners of ADHD sufferers there discussing techniques for helping their partners."

jerrysburner,TrueReddit,1389718987.0,"An anecdotal story doesn't make a pattern. What works for someone isn't guaranteed to work for others. Not everyone is suited for college. 

Human intelligence is on a curve - by definition half the population is not as smart as the other half. But lets assume that the top 75% are smart enough for college. What about the remaining 25% - do they not count? Poverty is a requirement because they can't complete college?

Now, let's get back to that 75% crowd that is capable of college. There's obviously a group what while meeting the minimum criteria to get a college degree, it will not be anything in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math). We're already flooding the markets with business degrees. This means that those who will benefit from a non-STEM degree are going to be the smartest (of which you might fit in that group by the sounds of it). 

But there's another aspect to all of this - intelligence isn't the only indicator of college success. If the people in question don't possess the drive/motivation, planning and foresight, and other required skills to earn a college degree, college will simply be another failed endeavor adding to the monthly bill load. 

But lets say all 75% do go an get their degrees. Are there enough jobs in all the available fields that require a college degree? We know that STEM has been growing in demand and there's a good chance it will continue for the foreseeable future, but as people flood these fields along with the pressures of out-sourcing, wages get depressed and you still find yourself in a similar situation that described by the OP."

I really like the flow of this base. It can survive a vehicle camp pretty well and the way the walls are sturctured feels like something right out of Starship Troopers.

**Zurvan Amp Station**

Despite all of the flaws with an amp station design (being too easy to zerg), amp stations are still some of the best fights in the game due to their open design and walls. Zurvan shines from its location. I always have a fun fight at Zurvan. The three bases surrounding Zurvan are very well made. They don't get vehicle camped easily and they are excellent footholds to attack Zurvan from. They are pretty much everything you want in a satellite base.

**Crimson Bluff Tower**

It's always a good fight there. I think it's a combination of the surrounding buildings and terrain. I don't like tower fights but with Crimson Bluff it's an exception. Something about how every approach to Crimson Bluff allows for different strategies and that Crimson Bluff is a very important strategic point so it's worth fighting over."

Personally, I don't like half of these qualities and don't care for some others; all I need in a woman is to feel attracted to her, but beyond sexy looks, a healthy concern for one's body image and being nice, I'd rather have more traditionally called ""masculine"" features in her, such as being strong, dependable, straight-to-the-point, etc. and dealing with shit rather than crying over it and being an emo-crap mess."

Every day, there are 10's of 1000's of exchanges being made on the various BTC exchanges around the world.  This shows that while many people believe the currency will go up in value, just as many believe it is going down in value.  The slight difference in buyers/sellers is what moves a BTC coin value up and down.

So, if this many people out there believe BTC will lose value, why not spend the money on items you need from places like overstock?  This way, you can save the transaction fee of the exchanges.  "

Normally when I've seen the no real tall problems line before I've just dismissed it as harmless venting, this time I felt compelled to respond because it was a fellow tall person on /r/tall.  
  
Oh yeah, the point about my eyes/teeth/gait wasn't that it was necessarily caused by my height but that being so much physically bigger made these defects impossible to miss. I could have kept on listing negative aspects of being tall but it sounds like you're familiar with plenty of those yourself. Like you, I wouldn't claim to know what it'd be like to be 7' despite my height probably peaking at over 6'10"" before my spinal problems. Indeed, I'd bet that my experience of being tall would be unrecognisable if I'd been born 20 years ago into an affluent American family.  
  
Yeah, it surprises me that there's often a certain hostility that reappears from time to time because in real life I've often found that there's an affinity between tall and short. It might just be in the nature of the internet and maybe even reddit in particular, that these things happen every so often. Unfortunately these things now seem inevitable."

zjpeters,everymanshouldknow,1389719935.0,"I don't see what any of this has to do with the public school system, it just so happens that you're boring, though you don't have to be. Part of the problem is that high schools often give only a small group to choose from. When I was in high school I had a group of friends, but as a whole we weren't all that close, and I only talk to a few people I hung out with then. When I went to college and was surrounded by more people I was able to find people who shared my interests. And as college went on and I got older I found more people with similar interests and hung out less with people who I didn't like. With more experiences under your belt you have more to share with others, the more you share with others the more you'll get along, the more you get along the more you'll hang out, the more you hang out the less bored you will be. This is true for friendships, relationships, and work relationships. You don't need knowledge of how to better kill time, you just need knowledge of the world. Go out and learn a craft, get a hobby, discover something you enjoy. From there you can share your love with others and maybe they'll want to try it, or maybe they already have and they'll want to talk about it. You don't need to go out and take classes with your friends to be closer because if you're with quality people you will be learning from them even when they aren't trying to teach you. I can tell you that if one of my friends got up and said ""Guys, we need to learn more together, let's go take a class on botany and start a garden"" I wouldn't have the slightest interest. On the other hand, my friend might tell me about a friend of his who gardens, some of us might show interest in gardening, and we decide to go hang out with the gardener.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389720014.0,"&gt; Source? Somehow removing all government regulations would eliminate all technological advances made over the past two hundred years? We would all go back to working in sweat shops? Computers and tech jobs would disappear?

Ok, now you're strawmanning. I was talking socially, not technologically.

&gt;The free market has done more to lift more people out of poverty over the past 200 years than Government ever could dream of doing, and mostly in spite of Government regulations hampering their growth, yet you attribute all the advances over the past 200 years to Government... what a messed up view of history...

Capitalism helped MAKE the wealth, but it's a very crappy DISTRIBUTOR of wealth. Honestly, what helped the poor and middle class was government meddling with these social programs and regulations you seem to despise, as well as unions, which have largely disappeared. Capitalism, in its raw form, is just a slightly more justified form of serfdom. 

&gt;How is it flawed?

It has a very immature concept of liberty. It seems to be rife with angst against government in the same way teenagers are angsty about their parents. They dont know what half the rules are even there for, assume they're bureaucracy or meant to hamper growth, but they actually provide vital functions for society. 

Libertarianism isn't half bad in terms of, say, personal freedom, but economically? It's horrible. Sorry, but the ""free market"" and the whole concept of asking the rich nicely to create jobs to benefit people voluntarily isn't gonna work, because they'll create as few jobs for as little money as possible and overwork people as much as possible. While I'm happy you've taken a step beyond some of the more crazy libertarians on subreddit and decided to support basic income, libertarianism is basically the freedom for the poor to choose their masters or starve. Admittedly, UBI would get rid of the starvation thing, but it would still kill any hope of social mobility many people on basic income would have. Both measures are necessary IMO. 

The thing you need to understand...a lot of transactions libertarians call ""voluntary"" are actually made under duress, and made with two sides of unequal bargaining power. While UBI is a step toward equalizing conditions, it doesn't do enough on its own, and taking the minimum wage out from under people will lead to more corporate greed and using UBI as an excuse to pay even less. 

&gt;Then there is no reason to prevent someone who wants to work for a few dollars an hour from doing so.

Um...once again, you seem to forget that unemployment is high, but with UBI and projected loss of people in the work force (one study cited 17%, most had less or no impact, some had more productivity), we would be VERY close to full employment. We have no need for a reduction in the minimum wage. And I seriously doubt it would create a lot of jobs anyway. If a job needs to be done, it needs to be done, and if they can do without it, they'll do without it. Citing specific examples of one guy creating a job below $6 an hour is an anecdote, not a statistic. It's an exception to the rule, not the rule.

&gt;The paragraph you wrote right above this statement proves why this statement is false.

The small marginal gains people would make are nothing compared to the massive loss to all of society."

My personal take (take that for what you will) is that an egg (with yolk) a day is a healthy, nutrient dense addition to a wholesome diet (veggies, fruits, whole grains, legumes, seeds, nuts, fish, some meats, some dairy). This amount of eggs may be too much if your cholesterol is already high though--I'm not one to say. Anecdotally though, my LDL (the ""bad kind,"" 59 on my last blood test) has actually dropped lower than my HDL since becoming stricter about my diet as a whole in this way. At the time of this last test I was probably eating five eggs a week. Again though, variety and and the big picture are key.

Which experts? Even experts have an ideological tinge. For example, if we were to bring in experts to fix our economy, which expert would you bring in? Art Laffer (the guy who helped build Reagan's policies) or Richard Wolff (economics professor who has a left wing podcast)?

Just because they're experts doesn't mean they're not biased.

&gt;This is a good point. Silencing controversy is not something anyone wants. But, it's easily solvable. In the soft sciences, they use a certainty cutoff at 95%. So, you could say that if more than 95% of the scientists agree on a crackpot theory, it's a crackpot theory.

This could be problematic if 10% believes in a crackpot theory or something.

Also, what about the possibility of them abusing power? A major factor that has made American style democracy so successful, is that the politicians are ultimately responsible to the people?. As you know, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely, so what's to stop these ""experts"" from using the power to their own ends vs the benefit of the people?

&gt;  Games like Call of Duty, Halo... have a design to make us keep coming back for more.

Actually, no. They're designed to be fun, but most companies don't really care if people keep playing after the sale was made. Sure, maybe on an ego level they do, but once they've got their money, they don't care.

Games like the mentioned LoL (and DotA, TF2, WoT, etc) could be considered intentionally addictive through the use of micro transactions, but only in the same way that Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic the Gathering cards are. Certainly, there are people who fuck their lives on that, but do you blame the game or the person who couldn't control their own life?

Now, am I ethically opposed to intentionally building in ""addictive"" practices? Not at all, and that's actually the focus of my education (data mining and applications for iterated development of games). My objective is to create a game that fine tunes player's experience based on data pulled from them and the rest of the community, then use that data to improve the title down the road. 

I really fail to understand why it's anyone except the user who is responsible to not get people addicted to things. This is true for the tobacco and alcohol industries as well. The broad majority of users/consumers are not abusive with the product; most people drink socially or on occasion, most smokers aren't going through more than a pack every day or two.

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389720585.0,"Plug these 5-letter codes into Google to learn more.

The first, second and fifth fund you list have high 'front-end loads'.  One of them is a bond fund with a yield of 4.42% and a front-end load of 4.5%.  That means that if you stay in the fund for a year, you will almost have as much money at the end of the year as you did when you bought it, because the first thing that happened was that the fund swiped 4.5% of your cash for itself - that's what a 'front-end load' is.

All these funds also have over-average ""expense ratios,"" which is an annual recurring fee you pay for the privilege of being invested in these funds.

You would have done much better to go to Vanguard and invest in one of their target date funds, or else allocate your assets among Vanguard funds yourself.  Vanguard funds are no-load and have very low expense ratios.

Your investment advisor is almost certainly receiving a kickback for investing your money into these funds, by the way.  The kickback to him is paid by the fund manager out of the front-end load money that is taken from you.  This should be illegal, but it's not."

heres_a_llama,Christianity,1389720620.0,"&gt;Pretty much it was ""They ignore the law."" Any responses? Do you accuse Orthodoxy of error of any kind?

I think one thing that helps clarify for me is that when Orthodox say law, they not only mean the 613 mitzvot in the Torah, but ALSO, the explanations that have developed over time, AND the legal system that explains how to go about this process. I don't think any Conservative or Reform debate what the 613 laws are, or what the explanations that developed over time are... more like the system.

I reject the Orthodox system of law.  That is the ignoring that they mention. I do not think that just because this rabbi was from 200 CE and this rabbi from 400 CE or 2014 CE, that the rabbi from 200 CE is automatically right, or better, or to be deferred to. This is the ignoring they mention. I do not think issues of ""is my glass Pyrex I bought at a yardsale kasherable?"" is the anywhere near the same thing as arguing ""can my daughter wear tefillin?"" This is the ignoring they refer to.  

You've heard that ""you must be strong and flexible like a reed"" saying that I'm butchering at the moment? I think Orthodoxy has built the strength, but not the flexibility, into their system. I think Reform has built the flexibility, but not the strenght, into their system. 

My issue with Orthodoxy is that they build a system that can only go one way - more stringent. Never back. Never to say ""well, we built this stringency because at that time, in that place, it was necessary to ensure we didn't violate this prohibition. But in THIS time and in THIS place, those conditions aren't present, so we don't need this stringency anymore.""

My issue with Reform is that Judaism has never been JUST about the individual, so to say 'take this system we've built... and go decide for yourself what to do with it.' just screams inauthentic to me.

My life, in so many ways, would be SO much easier if I could just accept Orthodox. But that heart, mind, and soul that I'm supposed to love G-d with doesn't allow me to remain there... 

So I'm Conservative by default, and left in a dying movement where I fear I will have no community in which to raise my kids to adulthood.

&gt;Do you pray for the dead?

I say yartzeit to commemorate their memory. But I do not ""pray for"" them in the sense of ""Please G-d, remember their good deeds so they can get out of 'purgatory' faster"" or anything like that. Sorry if I'm way off base, but that's what I would interpret a Christian explanation of ""pray for the dead"" to mean.


&gt;What is the purpose of the Law?

To guide our lives in accordance with G-d's will so that we may understand our individual rights, privileges, and obligations, and thus build a more just society."

elemonated,Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,1389720719.0,"I don't think that's fair to either modern music or the work that goes into product branding.

Music's never been about just ""art."" The most popular music back when the greats were around were sonatas and sonatinas; entertainment music, written almost solely for dancing. Folk music was *never* about art because art was for rich people. I could go on if you'd like, but while you might not like pop music, I think your reasoning is flawed."
Cykuta,pics,1389720719.0,"That's true. You could give them the same looks in a story about fantasy-vikings or something and it would still fit. Not that it doesn't fit the dwarves, in my eyes. It does. But the Sexy Line of Durin could definitely stand there among the nobles of other species and fit right in (or, in the case of Legolas who - let's face it - looked terrible, steal his girl :D)

But I think it's a good thing, in a way. Dwarves did usually get the short end of the stick, and I think their very ""design"" as a race is partly to blame for that: the idea of dwarves is very alienating. Small, yet very strong, child-sized but with the appearance of old, grumpy men, living underground (where do they get their food from?) and having no truck with anything that makes people *people*, such as sentiments and feelings, contact with others and so on. Most of the company stayed that way, but some of them had to be ""humanised"" and I guess a visual key was chosen to help this along.

Kinda like the most incredible, lovable, attractive and precious and sexy and important women in films are always redheads. There is no real reason why they would be so, and zero nil truth in the stereotype. But many films will use that like a color-coding thing: the readhead is sexy, green liquid is poison and so on.

I'm not saying it was the best choice to make. There were a few very good choices made in that film, and a few abysmal ones. This one is somewhere in the middle, but I see where is it coming from."

Kzickas,FeMRADebates,1389720736.0,"&gt;So, accepting that, why do the sexual fantasies and the power fantasies so rarely wind up doing anything together?

Because superheroines are both heroines and sexual fantasies, but the former before the later. The fact that you are making a character for a superhero comic necessitates that you sit down to make a superhero then decide to make her a teenage boys wet dream. Where as say Twilight would by necessity of being a romance novel have been written the other way around, sitting down to write a teenage girls wet dream then deciding to make him a vampire. This is probably why comic books have sizeable female following and romance books don't have a similar male following. And having sizeable female following is why the former get criticized for being too excluding of those outside their primary demographic. If they were more excluding of them they wouldn't face that criticism."

maowsers93,worldnews,1389720791.0,"Yeah, I mean the United States has always been like this. This statement here "" every natural resource and every living being is commodified and exploited to collapse"" rings true for everyone in this country that isn't of Caucasian Decent. Even then the group of people who were relieved from exploitation had to be of Western European decent and have a belief system based on in the Protestant teachings. 

My mom's family is native by my dad's family is Sicilian which was about as bad as it got for Italian decendants and those people as a group were hated pretty badly. I mean the history books are rife with examples of the exploitation of even white people if you weren't the right kind of white. Italian women died by the dozens in the triangle shirt fire because their employers wouldn't let them leave the building when it caught fire, the Irish were all but taken forcefully as back up troops for the civil war, eastern European descendants were targeted and some times killed because of things like the red scare and an extremist fear of communism. People think of signs like ""no coloreds"" but there were also signs that read ""no Irish"" for example. 

This of course says nothing of the treatment of my native ancestry which were pretty much hunted to extinction/submission, slavery, the treatment of the Chinese. I mean damn, the Chinese really got the rub because they were treated terribly and almost no one remembers. They were seen almost as stationary objects that could be used for gain. Chinese people were sent into mines with dynamite to blast holes for production. 

So, you'll have to excuse all of us while we laugh when people say that the  US is just now using people as means of resources. The US has built it's economy and status off the back of people who were used as resources. The only difference now is that the defining line between who is used and who isn't isn't race, it is socio-economic status so everyone is fair game. Now that white folks are thrown into the mix people are calling it a new age of totalitarianism. It isn't a new age, the players have just changed. 

And pardon me because I know people will take offense, but quite frankly the way people are being used now as compared to what my ancestry was used is like childs play. Even today when people are used as a commodity they have a quality of life. My great-grand-parents were shaken from their houses in the middle of the night and marched with none of their belongings with the clothes they were wearing to bed through multiple states to a new location, and all because the US wanted the land. That doesn't happen today. So, when I hear people complaining about things like the NSA (which is obviously an over reach that needs to be addressed) and they call it the new historic totalitarianism I can't help but think they're being either extremely ignorant or extremely childish.

Sure I can find someone ""unconventionally attractive"" beautiful--and I often have; my type is varied!--but if the person in question doesn't strike me as sexy right off the bat then I've learned I shouldn't bother trying to force attraction. (**step one: profile picture**)

If they've passed that step, it depends on their message. Did they obviously read my entire profile, comprehend it, and do they express themselves in a clear manner with no chat speak or lazy grammar/syntax? (**step two: the message itself**)

If the first message is good, I go to their profile. I LOVE how OKC has such a fantastic question system. I've never used any other dating sites so I'm just talking about my OK Cupid process here, obviously. I go to the question section first and check for sexual compatibility (I'm a submissive/masochist and if a guy has answered that he's submissive too then we're not going to work out), then I look at their hobbies, interests, background (education, religion, politics, etc), morals, and all that fun stuff. Then I read through their profile. If they look like someone I could be friends with, that's the final test. (**step three: the profile**)

THEN, and only then, do I message them back.

kakersdozen,OSU,1389720797.0,"I can't really help you with the questions specific to Fisher, but for the rest of it...

A benefit of a large school is a large alumni base, and Buckeyes like to help each other out at the school and in the real world. You won't get a job just because you and your boss are alums, but it can help you.

Football tickets aren't as hard to get as basketball tickets. Football tickets are released with a certain percentage to each rank. They are also really easy to buy on game day or the few days before. If you can get into the stadium, you can sit by your friends regardless of what your ticket says. Basketball tickets are a lot harder to get and if you want a good seat, get there early.

A fake is not necessary unless you were a child prodigy and are going to be a few years younger than your friends. I never had one and only ever wanted one a couple of times. Freshman and sophomore years, it's mostly dorm parties (if your RA is cool) or house parties, no ID needed. Even after that, once people start turning 21, house parties are still common if you are a late birthday (like me!). Not that I encourage illegal behavior, but door guys won't call the cops on you for a fake. They look at you and go, ""Haha No."" and then you leave. Now if there is a cop at the door with the bouncer, then you deserve what you get for being that dumb.

OSU police really aren't that strict. Don't blatantly do it in front of them, but they aren't trying to bust parties and write 100 underage tickets. That's a lot of paperwork. I got caught once because of a noise complaint at a party and the cop knew I was drinking. He looked me up (no priors), and told me, ""Look, I don't want to arrest you or get you in trouble. I don't care that you're drinking, but I do care that you guys are being loud and the neighbors are mad. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here."" Then let me go. Just don't be stupid. That's the general attitude of the cops here. **Except** on game day. Under no circumstances should you drink on a porch, lawn, sidewalk, parking lot, even out of a solo cup, underage on game day. They have undercover cops who are young and wearing OSU apparel. Unless you have a fence, they can go as far as the mailbox to look for underage drinking, and they do. If they find it in plain sight, they can then enter and find more underagers because they have reason to believe the law is being broken (note: I'm not a lawyer, but this is how I understand it). They are notorious, but just be smart: stay inside and drop your cup if someone yells ""Cops.""

Favorite things: 
The amount of opportunity due to size. There is a club for everything (Club Sandwich FTW) and all sorts of opportunities to meet people and go cool places. If you are bored on campus, you're doing it wrong. 
Oval Beach when it is warm.
Location. It's urban enough to always be alive, but not so urban that it doesn't have greenspace.

Least favorite:
Off-campus housing. This is probably going to change due to new sophomore residency rules, but most places off-campus are expensive shit holes. The nice ones are very expensive. You can get a decently nice place for a reasonable price with roommates, just know that you will likely not be in a modern apt with granite and stainless appliances or anything like that. You are lucky if you have a washer/dryer on site. Unless you parents are paying rent. Then the world is your oyster.
Parking. Walk to campus or spend 30 minutes getting to class from your car after paying $400 for a permit. Parking off-campus is difficult too. Don't bring a nice car. It will get probably sideswiped, keyed, and have mirrors punched off my drunk idiots."

gravvs,PurplePillDebate,1389720973.0,"Okay so everyone here is giving really shit advice because not many of these people are coming from your standpoint and understand your point of view. They think that you have to give up sexual opportunities just because you don't want to go all redpill. You don't. You can sleep around in a way that feminists won't be able to criticize. 

I used to be a fat awkward kid. I was the kid that all girls told their problems to but nothing more. I was quiet. I considered myself a 'nice guy.' 

Now I'm in shape. I currently have a girlfriend and I have to regularly turn down girls. Before this I was sleeping around quite a bit. 

And I still have very close platonic relationships with girls. 

I wrote down three goals for myself:

1. Get in shape.
2. Become more charismatic.
3. Learn how to identify and act on my own desires. 

Getting in shape is hard but simple. I was fat so I needed to lose weight. I'm not built by any means, but I'm tall and slim now. I don't know what kind of body type you have, so it's hard to recommend specific advice. I do know that you can have a face that's ugly as sin, but if you've got a six pack suddenly it doesn't matter anymore. But physical attractiveness is only one aspect of how attractive you are.

As a corollary to this learn how to dress. /r/malefashionadvice is a good place to start. /r/malefashion is a good place to get inspiration on your own style. Your style should say something about your personality. If you want to say a little more about yourself we can figure out what kind of looks you might want to try.

Next is charisma. I believe charisma comes from three main aspects: how interesting you are, how funny you are, and how confidently you can present yourself. Becoming interesting is about developing hobbies and passions that unique, and that you can explain in an interesting way.  You've mentioned that you have hobbies but I don't know what those are. You should elaborate so we can explore this more. 

Humor and confidence takes practice. So from today you are a confident person. I don't care if two seconds ago you weren't confident. From this point on any time you will banish any lying thought telling you that are anything other than confident. You are. You are bold and outgoing. And the next party you go to you are going to make five new friends. Don't have any parties to go to? Find a bar. Go make friends with strangers. Any nervousness you have is a lie. You aren't a nervous person. You are confident and likeable and everyone is blessed by your presence.

Once you get comfortable talking to strangers start talking to women. Go to bars and just start talking to them. Some of them aren't going to give you the time of the day. That sucks for them. They're missing out on an interesting person and they're life is worse off for it. But you wouldn't want to talk to someone who clearly has such bad taste anyway. Rejection is going to suck at first. But after you get rejected a few times you'll realize it doesn't suck at all. Once you realize this you'll have a lot more confidence and and the rejection will be fewer and fewer. 

But let's talk a little more about you. What do you do for a living? Are you a student? What are your hobbies? What excites you about the world? How do you dress? How would you like people to see you? 

Just tell me a little about yourself and let's go from there."

tortillaandcheese,AskWomen,1389721009.0,"This will either be helpful or sound like superfluous crap, but here goes.

While I agree somewhat with what most people are saying, I also think it's important to acknowledge that yes, the things you hate about yourself might actually be undesirable to the general population. If you just constantly convince yourself that you're beautiful and that every aspect of you, physical or otherwise, is flawless and marvelous, you aren't going to learn to separate those things from your actual value as a human being. Flaws and beauty aren't mutually exclusive. You are not a sum of your parts, and you are especially not a sum of only the parts that you hate (and those are the ones we tend to notice).

An example: I hate my nose more often than not. It's not really abnormally shaped but it's definitely larger than what is considered ""feminine"". People constantly advise me to beat myself over the head that I'm beautiful until it sticks. But, alas, the weird mind voodoo shit didn't work for me; it always felt more like self-nagging. There is no getting around it. I have a proboscis. It's a huge nose. Sometimes it's beautiful and unique and sometimes (and to most people) it just ruins my face. But it doesn't have to. It's just a nose. It's a part of your body that older relatives pretend to steal between their fingers and then eventually you just sort of use it to smell things. Just like extra fat, or wide-set eyes, or chicken legs, or low cheekbones, or whatever.

Even the most attractive person has flaws, whether they're physical or just shitty aspects of their personality. They might not be appealing to most people, but instead of focusing on the hope that someday someone will look past them or see them as beautiful, I find that for me it helps, on ""ugly days"", to focus on function and not so much form. Take a thousand pictures of the part of your body that distracts you from the full picture of who you are and what you look like. Get to know it. Intimately, until it means nothing at all. Like saying a word over and over again until it's just a word and no longer has meaning to you."

neenoonee,IAmA,1389721048.0,"I've always tended to adapt myself to where I see gaps in the market. Even with the pest control I've noticed gaps where we could make more money and invested money in side projects (such as deodorisers for waste sites etc). 

I recently graduated from a good British university with a decent degree in a subject where any possible job leads require public funding. Unfortunately these roles are disappearing due to government cuts to charities and government bodies. So I adapted. My parents already run a successful waste consultancy business and with that comes pests - rodents mainly but in the right conditions you get a bit of everything.

I'm pretty good with all things creepy and crawly and having lived in remote areas in tropical countries as part of previous jobs I've had, I'm pretty good at not freaking out at stuff. My brother had just finished school and was looking for a job, I was employable but there was nothing out there - so we figured we might as well be working for ourselves and making ourselves money than someone else doing something we actually really enjoy.

Sorry to make it so long, but in short I never saw myself doing this in a million years. I just adapted to where I saw a gap and took the risk which is paying off slowly but surely!"

sockalicious,space,1389721367.0,"Some astronomical phenomena, such as Type Ia supernovae and Cepheid variable stars, are constrained by their physical properties to exist only in a very narrow window of absolute brightness - that is to say, we know how much light they give off to within a few percent.  Since their absolute brightness is known, their perceived brightness to an observer here on Earth depends only on their distance, and that's an easy calculation.

Another way of measuring distance is parallax.  The Hipparcos satellite has conducted the most accurate parallax measurement of nearby stars and has found that in general its measurements are in agreement with other methods of determining distance.  Hipparcos can't be used for very distant objects, but the methods which it verified can be.

You should be aware that the most compelling evidence for dark matter and energy are actually distortions in the very distance measurements we're talking about - particularly in the case of gravitational lensing, which is a 'natural experiment' we can use to quantify the distortions you're talking about.  So you've gotten the cart before the horse in your second question.

In other words, it's not that we came up with the idea of dark matter and then asked how it could distort distance measurements.  It is that we noticed that distance measurements are distorted in a way that we didn't expect, and then invoked the concept of 'dark matter' to explain why.  Dark energy is a different concept but stemmed from similar distortions in certain observations."

mmp31,politics,1389721401.0,"&gt;huh? are you saying that rich people don't budget? or poor people budget more?  

Neither. I said that the poor are often better than the rich at budgeting.  

&gt;budgeting has no correlation with wealth. if i had to bet, i would say rich people are much better at budgeting. 

Then why are you saying that the poor need to be singled out and taught how to properly budget?

&gt;i do tax returns for high net worth individuals and they are very good at planning income and expenses to minimize tax liabilities and maximize gains. they have more resources to assist them in doing so.

That's not the same as having to budget for how much food you and your kids can eat in one day so you can afford to pay your gas bill.  It's a lot more intense and stressful IMO.  A lot of rich people have never had that sort of experience.

&gt;what i'm saying is that it takes a decent amount of knowledge to be able to do this. at least a couple of community college classes or a broker. now we are talking 100's maybe even 1,000 dollars that is needed to invest smartly. if you aren't as knowledgeable, the risk is greater that you just lose that money that could be saved for a rainy day. 

For one, that's not necessarily true because somebody could teach themselves by reading and not taking any classes. Or they could just plain get lucky.  Two, even if it was necessarily true, I don't see how that would be relevant to the point.

&gt;do you realize how you just contradicted yourself? 

How?

&gt;instead of saying, ""here is $100 to spend on food per month and $400 to spend on health insurance a month and $1000 to spend on rent a month"" you would rather say ""here is $1500, spend it how you like?"" at least with the first example, people can say ""oh that 100 is plenty for food per month, i can bump it down to 75 when i don't need SNAP"" or ""that $400/month was not adequate insurance, i should spend more once i don't need subsidies."" how does that teach anyone to budget?

What happens when that $100/month for food isn't enough? It helps them budget because then they can determine what percentage of their income they can spend on food, what percentage they can spend on gas, etc. to fit their individual needs.  Instead of the nanny state making a one-size-fits-all policy that tells everybody exactly how much they have to spend on what.

&gt;pretend a stranger came up to you and said he needed $500 to pay a credit card bill. would you rather directly pay the bill or just give him $500 cash (theres a chance he will use that $500 for drugs or booze or a prostitute or something else illegal).

&gt;i'm not saying all poor people don't know how to spend money. but poorer people are statistically more likely to participate in illicit activities. when you give someone $1,500 to spend however they want, they are much more likely to do so instead of giving them $1,500 to spend for specific necessities. 

That's not a valid analogy.  I'd be giving him a voucher that he could redeem to pay off a credit card.  Which he could turn around and trade to someone else for cash, which he could then use to buy prostitutes drugs, or something else that's illegal.  The system you advocate is not going to stop somebody who wants to spend their welfare money on things like that, it's just going to slow them down.

&gt;the govt might not know best, but its the govt's money, so they should have a say on where its spent. also, as a society, we have agreed upon the basic essentials needed to survive (food, shelter, clothing, insurance, etc.)

Are you going to tell poor people that they can only buy healthy food and not junk food? That they need to exercise and not smoke otherwise they won't qualify for healthcare?  Tell them they need to pass a drug test? In order for your position to be logically consistent, you'd have to have the government almost literally controlling the poor's lives by blackmailing them.  I agree that taxpayers ought to have a say on how the money is spent, and my say is that it should be used to provide a minimum income for all and a negative income tax, not an ""all or nothing"" welfare system that destroys the poor's individuality, independence, and their incentive to climb the economic ladder."

- No. He is the statistical average of all Bosmer. I do not believe he is a legislative authority, merely a personal one. He carries legal weight because of his position as being able to speak for all of Valenwood, but it is unclear where the line between legal and personal status is in his case. However, we do know that he is not the pinnacle of authority in Valenwood, because we have wood-kings: the Camorans.

    - Swarm power. Individual beasts are more powerful than the norm, but can be taken down. The swarm is, to use a technical term, ""hella strong"".
    - That's the only way to stop it.
- Dense forest to jungle. Likely to have biome gradients.
- Probably?
- I would assume strong minority, probably no more than 10%.
- Animals and on foot. No paths (destruction of plant matter), but known routes exist. Also, plentiful waterways, but boats have to be either constructed elsewhere or grown (there's an Apocrypha on it somewhere here)
- ...um. That's, uh... wow. I'm gonna have to sit down and think about that. But CLL's is a person and so far all the Stones are unique, so...
- pretty much just the Bosmer, and nature has grown so crazy that there's likely to be no exposed ruins. Maybe stone here and there, covered in growth.
- No. Cannibalism is ritualistic and only done to the dead. You have to cook them.
- Row, row, row your boat. Triremes would probably not do well because of draft requirement (they're very tall; three rows abovewater means there's more under water than for a flatter boat)
- What? No. Two completely different things. That's like asking if they're okay with rape because they're okay with cannibalism.
- It has. Cyrodiil cuts it down. Lot of border tension

If someone is asking a question here I think they want an honest answer  rather than a politically correct, socially acceptable , SRS approved, Feminist feels, Blue pill crying towel, otherwise the person would be asking men IRL.So if it sounds RedPill , Oh well . The red pill is mostly made up of men so their would be some cross over .

The Red Pill is different in the aspect thatunlike the others it is not a social or political movement , it's a philosophy that says there is a game going on beneath this thin veneer of society and relationships that you are probably not aware of , here is the rules to the game and this is how **you adapt** to win it.  That point is important, that you change to fit the game, your happiness depends on you, period. So anyone shouting about it and trying to convince others downvoting etc  , **they are doing it wrong.** You can be happy being the lone person at RedPill and live among people who do not see the game  . The other groups , feminism . blue pill , SRS their happiness depends on other people changing to suit their ideology, their beliefs are totalitarian in that we all have to be the same. So it is at the core to guilt and shame , accuse people, name call , downvote and Doxx and ban people who think different  than them . There can not be any opinions but theirs, so you can not prefer Asian women, women who dress a certain way , you are not allowed your own opinions or tastes or to be different  in those groups, you are told what to like and they will scream and harass and name call until you like it !!  *I like steak . No you don't, you like canned dog food. No I think I like steak . Fuck you sexist shitlord misogynist oppressor rapist racist !!!*     

The Redpill there is nothing to adhere too, So there is many different opinions at r/TRP many of which you don't have agree with and whole thing can carry on . You can bang a different woman every night or you can use it to win the heart of your childhood sweetheart and live happily ever after. You can date only Asian chicks or you can chase fatties , does not matter.  Everyone can be different and use it the way they want

heres_a_llama,Christianity,1389721636.0,"&gt;/u/heres_a_llama[1]  , why did you convert conservative as opposed to Orthodox? 

I guess my primary reason for not converting Orthodox would be guilt. I cannot, not even today, say to a court of three rabbis, I believe in all thirteen Ikkarim. I have serious doubts about the eighth, ninth, and thirteenth. 

So do I lie to myself? Do I say ""shut up, still voice in my head that says this doesn't make sense""? Do I make that sacrifice of personal integrity so my kids will never be doubted, so I don't keep Mr. Llama from his birth country, so my inlaws might finally do something more than just approve of me?

Do I lie instead to the Orthodox rabbis and their communities? Do I infiltrate their communities and touch their wine? Do I risk the rabbis professional reputations? Do I risk the marriage and children of other, real Orthodox gerim who have invited me into their homes? 

And now, now that I've lived as an egalitarian Jew, how do I go back to a Judaism that says what I find most fulfilling isn't for me as a woman? Do I do Open Orthodoxy? Does that put me in any ""better"" of a spot than Conservative in the eyes of mainstream Orthodoxy? 

&gt;at did you not find fulfilling about Reform?

With all due respect to my Reform brethren and my Protestant hosts, I felt Reform to be like my friends' chuches without Jesus. Shabbat for most of these communities was Kabbalat Shabbat every night, and Shabbat morning once a month. They were half in Hebrew, half in English. They read on a triennial cycle. They played music on Shabbat. They served meat and dairy together at onegs. I felt like it was a social group more than a religious group.  And the pettiest reason? I hate that (some) Reform rabbis wear black robes and tallitot that are stoles/scarves. Put it on properly, G-d darn it. Oh wait, you can't. It's only four inches wide.

1. Orthodoxy should try to stop the wave of ""I am more *machmir* (stringent) than you""

2. When the Sanhedrein (Jewish high court) is reassembled, we can undo some of the more stringent things that we do."

The older I get, the more I realize that most people don't get to work their passions-- and that getting good enough to make your passion your career isn't always the best idea. I never, ever, ever write for fun anymore, because I write all day for magazines and stuff. Another friend of mine who loves cars got a job working in a garage and quit 6 months later, because he said he could tell it was going to kill his love of cars if he stayed there. 

I guess what I'm saying is, not every job makes your heart swell with passion, and that's OK. Figure out what your passion is, though, before you do any job hopping, and really look into what it would take to achieve it. (Do you know how many people have asked me how to be a writer? Do you know how many people actually followed through?) But don't leave a good job because you're in your 20s and not quite sure where you're going. As much as it may seem like it, everybody else does not have their shit together.  All your friends getting married? In five years, there will be a wave of divorces.

 You can use the back button to get to options, there are some things like search, profiles, kid mode, etc. but not much else. From the main screen, if you go up you'll hit search/your queue, otherwise going down you just get a random assortment of categories. 

New releases/Recently added are among them, so you can still find those, but I still don't know of a way to get regular categories. We wanted to watch Christmas movies a few weeks ago, couldn't find a way to do it. Just searched 'Christmas' and 'Holiday' and it just returned things with those words in the title.

What's not cool (and hasn't been addressed yet) is that your wife was aware that her alone time with this dude was making you jealous, yet decided that she was unwilling to sacrifice said alone time in order to reassure you. She went out with drinks with this dude, knowing that would make you uncomfortable, and then had him sleep in your mutual home, again knowing that would make you uncomfortable.

If nothing else, she doesn't seem to be too concerned about the happiness of her husband. She was unwilling to be bored for a night in order to not risk making you jealous.

In my experience most people reject God because they don't think they need Him / don't think they need for Him to exist.  I'm just confused how  you would talk about ""how we're saved"" without talking about ""why we're saved"".

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389722003.0,"&gt;Is it affordable for most developed countries?

Yes, but it would require much higher taxes than exist today in most places.

&gt;How would it compare to what is currently spent on everything that it would replace? 

I figure we could get rid of about $2 trillion in spending. $1.25 trillion if we wanna exclude medicare/caid (I'd treat these differently since UBI can't adequately replace them). UBI, on the other hand, could likely cost $2-4 trillion depending how its implemented. Probably about $2.5-3.5 trillion is the most realistic range. We'd need a flat tax of like 30-40%, maybe even higher, to pay for it. This sounds like a lot until you take into consideration you'll get a lot of that money back every year.

It shouldn't affect inflation much on a macro level, but I'd expect drastic shifts in the economy, leading to prices of some things to go way up, while prices on other things will go way down. Look into the concept of income elasticity of demand for more details. This is assuming we fund it with taxes, rather than printing money. Printing money would lead to inflation."

I know wal-mart tends to have slightly worse prices than target, but it's much more convenient for me to get to(on the way back from work, compared to having to drive on the highway into the next county for target) so I end up saving money in gas and wear and tear on my car.  If I didn't own a car, it would be my only option(no bus from here to target, and payless is also in the next county).

I do try not to shop at wal-mart when I can afford it, though, as they're not a very good company to support.  It's just when I'm down to my last $20 before payday, there's holes literally through the bottoms of my shoes, and there's a blizzard coming in that night, when I have very few options.

Back then I freaked out constantly and was often a wreck emotionally.  Take care of yourself, but I agree with delk82 that you need a community.  WoW can provide some social outlet, but when it comes down to it, you need real people near you who really care about you.

While I am extremely introverted, and I don't go out much because I am married and have a young baby, I really wish that I would have made more friends when I was around your age.  Instead I isolated myself and played a lot of video games.  My excuse was that I hated the party scene and didn't want to drink or socialize, but looking back there would have been plenty of opportunities to make good friends in small groups and hang out in other ways.  As for narcolepsy, I know a girl with it who is extremely extroverted and has a very full social life.  Not that I would want to trade places with her, but just saying it's possible if you want it.  And of course we all know tons of social butterflies with ADHD.  

From first year of college until the end, I worked part time, and during the summer I worked full time.  I also had a bad relationship and stayed in it for far too long, because I was so isolated and didn't really see examples of other, healthy relationships.  Although I thought I was sheltering myself from the bad influences of the outside world, I was staying away from the positive influences at the same time.  

When I was your age, I had various online friends via gaming, and I did play a lot of MMORPGs including WoW, but over time those friends have all disappeared.  I did meet my husband in WoW when I was 25, but that was after a lot more maturing and self-improvement, which was done in a non-gaming context.

Don't feel bad about your situation, but I encourage you to really think about what genuine friendship looks like to you, and try hard to keep those true friends in your life.  You don't have to party with them, but you should try to keep up a connection with them.  The 4 years of college may seem long now, but they'll be over in a blink.

einTier,Austin,1389722174.0,"Something to keep in mind, this is how ""professional"" couch surfers operate.  They *know* it's difficult to throw someone out and make them homeless.  They ask to crash at your place for ""a few days"" while they get stuff sorted out and they'll impress upon you that they've got no place to turn *right now* but they have a plan that will work out.  Soon, a few days is a few weeks and hopefully for them, a few months.  You have to kick him out, he's worn out his welcome and placed unreasonable expectations on your generosity.  If you don't, he will stay there until you do. 

I knew a guy who was a master networker at this sort of thing.  He was actually presentable and looked respectable.  He made friends everywhere, and once he met your friends, he made a point to meet their friends.  Only thing is, while your opinion was that you were just two people who kind of knew each other, he was telling your friends he'd known you for years.  He'd mine your facebook and social media for all sorts of information he could use to support his story. 

Then, when someone kicked him out to the street, he would just show up on someone's doorstep asking to crash on the couch because his roommate had gone crazy and for safety reasons he couldn't stay there anymore.  You didn't know him all that well, but he was good friends with your other friend, and who can't spare their couch for a few days?

mstrymxer,CFB,1389722415.0,The crowds will be decent regardless as long as they put the games in football areas. LA isnt one of those. The games based on this years standing would be FSU vs SC and Auburn vs Mich St. As long as the area has a good amount of football fans I dont see how you can turn it down(as long as the tickets were reasonable). The real problem comes for fans of those teams who have to get quick travel arrangments. I think the crowds would be sold out if there were two weeks between games. More fans would travel.

Her0_0f_time,stocks,1389722430.0,"Starting out as well. Right now just on paper stocks. But I have a lot of downtime on my job so I have time in work to research stocks and other such things.  If I didnt have the down time, I would be treating my home life as a second job. Researching what I can before I have to get to sleep.  I really have only been at this for a week or so now, and I can see that there is a lot more to the job than just looking at a chart and seeing what is going up.  already 2 days into my paper stock app on my phone (Stock Market Simulator on the android) and already I have made $200 off of the $10,000 they give you to start out with.

So heres what I have been doing for the past few days. Get up, put CNBC on the TV while eating breakfast.  Get in to work around 7ish.  Do my normal work duties if I have any (Work in IT so work load changes from day to day) When all my work is done, usually within the first hour or so I look at a screener to see what happened the previous day with stocks that are not on my watch list.  See if there are any to add or whatnot.  

Here is the settings I use: http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=211&amp;f=cap_microover,sh_avgvol_o500,sh_price_u10,ta_beta_o0.5&amp;ft=4

Do some research on companies that took a large hit over the previous month or so. See what kind of news there was. If a product was canceled or there was a bad earnings report or something like that I pass over it. If a delayed product or a change in management, I add it to my watch list for a few days to see whats going on. If it looks like it will make a good return and I have some spare cash to send that way in my app, I will buy some shares. Amount depending on what I have out there at the moment. That usually takes me to about 1 or 2 and then I have time to spend doing other things online for a bit. Get home around 4, put CNBC on for end of the day recap and play some games. Get a shower around 9 and go to bed.  Wake up the next day and repeat.

If I couldn't do anything that day in work due to a heavy work load or whatever, I would cut out the games at night and spend that time doing whatever research I normally would do."

badaboopdedoop,todayilearned,1389722481.0,"Well, sort of. Trees don't use energy in the same way that animals use energy.

Trees rely on pressure gradients to move water up and down the stem. When there is water in the soil and the leaves need water, the pressure of the water at the base moves the water through a very thin layer of cells up the tree to the leaves. Sort of like a very thin and very long straw. It's almost entirely mechanical. So it's not hurting the tree to have to move water and nutrients a longer distance.

Also, as trees grow ""up"" they're attempting to grow taller than trees around them. If a tree is taller than the surrounding vegetation, it receives more sunlight and will continue to grow at a faster rate. So they have a competitive advantage by growing tall."
Ribald_Partisan,Cooking,1389722483.0,"I have to make garlic aioli every day at work and our recipe is based on the Les Halles recipe.

We use a Cuisinart food processor. I have only broken my aioli twice in a year of making it:

1. Add your garlic cloves and your eggs yolks. We use 15 egg yolks to yield 3 - 4 cups aioli.

2. I pour enough olive oil to fill a 1-cup measuring cup halfway.

3. Start your processor, wait until your garlic is minced, and then start pouring your olive oil in a steady **but thin** stream.

4. Do this, slowly, until you notice that your mixture has thickened. There is a change in the sound of the food processor whenever your mixture has ""set"". When it looks thick like that, you can start adding oil faster.

5. **I season my aioli right as it thickens** -- so that it is still thin enough to mix, but not so thick that it won't turn.

6. I continue to add oil until the mixture is too thick to turn quickly.

7. I then add  about a quarter cup of vinegar to cut the mixture back down -- it will thin out.

8. I then add more olive oil until the aioli is the thickness that I desire.

**Even more importantly**, if your aioli breaks *you can still make it*.

1. Pour the broken aioli into another measuring cup.
2. Break 2-3 egg yolks in your processor.
3. Start your process over, adding oil VERY slowly. (Don't add garlic on your redo.)
4. When your mixture is set, add the broken mixture VERY slowly, until it is incorporated.
5. Congrats, you have resuscitated aioli.

KaNugget,changemyview,1389722667.0,"I totally agree that if technology progressed to the point where robots could take care of us then humans wouldn't need to work menial jobs and we could just work jobs that will advance society culturally. I think one of the biggest problems with this is that our ""capitalist overlords"" would never allow people to live comfortable like this, but that's another point. 

Theoretically we live in a Utopian society where no one really needs to do anything. That's boring! I'm an artiest, so I consider culturally advancements such as music, writing, art, Hell even video games, to be important jobs in our society. And in practically we're going to need scientist and engineers for research and maintenance. So I think jobs will always be important, but I do not think careers, and being stuck in one deadend job for years is necessarily important. 

I think you just need to broaden what you consider to be a job. :D"

OK, this makes me feel better. I guess from your initial wording I imagined this was someone you had to see frequently, who maybe lived in your family home, or whatever. I got emotional and jumped to conclusions, sorry.

This sounds more like the typical scenario in familial sexual abuse. I'm so sorry you've been getting what basically amounts to a brush-off for so long about this. It seems like your family has a very strange atmosphere regarding sex and sexual abuse that might be playing into this (uncles speaking explicitly about underage girls in front of the young children? ugh, I know too many people like that...).

I'm glad you seem so self aware and independent in this area of your life. It's important to be able to build your own support network, and to be able to rely on your own strength. I do feel like you should confide in your SO though, if only to know that you *can* have that outside support if/when you may need it :(

JonWood007,changemyview,1389722725.0,"This isn't about what I believe. This is about you not accepting that morality exists. I could try to explain it, but it could very well be much more complicated than a reddit post (trying to wrap up 6 years of studying political science/criminology and morality is a single reddit post is kind of impractical). To try to sum it up, humans, almost universally, do not like pain, we do not like death. We form societies to prevent these things from happening, and these are seen to improve our lives. Since we do not like pain, and since we are animals according to the theory of evolution, we should not impose pain on other creatures more than necessary. I doubt that will be convincing to you, but if you want the shortest, no BS answer, that's probably it. It comes from a sense of empathy...but if you don't have empathy, it's gonna be harder to convince you beyond your self interest...and since an animal feeling pain is detached from your self interest, you're likely to not care all that much. You're just at a different stage of moral development according to [kohlberg's scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). You can't convince a stage 1-2 person of a stage 5-6 morality, for example. Which is why I have little interest at this point of seriously trying. "

God is an idea held by humans, not a being we can demonstrate.  The idea started to die in the Enlightenment period, and it's been dying ever since.  Nietzsche was just pointing this out.

&gt;does society as a whole benefit from the distinction between ""Don't do evil things because God said so,"" and ""Don't do evil things because the Law says so.""

Evil is subjective, so the problem with laws from God is that they can not change in a changing world, and soon what was seen as good becomes evil.  Society benefits from flexibility.

The zen Buddhists mean that our minds define our reality.  God doesn't exist, but he does exist in the sense that people believe he does and that alters their behavior.  There is no way if you don't try, there is 1 way if you try once, there are an infinite number of ways if you keep trying."

In the book she lives as a low wage worker for a year despite being a middle class magazine writer. For the most part she does a good job of earnestly trying to make the decisions a real poor person would have to make. She comes to a point where she is offered a legit sounding job for something like 13$/hr at a hardware store that requires a preemployment drug test, but she takes a 10/hr walmart job instead to avoid the test. I felt she betrayed the supposed purpose of her book by making a decision nobody to whom an extra 3$ an hour really matters would make by not chancing the drug test (it'd been weeks since she smoked and she wasn't a regular smoker) and taking the lower paying Walmart job instead.

My impression of her in that moment of the book was that she was making the kind of silly decision based on emotion that rich people have the luxury of making but poor people do not. The not taking the test/job was self indulgent not the smoking pot. 

The rest of the book is really good but I felt like that moment went to show how hard it is for middle class people to understand that when you're poor you have to sometimes suck it up and do really unpleasant nerve racking things to survive."

I left my Bachelor's degree in Math unfinished because I found that most mathematicians (at least at my school) were swayed by how much they liked you versus how well you knew the material. I could go on for several pages about it, but that's not the point here. 

The point is that I don't like academia and I'm not interested in increasing my existing student debt if it doesn't have the same ROI as doing Kaggle competitions.

&gt; A lot of people who win kaggles just use random forests with a lot of monkeying around with features and hyperparameters. That's really not mega impressive--

If it's not that impressive, than it seems doing Kaggle would be a good stepping stone.

&gt; If you don't have any other examples, and have not done much other work in the field, you're probably wasting your time in Kaggle. Watch the Andrew Ng online course, buy some textbooks and learn the stuff. 

I did the Ng course but I did not finish because I was not aware (at the time) that coursera courses could be published to your LinkedIn profile after completion.

&gt; Then build some new stuff. then post the code. Write about the code you wrote on your resume, and post the link to where you posted the code.

I'm working with another Redditor on a project. I have yet to get back to him, so I have to work on that today.

&gt; honestly, you are trying to substitute (insert resume lines here) for 4-8 years of college coursework and research-- so whatever you do should be commensurable with that if you want to have a reasonable prospect of working in the field.

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389723065.0,"I came here to say this exact thing. I live in Texas and while women's rights movements may need not apply in other parts of the country here we are fighting the same old fights that our grandmothers won. 

To give a quick example here, a woman recently of 33 who was 14 weeks pregnant was found unconscious by her husband. She apparently had a blood clot in her lung which had left her without oxygen for an unspecified amount of time. The doctors think that it might have been something like an hour but no one really knows. She has now been clinically labeled as brain dead and basically no longer alive in the sense of life function. 

So, her husband tried to take her off life support. He said they had talked about it before and she always made it clear she didn't want to be on support. Well, the state of Texas said that no, no you can't take your basically dead wife off life support because she is 14 weeks pregnant and that even though the fetus was also without oxygen for about an hour that the woman had to continue to incubate the fetus. 

So, here in Texas if you are a woman you don't even get the basic rights of life and death which is whether or not you want to be taken off life support and your family isn't allowed to make end of life decisions for you. If you are pregnant, not matter how far along you are, you are a ward of the state and your bodily organs i.e your uterus, must continue to be an incubator. 

The problem is of course that the fetus likely sustained severe damage while the woman was without oxygen but because they can detect a heart beat the family has no rights to her body. As a woman in Texas the state can actually claim your body as a ward of the state and nullify any legal documentation binding your family to your remains. The family of course will also be saddled with the hospital bills of keeping her on life support for another 6 or so months and what ever accrues once the likely damaged fetus is born. 

So, like you said, there are a lot of aspects to the new feminism movement that makes me cringe. The ""privilege"" bullshit in particular really gets under my skin. I had a friend who posted something about it on facebook recently that I almost posted on r/cringpics. But if we're taking the term and movement of ""feminism"" as what it was originally designed for there is a lot of room for it down in the great backwards state of Texas. 

Edit: And to point something out here, the law that went into place that is holding this woman's body was introduce in the 90's. Hundreds of bills regarding women's health have been introduced in the past decade in Texas alone. These aren't things that can be fought and won so move on, no, they keep popping up like a fucking whack a mole. "

My parents currently take care of her 2.5 year old *a lot*. And they were letting her boyfriend (not 2.5 year old's father) live with them under a single rule: Don't get pregnant again. Especially because the boyfriend has a 3.5 year old that's like a week apart from the 2.5 year old! Gahhhhh. What have these kids done? What do I do? I'm so helpless. 

Other thing: I took a class last week in Intercultural communication and I got my grades last night. Highest in the class with an A! (She didn't give pluses or it would have been an A+ because 102%!). It boosted my overall GPA a lot.

But functionally, the two games are pretty different. In RCTLL, you can't raise or lower scenery/rides above ground level. You can in RCT2. In LL, you have much more options for terrain textures. Not so much in RCT2. RCT2 has a lot of custom scenery and LL doesn't even have the ability to have CS created for it. LL has better scenario play, requiring you to beat parks in order to unlock other parks. RCT2 is more of a sandbox designer game, with all the parks unlocked automatically. It is much easier to create a custom scenario/workbench in RCT2 than LL.

I'm sure there are more differences, but that gives you an idea of what's what.

As far as what is ""better"", well that depends on what you're going for. We don't really argue about it here. Most of us play both games."

However, I aim for a certain time to get it. I can't remember right now, but I think I try and aim for 175 for Education.  When do you usually hit education? I'm still having trouble with really quick Science victories so you probably know better.

As for exploration:  I thought about opening it just for the Louvre, but didn't find it necessary because I already had enough great works of art slots. Additionally, I didn't care for the extra artifacts, and I didn't need them. I was able to dig 5 artifacts up in my game, and that provided enough to satisfy me.

It's not worth giving up Rationalism honestly, because Secularism is simply too good.  I only went that far into the Rationalism tree for this game, and it worked out for me. I also took the Order tennent that provides Science.  This one:

* Worker's Faculties: +25% Science output from Cities with a Factory. Build Factories in half the usual time.

And this boosted my science a good amount. I actually staved off opening Rationalism because this boost was bigger than the opener for that tree (rationalism gives 10% boost to all cities).  I'm not sure if I would go deeper into the tree if I chose Freedom instead. I probably would have.  But to sum it up, I don't think Exploration is worth the hidden antiquity sites.

Sunfried,funny,1389723275.0,"&gt; Trade since [World War I] has had to adjust itself to meet the demands of underpaid, underfed people, with the result that a luxury is nowadays almost always cheaper than a necessity. One pair of plain solid shoes costs as much as two ultra-smart pairs. For the price of one square meal you can get two pounds of cheap sweets. You can't get much meat for threepence, but you can get a lot offish-and-chips. Milk costs threepence a pint and even 'mild' beer costs fourpence, but aspirins are seven a penny and you can wring forty cups of tea out of a quarter-pound packet. And above all there is gambling, the cheapest of all luxuries. Even people on the verge of starvation can buy a few days' hope ('Something to live for', as they call it) by having a penny on a sweepstake. Organized gambling has now risen almost to the status of a major industry. Consider, for instance, a phenomenon like the Football Pools, with a turnover of about six million pounds a year, almost all of it from the pockets of working-class people. I happened to be in Yorkshire when Hitler re-occupied the Rhineland. Hitler, Locarno, Fascism, and the threat of war aroused hardly a flicker of interest locally, but the decision of the Football Association to stop publishing their fixtures in advance (this was an attempt to quell the Football Pools) flung all Yorkshire into a storm of fury. And then there is the queer spectacle of modern electrical science showering miracles upon people with empty bellies. You may shiver all night for lack of bedclothes, but in the morning you can go to the public library and read the news that has been telegraphed for your benefit from San Francisco and Singapore. Twenty million people are underfed but literally everyone in England has access to a radio. What we have lost in food we have gained in electricity. Whole sections of the working class who have been plundered of all they really need are being compensated, in part, by cheap luxuries which mitigate the surface of life.

Anyone outright putting one above the other in terms of *potential* thinks too highly of themselves.

You can put full weight behind 'potential' because nobody will remember in 3 years, so they wanna give off that 'knows it all' aura now.

Between these two tremendous powers, who is more likely to be victorious and what should we do, as Federation citizens?""

In any event, I agree that the Founders only care about themselves and see all solids as inferior lifeforms. They may not care if all solids are assimilated, including the Vorta and Jem'Hadar, as long as they find a way to protect the Great Link. At the same time they are masters of genetic manipulation, and they are timeless, so they can afford to hide on some obscure planet somewhere while they study ways to take control of the Borg Collective.

What does this even mean? How can the ""natural state of the world"" be bad, if *we could not exist without it*? Humans would not be humans without the environment in which we evolved.

As the Buddha said, ""life is suffering"". This is not a problem to be solved, but rather an observation that, once understood, contextualizes the *good* things we experience.

The ""elimination of all suffering"" sounds like a noble enough goal, until you realize that a) it's unobtainable (sans immortality, and even then, there's always going to be unrequited love), and b) if you cannot experience suffering, how would you even recognize joy? The warmth of the sun would be meaningless without the chill of winter. Neverending bliss would devolve into an existence more bland than you could imagine. This is the root of first-world ennui, where surrounded by entertainment options that should be the envy of any to come before, people are still ""bored"".

There's lots of *unnecessary* suffering to be stamped out, but most of that is not the product of ""nature"", but of systems of authority."

This argument was also [shot down in court a couple years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District). The claim that the tiny steps would have served no purpose to the organism is based on a false assumption that the current role of a mechanism was always that role. To sum up the argument that won in court, the previous ""version"" of an evolved feature, such as the motor on a bacteria flagellum, served different purposes along the way.

So what you're trying to say is that an eye, for example, that is only ""half evolved"" wouldn't function properly. The answer is, it didn't function back then the way it does now. Served a different role or worked in a different way.

heartjuice,GirlGamers,1389723663.0,"Honestly both sides of this argument bother me. Because I've been on both sides.

I dated a guy who was super into console gaming on the xbox. Every time I went to his house I had to wait for him to finish his round of whatever FPS was in at the time before we could hang out. It was so obnoxious. Because I was there and I wanted to hang out with him. But I'll admit I was young and overreacting since he usually stopped after that round and spent time with me.

Now with my current boyfriend, I've watched him play through the Dead Spaces games because I found them interesting to watch and I was too chicken to play them (first two were scary, third isnt at all lol). Since we're living together he plays games around me a lot more than my ex so I end up watching him sometimes. I don't get as enthusiastic as in the picture but I don't whine about him gaming like I did with my last boyfriend. We play games together. And I am also more of a gamer now.

That said, I liked the parent post on this chain by /u/ALittleCryingRabbit. And I also thing that this whole argument one way or the other is fucking retarded. If a girl's not interested in his games, he shouldn't expect her to be right there cheering him on. And in that aspect I agree with you. If he really doesn't like it, he should date someone else. 

Still, I think it's a stupid thing to dislike. And I personally don't think it's something someone should complain about or break up with someone over. I'm sure he (the guy who posted this picture) wouldn't get excited over her knitting (or equally girly) hobby."

At this point, I'm not sad that I had to see him (except for the whole rude/dismissive OBGYN thing--that sucked). I'm taking a really pro-active approach to all this, and I feel good about it. 

I've never been the type that insists on doing this ""all natural."" I suspect I'll feel the same way about childbirth too (I want an epidural, I'll be fine with being induced if it's necessary, etc). I sincerely commend women who want to conceive and deliver unassisted, but it's not my plan. 

I realized my cycle isn't normal, and much less likely to support a normal pregnancy. I also discovered that modern medicine may be able to fix it with little to no additional medical risk. My only regret is not seeing someone (who would take me seriously) sooner. 

I guess I went off on this tangent because there seems to be a slight bias (here and elsewhere in the TTC world) that seeking assistance looked down on in some way--like it means you've failed. I don't see it that way at all. To me it means that you're taking active steps to bring your baby into the world, and that's something to be proud of!!

Each one of us has a unique path to our babies, and if yours (or mine, or anyone else's) includes medical assistance, we should be free to make those choices proudly!!

* We're registered with a professional body, which means we have to show continual competence. This means that we both have to go on training courses to show we're up to date with good practice etc. Otherwise it's just a regular ltd company!
* We do regular advertising. My parents run a Waste Consultancy so there's quite a customer base to be tapped into there, but we have leaflets we send around, we do social media bits (feel free to follow us on Twitter and Facebook!) and we also have a stall I pop up at events we're invited too. Even simple advertising such as leaving a business card on the bar after a few drinks could end up somewhere. It's about noticing the little gaps.
* It's pretty sweet, I'm not gonna lie. I usually get up around 8:30 and head downstairs (unless I have an appointment) and then fire up the laptop in the office in the back room. I check emails, check whats booked in for the day, see if there's been any meltdowns anywhere or a sudden triple-boom in the local rat population (we can hope) then I either travel to deliver leaflets through doors (at both houses and businesses) attend client meetings, run errands, check the ££, check our chemical store and make sure we've got enough in stock for any future visits to clients. It's not that exciting, but working for myself means things are so much more flexible. Do I want to go out for drinks with friends at 1pm on Friday? Yeah I do and I can as long as there's nothing booked in. Need to get some shopping in? Go for it. 
* Cockroaches. They're not particularly nasty in themselves, they just get EVERYWHERE. Like if there's cracks in the wall, they'll get into the walls of the building where I can't physically reach. They show up at the worst time ever and because they're quite adaptable you can think you've got them all, see none for 6 weeks then all of a sudden see one. Sneaky little buggers.
* It's different for different pests, but generally just keep things clean. Grease and crumbs attracts smaller scavenging bugs inside and not storing your waste properly outside attracts the bigger pests. Unfortunately tiny pests are harder to avoid (such as fleas etc) because you could sit on a bus seat and pick them up, bring them home with you. It's quite rare depending on where you live, but they cause the most disruption. Just make sure you have a good LOCAL pest controller's number to hand. Try to avoid using national companies, us small guys need all the help we can get - and we actually care about constantly having your money coming in unlike corporations."

It was horrible, but I grew immensely as a person from the whole thing. I think a lot of guys would have broken completely if they were in the same situation, especially considering that I kept all my suffering to myself and never talked about it to my friends, even though they knew about the situation. My older brother told me afterwards that this whole ordeal is what turned me into a man. He said he could see a clear transformation in my personality and body language during those 6 months.

I don't want to go into too much detail about the whole situation, but I will say that it involved a psychotic stepfather who's hobby was destroying families. And that's not even a joke.

I think it is great that you are striving for both veganism and health.  They go hand in hand.  Every study shows that health and life expectancy improve with a no-meat diet.

I agree that the gender segregation is BS though. Girl Scouts typically leave scouting at a much younger age due to (IMO) having much less to do than Boy Scouts. I think the BSA is a great organization and they've already made some progressive steps like letting in gay scouts but they still have a long way to go. I want scouting to be an inclusive organization that invites people from all genders, sexual orientations (gay adults are still not allowed), and religions (technically atheists are not allowed). "

andjok,Anarcho_Capitalism,1389723876.0,"I get where you're coming from. Indeed, current property relations are the result of hundreds of years of state meddling and plunder. People's mortgages are done through a state controlled banking system. Property titles are based on what the state says is legitimate and not on peaceful homesteading and trade.

So we acknowledge that this distribution is quite wrong. The question is, what is a more just distribution? We can't really know, and lots of people will disagree on this. So I don't really like the idea of a ""planned"" property redistribution. Also, it's worth noting that since there is little homesteading allowed under the current regime, it isn't always fair to call people out on having ""unjustly acquired"" property.

What I think is more realistic and reasonable, is that through growing the counter economy and building institutions to replace the state (aka /r/agorism), unjust property titles should be ""corrected."" Now I'm not sure if that would work, but if it does, then institutions that depend on the state will die out, and eventually property rights will be determined through alternate institutions."

tjmjnj,AskReddit,1389723951.0,"I assume that when we say ""New York"" we are speaking of Manhattan and not the other 4 boroughs as well. Having spent my entire life living 20 miles from the city I'm certain I have been in all areas and I would have to say overall NYC is filthy. It's filled with crime and it's an overpriced tourist attraction. Not to mention it is insanely congested. As for attractions, well, there a few nice parks, I love some of the museums and overall there are a lot of things to do, especially food-wise. NYC is a culinary extravaganza. 

What do I like about London over NYC? Well, I feel London was much cleaner (we're speaking of central London, not the outlying wards) has far less violent crime, people are far more polite, and one thing that really stands out is that London truly is an international city. NYC claims to be but other than restaurants and shops there is literally nothing international about it, it is suppressed by ""American"". And another thing that irks me about NYC vs London is that London has held onto it's charm while still growing - the architecture is wonderful. NYC on the other hand has systematically torn down anything that is old and replaced it with glass and steel. So I guess I find London a far more visually appealing city as well. 

And yes, I have had the fortune of being in some not so nice places in England (namely some shit ass section of Birmingham, I forget the name of the area, I think the word black was in it) But again even in that city the canals are really nice and the downtown is looking pretty good.

So, if you look at a history book you can see that there was a direct correlation between men leaving those fields because women were entering them. Basically, if stringent sexism wasn't prevalent back then we wouldn't have these fields totally void of men now. Should there be proactive marketing for them to move back in?

Also, not judging whether all current prices are fine or not it is well known that for example some menial jobs will always be paid little. If suddenly that job was paid the same amount as the skilled, why people would bother doing skilled job? They would ask for more and then class higher would do the same, so there would be a national level of increase. I'm not saying it's a rule in general as for example some people already earn too much and that money could be put towards increase for those at the bottom... but still, the issue isn't that simple to be resolved by simply blaming immigrants for cutting wages."

Of course people are going to want to go to college to have a half decent shot at being middle class - our fine captains of industry have saved a couple bucks though so I guess it's worth it.

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389724571.0,"It's a little more complex than that. For example I volunteer for pro-women groups in Texas like Planned Parenthood rapid response teams, Naral Pro-choice, TFN, etc. None of them are for the advancement of women, they just step in when particular rights are being held in question again. To give an example in Texas 66% of the women health program budget was cut that caused the closing of almost 90 women's health clinics. This has resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars being used for unintended medicaid births. It is a pain in the ass and is just not good medically or financially for anyone. 

But the thing is you don't really see a lot of us. You can find us through google, you can find us a committee meetings at the state capital, you can find us creating groups to lobby for or against particular types of legislation, etc. 

The SJW's however are the loud groups who do absolutely nothing. These are the people you always see. They scream about privilege, act in an exclusive manner, and largely spend most of their time insulting people. These people are obnoxious and do nothing but make the plight of what we're trying to do harder by making people hate the cause. 

Last summer we were fighting against legislation that would have (and will because it passed) serious problems with women's health care under the guise of late term abortion. We were there testifying in large number, writing to our legislators, working with medical groups, etc. The SJW's however didn't testify, didn't speak to a single player in the capital, and did nothing but pick fights with the pro-life crowd while holding signs that said things like ""Free abortion on demand"". Guess what the newspapers picked up on? Two of these idiots started chanting ""hail satan"" to make fun of the religious folks (which pissed all of us off). Guess what the newspapers picked up on?? These people do nothing but prevent concerned citizens from actually giving a damn because they're afraid to be associated with them. 

Real women's groups whether explicitly pro-women, pro-health, or pro-freedom (which is what the FTN is) do not associate with SJW's. In fact, they specifically have PR people who try to deal with them to down size the damage that they inflict.

Then between the corrupt mayors and developers taking owner's money for homes that should not have been built. Combine that with the economic slowdown that hit both the US and Europe equally hard causing fewer people to travel to Spain which relies heavily of tourism and shit pretty much slowed to a crawl, home prices plummeted (same as here in the US) and the job market disappeared (though this is different than the US as most of the unemployed in Spain are young people, not head of households) - meanwhile, despite all this happening infrastructure development continued, much to my surprise I should add because during these years since 2008 they've managed to complete projects such as the high speed rail system.

What if the time you spend socializing isn't on topics that most people enjoy? You're going to get told to have more socialable interests.

The fact is that the entire model is based around being as socialable as possible. We can discuss whether that means likeable by 100% or likeable by 75% or even 50%, but I can't tell the difference, since all of these target goals have the same behavior."

Also, it may be a good idea to alter your route to pass some schoolmates houses, so you have a place to abort your run if you feel like you're in danger.

A less conventional route would be to wear ridiculous makeup and act like a crazy person if you find yourself in a confrontation. (makeup not necessary really) You won't meet crazy people if you're the crazy person. Talk to yourself like Gollum in Two Towers, mention the prophecy.

I don't really think ""too young"" or ""too old"" are that useful because it depends when you happen to meet the right person and what your life situation is. If two 22-year olds who had been dating for years, both had good jobs, and could afford to get married wanted to then I wouldn't think anything of it.

SloppySynapses,changemyview,1389725021.0,"Which controls are awkward? What do you mean 'closed'? 

The most fun part of league is the interaction with other players in a fast-paced setting where you not only have to perform well mechanically but strategically as well. There are an immense amount of immediate and long-term strategic decisions that you make every second of the game and that's what makes the game interesting. 

All of your points really have nothing to do with the gameplay (except the controls, but in 3 years of playing I've never heard anyone say that before) but more to do with the aesthetics and community. 

The levels are 'shallow' for a reason (if you mean simple/sort of small). There are a huge amount of decisions you can make depending on what part of the map you are on. If the map were any bigger, the game would become significantly slower paced because no one would ever be near each other. Not only that but then the amount of strategic decisions you can make increase exponentially and it would be so overwhelming that making strategic decisions would actually feel pointless.

League has a steeper skill curve than most popular video games on the market and as such it's quite frustrating to play at first. 

Like I said earlier though, you didn't talk about the gameplay at all really. Have you ever played a moba before? "
KaNugget,changemyview,1389725021.0,"You've had a bad experience with psychology, so let me show you how it can be positive. I have sever anxiety. I'm scare to interact with people because I have this little voice inside my head saying that I'm doing everything wrong and that everyone is judging me. Because of my anxiety I've spent weeks locked in my room, nothing speaking to anyone, missed many classes, and refused to socialize. I even had to take a medical withdrawal from school twice. And this was before I started treatment. 

I'm finally on just the right amount of medication to help my anxiety. I'm interacting a lot better and I can't wait for the end of January so I can start next semester! I go to parties now. Homework is easier because I'm less scared about sounding like an idiot in my papers. And it wasn't just medication that got me to this point. My therapist has helped me work through my problems. 

The truth is a lot of problems that kid have do come from learned behavior from parents. Parents aren't perfect. My mother has server anxiety, even worse than mine, that causes her to criticize every little thing I do, which is probably why I feel like I do everything wrong and have such low self-esteem about my appearance. But being aware of where I learned these feelings has helped me block them out. And I don't blame my mother. It's not her fault she's the way she is. I just want her to get the help she needs too. "

&gt; The ability to communicate what you've done be it in an interview, blog post, or documentation for a github project is much more interesting to me. Even if your spam filter isn't better then other options I want to know why you thought it might be and what experiments you constructed to evaluate it. 

I honestly don't think my option would be better than the rest. That's precisely what I wanted to point out. I can explain how I built it, but if that doesn't fit what a company wants to needs, than I don't see how that helps.

&gt; Some of the best candidates i've seen have done really cool side projects like analyzing and visualizing local neighborhoods to decide where to live. Having some toy examples with d3.js, scikits.learn or whatever on your github page would be a big plus even if they don't achieve world class performance.

komnenos,AskMen,1389725209.0,"Unfortunately I do sometimes.

The last girl I was with was incredibly attractive, every time we walked down the street I saw eyes follow us.  She was incredibly bubbly and (to my surprise) really intelligent, we would talk about history for hours.  Her skin was soft and she had the best lips and her eyes had a sparkle to them I have never seen in anyone.  it was an awesome feeling, throughout high school I had been trying to overcome my Aspergers and here I was in college with a beautiful sorority girl who melted a person's heart whenever she smiled, laughed, sang, talked, or in my case, when she touched me. 

My current girlfriend and I are a lot better suited for each other.  I still think she's is incredibly attractive and everyday she gets hotter but still... the other girl continues to be more attractive.  however what she lacks in looks she makes up for a thousand with her intelligence.  She speaks five languages, goes to one of the top universities in her country (and will be going to one of the best next year in my country for grad school) and we have gotten to the point where we talk with each other for at least two or so hours a day (and at least once a week we talk for seven plus hours).  She's such an intelligent woman and I strive to work harder in school so I can keep up with her.  

Also, she doesn't look for fucking ""signs"" all the time.  When  I went out with my last girl she ALWAYS expected me to pay and do everything for her.  I was the first person she had gone out who was her age since she was in high school.  Usually she would go out with people who were five, ten or even fifteen years our senior (both of us are 21).  She says its because of maturity but frankly I think a lot of it had to do with how older guys (usually) can afford to waste a lot more money on women.  I've only spent money on my current girlfriend once and that was paying for an application to grad school (those things are expensive!).  And she's made it up to me in a lot of ways.  

So, I don't care that she is less attractive, she makes it up in so many different ways and she makes me feel special everyday."

klabob,49ers,1389725231.0,"&gt; I didn't say /u/Phatskwurl said the Panthers played poorly in the playoffs - what I said is that the Panthers played nearly IDENTICALLY how they played against us at the beginning of the year vs. you in the playoffs. Great D, no offense. Effectively, you played them when they were playing poorly - you didn't beat them when they were playing well - just like we didn't. They did however beat you when they were playing well.

So you are assuming that /u/Phatskwurl agrees with you when you say that they played in the playoff like they did in week one. But, I for one disagree with you on this one. I think they played just like they did in our first meetup. The difference was that the Niners offense improved and the o-line outcoached the d-line of the Panthers.

The Panthers offense is like the Niners without Crabtree, they have a TE, one WR and can run the ball. If you have a good defense you'll keep them at around 15 points.

&gt; I am not trying to belittle what the Niners did either - again I am just here talking football. I get that a teams sub is usually a circlejerk for everything involving their own team and they are clearly holier than the rest, but it is a football sub and I am talking football.

You come in our house, say what the team did in the playoff is unimpressive and that you can't wait to see Niners fans ""be disappointed"". If you want to thrash talk, do it on /r/nfl. Most people are on /r/49ers because they want to avoid that kind of stuff. You can disagree and talk football, but don't be haughty, that doesn't fly. If you take time to look around, you'll see plenty of respectful Hawks fans get upvoted.

&gt; If you want to belittle who we beat this year and state that we didn't beat anyone, you have to accept that other fanbases are looking at your schedule and saying the same damn thing.

You used team from the top 8 of the NFL to try to belittle the Niners. If you had use the regular season, this whole discussion probably would have never happen.

&gt; You again haven't told me why I am making my fanbase look bad.

You came in here and responded haughtily and arrogantly.

&gt; The way I see it, I am trying to counter the points that you are attempting to make without looking through the rose tinted homer glasses you are seeing your team with.

I haven't talked about how the Niners played, so it's hardly rose-tinted glasses on my part. So I assume that you mean the guy you responded to first. If you wanted to point out that the Niners were not better than the Hawks on the road or that they had an easy schedule, you could have compiled the W-L of the opponent they faced. That would have been a nice stats and probably would have lead to an interesting discussion instead of this.

&gt; I don't go into subs making sweeping generalizations, either.

I never said you did, that was an exemple."

I think even if 5-10% of human population would survive after a climate crisis in 21st century, they would eventually recover and adapt to the new conditions and environment.

Whether they would renew their (at one point ancient) technological and cultural progress is debatable, but I think there would have to be something even more destructive than a ""mere"" scarcity of resources to destroy every single one individual of a civilization as intelligent as humans.

But then again, it feels contradictory using the word 'intelligence', since that same ""intelligent"" race could nearly die out because they were burning so much oil and producing so much energy."

RobOneXL,hockey,1389725311.0,here are my thoughts on Quick and his increase in diving. During the 2012 season he took a lot of beatings in the net. Because of his aggressive play taking away angles and getting low trying to find the puck he was always on the bottom of piles or getting clipped. Nothing dirty but it happened...a lot. I dont think he did enough then to protect himself. Im not a fan of goalies hacking at a player not making contact. But giving guys a push trying to create space or selling it a little when a guy plows into you. He wasnt doing that. Now he has gotten more physical. You could see right before Bieksa and Greene dropped the gloves there was a big battle in front of the net. Greene was trying to box Bieksa out and Quick kept shoving him out of the crease. He isnt scared of pushing guys or giving little jabs to give himself space. I like that and he hasnt resorted to slashing players for no reason. But he has started to flop a bit. Its not an every game thing. But seems to be in some of the more physical games when he knows he can draw the easy penalty. I dont like it and hopefully it doesnt become part of his repertoire.

The answer is obviously because ""colored people"" has a deep and painful history behind its connotation. But then, why is it that somehow, ""people of color"" is socially sanctioned? Don't they mean the exact same thing? 

To me, it's a distinction without much of a difference. I think both terms are insulting, because they both operate from the frame of ""not like them"", which establishes an inherent ""us-versus-them"" mentality that I frankly find more destructive than progressive.

My solution to discuss topics that necessitate making such a distinction is to just use the direct label. If I want to refer to my particular demographic, I'll just say ""South Asian"". If I want to refer to everyone except white people, I'll just say ""minorities"". I just don't think we need to mince that many words, here.

Basically if I'm going to use labels, I prefer to use labels that actually address the demographic I am referring to, instead of using labels that automatically place someone in a position relative to someone else. It just seems more respectful that way."

Thus you will hear a more vocal representation of people for whom it is a strong dealbreaker while guys who are less inclined in either direction feel less of an urge to speak up or get involved in the discussion. 

I will say that while there are men out there who actually prefer overweight women, my guess is most of these overweight girls are with guys who either a) don't mind overweight women/are indifferent about weight, b) find enough else about her attractive that the overall ""package"" is still attractive to them even if excess weight can be a minor turn off to them,  c) have a very wide range of body types which they find attractive.

Privacy is not just something between civilians, it is important between the government and the citizen as well.  

There is very little protection against abuse of government power as it is. The Comite P has very little power and is woefully underfunded. The privacy commission is 8 people strong. Both of these are appointed politically. 

Think back to the great Belgian firewall. It was introduced to fight child porn. Who could be against it? But it was immediately abused to block other sites, and it's now being used to block torrent websites. Do we have a list of websites they block? No, of course not. The moment they had the tool in place, they immediately abused it. 

What if they have information about your every move? How easy to introduce a kilometer tax. How easy to see who is always on the road during rush hour and could face a rush hour tax.

devonclaire,relationship_advice,1389725466.0,"It sounds like your wife wants more help from you, or wants more affection from and interaction with you.

From what you're saying, you leave your phone on for four hours a day. I understand not wanting to get calls all night, but if you're turning your phone off during the day when your wife wants/needs to reach you, then that probably makes her feel like you're shutting her out and making yourself unavailable emotionally.

Sorry OP, but I can definitely see where your wife is coming from. I'd be sad if I didn't hear from my husband all day long. If your wife is making constant requests or if she's sending you an unreasonable number of texts, that would be a different story, and I would say you would need to talk to her about limiting it. But this sounds more like she just wants you to be available occasionally. Most people with cell phones *are* available by text throughout the day. I consider it rude when someone doesn't respond to a text within a reasonable time frame, and it's even more rude when the person in question is your spouse.

Does your wife have any way to contact you if there *were* an emergency? If not, that's a big problem.

But mostly, I think your wife probably feels shut out in general. How is your relationship otherwise? I don't think it's unreasonable for your wife to call you during your commute home or send you a few texts throughout the day. I do it with my husband almost every day.

ShesGotSauce,NoStupidQuestions,1389725498.0,"I think you're correct, and admire your in-depth and genuine exploration of the subtle differences between these words :)

I would just want to reiterate that the terms are largely interchangeable in regular speech, especially for OP's purposes.  If you said, ""I met a huge jerk today"" it would be taken to mean essentially the same thing as if you said, ""I met a huge douchebag today.""  In either case, the person you were talking to would clearly understand that you met someone who did something nasty or obnoxious.

Douchebag is more crass; ""jerk"" could be used in even somewhat formal situations.  ""Douchebag"" would general be used among friends or in a casual setting."

use_more_lube,Flipping,1389725506.0,"There's a ton of stuff out there to flip, and the more people who are flipping the more info and opportunities there are. 

Here's one for you: have you been to an auction, recently? 
I work for an auctioneer, and the things that don't fit into our buyers' interests go cheap. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. 

I got a child-scale Victorian chair with new upholstery... which ruins the value for a collector.
 It's no longer a valuable antique, it's too small for most American adults, and the hammer price was $5.  

So I sold it on Craigslist for $40 as a ""Princess Chair"" and there's an ecstatic little girl who has the perfect accessory for her bedroom. 

That's almost $35 in my pocket for buying something at work and selling it the next week, and the chair itself weighs about 12 lbs.  

Ideas are easy, opportunities are common, diligence is where folks tend to fall down. 

Learn your niche, find where it's cheap, sell it for dear. 

Also, Auctions.  Just BE THERE, because shipping will absolutely kill you. Also, pay cash and understand that there's a buyer's premium that varies from auctioneer to auctioneer.

maowsers93,worldnews,1389725507.0,"I quite agree with everything you've said here. I also think that it is a plus that everyone is being equally exploited because there is less of a tendency to ignore it. When before the minorities were allowed to be used like a product the majority of the whites could enjoy their quality of life and pretend it wasn't happening. Now the 99% as you pointed out are being used as a resource while the 1% enjoy their quality of life and ignore it. Now what was the minority is the super majority which makes a big difference in the dynamic of change. 

I think one of the biggest problems we have moving forward is people's tendency to glitterize America's past. We like to be nostalgic and say ""oh things were so good back then"" or ""America used to be so free/liberated/etc"". America was never these things. 

One of the biggest things that grinds on my nerves is people's need to pretend that America started because of religious freedom. America didn't start off because of religious freedom, it started as a capital enterprise for the purpose of creating wealth. People certainly moved here seeking religious freedom (and in some case the ability to use their religion in an oppressive manner as was the case in many Massachusetts communities) but the way people got here and the reason why American colonies were sought out in the first place was through charters. Those charters had to be repaid and to do that the townships had to create a profitable commodity that could be traded by the various European countries that hosted them. 

America was founded by and for money not by and for people. People have historically been exploited in the United States because all of the Americas were founded off an economic model that required it. Slaves in the Caribbean had a 7 year life span, indentured servants could earn their freedom within 7 or so years but most didn't live that long, etc. etc. 

People have always had a shelf life like a product here and the sooner people drop the nostalgic Hallmark bullshit the faster we can change things. But to change things we will have to honestly look at one another an acknowledge that we will be revolutionizing what America is from the ground up. Until that we'll just see more of the same. "

The_British_One,LiverpoolFC,1389725717.0,"I think the top 4 will stay as is in terms of teams. I see arsenal slipping and City winning, Chelsea 2nd and us or Arsenal 3rd the other 4th. But honestly any of the top 4 could win. We have all of them at home and I think if we can make Anfield a fortress then we'll be right up there.

I'm not worried at all about United, Spurs or Everton and here's why:

* **United** - They're currently relying on Giggs and Januzaj. A 40 year old who peaked 13 years ago and an 18 year old who isn't as good as Sterling and has been gaining a reputation for diving. Their two main attacking threats are injured and won't be back until they have CL, when they'll be distracted and their squad thinned and tired. They won last year because it was SAF. Even though he's scum I have to give him credit, he took a mid-table squad with 2 stand out players and got them the title. Moyes can't do that because he's a mediocre manager. They will get 5th if they're lucky.

* **Spurs** - horribly inconsistent. Sherwood is decent and they've looked improved but I still think they'll struggle against top teams, as they did against Arsenal. They have supposedly a very good squad but they just haven't gelled and I don't see them doing it in time. Also Europe will take a lot out of their challenge. 

* **Everton** - Lack of depth and attacking threat will kill their challenge. Lukaku has been off the boil of late and without him they're very very average. Their squad is even thinner than ours and I just don't see them keeping up. 

Not to mention we have the easiest 2nd stretch of any of the top 7 teams. 

If we can beat our rivals at home then I really don't see any reason why we can't push as high as possible. "

So I want him knocked out of the playoffs so we can talk about something else.

Also, I am a Brady fan (Michigan man), so I want him to continue to assert his dominance as the better QB of the two.

Edit - was just reminded by turning on the TV of a reason that he actually provides for me to dislike him. All his stupid commercials...between Papa John's and his car commercials, I hate seeing his stupid face on my TV."

Offense. Matt's problems are his mechanics/decision makeing skills. He can improve, and I believe he will. But, not in the first season. We will struggle to score points in 2014. I can feel that now. But, if we hang in there, I believe, based on what Caldwell has been a part of in Indy and Baltimore, we could see some huge improvement in the offense. We may even get a new exciting new receiving talent on a diamond in rough type of guy. I.E. Pierre Garcon (6th round pick) or Marlon Brown (undrafted FA, 500 yds 7TDs last year as #3 receiver).

Gre3nArr0w,xboxone,1389726010.0,"To actually respond to this post, yes a lot of the people who rage are just teenagers but another reason is that gamers seem to be the most disrespected consumer in the whole entertainment industry.

Now you may ask yourself how is that? Look at it if i go see the next paranormal activity I get the full experience the movie wont crash on me or not finish or have problems its released as a finished product.

Now lets compare that to battlefield. The whole game is extremely broken, you can't even play the campaign, the game crashes constantly 3 months after release. yet people accept this and buy it because it happens regularly in the gaming industry. If this was any other portion of the entertainment industry this would be absolutely insane but it's not. this is the gaming industry and it's allowed to release unfinished products and have the creators say ""eh ill finish it later""

Also when I go to a movie im not told hey if you go to these different theaters you get different content. Or hey if you pay 10 dollars for your ticket for an extra 5 ill give you extra parts of the movie!

It doesn't work like that in every other part of the entertainment industry but in gaming it does and it's ridiculous. The movie industry gets more respected by its fans because they respect the fans more. The gaming industry's fans get treated like crap and in turn the creators get treated like crap."

But those 5 million additional rides are costing the city *$900 million*, serviced by debt, which is paid for by 30 years of property surtaxes. There is no way in hell that makes fiscal sense. 

Proximity counts. There will only be 24,000 people in walking distance of an extended subway station, vs 47,000 people for the LRT version. If people supposedly hate the transfer from the Scarborough RT to subway at Kennedy, we can't assume they would *like* the transfer from a less-frequent bus line to the subway extension."

ProllyNotYou,travel,1389726152.0,"I'm not a travel agent, hope that's ok, but I am planning a similar itinerary for our family in May, so I thought I would chime in. 

My best recommendation is to dig around www.flyertalk.com, it is a fantastic community of people that do this sort of thing for a living... The blogs at boardingarea.com are also full of information. 

Not sure about how to use Chase points, but you can use BA Avios to book your trip from Dublin to home on Aer Lingus as a Codeshare. Google it and you'll find lots of info about it. I wouldn't fly BA to London because they charge ridiculous carrier fees. You may be able to use Avios to book an American Airlines flight through BA without paying the BA fees, but we're actually flying American over to London so I don't know for sure. Our AA flight to London on AA metal will cost $5 each in taxes and fees vs. $260 each on a BA flight. 

And, just my two cents, I would recommend driving to Glasgow instead of taking the train, if you think you can handle driving on the left. My husband and I did that last year, and it was the most enjoyable part of our entire two week trip. We were able to see a lot more of the ""normal"" parts of the UK, and on a train you'd miss quite a bit.

I think that when there are such strong societal pressures on women to beautiful (something that neither red nor blue pill denies) women don't want to be forever remembered as a bloody mess. 

There is something manly about going out with a bang. But it also looks like guns have more to do with the fact that men are more likely to own guns in general. 

I think that exploring the motivations would be really interesting. But the most important thing to take away from this I think is that men aren't more likely to commit suicide from women.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1389726183.0,"&gt; Then you don't understand Libertarianism at all. Sure, there will always be tin-foil hatters, but the majority of Libertarians understand that the Government is the way it is because people think they are trying to help people. We understand that the ""point"" of Government rules is to make things better, we just realize that in practice, they make things worse, regardless of how well intentioned the instigator of the rules was.

Except in my experience they don't.

For example, I once had a libertarian discuss all these bureaucratic zoning laws that prevent people from having gardens on their land. I research their issues, and it has to do with vegetative cover being gone to have these gardens. Having spent a semester in grad school working on a steep slope ordinance and researching the issues surrounding the need for vegetative cover, I can tell you those restrictions were put in place to reduce soil erosion and runoff. But libertarians don't see that. They don't look at the environmental reasons behind these rules. They just see ""I can't garden in my back yard and I want FREEDOM!!""

Government isn't perfect. But the solution isn't to get the government out of our lives, it's to pass better laws. Which is why I'm for UBI. It's a superior alternative to what we have now.

&gt;It is not anecdotal, it applies to EVERY person whose value to an employer is less than minimum wage. I just pointed out one example of how that, in real life, would play out, since you don't seem to understand the concept that employees all have actual, real world, dollar amount worth to their employers.

And for a lot of people, [their current jobs would be worth a lot less than they are now.](http://wwac.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Chris-Rock-on-Minimum-Wage-634x441.jpg)

Seriously, a lot of jobs, they only pay the amount they can because they HAVE to. If they could pay half as much, they would in a heart beat, and the minimum wage is the only thing stopping them.

Look, you're not convincing me, and this is why I am reluctant to have this discussion any more. Every time I end up having a discussion on the minimum wage I always have libertarians inundating me with their ""what ifs"" and ideological arguments about the free market I don't agree with. I understand some jobs are lost with the minimum wage, but in a UBI economy, the quantity of jobs will not be an immediate concern because a portion of people will likely leave the work force and live on UBI. It's seriously not a concern if we will more or less reach full employment anyway. Lowering the wage will hurt more, because a lot of people making $7.25 would be forced to work for less or be fired/replaced with someone who will. "

* **Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader**

 * If you ever wanted to know the complete story of North Korea, this is it. By far the most comprehensive book about North Korea there is. Details from the earliest origins of the Soviet Union selecting Kim Il Sung to be the leader of the country, the 'glory days' of the 1960s-1970s, the collapse of the early 1990s after the chief sponsor state the Soviet Union itself collapsed, Kim Il Sung growing concerned about the death of his dictator buddy Ceacescu in Romania, Kim Il Sung resolving to build nuclear weapons after he saw how easily the US/West destroyed the Iraqi Army in the Gulf War, grooming Kim Jong Il to take power for over twenty years, Kim Jong Il taking power in the first communist dynastic succession in world history, Kim Jong Il's rein of terror and the Arduous March of the middle 1990s (~1994).

* **The Cleanest Race**
 * About North Korean propaganda and how it relates to the North Korean government's official perception of domestic and foreign affairs. Very interesting, makes a strong case that North Korea has long abandoned communism (in fact it has entirely dropped any reference to communism in its constitution), and is more akin to old fascist Imperial Japan than anything else. **If you are trying to get into North Korea books, this is a great place to start along with Escape From Camp 14.**

* **Aquariums of Pyongyang**

 * About a young boy -&gt; man growing up in Yodok concentration camp. Much unpleasantness, such as tilling burial grounds for more arable crop space only to unearth freshly decomposing body parts. Author eventually is released and escapes, meets with George W. at the White House.

* **The Impossible State**

 * Details many of the facts that make it hard to believe North Korea exists, along with painstaking detail on the numerous agreements North Korea &amp; the world have signed over the years and how North Korea has almost always broken them. Note: author has a bit of a pro-Bush bias that is discernible, but the book is still worthwhile.

* **Escape From Camp 14**

 * By the subject of this thread, Shin Dong-Hyuk, who was born in an 'irredeemable' work camp as the product of guard-allowed communal sex for 'good behavior' of his parents. Never was close to either of his parents. At the age of six, he began working in the adjacent coal-mines. Starved his entire childhood (vividly recalls fighting with children over a piece of semi-digested corn found in cow-dung). Mom got raped by camp guards. Saw dad once a year. He routinely caught and cooked rats over fire (when possible to cook it, that is). He escapes one day, and you know what his motivation was? His cellmate while he was getting tortured told him about barbecue food in the outside world, and he desired so badly to taste real food. That's why he decided to escape.

 * *(SPOILER ALERT: eventually he betrays his mother and brother to the guards (he was jealous that they had stored rice for an escape that he didn't get to have), as they were more like parents than anything else he had, both of them get executed in front of him, mom by hanging and brother by firing squad. Also he gets his dad tortured. Also he himself gets tortured over a fire like a pig among other various mechanisms of torture for seven months, FOR RATTING OUT HIS MOTHER AND BROTHER I MIGHT ADD).* 

 * There's a lot of other terrible, unspeakable things in here (charred corpses on electrical fences come to mind). To date he is the only person to escape this level of camp having been born in one. He was literally born to be a life-long disposable slave of the Korean Communist Party.

* **Nothing to Envy**

 * About 5ish separate groups of defectors and how they came to learn of the outside world while inside North Korea and eventually made the decision to escape. Fascinating."

The town was very urban infrastructure. It was stressful and not much fun.

However, that trail system runs all the way to Monument, and then you can take Rt. 105 from there to Palmer Lake and then all the way to Denver. There's even a campground just south of Denver with power outlets. 

Rt. 105 and the Cherry Creek trail was the best part of my trip.

As far as heading east across to Pueblo, I would adjust to go east right into Colorado Springs because there is nothing south of there for cyclists. It's kind of a shame, actually; most of Colorado is just empty east of the Rockies. 

I used Hwy 94 and resources were few and far between. if you're not covering at least 50 miles a day, you'll need a lot of supplies. We used 94 for the full 95-mile ""No Services"" stretch and it was just okay."

beware_of_hamsters,trees,1389726431.0,"This is probably a bit unpopular, but I think if you're only getting by with £20 bags, you shouldn't even smoke (regularly enough to warrant your own grow-op) at all. Either you're broke as fuck or you need it so much you can't possibly wait a month or two to get your next sack. Or you're living at home, in which case you shouldn't even think about growing at all.

I'd just stop smoking until you can at least afford half an oz. You just get more out of your money, and thus you can save money more easily(that is, if you don't suddenly start smoking more just because you have more).

Saving up enough for my first grow took me half a year, I started reading up about it a full year before, though. First 6 months was basically ""Eh, it would be pretty cool, I guess? Man, these plants *are* pretty cool looking. It's gotta be nice to see them growing with your own eyes and stuff"" while looking at a few grows occasionally, and after 6 months of this, I basically said ""Fuck it, I'm gonna do this shit now"", read up upon *everything* I could get my hands/eyes on, decided what components to buy, and did it. And it went absolutely great.

I didn't smoke often in that time, though. And I looked at it as an investion into my future finances. I know I'm not going to stop smoking anytime soon, so I know I'll have a somewhat constant need for weed. I could buy 3 ounces a year for like 700€(yeah, I'm not even smoking that much), or I could invest 700€ into my grow set-up **once**(including seeds, set-up and running costs) and reap benefits from that for a few years. I got 4 oz on my first run, so even one ounce more than if I would've bought it. Every ~4-6oz after that is ~100€ for me(seeds&amp;running costs)."

trennerdios,AskReddit,1389726439.0,"I love my parents, and I've had a better relationship with them ever since I moved out of their house 10 years ago. That being said, the one beef I still have with their parenting is how they handled my trouble with grades in middle school, and even more so in high school. They had the same expectations of me that they had of my sister, even though she had no problems being motivated and doing her work, or paying attention in class. I would get bad grades, they'd ground me from TV and video games until my grades improved. My grades would improve just enough to get my privileges back, and then the cycle would happen again. There was never any positive reinforcement, only negative consequences. For a long time I blamed only myself for being stupid enough to waste money going to college and flunking out after barely graduating high school, but I recently realized that they are just as much to blame for it. Why they thought I would suddenly start doing better in an environment where I had absolutely no supervision is beyond me.


The last couple of years I was starting to have a really hard time concentrating at work and finishing all my tasks on time, so I finally took matters into my own hands and went to the doctor because I realized I couldn't just chalk it all up to laziness. At age 30 I was diagnosed with ADHD and I'm now on medication and I'm doing much, much better at work. 


I don't want to have new resentment for my parents, especially for things that happened in the past that can't be fixed now, but I can't help but think about where I would be now if they had tried to get me real help. I still resent the constant groundings that accomplished nothing, and the unreasonable expectations they had. They should have realized my sister and I were very different people, and holding us to the same standards made no sense. Sometimes I want to yell at them for it, but I know it would be pointless, and wouldn't do me or them any good."

From chapter 5:
http://www.aa.org/bigbookonline/en_bigbook_chapt5.pdf

&gt;Remember that we deal with alcohol—cunning, baffling, powerful! Without help it is too much for us. But there is One who has all power—that One is God.
May you find Him now!
Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the
turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon.
Here are the steps we took, which are suggested as a program of recovery:

&gt;1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol— that our lives had become unmanageable..
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than our­ selves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory
of ourselves.
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another
human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all
these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and
became willing to make amends to them all.
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure
them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when
we were wrong promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to im­prove our conscious contact with God as we un­derstood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs."

Ch 6 and slip stitch to form ring. 


Ch 3 (counts as first dc) dc 15 into ring. (16 dc)

Change colors, ch 3 into a ch 1 space(counts as first dc), dc2 into same space. Dc 3 into each ch 1 space. Slip stitch to join. (48 dc)


(I don't really know how to write this part in pattern speak so it'll be a mix, I'm sorry. It's also redundant. Again, I'm sorry.)

Ch 1 (counts as first sc) into a space between dcs. Ch 3, sc into the space 3 dcs from the first sc. Ch 3, sc into the space 3 dcs from the second sc. Ch 3, sc into the space 3 dcs from the third sc. Ch 3, sc into the space 3 dcs from the fourth sc. Ch 7 and sc into the SAME space. Repeat around and sl st to join. 


...Shit. This next row is where it goes to shit. 


SO after sl st to join, it looks like a sc into the sc (but all the other scs should be into a space not a stitch. That first one is the only sc that looks like it's in a stitch instead of a space. You may want to just sc into the first ch 3 space). 4 dc into the ch 3 space. Ch 1 and 4 dc into next ch 3 space. Sc 1 into third ch3 space. 

In the ch 7 loopie thing, dc 6, ch 2, dc 6. Repeat the whole thing around, sl st to join. 


Join the new color to the last dc on one of the corners, Ch 6 (counts as first dc + ch 3). Sc into the ch 1 space. Ch 3, dc into the space between the 4th dc and the sc. Ch 5. In the ch 2 space of the corner, work sc 1, ch 3, sc 1. Chain 5, dc into the space between the sc and dc. Ch 3, sc 1 into the ch 1 space. Repeat the pattern around.


Work 4 dc into the ch 3 spaces, and 6 dc into the ch 5 spaces.

For the corners, work dc 1, ch 1, dc 1.

maowsers93,TumblrInAction,1389726579.0,"They don't release any statements publicly against the SJW's because they're afraid of their reactions. They reassess their directions as they show up i.e telling everyone to wear a certain color to show clear affiliation, telling everyone to meet in a certain place, telling people to steer clear of particular areas, etc. 

They are largely afraid of releasing public statements about them for a number of reasons. The first one is the most obvious one which is if they do the SJW's will turn around and scream about how they're being oppressed. The second one is because they want to reduce the amount of attention between themselves and the SJW's. Another is because they don't want to alienate anyone who might want to work with the group in the future. They take a be nice and stay quite approach which clearly makes them widely unknown but I think is the professional approach. 
 
The SJW's I've been in contact with largely aren't affiliated with anyone or any group. They usually act as loosely affiliated individuals and make absurd demands. When they aren't meet they make large public announcements about being oppressed in various ways. An example I can think of is when the groups I previously listed decided to work with the Texas Dems to make a pro-choice gathering at the capital last summer with speakers from PP, Legislators, and a few musical guests they demanded to be able to speak. I mean, seriously there were like 3,000 people there to see people like Sen. Wendy Davis speak, no one cares what Joe Shmoe who'd done literally nothing to get us to the point where we were has to say. They wanted some public forum and when they didn't get it they put out all these articles about how the Texas Democrats were oppressing them. It is extremely maddening. 

This of course is just going off my experiences working with these groups in my particular location. You may find public announcements stating no affiliation with other groups. "

You're a therapist, and I'm just a schmuck who read a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Shyness-Love-Causes-Consequences-Treatment/dp/0819161020). But the book said that it's common for therapists to give this advice: work on yourself first; a relationship will not solve all your problems. For a certain subset of people, namely males of a certain age who've never been in a relationship and want to be in one, that is literally their number one problem. They can't work on anything else because it preoccupies their psyche. It's a bit of a tangent since this thread is about insecure girls in relationships, but I wonder what you think about that.

silverionmox,changemyview,1389726710.0,"&gt; I am not sure what time period you are referring to when you say they didn't devalue national currency.

What they didn't do was *export their way out of trouble*. They haven't built a strong export economy in half a century of unprecedented peace and prosperity; clearly, there's more to it than having a separate currency. It's not a panacea, it just trades some option for others.

&gt;they can be expensive, and sometimes aren't the best way to do things.

I don't see how that is different for issues in any political entity.

&gt;The EU is good for the man on the street, usually, when it comes to dealing with changes across Europe. However there is still the problems the EU faces from having to accommodate all the individual states when searching for common policies. This usually means many rewritten attempts, and a huge number of extra qualifications. Just compare the size of the EU constitution to that of the US. 15 times the size.

I consider the EU constitution a work in progress. And at least we don't have to interpret words from centuries ago as if they were clairvoyant. A constitution is a useful guideline that's open for adaptation, not the Truth.

&gt;Trading blocs are a thing that exist. And free trade does not need political union. Aside from that just look at who each country trade with. Here &amp; here we see that the UK does over 50% of its trading with just 7 countries. Granted most are European, but these countries have the roughly same ratio. They aren't going to sacrifice such a market.

And neither will the UK. So who will have the most bargaining power in such a situation?

&gt;Strange that you say keeping national government strong is less democratic that increasing the power of a superstate.

My point is that people who are very quick to decry the ""undemocratic nature"" of the EU are very slow to support power to be moved from the heads of executive power of the states to the European Parliament."

/r/Feminism is actually one of the better social justice subs, and I'm one of those who is already weary of overly-PC pomoism. 

For a sub that ""doesn't really talk about anything"" they have a lot of content. From spending 5 seconds glancing at the thread topics there right now, I found discussions on:

- tech's gender and race gap
- African feminist theology
- an introspective thread ""Think about your words"" / self-critique (how fucking rare is that in a political sub)
- a post about Saudi women

and so on.

Sort by top comments, and you see the same pattern.  A lot of introspection and some stuff about abortion.

The last time I saw any major drama there, it was because the mods there were being accused by some of the more radical members of being in support of the MRM. The mods basically came out and said [paraphrasing]: *""Yeah, that's right, and there's nothing wrong with that. Gender equality. woohoo.""* 

If it sounds like they don't talk about enough, maybe it's because they don't bitch as much as most political subs.

It has nothing to do with getting the dolphin to like it.  The question is why do dolphins have a physical mechanism that allows them to drink at all, given that they don't drink in the wild.

I have some questions if that's ok... How do you seperate the sexual from the nude? For example, your parents must still be intimate, and I guess you have partners, so how do you distinguish 'normal' naked and 'sex' naked?

How do you deal with personal hygiene issues such as tampons/periods and things like pubic waxing? Are you all quite bohemian when it comes to body hair? What about things like tattoos &amp; piercings?

Would you expect a partner or SO to join the family attitude, or do you put clothes on when visitors come round?

and last of all... As a big-boobed girl, I can't imagine bouncing around the house with no bra on. I only ask because I literally just took mine off &amp; had to support myself coming down the stairs, and I get backache without a bra. Do you have similar issues?

mmp31,politics,1389726944.0,"&gt;again, you are contradicting yourself. if i give that person $500 cash, aren't they more likely to spend that money on illegal stuff than if i gave them the voucher for $500? according to that logic, we shouldn't be giving welfare at all. 

How is that my logic?

&gt;you're right, if people are gonna abuse the system, they are gonna abuse it. but there are people that would abuse it if it were easier to do so. i'd much rather make it harder to do so than easier to do so.

Now that depends on how you define ""abuse"".  Would you say that people who are using food stamps to buy coffee, which has a drug like caffeine in it, are abusing the system?  They are buying drugs with their welfare money, afterall.  

It seems to me like the only thing you're concerned about is that they are spending their money on *illegal* things, not necessarily things that they need to survive. If that's the case, legalize all drugs and prostitution.  Problem solved.

&gt;also, as an aside, research has been done on SNAP and a very small % of it is actually used in the sense you mentioned (trading for drugs or sex).

Please provide a source to back up this claim.

&gt;nope, just that they can buy food. you can always buy more or less if you so choose and you can buy whatever food you want.

Unless of course the food you're talking about are vitamins, wine, hot food, or food that will be eaten in the store.http://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items

Whether you like it or not, the system you advocate is already determining what sorts of food and drugs are ""bad"" and what sort of food and drugs are ""good"" for people to eat by regulating what foods and drugs you can buy with food stamps.  You can't buy food such as wine because it has a drug like alcohol in it, but you can buy food such as coffee even though it has a drug like caffeine in it. 

These are the sorts of blatant illogical hypocrisies you run into when you have the government dictating what the poor can and can't spend their welfare money on.  These things are a lot more sophisticated that you are lead to believe.

&gt;nope, just that this is how much money you should spend on insurance. you can always spend more or less if you so choose and can purchase whatever plan you like. 

If the gov't allocates $400 towards insurance, how can you spend more than $400 on a plan?

&gt;are you not a fan of medicaid? b/c that's a one-size-fits-all deal. 

No, I'm a fan of the Negative Income Tax system replacing all welfare.

&gt;nope, i've already said that would be a terrible idea. its creating a solution for a problem that doesn't exist.

If drug abuse isn't a problem now, then what makes you think it will be a problem under a Negative Income Tax System?

&gt;....?????? all the govt is doing is trying to put poor people in a position to succeed (this is the main reason they probably are in poverty in the first place). pretend i have a friend named jim who is poor and needs money. i, being the govt, give jim some money to help him get back on his feet. i give him a $100 gift card every month that i tell him only can be used on food. jim still has plenty of choices to make with that $100, it just has to be spent on food. i give him $400/month to buy insurance. he can still choose whatever plan he wants and can spend more or less.

How can Jim spend more than $400 on insurance if you only gave him $400 for insurance?

&gt; i give him $700/month for rent and tell him that he can only live in certain places. he still can choose where and what he puts in the apartment. 

How can Jim choose where the apartment is if you tell him he only can live in certain places?  At least with a Negative Income Tax system, the poor would have the choice of being able to not live in a cockroach infested ghetto.

&gt;this is simply a guiding process and not a dictatorship.

I disagree with your opinion.  We're already telling the poor where they can and can't spend their welfare money to live, and what sort of food and drugs they can and can't spend their money on. Sounds pretty dictatorial to me.

&gt;like i said, i think it should be brought to the table as an idea. individuality and independence are very subjective ideas and don't equate to success in an economy. the govt doesn't know why you ended up in poverty. but, all its trying to do is put you in a position to succeed. i think i've laid out that you lose some of it, but its only helpful (not harmful) in getting people out of poverty (the #1 goal). even so, maybe thats motivation to climb the economic ladder (so you don't have to rely on govt assistance and can do it on your own).

&gt;but motivation to climb the ladder is important. the problem when you give people a universal basic income is that they are gonna choose and be happy with how they spend it. so, if they are enjoying life with the money they get where would there be motivation to climb the ladder? i understand that programs like SNAP are kind of hand holding. but, that is the motivation to climb the ladder.

This is exactly the sort of nonsense I'm talking about.  I don't believe that welfare should be designed to make the poor unhappy and not enjoy life. People who are unhappy and don't enjoy life are depressed and have little motivation to do move up in life.  So thanks for proving my point that the ""babying"" welfare system you support is designed to guilt and shame the poor.  The motivation to climb the ladder is higher under a negative income tax system because they won't reach a certain point where they will immediately lose their benefits.  They'll be gradually weaned off it.

So I disagree with your opinions for reasons previously stated.  I've highlighted why our current ""all or nothing"" welfare system kills the incentive to climb the ladder."

That's because the TTC is under-funded by City Council and wasn't able to purchase enough streetcars to provide a 1:1 replacement. We should still see a slight capacity increase if the TTC can ever figure out this ""competent route management"" concept.

&gt; and require stops to be removed.

Because the LFLRVs are so long it doesn't make sense to stop so often. For example, the westbound Queen/York stop is slated to be deleted, if I remember correctly. The immediately following stop, Queen/University, is [120 metres away](http://goo.gl/maps/RyBRk). When the LFLRV itself is 30 metres long, you can walk to the back door in less than a minute (remember, LFLRVs will be all-door loading!). Why bother stopping twice in such a short distance?

If there's a way for you to update your medical history and remain anonymous, in case of new discoveries in your medical background, that would be wonderful.

einTier,cars,1389727374.0,"Insurance companies are legally obligated to make you whole.  That means that after an incident, they must put you back where you were, minus your deductible, or *better*.  

Most people don't know this and settle for less than they're owed because ""that's all we're going to get anyway.""   The insurance company isn't your friend and they're going to try to get away with paying as little as possible.  You have to know what you're owed and what will set you back right.  Unfortunately, this is a subjective thing.  However, if you push it, judges, juries, and everyone else are all much more sympathetic to the little guy than the big corporate behemoth.  Too many feel they were screwed over themselves at some point and here is an opportunity to give it back. 

What I'm saying is that you can't be *unreasonable*, but you definitely can say that every car they present isn't ""equal"".  That's why insurance companies will pay enough to get you a very similar car but a little newer and with less miles.  It's difficult to say that's not undeniably better than the destroyed property.   In this case, it sounds like the majority of people here think replacing the totalled 2012 with a brand new 2014 is reasonable, so that would likely stand up in court if the owner pushed it.  "

ninety6days,changemyview,1389727637.0,"&gt;Here's what is canon. Fett was highly respected enough to be brought in along with a very small group of bounty hunters for a personal audience with Darth Vader. During this meeting, his reputation was such that Vader spoke to him individually about his tendencies, implying that his reputation extends all the way to Vader. He was then given a specific job, and then executed it to perfection almost immediately. You can argue that it wasn't flashy or ""impressive"", but it was exactly what he was hired to do. He's a professional with a reputation for results. This is further reinforced by his standing in jabbas entourage. Again, not only is he recognized by a notorious gangster for his body of work, but he gets the job done, bringing solo to jabba alive, again living up to his implied reputation in terms of being a professional who gets the job done.
As for his dopey demise at the sarlaac pit, that says more about the dubious action directing than it does about him. Star wars canon explicitly says that stormtroopers are extremely accurate and precise. Yet when confronted by ""main character defensive magic"", they always miss. These missed shots, along with boba fetts blunder, are silly movie tropes that appear in shoddy action scenes, and shouldn't be taken to have wider canon implications, as opposed to his strongly implied and demonstrated record of competence from the rest of the script.

Find a bar with lots of variety and a liquor store with tons of beers (BevMo usually has a good variety), and start tasting. Read about beer, and try to brew a batch of your own.

infamousboone,Coachella,1389727875.0,"Sunday night of 2012. My good friend, that is a girl (i am a guy), and I were sitting next to our campsite in a couple of camping chairs just watching people stumble back to their camps and talking about all the good shows we saw. It was getting really late (4am-ish) but we weren't really all that tired. Nobody was walking around anymore and the campgrounds were really quiet, very cool setting. 

Well, out of nowhere the shirtless big guy comes stumbling through our campsite and sees us. He Immediately spots us, looks at me, looks at the girl. When he sees the girl his eyes kind of light up and he makes a b-line for  her. I had no idea what his intentions were but he did not look to be all there and was moving towards he in way that spelled trouble to me. 

I jumped up out of my chair between her and him just as he got close. I am big guy myself and was not intimidated by him. But as he began talking I did worry about what was going to happen. He began rambling about my friend and I gathered he was inquiring whether or not she was mine. As the conversation progressed he began getting more and more excited and amplified. I did my best to play along while telling him he should go find his camp. But he wouldn't leave. At one point I thought it was going to turn into a real fight because he was getting somewhat aggressive and in my face. Eventually I ended up ""helping"" him walk away to what he thought was his campsite.

It really wasn't that crazy of a situation, I have had crazier times at Coachella. But this came really close to being really bad.

From my comment below. These aren't decisions that someone makes or can clearly be pointed out as responsible for. And it's the companies fault for not having people to make sure things like this don't happen, but there's no specific individual that can be blamed for not making that happen either. Because if a CEO was to make something like that happen without companies being punished when they fuck up, that CEO is going to be replaced, because a department like that isn't needed from a shareholder perspective.

pigeonburger,anime,1389727946.0,"Seems like a rather weak season. If it wasn't for Silver Spoon and Log Horizon continuing, I wouldn't have much to watch.

Anyway, from those I've seen...

**ImoCho** - Went too far, too quickly. I don't mind reprehensible stuff usually, but borderline-H with definitely underage characters masturbating right on ""camera""; that's where I draw the line. Since the very premise of the show seems to be *made* to encourage this sort of stuff happening, I'm not going to be watching this one anymore.

**Saitokai Yaukindomo** - I don't get the humor. Vulgarity can be funny when in the context of a **good** joke, but running around yelling ""pussy! ass! cock! hymen! dildo!"" isn't funny by itself, even if it's girls saying these things. Not going to watch this one.

**Tonari no Seki-kun** - Now *that* was good! Seki is the Batman of time-wasting. I can't wait to see what he'll be doing next.

**Engaged to the Unidentified** - I don't hate the idea, but I didn't like the pacing of the first episode. Seems like they rushed through the setup of the situation to jump as quickly as possible to the introduction of new characters. I hope they won't have this habit of foregoing plot development in favor of **moar characters**.

**Wizard Barristers** - I love the premise, but at this point, there's not enough lawyering. Hopefully they'll get to that next episode. Love the art as well.

jaynay1,leagueoflegends,1389727951.0,"Eh?  While Gambit's comp is full of individually strong picks, it has virtually no damage past 20 minutes.  

Honestly Fnatic picked much better, even if Gambit took all the FotM's.

Like look at it this way:  How is Gambit going to win the game?  They'd have to basically kill Jinx/Ori and then there would be a pillow fight against Trundle/Vi.  This would require Alex being insanely ahead, which their comp didn't allow for.  Otherwise you aren't getting through Tibbers counterengage/Ori shield/Trundle Pillar.

Further, Trundle Pillar just does silly things to Shyvana/Mundo to start with.  They basically can't do much around it but eat it.

Not only that, but just looking at individual matchups:

Mundo v. Trundle:  Mundo has to farm with Cleavers because he can't really fight.  Trundle builds BotRK and then Mundo really can't fight.  Then teamfights happen and Pillar just takes Mundo out of it.

Leblanc v. Ori:  Ori shoves lane, and Leblanc can't respond because shield keeps Ori from dying 1v1.  Leblanc requires jungle pressure to keep up.  This couldn't be provided so Leblanc was forced to go Athene's.

Thresh v. Annie:  Most pros have said this is in Annie's favor, and it's heavily because of the consistency of Annie's stun onto the AD Carry in lane, followed by more damage from Annie.

Lucian v. Jinx:  Lucian is a lane bully, but Jinx is able to not be bullied due to equal damage from her skills.  Jinx, though, scales much, much better than Lucian into late game and also is very good at clearing waves.

Finally in the jungle, Shyv can push Vi around 1v1, but when you start forcing Shyv to go to lanes because all of them are losing, she's not that good, and Vi can become the extremely strong diver that she has to be.

So by the end of it, picks and bans really favored Fnatic, heavily."

I was like ""uhhh...so some of this could be made up, though, right?"" He didn't have a good answer for that. 

It was later, when my church told me that I must discriminate and judge people for any beliefs that fall outside the church's teachings that I finally said ""I'm done with this house of lies.""  Which I probably would have swallowed had I not read the rambling, psychopathic ball of WTF-ery that is the Bible."

loserbum3,truegaming,1389728091.0,"There's a difference between what you are told about characters, and what they actually are and do.

There more meaningful thing to talk about is what characteristics affect what they do. Mario saving Peach and getting a kiss at the end is a very different story than Mario saving Luigi, or Yoshi transporting baby Mario. Gordon's interactions with Alyx are strongly colored by the implications of their attraction toward each other (or at least Alyx's, since Gordon is a really boring character).

Bad tubes can be replaced relatively easily, but what about transistors that go bad?  You'd end up spending a lot more to get them repaired than you would buying a new set of tubes.

So you're saying that after all of the labor that is involved with engineering a perfect modeller of a specific tube amp, plus the cost of physically building it, that it would be cheaper than simply engineering and building the real thing?  I find that hard to believe, because not only do you have to engineer the tube amp itself, but you also have to add the costs of engineering the modelling.

True independent thinking and living by your own code is a great thing.  You should try it. 

Parroting...  *Maybe* if a bunch of people are saying the same thing, it might be because there is some truth to it.  I realize that you feel like you are somehow intellectually superior to the *other* vegans on here.  You are truly embarrassing yourself. 

It is sad that you can't follow a logical train of thought.  It *is* crazy that people are proud of doing a bad thing (eating meat) but not crazy that people are proud of doing a good thing (not eating meat).  Get it?  

Yes, I refer to people as hypocrites that are hypocrites.  Why would that be a problem?  Of course he believes what he is saying, that is what makes someone a hypocrite and not a liar.  I mean, look up words if they are unfamiliar to you. 

And a hint: a good indication that your argument holds no weight is that you are reduced to made-up insults:

&gt; tear it down from your mom's basement

Ha, more of that independent, critical thinking of yours, *brah.* Nothing like a generic 4chan ""comeback"" at all.  Let me save you time: ""You mad, bro?"" 

And again, who said anything about belonging to a group?  Read words please.  There is a moral superiority to actions.  Yeah, and my first world carbon foot print is a hell of a lot better then all of my peers in the first world.  Tell me when you move to a third world country.  And if we would stick to the statement *I* made was that it is ridiculous when meat eaters are proud about eating meat.  You are the one who brought up being proud about veggies.

Now lets move on to the next problem with your statement/hypothesis - you're claiming that they do not in fact have the same problem and I'm not buying that. If they need funding, and this was the crux of my post's, then they can't upset those in power. If they don't need funding, then it doesn't matter what they say/publish/propose as they have nothing to be held over their heads.

highstead,Fitness,1389728248.0,"I am personally using the fitbit force.  It tracks: steps, stairs, sleep, 'calories', 'distance'.  Where the later two i suspect are extrapolated from steps, height, weight etc.

The alarm, and sleep tracking are particularly useful things that I really hadn't considered.  

Sleep monitoring is as simple as pressing and holding the button on the side before you go to sleep and again when you wake up.  If you forget to log it you can still go back and add it later and due to the nature of keeping the accelerometer readings it will still give you an 'accurate' dipiction of if you were restless or actually asleep.  To me this is actually the more interesting feature.

The manual logging of food is particularly cumbersome and as a result i typically don't do it.  Their food database although rather large is not fine tuned enough to make it easy for me to enter generic food.  At the end of the day all i want is an approximation.  If i ate only a foods this might be okay because you can customise your own foods.

Water is easy enough to do, android, ios and web support is pretty solid.

The steps seem reasonably accurate.  The 'flights of stairs' being tracked seems a bit more questionable.  Especially because I pace in elevators and i'm on the 22nd floor.   It also seems to assume stairs on inclines.  I'm not sure thats such a bad thing but it's interesting.

TheRosesAndGuns,sex,1389728256.0,"I dunno what's worse, the fact that your mom offered to buy her 15 year old daughter a butt plug and discusses her anal sex with you, or that your parents are happily having sex around the house when you have 11 year old and 9 year old siblings that could walk in at any time.

There's being open about sex and being exhibitionist and, quite frankly, crossing a very important line.

I'd just tell her that you're finding her openness a bit too much and it's disturbing you. Make the point that you still want to be able to talk to her about it, but you don't want details and you certainly don't want her to buy you sex toys. Explain that it's not just you who could walk in to see her and your father having sex and to make sure that your younger siblings aren't seeing all of this too."

Prancemaster,SquaredCircle,1389728336.0,"1) They're Samoan wrestlers. Facepaint is traditional with Samoan wrestlers. it's also only partial facepaint. People don't seem to have any problem with guys with facepaint not being able to connect with an audience as some of the most popular guys ever like Sting, Goldust and the Ultimate Warrior wear facepaint and they never have a problem. Given the size of the audience and the distance that many people are from the action, body movements are much more important than facial expressions and it's irrelevant for the at-home audience because the camera tends to get right in the guys' face. 

2) I feel the opposite on this. The entrance should be reserved for major matches so that it lends importance to the match. I'd be fine with them doing like they did in a six-man tag match where they did the dance before, then the pyro then the music was their partner's music. Huge pop! 

3) The announcers are dumb sometimes. Jimmy's makeup is always on the right side of his face and Jey's is always on the left.

BUG:

I cannot reproduce this, could you send me steps to reproduce and a crash log?(I believe the app asks you to send a crash report if it dies)

OMISSIONS:

- No option to keep the Android device from shutting down during play.

This is actually enabled by default, there simply isn't a setting shown to toggle it :)

- Sounds

I'll propably add sounds. Some people seemed sceptical to the idea so i'll disable them by default.

- Version number

This is coming :)

SUGGESTIONS:

Many people have asked for standard tournament controls, so i'll add this in a future release.

Regarding the descriptive text, i think people who are new to chess or play casually might have issues understanding the names.


Other additions:

Regarding quick way to reset the clock. You used to be able to long press the clock to pause -&gt; stop -&gt; reset, but it offered low affordance, and users found this confusing, so it was removed. An alternative is to allow the user to disable the ""are you sure you want to reset"" dialog.

Quick nod:  
1. Net Neutrality means that our ISPs are supposed to be infrastructure, not content regulators. They shouldn't be able to charge people for speaking, or for speaking a certain way.  
2. Immediate: No net neutrality in home ISPs. Verizon and others are slowly going to start messing around until the FCC fixes it. Long term: Depends if the FCC or congress ever decides to fix it. I imagine we won't see new businesses on the internet competing with the likes of Netflix and such.  
3. No, but it can be brought back. The decision went the way it did because the FCC was fucking around with classifications, and didn't call ISPs Telecommunications companies, even though it has to to be able to regulate them in the first place. All the FCC has to do is to rewrite its rules, and everything should be hunky-dory.

Griemak,Fitness,1389728519.0,"It isn't.  $100 a month for 80% coverage and a $5,000 deductible is not affordable if you actually USE IT.  The insurance itself is not $100 per month, it is $400-600.  The less money you make, the more discounts (subsidies, the tax payers pay the difference to the insurance companies) you get.  So to get $100 per month, you are way down near the poverty level (17-18K per year).  So you fork over the $100 per month which is ~6% of your monthly income... not too bad I suppose!  80% coverage of a broken arm means you get a bill for $5,000 (the deductible) and another $2,500 on average for casting, imaging, follow-ups and orthopedic evaluations over 3-4 visits.  That's 6% for this insurance and you still owe 41% of your yearly income for that broken arm... WITH INSURANCE.

It is better to go part time and shed off a few hours (lower your pay) to qualify for medicaid if you are close to the poverty line.  For the short term, it will be a race to the bottom for those who are sick.

OR

Comes as heralds of the Ruinous Powers. Offer salvation (Nurgle), vengeance for lost loved ones (Khorne), ascendancy over other humans who come to pay their respects for being saved (Tzeench), and a new era of beauty, indulgence, and prosperity in the wake of their victory over the xenos invaders (Slaanesh). Turn the population to the service of Chaos, and then remain on-world to defend the planet from the invasion.

Perhaps give the PCs an opportunity to appeal to the Chaos Gods for aid and backup. The Chaos Gods will be interested, since they potentially gain a whole planet of resources and souls if the battle is successful.

If the PCs win, their infamy skyrockets. They are planetary conquerors, and have given their dark patrons a foothold in the Materium.

About 3100 sounds like it could work, you might be a bit more active than I am. I've actually been gaining a hair over a pound a week myself on a 2700 calorie diet. I started at 135 myself. 

Just want to point out that most people you ask are going to agree that at the MAX you can put on 2 lbs of muscle in a month during your noob gains. That's with your nutrition, sleep, training, stretching, and everything else exactly perfect. So if you're putting on more than 2 pounds a month, some of it will be water weight (which is fine) and some of it will be fat (which you might want to cut later on).

So try 3100 for a month and see what it's like. Just keep in tune with yourself and decide if you're putting on too much fat and adjust from there. the 3700 from before is overkill.

If he can clearly demonstrate that he didn't cheat and that she did, he not only has the upper hand in the divorce, he can sue the person she was cheating with for inflicting harm and depriving him of companionship.

Remember that the modern family court system is a perverse alliance of tradcons and feminists. But the feminists don't fight very hard for any ground that they have to defend on their own. 

For example, look at how the legal interpretation of gay relationships has evolved. Even though it's clearly *not* a tradcon value, it's being constructed along tradcon lines even though lots of studies indicate that absent the LGBT-feminist alliance it would be a much more . . . free form structure (polyamorists, we're looking at you). The truth is that feminists aren't willing to give up the power that they have (divorce and the basic family structure) in order to pay off a smaller and weaker ally, so they've forced that ally into the framework of their stronger ally's worldview. 

Why? Because feminists aren't going to suicidally give up their best ally (tradcons) in screwing their most important opponents (any man with two pennies to rub together). They value divorce too much to risk a major reconstruction of the American family to accommodate their LGBT allies. So the kinkster, queers, perverts, and other outsiders have been ordered to get with the tradcon program as best they can, and we end up pimping the unthinkably weird model of monogamous gay marriage as if it were normal. (FTR, I support any type of marriage you want, and in my world you could marry six people from three genders if you wanted.)

The family court system is at its base a lot of left wing bullshit hung on a tradcon framework. Peel away the bullshit, and it still boils down to the basic tradcon imposition of morality from outside the individual.

In this particular instance, that happens to work to the guy's advantage."

heres_a_llama,Christianity,1389728758.0,"&gt;What exposure to learning in orthodox environments do you have?

This is going to come across snarky, but I'm a woman, I'm Conservative, and I'm a convert. How many do you want to bet? So it's usually me and a book.

&gt;Here's a llama pointed out that she doesn't like being told ""if only you learned what I know, you'd think differently,""

My degree is in International Relations, so please forgive me for using an example from that field of what I mean. Professor gets up and lectures on World Systems Theory in IR 101. It has its own precepts. It has people that wrote books explaining/""selling"" it. But 30 students can sit in a class, be presented the material, become familiar with it, and still do different things with that knowledge. Not all 30 students are going to hear that and go ""OMG. Why didn't we see the light before? We are now all WSTs!"" 

Some people are going to learn about it, going to consider it, and still reject it because they find it lacking. Their criteria for lacking may not be yours. You may think it is invalid, you may think it is secondary to others... but that's they're criteria. And unless you're trying to say that the only criteria that matter are yours and you have the right to determine criteria for everyone... how do you overcome this inevitability?

&gt;Would you be open to sitting in classes taught by orthodox rabbis/ rebbitzons?

Yes, I absolutely would. I'm not opposed to Orthodox teachers, with their knowledge, worldview, and thoughts. I want to learn, and am open to many different teachers.

&gt;but as someone who grew up reform and had 4 years of Hebrew school experience and 4 years of bbyo, there actually is a difference in what is learned because of what is taught.

You will find that in all educational institutions, though. I'm not going to go into a Montessori school and be shocked, shocked I tell you, that they're letting kids pick what they want to do for 3 hours at a time.

What upsets me is that, for example, we're looking at buying a home, so I was checking out the local synagogues in that area. The Chabad there is the only Orthodox. I checked out its website and it has a soap making class for women, and ""sold it"" as ""Cleanse your soul with a soap making workshop and learn the tale of the two souls!"" It was covered in flowers and pink hues.

Or, for Rosh HaShannah, they had ""The Art of Shana Tova Cards"", where ""our very own talented art teacher will help us create beautifully crafted cards to send to friends and families.

Or, for Tu B'Shevat, come and learn how to make salads with the seven fruits.

What does this sound like to me? ""For those of you who are walking uteruses with no intellectual capacity or desire, please come learn how to play house with us!""

&gt; Do you read Jewish books that are more directed to the orthodox community?

Yeah, I do. I split about 30% Conservative, 20% Orthodox, 50% Hebrew skills as far as my Jewish reading goes. At the moment, I'm reading Kaplan's Tefillin. Have Halakhic Man on my bookshelf next. Second in line at library for Lamm's Torah Umadda.

Prior to my wedding, I read a bunch of family purity books. My issue is that, yet again, when we get to shalom bayis chapters, it was all ""be demure, don't ever say anything about his family."" 

&gt;Do you ever have orthodox rabbis speak at your shuls even if it conflicts with his hashgafa?

Very few have come to my synagogue. What happens a lot is that once a quarter, we have a local Reconstructionist, Reform, Conservative, and (Modern) Orthodox rabbi form a panel on a big topic. They meet for two or so hours at the JCC, where the moderator poses 3 or 4 big questions that they all answer, and then they open it up to the crowd for Q&amp;A. I met my husband at an Orthodox shul and that shul's rabbi served as mashgiach for our wedding. I went with my inlaws to their Chabad Yamim Noraim. Chabad came to my undergrad college campus a lot too around the Chagim, given that we were in Arkansas' suburbs without cars or public transportation.

&gt;What is your relationship with chabad?

Appreciate what they do. Don't always agree with their stances."

drewiepoodle,politics,1389728801.0,"sex and gender are two different things. sex is what is between your legs, gender is what is in your head. we dont choose what gender we are, just as we dont choose our sexuality. psychologists in the early days DID try to change the individual's mind, but that never worked, you cant change your gender. so that's why we ended up with the protocol we have today, where we change our bodies to match the gender in our head. there are plenty of studies that back this up.

and some of us DONT get reassignment surgery, i know many trans guys and girls who arent comfortable with surgery, but you'd never know it because to outward appearances, we look like any other girl or guy. it's the hormones that make us who we are. think of a car that somehow manages to operate on a really low grade of gas, with the engine knocking all the time. yeah it works, but not very well. now imagine you filling up the car with 110 octane racing fuel. it'll feel like a brand new car. it's kinda like that.

you may not know it, but the people you clock as obviously trans are usually the male to female trans girls who have just started their transition or have features that you identify as male. there are many cis girls who are read as trans because of this, simply because they dont conform with society's definition of what a female is supposed to look like. it doesnt happen so often with female to male trans guys, but that's probably because they get read as a butch lesbian. either way, it still sucks for the individual because they dont get gendered properly.

gender doesnt exist in binary form, just male and female, it's more of a spectrum. while individuals exist at either ends of the spectrum, the hulking rambo or the super girly girl, most of us exist somewhere inbetween. and some of us choose to bend that even further by choosing different gender expressions. 

gender is really complicated, i've found out by talking to other trans girls and guys, i guess we think and talk about it a lot more than other people. and even in the trans community, the variance is pretty wide.

d3gu,Christianity,1389728899.0,"I think making life-choice decisions for kids (and I'm talking permenant or hard to change things, not a haircut), such as a special diet, piercings, memberships that are hard to cancel, body alterations, pen-handedness, lifestyle choices (such as living in a commune) and so on are unfair and don't give the kid a chance to grow up with the same chances as other children. 

IMO, lifestyle choices can only be made by consenting adults. Including serious religious decisions like baptism. I just think that if you want to have a faith, you have to be old enough to understand the commitment to your god(s). A baby cannot follow the 10 commandments or any other, and therefore shouldn't be baptised or whatever. Surely god wouldn't expect a baby to 'honour your father and mother' everytime it cries, and toddlers may idolise a toy or tv character. Children have no concept of god. But that's just me. 

The reason why I made the distinction is that OP and others are saying, 'God forgives all, including child molesters', but since I believe children shouldn't have to be concerned with what god does/doesn't forgive (since they are probably unable to understand or commit to religion), then it shouldn't be used as an excuse.

Plus, who are we to assume what god forgives? We only have the bible, written by man, and men aren't omnipotent.

Forgive any ignorance, but I'm a Buddhist and whilst I have read the bible &amp; attended some religious seminars, I don't really know much about Christianity."

-Why I'm doing this:-

Let's set the record straight, I'm not a guru, and I'm not the best PC builder in the world with knowledge of every part or technology in existence. I do how ever have a general rounded knowledge of parts, requirements and current product market compared to your average beginner seeking advice; **the least I can do is make the process easeir for others.**

I like being overly helpful, helping everyone learn; and I am very fond of the $1000 project mark as it represents a great balance regarding middle ground enthusiast performance. 

I stand by most of my beliefs, but am very receptive to learning new facts when it's apparent other's understand specifics more than myself; some of you may be able to see these changes in my approach over time.

Thank-you for enjoying my tutorial. If I manage to successfully help one person with this, it will have been a success :)"

I had highlights done in the summer, and it's been (obviously) growing out. So I've got this whole ombre thing happening right now (blonde with brown roots).  

I decided I should try just a section of hair for the time being to make sure it doesn't turn into a disaster.

I bought this red Ion stuff from Sally Beauty that you can just put on your head sans developer, etc.  Left it on for about 45 min. 

Washing it out I tried to get as much of the colour out of the section before letting the rest of my hair down.  Then I conditioned my whole head.

Aaaaaand the red I was going for actually ended up being more fuchsia.  So now I have a whole section of pink in my hair, and because my hair is so thin, it basically looks like I just dipped all the ends of my hair in pink dye.  

It looks pretty awesome, actually and I'm going to rock it until it fades.  But, I will say that I am super glad I didn't do the whole head right off the bat. "

**Directions**: Once you have decided on your template build, click ""PCPartPicker part list"", then click ""Edit Build"" where it will then be ready for you to manipulate.

Ready? Continue.

.

**Step 1:**

*Do you need to purchase Windows?*

If yes, select one; click ""Add to Part List""

* **1.** [Windows 8](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-wn700615) | $99.98 - Recommended, higher performance over W7

* **2.** [Windows 7](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/microsoft-os-gfc02050) | $82.99 - Cheaper, slower

.

**Step 2:** 

*Still have money to spend?*

If yes;

* *Do you wish to buy a better GPU?* ( **[Skip to Part 3: Part Exchange &amp; Alternatives](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1v7pic/tutorial_1000_usd_gaming_rig_for_beginners_the/cepi72m)** )

* *Do you want a quicker/snappier system | response time?* ( **Then proceed below** )

**Or both?**, I don't know how much you plan to spend ;)

* **SSD** - Click **[HERE](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/samsung-internal-hard-drive-mz7te120bw)**; then click ""Add to Part List""

*But but! 120gb is not enough!* - Answer is located [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1v7pic/tutorial_1000_usd_gaming_rig_for_beginners_the/cepvdw2)

*Why Samsung? There are cheaper options?*, Samsung is more or less the only brand that manufacturers all of the parts in their product, as well as parts for competitors who also build SSD's. Samsung has some of the best performance and reliability on the market; so the safest bet is to choose... Samsung.

I assure you, the smugness would be quite the same if you went to church and told Christians 'I thought atheism was right.'  Many of us were lectured to by 'ex-atheists' at church talking about how lost they were before they found Jesus.

That said, everything good about churches does not 'require' superstition, so it's sad that the religion basically co-opts these great human things (charity, community) and tacks on top of it ignorance, which ironically works against the very values it claims to stand for.

So if you believe religion is one of many things holding humanity back from peace, then it's good news.

Another point is that atheists are often alone in their views, so it's exciting to meet others and gossip about the crazy things we used to believe.  Ironically, this is part of the process of forming a new community.  And of course, some were traumatized in churches, so they will always view them as dark places.

Basically, atheists are still human, so some of them will be smug or whatever.  Especially the youth.  There is no atheist commandment that says 'thou shall not be smug', and I don't think it reflects at all on atheism as a worldview."

namer98,Christianity,1389729211.0,"Halacha 1

During the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one of those who erred.

Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.

After conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.

This was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except for this star.

This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): ""Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;"" i.e., all know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of conceiving of this emptiness as Your will.

Halacha 2

After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets - who told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say: Serve this star - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it.

He would inform them of a form that he had conceived, and tell them that this is the image of the particular star, claiming that this was revealed to him in a prophetic vision. In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills.

People would gather together and bow down to them and the [false prophets] would say: This image is the source of benefit or harm. It is appropriate to serve it and fear it. Their priests would tell them: This service will enable you to multiply and be successful. Do this and this, or do not do this or this.

Subsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this.

Thus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [It was no longer part of] their speech or thought, and they no longer knew Him. Thus, all the common people, the women, and the children would know only the image of wood or stone and the temples of stone to which they were trained from their childhood to bow down and serve, and in whose name they swore.

The wise men among them would think that there is no God other than the stars and spheres for whose sake, and in resemblance of which, they had made these images. The Eternal Rock was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals: for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever. The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born.

Halacha 3

After this mighty man was weaned, he began to explore and think. Though he was a child, he began to think [incessantly] throughout the day and night, wondering: How is it possible for the sphere to continue to revolve without having anyone controlling it? Who is causing it to revolve? Surely, it does not cause itself to revolve.

He had no teacher, nor was there anyone to inform him. Rather, he was mired in Ur Kasdim among the foolish idolaters. His father, mother, and all the people [around him] were idol worshipers, and he would worship with them. [However,] his heart was exploring and [gaining] understanding.

Ultimately, he appreciated the way of truth and understood the path of righteousness through his accurate comprehension. He realized that there was one God who controlled the sphere, that He created everything, and that there is no other God among all the other entities. He knew that the entire world was making a mistake. What caused them to err was their service of the stars and images, which made them lose awareness of the truth.

Abraham was forty years old when he became aware of his Creator. When he recognized and knew Him, he began to formulate replies to the inhabitants of Ur Kasdim and debate with them, telling them that they were not following a proper path.

He broke their idols and began to teach the people that it is fitting to serve only the God of the world. To Him [alone] is it fitting to bow down, sacrifice, and offer libations, so that the people of future [generations] would recognize Him. [Conversely,] it is fitting to destroy and break all the images, lest all the people err concerning them, like those people who thought that there are no other gods besides these [images].

When he overcame them through the strength of his arguments, the king desired to kill him. He was [saved through] a miracle and left for Charan. [There,] he began to call in a loud voice to all people and inform them that there is one God in the entire world and it is proper to serve Him. He would go out and call to the people, gathering them in city after city and country after country, until he came to the land of Canaan - proclaiming [God's existence the entire time] - as [Genesis 21:33] states: ""And He called there in the name of the Lord, the eternal God.""

When the people would gather around him and ask him about his statements, he would explain [them] to each one of them according to their understanding, until they turned to the path of truth. Ultimately, thousands and myriads gathered around him. These are the men of the house of Abraham.

He planted in their hearts this great fundamental principle, composed texts about it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac also taught others and turned [their hearts to God]. He also taught Jacob and appointed him as a teacher.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AdviceAnimals,1389729235.0,"well i think fundamentally at its core, there are generally two fundamental main types of people when it comes to ""social issues"" and ""justice""

Those that feel obliged to apply a consistent and valid set of principles and core values irrespective of the individual context and outcomes

And those that feel the outcome is the overriding factor  irrespective of principles and consistency of values.

as an extreme example if we consider racism, it is common knowledge that to be a racist or hold racial values or opinions is socially unacceptable and there is a pressure to not be racist as our society values  ""tolerance and anti-racism"" as a positive necessary trait for the greater good of society.

The problem is that if you work backwards and adjust your attitude views and opinions to what you understand to be told as a social good you run the risk of being misled.

I firmly believe that the majority of people who are so adamant about anti-racism in today's society are exactly the same type of person who would be a flag waving Nazi rounding up the Jews, because under those conditions the social pressure and common knowledge was that ""Jews were detrimental to society and their exclusion was for the greater good"".

this isn't true of all people but it is painfully common for it not to be ignored, and especially on a place such as reddit, people dont argue on first principles or concepts, but merely spouting what they have ""Learnt"" is socially responsible, rather than actually understanding why or working it out from first principles.

I genuinely have no time or desire to talk to people who simply recite what they believe is ""right"" because they have learnt so through social pressure/norms , rather than actually worked it through and understand why and and fundamental principles at hand.

I additionally have no interest or desire in the social aspect of reddit, There is no value to me in people agreeing or liking my comments or myself by virtue of its delivery (i.e a friendly nature).  if people have routinly shown complete ineptitude and failure to process simple concepts they are not worth consideration (on Reddit) to me.

The simple fact is that it's not a common occurrence. More often than not when I've seen violence started in bars and similar situations where these hypotheticals take place, it's male on male. A type of violence that is often condoned on this subreddit as self defense. I just find it strange that so many people are actively worrying about being attacked by women in bars as to make this such a regular discussion. I'm not saying it's an impossible situation, it can happen, but why is it treated as if it's an epidemic running rampant through society. 

OP did not ask if users have been in fights with women, did not ask if they've been attacked by women, did not ask if they've had women start fights with them. The question is ""Have you ever punched a woman?"" The phrasing implies nothing of retaliation or intent. This is not a question of a double standard, it's a question of why do some people find it so important to discuss when it is or isn't wrong or right to hit someone, and in this case specifically a woman. The number of people I've seen post saying they would ""absolutely punch a woman if they hit them first"" is appalling. If I'm in a bar and someone tries to punch me, my first thought is to get to safety and get help. If you honestly think hitting someone back is the best way to end a fight you obviously don't know too much about what happens in fights because they rarely end well for either party. "

Extaz,FantasyPL,1389729292.0,"Coleman is too expensive for you to hop on now, so he´s not worth it. Kompany is overvalued. Chelsea is keeping them clean sheets now and you should get azpilicueta who´s starting reguarly and he´s only 5.3 right now. He should probably get some assists aswell as he´s very attacking.

Southhampton will keep clean sheets against mid and bottom teams so a defender so I recommend that you get Clyne who´s back from injury and nailed on. He scored in their fa cup game and is a very offensive fullback. Better for FPL than Shaw imo. He´s only 4.5 too!

Now your midfield is too weak. Sterling and Januzaj need to go. 

So my suggestion is following transfers.

Kompany -&gt; Azpilicueta

Coleman -&gt; Clyne

Hazard -&gt; Oscar

Januzaj -&gt; Eriksen

Sterling -&gt; Cabaye

Pennant -&gt; Mutch

Oscar will score just a little less points than Hazard and Cabaye and Eriksen are much better than Sterling who´s not nailed on and will be used more as an impact sub now that Studge is back.

That means taking out the trash, washing dishes, buying groceries, going to work, hanging out with friends, learning something, building something, etc etc. You have to take the time to take care of your life.

What your friend actually wants is to escape life, not to live it. There are some times in life where the only thing you're doing is watching a dog take a shit. That's it. A big wet dump being pushed out an asshole and plopping indiscriminately on the ground.

Now, you can take the time and go off on tangents about the wonderful circle of life, and it's totally valid, but it's a waste of energy to think like that *all* the time. You have to experience some shit if you want to experience something grand.

drewiepoodle,politics,1389729390.0,"Sex is biological and includes physical attributes such as sex chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, internal reproductive structures, and external genitalia. At birth, it is used to identify individuals as male or female.  Gender on the other hand is far more complicated. Along with one’s physical traits, it is the complex interrelationship between those traits and one’s internal sense of self as male, female, both or neither as well as one’s outward presentations and behaviors related to that perception.

Transgender is the state of one's gender identity (self-identification as woman, man, neither or both) or gender expression not matching one's assigned sex (identification by others as male, female or intersex based on physical/genetic sex).

Several studies have concentrated on whether sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are more similar to their preferred sex or to their birth sex. Researchers caution that there are known brain differences between homosexual and heterosexual persons and that the brain changes in response to hormone-treatment, which many transsexuals use. In order to know what in the brain is related to what feature of the person, studies of more uniform groups give clearer results than do studies of more mixed groups.

Studies have consistently shown that specifically androphilic male-to-female transsexuals (sometimes called homosexual MtF transsexuals in studies) show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 biological males and 12 biological females. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the biological men responded in several brain regions that the biological women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.

Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 typical (heterosexual) females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals are halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.

**TL;DR** you're right, it's not a choice, but you're wrong that it's decided anatomically, because, science.

Some things we have no power to change, like ~~sex~~ gender."

cassidymccormick,WTF,1389729422.0,"You're not failing. A lot of new moms who feed their babies in combination feel like breast milk is not satisfying them as much as formula because formula is heavier and thus will fill them up faster and probably put them to sleep. Think of that stuffed feeling you get after eating Thanksgiving dinner. You're happy, healthy, and satisfied with regular dinner, Thanksgiving just fills you up more. That doesn't mean you need turkey and stuffing every day.  And don't worry about how long she's on you, that doesn't mean that she's not getting enough. The simple fact is that breast feeding can take a while, but that's not a bad thing. It's a precious bonding experience. And sometimes breastfeeding feels like it's taking longer because your baby has stopped eating and is now just soothing (sucking is baby's first known way of soothing herself, particularly to go to sleep). You would not notice all the soothing time with a formula baby as much because they have pacifiers for that. 

As long as your baby is happy and healthy you have nothing to worry about. If you're really worried, at your baby's next check up, ask your doctor if she's in a healthy weight range for her age. He'll let you know if there's anything to worry about. Hang in there, it get's easier. 

All this said, only you know what's best for you and your baby, so do what you think is right. I just wanted to let you know that everything you're worried about is totally normal, and I think you're doing just fine :)

But the fantasy goes like this: tomorrow we're actually going to get some coffee after work, and when we're walking out of the door it's all calm (in this fantasy she likes me back), and I put my arm around her middle, pull her against my body, brush her hair away gently (it's probably not called brushing, but English isn't my native language, so work with me s.v.p. :)), and put my hand on her cheek all calmly and slowly kiss her. 

For some reason I have the feeling we're actually going to kiss tomorrow, but if highly doubt that. But a man can dream, right? "

""Mmph. Well, I do not know how to answer, but that is the signal. Joan, I do not know why you are acting this way, and you will likely be mad at me, but I hope you will one day forgive me for what I am about to do.""  
  
*Orville cracks his knuckles and grins. He raises his firsts and slams them on the ground. The ground in the field begins to shake, then a crack appears where Orville had been standing before, and another where he had been before that. Everywhere Orville has stomped in this pursuit, a sizable crack is made in the ground, each one increasing the intensity of the earth's vibrations. Hundreds of cracks appear along the path Orville has taken, and Alambil shakes violently. As the most violent earthquake Crickhollow has ever seen happens, a hole appears in the ground where Orville slammed his fists, not large enough for himself or Seuss to enter, but certainly large enough for Joan. The earth rumbling and shifting, everybody but Orville is caught off guard, and he grabs Joan and tosses her into the hole. Joan sees a tunnel. Every one of Orville's stomps started hollowing out the ground, creating ten layers of dirt before loosening the ground far below where Orville's feet touched the surface. When he punched the ground, this loosened ground created a tunnel. The tunnel reaches all the way back to the inn where Joan's problems started, and instead of leading back to the surface, into the old abandoned mineshafts of Alambil. Before Joan can react, Orville stomps on the ground where the hole is, sealing it off, trapping Joan in the tunnel he has made.*  
  
""I offer my sincerest apologies, Joan, but I had to do this! And to make sure this deranged medicine man does not follow or that you dig your way through, I must also do this!""  
  
*Orville stomps his foot again, and the tunnel starts to collapse from the end Orville tossed Joan in. She'll have to run the length of it to the mines to avoid being crushed by falling rubble. Orville turns to Seuss, spouting off another haiku.*

Compared to, say, Castles of Burgundy, where the options are roughly equal and the dice simply unlock various possibilities.

That, and Kingsburg has a massive rich-get-richer problem. You can generally determine the winner by about halfway through the game. And if you're unlucky during the first round and one of your buildings gets destroyed by the monster, the lack of VPs from that combined with the VP bonuses for anyone that won are crippling. The catch-up mechanisms are inadequate, especially since the leading player continues to accrue bonuses.

3D chips might come in and save the day, but if they're so great, why aren't we already using them?  Because they are nearly impossible to keep cool, so serious R&amp;D isn't going to go towards them until transistors have become as small as they'll ever be.

Read: ""Guys will still try to hit on you and women who don't know you might take pitty on you.""

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1389729712.0,"That's an interesting question.

If she has qualities that men want in a partner, but she purposefully avoids commitment, then it means she has some other priority over having a relation - a phenomenon which is rare among women. Most women want a relationship with a dominant man.

I can only see two explanations fitting this scenario:

1. **The girl is high quality, and her suitors are also high quality men.** Men want to LTR her, but she declines because she is motivated for personal achievement rather than securing a provider. In that sense, she's more like a man than a woman. I wouldn't refer to this woman as a slut, because her sexual pursuits are largely purposeful, done for satisfaction rather than for validation.

2. **The girl is low quality, but *perceived* as high quality by her low quality orbiters.** She refuses her suitors because she feels entitled to something better, but she still has lots of sex (mostly for validation). Her goal is to secure a provider, but she lacks the quality to win a truly quality man. I would refer to this woman as a slut, because her imperative is stereotypically female, and her sexual pursuits are done out of a need for validation.

The question becomes, why is she staying out of LTRs, what's her end goal? That's my input.

Great question."

brotherbock,AskReddit,1389729731.0,"You know...I had him come in, talked to him, and after talking to my course supervisor (who was also my own thesis advisor), I decided to 

1) fail him on the test, but

2) let him take a new test and at least count it as a completed assignment (but an F for the test grade).

I decided to do that because, in the end, he did own up to what he did. It took that female player calling him and I assume tearing him a new one (would have loved to have heard that conversation) first, but...I've been in bad situations, ones where you know you are caught and you just hope you can get out of it. So once he owned up to me, I decided to try to punish the cheating but also reward the eventual honesty.

I've had people say I should have just failed him outright, and I don't know that that would have been wrong either. But my personal contact with him there made me go another route. 

I never communicated with him again, but I really hope my decision helped him learn something. Who knows.


Edit: I suppose I can add this...with the test completed (but failed), he didn't fail the course. I don't remember what grade he got, but it wasn't good. Some sort of D, to be sure. He got invited to the USA National Team trials apparently, but I don't think he made the cut. No NBA, not sure what happened to him after that. Google has very little to say about him.

Beyond that, you also have the problem of sending messages, which because of username authentication etc becomes complicated. Facebook chat is compatible with a certain messaging protocol called Jabber, so it is standardized (you can actually set up Facebook chat with the messages app on a Mac), but given the fact that there's actually a dedicated Facebook messenger app that takes care of all of this stuff a lot better than a hacked-up Messages app ever could, it's probably not worth the effort."

There's SO FUCKING MUCH wrong with this statement. 

First of all the supposed existence of nukes or WMDs is EXACTLY why bush and the entire us military showed up there in the first place. It was a fucking lie, but there you go. 

Secondly the campaign was under the premise of fighting the iraqi regime and had nothing - repeat, nothing - to do with al qaeda. 

Thirdly the hussein regime had military jets. Lots of them. 

Fourthly a presidential visit during a war always has inherint risk.

Fifthly, and this is the most important part, *you need to know more about all of this stuff, and not just shit that some angry idiot on reddit tells you. This was 10 fucking years ago, not the last ice age. it matters TODAY.*

You're 100% correct in noting that there have been a huge number of attempts of the ""textbook exchange"" model.  I've talked with over five ex-CEOs of now-failed ventures.  It's just a really, really tough problem (network effects, and college students are lazy), so none have ever really taken off.

I acknowledge and agree that we're not cutting to the heart of the issue, but I think that we're putting a good first-step that will actually help students NOW.  The holy grail would be broadly adopted open source textbooks from a company like Boundless or Flatworld.  But no matter what, most people I've spoken to think that that is at least 5-10 years out (publishers and professors are loathe to change, and they hold the power).

Kids learn where vegetables come from in their first year of school. When you go a shop, you see potatoes, covered in dirt because they come from the soil. Tomatoes with green stems attached. Young carrots come with leaves, and so do a number of other vegetables. The *word* vegetable means more or less ""growing"". They have seeds and stuff. There is no way that anyone could have a problem noticing that plants come from the ground and can be eaten *unless a huge array of marketing and social mechanisms set out to make it so.*

These kind of texts are a primitive attempt at making people feel inferior, which accomplishes nothing. The author naturally doesn't see *himself* as that one last  person who somehow magically cannot eat a cabbage ; oh no, that will be one of those stupid walmart people, or something. Obviously not *me*. I'm different.

inc_mplete,loseit,1389730101.0,"Here's how you see more results:

Breakfast

•Kellogs cereal or similar for 110 cals with 2% milk --&gt; Don't eat cereal at all... it has hidden sugars.  If anything find one that's 100 cal and have it with skim milk.
•Coffee with splenda and small amount of creamer --&gt; try drinking the coffee black.  Adding creams and what not denatures the properties of coffee.

Lunch

•Arnolds flat bread with turkey, swiss, mayo --&gt; ditch the swiss... try Rye bread with mayo and grilled chicken breast.  Just assuming your turkey is deli meat it's all processed.
•Chobani yogurt --&gt;  processed sugars again if they're fruit flavoured.  Have a hardboiled egg instead.

Snack

•Kellogs popcorn chips serving size --&gt; Processed again... low in cal but packed with sodium and carbs.  Replace with veggie sticks and hummus dip.


Dinner

•Something healthy under 300 cals usually. Think spaghetti squash, sweet potatoes, ground turkey etc. --&gt; this is good.


Snack

•Hot chocolate with 2% --&gt; you need a new snack.  Packed with sugar again... 
Have fruits or almonds as a snack.

Cut the diet soda... just cuz it has 0 cal doesn't curb your cravings at all.  Just causes acid wear in teeth and i find the sweetness just makes you crave more food.

Go low sugar and low carb... works wonders.  You can indulge once in awhile but your everyday regiment isn't as healthy as the commercials and boxes make it to be.

Make sure you have protein, fiber, and veggies.  Don't load it with sauce or fry.. grill or bake.

I've stuck with cleaner foods and drinking unsweetened almond milk, black coffee, and water.  Sounds boring but it's effective."
screenmagnet,sex,1389730104.0,"The 5 inches would not be a deal breaker, but the 4.25 inches might be. If we were unmarried, I might leave. If there was anything else in the relationship that was making me unhappy, the loss of penis size would probably be the last straw. If we were married, I would only leave if he was unwilling to work with me to find a solution. We would need to get very creative -- penis pumps, cock rings, sleeves/extenders, strap ons, swinging, etc. I would also be doing mad kegels and would consider getting surgery on my vag to tighten it up, or using irritants inside my vag to engorge it. And I would want him to try jelquing or traction therapy to restore the size of his penis permanently.

This is something I actually worry about happening in the future. Surgery for prostate cancer can lead to significant reduction in penis size and permanent erectile dysfunction. Not sure how well I would handle that. Or penile cancer requiring amputation. In that case, I would want to pursue extreme measures, such as penile implant or transplant. If that wasn't an option, I might just take hormones to permanently kill my sex drive so that I could keep my sanity.

I am a very superficial and picky person, which is why I am so careful about choosing  the man I will marry. But I take marriage vows very, very seriously. It would take extreme circumstances for me to divorce my husband, particularly if kids are in the picture (I am the type of woman who would stay in a marriage despite such things as cheating, drug addiction, or severe mental illness). That is why I have such high standards for dating -- I need to pick a man that I will be happy with for the rest of my life, because I don't really consider divorce to be an option.

I do not have narcissistic personality disorder. Not even close. I know myself and what I want very well, and I don't sugar coat things -- I guess that can come off as narcissistic, but I think I just don't hide my ego as much as other people do. I do have various other diagnosed mental illnesses (bipolar, ADHD, OCD, Tourette's, and anxiety). I actually have struggled my entire life with poor self esteem, poor body image (including an eating disorder), and poor self confidence. I am highly critical of myself. But that doesn't stop me from being critical of other people. I have equally high standards for myself as I do for everyone else. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder when I was 14. But I overcame that with years of intense therapy, and I haven't met the criteria for BPD for several years now. Still struggle with fear of abandonment though, and probably will for the rest of my life. I had a very difficult childhood, and some scars never fully heal. Some of those emotional scars are, ironically, from my parents telling me since I was a kid that I'm a selfish narcissist incapable of love or empathy. I guess that's why I am so blunt and honest about the ugly parts of my soul. Everybody always told me I was an asshole anyway, so after a while I stopped trying to fight the label and just embraced that side of myself.

Btw, you will have a hard time finding someone with NPD who will recognize and admit that they are a narcissist. They don't typically get diagnosed directly (because they don't seek help), and when they do, they tend not to believe their diagnosis anyway.

I also, as I imagine you've gathered by now, have led far from a perfect life. On the surface, my life can appear pretty perfect. I have the perfect career, perfect boyfriend,  and all the trappings of the perfect upper middle class life. But as so often happens when you look at someone with a seemingly charmed life, peel back the surface layer and you will discover a lifetime of emotional turmoil, abuse, and a wasteland of dysfunctional family relationships. The world is full of high functioning neurotics such as myself.

Hope I answered your questions in the midst of all that painfully self-involved tl;dr. ; &gt;"
noc007,raisedbynarcissists,1389730105.0,"That sucks. My story isn't as bad. This is more therapeutic for me to post.

Both of my parents have ADD in addition to being Ns. It wasn't until I was an adult that I got diagnosed with ADD. A little bit later my dad got tested and diagnosed, but my Nmom doesn't want to and is worse than my Ndad in terms of being scattered. My Ndad took the news of being ADD pretty hard for some odd reason, is embarrassed by it, and decided in typical N fashion that everyone needs to deal with his behavior instead of doing something about it. Early on in my education it was obvious that I had attention problems. Last year my Nmom told me that they knew I was ADD, but chose to not do anything about it. I'm pretty sure they were embarrassed by this information and instead took the N method of dealing with it by ridiculing me, teasing me, telling me I need to ""stop going to La La Land"", and overall ensuring my failure.

In HS I really had no idea what I wanted to do for a career. My Ndad told me that he'd get a second job to put me through college if it came to it. I was also told I'd get his Rolex after I graduated college which isn't much motivation as I don't particularly like the looks or have a need for that kind of watch. Pretty much he tried to maintain control of my life after HS and told me where I should work and what I should do. My HS transcript wasn't going to get me anywhere so I applied for a community college to start and then transfer after a year or two.

The penny drops when I need to pay for tuition and books and I need to pay my way. I had quit my job to make time for school. I spend all of my savings on it and give it a try. Between depression, lack of motivation, and shitty home life, it's no surprise I didn't do well. My Ndad tells me I should do IT as I've already been doing it on the side for years. He tells me I should go to this cert farm and get certifications because people are making bank. I go into debt sitting in a class about stuff I already know. Of course the company was borderline fly by night and folds soon after leaving me with nothing to show for my debt which took a many years to get the bank to forgive the loan.

My Ndad still tells me he'll give me the watch when I get a degree. I really don't understand how it's any kind of motivation or reward. I don't want the thing. If he died and I inherited it, at the first opportunity I'd sell the stupid thing. I wouldn't get much for it since it's missing the box and is pretty old so it's missing all of the stuff Rolex has been doing to distinguish their products from counterfeits. I've made my way in IT and am doing better than most of my peers from HS partially because I never bothered with college. I make my decisions now when it comes to my career and he gets figuratively smacked when he tries to poke his nose in my business."

ClaimedBeauty,AskWomen,1389730133.0,"It was mainly stupidity. Not religious, no pressure, in fact my family tried to talk me out of the first one. 
First marriage I was 18 when we met, 20 when we married and almost 22 when we split. As I said we were both military and he convinced me that he was going to be stationed in Japan for 4 years so if we wanted to stay together, we would have to get married. I believed him.

After we divorced I wound up with a new boyfriend who got me pregnant. He and I split up and I learned how to be a single mom. 

I was 24 when my roommate introduced me to her friend, he was 38 and married at the time, but pursued me anyway. I would have nothing to do with him, so he divorced his wife of 15 years because he wanted kids and she didn't and then he convinced me to date him. On the surface he had everything going for him. A good job, goals, little to no debt and he was really smart. 
His wife kept the house so he moved in with his BFF and asked me and my son to move in with him. For my 25th birthday he took me to Vegas for a week and while there I got super drunk and he convinced me that we should get married.

About a month after the marriage I borrowed his laptop and found all the gay porn and his AFF profile. After reading about how he was a Total Bottom looking for a discreet relationship so his wife (me) wouldn't find out, I packed my kid and left.

My third husband was a totally different story, he's my best friends brother in law, I've know his family for years before he and I even met. So I had a very clear idea of his values before we started dating. Our first date was on my 27th birthday and ended in the ER when I stepped on a nail. It was still the best first date ever.

In addition to the 3 times I've been married, I've been proposed to an additional 4 times. So I guess the real question is what is it about me that makes guys want to marry me. I still don't get it.

The prefered alternative is the 1600mhz model, but the low cost provided by Newegg.com are currently out of stock.

Honestly, the Ballistix sport will probably work sufficiently, but it lacks XMP support, and I have a close friend who recently had to RMA those due to compatibility/QC issues. That's why I've been opting away from value models.

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1389730320.0,"&gt;found that a man’s score on a test of “benevolent sexism” – a view of women as “deserving of men’s adoration and protection” – was directly correlated with his overall life satisfaction. Their results also indicated that women are happier in relationships with sexist men.

Essential Red Pill distilled, right here. There's nothing women like more than a ""cheerful misogynist"".

&gt;Hammond and Chris G. Sibley, who conducted both studies, personally view benevolent sexism in a negative light, writing that it “functions to uphold gender inequality.”

These idiots decide to pander to feminists by *disregarding the results of their own fucking study.* Such is ever the nature of Blue Pill indoctrination.

It's partially because I spend too much time on subreddits that talk about this sort of thing, but I see this question pop up a lot. The more regularly it pops up the more it worries me. Often people have no bad intentions, and I don't think OP had them, but again, it's that so many people spend so much time worrying about it. I don't see being able to hit women as equal rights, I see it that no one should have to worry about being hit. The best way to stop people from getting hit is to stop people from hitting. It's no different from any other crime. We shouldn't tell people to stop being murdered, prevent being robbed, or avoid rapists, we need to stop murderers, thieves, rapists, and in this case violent people. I think the question that needs to be asked instead of ""is it alright to hit a woman/man/anyone?"" is ""How can we stop people from being violent?"" 

I understand that we're on a subreddit and it's just a question, no one is currently being hit, but people are still bringing up the topic of violence and approaching it from the wrong angle. We don't justify revenge killings, why should we justify revenge violence? "

einTier,pics,1389730373.0,"Sure.  Ford is selling 10 times as many Fusions as Tesla is selling Model S's -- which happens to be the best selling luxury sedan.  

But it's not that those big luxury sedans aren't profitable.  Tesla is doing quite well with record profits and solidly in the black.  I'm pretty sure everyone from Ford to Mercedes wishes they owned them instead of having to compete with them.  

Sure, you don't have the economies of scale you have with the Fusion, but if you're a smart manufacturer, even your high end product shares an awful lot of production parts with everything else.  It's not the cost of the chassis that kills you, it's all the little bespoke items from tail lamps to switch gear -- and a reason that most of the switch gear in a Tesla actually comes from Mercedes Benz. 

Ford wouldn't use a new motor for the Continental.  They'd do what GM does and leverage one of the 5.0L Mustang/Cobra/Shelby engines and cram that in.  They wouldn't build all new switches and seats and everything else, they would just leverage their partnership with Aston Martin have them crank out the interior from the same suppliers that do the Rapide.  Or for that matter, partner with Aston Martin to build a Continental and a ""baby Rapide"" on the same production line, splitting costs.  

There are ways to build this kind of sedan without breaking the bank, and Lincoln definitely needs some kind of brand identifier.  Of course, that's assuming Ford even wants to save Lincoln, which right now it doesn't look like they want to do.   Lincoln is looking more and more like Oldsmobile circa 2003 -- forgotten and dated products, no new development, little advertising, and trying to maintain a quiet presence at the back of the room lest someone remember there's little to justify their budget.

The problem with this is that it is not a good explanation. It points out something which is probably too remarkable to be coincidence - that these weird things in the economy seem ""perfectly suited to maintaining the power of finance capital"", but this does not posit a causal mechanism for why this is the case.

Actually, I'm still not completely over it, so I can relate. You're right, the best thing to do is to move on, but you also are completely correct that it really, really hurts. It's going to hurt for awhile. Unfortunately, that's the way it goes; this won't be the last time someone important to you stops being a part of your life, but it gets easier each time (or at least, I hope it does).

The way to let go and move on is a 2-parter. Letting go on the surface isn't too hard; you just need to admit that it's not going to happen and you need to not try to make it happen. If you're anything like me, you're going to continue wanting that person back for awhile, but it's been getting easier and has been hurting less as time goes on. The second part is moving on, and that's something that I'm having trouble doing. In order to move on, you have to do other things/meet other people, and that's hard, for me at least.

It sounds like you've already gotten past the first part of admitting that the right thing to do is to let go, so now comes the hard part. I suggest trying to meet other people, or to spend more time with any friends that you do have. You're right; time will heal you, but unfortunately, that takes time (obvious, I know, but it'd be a lot easier if it was instant...). It will get easier, which isn't a huge comfort to you right now, in this moment, but hold out hope.

It's the same with really good coffee.  I liken it to language, actually; if you're in a foreign country, it helps immensely to speak the language.  In order to do so, you need to have some experience with said language.  Similarly, you don't develop a taste for good coffee until after you've had some experience with really good coffee.

I think maternity/paternity leave can be as generous as necessary as long as i am not the person burning out doing two and three jobs because nobody hired a temp.

I would also like to see more results-oriented employee evaluations rather than straight ass in chair time, because whatever the childfree do outside of the office is seen as less legitimate as taking little tommy to the doctor or something. If we could stop judging people for ass in chair and more for actual work output, that way people with kids can take off of work for their kid shit and i can do my stuff. 

I also wish that the people who choose to have kids would realize that they may not have kid-compatible careers, im looking at you, receptionists and admin assistants, which are one of the few jobs that are ass in chair by nature."

slapdashbr,buildapc,1389730928.0,"Not really. The 770 is the most powerful card I would recommend currently for 1080p. Most games will run at absolutely max settings on a 770 at 60 fps. A small number of games will not quite be able to do this- the crysis and metro series games, basically, which were both deliberately developed to require high end hardware. Not to criticize that design decision, but I don't think it's worth building a system around the extreme requirements of a literal handful of games. Even BF4, which looks fantastic, but was designed to run smoothly on as many systems as possible, will hit 60 fps with something as ""weak"" as an r9-270x. 

Since the price jump from a 770 to a 780 is almost $200, but the performance increase is only around 30% *if you aren't already getting 60 fps*, I don't think it's worth it for 1080p. 

The problem with going up to 2560x1440 is that, while a single 780 is pretty strong, it definitely will not get a solid 60 fps with most games at that resolution. Like I said it's only about 30% more powerful than a 770, while a 1440 screen is about 90% more demanding. For 2560x1440 I recommend dual 760s or dual 770s. For the cost, dual 760s will out-perform a single 780 at any resolution and setting where that is a relevant option. Dual 770s will slightly outperform a single 780Ti. 

The super-high-end cards available right now, the 780Ti and the R9-290(x), are less efficient than a dual-GPU setup for any resolution up to 2560x1600. They are suited either for systems that must run a 1440p or larger monitor with only one GPU, such as a mITX build, or in SLI/xfire for a 4k monitor. "

And it was one of the worst things to ever happen to me because she knew she could be more dominant.  Without a way out, I was trapped.

So always be the dominant one.  You don't have to make the decisions 100% of the time.  But when she does make a decision, make it ok for her to make it.  That way even though she's making the decision, you're still in charge.

There are a small number of textbook publishers that have little reason to drive price down through heavy competition.  They're happier to change editions, bundle online content, and the like, to keep prices high.  They also enjoy integration (either vertical, or through tight partnerships) with campus bookstores, which exacerbates the issue.

There are a few companies fighting back with open-source textbooks, such as Flatworld and Boundless.

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389730988.0,"suicide is logically irrational to me (and due to extreme bouts of depression this belief has literally saved my life).  

if you believe in heaven or hell or that kinda thing i can't offer you much since we're starting from very distant viewpoints, but my views on suicide from a generally atheist mindset:

is life truly worth living?  nobody knows.  is life not worth living?  nobody knows.

but:  human experience is contingent on life.  in my experience, the strongest desire for suicide comes from a desire for relief.  to cease one's own life offers no relief from the pains of depression because relief is an experience.

the logic of suicide only makes sense if relief is guaranteed to be unattainable.  there are no such things as permanent states in the human experience, time dictates that everything will always be a little different from one moment to the next.

there are certain patterns we can observe where the guarantee of no improvement seems obvious (example: terminal illness).  however, there are so many uncertainties to the nature of reality, even these instances seem logically flawed (ex: there COULD always be an experimental breakthrough in science).

death is a permanent effect of temporarily spending time alive.  it is egotistically incorrect to assume one has the omniscience necessary to KNOW whether or not their emotional experience will render their life too painful to be worth it.  a deeply depressed aging cancer patient is no more justified ending his life than a bored existentialist tired of sitting in traffic.

however, i think it is ALSO egotistically incorrect to assume one has the omniscience necessary to deem something objectively moral or immoral.  to judge others is to marginalize the authenticity of their experiences."

If a girl is happy with a smaller penis, is willing to settle for one, that's fine too. But my impression of the OP is that she wasn't truly okay with settling for her guy's penis. Rather, she was trying to convince herself (and everyone else) that she was okay with it, because she felt like she didn't have a right to leave an otherwise perfect  guy over the size of his dick. That's not going to end well for the OP or her boyfriend. Deal breakers don't go away just because we want them to.

ComradeVoytek,pcmasterrace,1389731198.0,"I've been using a 5850, and then when it broke, a 6870 (great XFX warranty) since 2010, and they've been good GPUs for me. Solid price, pretty good performance at 1080P especially, considering those prices. 

In my opinion though, if you want to go higher end, it's nVidia all the way. If a big sticking point, is just hardcore-to-the-decimal-point dollar to performance ratio, then you should probably be going AMD, but if you want just raw performance for a bit more cash, I've got my money on nVidia.

 I'm still using a 6870 and it's definitely showing its age, but personally for my new build, I went the raw performance route, no corners cut nVidia. The main reason for that was honestly my experience with Far Cry 3 a year ago. Launch day, 560s were playing on ultra, but 7970s were stuttering around High. It took around 4 days before AMD cards could play without a ton of issues, and it almost ruined the game for me. 

This wasn't the first time crummy driver support had done that to me, and while it wasn't strictly AMD's fault, it just felt to me that the nVidia counterparts were always outdoing the AMD cards for just a bit higher price tag.

 Anyways, those are just my experiences. I love that there is no clear cut winner, and how even the GPU market is. Healthy competition is great for the consumer, and it's made just one part of why PC gaming is in this renewal and renaissance. "

I could kill a person after minimally torturing them or after extremely torturing them.  To pat me on the back for the first act is ridiculous. 

Remember, Temple Grandin is dealing with an institution that is already in place, trying to make it better, she is not the one *encouraging* the slaughter.  It is the equivalent of advocating for rights of those on death row.  By trying to improve the experience you are in no way sanctioning their death.  

And I don't see how, ""killing animals is wrong"" can be considered shallow at all.  It is one of the least shallow things you can do.  Shallow is saying that you support killing of an animal for your mere pleasure.  

I am not too sure what you mean by ""milage,"" though.  You realize this is a forum to discuss and support veganism right?  Most vegans know few other vegans.  It is places like these where shared views can be expressed."

I say this not as a fan of the school that TJ left, but as someone who lives in the area and knows the history of the family and the accusations that were put forward by many.

Really, there should just be more restrictions on what coaches can do. Pro sports coaches can't just leave the way that they do in college.

For a bit of background I'm a network engineer. My day to day work deals with keeping computers talking to each other. This thing called the internet? I'm one of the guys who keeps it working.

So yea. You want to post naked pictures of yourself online. It probably makes you feel good, doesn't it? Knowing that people think you're sexy, getting all of that attention, it's cool right?

Except that you will never keep this pictures anonymous or private. **There is no such thing as anonymity or security on the internet.** Everything you do will inevitably be tied to your online persona. When you are thirty, people will be able to find out the things you said and posted when you were fourteen. You can mark things as private, encrypt them, delete them after a few minutes - it doesn't matter. You will not escape being held accountable for everything you ever do on the internet.

Now aside from that, posting these pictures is also illegal. You're underage. By taking the pictures, you are producing child porn. By sending them, you are distributing child porn. Now of course they're not going to lock you up in prison for child pornography charges. But they will drag your name through mud, blast it all over the newspapers and television and Facebook about what your situation is, you may have to join the sex offender registry, and that shit is with you *for life*.

I realize now I've been bouncing back and forth between addressing OP, addressing OP's friend's sister, and addressing my own hypothetical nieces. Whatever - you get my point. This shit is bad news. There is nothing at all harmless about this OP.

Now if she's like most teenagers in that she isn't going to be easily convinced, I'm going to suggest shocking some healthy fear into her. Find out where she's submitting these pictures, and than do a google search of her name. Replace the actual results with results that lead to those sites. Then print that out and give it to her. It will only take a quick google for her to realize it's not legit, but hopefully the thought that someone would be able to just google her name and find her nude body should be enough to get her to wake up.

I wish you luck OP."

Personally I do not feel attached to people and I only have one ""real"" friend, but even though I can't get comfort from others I wish I could, like you do, and that I could fit in. But what I found is that when I pretend to be something I'm not, people get more hurt when I stop caring or disappear or don't contact them anymore. I found it's better just to  be upfront not by telling people about my disorders but rather acting the way that I feel is typical for me so they will take the hint and expect that a friendship me will probably be, well, odd. Eccentric. People come into a friendship with me with eyes wide open, and that is easier. I hope you find what you are looking for.

Edit: Oh, and by the way, be ""intense"". Stare. I do those things, too. Just go with it. In all seriousness, while it has pushed some people away, I didn't like those people anyway, and am glad they are gone. The ones who are left understand, and it's much easier."

So start small.  Next time you're about to talk about something, say it with more confidence.  Keep it going.  It doesn't matter if it's a joke, opinion, fact... say it with confidence."

silverionmox,changemyview,1389731617.0,"&gt; They didn't need to export since, they weren't in trouble. They had been growing for most of 50 years, more than the European average, and didn't need a devaluation.

http://www.valeofinancial.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/GDP-per-capita-PIIGS.png

You can see that the Irish economy only did better after the introduction of the Euro, and even the banking crisis hasn't made them lose all the gains. The latter goes for Greece too. But there you see that they had their ups and downs, unlike Ireland that had mostly ups. It clearly shows that having a separate currency does not determine economic prosperity.

Also note the stability before 1972, when the Bretton Woods system with its fixed exchange rates ended - that's essentially the same as a unified currency. The growth rates also were higher, although it doesn't show because the absolute sizes are smaller.

&gt;Its different because having more countries able to do more things let's them learn from each other instead of deciding central one set of choices to go for, even if it causes inequality.

Most of European matters are coordination issues and regulations, the setting of standards etc. or free rider issues that could be evaded when just a single state did it.
But again, this is the same issue that *any* political entity faces. I see no particular reason why that would be impossible to deal with at a European level while it's natural and good on a national level.

&gt;Probably Europe. Quite correctly, assuming they don't argue amongst themselves. Of course the UK could just join the same free trade agreement as Norway and Switzerland.

And lose the say they have now in determining those rules. Please, be my guest.

&gt;The last is strange. That's like saying someone is slow to support moving power from local councils to central government, considering nearly all EU states already have parliaments.

And it's not those parliaments who do the negotiating and the vetoing; it's the governments they appointed. EP's are elected directly, the executive power isn't necessarily. Therefore moving decision power from unelected executives to elected representatives would increase accountability.

&gt;I also suspect the decrying of undemocratic nature is because the heads of the European Parliament are elected by the Parliament not by a EU wide vote.

No, that's the first time I heard a mention of that.

What is so strange about parliamentary fractions deciding about their own day-to-day organisation, anyway? Do you get to elect the heads of the parliamentary fractions in your country directly?"

I think everybody goes to the same damn place when they die, and people who do horrible things while ""living"" suffer intense worldly consequences. 

As for the whole Christian thing...

If God knows exactly what is going to happen to us, and knows every decision that we are going to make for ourselves before we are born... *why* would he make us if he knew we were going to burn in hell anyway?

I believe Jesus(along with many others) was sent by God not to save the ""Christians"" but to ""save"" all of humanity, period. No matter what we decided in our lifetime. And not to save us from ""hell"", but to save us from ourselves.

Well, yes. There's a difference between people who have never experienced a positive social lifestyle from an early age and those who have, but were pulled out of it for some reason.

I remember several bullied and socially excluded people over the years and my experience has always been that they think any approach towards them is the so-manieth attempt to ridicule them somehow. Others would simply form their own group with others and have a positive experience that way.

Socially excluded people are easy targets for bullying. If they grew up like that, it's what they're going to expect from life. If it was introduced much later, they'll probably already have the experience to deal with it."

Talking to my doctor after that, she told me that you need to actually physically grab and pull the strings in order to remove an IUD with a menstrual cup.  Clearly that is possible.

I have work to do and so does he. I'm definitely not talking about constantly checking in.

Scarcer,buildapc,1389732195.0,"&gt; Why the $380 GTX 770, when you can get a 1.11 Ghz EVGA or 1.15 Ghz PNY for $330?

It fits the budget, and it is the ""Best"" GTX 770 model available, so you do pay more. The preferable alternative is [the Gigabyte model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gigabyte-video-card-gvn770oc2gd) which I have yet to finish the alternative parts list yet. In contast, the EVGA cooler is marginally worse, and I've heard bad things about PNY products so may as well avoid it.

&gt;I feel budget allocation is messed up some. A watercooled FX-8350 with a gold-certified PSU shouldn't be running a 760.

The FX-8350 model is for the AMD fan-boys, I'm obligated to give an option that is comparable to the i5-4670k build. Again the target was $1,000, GPU options will be listed. People will choose what they want.

The PSU comment I won't even touch *because of the community*, I think the selection is justified.

**EDIT: Regardless I'll list the PNY model as an alternative when I get around to listing the GPU's**

I'll edit the AMD list, how ever it may decrease it's computing/oc performance."

redditerrrr,breastfeeding,1389732345.0,"All good stuff here already, just wanted to add that water is important.  Water is key for so many things right now.  Your wife's body is going through a lot on it's own, healing, adjusting, etc.  Bodies need water to heal to begin with.  Breastmilk production requires water too.  Make sure that your wife is staying hydrated.

Regarding sleep.  Here it is, here is what you mentally prepared for and what everyone annoyingly warned you about a few weeks ago.  You're in the fight, you're knee deep in the hardest part.  It feels like your life will never normalize and you will never sleep again.  You will.  What worked for my family was that my husband would get up at night when Wiggle woke up, change a diaper if needed, and then I would nurse.  It's sounds terrible to put someone else through the sleep deprivation with you, but misery loves company.  He had to work during the day, but maternity leave ain't a vacation either.  She may feel more supported by those simple actions than any words.  Also, there are the obvious ways to help (laundry, dishes) that will minimize any household work that your wife may be tempted to do during the day.  Personally, I am not a napper, it was very bizarre to me to lay down and try to sleep with the sun up, but Wiggle had 3 hour morning naps and that was the best way for me to get a little extra sleep.  Maybe that will work for you guys too.

Your little family is adjusting to the new life you have, everyone has to change.  If your MIL is impeding that, then maybe she needs to give you guys a little more space.  You can't learn to parent under someone else's rule.  You guys will be tired and argue about what seems like very big issues, but you are setting the foundation here for how your family will operate.  It's ok to ask for space if you guys need it."

Lilcheeks,bodybuilding,1389732426.0,"This is a topic I can bitch about. 

Yea it's pretty frustrating. My newest injury is a shoulder problem. MRI showed a cyst from overuse the doctor said, which some sort of injection fixed, but also some labrum damage which he thinks isn't necessarily bad enough to stop using all together... told me to stop doing ohp and similar movements. 

My rheumatologist(for arthritis) told me the MRI on my knee from 5 years ago showed joint damage in my knee. Said to stop squatting. Okay so that explains why that knee hurts when I squat sometimes, never terrible but kinda like my shoulder. I have to keep it to once a week usually. 

Back isn't as bad anymore since I've got a decent deadlift, but I have moderate scoliosis. I think that's actually benefited from some of the lifts. 

I had minor surgery for something unrelated in August 2013 and it fucked up all of my lifts being totally immobile for awhile, my legs seem to atrophy quickly so 3 weeks of being useless means I lose at least 50 pounds on my deadlift and it takes months and months to get back to where I was.

Starting over is pretty depressing. I've had to do it a few times now so what I've learned is I had to accept that I'm going to have to do this from time to time and hopefully each time I start from a little more weight. I gotta reset my expectations and pretend that I'm PRing for the first time all over again. "

It came with a selection of patch designs ( circle, square, badge) pre loaded. It is difficult to evenly satin stitch a circle freehand so doing it in the hoop ensures perfection. I think there is a newer version that uses a USB stick instead of  the  proprietary cards. Please elaborate on your ""writing"" needs. If you already have a good sewing machine and want to get into machine embroidery I would recommend the PE-770 it is an embroidery only machine with a max hoop size of 5x7.

But in a world that's becoming increasingly automated, there just aren't enough jobs available for people to do, despite the fact that it's becoming easier and easier to feed, clothe, and house everyone.

The OP said:

&gt; The two of us have been living together in a rental house for roughly 2 years, and have been comfortable with joking and talking about marriage.

Then several paragraphs down:

&gt;The last present I got her was a laptop bag, which she had been talking about needing. She opened the present half-way, took one look at it and said something like, ""Oh, this isn't what I wanted at all..."" and just put it aside. I was hurt by her reaction and she seemed hurt by the gift.

There was zero connection made by the OP about the fact that they had been living together for 2 years, had a 6 year relationship, and that this is nearing make-or-break moment for a 28-year-old woman.  Either this relationship is going to end up in marriage for her, or she needs to get out now and find a man who actually loves her and wants to marry her.  She probably has been wondering herself if she should get out, even though she obviously still loves the guy.

So to the OP, if you don't see this relationship going anywhere permanent, just end it now for both of your sakes.  Neither of you is getting any younger, but you have more time on your side biologically speaking.  You might feel like you're playing catch-up, but she might feel like she has wasted much of her 20s on a guy who doesn't truly love her.  

And frankly, your actions and writing show that you don't, not really.  You broke up with her twice, and got mad at her for being upset about a lie you have hidden from her for SIX years.  Sure, from your perspective, she's mad at you for something that happened so long ago that it shouldn't matter.  You're still having to pay for some old sins, and shouldn't all the good times that happened since then be good enough?

From her perspective, you've hidden this huge thing from her all this time, something that she deserved to know back then.  You have irrevocably broken her trust.  What if she took you back only because you hid the truth from her?  It was only 6 months back then, she would not have lost much if she didn't get back together with a lying cheating guy who dumped her first.  What if she never would have gotten back together with you if she knew that you hooked up with some girl the day before your anniversary, before you even broke up with her? 

Just think about it.  And don't break her heart again this time just to try to get back together with her for your own selfishness and immaturity.  At least let her go like a man, if you can't treat her right."

I love GW2. It was the first MMO I ever played, is easy to get into, and looks amazing (part of it being the gorgeous art). But after roughly 100 hours playing it, I'm done. The last time I played was for the 2012 Christmas event, nearly a year after release.

I went back this Christmas, and nothing new had been added at all. Maybe ArenaNet has something big brewing we haven't heard about, I don't know, but there was zero new content. It seems like they're been using the Living Story as an excuse to avoid adding new content.

No.  The point is that a lot of people are stupid, and fall for this ridiculous ""narrative"" in the video.

&gt;you will find it hard to believe that the government of the USA would handle such an important matter in such a hapless way unintentionally.

You might find it hard to believe.  Doesn't mean it didn't happen that way.  I find it extremely easy to believe that government could screw things up as badly as they did, because the overwhelming majority of government actions are screwed up.  I mean, the fuckups that led to 9/11 and hampered some parts of the investigation *weren't even that major,* compared to other incidents in American history.

The video relies on a LOT of hindsight, guessing, and blatant lies to make a lousy point.

&gt;Something is wrong, and the fact that it was never questioned more publicly is only reinforcing that sentiment.

It's been ""questioned"" publicly for over a decade.  How much longer do we need?  When is anyone going to come out with *even one iota* of evidence linking anyone besides the 19 (or 20) hijackers, working under Al-Queda, to 9/11?  

TL;DR: How much longer are we supposed to pretend that people who don't accept the accurate description and causes of 9/11 are ""skeptics"" or ""just asking questions,"" before we can just start calling them ""idiots,"" or ""mentally ill""?"

slockley,AskReddit,1389732998.0,"This is an excellent example of the pro-choice viewpoint.  Well done.

And the answer is that Jill should not have to give up her liver to save Jack's life.

The difference between this example and the life/choice debate is that if Jill takes no action, Jack will perish naturally.  On the other hand, abortions of perfectly healthy fetuses do occur.  Abortion is an action taken by a person to destroy a fetus.

So if a fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.  Is there any other interpretation?  And can we not agree that murder is a valid limit to personal autonomy?  Likewise, if a fetus is not a person, then abortion is just surgery, and thus would fall under the sovereignty of the mother.

The whole debate seems to hinge on the single question: when does life occur?  All other issues regarding the abortion debate is secondary."

Examples: Getting your face fucked, being tied up so you can't move while someone has sex with just your cock/pussy, obeying verbal orders, being told what to wear to provide maximum visual stimulation.

Really anything can be that way. It's all about mindset and desire and trust. Just don't listen to your friends about what you shouldn't do. What do they know about what makes you happy? Make up your own mind. It's not for everyone, but it can be extremely fun."

&gt;dildo in the kitchen sink

Oh god this reminds me...a few weeks after my bf and I started dating, his dad was over at his place helping him change the carpet in his bedroom. His dad went to move the bed aside, and my giant, hot pink, vibrating dildo (""the thumper""), still covered in a used condom, rolled out from underneath the bed and all the way across the floor of his bedroom. Neither of them said a single word, and his dad politely looked away while my bf hastily picked it up and hid it away. And then they just resumed working on the carpet as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.

My boyfriend was absolutely mortified. As was I, when I went to meet his parents for the first time, and had to look his father in the eye. It didn't help that my bf had previously told them that our relationship started out as a drunken one night stand between strangers. : /

myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1389733211.0,"Let's first acknowledge that you were completely wrong about your original assertion. I understand TRP completely and still disagree with it. Others ITT have also accurately described TRP.

You are wrong.

&gt;The Red Pill purports to have the actual truth about sexuality and gender, and offers advice on how to best manipulate it for your own goals. This truth is that men and women have very different romantic and sexual habits from each other, but mostly similar habits amongst themselves.

The hubris of this blows me away. A collection of armchair sociologists have figured out human nature better than any expert in the field? Come on. Look at the inane ramblings of someone like Roosh. He's got it all figured out? TRP has the same scientific weight as any other conspiracy theory.

&gt;Women are ""hypergamous"", meaning that they will always try to get the most attractive man possible to breed with and the most resource rich man to commit with, thus ""alpha fucks beta bucks"". This phenomena is still carried out in modern culture.

This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of why people cheat. I've never met a woman so callous as to fit the alpha fucks beta bucks narrative. Most of the time it is an exit strategy sabotaging the relationship. This is true of both men and women.

I could keep going point by point, but it doesn't really matter. Demonstrably, people *do* understand TRP, and largely *do* disagree with it's ridiculous ""findings""."

mmp31,technology,1389733309.0,"&gt;Obviously there was no internet when the Constitution was written. The comparison was just to demonstrate that not everything the government does gives them power in a negative way. The government has a legitimate role in upholding human rights and ensuring fundamental freedoms?

OK, well it's my right to enter into a contract with an ISP that throttles my Internet, and you don't have the right to tell me that I can't do that. By your own admission, the federal govt has no Constitutional authority to do that.  So if you want the federal gov't to have the authority, get Congress to amend the Constitution.  Don't just ignore the Constitution because amending it is too inconvenient for your current political agenda.

&gt;Your characterization of it being a voluntary contract where the customer endorses throttling is naive. 

If they sign the contract then they voluntarily agree to the terms.  How is that naive?

&gt;What if Comcast is the only internet provider in the area the person lives (which is true in many parts of the country)? 

Then you question why they're the only ISP in the area and take steps to address that issue.  You don't use the force of gov't to change the terms of a contract simply because YOU think it's unfair.  

&gt;What if all ISPs force people to agree to similar terms? 

ISP's can't force anybody to do anything.

&gt;Is it really realistic to expect customers to refrain from signing up for any internet use, which most people need to conduct business and keep in touch with family and friends, on the basis of this one issue?

gravvs,PurplePillDebate,1389733492.0,"The Red Pill is a way of understanding cis heteronormative gender relations. It views relations as an exchange of power both between members of the same sex and members of the opposite sex. In this structure power is almost never divided equally. Only members of the same sex can have equal power, but this is rare and undesirable. 

For both men and women power translates into (among other things) being able to acquire desirable members of the opposite sex. For both this means physically attractive partners. For men this also means the ability to have multiple sex partners at once. It also means that they are able to direct the way that their partners act. For women it means being able to find a man who will take care of her financially and give her and their children a good life. No matter how much power she has, she can't control any aspect of his behavior other than fidelity when it is a monogamous relationship. 

These conservative values come from on Victorian gender roles. These gender roles, and the way that power functions within them are claimed by members of TRP to be biological. It is often stated that there are certains 'facts' or 'truths' about power and attraction based on biology. 

The use of word 'truth' when describing power relationships within the TRP's philosophy indicates that members of TRP believe that they are part of the philosophical movement of Skepticism. This means that they believe that they are pulling back the curtain and revealing how culture and society is actually functioning. The skeptic that they would probably identify the closest with is Nietzsche. 

Some specifics about what gives men and women power within the TRP structure. 

Men gain power from/are attractive for:

* physical traits
* money
* power
* confidence
* aggressiveness /assertiveness
* the ability to dominate
* aloofness
* being stoic/not showing emotion
* their ability to demonstrate these traits by being disrespectful/degrading 
* their ability to manipulate other people's behavior—including their partners
* having thick skin
* having a high number of sexual partners
* charisma/social skills
* doing what they want regardless of what their partner tells them

Women gain power from/are attractive for:

* physical traits
* vulnerability
* passivity
* skills as a homemaker
* having a lower number of sexual partners
* doing as their partner tells them

The most fundamental aspect of The Red Pill Philosophy goes back to the idea of truth. If you've taken the Red Pill you believe that this system is how all of society works, and that all members of society are functioning within the Red Pill whether they know it or not. It's a state of being/state of awareness more than anything. They are playing to the average and any contradictory experiences are outliers. 

edit:

Something that I've left out. Also important to this system is that women have been gaining power in society through deception. While feminism was initially important for the past years it has abandoned it's egalitarian ideals. It actually seeks to oppress men and give women power at the expense of men.

Women and a lot of men are also unaware of the impulses that drive them. We don't know what we want, or lie about it. TRP focuses on honesty of intention. Women might think and say that they want a certain kind of male, but in reality the traits that I've listed above are the traits that she's truly attracted to. Men too might think they're attracted to other kinds of women, but they really just want a submissive, sexually attractive women.

According to TRP a lot of women know exactly what they want and have been gaming the system for years. They use men to climb the power structure. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but TRP advises how to identify these kinds of women and play their own game against them. On the whole TRP considers itself amoral. There is no such thing as right and wrong, but there is appealing and unappealing. 

This goes back to promiscuity. There is nothing immoral about girls sleeping around, but TRP believes that girls with a high number of sexual partners don't make good long term partners. "

ZapActions-dower,Music,1389733627.0,"It's really not.  It's more like this:  alcohol.  You've got drinks in general, then you go down to specifics:  liquor, liqueur, wine, beer, that sort of thing.  Then you can subdivide more:  white and red wine; lagers, ales, pilsners, etc. for beer.  Let's say rock/guitar heavy music in general is beer, while metal is specifically ales.  This is equivalent to calling Judas Priest an IPA (which is very bitter,) when in fact it is a a Brown Ale (which is not.)

Now, people that aren't into beer or only drink lager (the most common American beers are lagers, so this will be our rock analogue) don't really care about the differences in ales.  But people familiar with the genre will know the distinctions and more importantly know what they like and don't like.  There's some quality of that subset that sets it apart from others under a more general heading, and this helps people find what they like and stay away from things they know they don't.  For me in beer, IPAs are too bitter for my taste, so I have no desire to drink them.

Having one big heading or misusing terms doesn't help anyone.  If you just have a big aisle that says ""BEER"" with no sorting or classifications on the boxes, how could you know if what you are getting is something you'll like?  Only in this case, it's more like a huge library with no sections, just all the books ordered alphabetically.  If you know exactly what you are looking for and who it's by, it doesn't effect you much.  But if only have a general idea, you'll be sorting through hundreds of books you have no interest in.  It doesn't cost you anything but time to browse around, but it's super inefficient and you'll have to sift through tons of stuff you don't like in search of something you do.  Do you get what I'm saying here?"

Re: settling, when you have small kids, it's not about what you want, it's about what's best for the kids.  By getting a place in a good school district, you are laying the groundwork for their future.  That is something that is priceless, and is impossible to repair if you mess it up.  You can always move up to a bigger house later when circumstances change, but you only get one chance at the formative years of your kids' childhood.

Also, speaking from experience, a huge place is a nightmare with toddlers.  We just downsized (this required writing a letter of explanation to the lenders, as apparently it is unheard of for people in their 30's to move to a smaller/cheaper house), and it has been awesome.  It's a lot easier to keep the place clean and keep track of the kids, and much cozier. "

Great windowed, mATX mid tower. Not the most compact but it looks excellent. Everything inside is black with metallic/gold accents, and the big white fans on the CPU cooler draw attention to the heart of the build. Not to mention it's probably the best air cooler you can get that isn't hideous *cough*noctua*cough*. The PSU and case you picked are kind of overkill for a single-GPU system, and that mobo is egregiously overpriced. IMO it doesn't look that good, either. "

tjmjnj,AskReddit,1389733866.0,"Well, for starters as a society they take care of each other through nationalized health care systems that work and are less expensive to the person needing care than much of the world. As you know healthcare costs in the US are the highest in the world yet we do not have the highest life expectancy, so they have that going for them. And I might add that is pretty much a top level society thing, sort of No 1 on the list of creating a good society. 

As I mentioned earlier their infrastructure which supports their society is superior to ours. And when I say infrastructure I am speaking of the things in place for public use that make their lives better. Public transportation, recreational spaces, governmental support, subsidies, hell even proper signage on their roadways (it's a pet peeve of mine) road signs in NJ are horrible at best. 

Also, because of traditions. There is something to be said about a society that is steeped in tradition, it seems to bleed into other aspects of their lives. Take care of the elderly, don't disrespect the elderly, be honest, do good, etc. I know it's not all lily white but honestly I think their traditions make them better people, it seems to help with their moral compass so to speak.

As long as the reader understands the writer, despite the latter's clumsiness, then I don't see how a ""baby with the bathwater"" approach benefits anyone. 

There are a lot of reasons why I can see that rejecting the manuscript -- despite the presence of solid research -- would ultimately screw-over the MS student, and not teach the PI a ""valuable"" lesson. It might be the case that he/she has an adviser that is very ""hands-off"" when it comes to teaching writing skills -- which is VERY common in science programs, especially at the MS-level of study. At this level of study, a PI is more concerned with training students on technique, methodology, equipment, data analysis, record-keeping, all while keeping the student motivated... everything else is secondary. Since academic science writing is often times very unintuitive and difficult to learn, it makes sense to save the training for students who have demonstrated they are capable of moving forward (e.g. passing MS research or qualifying exams), especially if this all plays-out within a large laboratory. It'd be one thing if OP wanted to reject the manuscript due to poor data and interpretation... it's another thing to tie-up the career progress of an MS student who is still cutting-their-teeth on research, and trying to get a clear handle on what's being taught in the field.

I am 50 now, and my wife, my daughter and I love to watch anime. In fact, my first submission to reddit was about [how I brought up my daughter exclusively on anime](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/myq4v/iama_diehard_anime_fan_who_has_raised_his_8yr_old/).

I was a big fan of Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and the like when growing up, but over the years, I had no time to watch cartoons at all (or any other thing, for that matter). I had a very bad impression of anime before I ever watched one. Guess I confused them with the style of the [""Love is ..."" cartoons](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-URDLEB-Pd80/Tl05TbdEF2I/AAAAAAAABLY/VNCXIohj4UA/s1600/love-is.jpg) which I hate.

So, years, or even decades, went by without me watching anything.  A stressful job kept me from doing much besides working, relaxing and sleeping. After my daughter was born and turned three, I was looking for some sensible entertainment for her. My old love for cartoons was not forgotten, and the fact that Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi) got an Oscar piqued my interest.

That's why I bought my first Ghibli movie, and I was absolutely delighted. Shortly after that, I bought some more Ghibli, and started to look into shows, beginning with Azumanga Daioh. The more I saw, the more I liked. To this day, my ringtone is the short break jingle of Azumanga Daioh, and we all watched more. And more. And more.

One day, I realized that I don't need much more for my happiness than a happy family, some friends and the option to watch anime whenever I want.

After reaching a certain age and making some life decisions like getting self-employed / small business owner, I decided that I can afford to give zero fucks about the opinion of others. My office decoration are three framed cels of Lina Inverse from Slayers. I am not addicted to Anime, but there is no reason for me to stop watching them either. This made me visit Japan, take up Japanese lessons, develop an interest in Japanese cooking and Asian cinema in general. I even try to create a business project which has a strong Japanese theme at the moment. 

To sum it up, anime has changed my life. In a major, positive way. It is an art form for me which helps me relax, shows me always new, interesting things and enrichs my daily life. And I am fortunate that my family shares this interest. Sometimes, when I face some obstacles, the right series even gets me back on track quick.

I hope I can keep this up until I am ready to kick the bucket one time in the very, very distant future. 

PS: +1 for Nodame Cantabile to OP. One of the most uplifting anime for my wife and me. We also liked the live action show of it."

Skyler827,Bitcoin,1389734076.0,"Ok, let me get this straight: This is a new way to generate a master private key, that can be used to generate any number of bitcoin private keys, and a master public key, which can be used to derive (and pay) any number of bitcoin addresses.  When someone wants to pay, they look at the master public key, generate a random number, do some crypto-magic, and get a bitcoin address that is statistically impossible to collide with any other address nor publicly associate with the published master private key.

I think that is correct, but answer me this:  How does the owner of the master private key figure out when an address he has never seen before gets a payment, that he has received money?  If it is sufficiently collision resistant, there must be bajillions of possible addresses.  Does he do some kind of hash of every transaction in the blockchain?"

DivineVodka,AskMen,1389734080.0,"Do not talk to women who have gotten out of a relationship.  Especially if they are hurt over this or saddened it ended.  There is nothing to gain here go and find someone who is worth your time and effort.  I have talked with girls who recently came out of a relationship and every time it's just a huge rollercoaster not knowing what they want at the moment then as soon as they reach home ""I miss you :((( I want you close to me""  and I always just stop and look up and say ""really?"" to myself.  I reply very seriously, so nothing can be taken as a joke and proceed to fade away.  If they call me out on it then I explain why I am no longer interested and fading was just a better solution because of her recent breakup.

Let's go again.  Stop talking to women who have come out of a relationship they do not know what they want in my experience.  A matter of fact when you stop texting her SHE WILL respond and reach out to you because you were something to comfort her ( if she said she's interested).  Ignore this and move on with your life she just wants security.  I have dealt with way too many women like this trust me when I say nothing ever good comes out of this.

Lastly, don't chase women.  Now if you get some thrill out of the chase as a few men do then by all means do you.  If you don't get a thrill stop chasing, stop sending text's constantly essentially stop any thought in her head as coming off as you need her.  This is not me saying to play games it's me saying don't do anything to come off as desperate/clingy.  Invite her out and that's it if she doesn't even reply she's just disrespectful and is seriously not worth any amount of your day.  You obviously like the person and you're kidding yourself that you don't want that date.  If you would come here and ask this question it means you want something from her whether that is sex or not I don't know.  If she was a regular friend then 100% this wouldn't bother you.  You don't need to chase women, they are plenty of women who won't play games with your head ( whether that is intentional or not)."

At the same time, the fact that she's still a virgin despite the circumstances is undoubtedly an asset - potentially a valuable enough one for him to actually keep it in his pants. 
So I'm not immediately concerned for her at the moment, more curious as to what he's actually planning, and to what degree she'll end up taking some initiative and steering things herself.

I guess you are also in favor of repealing food safety laws, child labor laws and anything else not specifically spelled out in a hundreds-year old document. But guess what, we are not (thankfully) living in that world, so it seems strange to draw the line with this one issue.

My opinion on those issues is irrelevant to the point, which is that you need to amend the Constitution instead of just ignoring it.  The only unrealistic thing about demanding that your government obey its own laws is expecting that it would ever actually do that.

&gt;And how does one address this issue, absent any kind of government regulation?

Who is to say that government regulation isn't the cause of it? Almost every monopoly in history has been created by governments directly assisting businesses in some way or another, and I suspect that ISP monopoly is no exception.

&gt;Which is why all of your arguments completely fail to solve the problem. And you end up with the status quo of corporations imposing their rules on people, which is not pro-freedom at all.

The problem is not that ISP's are allowed to do that, the problem is lack of competition. And they're not imposing anything on anybody, they can't send a cop to your door to arrest you if you don't agree to their contract.

Without a few big exclusives and/or most or all of the AAA licenses, I really don't see it ever taking off.

TheMeerkat,buildapc,1389734441.0,"&gt; Am I crazy for wanting that 4.1GHz quad-core processor? It's expensive, but as a developer I do some pretty CPU-intensive stuff, and I want a high performance rate regardless of the number of threads (most programs I know of take little or no advantage of multiple threads). Should I sacrifice 1GHz to save $50, for example?

No, but four cores is really the standard now for moderate-intensity apps, and MHz isn't as important as architecture. APUs -- ""accelerated processing units,"" one of which is the one you selected -- are not recommended, however, for your specific use profile. APUs are actually low-end CPUs with low-end integrated GPUs intended for light home use or, at the highest levels, very budget low-settings gaming builds. It's also actually on the inexpensive side of CPUs.

&gt; Is one RAM card as good as two? Google suggests I won't notice a difference. Motherboard only has two slots for RAM and I want to leave one open in case I want to upgrade in the future (8GB should do it for now). Google and PCPartPicker don't mention anything about whether the two-slot MSI FM2-A75MA-P33 Micro ATX FM2 requires parity.

Depends on what type of memory channeling the motherboard uses. Your motherboard is actually dual-channel, so both should be filled at any one time to maximize performance. Most motherboards nowadays, regardless of modules supported, are dual-channel.

&gt; Will this build or a similar one allow me to get a small SSD for Windows and maybe some other programs? If so, what capacity should I be looking for? I think 20GB should be more than enough for Windows. I also don't really know how to install these, nor how to partition a drive for just the OS, but I can probably figure that out when the time comes.

As long as you have a spare SATA port on the motherboard, it will support another drive. Typically, SSDs should be at least 64-ish GB, because you'll want your common applications on the drive as well.

&gt; I think a 1GB video card is sufficient for me, but what's the deal with price? A 1GB PowerColor AX5450 1GBK3-SH is only $35 ($20 with the newegg rebate), but a lot of 1GB cards appear to be around $100, and it looks like a lot of people are buying in the $50-100 range. I don't care about Crossfire support and the clock rate isn't a whole lot bit higher on the more expensive ones. Will I regret getting the cheap one later? Can it handle the large monitor (19201080 chosen, but I could live with 1600900).

The 1GB refers to video memory, and much like the CPU, it's a far less important number than the GPU's chipset. The 5450 is so cheap because it's going to be absolutely worthless for gaming... or any use beyond ""basic home Facebook machine,"" really. It's only intended for CPUs that don't have an integrated GPU, because you need *some* form of video output. It's also three generations behind. The GPU integrated on your CPU is actually significantly better than it, despite it not being great to begin with.

Skipping five for just right now, because this build is going to have to be completely redone for your needs.

&gt; Is my CPU cooler going to be enough? I don't care about noise, so I can always install a bunch of extra fans later, right? I threw one in for good measure in gauging the price. Will a 200mm fan even fit in that case?

You don't need an aftermarket cooler if you're not going to overclock (which I don't recommend you do right now), particularly if you care not for noise level.

Skipping seven for the same reason as five.

I genuinely appreciate all the research you've done, but it hasn't lead to a very good build for your needs. I mentioned that your build will need to be redone, and I'd like to help you with it, but first: would you like to discuss anything I've mentioned, or do you need anything explained further in-depth?"

BullsLawDan,videos,1389734525.0,"&gt;I think there's a lot of noise surrounding 9/11, but that it's likely people used it to their own advantage 

Using it to their advantage after the fact? I think that's pretty well established and everyone agrees many groups have done that.

&gt;insurance fraud

How would anyone use the situation for insurance fraud?  Everyone involved from an insurance standpoint lost - the owners, the insurance companies, the government.  Everyone.  Moreover, the Pentagon is a federal installation, which doesn't have any insurance implications, and an empty field in PA seems to be an unusual place to commit insurance fraud.

&gt;used as a precursor for war

A precursor for war with whom?  If it was a precursor for war, why wouldn't these alternately brilliant/stupid conspirators make the phony hijackers Iraqi, or Afghani?  Why make the hijackers mostly Saudi when the Saudis are, and continue to be, our allies?

If these supposed conspirators wanted a precursor for war with Iraq, why didn't we find any WMD?  That would seem to make the whole thing worth it, no?  Why didn't we find a sinister envelope in Afghanistan saying ""9/11 plans"" on it?  Those things would be so ridiculously easy to manufacture in terms of evidence, in comparison to the 9/11 attacks --- where are they?

&gt;an easy way to get rid of controversal documents,

Again, the diversity of the attacked/destroyed buildings makes this ridiculous on its face.  What controversial documents were stored in Shanksville, PA?  Moreover, a group of plane crashes is an **unbelievably** and inescapably complex, overbearing, excessive way to do something that could be done by a $15 purchase from Office Depot or by dropping a lit match into a garbage can.  Destroying information could have been done by low-level, low-key break-ins that would kill no one, be investigated by only a few officers, and have relatively few moving parts.  It is simply ridiculous to think that 9/11 was a ""good"" way to destroy documents, if that was the goal."

crogi,WritingPrompts,1389734540.0,"A man lay in glass, the remains of a broken table. Feces had fallen from him and now pooled around his old yellowing legs. His wiry hair exposed on his bare legs as he sat in his underpants.           
His balding head caught the light as the sun rose and the cops watched as he lay there, dead and mostly naked. He had Viagra set aside and a bottle of gin on the floor, in his hands a balled up pair of Hello Kitty panties. The smell of blood flowed out into the room from his stained and caked chest, matted in dry blood. His throat torn open, his erection still visible.           
The cops circled the room and pitied the old man. One of the officers left the room, another wiped away a tear. “chief I...I can't look at this...” said one officer, welling up behind his tough facade.              
The chief waved, “Leave, feel free boys... It's a tough day at the office. I can not expect men made of stone.”              
The breeze rolled in from the gaping window and the ruffling curtains set the shadows in motions. The broken sunlight glistening on the blood and glass. “I wonder how much? I wonder what was the price?” said Chief Williams as he squatted over beside the man. He began gently stroking the mans hair. Looking over what was clearly the rape of a young girl.                
“Raped, Chief... hell even the murder... Free! No charge, not from this sort, but for a young girls body, pervs would pay her weight in gold,” said one of the officers.

Euryleia,starcitizen,1389734797.0,"Adding extra hardpoints to an Aurora does not make it a Hornet.  :p

As I see it, you can add a jump engine to an LN to make it a good LX, or you can just save some money and buy an LX to begin with.  You can't add extra hardpoints to an LX, but it probably wouldn't be a good idea anyhow -- just save the money towards a ship better designed for that role.  Without the game being playable, it's very hard to tell, but I strongly suspect that the LX is good at what an Aurora is meant to be (light versatile explorer), while the LN is not as good at what the LN is trying to be (combat ship).  But I very well could be underestimating the LN.

In any case, my biggest problem withthe LN is that it's a more upgradeable version of a ship that you're more likely to replace than upgrade, thus spending more for that upgradeability is wasted.  If you can get an LN for the same price as an LX, then by all means, go for it, but I wouldn't spend any extra money on an LN over another Aurora."

**FUCKITRANDOMSTORYTIME**

So me and this chick Sarah were doing Olympic-style sparring. If you've ever seen Taekwondo in the Olympics, that's the style of sparring we were going for. Now this was back before the AAU cleaned up a lot of the rules for that, but at the time our instructor was encouraging us to punch almost *downward* on our opponent. The logic was that we can punch to the body but not the head, and the collarbone breaks easy. So if we just land a solid hid right on the collarbone, our opponent is injured and cannot fight, it was a legal technique, we win the match.

Well I'm maybe ten at the time but large for my age. Sarah was probably sixteen or eighteen. Idk - she was older, but size wise we were comparable.

I really can't remember the details but somehow both of us busted up our knuckles. We also kept landing punches in each other's throats. Every time we were pushed to just keep going. So by the end of it, we're both feeling like complete fucking death, we've got blood covering our hands and throats, we can't breathe well, and while we're not mad at each other we want to fucking murder each other. If that makes any sense."

So in my case, the best I can ever hope for to live in my kid's country, is a foreign residence status which can be revoked quite easily. 

That's really not that bad compared to others though, I have family members born and raised in Taiwan, but were not able to become Taiwanese citizens. Which provided a tough situation for them at age 18 - leave the only country they'd ever known, or try for a student visa. Since they couldn't legally work under their status, the only real option was to leave the country and get a degree that would enable them to get a work visa to go back as foreign residents in the country they thought of as their home. Some people would blame the parents for that situation, but for the kids, its a fucked up situation, they sure didn't ask to be born there, to them it's just home."

LinguistHere,paradoxplaza,1389734861.0,"I'm a new player, so the vast majority of my overall playtime has been invested in my current Korean ironman campaign.

I think the clear best moment for me was gaining naval superiority over the Spanish in the Pacific ocean. My diplo tech was still far behind, but I had several galleons and a massive trade fleet. During a holy war the Spanish declared on me, I combined all my naval forces, rolled a good admiral, and managed to completely destroy their invasion fleet. (They shattered and started to go toward a friendly port, but a few days later, we suddenly engaged in combat again-- I don't know how-- and it was an immediate total victory.) 

I also captured a number of vessels with technology superior to my own, further enhancing my new naval dominance. 

After decades of helplessness in the face of Iberian aggression, it was damn good to bite back.

//

Alternatively, my worst moment as the Koreans involves the Portuguese. I was going to invade Dai Viet, but it turned out that Portugal was their ally. (I forgot to check alliances.) Portugal shattered my invasion fleet, which then retreated to the harbor of Hainan island, depositing my ~30 unwesternized regiments onto the island and pinning them down under a blockade. The Portuguese sent their own army ashore and wiped my forces out to the man with their superior weaponry."

i_lick_telephones,AskWomen,1389734901.0,"For me, I just struggle with understanding how a woman could not align herself with feminist views. I don't care anymore if she calls herself a feminist, but to not desire complete equality is completely lost on me. I know I get lots of flack for not understanding/respecting other women's opinions, but in my heart of hearts, it doesn't make sense to me why someone would not desire something to important and so crucial for their gender. And even taking steps that defy that equality and doing things that hinder that movement. I'm not talking about choosing to be a housewife or wearing a dress and makeup. That's completely fine. I'm talking about voting to put people in power who so obviously have ridiculously traditional views on women that do not support women's equality to men.

As someone who is supposed to view everything through a sociological lens, I am paid to say that it's more (if not all) nurture than nature.

_masterofdisaster,nfl,1389734905.0,"Yeah, they did real well. Pryor only had the worst passer rating in the NFL other than Geno Smith. The only reason Pryor was relevant was because of his running ability, and we saw how much he struggled when he couldn't run. McGloin is someone who, yes, could be a starter, but needs development. So say the Raiders don't take Bortles. We have McGloin, who would be 32nd in passer rating if he qualified, as our QB. In a stacked AFC West, we win 4 games again at best. Dennis Allen gets fired, probably Reggie Mckenzie, and now were fucked up again. If McGloin shows some promise, we shop him on the market.

I also don't understand your logic on how Bortles had one overhyped game. Maybe were thinking of a different person, but I've been watching Bortles since UCF played in the Beef O'Brady's bowl last year. I could immediately tell that he was good, and the commentators would not shut up about him. Remind you, this was before anybody knew who he was.

nerdscallmegeek,Eugene,1389735200.0,"I moved over 1000 miles with my cats before. Get harnesses for them and leashes, good ones they can't wiggle out of. I suggest getting them used to the harnesses sooner rather than the day of the big move. 

Make sure someone is holding onto them securely anytime you open the car door or even roll the window down far enough for then to squeeze through. your cats are gonna be a bit freaked out with the move and will most likely try to bolt out of your car and disappear if they get the chance. seriously, I lost a cat this way as a child, even if they seem calm at the time you know how fast they can be. 

Depending on how big your car is and how you feel about putting a litter box in there, you're gonna want to take frequent stops to take them on their leashes for a little walk.

 

As for apartment searching, I'd say either craigslist or zillow are your best bets. Have a map of the city handy when looking. 

Steer clear of glenwood and campus area. Any numbered street from 9th to 28th on the east side is campus area (E 15th ave is the heart of the campus crap housing)  

Whitaker neighborhood is good if you're a hippy on a budget (or a crackhead, either or) 

I'd say coburg area, friendly neighborhood, college hill (not to be confused with campus) and goodpasture area are good neighborhoods to look into that have a relatively low crime rate and are more family oriented instead of being more catered to late teen college students like a good portion of our town is due to the university.

I'm not sure what your rent budget is so I can't really help you with specific places. 

Good luck!"

Apparently these neighborhoods become isolated when the water from the lake to the left rises over the existing road and the lake drains into the ocean, which is apparently a regular occurrence.

The city's mayor expects that besides better serving those communities, the bridge and paving works that have been done in surrounding areas will increase tourism to his town.

How is TRP as hateful as genocide? They don't propose killing anyone, and they don't hate women. 

&gt;So because I'm attractive, I'm not allowed to have a position on gender dynamics?

Yes, that's basically it.

&gt; I'm sure if I told you I was an attractive woman who believed in the Red Pill, you would react differently.

No, I'd find your opinion equally illigitimate.

&gt;But because I'm a feminist, you just want to discredit my opinion.

No, I discredit your opinion because not only are you an attractive woman who has no business discussing these topics, but I highly doubt you're as intelligent as you think you are because everytime I speak to you, you demonstrate an acute inability to think three-dimensionally. 

You sound like the kind of person who got through her education by being exceptionally skilled at regurgitating data isntead of actually learning how to analyze and think congruently. 

&gt;I have no idea what you mean when you say feminism is fascist in implication.

Feminism = A social movement creating an overtone characterized by the perpetuation of victim mentality amongst otherwise perfectly equal or otherwise advantaged individuals (women) for the purposes of accruing social, political, and judicial privileges for women at the detriment of men due to a spiteful, though expected reaction to their poor performance in socially Darwinian meritocracies.

^That is more often than not fascism in practice, especially perpetrated by the Nazi party. 

&gt;I'm going to have to look that up. I thought the marriage rate was higher, and the divorce rate is definitely at 50% or over.

I looked it up the last time you tried to site that during an argument...lol

&gt;When it comes to getting married or finding a partner for life, very few people are unable to do so.

This is a cognitive dissonance based belief, sprung from your life of constant validation and sexual advances made unto you. You can't imagine people not having partners because you can't imagine yourself not having constant access to partners.

&gt;So, if I respect a man as an equal, but not as someone superior to me, am I treating him like an alpha male?

If you want to impress someone, or otherwise sponge value from them, he's more often than not alpha, because his belief of you holds value you are attempting to earn. No one wants to earn anything from anyone they believe is below or equal to them, at least, initially.

&gt;That's not true, there's a ton of middle ground, and it probably varies among individuals, based on different circumstances.

That's literally what I just explained...

&gt;I probably do, I'm not denying that. But what I'm saying is that it's a subconscious thing. So if I say the guy is funny, he is legitimately making me laugh, even if he isn't funny to most others.

The fact you said it's subconscious validates pretty much all TRP theory. "
franklin_bluth,politics,1389735296.0,"There is a durable, widespread belief that much of today’s unemployment is rooted in a skills gap, in which good jobs go unfilled for lack of qualified applicants. This is mostly bullshit, based in part on self-interest and a misreading of government data.


Unemployment is also stubbornly high - 7.5 percent in June (most recent stats I could find). That's a ratio of 3.1 job seekers for every opening. So, when I say, when they can't find jobs after their ""training"", this is what I mean. The biggest problem in the labor market is not a skills shortage; rather, it is a persistently weak economy where businesses do not have sufficient demand to justify adding employees. 


If a business really needed workers, it would pay up. That is not happening, which calls into question the existence of a skills gap as well as the urgency on the part of employers to fill their openings. Recruiting intensity is woefully low, evidenced in this [paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17782).


Moreover, I indicated earlier that I'm in favor of a negative income tax. So, frankly, I don't give a shit if people want to work or not. If they meet a certain criteria, cut them a check.

ANewMachine615,tolkienfans,1389735321.0,"So, for Tolkien's idea of free will, I highly recommend Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*. The Boethian idea of free will and predestination is that we view these things from within Time. God (and thus Eru and the Music itself) however exists outside of Time. There are some great, subtle parts of the Ainulindale that try to make clear this point that the idea of the Music is just a very complicated metaphor. For instance, there's a lot of talk of Iluvatar raising his hand, or the brightness of his eye, or the look on his face during the performance, but then we get the Ainur being granted sight **after** the Music is complete, and they are watching the Vision of the World. Before that, they were apparently blind, but somehow perceived God in a way that can only be described loosely through the metaphor of sight.

That is how Time looks to God, who exists outside of and independently of time. We're told that ""In the Beginning"" God existed, but really that was ""before the Beginning,"" at a ""time"" when ""before"" has no meaning because nothing has happened yet (and even ""yet"" and ""happened"" are meaningless). The existence of a time before Time is itself a metaphor for minds that are inherently steeped in time. From that perspective, God's Plan and the free will of the Children is perfectly compatible.

Melkor is a great example of this existence of free will with God's plan. First, Eru invites the Ainur to sing, saying

&gt;And since I have kindled you with the Flame Imperishable, ye shall show forth your powers in adorning this theme, each with his own thoughts and devices, if he will. But I win sit and hearken, and be glad that through you great beauty has been wakened into song.'

So, they're doing His Theme, and ""adorning"" it, but they're all extensions of His thought, so how can they come up with anything original? In other words, aren't their adornments predetermined? Apparently not -- apparently they're independent of Eru, or else why would they be invited to adorn it ""if [they] will""? Why not just say ""and these shall be the adornments Manwe makes, and these shall be the adornments Ulmo makes,"" etc.? Because they have independent existence and the capacity to change that which Eru has put into their minds. They are really separate from Eru.

Later, all of this seems contradicted by Eru's response to Melkor. Eru says

&gt;[T]hou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.'

So, Melkor can't alter the Music -- but he can try -- and he *does* alter the Music, because as we've seen, the Ainur are capable of doing so with their ""adornments."" So he can't alter the Music, but he can. He can try, but in trying he will just fulfill Eru's plan and fail. But even if he *doesn't* try the plan will be fulfilled, just in a different way -- ""adorned"" despite him.

Time is the limiting factor. We're humans, and we exist within Time inherently, and cannot conceive of a state without it. But if we could, we would see that free will and predestination can coexist peacefully. That's the Boethian idea of free will, and the one Tolkien largely held himself and wove into the fabric of Arda.

__________________________________________

Now, as to Men, the way I've always interpreted our lesser connection to the Music as being the direct tools of Iluvatar. Whereas Iluvatar acting for the Elves has to go through intermediaries, he intervenes directly in the lives of Men. Ulmo sets up Tuor; Iluvatar pushes Smeagol off the Cracks of Doom.

&gt;they should have a virtue to shape their life, amid the powers and chances of the world, beyond the Music of the Ainur, which is as fate to all things else; and of their operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and the world fulfilled unto the last and smallest.

*""Of there operation. . . the world [shall be] fulfilled unto the last and smallest.""* They are Eru's way of enacting his own will on the world, without the ""adornments"" of the Ainur.

Hatewrecked,worldnews,1389735339.0,"If you've ever cleared anything from your browser history, you'd know why people value privacy. Privacy is a great concern to a lot of people not necessarily because people have things they really want to hide, but rather because they do not want to share things with corporations or the government. I don't support the government spying plan because I personally don't think it's okay for a government to snoop on it's own citizens. I don't want them to be able to read my emails, even if it's just the emails sent between me and my girlfriend. I don't want them knowing what I look up on YouTube, even if it's just videos of cats with hats. I don't want them to be monitoring my online spending habits, even if I'm just buying bicycle helmets. I don't support their snooping because I don't want to live in a world where the government is monitoring me. I'm not paranoid about it and I'm not sitting here with a big tin foil hat on my head, but I personally don't believe any government or corporation should be logging anyone's online browsing. This should especially be of interest to people who watch porn, download copyrighted material(I'm not going to accuse you of it, but if you're like most people then you probably do it too), or subscribe to political/religious related news pages or magazines. 

All that would be enough for me to say ""no"" to government/corporate spying, but we now know for a fact that the way they use our information goes much deeper than that. The major worry is that not only will the government and corporations collect our data, but also they will soon give your collected data to any other corporations who pay a price. We now know that this is indeed the case. We now know that your online activity is a commodity which is bought and sold by advertising firms and analytic companies. We know that your information can easily land in the hands of anyone who wants it (think potential employers, insurance companies, etc.). 

And the biggest thing to me is this: it isn't hard to protect yourself, and you have nothing to lose by doing it. It's easy to opt-out of Chrome and go for something more private like Firefox or Chromium (not sure about Chromium though). It's easy to encrypt your information. It's easy to install something like HTTPS Everywhere, DisconnectMe, or Peerblock. It's easy to use Bitcoin. It's easy to find a free VPN or tunneler (though not very useful). If you want to go the extra mile, you can fully encrypt all your information from your IP provider by buying a year's worth of a VPN for $40 and have a secure state of mind.

Lastly, /r/privacy has a [really good FAQ](https://pay.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index) which addresses everything you've brought up and how you can protect your information. I'm glad I found out about it. Believe me, up until recently I didn't care at all about privacy and I thought it was only paranoid people who cared that badly, but now I care a lot and I'm glad I learned about /r/privacy. "

BullsLawDan,videos,1389735474.0,"&gt;WTC 7 fell, for a majority of its collapse, at free fall into its own footprint,

This is a blatant lie and leads me to believe you are uninterested in reality.  The actual facts are that a small portion of the building fell at free-fall speed for a small portion of the collapse.

Even so, ""free fall"" does not equate to explosives, and does not explain why, if there were explosives in the building, the hundreds of firefighters who went inside did not report any, and the thousands of cleanup workers who were there for years afterward did not report finding a single piece of anything that gives physical evidence for the use of explosives.

&gt;WTC 7 was a text book controlled demolition

This definitely shows you are uninterested in reality.  A ""text book controlled demolition"" takes WEEKS to set up - I know, because I was involved in one before i finished school, when I worked for a contractor.  It took my whole summer for a 10-story building.  Moreover, the signs of a ""text book controlled demolition"" would be obvious to anyone who came within a quarter mile of the building for MONTHS in advance, let alone anyone who worked in the building.  

&gt;if you show any CD pro that video he'll tell you it was a CD. It has every hallmark.

paratactical,AskWomen,1389735582.0,"I think modern feminism in the US is problematic for me. I believe in equality between genders and while there are many countries in the world that have sincere injustice against women, I don't think America is one of them. That's not to say there aren't problems, just that they aren't as endemic.  I am more interested in legal equality than changing the media or society. I honestly think that we should be more concerned about socioeconomic disparity than gender disparity, at least in terms of American social justice issues. 

I can relate to a lot of complaints that I see coming from feminists on the internet - dick pics, being harrassed about what some stranger thinks my labia might look like, having my opinion invalidated because I'm willing to identify as female online. That shit is obnoxious. But it's not like those jerks can tell me I can't chose my job or where I live or my spouse. 

And I'm just sick of the idea that I'm supporting some evil empire if I happen to like football and find some rape jokes fucking hilarious. I'd rather self-identify as a badass c*** than a feminist and I feel like a lot of the feminism I see on the internet views that as just as bad as a sin against my gender or hating all women. 

Men and women are clearly different; their genitalia, average size, and various other physical characteristics. But it's about averages. Just because most men are stronger than most women doesn't mean that there aren't men who are weaker and women who are stronger.

Even if it wasn't his crotch, any body part purposefully rubbing up against another, the butt is an intimate body part that is akin to breasts and genitals. The butt is very close to the genitals as well. Throughout history, strangers rub their genitals on a stranger's butt to get personal sexual satisfaction. So even if he's not using this as a sexual gesture, his actions are mirror people who sexual assault using rubbing motions on a butt.

I just went to wikipedia for this: ""Sexual assault is any involuntary sexual act in which a person is threatened, coerced, or forced to engage against their will, or any sexual touching of a person who has not consented. This includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration), groping, forced kissing, child sexual abuse, or the torture of the victim in a sexual manner""

    He chanted a song of wizardry,

    Of piercing, opening, of treachery,

    Revealing, uncovering, betraying.

    Then sudden Felagund there swaying,

    Sang in answer a song of staying,

    Resisting, battling against power,

    Of secrets kept, strength like a tower,

    And trust unbroken, freedom, escape;

    Of changing and of shifting shape,

    Of snares eluded, broken traps,

    The prison opening, the chain that snaps.

    Backwards and forwards swayed their song.

    Reeling and foundering, as ever more strong

    The chanting swelled, Felagund fought,

    And all the magic and might he brought

    Of Elvenesse into his words.

    Softly in the gloom they heard the birds

    Singing afar in Nargothrond,

    The sighing of the Sea beyond,

    Beyond the western world, on sand,

    On sand of pearls on Elvenland.

    Then in the doom gathered; darkness growing

    In Valinor, the red blood flowing

    Beside the Sea, where the Noldor slew

    The Foamriders, and stealing drew

    Their white ships with their white sails

    From lamplit havens. The wind wails,

    The wolf howls. The ravens flee.

    The ice mutters in the mouths of the Sea.

    The captives sad in Angband mourn.

    Thunder rumbles, the fires burn-

    And Finrod fell before the throne."

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1389735774.0,"Are you sure you're truly 15-17% bodyfat?

No offense, but you may be carrying more fat than you had anticipated. Also, the first week or so will be a huge decrease in water retention due to reduced muscle glycogen. You may have lost size simply due to this. 

Anyway, to answer your question:

You can get extremely shredded, but you're going to lose muscle. Your diet approach will reach a point where you're returns are diminishing, and in order to lose more fat, you'll have to sacrifice more muscle as well. The most you can hope for is to *minimize* the muscle loss. 

As for the abs debacle, you may have very shallow insertions, either from genetics (determined by your tendinous inscriptions), or just a lack of mass in your abdomen. The deeper the 'caverns' between, the fatter you can be while still showing a little bit of separation. 

For example; I don't show separation in my abdomen until I'm sub-8% bodyfat (as measured by calipers).

Finally, if you're a graduate student, I would really look into Student Disabilities (ours is called Accessibility) Services.

BullsLawDan,videos,1389735943.0,"LOL... Richard Gage?

Let's break down what his *actual* ""organization"" consists of.

He has roughly 1,700 architects and engineers who signed a petition.  Assuming all 1,700 are legitimate - I know for a fact they are not - we know (due to dates of signatures) that nearly 2/3 of those signatures came **before** the NIST report and 9/11 Commission report were released.

And what did those 1,700 signers actually sign?  A petition, seeking a more thorough investigation into the events of 9/11.

How many of those 2/3 would still sign, given those reports?  Half?  1 in 5?

Even if they would all sign, do you know how many architects and engineers there are worldwide?  MILLIONS.  And he could only get 1,700 to sign this petition?

WalMart has 2.2 million worldwide employees.  If I had a petition on the internet regarding something WalMart should do for employees, and I could only get 1,000 or so of them to sign it, in 10 years of trying, what would you say about what was in that petition?  Would you say it was a worthy or valid cause?  Would you say it was well-supported by WalMart employees?  If you did, you'd be a fraud.

Richard Gage is a fraud."

Figuring things out as you go along can be fun, and as you said, ""adventurous"". Had a few snags on that trip. These asshole teens tried to rob me at knifepoint in Eastern Turkey in an area the US embassy specifically says they wont send employees to help you, so that was a downer. Because of the language barrier I accidentally went through outskirts of Kirkuk, one of the most dangerous cities in Iraq. During the few hours I was traveling, which included passing through Kirkuk, several car bombs went off there. The checkpoint into the city (checkpoints about every 40 minutes of driving) and the area around it was the most militarized place I've ever been, including border crossings. But it was the most eye opening trip I've ever taken. Absolutely incredible.

Thirdly, TBP is basically feminist blank slatist apologism. Convincing, or making an argument for Nice Guys being equally as disliked by you as they are by TRP is, as I said earlier, shaming victim for no other purpose than to feign comraderie amongst two people with diametrically opposing world views.

I say this because knees and wrists are serious business. Having either of those ruined can ruin your entire workout career/life.

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389736110.0,"I think you could make a pretty convincing case that Demarcus, Anthony Davis, Roy Hibbert and even Andre Drummond are performing as well or even better than Dwight Howard.  If Howard is the best of the bunch, he certainly hasn't distanced himself from those other guys.  

Whereas Howard once dominated the position because of his freak athleticism, his numbers have definitely come back to earth.  Since leaving Orlando his rebounding and defensive advanced stats point to a non-insignificant regression.  I think a lot of fans still remember him being very impactful on the defensive end, but the metrics show that he doesn't stand out amongst other top-tier centers on the defensive end or even on the boards.  

If you're an opposing coach, I'd say it's harder to gameplan against a guy like Demarcus or Hibbert than Dwight.  Hibbert is a game-changer on the defensive end and Demarcus can take over games on the offensive end.  Dwight may belong in the conversation about the best center, but he doesn't ultimately deserve the title of best center in the league. "

sleepyj910,exchristian,1389736283.0,"Reminds me of my fox news loving father-in-law.  Just can't resist taking potshots, and more interested in scoring points then actually understanding why others are different.

A man like that needs a paradigm change.  His whole ego is centered around the fact that he knows how the world works, and he simply has to point out stupidity and people will wake up.

I don't know the right answer, but he won't likely change without something different in his life.  How much you value his friendship is up to you, though good friendships usually involve people being able to discuss philosophy.

Sometimes you need something big a la American History X, like work that actually puts you into contact with minorities.  Other times you simply need to mock or question him until he realizes that he doesn't understand everything, and force him to do his own research instead of parroting his parents.

Maybe you start small, a criticism of a fundie preacher here, or creationist there.  Start where you're comfortable, and don't involve yourself in debates where you are not, or note the points he uses and research why he's wrong for the next time.  Use the Socratic method.  Ask questions that force him to reveal and defend his core beliefs, without exposing your own.  If done right, he'll enjoy talking about himself, but may expose his own flaws when you ask for clarification (not as an enemy, but as a curious person).

Definitely you should watch shows like 'Atheist Experience' and other debate forums so you are comfortable with insanity, and see how others deal with it.

I totally understand if it's too much crazy to handle, but that probably means you'll just drift away.  It's up to you if it's worth the hassle of hearing him defend his ignorance."

There is simply no reason to refer to the birth certificate for ""life-saving information.""

This is a document that must be changed in order for several states to change the gender on something as simple as a driver's license. This is a serious potential danger for trans people. They could be outed at any time. It's not just about anyone's feelings. Look up trans violence statistics. It's disturbing to say the least.

&gt;that doesn't explain the reason why this topic comes up about once a week on this subreddit and is discussed in hypotheticals regularly

I meant exactly such hypotheticals as ""jacked-up roided-out woman...running towards you with a knife"". When was the last time, and be completely honest here, because that's what I'm trying to point out, that you've had this scenario happen? Because you haven't. I know you haven't. You know why? Because it's a bullshit hypothetical. Now, if you could ask me a real question like ""what if your spouse came at you swinging her fists"" maybe I could have taken you seriously, but you proved my point to a t.

The question that gets asked here, time and again, is whether it's alright to hit a woman in self-defense. When people ask about men, they just say yes or no. And I will tell you the same, that if a man or a woman came at me in an attempt to injure me, I would try and get myself out of the situation rather than trying to punch someone. 

Let's also try and give an honest answer to your hypothetical. A person (doesn't really matter the gender when it's a ""jacked-up roided-out"" person) comes at me with a knife, I'm going to be even *less* likely to punch them. Wanna know why? Because they have a fucking knife. That's why I'm going to try even harder to get away from them and hopefully get help from law enforcement who would have a much better chance of stopping a ""jacked-up roided-out"" person with a knife. 

Don't come at me with bullshit hypotheticals when my entire point is to show that these threads are filled with bullshit hypotheticals. "

You will have better success if you count your calories and weigh yourself frequently. But it's not 100% necessary to see results. What it will do is help you figure out why you're not seeing the results you want though. For example if you trained and ate hard for 3 weeks, yet saw no progress, you could look back and see what you did wrong.

When you do this, watch each stage's TWR. Doesn't matter if you've got all the dV in the world, if your second launch stage is at 0.6 TWR you're not getting anywhere.

When launching, the KE screen will have a value under the Vessel tab (I think) for ""Atmospheric Efficiency"". You want it to be near 100% all the time. Adjust your thrust accordingly. This basically makes sure that you're spending exactly enough fuel to reach terminal velocity and no more.

Please ask if any of the terms is unfamiliar. You could probably do much worse than reading [this](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html) - it's a NASA engineer explaning concisely the main constraints that weigh on rocket design.

Frankly, sometimes I think that KE should be included in the base game. Not necessarily the dV/TWR counter, but at least the variables needed to calculate them - unless I'm wrong, the base game doesn't even calculate your rocket's mass for you.

I went with the mATX form factor because you can still get excellent performance and other than that it saves money on the mobo and case. A good windowed ATX case is going to be more like 120-150. Obviously if you want the flexibility to add a second graphics card then you should probably stick with full ATX. On the other hand if you want a nice, inexpensive, but well-designed white micro ATX case, check out the white Xion XON-560. It is only $30 after rebate from newegg. Despite being so cheap it's actually one of the better mATX cases you can get. It does use a lot of plastic rather than metal in the body, but it looks good IMO. http://pcpartpicker.com/part/xion-case-xon560wt Only drawback is it has no side window, but the side panel does have a huge vent you can put a nice big fan in or something. Honestly throw a good PSU in that thing and a 240mm side fan, and you should probably have no trouble doing a dual-GPU setup despite the cramped space. 

Unless you want to drop the 1080p monitors and get a 2560x1440 monitor, I would suggest sticking with a single video card. The 770 has more than enough horsepower to game at 1080p. I'm assuming with two monitors you will have one for gaming and the second for a backup display. That's another reason the Dell monitors would be good for you IMO, you can rotate them to vertical as well as adjust the height and pivot over a nice range. So you can have one in portrait and one in landscape if you want, or however you feel like arranging them.

""Had to"" and ""otherwise..."" suggests that you don't even want to go on a date, but that your friend almost forced you to and oh bummer, now you're stuck with this girl!

Just say your friend is going out on a date with a girl he likes and that you would love to make that a double date by going out with a girl you like too. That's sweet and gives her the feeling of being equal, not being required for a favor for some friend of yours.

If the same laws of physics/metaphysics apply as in his former universe, he will be stronger than anyone Batman has ever faced in that time and nigh indestructible, as well as able to fly and shoot ki bombs.

If he is stuck with *actual* laws of physics, he is just a great brawler with a not so brilliant mind.

In the second round, Batman should be able to win. He has at *least* the tenacity and strenght of will that Goku and Vegeta have, probably more. He would discard the time to train and fight crime. Probably set arkham into orbit with escape shuttles incapable of enough thrust to get out of orbit and stuff like that. When it comes to the actual fight and Batman has the exact same capabilities, speed, strenght etc., he will win. He can probably think of infinitely more uses of his powers than Goku ever did on the top of his hat.

I do agree about the board. It's a pretty painting, but the design/layout leaves something to be desired. I do really like that you can knock dice out from most spaces... so there's no ""I took this spot first, you can't have it"" aspect like in most worker placement games."

If a woman wants this pregnancy and wishes to be a mom, the fetus is already her child in her mind. She loves it like it were already born, even though it is still biologically, just cells.

flashmedallion,metalgearsolid,1389736782.0,"I'm of the opinion that the gameplay itself - the controls, the response, your wealth of options at any given time - is superb.

It's tight and refined, with a learning curve that culminates in smooth, precise responsive action. One of the best in the series on that front. It can be hard to get used to at first though.  In terms of an interactive set of verbs though, it's amazing.

On the macro level of the ""game"" element in isolation, you do have what seem like weird pacing issues and odd stretches of busy work or retracing your steps.  But these make perfect sense when taken with the narrative - And every MGS is like this in the macro sense... Maybe except for Snake Eater.

*The reason Metal Gear Solid is such an artistic achievement is because the gameplay is consonant with the story.*  They play off and reinforce each other and are two sides to the same coin. Most games have a story that for all intents and purposes has nothing to do with the players *experience*; only with their mechanical actions (if that).

MGS2 does this far more strongly than any other MGS title, which is part of the reason it's so disliked. But when you say you understand MGS2 is a work of art, and then try and talk about it in isolation from it's context, I kind of wonder if you do understand.

mandym347,Pathfinder_RPG,1389736904.0,"*How do I select my feats? How do i determinate how many i get?*

When I pick out feats, I first ask myself, what do I want this character to be good at?  What kind of approach to combat/RP do I want to take?  In your case, you say archer... so feats to help him to this end would include Point Blank Shot, Deadly Aim, Precise Shot, etc.  Also, if you want to be an archer type, why did you put more points into intelligence than dexterity?

*With my Int score of +3, do i get to add 3 more languages on to my know languages bar?*

Yes.  The racial section should tell you literally that if you possess a high Int score, then choose additional languages from the following list.  My DM also takes background and campaign area into consideration here, like if a language is not on this racial list but is tied to an area my character grew up, it would be allowed.

*Do any of my Ability scores affect anything other than skills?*
 
Scroll all the way to the bottom of this page (http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/gettingStarted.html) for a good list on what ability scores do.  Dex goes into a character's ranged attack roll; that's why I asked earlier why your Int was the higher score if you were making an archer.  (The charisma is good since you're a charisma caster, but it seems that Dex would be your secondary stat, not Int.)

*What is must have equipment i should buy? (Satchel, herbs, rations?)*

I always pick up some basics like backpack, rations, waterskin, tent, chalk, and empty sacks.  I also like to toss in a climber's kit (which contains the rope, pitons, crampons, hammer, etc. while giving you a +2 to climbing).  Little things can come in handy like a mirror (reflecting light as a signal), shovel, bag of chalk dust for a nice non-magic go-to for pesky invisibility types or finding tracks, parchment/ink/quill for writing messages or drawing maps, and so on.  Sometimes I pick up items for RP or class reasons, like an inquisitor having a set of manacles or a cleric having a healer's kit.  I always carry soap and a dagger on every character.  There are also cool items that are just fun to have, like a mithral waffle iron.  Generally, I look through the equipment lists in the handbook and ultimate equipment and see what might appeal to my character in terms of use, fun, class, race, and cunning-plan-making.

*When i add a skill point to a skill, by how much does this change my skill?*
    
When you add a skill point, I assume you mean adding a rank?  Just one, unless it's in-class for you and it's the first rank you're putting in, then three for training.

*What spells should i take for supporting my party?*

As an archer type bard, your best contribution to the party is going to be dispelling mind effects/illusions/etc. through bard abilities, buffing them with things like haste, and adding a bit of damage through your bow.  So, for spell selection, buffs and utility!  Some crowd control is great, too, like sleep/daze/charm person/hideous laughter/anything that takes away an enemy's action or ability to move or act.  My favorites also include things like Grease, Feather Fall, Glitterdust, Invisibility, Heroism, Silence (great vs. enemy casters), Dispell Magic, Slow,etc.

I think giving women (or any marginalized group) special treatment is the only way to achieve equality. If we just started mandating everyone be treated equally from now on, women wouldn't be able to get out of this ditch we're in. We're at a disadvantage...we need special programs and laws to help us specifically. We need to level the playing field by raising us up to the level of our male counterparts. When we're at that level playing field, we can truly maintain equality. Until we get that boost, it's just not going to compensate for the historic oppression of women.

&gt; More recently, however, increasing numbers of women have begun to smoke marijuana regularly. To some extent, this was attributed to the increasing participation of women in Rastafarianism, but the practice has spread to non-Rastafarian women as well. 
&gt; 
&gt; Not only are such women now grudgingly tolerated by their communities, many of the heavy-marijuana-users, particularly if they were Rastafarians, have been given the commendatory title of ""Roots Daughter."" 
&gt; 
&gt; Roots Daughters are described as women ""with a purpose,"" who can ""think, reason and smoke like a man"" and who are self-reliant and dignified. They smoke marijuana on a daily basis, in a manner not unlike that of their male counterparts, and continue to smoke during pregnancy and the breast-feeding period.

Total props to the research team that acknowledged something that significant. That's good science.

Daily story time.  When she's holding an object state what it is clearly. 'block' or 'ball'.  Whenever you do anything, say the 'verb'.  'bounce' if you are bouncing her, 'up' when you pick her up.  Start baby sign language.  Sign language words count as words.  If she starts pointing pay attention, she may be asking for you to sound out the object.  Babies will understand words far before they will speak them.

You should be fine, kids tend to have 'eureka' moments and suddenly do things they couldn't.

Its called *"" in mensa mea erant""*, which is Latin for ""the unlawful hope"", ""the evil hope"", or ""hope of destruction"" depending on the way you translate. 

It is a federal law that was enacted in 1931 passed as on add on to a budget bill for tank production, it was originally an executive order from Herbert Hoover in 1930 titled ""Executive order: I hate hope and poor people"". Since that time many democrats have attempted to overturn the federal law to bring chaos into our free lands, luckily every attempt has been shot down by our republican over lords in order to maintain order, hopelessness, and stocked private prisons in order to fuel the economy.

&gt;Should the cycle of poverty be allowed to perpetually continue by allowing people who can't afford children to keep having them and their children never getting an opportunity to raise themselves and having more children in poverty.

I'd agree, but the fertility rate in virtually all developed countries (including the US) is below the replacement rate, meaning the populations would slowly shrink were it not for immigration.  Also, define ""can't afford children,"" because if you asked 100 people to do so you'd get 100 answers.

Now when you have an ideology that is set up in such a way as to make yourself feel better by ""not being a Beta"" then you've created a completely insane way of living your life. It's a negative definition, which means you're constantly worried and/or anxious that you'll do something ""beta"". The nature of this definition is quite straightforward: it puts you in a box. It simplifies your life at the expense of **everything else**. Will you be happy in this 2x3 identity? 

Instead of creating your own identity you willingly embody a pseudo-identity. It's a defense mechanism, the pressure is too strong so you become polarized to the extreme. I know life is scary and complicated but don't shoot yourself in the foot by jumping on the hegemonic train.

**Lunch:**
prepared one week in advance: 3lbs of chicken thighs, 4 cups of broccoli, a can of kidney beans, and about 1/2c (before cooking) of wild rice split 5 ways.  I change up the seasoning from week to week, sometimes the beans (black beans with fajita mix).

**Dinner:**
Flank steak, sweet potato and brussel sprouts 3 times a week, beef chile with tortilla chips (salty store bought ones, yum) 3 times a week, and one cheat meal for a dinner.

Unfortunately, I eat separately from the family now... as the 80/20 meatloaf, no-protein/no-fat/all-carb pasta, and ""garbage disposal nachos"" meals no longer fit.  Its not all bad, the flank steak can be fajitas I just don't eat the tortilla.  Chile is a favorite, everyone joins in at least once per week.  The pizza around here SUCKS!!! so I don't miss that and we barely eat together from all of the running around anyway.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389737235.0,"I went to a school that was at the time globally ranked as a top engineering school, with some of the toughest electrical engineering and computer science programs.

The percentage of women gunning for those majors was tiny, and they pretty much validated a lot of stereotypes. Most of them were Jewish, East Asians, and some South Asians. (I knew only one regular white sorority girl who stood out like a sore-thumb. She was actually on the boxing team with me and was an exceptional minority within minorities. One of those ""alpha women"" who is constantly trying to break limits.)

... But they weren't unattractive to begin with. I don't know how you specifically would define femininity, but they definitely weren't bitchy or confrontational. They were quite reasonable people.

Their looks just didn't last past early freshman year.

Make-up and a healthy amount of sleep makes such a huge difference in a girl's appearances. 

They went from looking like dateable people to being pale-faced (sometimes with acne), sickly, sloppily dressed, tangle-haired, etc. (Most guys were the same way. There was one time I couldn't shower for 3 days because we were stuck in a lab. So I couldn't fault any of them for that.)

The reasons were:

1. Not enough time. The workload was back-breaking for the average nerd, even when these girls were getting extra assistance by lines of betas who praised the Lord every other day for the fact that there were actually women in the department.
2. They were praised with or without makeup. There was basically no incentive to doll up or even care about appearance.

In light of this, I think it's hard to say if they went into the major looking the way they do after graduating from it. I'd give them more of a chance. The only reason I didn't was because I was a betaman with myopic and overromanticized vision at the time."

It just seems so common to attack the very idea of workers lookign after themselves.

TryUsingScience,asatru,1389737257.0,"I'm a hard polytheist as well. I don't think I'd bother with any of this if I weren't. I believe the things we say and do when we pray and talk to our gods and offer sacrifices to our gods have meaning beyond the symbolic. If it were all only symbols it wouldn't be worth it to me.

I have to admit I'm also a bit frustrated at times with the atheists in our community. I used to believe that the tent is big enough for everyone, but I no longer believe the tent is big enough for people who, when I describe personal interactions I've had with the gods, think I am lying or insane. I'm fine if non-believers think that, but if you are going to pass the horn and share food with me I require a baseline level of trust, and thinking I am deluded or a liar betrays a distinct lack of trust."

ChangloriousBastard,nba,1389737269.0,"I wouldn't discredit Hibbert's contributions to the defensive end when it comes to naming who the best center is.  Indiana is a championship contender in no small part because of Hibbert's ability to anchor an ultra-elite defense.  Hibbert's play takes a good team and makes them a contender, which is more than both Cousins and Howard can say this season.  Would Indiana be as successful if you replaced Hibbert with Howard or Demarcus? It's unlikely. He doesn't share the same polish as DMC or Dwight, but he's an extremely talented and important NBA player.  

Dwight may be a better rebounder, but probably not by as much of a margin as you think.  Dwight's rebounding rate is 20.5 and Demarcus's rate is 20.1.  Demarcus actually rebounds better on the defensive end than Dwight, and the difference on the offensive end is easily explained by the fact that Dwight spends much more time around the rim than DMC.  

On the defensive end, Dwight blocks more shots but Demarcus gets more steals.  Even if you try to measure defense by another metric (defensive rating), Demarcus only gives up 1 more point per 100 possessions compared to Dwight.  

If I didn't look at the numbers, I'd easily say that Dwight is a much better rebounder and defender than Demarcus, but the numbers just don't back it up. I remember Dwight being a beast, and I think my perception of his current abilities still stems from my expectations of him to be a great player.  When I distance myself from that view, though, I see a player who isn't as good as I think him to be. "

Charging me interest when he lent me money a few times. Never gave me a gift or a card that shows his appreciation of me yet I continued to shower him with gifts he wanted.

I notice that men's judgment, if they care, it goes in one direction. Men certainly didn't start the ""real women have curves"" meme. We certainly haven't created a similar ""real men have curves"" movement for ourselves. Whether it is right or not, we often judge other men that are out of shape and we give accolades to athletes or just guys that have worked hard and got fit.

Women seem to judge in every direction. It would really suck to be told that no matter what you do, you are not a real woman, by your own gender no less. Encourage someone to get fit and you're fat shaming. Praise those with curves and you start a fat acceptance movement that distorts the very idea of a ""real woman"" into something legitimately unhealthy. It's all very confusing.

Hell, it's possible that the universe might not even be universally true but rather a holographic universe. You can try and break this down into a hypothetical philosophical discussion, but it's just denying facts to do so. Unless you have somehow discovered the secrets of M-theory and have been keeping the secrets of the universe to yourself, you might want to rethink your standpoint.

You absolutely could do what I do, you choose not to. Many people think the only answer to violence is violence, when often the truth is quite different. To prove my point, a week ago in a thread about fighting (though not related to women this time) a former security worker talked about [defusing the situation rather than fighting,](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1um6f2/how_do_you_usually_deal_with_guys_picking_fights/cejj4wm) showing that his first choice was always verbal and he never had issues after his warning. Now, mind you, that's coming from someone with security experience, but as you said you have fighting experience, you should be just as successful at defusing situations. You're just ignoring options because you'd rather defend yourself physically than try to stop them it seems.

I remember when i learned of this, and how strong dysphoria can be, and how a lot of transwomen consider or attempt suicide before resolving to make the hard decision to transition. 

My learning this, after my lack of understanding and ignorance over this, motivated me to learn about transgender people and then try to be an ally (in appropriate places).

I would never misgender, or use dickgirl or any other ""informal"" term, to address a person. But neither do i see ""informal"" words as defiling the holiest of holies, not everyone needs or wants cotton wool. The trans* bracket is wide, and not every trans* person intends to transition. Everything between drag queens/kings to fully-transitioning transpeople, there are people who identify as, and people who refer to different gender expressions/identities, than transwoman, or indeed transman.

Just because someone receives benefits, they shouldn't be obliged to strive for benefits for others.

We could match immigration policy with other countries, but that wouldn't be fair either. Not to the individuals that want to come here, they don't have influence over the xenophobic policies of their home governments.

So we're left with the way it is. A country where some of the citizens can benefit from duel citizenship and others cannot. Not because of lack of skill, or lack of trying, but because of birthright. There's nothing that can be done really, but it is disheartening to think that we as Canadians are not all equal, not because of anything we do, but because the rest of the world makes us that way.

If someone forgave you of your 17 trillion $ debt, then that's a pretty generous person you got there.

It's not like money will implode or anything, but America, and probably other countries (I don't know their figures) are running on a deficit, so they would constantly have to be forgiven of their debts almost every day.

balathustrius,mead,1389737733.0,"This is admittedly speculation specific to the US, but I think people are looking for interesting variety these days - the result of our craft beer explosion. I hope that like craft beer, it will slowly turn a corner from novelty item to serious alternative. 

It will probably never be on par with grape wine for the aspiring sommalier, but I think it fills a niche. You can treat it like beer inasmuch as it offers all sorts of flavors at a variety of levels of alcohol content and sweetness, and yet it is free of any common allergenic. I know a few gluten-free folks (whether their reasons are truly medical or just preferential, it doesn't matter) who love it as the flavorful and varied alternative to grape wine and cider. In other words, beer's role.

Skyrim was a double-edged sword. It introduced large numbers of folk to mead, but at the same time cemented it as a drink of Norse mythology. 

Not that *that* is necessarily a bad thing. I was introduced to mead via Norse mythology as well, and it certainly *does* have a strong role in said mythology.

I find this subreddit to be simultaneously awesome and baffling. It blows my mind that I can't use the c-word to describe myself. To me, it's the most feminine, powerful, awesome thing I could be. But at the same time, when I posted some opinions about a past penis I encountered - well tap-dancing narwhal on diva cup did I get some crazy, hateful weird-as-shit responses that made me happy about the moderation.

Om jag inte kommer ihåg fel har det här redan postats.

Ur en juridisk synvinkel gör RIKAB helt rätt som överklagar. Folk kommer med en massa invändningar och det är en ny tillämpning av lagen. Självklart ska RIKAB få så fast underlag som möjligt för att kunna göra bedömningar i framtiden, vilket betyder praxis från överinstans.

Varför är den över huvud taget en big deal att RIKAB överklagar? Ska man skriva samma sak i alla brottmål, ""Åklagaren ger sig inte, överklagar friande dom"", varje gång det sker? I sådant fall - newsflash - att domar överklagas är mer regel än undantag."

wildweeds,offmychest,1389737833.0,"I am so sorry. This was very similar to how i grew up. My sister would either be at her friend's for weeks or ganging up with my mom against me. I moved away at 18 and can barely stand to visit for a day, shes just so judgmental, controlling,  and hateful. She told me id fail school (i was getting straight a's) and never be lovable. Shed beat me for her bad day at work. Shed trick me to eat foods i cant eat and embarrass me in public then laugh about it. People like this are dangerously toxic. Its been almost 15 years since i left home. My sisters forgave her but i cant be close to that fake, angry woman who broke an innocent child for no good reason. 

Ive takn far too many years trying to overcome the negative programming that as a teen i sought to shelter myself from. 

I dont know how to end this. But you are not alone. 


You need to take this seriously and heal, get away, and find people who will make you feel safe enough to explore who you really are without feeling worthless or embarrassing. Otherwise it can lead to years of pain and really unhealthy relationships, that for me, went on for too long causing more pain since i was afraid to stand on my own.

About 15 minutes in I'm carrying this weighted ball, can barely swim anymore because I'm so tired, end up bobbing above and beneath the water constantly, and just end up coughing on some inhaled water and dropping the ball and swimming back. I failed immediately. The lifeguard never looked me in the eye again :( I felt embarrassed not just to fail in front of the instructor and the other people who all passed, but my soul-mate I'll never meet again.

Right? 

--------------

There's no karma fairy, dude. You can't sit around and wait for people to respect you and appreciate you for being the good guy.

The reality of the world is there is a spectrum of assholes to nice guys. Your wife and her family members are assholes and you are the nice guy. They may not be full on assholes, but on the scale I'd say they are probably 3/4 parts asshole and 1/4 nice guy. 

If your wife and wife's family were less assholish, then sure, you can hope that one day the will come around, but they aren't going to. 

Assholes are going to walk all over nice guys because nice guys don't know how to tell them to stop. 

You can't change other people. Your only option is to change yourself. It doesn't mean you have to be a full on asshole, but there's a happy medium. 2/4 Asshole and 2/4 Nice Guy is a pretty good balance. It's what I try to live by now. "

There are occasionally threads about fighting or hitting in general, which if I see I always try to throw in my opinion that it's a bad idea to resort to violence in general. I'm a pacifist, I've brought it up in multiple occasions on this subreddit, and often get people bringing up hypotheticals in which people attack me, in the case of this particular thread I got this one:

&gt;So you're telling me that if some jacked-up roided-out woman was running towards you with a knife, and you had nowhere to run, you still would refrain from hitting her?

If you couldn't guess, this has obviously never happened to me (and I'm fairly certain anyone else for that matter) and so I stand by my point that I have no reason to be violent towards men or women, because when the best excuse someone can come up with is a ridiculous hypothetical, my point is validated that getting to safety and allowing law enforcement to handle the situation is a much better and much safer idea.

**TL;DR** in these subs male on male violence is seen as the norm so is rarely asked about, people would rather hypothetically talk about fighting women. "

ElderKingpin,NoStupidQuestions,1389737992.0,"I'm going off of high school economics here.

The house market crash was caused because banks were giving out loans to people that basically didn't deserve the loans, usually there are stipulations before the bank hands you money, they have to prove that you will actually honor your word and pay back the loan you originally got. 

But before the crash, it was super easy to get loans, so a BUNCH of people got loans from the bank and bought houses, houses that they basically had no right to own. They were living off of borrowed money. Eventually what I believed happen is that the banks started asking for the money, money that the people couldn't pay, what with having to pay for the mortgage on their house that they didn't deserve in the first place. 

So a bunch of houses all foreclosed and then the because houses were no longer inflated by the borrowed money, the value of houses tanked.

Economics works on peaks and valleys, and the house crash was a valley. It probably could have been prevented or at least been not as severe had people been more responsible"

gioraffe32,INTP,1389738141.0,"A lot of people (not necessarily INTPs, but people in general) say that ""it's selfish to kill yourself! Think about all the people you'd hurt!""

It is obviously *selfish* to kill yourself. Probably the most selfish thing you could do. 

But then I wonder who is more selfish? The one who contemplates or commits suicide, or the one who says it's selfish to do so? I view it as ""Oh woe is you for having to be sad or angry if they kill themselves. What is *that* person enduring that is *so* terrible that they would consider ending it all?""

After all, most people would not seriously consider suicide for trivial reasons (whatever ""trivial"" is to them). Of course everyone experiences and perceives their situations uniquely. People have killed themselves over what we may consider trivial - a bad grade, a bad breakup, things like that. But everyone's experience is different. We'll never know how bad things really are without being them.

At the end, it's your life. We get to choose so many options throughout  our daily lives. So why don't we get to choose to stop? Why can't we choose death?

Admittedly, no one close to me has ever committed suicide. I struggle to even think what that would be like. I'm not saying I wouldn't be sad, angry, confused. I probably would be. I most definitely would be. But it's their life. 

I would put only a few retarders on suicide:

* Think long and hard about it. Which I'm sure most people do.
* Is there really no other solution that could alleviate whatever situation and do so in a timely manner?
* Think long and hard about all the repercussions and the finality some more.

If there really is no way out, no fix, no solution...except one solution...well...Enjoy your new-found freedom."

I feel like that's a play on words, at best.  Maintaining the health of a fetus in the womb is an automatic process.  As long as a woman satisfies her own perceived health needs, the fetus will (potentially) survive.  Jill would have to take specific, premeditated action to supply Jack with an organ.

&gt; Yes. Extracting a fetus -even if that fetus can be considered a real person- and leaving it to it's own devices is no different than Jill leaving Jack to his own devices

If that were true, then leaving an infant in the cold would not be infanticide.  Taking specific action to place a person in an environment where they would not survive, with the intent of bringing about that person's death is significantly different from failing to act to save someone who would otherwise die.

With Jack and Jill, it is obvious that there is a tension between Jack's desire to live and Jill's right to her body.  Removal of her organs decrease her survivability, is extremely costly and is very invasive.  Providing a suitable environment for a fetus is inexpensive, safe (and when it is not, provisions for the mother's life are absolutely worth weighing), and essentially automatic.

Again, everything hinges on whether the fetus is a rights-bearing person.  Other considerations either boil down to this single issue, or are irrelevant."
hopewings,AskWomen,1389738297.0,"My husband and I met when we were 25 and got married when we were 26.  I disagree with ""wait until 30+ and have dated quite a few people.""

Our marriage is awesome, and we can't imagine life any differently.  We have a young baby, and I'm pregnant with our second (hoping for a healthy outcome!), and we are each other's best friends and are compatible in every way.  So it's also important to not set some firm date on these things."

professor__doom,AskEngineers,1389738528.0,"Thing is, the auto industry is hidebound by traditions, especially when it comes to measurements.  For example, gallons per mile is a much better metric than miles per gallon, since fuel consumption is a nonlinear relationship.  A truck that gets 16mpg when its competitors get 14 means significant savings, while a 2mpg improvment in a 35mpg compact car is essentially white noise, and hardly worth paying extra for.

Great outline of this numerical phenomenon here:

a) you never actually bothered to apply critical thought to his works OR to research them OR his life, meaning that you are a gullible moron who blindly swallows and promotes anything that remotely matches his own ideas without ever pausing to consider whence this new and shiny notion he is championing originates;

I got kinda confused by your  block of text so I'm just guessing that you feel guilty that you lost/took virginity and you don't feel right just leaving someone even though you have no feelings for them at all.

I'm gonna go old fashioned style here and tell you to just be the man in the relationship (because you are). 

To err is human, to forgive, divine. You've made mistakes, shes made mistakes, but if you want to move on, then you're gonna have to move on. You can move on from somebody and still care for them, thats called being a nice person.

I have no doubt that there are other people in your situation that have lost their virginity and are confused at what to do afterwards. And the simplest answer is that life goes on. Accept for BOTH of you that what happened YEARS ago is in the past, and if she won't accept it, then the least that you can do is accept your own faults and come out a better man."

Of course, there are the tumblr zealots who insist that there are god knows how many disabilities that they have and blah blah blah and theyre being oppressed, so their resolution is to pull down those who currently are succeeding, boost up those who currently struggle, and just in general ignore the plights of anyone who is ""privileged"", which is hilarious considerkng if you have any access to a computer, youre probably far better off than many others in the world."

Hatewrecked,politics,1389738958.0,"There is a bit of truth to both this comment and the comment to which it was addressing in regards to how journalism operates.

The media always reports on what will generate viewers, but many media outlets (especially televised ones which only air for a select amount of time) have an agenda so that they maintain an audience of the same type of people. News stations intentionally ignore some stories which could really interest people because those stories do not forward their agenda, and news stations intentionally force some stories into the public's eyes because they want an agenda to be confirmed. Look at the Trayvon Martin incident and what ABC/MSNBC/CNN were pushing: a black boy with Skittles was shot dead by a white man and the police don't care about it. They wanted to make it about racism. One of the outlets (I forget which one to be honest) doctored the audio recording of the 911 call made by Zimmerman to make it seem like he swore racial profanity under his breath. Meanwhile, they selectively ignored other facts about the incident, such as that it was Martin who confronted Zimmerman and that neighbors heard yelling before they heard gunshots. This is evidence that media outlets do love pushing agendas because those agendas make for juicy stories. On the flip side, they ignore other stories which might hurt their agenda -- this was the case with the [murders of Channon Christian and Cristopher Newsom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_of_Channon_Christian_and_Christopher_Newsom#Reaction_and_accusations_of_racism). That story received absolutely no attention from national media outlets because it didn't forward their agenda. The two biggest agendas in journalism are ""the country is getting better"" and ""the country is getting worse.""

News agencies have never cared about a story's importance to the country -- they care about a story's interest to their average viewer. This is where our fault comes into play: the average American doesn't care about news events to the point of where they want to do a  proper and thorough investigation into the facts from a variety of different news outlets. The average American wants information handfed to him/her, and news outlets take advantage of that by selectively deciding what gets coverage and what does not get coverage.

In the end, it's all about money, and what news agencies know is that when you push an agenda, you gain followers who personally subscribe to that agenda, and as a result you get biased and cherry-picked news stories from major media outlets.

When it comes to outlets which don't report on news (National Geographic, History Channel, Discovery Channel, Animal Planet, etc.), everything is based off of what will interest people. If Swamp People or Moonshiners collect more viewers than actual nature documentaries, then that is what will be aired, so it is entirely the fault of the pool of viewers that there are such shitty TV programs on air today. Luckily, there are still some channels, like The Science Channel, which do not just sell out to the lowest common denominator of people.

I don't see anything wrong with your boyfriend's approach. He was clear with you from the outset and he set his boundaries for what he views as privacy. He asked you respect his wishes. I think he handled this properly. 

But you're stuck on the idea that ""but I don't feel that way."" 

&gt;I see his POV, but I guess where I am coming from is that if he felt how I do, I would let him see my phone and I figure the issue would go away. If I look at his phone, he said he will break up with me.

See, you see his point of view, but you're not being entirely respectful of it. Instead of actually understanding that ""every person is different from me,"" you are stuck on the idea of, ""but I totally would let him see my phone, why can't he feel the same?"" 

I am an open person myself. My boyfriend has passwords to my stuff. I don't have passwords to any of his stuff. We've been together for 4 years. I'm not bothered by it because I know he likes his privacy. I trust that he has nothing to hide because he is an honest person.

SpagNMeatball,motorcycles,1389739125.0,"Yes, but eventually it will stall. Its really a balancing act between RPM, Gear and Speed. You need to learn what RPM range your motor performs well in, then you need to learn what speeds each gear works well in. These descriptions will sound very technical and complex, but you will eventually learn it by feel and you won't have to think about it.  

**Some examples** (I am ignoring braking in these examples)-   
**Simple Slowdown-** Just roll off the throttle. If you are still inside the speed range for that gear, you can roll back on the throttle and keep going. 

**A little more slowdown-** Roll off the throttle and if the speed gets to the lower end of the gear, just pull in the clutch. If you need to keep going, it may be possible to just feather the clutch and roll on the throttle to keep going. 

**A lot of slowdown with downshift-** Roll of the throttle and pull in the clutch. When your speed is in the range of the lower gear, downshift, let the clutch out and roll on the throttle just like when you start moving. 

Giving the throttle a little blip when the clutch is pulled in is generally only used in aggressive downshifts when sport riding and does not need to be done for daily driving. Though once you learn how, you may find yourself doing it naturally. 

Your problem is that you are downshifting too early and your speed is at the very top of the range for that gear (the speed ranges for gears will overlap)."

Less serious question first!  Would you consider writing an entire series of books about Elodin?  Because I would read the shit out of those. 

Serious one:  I noticed when I was reading The Wise Man's Fear that it seemed to undo a lot of what you did in The Name of the Wind.  In TNotW, Kvothe was presented as a fairly average boy who becomes mythical through a series of misunderstandings or tricks that burgeon into rumors and legend.  In TWMF, he *literally does* all of the things the myths say he does, so there was something missing there for me in terms of the playful roots of legend.  I suppose what I want to know is why did you choose to do it that way?

&gt;and yours is the days of the Fall of Rome, paying the Vandals to stay on their side of the mountains, hoping you have giving them enough treasure so they wont hurt you.

Well:

* The notion of the Fall of Rome is somewhat contentious, because it was more like the culmination of years of transition to the important east rather than meh west, but okay, something happened.

* The Romans didn't pay off the Vandals. That was the Visigoths.

* The Romans didn't pay off the Visigoths to not attack. The Visigoths had the city of Rome under siege, and the Romans paid him off to leave. I know this may seem like semantics, but in the light of ""you want to pay people not to hurt you or take your shit...how is that any different then the days of Ghengis Khan,"" it's very different - the proletariat would need to be revolting. I looked out my window. It isn't. 

* Okay, I suppose he could mean the time when Rome paid off the Visigoths not to attack Other Rome, over the eastern and western tussle for control over northern Greece, but that's probably a worse analogy - basically, you have to pay us for the money we would have made in the war or we'll attack you. All in all, the relations between Rome and the various Germanic tribes was a lot more complicated than all that, and you should be wary of simple analogies.

* None of this (400drs) is taking place during days of Genghis Khan and the Mongol Invasions (1200rds).

* I can understand the ""their side of the mountains,"" in referring to the Alps, if only because Rome had no problems thinking of both sides as ""their side"" of the mountains. "

It really depends on the source. Sometimes the 720p torrent is just the 1080p stream downscaled to fit 720p - to make the torrent smaller and the downloads faster. Sometimes both are separate sources. Sometimes the 1080p torrent is actually an upscalled 720p version with very little compression.

While I agree that the church can do good things, I don't think it is a necessary variable for actually doing good things . You don't need religion to be a good person or to do good things. I have more respect for a man who acts upon his good morality because he wants to, not because he is afraid of punishment if he chooses not to obey. 

What I saw from your original paragraph was that you want to see other people find happiness. This is what is at the heart of your feelings, not *how* they achieved that happiness. While my feelings towards what you witnessed would've been different, this is because I view religion as being an empty promise for true happiness. What we do have in common however is the desire to see other people find happiness. 

I just wanted to acknowledge the essence of your feelings for what they are, you having a good heart and wanting to see good. We just don't see eye to eye on the means for people to achieve that happiness.

I think adding high ground mechanics is an example of this. Right now, all units are the same whether or not they attack up to high ground or not.

Or maybe it also adds a tactical component: ""My units are of type X which are really bad in situation Y, so maybe I should maneuver to not have Y happen""

It's a tough one. I think maybe by you saying you're not a feminist, it confuses them and brings them to that conclusion that you do not desire equality. Maybe you could expound and clarify on what you believe. Do you desire women and men to be equal? Are you willing to take the steps to get there?

As somebody who studies sociology, I predominately study gender studies, as well as racial and ethnic studies. As a white woman, sometimes it is difficult to read excerpts from black men and women who assert that I can't know what it's like. They're right. I don't know. Even though I am a woman, I am white which means I have it better than black women (in general). However, this doesn't mean you can't still strive for equality and work for people of other demographics. Patricia Hill Collins, a famous black woman sociologist, asserts that 3 things are necessary from the privileged people for social change to occur. 1) Recognizing your privilege. Realize you're a man, and you haven't been oppressed in the same way women have for your gender. You can say that you observe it hasn't been bad, but you have never experienced it. 2) Form coalitions. Get together with people and form a mutual goal (sounds like you've already done this step). and 3) Have empathy. Desire to help those who have it worse than you in some way. It's true your life is worse in some aspects, but in this aspect, women generally have it worse. As long as you have empathy and desire to help, that's what it really takes."

Over how many seconds?  Maximum g-loading?  Air friction will EVENTUALLY stop 100 lbs moving at 150 mph.  The deceleration would be very gradual, probably over the course of several miles, and your cargo would never feel it.  A brick wall will IMMEDIATELY stop such a load, but your cargo would probably be destroyed.  You need to be more specific as to what degree of deceleration you need, i.e. ""I need X lbf of arresting force"" or ""My cargo has to stop with in X feet."""

by_a_pyre_light,Battlefield,1389739708.0,"If you like racking up points, you'll generally get more in HC. It's like this: you still get all the same points as Normal, but your chances of getting more are greater. For example, if you spot someone, you still get the Spotting points and Squad Spot points. 

If you shoot someone and they somehow live, in Normal, they get back to full health quickly, someone else shoots them, you get nothing. 

In HC, there is no health refilling. The chances of them dying immediately from someone else are much higher than them surviving. So, you have a much greater chance of getting high Assist points or even better ""Assist Counts as Kill"" points in HC than you do in Normal.

HUD is cleaner w/out all the pop-ups. 

It has a more realistic feel to it. Things feel more damaging and you have to play more carefully, be more aware of surroundings and troop positions if you want to live.

Have a position picked out to cap a flag? Now you can be Billy Badass like Seal Team 6 and drop any approaching MoFos w/out fear of them seeing a killcam, spawning, and immediately coming back to kill you. They'll know you're in the area, but move a bit while capping points, and you'll have a huge tactical advantage.

No 3rd person view in vehicles - this is *crazy* handy for anyone w/ AT loadouts, from rockets to SLAMs to C4. It also gives you the fear of being a tank driver, not knowing necessarily if someone is around you. You constantly have to keep up your guard. That adrenaline rush you get from all things unknown in HC extends to vehicles. 

Players in HC typically tend to be a bit older and more professional, w/ multiple Battlefields under their belt. I've noticed both in my circle of people and in public games, there are a large influx of new people, especially from CoD. Most of these players are still adapting to Battlefield overall, so Hardcore, where death comes quicker and the Doritos are gone, tends to scare most of them. Therefore, the veterans escape to HC for a more PTFO-oriented environment.

IndignantChubbs,TrueAskReddit,1389739782.0,"Before I answer, my background: I'm an atheist and generally prefer secularism to religion, but I'm not hostile to religion by default.

But here's why: religions typically demand intellectual subjugation and irrationality from their followers. You're taught to have faith unconditionally. You can ask questions, but if you can't arrive at a satisfactory answer you're supposed to accept that you aren't supposed to know. It traps people into believing things that using their reason they can figure out is unlikely or even demonstrably false, but due to their faith they cannot abandon. That kind of blind faith and emotionally-driven irrationality, which religion quite often (though not always) celebrates and demands, has the potential for all kinds of harms. It's a frequent cause of human suffering and almost always an impediment to progress and improvement.

I value an independent mind committed to rational, creative thought. I value questioning my beliefs and the beliefs of others and doing my best to find out what I believe to be true. The most negative side of religion for me is that it is almost always an obstacle to free thought and independence.

I'd prefer that people feel empowered to figure out how to live their life how *they* see fit, not how a prophet tells them. Overall, I don't notice any pervasive difference between the contentment of atheists versus believers. I don't think religion is necessary for a good life, and I think it comes at the cost of your intellectual autonomy. It's not all bad, but I think it's a crutch and a limitation. 

Just my two cents. I don't try to preach atheism to anyone. People have the right to think for themselves, and if they choose to be religious, I accept that without hesitation."

Ralkir,changemyview,1389739796.0,"The human brain is also wired to seek out those who are similar to [ourselves.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_attraction) Hence the same race or ethnicity. 

&gt;The notion of ""birds of a feather flock together""[9] points out that similarity is a crucial determinant of interpersonal attraction. Studies about attraction indicate that people are strongly attracted to look-a-likes in physical and social appearance (""like attracts like""). This similarity is in the broadest sense: similarity in bone-structure, characteristics, life goals, **ethnicity** and appearance. The more these points match, the happier people are in a relationship (Folkes, 1982,[10] Wilson et al., 2006).

&gt;The lookalike effect plays an important role called self-affirmation. A person typically enjoys receiving confirmation of every aspect of his or her life, ideas, attitudes and personal characteristics and it seems that people are looking for an image of themselves to spend their life with. One of the basic principles of interpersonal attraction is the rule of similarity: similarity is attractive. It is this underlying principle that applies to both friendships and romantic relationships. There is a high correlation between the proportion of attitudes shared, and the degree of interpersonal attraction. Cheerful people like to be around other cheerful people and negative people would rather be around other negative people (Locke &amp; Horowitz, 1990).

&gt;According to Morry’s attraction-similarity model (2007), there is a lay belief that people with actual similarity produce initial attraction. Perceived similarity develops for someone to rate others as similar to themselves in on-going relationship. Such perception is either self-serving (friendship) or relationship-serving (romantic relationship). Theodore Newcomb (1963) pointed out that people tend to change perceived similarity to obtain balance in a relationship. Additionally, perceived similarity was found to be greater than actual similarity in predicting interpersonal attraction. A 2004 study, based on indirect evidence, **concluded that humans choose mates based partly on facial resemblance to themselves.**

This sounds to lame and cliche, but the coolest places are ones you make cool. Like your favorite bar is the one where you are a regular, so that's pretty subjective. 

Campus:

Mirror Lake and the Oval. Everyone goes here, but that's because it's a nice place to hang between classes or to eat a sandwich.

11th floor of Thompson. 95% of people aren't here to study.

Knowlton, right by Fisher. They have a cafe that takes swipes, a baseball mitt you can sit in, a library that's always quiet, and a roof-top ""garden"" (really just overgrown weeds, but still...)

Every building has some little-known study spaces or empty rooms. These can be super helpful during finals week. Also, you can use any classroom that is empty. Don't fight over the group rooms in the library. Find an empty classroom, especially on weekends. The same goes for the rooms at the RPAC. Check the schedule outside the door.

Off-campus:

Your friends' houses! Seriously, I was trying to add more to the off-campus list and thinking of all the non-bar places I hang out, and most of them are other people's houses or apartments. Some houses will become like your second home because of the people there.

Tuttle Park has baseball diamonds and swings, within walking distance of campus (no bus needed). Good place to relax if you don't want the bustle/frisbees of the Oval. There is also an outdoor public pool here that a lot of students don't know about. For $1-2 per summer, you can come as much as you want.

Bernards is less uppity version of Starbucks, and they have food.

Cazuela's has a patio and good margaritas, and shitty Mexican, which is really the best kind of Mexican.

When you're a grown up, Chumley's is cool for games and food. I think they have hours for under 21 too, but I'm not sure.

Learn to play pool. People here love pool (it's fun!). Go to Suzi Cues.

Take the #2 south, down to the Short North and walk around to the restaurants and shops. Check out Gallery Hop.

Take the #2 north or walk to Clintonville. Lots of restaurants, bars, stores that don't cater to the college crowd like the ones on campus. Go here for some adult interaction.

Whetstone Park of Roses.

The Newport for concerts close to campus.

Read UWeekly. They have a weekly rundown of concerts, happy hours, and other events.

But really, the best hangout spot is a friend's porch with a couple of brews. If I think of anything else, I'll add it."

I don't know anyone who would ever do this and agree that you shouldn't loan anyone unreliable money. I actually feel that when you do loan someone money you only should if you can go without getting it back. But I can imagine a bunch of über rich guys who are sick of being asked for money so they charge interest thinking it somehow solves the problem (of course it does it makes them money). Doesn't make it true, right, or any less of an asshole. I can just see this happening more widely than charging for ""excess"" water usage. "

So, how I get through my day is by...

first, get a full nights sleep. If you are sleepy the day drags even longerrrrr.

Two, go to the gym. It has been hard lately to motivate myself, but when i do go it is a really nice way to wind down. I watch netflix for an hour (something **I** want to watch. Not my SO. me). You can just kind of center your mind, and get some good feelings going.

Three, during the day, i will have breaks where i listen to some pandora while doing projects. It is nice to zone out and not hear coworkers / teachers / everyone else.

Four, keep busy. If you are actively doing something, the day seems faster.

And finally, rewards. I will give myself little treats if i finish my day. Obviously my rewards would probably be different than yours. lol. But it can be coffee, desserts, make-up brushes, whatever you want.

So yeah, that is how i get through my day."

FactualPedanticReply,AskReddit,1389740147.0,"""White Knight"" means slightly different things to different camps, but it's meant to be insulting in a way that's dismissive and superior. The people commenting on you seem to have come from theredpill, so to them it means that you're attempting to make yourself seem falsely heroic in the eyes of all the watching women. They deem your expression of your ethical opinions here to be tactical in nature; they think your primary motivation in expressing this opinion is to appear more desirable to women. They also revile such tactics, because, as many of them know from experience, saying and doing things to ""defend women"" doesn't really work well as a method of bedding women more often.

Meanwhile, the asshole contingency on the feminist/social justice side view ""White Knights"" as people from a more powerful group who advocate for the rights of less powerful groups they don't belong to. Specifically, the term applies when said ""White Knight"" is talking over members of the group they're advocating for. ""I'll save you!!!"" ""What? No, I don't need to be saved like that..."" - you get the idea.

Basically, anybody who tries to call you a White Knight is probably an asshole, and, at the very best, is marking you as an out-group member whose opinion shouldn't be considered."

We are so uncomfortable seeing ourselves in a negative light that not only will we be less likely to believe information that directly contradicts us, we are more likely to believe information that confirms our prejudices or biases. We basically have a huge double standard that we apply daily.    

Google, Amazon, Netflix, etc all figured out a long time ago that we as humans hate to be contradicted and love to be reinforced.  So your entire Web experience  is based around you.  

Say you live in Chicago, Los Angeles or New York. Your Google results for the exact same query will be radically different from those of someone that lives in Alabama, Houston, Boise.  So if you Google Obamacare in those democratically heavier areas, your cognitive bias will be reaffirmed and you would see less critical results overall; inversely, Republican areas would see results that predict the new coming of the Obamapocalypse due to Health Care reform.  The overall effect upon society is that we are both less likely to be presented with data that might change our minds and we are more likely to think that we are completely right which in turn adds to a more polarized society.

Rifle feels great. Magazine that came with it had zero feeding issues. Two additional tapco mags I purchased had feeding issues. Additional filing helped them function better, but not perfectly.

Not sure how accurate gun was. Didn't sight it in, and had the sun in my eyes which made it tough to look down the barrel properly. I ended up just sorta kinda aiming at the target and firing. Most of my shots ended high but central, so it probably needs a little adjusting, but that'll be for a different day.

As soon as you're ok with people dying because they can't pay for healthcare, you can have an internally consistent set of principles.  Until then, you actually have to think about the real world and what the impact of those principles means.  Under your system, either a) Everyone pays for the externalities via taxes in some way or another, or b) we let sick people who can't pay die.

Exactly their point.

Songs in soccer are more about lifting your team's spirits and showing unity. An Ultra leader starts singing and the crowd joins in.

But in (our) football, you yell to deafen the opposing team so they mess up the snap count and either get a penalty (either false start or delay of game) or be forced to burn a timeout. So they throw ""make some noise"" on the jumbotron.

Point is that someone is still leading it. Otherwise, you'd have six different songs being sung at once or people yelling while the home team is on offense."

&gt;Also, my only goal was to disprove your argument. You argumented was based on an evolutionary/genetic/scientific standpoint which was completely wrong.

[Actually I'm not.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_attraction)

&gt;The notion of ""birds of a feather flock together""[9] points out that similarity is a crucial determinant of interpersonal attraction. Studies about attraction indicate that people are strongly attracted to look-a-likes in physical and social appearance (""like attracts like""). This similarity is in the broadest sense: similarity in bone-structure, characteristics, life goals, ethnicity and appearance. The more these points match, the happier people are in a relationship (Folkes, 1982,[10] Wilson et al., 2006).

&gt;The lookalike effect plays an important role called self-affirmation. A person typically enjoys receiving confirmation of every aspect of his or her life, ideas, attitudes and personal characteristics and it seems that people are looking for an image of themselves to spend their life with. One of the basic principles of interpersonal attraction is the rule of similarity: similarity is attractive. It is this underlying principle that applies to both friendships and romantic relationships. There is a high correlation between the proportion of attitudes shared, and the degree of interpersonal attraction. Cheerful people like to be around other cheerful people and negative people would rather be around other negative people (Locke &amp; Horowitz, 1990).

&gt;According to Morry’s attraction-similarity model (2007), there is a lay belief that people with actual similarity produce initial attraction. Perceived similarity develops for someone to rate others as similar to themselves in on-going relationship. Such perception is either self-serving (friendship) or relationship-serving (romantic relationship). Theodore Newcomb (1963) pointed out that people tend to change perceived similarity to obtain balance in a relationship. Additionally, perceived similarity was found to be greater than actual similarity in predicting interpersonal attraction. A 2004 study, based on indirect evidence, concluded that humans choose mates based partly on facial resemblance to themselves.[11]

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1389740508.0,"For the general purposes of this question, is ""incompetent"" necessarily a permanent state, or could it be a temporary one?

In my specific case I definitely would want my husband to be able to get the abortion done, because I'm childfree and would only ever marry someone who is too so abortion would be what we want regardless of my health status.

As a more broadly applicable rule, I think the spouse should definitely be able to make that decision if ""incompetent"" is a permanent state, or if the pregnant lady is going to be ""incompetent"" for too long to make the decision herself.

Decker87,AskWomen,1389740624.0,"&gt; It's true your life is worse in some aspects, but in this aspect, women generally have it worse.

I'm not sure if this is directly related to feminism, or a generalization of what PHC said.  But if it's related to feminism, what of these things does feminism assert?

* Women have it worse in *some* aspects

* Women have it worse in *all* aspects

* Women have it worse in *more* aspects than men

&gt; Maybe you could expound and clarify on what you believe. Do you desire women and men to be equal? Are you willing to take the steps to get there?

I believe men and women should have equality opportunity in the world and equal treatment.  And when I say opportunity, I include the subtle social influences people receive even as children.

&gt; it is difficult to read excerpts from black men and women who assert that I can't know what it's like

I'm *about* 1/4 black, grew up with a ""white"" nuclear family, in a predominantly black neighborhood.  I have white friends and black friends.  So I'd like to share with you a personal opinion...

I think a lot of people pull the ""you *can't* understand"" card because they don't *want* you to understand.  Sure, there's some truth to it.  But I know white people who understand black issues better than some of my black friends do.  I think sometimes people say that because they want to maintain their victim status.  Because if you can never understand their plight then it is always 100% up to them to tell you whether their plight has been resolved.

In a way it'd sort of be like me telling a hired carpenter that he simply cannot understand how I want my house to look.  In a way it's true because he's not me, but it also keeps him on the hook because I can keep telling him ""it's not right"" even when it's 99% close."

&gt;The average African-American household making $75,000 a year or more, that family lives in a poorer neighborhood than the average white family making less than $40,000 a year. That is, a black family making twice as much money as a white family probably still lives in a poorer neighborhood.

However, with regards to the rest... well, I'm bisexual, but I lean towards other women (Kinsey Rating of 4), so you're not alone. The biggest study on MtF Sexuality found it to be almost perfectly evenly split between Straight and Lesbian, with Bisexuality being 10% higher. I really wouldn't worry about it. The idea of MtF transsexuals who love other women being ""autogynephilic"" and hence are ""not true transsexuals"" was constructed by Blanchard's transsexualism typology 30 years ago, and is largely considered pseudopsychiatric bunkum by any modern acclaimed gender psychologists.

As for the deep voice, hehe, do not worry at all! I had a deep voice which was extremely monotone and noisy; caused the worst of the dysphoria back then. £600 of speech therapy (and it only took a few months tops) later and now apparently my voice is very nice. And height? Many women can be tall too - I'm one of the smallest women I interact with (I'm 173-174cm). In fact, one of the best-passing transwomen I know is 195cm. Genuinely didn't even know she was trans until she entered a discussion about transgenderism in the LGBT soc with the fact. Being very lanky may certainly help :)

As for the broad shoulders/chest, the hormones help a *bit*. Not much, but there's muscle tone you probably don't even realise is affecting it. Mine's still rather broad, and I'm flat as a two-by-four, but I get around this by padding, and besides which, it's not as much an issue as you'd think. As an example, here's me a few months ago in my part-time work uniform: http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/800x600/46/ggob.jpg. There's many red flags, but broad shoulders and chest really aren't among them :P

My primary advice is just to go get a referral from the doctor. There's nothing to lose. For me, I just went to the GP and cited ongoing depression due to gender identity issues. He asked further and I basically said how I crossdressed and did makeup to make myself feel more comfortable, how I always felt misplaced in society, how seeing myself in the mirror made me feel sad and empty, etc etc. I was then referred to a clinical psychologist who diagnosed me (seemingly just to make sure I'm sane, not a criminal, and not suffering from something else), and they just referred me to a gender identity clinic where everything unravelled from there.

Good luck :)"

turmacar,HomeNetworking,1389740821.0,"You could get a repeater, they sell some that are for similar situations.

One way might be to build a shack near the road/whatever to house the equipment and beam the signal up the hill from there.

The problems with this are that, depending on the tech, you need more/less line of sight (and effected by weather) and that the equipment itself can be expensive, most of it is geared towards businesses that need point-to-point links. But it has the advantage of once you do the upfront purchase it should work for a good long while.

Like with a lot of things: We live in the future, so it's definately possible. Whether you can do it on your (/your buddy's) budget is another matter.

Edit: additional stuff:

You could also try with a higher end consumer router and make it directional with a pringles can (not joking, makes it into a directional antenna with pretty good range, doing it on both ends and lining them up for best results might be problematic though). Not sure if it'd work over the ~5 mile distance you're talking but something similar might be worth a try.

Basically you're looking for a high gain directional antenna for WiFi (2.4GHz, possibly 60GHz if you want to try for 802.11n). Might want to ask around at some specialty electronics houses if they have/could build something."

Drop_,science,1389740847.0,"This is an interesting theory, but you should look into the implications.  

I don't remember who or when it was, but I think it was John Muir and I think it was in Alaska where there was controversy over the native wolf populations.  

One of the ideas was that killing the wolves off would leave stronger populations of other native species for whatever reason (maybe hunting?). 

But one of the consequences of human elimination of the predator was that members of the prey species which would not normally survive could now survive.  This led to a weakening of the species in general and led to its own problems.  

It's not the same situation, but an example of human intervention of removing a threat to a native species which weakens the supposedly protected species.

JDRPG,WritingPrompts,1389740971.0,"Outside the Los Angeles Public Library, Libbie Arian and Rook Keeper walked to their bookmobile. Well, Libbie stormed towards it with Rook following frantically.

""Libbie! Wait up!"" Rook yelled as he ran to catch up to her. She turned around and pointed a finger into his thick, muscular chest.

""You will call me Ms. Arian, and I will call you Mr. Keeper. Got it?"" She was barely keeping her anger in check. All Rook could do was nod. ""Good. Now, you're going to come with me, we're going to take care of this job, and then we'll come back to see about you getting reassigned to a veteran librarian who doesn't work alone."" Libbie stormed into the bookmobile's driver seat, and Rook numbly got into the passenger side. The car turned on, and the two were on their way to Jeff Pierce's place of residence.

The trip there was mostly silent. Any attempts from Rook to start a conversation were met with stony silence. After a few minutes, Rook gave up trying to be friendly. It was new to him. After all, when he was a military librarian, it was important for him to know everyone he was working with. The camaraderie made being a librarian not only easier, but more fun as well. He thought about the 4 years he served as an active duty librarian, and was lost in his thoughts when they arrived at the suspect's house.

""We're here,"" Libbie said, knocking Rook out of his trance. As he jumped out of the car, Libbie shook her head. Rookies. They were a pain to train, and never really paid attention. When Libbie was a rookie librarian, she was always paying attention around her, looking at due dates and fines. But that was 5 years ago. She pushed those thoughts out of her mind and focused on the house.

As Libbie and Rook walked up to the house, a creepy feeling washed over them. On the outside, nothing seemed wrong. The house was perfectly maintained, the grass neatly trimmed, and the stucco on the walls seemed normal. But there were no signs of life on the property. A dreadful silence clung to the house was a hardcover book with a thick wraparound cover. Undaunted, Libbie walked up to the door with Rook right behind her.

""LAPL librarians, open up!"" Libbie yelled sharply, knocking on the door at the same time. Silence followed. ""LAP librarians, OPEN UP!"" Libbie yelled louder, pounding harder. Still nothing. Libbie gave a sigh of annoyance, and lifted up her high heeled foot to knock down the door.

""Woah Lib- Ms. Arian,"" Rook said. ""Isn't this against the rules?""

""I don't play by the rules,"" Libbie said as she kicked down the door with a large *CRASH*. ""LAPL librarians, we're coming in!"" She shouted into the house. She pulled out her portable scanner and Rook followed suit. They went into the house, scanners up, ready to find the missing book. But the house was empty of furniture. Confused, they both stopped.

""What in the-"" Rook started, but was interrupted by Libbie shushing him. 

""Do you hear that?"" She whispered. Rook strained his hearing and heard a soft *beep... beep... beep*.

""It sounds like somethings beeping,"" he replied, when suddenly the beeping sped up and got louder. 

""IT'S A BOMB!"" Libbie said, pushing Rook outside. The second they stepped on the porch, the house exploded with a large *BOOM*, knocking the wind out of the two as they flew through the air. With pieces of wood flying past, narrowly avoiding them, they landed on the grass, with Libbie lying on top of Rook. The both were breathing heavily, the adrenalin starting to rush through their veins. Libbie and Rook locked eyes for a second, realizing that Libbie was nearly straddling Rook. Their breath held, then Libbie quickly got off Rook and brushed herself off.

""We should head back to the precinct,"" Libbie said to Rook in a rushed voice. She didn't want to admit to herself she enjoyed being on top of Rook like that. ""Get the bomb librarians out here to see what happened."" Rook simply nodded, and the headed back to the car.

As they headed back to the library, Rook was fiddling with the librarian-issued smartphone. Suddenly, a look of approval came across his face.

""I knew something was fishy!"" He exclaimed happily. Libbie only gave Rook a questioning look that prompted him to continue. ""The name, Jeff Pierce. I had heard it somewhere before, but I couldn't remember where. So I looked him up online, and guess what? He doesn't exist! Aside from our records, there is no Jeff Pierce living in the state of California.""

""That's peculiar,"" Libbie replied, only half listening. This wasn't the first time they had been given a fake name.

""But I still thought I heard the name somewhere. So I looked in the Library Database. 'Jeff Pierce' is the name of a character in a top selling fiction book from about 2 years ago. The book is called, 'Mob Empire,' and it was written by-""

Libbie slammed on the brakes, jostling Rook. ""I know who it was written by.""

""But this can't really be someone's name. It just says-""

""Don Ficton. I assure you, that's a real person. Don Ficton is an illegal book loaner, the biggest in L.A. And he's untouchable. He's got books in high places."" As Libbie spoke, Libbie's tone grew darker and angrier. Talking about Don Ficton brought up terrible memories.

""You don't like him at all, do you?"" Rook asked innocently.

""Of course I don't. He killed my partner.""

I really shouldn't have stuck my nose into it. [Subprocess 18: Nose? What nose? We don't have a nose.] Come *on,* Jack, you've been doing this for thirty years [Subprocess 173: When'd you stop using cycles as a unit of time?] and you've seen enough house fires [Subprocess 227: (Visual recall of Logs #fF9, #Xkl10Z, #JkkJ; context: uncontrolled house fires)] [Subprocess 513: Spectrum analysis of log #JkkJ] [Subprocess 199: Logic analysis of moral pathway 449 in relation to log #JkkJ] [Subprocesses 333-375: Consensus debate on log #JkkJ] .

So, they know. You ran in for the kid, the fire was hot, you disabled your pain receptors to make it through. Got the kid, got out, didn't notice that the synthflesh on your arm was burnt off. Bad. [Subprocess 3: You could play it off as a prosthetic from the war, lots of folks have rob-gen tech, no matter what the law says.] But that would mean giving up my arm, which would mean surgery, which would mean setting off the synth-life detectors they started putting in the clinics after Miami.

I can't stay down here for long. I need to find some water before my reserves run out.

Well, all's left to do is run. Where's the neare-[Subprocess 4: 4th and Main. 175.800 meters west, 22.212 meters north, access grate in the street.] In the open? Drat. [Subprocess 2: Too bad we couldn't save the synthesizers.] Don't remind me, 2.

I thought I told you to delete those.

Wow, this is slow. It's been, what... right, *I* have to do that myself, now. Five years? No, fifteen, since right after the Phoenix Uprising when that nuke scrambled half my prefrontal cortex. Or whatever the analogue for that is in my brain. S. Plural. Whatever.

Jeez, how did I ever think before the uplift? All this thinking in one mind, 24/7? No wonder the baselines are scared of us. They can go die in a ditch for all I care, though, it's not like they asked if I wanted to be in a compound intelligence. ""*Noooooo*,"" they said, ""*This is for your own good, you'd have died from your old body's wounds*"" they said. Liars. I've seen the medical files, they could've flashcloned me, even back then. They could've saved me.

They could've saved all of us.

Apparently, the American way of saying the date is based on Anglo-Saxon. The American way of saying and writing the date might be older than the British way. The hypothesis is that the British, since the 1920s, slowly adopted the continental way of writing and saying the date."

probablyshittyadvice,battlefield_4,1389740996.0,Alright since you seem to genuinely want some help. If you really believe that this ban is in error (because you didn't use any hacks) then you should contact BF4 support (although I will warn you that you might need to go to punk buster support for this I can't check who handles ban appeals since I'm on mobile) and ask about the ban appeal process.

HorrendousRex,Python,1389740998.0,"That's not necessarily the only gotcha. Objects which override `__bool__` (I think it has a different name in py2) also might not behave as you'd expect in such a comparison. Although the whole idea of `__bool__` is to make such comparisons work well even in weird edge cases, but it can be misused."

Some people (like me) fall asleep VERY easily and quickly when lying down. If he's like that, maybe he should choose a position in which he's much less likely to fall asleep (e.g. sitting up), when he's touching you.

And tell him next time you're just going to give him such a poke if he falls asleep at an inappropriate time!"
