Life-in-Death,todayilearned,1390153240.0,"Wait...nasal infection?

So I just googled this and didn't find any info about not using when sick.  In fact I found the opposite:

&gt;""I find it to be the first line of defense in dealing with complicated sinus problems and allergy problems,"" says Evangeline Lausier, MD, assistant clinical professor of medicine and director of clinical services at Duke University's department of integrative medicine. **""Particularly if you are developing congestion or have a sinus infection, it's very helpful.""**

&gt;Is the Neti Pot Safe?

&gt;Research has found that the Neti pot is generally safe. About 10% of regular users experience mild side effects, such as nasal irritation and stinging. Nosebleeds can also occur, but they are rare. Reducing the amount of salt in the solution, adjusting the frequency of Neti pot use, and changing the temperature of the water appear to reduce side effects.

&gt;To prevent infection, always use distilled, sterile, or previously boiled water. Also, it's important to properly care for your nasal irrigation device. Either wash the device thoroughly by hand, or put it in the dishwasher if it's dishwasher-safe. Follow by drying the device completely after each use.

The only warnings I found was not to use tap water.

Saving the bank wouldn't necessarily show up on your account balance, a bonus definitely would.

&gt;It was actually specifically made to not do that. Not sure where you got that. 

When ever I've done research and considered Bud Candy, the consensus was that its flavor masks the plants natural flavors; though it tastes damn good.

&gt;&gt;Flavorful is ridiculously expensive

&gt;Really? I paid like $17 for that bottle and it lasts me for several cycles. That's nothing.

Fair enough, I was looking at prices online, possibly different quantities.

&gt;&gt;You shouldn't have to be ""flushing"" at the end of your nutrient cycle.

&gt;That is your opinion and it not really based on anything other than that.

It's more than just *my* opinion. But if we are talking one-on-one it may as well be.

&gt;You can say that but you don't see and consume what I make. So really you can't make a solid judgement.

No, I haven't, but I'd be very happy to trade medicine if it were possible. Regardless, you ARE happy; and that's what matters at the end of the day.

&gt;Try out what I use if you doubt it, /u/2moreweeks did. I'm not going to knock what you use because I've never used any of it other than the silica blast.

If you cut off your base nutrients and try mine, I surely will carry through and try yours, (though not buying every single product on the schedule.) I have to get my indoor running again; and spend more time caring for the plants. *I have a bad habit of ignoring my indoor when I have outdoor going because I love it so much more.* 

Generally my indoor is for keeping strains over winter and experimenting with different varieties/nutrients rather than producing the best I can. I've done one serious grow since I got my 600w, and since then used it to flower out small clones so I can check for flavor and growth patterns, experiment with a few additives, and try hydroponics first hand. I'd also toss excess clones underneath them, let them flower out and give them away at the end."

Wolvee,writing,1390153453.0,"u/JacoIII is right: Absolutely check out Terry Pratchett for fantasy-comedy. I just recently started reading the Discworld novels and they're hilarious. I started with Equal Rites and I found it quite amusing.

But be careful about your tone. Consistency of tone is pretty important, I think. So if you're going to inject some humor into your heavy-stuff fantasy writing, you'll need to establish the space for it early on. I'd imagine that it will be more natural for the humor to come from your characters since people use humor as a coping mechanism, and just because it's a good ol' time. But if it's a heavy-toned piece, it may feel jarring for your reader if the narrator suddenly drops a zinger.

Alternatively: Check out pretty much anything Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote, he is the master (imo) of establishing an affecting tone for a story while leaving plenty of space for his particular brand of hilarious."

No, there is no clutch pedal in automatic cars. Though there sometimes is a foot rest in the clutch's location. The gear shift level is usually in the same place except in larger vehicles like vans or trucks where the lever is simply part of the steering column (though it works the same way, it's just engineered slightly differently).

Automatic cars still have gears, just not as you think of them, they are usually in a single vertical line pattern. Automatics generally have six gears: Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, 2, 1. 

 * **Park** is the primary wheel locking mechanism. It's basically the car's parking brake. Automatic cars *also* have an ""emergency brake"" for additional locking help. An automatic ""emergency brake"" is essentially just a manual's parking brake.
 * **Reverse** is just reverse.
 * **Neutral** is generally unused unless the car needs to be pushed or towed. 
 * **Drive** is the forward gear and it automatically controls the shifting among the numbered gears you normally do by hand in a manual. The biggest difference is that many automatic car's top gear is replaced by an ""overdrive"" gear.
 * **2 and 1** are just ways to lock in the numbered gears. **1** locks the transmission in first gear while **2** lets the transmission shifts from first to second gear but won't go above second."

Each city usually has their own police force too. That is what I am trying get hired on. They handle the whole city, including traffic, domestic calls, and basically anything that happens in the city.

Also, we have sheriffs. They handle counties, the jails, and a few other things. Counties can have multiple cities in them. In my area there are not many sheriffs or deputies. They mostly handle the jail here, but other parts of the country have a larger sheriffs department and less city police. The sheriffs is an elected positions but they have a lot of deputy sheriffs that are not elected.

keithrc,LifeProTips,1390153697.0,"&gt; My dads best advice was when they initially asked ""how much"", never ever ever give a number or even a range. Instead, say that without any info on benefits, it's too hard to gauge and then ask them the range for the position. If they falter, ask for an average and hit on the benefits issue again.

This is your basic, ""whoever speaks first, loses"" school of negotiation, and is generally pretty solid advice but can bite you in the ass if you appear unprepared or wishy-washy.

They don't consider themselves as vulnerable as they actually might be, nor do they take into account that a lot of women are smaller than men and therefore are more likely to suffer severe physical damage from an attack.

 But the thought process here isn't so much *actually* ""equality means you can't attack other people with impunity"" (like some people argue) as it is ""I have a grudge against women and I'm going to use any argument I can to excuse me taking violent revenge on whatever woman I can as the representative of the evil female collective I imagine is ruling the world."" A common tendency of people who view themselves as powerless in some way (whether the feeling is justified or not) is to fantasize about violently destroying the group they've identified, rightly or wrongly, as the cause of their powerlessness. The tendency to blame women for any and all issues that young men face in today's society seems to be on the rise, unfortunately."

YellowOrbitz,TumblrInAction,1390154015.0,"I honestly don't get the whole fatlogic thing on this. When I go on an airplane I take up half my seat. Do I suddenly get half off because I don't use it all? Nope. I payed for the *whole* seat, and I expect the whole seat. If you're going to take up two seats, whether because you want the extra room or you're too large to fit in one seat, pay for two seats. If you take up three seats you pay for three seats. Even if you don't take up the *whole entire seat* you still pay for it. *Someone* is going to be screwed over in this equation no matter what. Either it's going to be the person who paid for their seat and don't even get to use it, the airline who loses money and will eventually jack up prices (if they give the extra seat away free constantly), or the obese person who is causing the problems. 

It sucks, it really does. However, people shouldn't be punished for other people's choices. Should we make fun of obese people? No. Should they be treated like human beings, of course (I mean no shit, they are). However, if I pay for a goddamn seat I want that whole seat. I'm not paying for half the seat, or the amount my body will fit in if I squish up against the window."

SenseiCAY,dominion,1390154481.0,"Interesting, but I think that the major flaw is that you'll start to get the same cards, eventually. For example, Chapel will almost always get chosen in the first round or two. It's easily the most efficient trasher in the game. Something like Forge (from prosperity) can trash more cards, but it costs $7 and you need a big draw to maximize its functionality.

What about alternate victory cards? Something like Nobles would be very powerful if you had all 8 of them in your deck. Furthermore, if I picked Feodum (1 point per 3 silvers in your deck, gain 3 silvers when you trash it), I would be guaranteed to get one of either Masterpiece (treasure worth $1, costs $3, overpay and gain 1 silver per $1 you overpaid) or Trader (trash a card and gain a silver per $1 that it costs, reveal when you would normally gain a card and gain a silver instead). That's a huge combo and you can make a Feodum worth 8-10 points with it.

Other cards that would provide a huge advantage if only one person could have them, and thus should probably be banned:

* Goons (Costs $6, +1 buy, +$2, each other player discards down to 3 cards in hand, +1 VP per card bought while in play)
* Torturer (+3 cards, each other player must discard two cards or take a curse in hand)
* Lighthouse (Moat has a similar effect, but it's easier to get a couple of Lighthouses and always be able to play a Lighthouse to protect you for your next turn than it is to always draw a Moat in each 5-card hand.
* Bridge (Intrigue, costs $4, +$1, +1 buy, all cards cost $1 less, minimum of $0)
* King's Court (Prosperity, costs $7, play an action from your hand 3 times)
* Mint, especially with platinums in play
* Fool's Gold

ActingPower,mylittlepony,1390154640.0,"Here's the explanation, best as I can do:

* Fourth cousin: If two people are fourth cousins, that means they share the same great-great-great-grandparent.

* Twice removed: Each removal means they are one generation apart. For example, if my great-grandparent is someone else's grandparent (and they're not my parent or uncle/aunt), then we are second cousins once removed. Do you see how that changes it? Great-grandparent is two up to me, but only one up to them. (Also, that means you must have fewer removals than the type of cousin you are. So there's no such thing as a first cousin once or twice removed.)

* ""by a fifth cousin:"" I'm pretty sure this doesn't mean anything.

So if Pinkie Pie is Applejack's fourth cousin twice removed, that means one of two things: either Applejack's great-grandparent is Pinkie Pie's great-great-great-grandparent, or vice-versa. However, since Pinkie Pie and Applejack are approximately the same age, that means one of them has more generations in that period of time than the other. The chart /u/ParaspriteHugger quoted thinks that Pinkie has more.

Does that make sense? I know it can be kind of tricky to pick up. It's [much easier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin) with a [picture](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/European_kinship_system_en.svg). All that's important is that ""fourth cousin twice removed"" is *extremely* distant. Heck, it's so distant it doesn't show up on any of the Wikipedia examples!"

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390154724.0,"I think you might be thinking of giving space for an extended period of time, like days, weeks, etc.

But the context I use 'giving someone space' in, and how I most frequently hear it used, refers to the immediate incident. Like, right after a conflict or confrontation has occurred and one, or both, parties are highly emotional. 

In these cases, it is best to back off and let emotions settle down before continuing communication.

Highly emotional states, like anger/rage, sadness/devastation,  can lead people to do dangerous things, and say horrible, hurtful things they don't mean.

These states can make us defensive, and not able to really hear what another is saying.

People who can remain cool headed and are talented in communication might be able to de-escalate these situations and get effective communication back on track. But those would be rare people.

So typically in CS a good player will either hear or see the flash enter the room and turn away from the flash. You then run in and get owned. Now if you run in and follow the flash, two things can happen. They see you and try to kill you eating the flash in the process, or they double take and try to get the kill before the flash goes off. In both situations, for a split second, they forget about the flash nade that is about to go off. You are expecting it and quickly memorize all the enemy positions in the room and your path through the room. This allows me to run in and get 2-3 kills while spraying. Best part is, when the flash is over, you are standing in an odd position in the room that no one would expect after  flash rush in which they survived.That can set you up for another kill."

MikeCharlieUniform,AskReddit,1390155002.0,"The evidence that I've seen suggests that prison (or even the death penalty) has only a minimal deterrent effect. The deterrence may even be a statistically significant amount, but it is not as if prisons were just eliminated, murder would rise by 1000%. It would rise by a few percent.

Besides, it's not as if in an anarchistic society actions are without consequence. If you do something that others judge to be heinous, you will likely find yourself completely ostracized - and it can be hard to get by in a community if nobody is willing to share their surplus with you.

In reality, *post hoc* punishment doesn't play that large of a role in dictating whether or not someone will commit a crime. There are a lot of other factors which have a much bigger influence."

The fact that it is ""literally the only issue we've had"" just gives more credence to it.  You have had other issues, you just weren't made aware of them.

Anyways, you could attempt to talk to her and deconstruct some of the larger underlying issues, but it is only a 5 month relationship and the idea of breaking up has seriously been floated.  I would just try to move on.

If you do want to try though, understand that she herself might not fully recognize what the issues are or how to verbalize them.  There may be issues she has ignored because she feels stupid/guilty for having them, small things that seem trivial but have built up over time, or insecurities external to the relationship that are being brought in."

Chickeny-goodness,Entrepreneur,1390155108.0,"You really do need to be far more specific, or at least give a good analogy.  Regulatory or technical oopholes are commonplace, and businesses will generally take advantage of them to the extent practical because often enough, if you don't and the competition does, it puts you at a disadvantage.  For example the aforementioned ""doctor finds a loophole and discovers that technically the insurance definition of surgery X does not specifically mention that you sew someone up afterwards"", so he makes that not included in the standard scope and bills extra to sew up the guy afterwards.  And all surgeons doing this scope are aware of it, so the guy that says ""hey, that's stupid, I'm doing for free"" loses out.  Alternatively a contractual loophole may be a dangerous thing to take advantage of - if you find that a contract has accidentally made something ""lump-sum unit cost"" whereas all previous discussions were that the contract was supposed to be ""Time &amp; Materials not to exceed"" and you take advantage of that, you could really hurt your business relationships in the future.  For the most part, it it's a regulatory loophole, I would be inclined to take advantage of it to the extent practical, with the assumption that if the loophole is really that obnoxious, the governing regulatory body will close it.  This, of course, assumes that what you're doing doesn't cause real harm or present a significant ethical dilemma."

wordserious,AskReddit,1390155192.0,"I believe that the point in 1984 is that technology serves an ideology. Cameras and government spying were not new at the time. The important idea, which at least in this form is original to Orwell, is ""he who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past.""

In 1984, the Party uses this as the tool for implementation of its ideology. The mechanics of how this is implemented are invented by Orwell as well, and are described in Winston's job: his job is to overwrite the past so that it will conform to the Party's idea from the present, thereby controlling the future. He accomplishes this by using a machine that recalls printed articles and books from the previous days, weeks, months, altering them, and sending them back to storage, where the altered version was the only remaining version. From then on, anybody trying to figure out how the current war started will only be able to find the Party line, forever. When the Party changes its line for whatever reason, the past is adjusted accordingly.

Today, the idea of retrieving some information, changing it, and archiving it is trivial. Orwell did this before there was an Internet, networking, or even anything that most people today would recognize as a computer.

Incidentally, the fact that legally bought copies of 1984 were silently erased by Amazon from Kindles everywhere at the request of the current copyright owners is ironic, scary, and an immense testament to Orwell's ability to envision a future when technology is abused at the service of someone's idea of what is right."

mountainunicycler,pics,1390155291.0,"Resolution doesn't matter once you get above about six megapixels (if you're targeting basic web. There are a million reasons to want more resolution, but it does not change the visual ""quality"" of the photo when you're looking at the image at smaller sizes.)

The grain in your phone pictures is noise caused by the camera automatically increasing the ISO setting, which makes it more sensitive and produces a brighter image but increases noise. The best (and only, really) way to fix it on a cellphone is to add more light, lots and lots more light. 

Studio shots like these are taken at ISO 100 (or maybe ISO 50 on a very few incredibly expensive cameras) to keep noise at a minimum because the photographer can add as much light as necessary. 

That said, your phone has a physically smaller sensor (just 4.5 mm wide) than a pro DSLR (36 mm wide, or almost 54mm wide on medium format), so the images captured by the cellphone will have greater depth of field but less color, dynamic range, and sharpness even if the pro camera and the phone have the same resolution. 

There's more to it, but that's why your phone makes noisier images than a pro DSLR. You can fix most of it by adding lots of light to the picture, though. 

Edit: I based phone sensor size off of an iPhone, but it's close enough for the point. "
V171,AskReddit,1390155293.0,"Insinuating that gay people would be better off acting like the Wills rather than the Jacks is the entire reason for gay pride parades. In a world where literally everything is tailored to straight people and straight culture, it's nice to have an event and a space where we aren't pressured into acting a certain way. The flamboyant gay men aren't acting like that to cause a stir. That's just how they are. That's who they want to be. And society tells them that they are messed up for it.

&gt; * **Southwest:** Passengers should plan on purchasing an extra seat or risk being asked to do so at the airport by staff. If the flight is not sold out, the passenger may claim a refund.

&gt; * **American:** Passengers over 250 pounds should recognize that there may be limitations to the service that the airline can provide. However, it does not require that you purchase an extra seat automatically.

&gt; * **United:** No policy whatsoever.

&gt; * **Midwest:** Like Southwest, passengers are encouraged to know their needs in advance. If staff determine that two seats are required, the seat will be sold at the lowest possible fare, with a refund available if there is one or more open seats on the flight.

&gt; * **Air France:** Passengers with ""high body mass"" may receive a 25 percent discount on an extra seat, knowing that if they choose to not buy the seat, they may risk not being able to fly.

&gt; * **JetBlue:** You are required to buy a second seat, and there are no refunds.

&gt; * **Delta:** The airline ""works to accommodate"" passengers with special needs. Upon request and availability, it will try to make sure the next seat is unoccupied. However, if the plane is full, you will most likely be asked to leave the flight and buy a second seat on the next available flight. (You can actually count on this being a fairly typical practice on most airlines.)


I'm not sure if policies have changed in the last few years, but it does seem like airlines are trying (or tried) to deal with it."

Honestly, it sounds like she is unavailable in multiple ways, so you just need to move on.  Don't contact her for any reason, and if you see her in person, walk away (or tell her you don't want to talk to her and to respect that).

You seem somewhat stuck on her a bit, so just try to change your frame of reference.  You are young and have only met a handful of people in your life, and already someone like this popped up.  

That doesn't mean you have found ""the one"", it means that as you meet more people and expand your horizons, you will meet more and more people like her.  Not like her as in identical in nature, but people who have the same kind of powerful impact and connection.

Now it's like Sherwood has come along and dug the whole thing up and built a shack. It looks nice but it's going to come undone. 

The Swansea goal was a prime example of this. There was a lack of discipline and general all round sloppyness in the lead up to the goal. I knew Swansea were going to score if we kept playing like that, and they did. After scoring the second we needed to go into AVB-mode and just keep the ball but keep the movement and pressing that worked so well at times.

An even bigger concern is why, if we choose to be so open, did we score so few goals today? The main argument for playing like this is that it gets you goals but we were so wasteful today. 

These two things have been the things that have been a problem with Spurs for many years, at least since the end of the 80's. We lack a clinicalness that other teams have.

Boiling the water reduces it's oxygen content and makes the coffee tast flat.  (wait, I can't find that anywhere...but here is what I found:)

&gt;Boiling was the main method used for brewing coffee until the 1930s[3] and is still used in some Nordic and Middle Eastern countries.[4] The aromatic oils in coffee are released at 96 °C (205 °F), which is just below boiling, while the bitter acids are released when the water has reached boiling point.[5]

&gt;The brewing temperature of the water used is very important. It should be between 195 F (91 C) and 205 F (96 C). The closer to 205 F (96 C) the better.

When everything was going well, and she was feeling secure in the relationship, the sex was fantastic, with the most intimate and intensely emotional love making that I've ever experienced. But when she wasn't feeling secure (even though i had done nothing to cause it) her need was insane. Beautiful love making that ended with the most intense simultaneous orgasms every single night became anger if our sessions didn't last for at least 2 hours and she didn't have at least 10 orgasms every single day.When the circumstances caused by her insecurities forced us apart, and our love kept bringing us back together, they started to manifest themselves as violence.Further to this, when the final stages of the relationship was going down, i was finding that I was masturbating more, often 3 times a day if time allowed, but it wasn't because it felt good, but because in some ways it made me feel less bad."

All of the battles (except the last one) are 6 turns.  So DD, Attack, DD, Attack (EQ is usually strong enough).  Use the XP/Prize Money O-Powers. The Battle with the Lucario, Togekiss, and Floatzel will be the most annoying.  They all love to use protect, and mess up your turn count.  On the last battle, just DD once, use Fire Punch (because there's a Chatot and if it rotates in, EQ will miss), and then Outrage.  Easy way to hit the 4 turn count.

Other than that...try to get your turn count to the 6 turns (4 on the last battle) and you will get plenty of XP and lots of money.

At level 60, it didn't need any help.  It leveled up pretty quickly from the battles, just like my other Pokes.  Trying to get Lucky Eggs will help, too.

BTW, I am assuming here that there is no husband or boyfriend.  If there is, you need to extricate yourself immediately.

Looking to the side bar, specifically the [prep guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/rhcws/an_introduction_to_preppy_fashion_repost_for_the/) will help. Is there any specific way you want to expand? For example, I'm looking to expand my shoes this season more than anything else, so I can create more cohesiveness with my fits.

If there's nothing specific that you're looking for, I suggest adding some more basic tops, a few t shirts, long sleeve ts, or henleys, and a plain sweater/sweatshirt in grey/navy. A pair of lighter bottoms in a neutral tone, like an olive, grey, or charcoal would also help balance your weekly averages from being 'red' heavy. However, not knowing where you live, maybe its best to save those for next fall, and focus on summer purchases. Your call.

SOSBTK,Metal,1390156266.0,"I am turning 20 next month so I am finishing up my career as a teen-metalhead and here is my musical progression;

12-13 I got out of a very short shitty-rap phase and started listening to metal. I had always passively enjoyed some Sabbath but never really got into it. First band I really got into was Slipknot and while I know they are by no means the best band in the world I am not sure why they get so much hate. 

14-15 Got into the scrEmo thing a little too much. Bring Me The Horizon was a frequent listen on my part. Also started exploring black metal like Dimmu Borgir and Behemoth. Interest in Punk music started at this time and grew simultaneously but separately.

16-17 No scrEmo by this point. Melodic Death and Symphonic metal styles start gaining a lot of interest now. Started looking into the history of Black Metal in Norway with the church arsons.

18-present Folk Metal and Melodic Death are the two biggest genres metal-wise for me now. Finding the pagan roots of black metal helped to fuel this but the genres tend to speak for themselves.

the point of all of that; people will always like things that are stupid to someone else but they will also like something bad ass. I was the kid who listened to both Black Metal and the 'core' genres and the kid you see may be showing off an Asking Alexandria shirt but have nothing but Slayer in his head. Let the kid grow up and establish his style before judging.

But don't tolerate any of that hardcore-dancing bullshit."

You have every right to not want a drunk abusive man passed out in your child's room. His attack on you and his family is NOT your fault. 

He hit you in the face, and you not only want to go to work tomorrow, but leave him alone with your son. Do you not see how irrational that is?

madhjsp,nfl,1390156315.0,"Well obviously every team shares the same core goal of winning the Super Bowl. And obviously no professional athlete will ever admit that they are satisfied with simply making the playoffs but not advancing.  

The Lions (27-37) actually haven't been any better than the Titans (28-36) over the last 4 seasons, so it's not as if they've been right on the cusp of greatness. I think their higher perceived playoff expectations are derived from the fact that they are just a higher-profile team with several very high-profile players, whereas the Titans fly under most everyone's radar.  

In any event, all indications are that Whiz and Webster want to change the culture and build a football team in their image (a welcome change of scenery, given the past decade of mediocrity and sameness), which is a process that isn't done overnight. With that in mind, I think most reasonable fans who recognize that have tempered their expectations: let's build a roster with playoff-caliber depth and coaching first and set ourselves up for stability and success long-term, so we can then identify what needs to address to gear up for a Super Bowl run. Sure, every fan's dream is for their team to bring home the Lombardi trophy, but if I had a choice, I'd much prefer that we accomplish that during a run of sustained success than having one great flukey year.

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390156414.0,"&gt;I use TV to find out arcehtypes and behaviour and such-

I think your attention to/analysis of it is probably far more involved and thoughtful than the average watcher who is probably viewing it to feed their inner voyeur or because they just like to watch train-wrecks (Honey Boo-Boo anyone?).  Tumblr has become a showcase for reactionary idiots/SJW stereotypes who want to feel like they are standing for something without actually knowing what that thing is about or examine the issue within the big picture and from all sides.  Facebook is going downhill quick, pretty much going to become the next Myspace, except for adults.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390156422.0,"Even if the results were true (which I'm not sure they are), lack of regulation would probably have severe negative societal consequences. Our cities might look like those in china right now....smog filled and polluted. We might see even more accidents similar to the BP spill or that recent spill in West virginia....we certainly would have certain sections of the population worse off without Johnson's war on poverty. We might've had  severe economic crashes as 2008-esque crashes might have happened every few years or something. And honestly, given the same decline in union power, etc., I'm not sure the wealth would trickle down, etc. 

That being said, I think this study seems to be a little overly simplistic and fails to take all possible variables into consideration. I doubt we'd be in a futuristic society right now that is much better off if government regulation didn't exist. There are too many variables at work, and those government regulations often limit negative externalities and all. It's not that government regulations are meant to inhibit growth...they're also meant to keep us and our environment safe...and you know,...DO things."

If a guy just makes conversation with me in a normal setting for conversation I don't necessarily know if he's just making conversation or his goal is to hit on me.

ActingPower,mylittlepony,1390156633.0,"[](/twiponder-i) I may just be biased towards this show, but I think our background ponies are just plain old more interesting. For comparison, [here](http://www.wallpapershdi.com/picture/22a281a1711d6183af4b2c91479a9f21/spongebob-background_1280x800.jpg)'s a crowd picture from Spongebob, while [here](http://seanmills6.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-derpy-wants-to-be-asertive.jpg)'s a crowd picture from Friendship is Magic. I was gonna say there's more variety in ours than theirs, but that's... actually the opposite of true. I could probably argue that there's some sort of ""Uncanny Valley"" of variety going on, that the large amount of variety in the Spongebob characters isn't as effective to me as the simple variety to the ponies, but I believe it boils down to something else entirely.

The cutie mark.

[](/rdhappy-i) Not only does every pony have a certain tribe and mane color and type, but every pony has a unique cutie mark. That means that you can't help but start thinking, ""What is this pony like? What's their life story? How did they get that mark?"" I don't get that with other background characters. Sure, sometimes they'll do something interesting and it'll get me thinking about why they act that way, but that matches the origin stories of the main background ponies, like Derpy, Lyra, Octavia, and Vinyl. But what about Carrot Top? Colgate? Cloud Kicker? No, our characters naturally provoke interest, and I think that's why.

[](/takealetter-i) FAKE EDIT: I think the Uncanny Valley thing bears explaining. Suppose you graphed the variation between characters versus the tendency to individualize and single out those characters. Characters who are all exactly the same would obviously be impossible to differentiate. Characters with some differences would be easier to single out. But, according to my theory, when you hit a certain point where two characters are vastly different from each other, the uniqueness of those characters starts going down. If I had to guess, that's because they are so different from each other that you stop thinking in terms of individual parts and just start classifying them as different things. Ponies hit that sweet spot where they have a lot of variation in color and tribe, but they all share the same general body structure. That means you can individualize them without sorting them into ""blue ones"" or ""pegasus ones."" Maybe. I don't know."

My wardrobe looks wonderful, for fall and spring but summer is going to be rough. Minus I just ripped out the ass on my new pair of Club Monaco chinos, by bending over next to the edge of my desk, which apparently is very sharp (how dumb can I be?). Its not even on a stitch line so they're just goners. The only real wardrobe gap I can identify myself is that I need a good pair of casual shoes that aren't sneakers, to go with some of my fits. A pair of loafers or mocs sockless for the summer, since I bought sperrys that are too big to go sockless and I've been 'getting away' with using them as loafers, and will continue to do so until they break next season. Living in Canada sucks for shoes, because finding bucks doesnt happen, and you have to travel to Toronto for loafers, and even then, the quality isn't on par with Quoddy/Rancourt/Oak street. Hoping to travel across the border, or find a boutique sometime once I isolate a store that will have my size in one of the styles I want. If anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears.

Littlereds,weddingplanning,1390157033.0,"So like many people have already said, get an idea of a date in your mind, if you live in a seasonal area, do you want snow on the ground, do you want it to be sunny and warm, are you okay if it rains etc. 

The other big thing that I think you need to do before you start checking out venues is decide on a budget. Figure out who is helping you pay, if it's just you and/or your fiance, and/or both sets of parents. Somebody else mentioned the knot. It has a budget tool that I found really helpful in planning. You decide on the amount, put it in and from there it fills in suggestions on what you should spend on just about everything. The knot also has a timeline tool that is nice so you don't have to stress about getting the little things done right away. 

Another great website was wedding.com it takes a lot of the stress out of trying to find vendors. You put in stuff about you and your fiance and what you want your wedding to be like and from there vendors will contact you and tell you what they have to offer so you don't have to search them out. Although if you are not in the US I don't know if it'll work. 

So first things first, I'd start out with thinking about a date (or really a season), a budget, and a rough estimate of the number of people. You will want to know this before looking at venues. You don't want to fall in love with a venue that seats 75 people when you are having 150 at your wedding, and vice versa there are gorgeous wedding venues that seat 500 people but they're just impractical and too expensive for a small ceremony or reception.

Devium92,Guelph,1390157050.0,"I might look into that. I've had nothing but bad experiences with my dentist. For example:

As a child I had a back molar completely rot through. The only option was to yank that puppy. We all agreed. I came back a week later (was scheduled for a half hour cleaning, not enough time to freeze and yank the tooth as he was booked solid that day). So a week goes by and he freezes my mouth. Now I'm already crap terrified of needles. So I'm anxious about the scary (seemingly huge) dental needle coming straight for my face and he has to do my facial nerves in my cheek and my hard palate (roof of my mouth) because it's an upper molar. Yeah so after much pain and suffering due to that whole process my 8 year old brain is already ""noping"" the fuck out of there. I want nothing to do with this bullshit anyway. Well he starts doing his thing getting the tooth loosened and I start to literally scream because it fucking hurts. The damn freezing didn't take! My cheek and lips are numb but my gums aren't! I tell him ""it's hurting please stop, freeze me more"" his response? ""Oh it's just pressure not pain you're fine."" and continues! I remember nearly blacking out from the pain. Hysterical crying, shaking so much he had to have the dental assistant hold my head steady. I was traumatized. This is why I need the sedation.

I might see what her available options are because she sounds like the kind of dentist I need. I have a head full of issues that really need to be addressed but I'm far too scared to go back to my current dentist. 

I appreciate the recommendation though even if she doesn't do the sedation for a normal cleaning, although I'm not sure if that's available anyway!

Knowing that she actually took the time (and I'm assuming listened if/when you said can I take 5 minutes please) eases my mind that I'd be okay there."

panthur,marketing,1390157204.0,"/u/ifeelhome has got it covered.

Many of the MA tools have anonymous web tracking for your site, some of them charge extra for it. Anonymous visitor tracking is the bomb because they use IP to look up the company of folks who are visiting your site. So you know who they are before they identify themselves. But its up to you if that's a feature that you want and if it's worth it.

We use Silverpop (starts at $750 a mo or so) which is a more B2C focused email company but it has MA tools. But they charge an extra $250 a month for anonymous visitor tracking. I demo'd a tool called Optify which was amazing and included it but they are now defunct. Act-on is similar (more for smaller B2Bs). They have pricing right on their site so you can see what the ranges are. It's by ""active contacts"".

Another cool feature some of them have is tracking your SEM and SEO as well as social features. So it depends on which marketing channels you use too.

Pardot is owned by Salesforce and I've heard it has a great and easy user interface. Marketo and Eloqua have more extensive tools and capabilities. Eloqua being the most advanced and expensive.

Whatever you hone in on, make sure you can get a demo for like 30 days if you can, even if its on a sample site. Get an idea of what it can do."

Those $5000 savings should be viewed as an emergency fund.  Trouble is, you're planning on having a $700 emergency every month for the next 7.  That's not what an e-fund is for.  An e-fund is for things you don't see coming!  And there will be some.

If I were you, I would dump the expensive cable and replace it with netflix, dump as many of the cell phones as you can, get a basic cell phone, get very basic cheap internet service, quit contributing extra to the student loans, dial down the 401(k) contributions to the employer match amount, and start building an emergency fund if there's any left over.

The receiver includes a device called an interrupter which is supposed to only allow one round at a time to pop up and prevent the problem.  However, many Mosin's either have interrupters that don't work correctly, or the spacing between the receiver and the stock is incorrect after 50+ years in storage, so that rimlock can happen even with a working interrupter.

You can tinker with your rifle to try and fix the problem, or just load by hand and be sure that the rim of the round you're loading is in front of the rim of the top round in the mag."

The fact is that (especially if you're a straight man) there's massive cultural pressure towards _monogamy._ I think that creates an environment that can feel unfair.

So then we eventually had sex but I knew it was gonna be a short term thing for sure, the weapon thing scared the fuck out of me. After that, I didn't talk to him as much and then later got a text from his girlfriend asking if I'd been talking to him. So there's that.. (He didn't tell me obviously) He then later on was talking to one of my friends about his view on girls and how he likes to test them and feels like a girl shouldn't be mad if a guy has a girlfriend when he sleeps with you and a bunch of other illogical bullshit. I just am so glad I'm not about to be his damn baby mama."

- Cook ahead and freeze individual portions for lunch at school/placement AND extra dinners. Some nights you'll be tired and take out is tempting. Better for your body and even better for your wallet.

- make sure you eat small snacks through out your shift/long days at school. Make sure to include something high in protein (I always have almonds and prunes). If you get really hungry, your blood sugar dips and once you get home you'll wanna eat EVERYTHING.

- getting regular exercise is really hard with a crazy, unpredictable schedule + a zillion papers. Find something that works? (I biked to school for 3 years!)

I guess the main reason I'd think that Manziel (or another QB) would be the Jaguars' pick is that the QB position is much more difficult to address in free agency than some of the other holes that the team might have, and it's been obvious for 2 seasons now that the Jags desperately need improvement at that position.

It turned out to be a candlelit dinner under a painted tapestry of Paris.  The meal was completely cooked by himself and if that wasn't enough, he cleared room for a dance floor (They swing dance a lot) and made a stage with a film of a life size Frank Sinatra singing.

Right now, WalMart (for example) has all the power over the workers, since they are exploiting the fact that people need to work to live, and that they don't have to provide adequate wages when people are desperate enough. By increasing peoples' wages, WalMart must respect that they have a position of bargaining power, since their work is worth a good share of the crop now. The increased wages also lead to increased economic mobility, meaning people will have more ability to leave for better jobs.

That last option is apparently fairly rare, or people here don't talk about it anyways, but I can't vape some flavorings.  Any MBV juice with cinnamon or ginger in it destroys my throat, like after a day with it I'm wondering if my throat is bleeding.

All are transmittable via oral sex. The risk gets higher if there are any cuts on the genitalia or in the mouth. It is extremely foolish to believe you are any more unlikely to contract an STD via oral sex than standard sex. I can provide scientific literature if you would like, but I believe it would kind of be a moot point.

Edit: Can everyone please stop assuming I am talking about HIV? I am talking about STDs in general. My argument is not based on HIV, other than the fact that it is an STD. For the record - yes, *HIV is less likely* to be contracted orally, but it still can be. This does not modify the fact that other STDs are just as likely to be contracted orally as via insertion intercourse.

I had one group though who killed a sizable dragon and instead of carving it up and selling it, donated the body to the local inn they frequented during downtime.  The innkeeper had a lot of contacts, and eventually, the dragon was stuffed and mounted in the central room near the fireplace.  The inn changed its name to the Dragon's Head Inn, and the players received a cut of the profits for the rest of their lives as well as a free place to stay/eat/stay connected to other quest givers.

Dog trainers are not wells of knowledge in regards to the physiology of dogs. I'd be willing to guess you didn't hear this whole ""scent"" thing from the vet, because it's not something that a veterinary school teaches, because it isn't true. 

&gt; I have had a huge number of pups, and pretty much 100% of the time adult dogs will accept the puppy.

This is true of almost all mammals that operate under any biological response resembling pack behavior. Do you think all their offspring give off a ""scent""? Of course not. 

&gt; Now, if this smell is the smell that informs other dogs it's a puppy I have no idea.

So why in the world did you try to pass this idea as a fact?

It's very weird how some dog owners operate. It's all too common to hear some off-the-wall ""fact"" regarding dog behavior or biology spouted off by a dog owner who then tries to back up their story by relaying how much ""experience"" they have. As though there is not a huge wealth of knowledge about dogs that comes from professionals that would quickly disprove their ""fact"". "

blue_eyes13,MakeupAddiction,1390158644.0,"Ok so its funny you just posted this, because I bought some bare minerals powder foundation two days ago (haven't used it for years, but figured I'd give it a try again) and this EXACT thing happened to me. I don't usually have that issue at all so I think it might just be that formula of powder foundation clings to dry patches. I too have horribly acne prone skin, as well as it being really sensitive- anything and everything will either irritate it or cause me to break out, including cerave....tried that one for awhile. I know that some people say it's bad to exfoliate your skin too much but I have to do it every day or else I get patches like you're talking about here. So here is my favorite combination of products &amp; techniques I have found so far that don't break me out and don't show my dry patches:

*I use burts bees fabulously fresh body wash in the shower with a wash cloth to exfoliate, then burts bees sensitive skin face lotion right out of the shower if I use any lotion at all. Lotion sort of makes things worse for me especially in the warmer months. I've started using [the yes to blueberries facial wipes](http://www.target.com/p/yes-to-blueberries-age-refresh-facial-towelettes-25-ct/-/A-13361553) in the morning for a little bit of moisture that doesn't make me greasy or clog my pores. I usually use witch hazel on a cotton pad or soap and water at night to wash my face/exfoliate, and I've found that if I'm having a break out the [yes to grapefruit wipes](http://www.target.com/p/yes-to-grapefruit-brightening-facial-towelettes-25-ct/-/A-14529606#prodSlot=medium_1_1&amp;term=yes+to+grapefruit+wipes) clear my skin up overnight. I feel a little guilty throwing all this stuff out after using it but my skin has improved drastically since starting to use all natural stuff instead of things like aveeno, cerave, clean and clear, olay, and etc.

*Kat von D tattoo foundation in 42 light (i can't even find this shade for sale anymore unfortunately) applied with a damp beauty blender sponge- one pump does my whole face. If I use a primer I'll use the monistat anti-chafing gel which is a smashbox photo finish primer dupe- if I use that too often it will clog up my pores though. I find the damp sponge helps make sure I don't get too thick of a layer of makeup while still giving me good coverage.

*[Covergirl Clean Pressed Powder for Sensitive Skin](http://www.covergirl.com/face-makeup/face-powder-foundation/powder-foundation-for-sensitive-skin-clean). It comes with one of those little powder puff things but I use a brush like [this](http://qualityvaluestyle.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/product_full/products/product_images/10-1503%20QVS%20Flat%20Top%20Powder%20Brush.png) to apply it. 

Those are just things I've found after a lot of trial and error. I honestly believe that the majority of soaps and lotions that are sold are terrible for your skin if it is sensitive and very acne prone. My best friends sister is a dermatologist and recommended cerave to me as well and it make me break out horribly. I had to really start researching ingredients in everything I put on my skin or in my hair and be very careful. 

Sorry this is so long, but its been such a struggle for me I hope this will help you or someone else having the same issues. Basically you want to be careful with things like dimethicone, cetyl alcohol, and methyl paraben for example- these are all added to products to make you feel like your skin or hair is moisturized but are horrible about clogging pores (by the way checking out the ingredient list, cerave has all three of those) after it is usually stripped of all it's natural moisture by things like sodium lauryl/laureth sulfate which is the main sudsing agent in soaps and is so strong it is also used to clean oil off of garage floors. Start looking at ingredient lists of products you're using and you'll be amazed. The products you're using in your hair can also cause acne if they've got some of these ingredients in them. I will admit it is pretty hard to find a foundation without a lot of these ingredients in it though. 

It sounds strange but the more simple the products (meaning you can read the label and actually tell what the ingredients are right off the bat) have worked very well for me. Another thing to think about: salicylic acid is made from willow bark, which is what aspirin is made of. Take two aspirin tablets in the palm of your hand, drop some water on top of them until they crumble into a grainy powder. Use this as a scrub to exfoliate like your peel- it makes your skin SOOO soft. Honey also has antibacterial as well as moisturizing properties &amp; you can use this as a mask if you want. Sorry this was so ridiculously long but I know how frustrating acne and sensitive skin can be and I figured I'd share all my tips that have helped me clear up my skin AND be able to use makeup the way I want to.

We had 16 Cubic meters per second released just for us. It wasn't a super hard descent with perhaps 6 shortish  class 5 sections and 20 or so class 4s, it was just mega dangerous due to the sheer quantity of siphons under boulders,  Sank the raft a few times to get through cracks and avoid portage.

Life-in-Death,vegan,1390158880.0,"I call this the vegan paradox.

The ""requirement"" for meat for cats isn't about protein or taurine.  Taurine is destroyed in cooking, so all cat food has synthetic taurine added.

Meat however is very ""acidic"" and without it a cat's blood pH gets too high.  This can lead to urinary crystals forming which can be quickly fatal.

I recently saw a vegan cat food that supposedly addressed this problem but I haven't done any research.

So, options you have are:
  
1. Incorporate some vegan cat food with some meat food.  
2. Cheaper cat foods are made with by-products, which is less animals killed (Though I would not do this to my cat!)  
3. Organ-meat based cat food *may* not drive # of animals killed as much.

Lithuim,AskReddit,1390158881.0,"An adult chimpanzee is extremely strong, very smart, and can become very aggressive if upset or feeling territorial.

They've been known to beat people to death.

The chimps you see in movies and TV are all juveniles.

Dogs have been selectively bred for thousands of years to make sure that the adults are relatively docile around humans and will not attempt to install themselves as the pack alpha.

Chimps might decide they'll make a better alpha and come at you.

She kept falling asleep during the Packers game and we went on a 30 point run during that game.

My other cat has taken it upon himself to sing the song of his peoples every night between 11:00-12:30 and from 4am onwards.

That star wars action figure from 1980 you never played with and kept ona shelf? expense, not investment. Your house? expense, not investment. You car? expense. Even gold, which every commercial and newspaper and most ""investors"" buy? expense. The only time anything like that rises in value is when you can convince some other shmuk that it's an investment too. Ant that continues until people realize it doesn't create anything.

Investments are things that make you money, not from sale, but from just owning it. Stocks that pay dividends, businesses, bank accounts, rental proprties, golden egg-laying geese - those are investments."

the-axis,Magicdeckbuilding,1390159372.0,"Of course the best guy to go with equipment is stoneforge mystic, but that is almost as expensive as the swords now.  Steelshaper's Gift will find one dirt cheap.  Quest for the holy relic takes awhile to setup but you can cheat a sword in and equip at the same time (to either an unblocked attacker to win or to make your opponent less likely to block since you can instantly pump any guy).

The loxodon and leonin tribe both have lots of interactions with equipment, so you might want to look at them for creatures.  Loxodon punisher gets huge fast with a couple equipment, and Kemba starts shitting blockers the more equipments he has.

And of course RichdiculousRichie has a good point with both stonehewer Giant and Puresteel Paladin being pretty great as well.

One of the problems I've had with building equipment based decks is running into only creatures or only equipment, so Lingering Souls giving you 4 creatures in a single card (over 2 turns in case you run into board wipes) is a nice feature.

You can look at legacy esper deathblade type decks to see some of the best equipment interactions, but there are plenty of other casual (and cheaper) options out there, it just all depends on what you are looking for."
KeptInStitches,sewing,1390159374.0,I agree you would likely need to have tulle removed from under the skirt. $100 seems a little low but is probably about right for just a hem. There is no detailing on the hem that would have to be raised. The fact that they didn't recommend removing some tulle as well seems fishy and will cost extra but since tulle doesn't need a finished edge they could just cut it away. I agree with /u/ambInc38 that if you can wait more spring styles will show up. Also check department store websites you may be able to find a white tea length gown  for a reasonable price that can be dressed up a bit.

broken42,Nerf,1390159397.0,"Regardless of what you preference is, be it chest rig, crossdraw, plate carrier, etc, I'd highly suggest you invest in something that uses MOLLE. MOLLE stands for Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment and comes with PALS, or Pouch Attachment Ladder System, webbing either in parts or throughout the vest/rig. The great thing about using MOLLE gear is that it is highly customizable. 

One of both the upsides and downsides  of MOLLE vests is that you purchase the pouches and bags that attach to the vest separately, this makes it a bit more expensive but it lets you put only what you want/need and not have any dead pouch space. I've found personally that AK mag pouches work lovely for Nerf mags, they have to take into consideration the sharper curve of the AK mag so it leaves plenty of space for the width of the Nerf mag. M14 mag pouches also work rather well for Nerf mags, they just tend to have a shallower pouch than AK mags due to the shorter length of the M14 magazine. Whatever you do, DO NOT use M4/M16/STANAG mag pouches as they are not wide enough to fit a Nerf mag.

I personally have [this chest rig](http://www.evike.com/products/34527/) and [this plate carrier](http://www.evike.com/products/29609/) that I use for both Nerf (HvZ and Nerf wars) as well as airsoft. I haven't run the plate carrier for Nerf yet, it was a Christmas present to myself, but for the rig I run with a dual double stack AK mag, which will fit 2 18 dart mags per pouch, along with a utility pouch for dart storage. I also will be adding a dump pouch for future games, again part of a Christmas present to myself, to make it easier to dump spent magazines."

kiwirish,CFB,1390159539.0,"College Football just has more innovation. The fact that the players aren't so stupidly good in college than they are in the NFL is why I find it better to watch. The players are only a few years removed from High School and they're not perfect, the QBs throw dumb picks, the RBs maddeningly fumble the ball, the kickers can't always get shortish field goals or even PATs all the time. It's so frustrating, but it means that anything is possible, and that offenses and defenses are different.

The different formations that work, Florida won two NCGs with armpunting Tebow because you can take more risks with your players. Georgia Tech still runs the Triple Option. There's random defenses that exist and are invented for best use with your personnel and the coaches make ballsier decisions. 

And the rivalries mean something huge as well. In the NFL you play your rivals twice a year and often in the playoffs too, and your players can even end up on their team the next season, but in college your guys are there for 2-4 years and aren't touching your rival, you play them once a year and get true bragging rights for the other 364 days."

Ralkir,changemyview,1390159565.0,"&gt; that all people who encourage restraint were just insecure about their own sexuality

I see this a lot everywhere. People say ""insecurity"" like it's a bad thing that should be overcome. But the truth of the matter is that everyone is insecure (in some way) and these insecurities will not be overcome. Exclusivity in and of itself can be demonstratively defined as an insecurity. 
 
With that said, insecurities are not inherently bad, and are actually manifested as peoples preferences. So while your current preference for lots of sex is not inherently bad in and of itself. There might come a day when the perfect partner is presented to you, this person you want in your life for the rest of yours, and this person might not be able to handle all of your past partners. Yes it is an insecurity, is it wrong, no. Could they overcome it, possibly. But it's a risk you take. And as I see it, there is nothing wrong with someone wanting low amounts of sexual partners in their partner.

Omega037,relationships,1390159653.0,"Relationships are at will.  She doesn't need a good reason or any reason at all to end things.  All that matters is that it is over and now you need to move on.

That said, these things take time, especially with a relationship as long as yours was.  However, it will get better.  I am guessing that it is better today than it was a week after, and certainly better than a day after it happened.

In the meantime, I don't think you should be looking for someone else right now.  I think it is time to turn inward for introspection and growth.  You are young and this relationship will be a formative experience in your life.  Your next relationships will be stronger and healthier because of what you learned from this one.  Just make sure not to repeat your mistakes.

So my advice is try new things, meet new people, read great books, go new places, and in general have as many new experiences as possible.  Each new experience will help you grow away from the person you were and into someone new."

And as you say, English is clearly on the easier side of the Indo-European languages - I've also studied Russian and the grammar gives me headache. =)

The hardest part of English is that the vocabulary is really huge - there's zillions of synonyms for everything, and loads of irregular verbs and whatnot. The grammar isn't too difficult. And coming from Finnish, there's a few superfluous features in English that drive me mad - in particular the distinction between genders in pronouns (Finnish has only ""hän"" for ""he/she"", but on the other hand, we have ""sinä/te"" - singular and plural ""you"" =), and the necessity of all these bloody articles (Finnish doesn't use ""a"" or ""the"" at all)."

I don't like this ""do-nothing"" approach. It reeks of the same type of argument people had about slavery. Yeah, farms are indeed more automated now than when there was cheap slave-labor to use, but that didn't harm the slaves that now had the opportunity at a better life. Minimum wage is a bad concept as a starter, but now that it's already instituted, we have to work with it, and the first thing we need to do is make it so that the bottom wage-earners in the US are earning a human wage.

No one is worth shit, no matter if their job is just to scoop shit. They are humans trading their time for money in order to provide a company with a service. If that company is exploiting its workforce and stealing their value from them at alarming rates, then someone needs to step in and tell them ""NO. You can't hire a hundred people and hold them at poverty wages while you walk away with the profits of their work."" 

It doesn't matter if the work is low skilled. It matters that the work these people are doing is earning the company their profits, and the fact that the company is not compensating its workforce for a job well done is just bullshit."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390159756.0,"As a highly sexaly active female myself, a few cautionaries:

(1) There is no such thing as ""safe sex"" only ""safer sex."" Herpes and HPV are transmittable with condoms, and orally through kissing, which then you can transmit with your own saliva to your genitals. HPV is linked to oral cancers, as well as cervical and colon cancer. [wiki page, article links at bottom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV-positive_oropharyngeal_cancer)

(2) I see no reason to pick some arbitrary number to limit yourself with, but choosing partners should be done with care to your physical safety, (among other things).  There are scary people out there. It helps in this regard to have *great* instincts about people, or learn to hone them. *(Which, unfortunately I have no idea how to suggest doing at the moment.)*  But also, it makes good sense to get to know someone well enough through others that you *might* hear about any anger issues they have, or violent outbursts. Hearing from their previous partners is best. Men are not the best to listen to here, their instincts, in my experience, are not good in this department. If a woman ever says, ""I don't know what it is, but something about him scares me,"" you don't have to swallow it hook, line and sinker, but be on your guard.

(2.5) There are people that devalue promiscuous women to the point where their right to physical safety is viewed as diminished or nonexistent. Even making sure there is no physical evidence (and guys can be sneaky about hiding cams, your own place might be safest), word will get out if you stay in one area long enough. Be on the look out for these people, and especially for these thoughts in potential partners.

(2.75) I cannot stress enough how vulnerable you are alone with someone you don't know well. Casual sex doesn't have to be dangerous. But sex with someone you don't know well is never going to be completely safe.

*EDIT: Not related to CMV, but please forgive this health advisement.*

*Be sure to include barriers when oral sex is performed on you. Dental dams, or cutting a condom and spreading that. This is something I see used not at all outside of the kink community and it concerns me. I use this on girls, it's different, not as fun, and has a bit of a learning curve, but it is just plain dangerous not to use. After 4 or 5 tries, I get what I'm doing now. Holding it in place isn't bad, but occasionally after 10ish minutes I have to pitch it and get a new one, since part of it folded up on itself.*"

Why do you keep talking about what range you need to get in to kill a certain enemy? The liberty launcher does 40-70 damage at med range and only 80-85 at point blank, for that extra 15 damage you dont need to stand looking a pyro's flamethrower in the face. The soldier isnt a point blank range class, the reason you keep dying is because you're not where you are supposed to be, and also you cant aim. 

&gt;You just end up wanting to go heavy

You should if thats how you are going to play. You dont rocket jump tactically once, you are supposed to use the weapon for mobility but instead you stand around choke points and wait to die, over and over, go use the beggar's bazooka if thats what you are going to do.

1:46 Why didnt you go stand on that other spot near the cliff? or in that building with the health pack, you have a fast rocket, the difference in distance wont hit you as hard. If you get into trouble at that range you can easily rocket jump back to the health pack which is on that little wooden ledge.

There is no class that you could kill from full health with a rocket launcher crit that you cant kill with a liberty launcher crit. 

8:10-8-30 you pathetically fail to rocket jump up those stairs 3 fucking times then you miss that sniper walking in a straight line with a weapon that does splash damage. 

8:45ish you are fighting that scout and you have done enough damage after 2 rockets to kill him with the next but then you proceed to miss 4 more fucking times.

She was super nice one day and the next she was trying to get you fired because you did or said something she didn't like. She constantly talked about everyone behind their backs. I think it was a game for her to turn people against each other. I worked with her for 6 years and for the first 3, she made my life a living hell. After that, I just tuned her out. Unless it was about work, I wouldn't even acknowledge her. After a year of that, anytime I was within earshot of her, she would politely suggest I kill myself. I would just smile and nod and move on. After 2 more years of not being able to get under my skin, she eventually gave my boss an ultimatum, me or her. Boss chose her and fired me. Turns out 2 weeks after I was fired, she quit anyway. It was just one more game she was playing but this time she was playing with my boss and ended up screwing him over pretty bad. This was back in 2008. Last year I ran into her in a bar and she saw me before I saw her. She stood on a bar stool, pointed in my direction and yelled across the bar 'Get your cunt ass out of MY bar!'. I just smiled, and nodded, and continued on with my friends as she was escorted out.

My advice is the following.  Tell her that your feelings for her are real but you understand that she needs time.  Then say that if/when she is ready to let you know, but otherwise it is probably for the best if you don't spend time together anymore.

Pachacamac,AskAnthropology,1390160174.0,"Those books should be available, but if not then there is likely an option to get them through inter-library loan. You can always go talk to a librarian and they will be helpful getting stuff for you.

I haven't read Graeber but that sounds like a highly specific theory. Sure, states developed when *someone* was able to amass resources and control, but there's no way to know whether it was religious leaders, a very influential leader, a group of people, or even something more random like a certain family just happening to have the land that gave the best crop yields. The specific way that each state developed is surely different, and individual agency (like a really influential person who became a community leader) must have played a larger role than we generally recognize (because we can't see that archaeologically), but as a general anthropological theory all we can say is that a surplus of resources was required and this led to some people not having to work to get food because they could be given food in exchange for labour, and this meant there was skilled labour and skilled artisans that could build complicated things and develop their artistry, and there was surplus food for a bureaucracy that could administer the commands of the leadership, and so on. And then you have a state.

If you want to get into the seminal anthropological theory of state formation then the best books to read are Morton Fried (1967) *The Evolution of Political Society: An Essay in Political Anthropology* and Elman Service (1975) *Origins of the State and Civilization: The Process of Cultural Evolution.* But if you just want something more introductory, then that Yoffee book I mentioned above is really good for both introducing theories of state formation, and then kinda ripping them apart. And Trigger's book is a beast (I've never read the whole thing), but it is a detailed discussion on how the state formed independently in the seven different places that it did (well, seven according to him. He considers the Yoruba in Africa to be an independent development of the state, but I've never seen anyone else claim that. Most anthropologists would say that the state formed six times).

So, back to what led to state formation. This has become another really long post and I always have stuff to do, so I'm going to suggest reading those books because they are all a good overview of the various ideas. Just know that no one theory has really gelled as *the* accepted theory. We know that management of resources is hugely important, but we don't know exactly what led to resources being managed in a wildly different way than they were before, and what then led to people giving up their autonomy.

My favourite theory is Robert Carneiro's circumscription theory. Carneiro essentially argued that circumscribed environments are what led to the development of political authority (both chiefdoms and states). Circumscribed environments are places like islands, oases in the desert, etc. that are habitable themselves, but are boxed in by uninhabitable places (the ocean, deserts, etc.) When populations were small or there were large areas of uninhabited space, people could just move from one of these circumscribed environments to the next. But eventually there were people living in the next environments too, so people had to come up with ways to get more food (agriculture) and then even more food (things like irrigation, which require management), and there was increased warfare, and things like that. So political authority develops in a circumscribed environment, and then that society becomes more powerful and is able to exert control over their neighbours, and then you have a state. So it doesn't rely on overpopulation of the entire region, or warfare on a large scale, or anything like that, it just depends on these things happening in one small area. The theory has its flaws, but I still like it on the whole, and it is true that almost all areas where political authority developed are circumscribed in some way (most states developed in arid or semi-arid but mountainous places, and a lot of chiefdoms developed on islands).

But that isn't everything. I also like a mostly-ignored idea of Collin Renfrew's (1986, I think), peer-polity interaction. The basic idea there is that there is positive reinforcement among neighbours competing for resources that ends up leading to more and more complex societies. So you can't say the state developed in this one specific place, but rather there was a region with a lot of similar societies that gradually became more and more complex and each turned into states, and eventually one or two or a few would become more powerful and take over their neighbours. This certainly works well for the coast of Peru, where I work, but I think it is a good theory for other places too.

That's kinda scatterbrained, but it's a start. I can recommend some good papers that you can look at too, if you like."

I *did not* buy Premium for BF4, and I feel pretty good about that now.

I also really enjoyed the Crysis games, and if I had an uber powerful rig that could max them out, they'd be a Day 1 purchase for me just to have the visuals and bragging rights. Alas, I had to play Crysis 3 on Medium High, so I waited til it came down in price.

Deadspace is not a draw for me at all.

SimCity I really wanted, but I could not reconcile the aboslutely bullshit, always-online crap they were feeding us, with my logica and experience that a city building game is primarily a single player, off-line experience, and with my experience of the Diablo 3 disaster. I didn't want any part of that. When they bring offline mode out, I will pick it up during one of the $20 or under sales and it will be worth it. 

I wish EA hadn't royally fucked up Command and Conquer, ad I never even finished the series due to CnC4. Coming off CnC3, I was so pumped for the close of the story and more action. I put down $5 at GameStop. After reading about the changes, I moved my preorder dollars to another purchase and ditched CnC4. I don't feel like I abandoned *it*, *EA* abandoned *me* (and the millions of other fans).

So no, I will not be ditching all of my beloved franchises for some petty ""boycott"": I will be buying them smarter. "

* Steel: Has some season(s) under the belt. Either great DM or decent DM while knowing the meta / good gamesense.

* Silver: More seasons completed, know the meta pretty well, decent DM + practicing a lot more.

I'd recommend going into iron for at least one season unless you think you're DM is good enough to counteract not knowing the meta or having gamesense. (Odds are you won't be able to).


Another great resource is newbie mixes, you'll learn what you need to do and it's a good intro to sixes. 

In terms of roamer v pocket, experiment with both, a good resource here is newbie mixes and do whatever you find more fun. (There also tends to be more roamers than pockets, so finding a team may be slightly harder). Also, the season is going to start soonish, if you're looking for a team, start soonish."

Levels of income and distribution of wealth are not necessarily just. Where the money happens to fall is not necessarily optimum for the efficient running of society. 

Does the CEO of a company who makes hundreds of times more than the cleaner that cleans the building that he works in necessarily work hundreds of times harder? No. ""But he adds more value"" you will say. ""He creates profit, and that's what he's being rewarded for"". 
And does he create profit all on his own, or does he do it with the help of all the people under him in the organisation? Does he and his company not use common infrastructure like roads and bridges, that were paid for by the taxpayer, and things like the internet that were developed by the US military and also had their development paid for by the taxpayer?
Is it not just then that a proportion of the income of the wealthiest members of society be fed back into the great money stream, to ameliorate the worst effects of this ruthless competitive system we all live in? Is it not in fact a good safety valve to prevent the worst miseries of unfettered capitalism? 

Taxation is the price that everybody pays for living in a society with other people, and reaping the benefits of that society. This picture of Homo Americanus as a rugged individualist, wholly cut off from other people and not dependent on them in any way, is one that just doesn't match current economic realities. Industrial capitalism is an inherently interconnected and interdependent system, and I've noticed that the market-individualist ideology mostly tends to flourish in countries with very financialised economies where the population is cut off from the roots of production. 

That's why taxation is necessary. Although of course, people don't like excessive taxation and it can be used unjustly. "

For some reason I was really into this 6 foot, overweight guy who had the world's worst facial hair, long, shoulder length brunette hair and had the worst attitude of any ugly guy I've ever met. I was obviously into him but he was having none of it, but to my surprise one day he asked me out. As soon as I get to his place (I'm looking pretty cute-it is a date, after all), he greets me at the door by telling me, ""Pick up a dog, we're taking them for a walk."" So I have to grab one of his wiener dogs and carry him downstairs and walk around his shitty apartment complex until the dogs shat/pissed. The whole time he said like, two words.

The dogs were being jerks and didn't do their business, so as soon as we got back upstairs one of his dogs peed on the couch and the other one shit on the floor. Okay, I've had worse dates I think...so I shrug it off. Then, we watch some It's Always Sunny, but I'm sitting on this huge couch all by myself and he's all the way on the other side of the room in a recliner, drinking a beer and not looking at me at all. I have been feeling this date sucked, but at this point I think, ""Why the hell would he ask me out if he's not interested?""

So then after a few episodes, he takes me into his bedroom (don't get too excited) to show me an organ that he built. An organ, the musical instrument. He proceeds to play me a piece that he wrote from it, and I can't help but want to kill myself as I'm staring at this dorky, weird 6 foot guy playing this shitty organ in his bedroom. And then he gets REALLY excited, and tells me he writes death metal songs. So then he shows me all of his death metal songs from his computer, which are pretty shitty in general. This went on for at least an hour.

After that, I asked him why he asked me out. He said ""One of my friends thinks you're cute and knows you're interested in me, so he convinced me to give you a chance."" He then told me that I wasn't his type, which I didn't ask, and he said that he would only date blonde hair blue eyed Scandinavian girls. We are in Texas, mind you. One of the smallest country towns in East Texas. How many Scandinavian girls do you think are walking around down here?

He told me then, ""I mean, I guess if I was really drunk, and the lights were out...I could probably muster up the courage to fuck you.""

I just got up and left.

The slaughtering process referred to as dhabīḥah is regulated by a set of rules intended to ensure the health of the animal to be slaughtered and conformance to Islamic religious law, which is derived from the Qur'an and hadiths.

...

However, in a study between 1974 and 1978 Wilhelm Schulze and his colleagues carried out a study at the School of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover University in Germany: ""Attempts to Objectify Pain and Consciousness in Conventional (captive bolt pistol stunning) and Ritual (knife) Methods of Slaughtering Sheep and Calves""[22] is reported on Islamic websites[23][24] to have concluded that ""the Islamic way of slaughtering is the most humane method of slaughter and that captive bolt stunning, practiced in the West, causes severe pain to the animal."" However, recent studies have countered the Schulze study, which is dated and relied on older EEG measurement techniques. Dr. Schulze himself also warned in his report that the stunning technique may not have functioned properly.[25]"

xenonscreams,running,1390161227.0,"**Goal races**: Love 'em or Leave 'em 5K, FSRC 15 miler, B.A.A 5K, Cinco de Mayo half

**Goal**: 83-84 half at the end of the season

****

This week was a big one and a good one. My drive is back.

**Monday**: 8.5 miles at 8:05 pace. Feeling OK but very sore and a bit tired. Big toe pain gone. Core later.

**Tuesday**: 6.5 at 7:54 pace with strides. Felt terrible and sore before I started running, but felt good once I got out there.

**Wednesday AM**: 5 at 8:05 pace, nice and easy. Strength after.

**Wednesday PM**: Practice, 10 total with 3 x 1.75 miles with 3:00 rest in 10:55 / 10:55 / 10:53. Even for most of it, closed in a 90. Felt very good.

**Thursday**: 8.5 at 8:16 pace. Nice little leisurely jog. Unbelievably slow, but felt relaxing. Core later.

**Friday**: 7.5 at 8:05 pace. More sore and more tired today. With strides. Playing around with my breathing.

**Saturday**: Practice, 10.5 total with a 5 mile flow, 4 around 6:35 picking it up to 6:20 for the last mile. A bit faster than I was supposed to go, but it happened organically and I felt good. Strength after.

**Sunday**: 16 at 7:43 pace, 4 alone and 12 with a group. We picked it up a bit at the end so this was a little fast, but it felt good and was a solid end to the week.

****

Total 72.5. Most I've done in a while. Definitely felt it by the end of the week. PF acted up Thursday but I went to PT Friday and it's feeling good again. Big toe has been on and off. Everything kind of hurt after my long run today so I just took an ice bath.

The breathing thing. I noticed I breathe really slowly. Like if I just let it happen naturally, breathing in takes me like 4 steps and so does breathing out. I've been trying to breathe a bit more quickly, especially for hard efforts. It felt good Saturday. It'd be nice to get faster from something so simple. I think because of swimming I'm used to very long, very slow breaths, so I'm unconsciously depriving myself of oxygen when I run.

Those workouts indicate that my fitness is where it was in the middle of last season (but not quite where it was at the end). Since it's early season, I think that's a good sign. I think I can get back to where I was at the end of last season (which I think is 84 half shape) and then hopefully progress a little further.

On Tuesday I have a medical procedure to figure out these repeat ER visits. So next week will probably be 60-65, with a day off, and I might only do one workout (or two with the first one less structured and on Thursday). I'll see how I feel."

If you have decent credit, you can likely get better financing offers via the dealer than you can via your bank. It's an option to consider.

Before you buy, take the car overnight. Stick a few heavier friends in it. Make sure you can get up to highway speeds quickly (and try this with the ac on). Stick someone in the backseat and make sure you can hear them while driving -- some cars are loud.

So my answer is fake breasts because in my experience they are always more confident.  If a girl can rock her AA then by all means I am 100% fine with that as well.  I just want her to love herself.

&gt;And while the act of tooth-brushing, itself, doesn’t change, there are a few Leave No Trace considerations. To get the scoop, I asked my colleague, BP’s Southwest editor, Annette McGivney. She literally wrote the book on LNT practices. (Check it out: Leave No Trace: A Guide to the New Wilderness Etiquette, Mountaineers Books, www.moutaineersbooks.org!) 

&gt;Here’s what she says: “The art of LNT tooth-brushing is in the spray. You don't want to spit a glob of toothpaste into the bushes because animals will eat it, making themselves sick and defoliating the bush. But you don't want to swallow the toothpaste, either. So after you swish, stand at the far edge of camp and spray with all your might, spewing the spit and toothpaste over as vast an area as possible to diffuse any potential environmental impacts. (Just don’t face into the wind or you’ll get a Colgate shower!). If you floss, be sure to pack it out.”

The two things that are part of XBL are the voice and friends list but those are both things that the Wii U have. If we were talking about the Wii, I'd agree with you. The friend-code system for each game was stupid. While it allowed online play, it made the whole thing awkward. There was voice for Animal Crossing but I think that was it. The Wii U has finally fixed these things. Yes, it's about 10 years late (although in my book the Gamecube broadband adaptor was a missed opportunity) but at least give Nintendo credit where it's due. You can even video chat with friends, not something that's possible with the other systems, at least not by default.

XBL is the reason I got an Xbox in 2004, even though I was happy with my gamecube. I wasn't happy that I had to pay for it and I was less happy with the many of the people I came across but I also managed to play with some cool people too."

I just wanted to highlight this, seeing as you said this about your ideal partners family. 
&gt; As someone who comes from a small family, meeting the right person with a huge, loving family is very important to me, and also someone who will stick up for me when it’s right.

Family dynamics can be really freakin' complicated but the family should be respectful of your choice of partner unless there are *real* warning signs and your partner should stick up for you if they're not. Can you imagine trying to organize a family Christmas around all of this crap, potentially with kids in tow? Nopenopenopenope...

Finally, I am so sorry about your family death. This guy is either really emotionally immature, straight up abusive or both and he should have never treated you this way. Never, ever accept that. "

I'd change Suarez out for a ST that has more strength and can hold off defenders to get Aguero open. Negredo or Jovetic would work. Lastly I would switch Mata for a better all around midfielder. 52 strength on him and no defensive stats means he will just get bullied the entire game and not be effective for you.

AnotherSmegHead,todayilearned,1390161868.0,"It depends on the mining pool you use and the program.  I prefer cudaminer because it works well with my GTX 465 even without a lot of tweaking.  

First, go to muchreceive in your dogewallet, highlight the Dxxxxxxxxx looking address and click ""Copy Address"".  All DogeCoin addresses begin with D.  Use this in your script you are going to write.

Some pools like nonstopmine.com make you setup ""workers"" or sub-accounts if you will.  This is great for people with multiple machines like me. :D  Lets say you name your worker RIMMER and the password is SMEG

In the same folder as your mining program you make a notepad file called ""mine.bat"" It will show .txt but just add the .bat yourself.

cudaminer -o stratum+tcp://doge.nonstopmine.com:3353 -u DebianSqueez.RIMMER -p SMEG

Kind of like that.  You don't need to add the Doge address in the script, but you DO need to edit your account on the website and add it in there on that side.  You may need to manually cash out to send the coin to your wallet.

Some pools don't need this format though, like to-the-moon.info

Instead, they just calculate your processing rate all together.

cudaminer -o stratum+tcp://to-the-moon.info:9555 -u DSu1u46cLafw2RMgrhoBt8VC7HdfJsx2b3 -p x
pause 

In this case, my Doge address is in the script itself and all that coin just goes in to my wallet straight up.

Almond milk stays good for a little over two months. I came for the longer fridge life, and stayed for the extra vitamins and delicious taste.

Silk's dark chocolate almond milk is very, very delicious. I also prefer the taste of the regular ""vanilla"" almond milk over regular dairy milk, but the taste is very similar.

smaug88,aspergers,1390161918.0,"I came to some understanding about this by reading Dostoievsky. In his books, you see people not only unknowing what's best for them but also knowing it and no doing it. That's right, people often know what's best to do but act in the exact opposite way. Society is complicated because we created a massive delusion that I may call ""mythology"" or dogma. We all believe in some way in a complete lie which is the ideal us. We think we have to be what people want us to be, we want to fit in, but the only way to fit is to understand what we truly want to be. The conflict between what we think we want to be and what we truly want to be is the basis of social conflict too, because it is present in what we are as a society. I don't know if this helps with high school but, while I felt this place was hell when I was there, I understand know how funny bullies and bitches looked. They were just craving from the same acceptance than anybody else. They knew they did not have to be mean but they thought that's what was expected from them. They need help as anybody else but they will never show it. You will meet people like that your whole life but understanding that they don't act how they want to will help a lot. I could give an easy example of this: in the ""Hey Arnold"" cartoon the girl is constantly mean to Arnold when she is in fact in love with him. She acts the worst way according to her feelings and should thus be considered with pity rather than hate. Because hate is sometimes what we're looking for: we want others to punish us a way we would not by ourselves. People are complicated and it makes a complicated society."

Only slightly uncomfortable? If the genders were reversed and she the narcissistic father and you the girlfriend then that would be extremely beyond the bounds of reasonableness. If you don't appreciate it, communicate that fact clearly to her. The fact that it is ""almost always away"" is disturbing. That implies that sometimes your girlfriend is present.

Most people who hide behind a moral argument for the nonexistence of God or for justifying not believing in him are hypocrites anyway. Daring them to put themselves in God's position typically exposes the hypocrisy for what it is.

Generally my bean cooking goes like: wash/rinse the beans, stick 'em in a stock pot with 4-6 cups of water (enough to cover the beans), bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer and cover loosely, and finally just cook them until they are at the desired softness (usually 2-3 hours). They store really well in their cooking liquid in the freezer. Also, season the crap out of them, like add more seasoning than you think, and then add some more.

I'm not talking quit hardware, or publish Mario games to mobile platforms or any of that nonsense. That's long term, bullshit goals suggested by people who don't have a clue. 

What Ninty need to do is something big to get people's attention. Like release every single game they can on VC at once. Lower the price of said VC games to $1 a pop (or ~$3 for N64, say). With an epic library like they have, I think that alone would sell a few units. Then for existing customers like me, I'd snap up a shit-tonne of them.

Services are also a big downer for the console. A proper account system is a big one for literally anyone who owns *any* other device. Nintendo are pretty much the only guys that don't do this in the current space.

It's really frustrating to see them so stubborn and not keeping up with the times. I don't want them to become like Sony and M$ but they have to meet them at least half way when it comes to how to they treat players (except achievements, keep that fucking rubbish away from my WiiU). "

The substance has simply relieved your inhibitions and we all love sitting down on the couch and demolishing some nachos and cake. We all love it.

And if you get high, and you must eat, you just eat healthy. Frozen fruit is a good snack... like frozen blueberries or frozen grapes because you can snack on basically as many as you want and its just good for you. Grapes are good for your skin, blueberries are supposed to be good for your immune system.

ibbity,TheBluePill,1390162787.0,"Not as backwards as it might seem if you follow the train of thought that leads there. Men like terpers (not by any means the majority of the male population) consider themselves entitled to wield power over those they consider beneath them: women and ""beta"" men, who they consider almost as icky and worthless as feeemales in their worldview. When they see that the playing field is evening out and women and ""beta"" men are having a lot more success and empowerment than they used to, they realize that their position of top dog is slipping. 

This angers them, because they consider themselves entitled to that position, so they consider it unfair and oppressive that they aren't able to retain the status and special-ness that they (falsely) assume that they would have had in times past (it's worthwhile to note here that, although women have had less power than men have in times past, it's absolutely not true that all men ever had fists of steel to take what they wanted from women and society back in the day. Plenty of men were disenfranchised and disadvantaged back then as well. Terper beliefs wrt history are largely wishful thinking and fabrication.)

Terpers call any man who considers women people ""beta"" and ""spineless"" and ""feminized,"" so they don't look at those men as the main villains in the story because obviously they're too weak to do anything. So, the villains for the ""oppression"" of terpers are women, who then become the targets of terper revenge fantasies. You have to understand that it's really, really difficult to underestimate the sheer amount of entitlement that these guys have."

&gt;the regular rocket launcher will kill a scout in 2 hits, even if he's buft it may still kill him in 2 but this one will take 3 hits and 4 if he's buft

This is incorrect, a scout has 125 health, and 190(187.5) on overheal, the weapon does around 70 consistently which is 2 shots for a scout or 3 on overheal. Furthermore the regular rocket cant kill an overheal scout in 2 shots like you say it ""might still"" do.

I found a lot of the paleo community (one Denverite in particular) to be extremely grating and pretentious.

Honestly the scenes with Yoda in the original trilogy could easily serve as an example of something like a sage, but the jedi in the prequels and most subsequent media have had more of a rigid and moralistic code than I think a sage would have.  For a sage, things like that aren't written in stone, they're spontaneous; the right action is taken at the right time and will simply happen.  Certainly the push and pull of the force is a good metaphor for the Tao itself, and especially the idea of the Force as an inherent aspect of creation, that very much mirrors the Tao.

However, Jedi knights strike me as being more along the lines of Buddhist monks of a certain flavor rather than specifically Taoist.  It's not a 1:1 ratio, but there are some good ideas in Jedism that certainly seem Tao-inspired."

Mech, L. David. 1999. ""Alpha status, dominance, and division of labor in wolf packs"". Canadian Journal of Zoology 77:1196–1203.

I believe it is slightly different in primates, but it has also been shown that the dropoff between so called ""alpha"" ""beta"" and ""gamma"" members insofar as sexual reproduction is concerned is much less steep than previously theorized.

&gt;**Zinc inhibits replication of the virus** and has been tested in trials for treatment of the common cold. This review identified 18 randomised controlled trials, enrolling 1781 participants of all age groups, comparing zinc with placebo (no zinc). We found that zinc (lozenges or syrup) reduces the average duration of the common cold in healthy people, when taken within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. In people taking zinc their cold symptoms are also less likely to persist beyond seven days of treatment. Prophylactic zinc supplementation for at least five months reduces incidence, school absences and prescription of antibiotics for children with the common cold, - See more at: http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD001364/zinc-for-the-common-cold#sthash.a00o5i09.dpuf

&gt;A 2012 systematic review suggested that ""zinc formulations may shorten the duration of symptoms of the common cold"", but that further research was needed and that possible adverse effects needed to be studied.[10]

&gt; In laboratory studies, zinc inhibited the replication of respiratory viruses and enhanced the effect of interferon.[5] Non-immune mechanisms have also been proposed to explain the effect of zinc lozenges on the common cold.[5][12][13]

WraithPDX,worldnews,1390163331.0,"Ok, I'm going to offer my opinion on this because I have a completely different account.

Where I work we have a small group of Russians. They have been working for the company for 10+ years. They don't speak a shred of English. They live in a community that is primarily composed of other Russian immigrants, so there is no chance for integration or assimilation. They stay entirely within their own comfort zones.

They don't speak English so they can't understand the directions they have to follow. Their inability to follow simple instructions is causing repeat problems every single week that I'm having to do more work to cover for, and it's not even my job to do so. Efforts were made by my boss to offer English lessons and tutoring for them for free, nobody wanted to take it. So they sit there, huddled together, talking in Russian all day and screwing up something because the documents we receive are almost 99% English, with a random German one being thrown into the mix now and then.

I'm sympathetic to those in your case, but there are many, many immigrants that are like I described above. Content to exist in their own little communities where they are comfortable while still taking advantage of the perks of living in the US."

Powers

Cyclops is a mutant.

Optic Blast: Cyclops possesses the mutant ability to project a powerful beam of concussive, ruby-colored force from his eyes. Cyclops's powers were originally believed to be ambient energies (such as solar radiation, photons, and cosmic rays) absorbed and metabolized by his body into concussive blasts that are released from his eyes. However, the energy supply of his optic blasts are later revealed to originate from a non-Einsteinian universe that opens up whenever he uses his optic blasts.

Cyclops's eyes not only are organs that utilizes the visible spectrum of light to see the world around it. They are also inter-dimensional portals between this universe and a non-Einsteinian universe where physical laws as we know them do not pertain. This non-Einsteinian universe is filled with particles that resemble photons, yet they interact with this universe's particles by transferring kinetic energy in the form of gravitons (the particle of gravitation). These particles generate great, directional concussive force when they interact with the objects of this universe.

Cyclops's mind has a particular psionic field that is attuned to the forces that maintain the apertures that have taken the place of his eyes. Because his mind's psionic field envelops his body, it automatically shunts the other-dimensional particles back into their point of origin when they collide with his body. Thus, his body is protected from the effects of the particles, and even the thin membrane of his eyelids is sufficient to block the emission of energy. The synthetic ruby quartz crystal used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops's eyeglasses and visor is resonant to his minds' psionic field and is similarly protected. "

IntellegentIdiot,worldnews,1390163421.0,"&gt;“The principle is a good one but it needs to be introduced in a way that’s fair and reasonable.

“If it is, it will meet with general public approval. The ability to speak English is one of the most empowering tools in the labour market and we should be encouraging as many people as possible to learn it.”

Well said, Liam Fox. 

I'm all for immigrants learning the language of their adoptive country but I also believe in leading by example. Our track record on speaking foreign languages is appalling and we have a very arrogant attitude when it comes to it. We can't attack immigrants for not learning English when we're just as bad, if not worse, when we're abroad.

If the government wanted to start an initiative to encourage, or even force, immigrants to be proficient English speakers that'd be great. English proficiency should be a requirement of citizenship. However, this suggestion smacks of attempt to appease the anti-immigrant brigade.

If someone pays tax in this country, don't they deserve to be catered to? If we axe all the translators, aren't we just going to have another group of unemployed people? If the government is going to pay either way, they might as well be useful"

After a few times you see life a little differently, y'know? And it was an peaceful feeling--after the mental sickening snap of a paradigm shifting without a clutch in my head. I realized a lot of unpleasant personal things about myself, things that had been simmering in the back of my mind for a couple of months. So that was pretty awful, but afterwards? Just sitting there. Waiting. At peace. Wondering if it would hurt. Wondering how long before they found the body. Would they even find it.

I remember when everyone played Marth and then everyone switched to C.Fal and then to fox and then Falco and back to fox. I remember the  brief surge of peach players and jiggly players.

ibbity,TheBluePill,1390163590.0,"The biggest problem I have with MRAs is that there actually *are* issues that men face in the modern world that *do* need to be taken care of. The question of ""What is a good and true masculine identity and role in a post-feminist world?"" is a valid one and needs to be answered. Men who are caught between archaic ideas of ""what makes a man"" and modern ideas of ""be what you want and just go with the flow, dude"" really do struggle to figure out what manhood means in the 21st century, and it's a lot harder in a lot of places for men to step outside of gender roles than it is for women. 

It's also true that male victims of rape or abuse have a harder time being taken seriously than do female victims (which considering how hard it can be for said female victims is really saying something.) It's true that a lot less men get custody of their children than women do, because a lot of men don't know that they can sue for joint custody and win it. It's true that men don't have as many BC options as women do. It's true that people seem far less interested and invested in breaking down and opening up the traditional masculine role than they do the traditional feminine role. These are *valid concerns,* and I think it's really true that they don't get the attention they deserve most of the time.

But. MRAs DO NOT HELP WITH THESE ISSUES FOR THE MOST PART. What they mostly seem to do is complain about the fact that WOMEN have been able to achieve a partial breakdown and an opening of the traditional feminine role, that women can do things that were traditionally reserved to men with less flack than men can doing feminine things, that women have more options and rights than they once did. They seem way more interested in defeating the things that women have achieved than in achieving similar things for men. Some of them are very aggressive and vitriolic in their anti-woman sentiments. You don't see so much ""Men need help in this area, how can we get society to see that this thing is a problem?"" from them as you do ""Men need help in this area and IT IS ALL THE FAULT OF WOMEN, WOMEN ARE BAD AND OBVIOUSLY HATE MEN!"" It's like they looked at the more extreme of the Second Wave feminists and thought, ""Yes, good, this is just the model on which we will build our own movement!""

Tl;dr the MRAs actually take men backwards wrt gender equality because they spend way more time complaining about women's advancement than trying to advance men, and the angry misogyny that many of the more outspoken MRAs display actually turns people off the idea of trying to help with men's issues."

frackaracka,asianamerican,1390163605.0,"Okay, I see where you're coming from, but I'm still not entirely convinced. I do see a difference in M.I.A.'s NYLON cover and the GQ photoshoot. She does look a little ""grayed"" out. 

But, I don't know if it's intentional white-washing so much as just an exposure effect. Look at these images of Zooey Deschanel for [Marie Claire](http://www.olivecocomag.com/wp-content/uploads/MC12.jpg) and [Allure](http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/zooey-deschanel-allure-magazine-february-2012-cover__oPt.jpg) magazines. ZD looks distinctly pinker in the Allure cover, but her skin takes on a more cool color tone in the Marie Claire cover.

Given that M.I.A.'s brownness is still intact in the previous NYLON cover that /u/msing linked to, even if they did want to white-wash her I don't understand the inconsistency between the two covers - why would they white-wash one and not the other? I just don't think this was a case of racist white-washing so much as filter/lighting experiment to give the cover a different effect.

EDIT: I forgot to address the before/after picture that the Aerogram posted. There's a graphic designer commenting on the original tweet that points out that the image on the right is very brightly lit, but the image on the left had been badly altered to be underexposed - not just M.I.A., but the magazine cover as a whole. In other words, someone may have altered the original image, which was the overexposed cover."

There are multiple milk ducts within the breast and nipple, so even if some get blocked, there's usually a route for it to drain.

It's suggested that you remove the piercing while breastfeeding for a few reasons.  
It makes it easier for the baby to nurse if there's nothing else in the way.  
Removing it prevents the piercing from becoming undone and being swallowed or chocked on by the child.  
When breastfeeding, the nipples can get chaffed, swollen, sore. Having a piercing at the same time just makes things much more uncomfortable."

When I brought up ""*believing*"" the experiences of individual athletes, I didn't mean to imply that you disbelieve them. I was trying to say that my point isn't something that I think should be used to directly shape laws or policy (you can't base those on anecdata, since of course it's possible for people to be dishonest about their experiences), but is more of a best practice for personal interactions. Society itself is racist, society itself is sexist, and I am a part of society, so when my first reaction to somebody's story is ""Seriously? Are you sure you're not just being hypersensitive and making a big deal out of nothing?"" I try to rethink my reaction in that context and remind myself that our society is structured to downplay the concerns of minorities and give a break to members of a majority group.

Rolten,cigars,1390163914.0,""" including a prohibition on smoking in places of employment, bars, restaurants, and many outdoor areas. ""

Seems like a good thing. This will reduce the amount of tobacco products people are exposed to. I for one did not enjoy smelling like cigarette smoke when I used to come home from the pub (in the Netherlands we've already banned smoking inside, except for special smoking rooms). Children will see less people smoking cigarettes. Smoking is further discouraged by making it less convenient for people. This will also make life a lot better for the employees of pubs and restaurants.


""S.B. 168 contains exemptions for tobacco manufacturers, cigar bars, and tobacco retail shops.""

Brilliant.

Some will (incorrectly) claim it's a game or engine difference, but when you get to 60, 90, or 120FPS in Battlefield, it's very smooth and makes a **huge** difference in your ability to win firefights. On top of this, very, very, very few games can maintain a consistent framerate. Thus, if the goal of the developers is 30, you'll sometimes see dips into the 20's or teens. That's very choppy territory. 

On the other hand, at 60 FPS, you have a margin that you can work with. You might see dips to the 50's, which is unnoticeable, or even 45, which is slightly noticeable, but you'll still be very playable. 

So, you get better, smoother games, more precision, and a larger overhead for any inevitable FPS slips that occur regardless of the goal FPS. "

Turf roofing makes really good insulation and tends to last for quite a while without a ton of maintenance.  You can still find houses with roofs like that in areas of the US where Northern Europeans settled, including out on the plains, although most really traditional structures like that aren't actively used as dwellings anymore.

By building structures partially or completely covered in dirt with plants growing on it (to hold the dirt in place), you tap into the really good insulative properties of soil, which tends to keep the structure warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer without having to expend as much  energy for climate control.  Also, if space is a concern and you build the building right, you can use the same area you live in as a growing space and reduce your amount of personal sprawl.

Laozen,taoism,1390164332.0,"There is fundamentally nothing to satisfy; there are no conditions which must be met in order to be whole and complete.  *You are the Tao!*  You ***are*** that which you seek!

But you are beyond the ego, that I absolutely guarantee you.  Your ego is a part of the Tao as well, that is true, but it is an illusion.  Let me make that distinction clear: It is real, but it is not the full you, in the same way that a mask is quite real but it is not the 'true' face of the one who wears it, and in the same way, your ego is like a whirlpool in a stream, it spins and whirls and is in and of itself a whirlpool, but it is also the water in the stream doing that.  Or as a wave in an ocean, it is its own wave, but it is not separate in any true sense from the ocean.

So too is the ego; it's an idea of a self distinct from the rest of creation but that's not really who you are, not deep down.  You are the cosmic self, you *are* the Tao.  Let me ask you, where is your self?  It isn't the limits of the body because those change, and certainly it isn't the atoms or molecules in your body, since only a third of yours actually belong to you, and you breathe and eat, which means you take in and put out things, you are this constant pulse of activity, you're not static, so... where's the self?

I'll digress from this for a moment to address your points.  You ask what would be wrong with indulging the ego in seeking philosophical pleasure.  There's nothing wrong with the ego seeking philosophical pleasure.  In fact pleasure-seeking in and of itself isn't *wrong* in the sense of ""Oh, you must never do these things!""  Nothing so simplistically prescriptive is correct, no.  But you should keep in mind that indulgence of the ego is a temporary thing and not wholly fulfilling in the deepest sense.  However, you are already in the deepest sense wholly fulfilled, so in that sense *there is no thing to satisfy at all!*

The pursuit of spiritual enlightenment is in fact an interesting but in its own way misguided enterprise, because it suggests that you are somehow not all there, or that something is missing from your life, when the very idea of 'missing' or 'incomplete' are simply illusory half-views of a completed whole that is already inherent in everything.  When you realize that you've already arrived at where you're trying to get, then you can realize that indulging the ego is but the barest minor side note in an eternity of complete whole being, either as this ego which you play the role of, or as any of the countless other things which you, the Tao, are already.

tl;dr -- The ego is not the whole self, the ego is an aspect of the self.  Therefore, you are an aspect of the complete Self which may be called the Tao or Brahman or God or whatever you want, but the point is, there's nothing really to satisfy that isn't already satisfied.  So go ahead and read philosophy, indulge your ego to a reasonable degree keeping moderation and common sense in mind as to how to go about it (that's not a commandment, that's simply for your own good, your own pleasure even), and relax--you're fulfilled already.  You were never not fulfilled at your core."

Escaides,OkCupid,1390164392.0,"Still no date stories to tell this week. I'm having a few half-hearted conversations with some cute boys but can't seem to motivate myself to take it any further. Just feeling rather apathetic towards the process right now, and I know I should be focusing on other things anyways.

I cleared up some bad blood between me and an old friend this week. I never had any friends during my formative years (long story) and he's one of the people I latched onto when I turned 18 and finally started meeting people. I promptly developed an intense crush on him (he has a longterm girlfriend, now fiancee) which I nursed for two years before we cut contact and now that we're back in touch we are just now beginning to figure out how to deal with the resulting weirdness and be close friends again. I have a fierce loyalty towards people I consider good friends and trust; once it was part of my naive, idealistic nature, but now after spending some time in the world, it's because I've realized just how rare people worth trusting completely are. To me, a good friend is forever, and it broke me a little bit not being able to talk to him.

So, we had a friend-date on Friday. Friend dates are great; I'm beginning to find that time well-spent in good company is just as rewarding as a romantic evening, even without the potential for banging. He gave me a driving lesson in his shitty Festiva, I took him for Vietnamese as thanks, ran some errands, then hung out with him and another longtime friend at the local university campus for a meeting of the Super Smash Bros club, during which I enjoyed some delicious poutine and watched some hardcore nerds kick the shit out of each other. I paused for several drinks at the campus bar (which was just right around the corner) but found it curiously dead for a Friday night. Talked with my other friend for a bit, and once I'd had my fill of ambient nerdom, made my way home on the train.

In the past couple months, I've gone from being alone and utterly friendless to having people in my life who are clever and interesting, who will spend time with me, who I'm beginning to trust will be there for me when I need them. Still single, but good friends are more valuable to me than any spring fling."

My current routine is washing with Neutrogena's clear acne bar and the Clarisonic Mia, moisturizing with CeraVe (CeraVe I only use in winter because it's dry as hell here, other seasons only need Clinique's dramatically different moisturizing gel) and using Epiduo as a spot treatment. I'm considering trying an oil mask, /r/skincareaddiction is buzzing about them at the moment. Primer is E.L.F. poreless face primer (one of the very few E.L.F. skincare products I'm happy with) which has my one and only weakness, tea tree oil. Concealer is E.LF.'s zit zapping concealer in green, which I don't like because it's too thick and too opaque. I think it's meant to be used with liquid foundation and not covered with powder the way I do it. Foundation is Clinique's stay matte pressed powder in 03 stay beige (although I bought it last summer when I had a tan)

So basically my skincare routine involves a lot of trial and error."

dakru,MensRights,1390164452.0,"&gt; I am a firm believer that for anything to get done MRAs and Feminists need to work together, because they should be working toward a common goal.

I think a lot of the people who want feminists and MRAs to work together are naive.

This isn't coming from some childishly simplistic ""because they're bad people who hate men and we're good people who just want equality"" but instead from a more reasonable understanding of the fact that feminist theory has a lot of core ideas (like the idea we live in a patriarchy, that women are oppressed, that sexism against men is impossible, etc.) that most MRAs are (for good reason, in my personal opinion) unwilling to accept.

We simply view society and gender issues so differently that working together is impractical. If we can bridge some gap in this (which would include both sides making concessions) *then* we might be able to work together."

Yes, they increase common wear and tear...that's more a driving fast thing, though. So it's really the attitude of someone that equips a turbocharger and this decal, right? Well, let's actually look at this squarely. He installed a turbocharger, right? So we can assume one of three things: he's rich and/or it was a gift, he knows enough to install it himself or he really, really wanted a turbocharger. If he put it there himself, can we give him the benefit of the doubt and say since he *knew* what he's doing with that car, it's better maintained than your wife's vagina? Ok, really wanted (had a shop put it in) one. Well, he cares about the car, then. Sure, he could've hot rodded it - no, he *did* hot rod it, in all three cases, likely, but again, you know you're buying a car with a turbo, you will, too. Ok, the first one, he's a rich kid or it was a gift. Well, if it was a gift, so why is he selling it? Not really all that likely unless he made his own way...so he's responsible. Ok, rich kid. If that is the case, no, don't buy it. In fact, don't buy used goods from rich kids....they don't value their shit.

So all in all what we found out in my statement is that if a dude were to ever suck my Penis I would be gay. Oh dear Lord I would be uber gay. But since I cannot get off being blown by another dude because I would not even get up and would physically feel ill I kinda thought that this guy would be too (again projecting my feelings and mindset wrongfully onto his situation he had going there).

DivineVodka,ShingekiNoKyojin,1390164766.0,"Honestly it doesn't matter whether you agree to it or not.  The question was why I like him and I answered.  That is something I like.  

I think Eren's character is far from what it should be.  The only thing that made sense to me was how he processed Hannes death.  He just accepted it and said he will avenge him.  Someone who has been through tragedy that is how one would normally react not fall over and curl up in the fetal position and cry.  I appreciate that and it shows Eren growing, however this crying thing and somehow so in touch with his emotions of the world despite his tragedies just makes the character look fake to me.

You seem to have problems with Levi.  I leave that to you good sir, I answered why I like Levi and I LOVE that he has been through tragedies and it shows.  The only time you can know Eren has been through anything is when he's in battle or about to go in it.  (When he bit the Titan's neck because of it killing Thomas earlier that was fucking epic to me).  Overall Eren's character is flawed that's my opinion which is of no importance to anyone.  It's the authors story so whatever he decides I am fine with.  Eren's crying and this weird worry for people is just odd to me.

Take for example.  How he treated the Annie situation, it's just unbelievable how he reacted.  It makes sense to us the readers but not in the world he's in.  Armin, Mikasa whoever else who was apart of the plan was completely level headed and didn't bring their emotions into it.  One can argue they had more time to do it but it just looks to me like most of the people from 104 are growing up and Eren is struggling to change his habits of having good humanity.  Which is something Armin touched on about throwing away that humanity.  This world you will die as the weak, the person who struggles to make harsh decisions.  

Eren who has been through so much IMO should not react to situations as he does.

I love Levi for that because it makes sense.  In his backstory we see his old teammates one could expect they died and if they died it must had been hard for him which would explain why he reacted to his squads death.  Whenever someone from Eren's squad dies again I can assure you he will stop and break down and cry.  It just doesn't correlate with this world imho, that humanity that he's holding so desperately onto is annoying to me.  In that world there is no such thing as humane thinking if you need to survive thank god for Erwin's character.

Great author imho if he makes a character that is loved so much by me as well as hated so much a person would call a character a douche.  Truly fascinating."

PatHeist,science,1390164802.0,"Yeah. It's a lot easier to imagine why someone would suffer from PTSD after coming home from war, because most people are so disconnected from what happens in those situations. PTSD, depression and other reactive mental disorders don't work on a basis of what one would imagine to be more traumatic, though. There is a correlation, but in no way are they fixed. 

Michael Holmes survived a fall from 12,000 feet with a broken ankle and a punctured lung, yet there are others who trip over at ground level and who end up breaking their leg. It happens all the time. Falling from a standing position and hitting your head on flat ground can be deadly, too. And it is something that's happened so much that humans have developed physiological responses to prevent it. And just like with physical injuries, mental 'injuries' can be sustained to disproportionate levels from events that you wouldn't think that bad. It's all about how the person experiences the event and how equipped they are to deal with it in the moment."
SOSBTK,changemyview,1390164802.0,"By inappropriate I mean acting either illegally or using their authority for personal reasons. 

And yes, at times the job does involve them getting physical in order to carry out their duties but how physical should it have to be? While police do have the right to protect themselves and others there is a limit to how far that goes. For me, the idea of a 'higher standard' means harsher legal punishments for crimes committed by police officers while on duty and a more efficient way of charging said police officers. For example there was a case not too long ago about two police officers who would pull people over and rob them. In this case they were using their authority meant to pull over those breaking the law in order to do so themselves. The point of a harsher punishment would be to both curb that behavior and to teach the offenders and others that said actions will not be tolerated. 

I think of it in the same context as it being illegal to impersonate a police officer. Those who are arrested for doing so weren't doing it to collect a pension, they were doing it because police are given more power than the average citizen to enforce and uphold the law. If someone who is legally a police officer uses that authority to commit a crime then that crime is being committed in the same way as a crime by one impersonating a police officer. 

On a side note, I'm curious about your opinion on the police wearing cameras on their person while on duty. This has been done and the departments involved have found a sharp decline in complaints since implementing it."

She was made by a master doll-maker at the end of the C19th and came with my family when they moved from Argentina in 1947. She's a jointed doll, and the string that keeps her limbs attached has loosened over the years so she 'slips' out of position. We used to sit her in a doll rocking chair in a glas display cabinet and one of my friends absolutely hated her. The weird/creepy thing about her is that whenever this one friend was around, Chikeeta would 'slip' so she looked directly at her. There was always a rational explanation for the movement - wobbly floor boards, someone knocked the cabinet, gust of wind whatever - but it was mildly worrying that she would always slip (which was uncommon otherwise) when this one friend was around, and the doll would slip in such a way that she looked directly at this friend."

You watch kinky porn but would never hurt and abuse your SO? Apply the same logic here and get over it. This doesn't mean he's bi.

Oh and also, I suspect there's an element of the forbidden fruit at play here. When straight people engage in homosexual acts, or vice versa, I'd bet that 9 times out of 10, part of what turns them on is the very fact that it's not their idea of who they are.

Serae,AskReddit,1390165083.0,"My mother was a dominatrix professionally for many years.  Sex therapist by day and domina by night.  So maybe this is something similar?

I did most of the chores in the house except laundry.  I was not allowed in the basement for any reason.  Of course that means I snuck down...  Our basement was a dungeon.  Poles, straps, things to stradle, walls of toys and tools...and the smell of incense and something else I didn't know at the time.  

Sometimes my mother had clients when I would normally be home (she usually didn't).  We had a code.  I would check the mail box.  If there was an envelope with my name on it, it meant that it contained money and a time for me to return. I would take the money and go down the street to a bookshop where I would order a wrap and do my homework in their cafe.  At the time I didn't mind, but as I got older I realized it wasn't really the best thing for me and that it wasn't a safe solution.

A few times she forgot to leave me an envelope and I walked into...sounds coming from the basement.  Sometimes it wasn't a client but rather just someone she wanted to bone.  I have seen my mother bent over various pieces of furniture in our living room unfortunately when it just came to a walking into her general sex life.  She's also answered the door when I came home to see her in a harness or in her gear.  I saw her naked often and she wasn't shy about it. :/

I didn't know what she did was weird, but only that I wasn't meant to talk about it.  Sometimes my afternoons were spend having a snack in a bookstore cafe and sometimes I was able to come right home when I got off the bus.  I don't know if it was entirely about money or if it was just something she loved doing.  My mother was more down to earth with sex related things for a parent.  She was very difficult in most other area of our life.

I didn't look down on her for doing this though.  My relationship with my mother is complicated, but it is due to a number of other unrelated factors.

At this point start increasing the volume so you're listening to music at a normal level, and consider putting the music on repeat.  Don't do this with music you like, otherwise you'll never be able to listen to those songs again without almost passing out.

Omega037,relationship_advice,1390165181.0,"I got married a couple years ago and we had to pay for it ourselves, so we did it for relatively cheap.

First thing is the venue.  Some places can charge thousands just as a base amount and then cost $75 or $100 per plate.  That is before you even get to addons like an open bar and the costs of setup and linens.

However, it doesn't have to be this way.  By going about 40 minutes out of our small city and into a more rural area, we found a nice venue in a small town that charged nothing for the space and only $25 per plate (after tax).  They had a deck that had a gazebo for this kind of ceremony that worked perfectly.

This was a town that didn't even have a traffic light, and the venue was basically a restaurant with a large banquet hall where they held things like Chamber of Commerce meetings and other local events.

Second thing is to see what you can get done for cheap or free through your friends and family.  My officiant was a family friend of my mother who was a judge.  The photographs were done by a friend and a brother of a friend who had SLR cameras.  There was a nearby park that we went to for these pictures, and then returned to the venue.  The ceremony music was done by a friend of my wife who was a cellist.  These things could have easily cost us thousands of dollars, but they were free instead (besides the cellist's partner who cost us $100).

For the music during the reception, my best man had a good set of concert hall speakers and we just connected my wife's laptop to them with an mp3 playlist.  For decorations, we got flowers at a local grocery store (Wegmans) and various other things like vases at an arts and crafts store (Michaels).

The dress was from a discount bridal shop, the suit was one I already owned (fortunately, I had a green summer suit), and there were no bridesmaids, only a best man and a maid of honor.

We the cheap cost of everything, we actually made money on the wedding in gifts (my parents friends would sometimes give $50, $100, or even $200).  We kept it to about 100 people and the weather was very nice to us.

Please feel free to PM me if you want more advice or particulars.  Also, we managed to have an amazing honeymoon on the cheap as well, so I can give good advice on that too.

I think the overall key though is to spend money where it is most effective and adds the most value.  The difference between $50 a table for decorations and $500 a table is generally not worth close to the huge increase in cost.  Besides, how much should you really care about how spectacular the tables look."

The cards are going to be about font 5 to fit them all in, so anyone without fighter pilot vision is going to find it a strain at best. The 'series of gongs' are a nice touch, just in case anyone isn't feeling like a complete tool while playing.

You can play poker on a phone tablet device for real or play money, with people all over the world. The pokerstars software works beautifully, even Yanks can play play money so this is literally of no value to anyone ever.

Finally, the absurd cost of $200K+ means that this is just a giant advert reading: 'mega-whale'. No-one who seriously played poker would buy this, so it automatically highlights that the owner is both rich and knows nothing of poker. I can only look forward to seeing it on Dan Blizerian's wrist this Spring.

Hopefully, he's the kind of man who can take what you say and use it to reevaluate how he's been treating you.  Hopefully he's also the kind of man who can explain himself well.

My guess?  This is his way of trying to share something with you he *loves* and which he sees the capacity for you to love, too.  I'm not saying what he's done is right, but what I see is some honest mistakes.

But to say he never considers his actions or the impact they have on other people is a disservice to all the attempts that have been made to characterize him over the years.  
  
Particularly with the Craig movies, they seem to have taken special care to create a character that values the lives of his comrades, and even Sean Connery got pissed off when a girl was killed.  
  
How can you analyze a character that's been written for 50 years by hundreds if not thousands of people in 2 minutes?
  
Just because he kills people and doesn't feel bad about it doesn't mean he's a psychopath.  It's part of the job, ever watch an interview with a sniper who has more than 10 confirmed kills?  They do it because they have to or more people will suffer and die.  There's no room for regret or remorse because lives are at stake.  
  
This is doubly true in a James Bond movie where the world is usually at stake.

At most, I'd say he's an asshole."

Misanthropy-Divine,Bass,1390165407.0,"Phyrgian and Phrygian dominant modes, Locrian and Superlocrian, the natural and harmonic (and maybe melodic, for jazzier moments) minor scales, Hungarian minor scale, your blues scales, and of course, the chromatic scale. Also make sure you get comfortable with augmented, diminished, and suspended chords -- how they work, when to use them, etc.

The important thing to keep in mind with progressive metal isn't so much the scales that are used, as a lot of it anymore tends to lean towards atonality, so much the notes, chords, and progressions that are used. That might sound odd, but as you foray further into the world of progressive music, you'll notice that there's a movement away from scales as they're traditionally used towards experimenting with the intervals and spacing between chords within a progression, as well as with the chords themselves, even if they use the same root. The role of the bass, then, is transforming with it slightly, so that now (in my opinion) its job becomes highlighting the chords that are being used, rather than just sticking to the roots constantly."

coralshroom,TwoXChromosomes,1390165554.0,"i had similar treatment from a guy i dated very briefly, but ultimately it didn't work out due to geographical/compatibility issues. 

from my perspective, it boiled down to him constructing a persona for me before we had even spoken to each other, based on some physical traits, example: i wear massive glasses because i have awful vision and large frames suit my face. from that, he had this idea that i was this super nerdy girl that he could indulge in all his stereotypical 'nerd' pastimes like video games, sci fi movies + tv. 

what i told him i do: when i am not working a day job, i am working at my art practice, writing proposals, volunteering at galleries, or attending workshops/openings and trying to make friends/contacts in the art community. i play some sports too, and at the end of that day, that doesn't leave time for much else besides eating and dicking around on the internet.

what he thought i was interested in though, i told him otherwise and nothing i said indicated i did this: play video games, watch tonnes of movies, watch tonnes of tv.

i think he was so hung up on me being his nerd fantasy girl that he literally did not register anything i told him. like we were hanging out, deciding what to watch on netflix, and i was like, 'oh i've heard good things about orange is the new black and i haven't had a chance to see it yet, why don't we watch the first one.' him: 'oh come on. let's watch something we know is going to be good &lt;offers choice between two movies he wanted to watch based on comic books i am not familiar with so i'll be totally lost with all the characters, vetos all my other suggestions of things i am interested in watching that have more universal appeal&gt;' i just pick one of his movies to get it over with, and he's like, 'this is awesome, girls are never interested in watching this sort of thing.' and it's like, 'uhh, i'm not really, but you didn't want to see anything else.'

personally, what i found problematic was that he put primacy on his idea of who i was, over actually listening to me and realizing i'm a real person with my own ideas and motivations and not the one-dimensional nerd fantasy girl (i'm a woman dammit!) he had created in his head. 

i guess what it boils down to in both our cases is whether the guy can throw away the preconceived notions or not. i'd bring up that it makes you uncomfortable that he's put such an emphasis on the 'nerd queen' that he's overlooking other aspects of your life that are more important to you, like your dance career. from how the guy in my situation responded when i gently suggested i wasn't interested in the things he thought i was interested in, i decided it wasn't worth pursuing a relationship."

The nature of the web, and how close it is to their face makes it all but invisible from their side, but from a distance it becomes very difficult to distinguish faces underneath it. For civilian-related duty where special forces are involved, this is very important in keeping the identity of the officers concealed. In order to prevent blackmail, bribery or hostage situations. The angle of the webbing coming off their helmets also makes them less distinguishable as 'human figures' to snipers and other people when out in the woods. And that's an extremely important part of modern camouflage, seeing as the majority of 'target identification' for a sniper is based on 'human figures' rather than things like faces, skin tones or even weapons. Being able to identify what would to most people look like a tree or rock as a human based on shape, location and size isn't uncommon - and altering the 'default' human shape makes this more difficult. Beyond that, it is useful for traversing water and swimming, as it prevents foreign objects from getting into the mouth and nose area, like leaves and small branches. The webbing is also helps when trying to 'adorn' yourself with locally found objects for camouflage purposes.

My guess is that they're mostly using it for the purpose of keeping things out of their face and concealing their identity in the above photo, though. As it looks like some form of training exercise or press demo."

frackaracka,ABCDesis,1390165870.0,"I'm in a mood to nit-pick today:

&gt;It's another matter that the American bureaucracy can be as dreadful. As someone pointed out, an Indian will jump through the hoops and wait for hours in front of the US embassy for a visa; but the same Indian, or Indian-American, will find a similar process at an Indian mission intolerable. 

""Someone""? Someone said this? Who? Is there a reason this person is anonymous? If so, why not attribute the reason for the anonymity? Or does this person even exist in the first place? And what might be the reasons that an Indian would tolerate a line in front of the US embassy versus the Indian embassy? Perhaps the relative ease of cutting through the red tape with bribes at the Indian embassy has something to do with shorter patience for standing in lines?

For a journalistic piece, this is kind of a terrible oversight. On the other hand, it does a decent job of explaining the different socio-cultural value systems that Americans and Indians have regarding the Help. It did seem like the author was painting an overly-rosy picture of the relationship between Indians and their servants, as well as trying to place the blame on Americans for the incident. (""It is universally recognized that Americans are quick to seek immunity and privileges, but reluctant to grant it. That time has now ended. At least in India."")

It's going to take a long time for Indians to get over the ""everyone other than my friends and family is *kachra*"" mentality."

Life-in-Death,AdviceAnimals,1390165975.0,"&gt;An animal science major once dominated by men is now 83 percent women. Women hold slight majorities in chemistry, as well as the biochemistry and molecular biology major, and represent 61 percent of one of UC Davis’ most popular majors, biological sciences.




&gt;It was in 1979 that women overtook men in undergraduate enrollment. Women held a slim majority until the mid-1990s, when their numbers began to rise faster than men’s. Throughout the past decade, the ratio has hovered near 55–45 percent. Women still trail men slightly among the more than 4,000 graduate students, but **hold majorities in many of the professional schools such as law, medicine and veterinary medicine.**




&gt;“The percentages I’m seeing are more like 60:40 female to male in the undergraduate pools,” said Kimsey, the entomology chair. “In **graduate pools in science it’s a little closer to 50:50,** but then when you go to **recruitment for faculty positions it often drops to 10:90 female to male.”**

But if you look at the game lineup Nintendo is going for with the Wii U and 3DS, they are clearly focussing on a much bigger core experience than the casual ""play and go"" nature of the mobile platforms. Is mobile eating into their share? Possibly. The numbers show that that may be true to some extent with the 3DS (though it's doing no worse than the GBA did in it's time).

brotherbock,philosophy,1390166495.0,"It's simply the veil of perception problem. I cannot, no matter how hard I try, get past the limitations of my visual field/spectrum, limitations on hearing, touch, and the like. I can 'see' UV rays, for example, but only after a machine has *translated* UV rays into the visible spectrum. So how do I confirm that what the UV translating machine has done is actually translate UV rays? Well, I can appeal to another machine, a machine that I *think* detects UV rays...and the output of those machines can cohere. But that's still not getting to the UV rays themselves.

The subatomic world is another example--atomic theory is simply a good story of how things we cannot see go about their business. And when a machine beeps (in the audible spectrum) and flashes a light (in the visible spectrum), we can say ""Ah, it has just detected such and such particles"". But this is a claim that can only be verified by other, similarly limited, instances of research.

Thus, science is merely coherence of claims. The best 'story' wins, so to speak. And this is the heart of subjectivity--science can only ever be the result of our subjective view of the world, and we must acknowledge that there are ways of experiencing the world, facts about the world, that we can never know."

I find it very helpful to personify my alcoholism. He will say anything he can to get me to drink, but I know from hard experience that he is a lying bastard. He can not be trusted. 

The good news is that he only has a voice, he does not have hands or feet or a mouth or a wallet. He needs all those things to get any alcohol, and he can no longer use mine. 

It is an ongoing decision not to drink, no matter what. I make that decision every day, and you need to as well. It gets easier to keep making that decision the longer you go, you just get in the habit of telling that liar to shut up. 

One of the great things about NYC living for an alcoholic is that you can find an AA meeting every day of the week, almost around the clock. [This interactive meeting finder](http://www.nyintergroup.org/meetinglist/) is really helpful.

Guglio08,PS4,1390166679.0,"The Phantom Pain is a huge game. The red band trailer points to it being enormous in size. However, it takes place 9 years after the events of Ground Zeroes, which itself is a sequel to Peace Walker.

Therefore, Ground Zeroes is the transition game between Peace Walker and The Phantom Pain. The leaked achievement list for Ground Zeroes also shows a similarity with Peace Walker - you can beat the story very quickly, but there's side missions that lengthen it out. 

I suspect that it's going to be a pretty good game at $20 - $30, and that it will surely whet the appetite of any MGS fan for the main course."

Mosinista,Finland,1390166683.0,"I'm a teacher in southern Finland. The statements in the article you linked to are oversimplifications at best, some are just untrue. I'm on mobile at the moment (school issued iPad) so I won't copy-paste all the false ones, but here are some general comments regarding this, and other US articles on Finnish education I've read.

Teachers are well respected but nowhere as well paid as physicians, doctors etc. The highest paid K12 teachers are paid more than entry level doctors in public health care, but that's about it.

We certainly assign homework and administer tests to lower grades. These are, of course, appropriate in form and difficulty to the age group but there's no absence of tests like often mentioned in US articles. Nationally standardized tests are given at class 9, ie 15-16 year olds at the last class of lower secondary AND at the matriculation exam at class 12, ie 18-19 yo.

We have compulsory education but not compulsory schooling (like in Sweden), ie home schooling is possible. Private schools do exist but are few and far between (I've worked in one). 

The claim that Finnish teachers spend only 4h a day in class is just 
ridicoulus! Teachers at grades 1-3might see days like that, but the average is more. Add the rest of the jobs to be done and most of my collegues spend 6-8h a day in school with home work on top."

Personally I cant even use the degreaser well because the combo mindset is so different from how I normally play. Still, I can see the value in these items to the right people, saying they are bad outright because you cant do well with them doing the exact same thing you do with the other weapons is like saying the huntsman is bad on sniper because you cant scope in with it and it isnt hitscan. 

I assume you could use it really well if you saw a bunch of enemies down range, jumped in, market gardened someone, shot your other three rockets, switched to secondary and got off 6 shots with the shotgun, then jumped out again and got health. A quick hit and run tactic could be devastating. "

Toby-one,MilitaryPorn,1390167065.0,"IFV usually have a crew of 3 (Driver, Gunner/Loader, Commander) while APC usually have a crew of 1-2 (Driver, Commander/Gunner/Loader). Though the resposibilities will differ depending on the model and country. The APC will often be able to transport an entire squad while the IFV will mostly only be able to transport a fire team because the addition of a turret means less space in the rear compartment.

Though these are not really clear cut definition but in general an [APC](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/US_M113_in_Samarra_Iraq.jpg) is an armoured vehicle with a light armament (usually just an MG) whose main responsibility is getting infantry from point A to point B so that the infantry can dismount and fight on foot.

While an [IFV](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/2008_Moscow_May_Parade_Rehearsal_-_BMP-3.JPG) is an armoured vehicle with a slightly larger armament (Usually an automatic cannon) whose purpose is not just to safetly transport infantry it is also well armoured and armed enough to be able to fight alongside the infantry or keeping the infantry mounted protecting them so they can assault alongside tanks and break through the enemy lines.

Though there are a lot of vehicles that won't stay neatly in either of these categories this is however a helpful rule of thumb."

PatHeist,techsupportgore,1390167099.0,"What version are you trying to run? The most recent that will work with video cards is 3.7.2 [{DIRECT DOWNLOAD WARNING}](http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/3.7/cgminer-3.7.2-windows.zip). (Search 'cgminer download' and click the top link, then 3.7, then 3.7.2 zip to get the download if you don't trust me.)

After that, you need to make a text file, then change it into a .bat file, and put in your configurations. You also need an account to mine for most pools, except for middlecoin. If you're mining with middlecoin a basic configuration will look like this:

    cgminer --scrypt -o stratum+tcp://middlecoin.com:3333 -u &lt;your bitcoin address&gt; -p x

Then you can add in things like thread concurrency or shader counts as well as intensity specifications to cater to your specific cards. But that might not be something you'd want to play around with. 

When you're done with that, all you need to do is open the .bat file you've made inside of the folder you downloaded earlier for cgminer. You'll get payouts once a day if you have above a certain number of Bitcoins in your middlecoin wallet, and once a day if you have between that and another number. (I think it's 0.01 and 0.001 or something like that. Which would be like 8 usd/8 cents at the moment.)

Our photographer, since he knew I felt awkward about the whole thing, started joking around and trying to make us laugh. That broke the ice.

Eventually, my fiance and I started saying things like ""Here we go, we're hiking through the forest wearing our nicest dress clothes! And a man we've only met once before is taking our picture! This is so normal!"" This resulted in me cracking up, which made for some great smiles in the photos. 

Just accept that engagement shoots are a little awkward.

* Have a good reason why you did it. One kid told me he just wanted a project that he could eat. That would've been cute if he were a fifth grader. It gets progressively less cute as you get older.
* Pick a topic that you can explain fully. We gave a kid first place for a project that generally wasn't that impressive because he could actually explain what he did and why.
* Please have an actual experiment with clearly defined control and experimental variables. This is a big criterion for middle schoolers.

Intigo,Guildwars2,1390167297.0,"**I would wait until the patch goes live on Tuesday before you finalize your build. In particular, Runes and Sigils are changing a lot.**

* A Staff Elementalist should not be on the frontline the majority of the time. You use your positioning and cooldowns to avoid damage, not 2000 Toughness. 

* Rock Solid is a silly trait for a Staff Elementalist because you are often far away from allies or close to other ranged classes that will not benefit from Stability at that time. Evasive Arcana will do much more fo you.

* I personally prefer either Aquamancer's Alacrity (VIII) so you can spam out Healing Rain more often or Cleansing Wave (X) for a bit more Condition removal. Soothing Disruption is generally not needed.

* You use some pretty bad slots for Critical Damage, but this will probably not matter when Ferocity is introduced.

* You have far too much Toughness. Try to focus on more reasonable numbers so you can get more offensive capability. A good starting point is ~17k HP and ~1600 Toughness, your numbers are far too high. Your Power is obscenely low and you should be aiming to get much better Critical Damage (along with Precision, of course).

* Melandru Runes are OK, but Ruby Orbs, Divinity or possibly another Rune with the changes are usually a better choice. The little -Condition Duration doesn't do much for you and you generally don't need it because you have Ether Renewal (and you won't get many Conditions on the backline).

* Don't use Bloodlust in your build. You should stack up Bloodlust to 25 and then switch to another weapon with a proper Sigil on it (or 2, soon).

**Edit**: Also, if you go 0/10/0/30/30 then you can easily swap between Staff and small scale D/D."

Monosentence,bdsm,1390167304.0,"I can't really presume much considering I don't *know* you two, but perhaps your Dom has some restraint towards releasing himself? As always, open communication is paramount so maybe talking with him to see what kind of answers you can get would be a good idea. Like set him down, and try to work through his thoughts on the matter. You already know he is happy enough already that you're fucked silly by him, that's a given. So work off of that and see if there is another reason he just doesn't need the satisfaction. Maybe there isn't a reason.

Sometimes people just need less or more than others. If he's content with how things are, I wouldn't be too discouraged in your performance. \^\^

Obviously if he's happy with the things you do already, then getting him off is just icing on the cake. Perhaps that is how he sees it, as an unnecessary thing. Great when it happens, not an issue if it doesn't. I know with myself I can enjoy a session without any release for myself, just because of how energetic and invigorating play can be. In a case or two, I've not wanted it solely because I thrived on the adrenaline and that rush was enough for me. 

Again, thats just how things can be different.

It could be unlikely, but he may also feel pressure to perform to please you by letting you relieve him. Sounds funny, but even Dominants (especially so) can feel self conscious. 

If its a matter of physically being unable to finish him off, see about sensitizing cream and aides of that sort. "

Addendum: the resistance one would be likely to encounter would be from the players and the league. The FoxTrax pucks didn't handle quite 'right' and had a higher propensity for breaking as compared to normal pucks.

&gt; 2) The reason most Lions fans are relieved now is because of some of these reports. For example, hearing that **he doesn't want the pressure of being expected to win,** makes it so I wouldn't have wanted him here. If he had taken it as a challenge that he could fight against, that's a good attitude for a coach. **He took it as an obstacle and (based on that report), opted for something easier and with lower expectations.** That doesn't sound like the kind of coach I would want anyways.  

Now, I know that you guys are rallying around what Rapoport is saying, but I read that report as ""Whiz would prefer to remain out of the media spotlight because it serves as nothing but a distraction.""  

Furthermore, without Whiz explicitly coming out and saying it, how on earth can any reporter - much less a fan - be expected to read his mind and know that he can't or won't handle the pressure of being expected to win? I guess I just resent that our coach is being painted as a wuss and our fans are being portrayed as ambivalent to the team's success."

I do think that if you broke a law that shouldn't have been a law, and you broke a law without harming or costing anyone anything, then surely it is simply morally wrong to keep people in prison for it. They haven't hurt anyone, but because some ill-informed people in the past made a mistake they have to stay without their freedom. The law isn't there as a test of whether or not you will follow the law or not, it's there to protect people and punish people for wrongdoing. No wrongdoing should mean no crime, and no crime should be no loss of freedom.

My opinion summed up is basically that if they get rid of a law, they are accepting the law was wrong, and if the law was wrong people were punished for something that shouldn't have been a crime. If they were wrong they should allow the people who have had their lives wrecked by the government's mistake to start piecing their lives back together"

For example...I was drinking occasionally in December (maybe once or twice per week). I wasn't ready to quit completely. The urges to drink were strong and often. I wasn't in the proper mindset to give it up for good, but I was making strides. After about 3 weeks of constant regulation and substituting drinking with other activities (hiking, working out, reading, etc.) it became SIGNIFICANTLY easier. Shortly after that, I gave booze up for good and now I'm at the 15 day mark. I've been completely unfazed and it's been a smooth 2 weeks.


It just takes time to break old habits. You're going to think about drinking. At times you're going to really want to drink. It's up to you to find other things to keep yourself preoccupied/distracted from constantly thinking about drinking.

The idea is to turn EDM shows into something more than a guy with a few CDJs pressing play. It's a performance of the song rather than a performance of messing with an existing song.

Look up that time he passed out on stage and the music stops playing pretty quickly because he's not there to keep it going. If that happened to a DJ the song would finish.

So this being a not live show means it's more of a DJ set as opposed to his big time shows. Which I'm guessing for mau5 means ableton clips so still a large degree of ""liveness."""

It's what I used to play Majora's Mask with my ps3 controller on an emulator. then reinstalled the mouse software and it worked fine. I think that Ps3 software was outdated cause I haven't used it in a year.

Lost_Afropick,AskReddit,1390167764.0,"I think in terms of ""rights"" the family courts and divorce law perception is one that is grossly unfair to men.  

In terms of rights it isn't fair that a woman can have an abortion but a man can't decide he wants nothing to do with a child she's deciding to have.  Obviously, her body her decision.  That's beyond obvious to me.  But whether I'm involved or not in a decision she's making soley without me based on something we both did is equally up to me imo.  

""Rights"" are one thing and imo that's about it.

Whether society is equal or not is completely different.  I'm going to talk about the west here and not the rest (majority) of the world.  Outside the west is a nightmare for women.  

Beyonce came out last week with that disingenuous piece about women making 77% of what men do.  It got far more attention and coverage than the far better researched articles debunking it showing that most of this was women who worked less hours because they themselves preferred the flexibility.  

Here in the west the future is female and overwhelmingly so.  Women have better health, and live longer.  They're quicker to own their own homes than men.  They outperform boys in all levels of education from elementary to university.  And the swing is increasing.  Boys are being left behind.  Not so noticeable now but in the future it will be.  There are already articles in magazines aimed at young women about having to settle and marry ""down"" because after climbing the career ladder they are finding a dearth of suitable men of their *level*.  This will be a bigger issue going forward than it is now.  We're moving rapidly into a world where women will be the chief breadwinners of families (if those exist then) and we're still pedalling false myths about 77%.  It needs to stop.  Not least because men suffer worse when they lose jobs and cuts are made.  Young male unemployment is probably one of the worlds most dangerous forces in sociology.  Male suicide far outweighs Female suicide.  Male prison rates far outnumber Female ones.  Our long held gender roles, be they natural or constructed (different argument for different place) don't allow for idle men.  Mischief finds them.  The ""kept"" man is a disgrace.  Female values and traits (again whether natural or constructed is a different discussion) are the ones that are more highly praised in schools and increasingly in the work place.  Traditional traits assigned to males are now deemed disruptive and wrong.  This is an emasculation of males that shames young boys from being themselves and punishes them for male behaviours.  We'll see in the future how well this pans out.  It's a trend that has even long term feminist mothers of growing boys slightly concerned from articles I've seen.

Media representation has switched 180.  It was wrong in the 60s when women were disrespected and patronized all day long.  It's wrong now while it happens to men.  Some will point to the sexualised nature of what we see on tv.  How women's bodies are objectified and used to sell things.  This is true.  Whether it's wrong or not depends on the woman you speak to.  There is a newspaper in the UK that uses young womens boobs to sell papers.  That's rank sexism and it's embarrassingly silly.  You also note the use of women in music videos, the portrayal of women in movies and Anita Sarkeesian talks about the portrayal of women in games.  All valid criticisms of the way the media deals with and uses women.  But at least it's an issue and a concept every grown up thinks of and talks about.  We know the arguments surrounding these things.  Who talks about the tropes on tv that always show smart bookish girls getting over on dumb physical men?  Clever domineering handling everything wives running rings around childish no good incompetent man-child husbands?  Do we have articles discussing the effect of these things?  How women on tv and in movies constantly physically smacking and slapping men, acceptably.  How it's fine to talk any kind of nonsense about the male but you're a demon should you do that about a little ol woman?  [Bill Maher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x64cy3Bcr98) has a good piece on this.

I watched Harriet Harman, a UK politician talk on tv about how if women ran the world there would be less war and less macho culture in banking and the crash wouldn't have happened and so on.  She was applauded for this.  If this was reversed she'd have had to resign and apologise for months.  This from a woman who chickened out of leading her party anyway and left it to the men when she was the popular figure... I digress

I stray away from people who talk about less female politicians and less female CEOs or directors.  If you want to become a politician, stand for election and convince people to vote for you. The system is in place to do that.  Here in the UK it costs a petty sum to do that.  I suspect less women *want* to go into politics rather than anybody holding them back.  There are slightly more women than men in most countries.  Assuming you could speak to them and convince them to be your voting block you'd be on to a starter.  As for CEOs, I don't see how that would affect the life of the average woman one tiny little bit.   

There *are* things where women are at a loss in the west.  Issues where feminism hasn't actually gone far enough.  The conviction rate of rape is alarming and scandalous.  The trafficking and abuse of women in the prostitution scene is worldwide but it happens under our noses in the west too.  That's a stain on us.  The lack of protection given to women by police and other services from abusive or stalking exes is pathetic.  My cousin went through this and the police were a disgrace.  Didn't take her seriously at all and when they did their hands were tied because he technically wasn't breaking the law with his harassing and following.  Anyway, there is far more work to be done on these fronts.   


I recognise the prevailing need for feminism in society and equality for me is a no brainer.  But I also see a trend where mens issues, largely a taboo and uncomfortable subject will come to the fore in the near future as the pendulum swings.  Right now, to even discuss mens rights and talk about family courts means people call you a sexist and suggest you're from the redpill or something.  I must hate women apparently to be able to read the newspapers and see these trends I'm talking about.  It's a marginalised thing.  We point to the historical treatment of women and drown out the real issues and trends happening now.  But this will change."

Diosjenin,technology,1390168084.0,"""Can't adapt"" is *exactly* the phrase that was running through my mind throughout that entire post:

* ""Tenured profs don't want to change difficult and uninteresting courses"" -&gt; ""can't adapt""

* ""Potential loss in value over learning directly online"" -&gt; ""can't adapt""

* ""Kids might start steering away from traditional courses, majors, and careers"" -&gt; ""can't adapt""

To which I say, tough shit.  As /u/calibrated pointed out, correctly, Yale is a business, which means they are part of a capitalistic marketplace.  When disruptive technologies enter your field, you adapt or you die - which goes double for anything on the Internet, since you literally cannot stop its advance.  Can an institution as smart as Yale take an honest look at the RIAA and not see the writing on the wall?  When the Internet outperforms you, your traditional business model doesn't count for shit.

Unfortunately your rant won't get any of the elitists you run into to shut up, but I suppose you already knew that.  Personally I subscribed to your channel for two reasons.

First you don't put me to sleep.  There are a couple that do, so I need to make sure I'm well rested while watching them.  There are several decent reviewers out there, and only a couple that animate their personalities and can keep even the basic stuff interesting.  You just seem like you'd be a blast to hang out with, your personality comes through, and you cater to your fans and yourself rather than to vendors...  Well mostly, I'm not so sure about your MVP review.  You really didn't seem too into that one.

The second reason is because you review clones.  Can I get an original?  Sure, if I wanted one, but I'm not going to drop north of $200 on a metal tube.  Are they better than clones?  Probably...  But not enough to justify the price.  Having said that, Todd has done a couple reviews of handmade reasonably priced mods from a Russian guy that have gotten my attention...  But I digress.

Here are some facts that are indisputable:

Saudi Aramco is wholly owned by Saudi Arabia; there used to be American oil company involvement but the Saudi's ended it in 1980. If other oil companies controlled the Saudi Arabian government, I think they would get a better price on the oil they buy from them.  

The invasion of Iraq was done through Kuwait because the Saudi Government (the supposed American puppets) would not allow U.S. forces to stage from there. 

All U.S. forces left Saudi Arabia in 2003(how will we control them!). 

All U.S. forces are out of Iraq (how will we control them!)

Given your arguments about how the U.S. wants trade in the dollar I find it laughable that you think European Oil companies like **Royal Dutch** shell wouldn't find it beneficial to buy oil in their own currency. 

If your arguments are valid about petrodollars why is the dollar worth less than currencies like the Euro?

For the first time since Saddam Hussein came to power the Iraqi people are living like they want too. If they want to blow each other up, they are free to do so. 

On Bush, Cheney and WMD. Let's say your argument is valid, that Bush, Cheney and the oil companies came together to engineer a reason to invade Iraq. They created evidence that Saddam was a bad guy (because everybody knows invaded Iran and Kuwait because he wanted to give them kittens) and that he was working on a WMD program. They went through all the trouble to convince the American people and their allies that this was true, but then failed to plant the WMD in Iraq. That's a pretty big mistake, don't you think?

Maybe they didn't fail to plant it, maybe they expected to find it. Maybe they thought containing Saddam Hussein was tying up forces that could be used elsewhere. Maybe the Iraqi National Congress (an anti Saddam group,with members in the U.S.) and other dissident groups told them that if they got rid of Saddam they wouldn't have to hang around.  Maybe they wanted out of Saudi. I know one thing. It wasn't just for oil, because gas would be a lot cheaper if it was.

Sonny Gray: Dude is going to be an Ace. Great stuff, great park, good team that should give him some good wins. He played at the same level as Verlander in the playoffs and could be a steal in the middle rounds.

Alex Cobb: I see him taking the next step to being a fantasy ace this year. Huge K potential and had he not had the freak injury last year could have finished a top 10 pitcher last year.

Tyson Ross: His peripherals suggest he is in for a big year. May have some issues in the W-L department but his stuff is great.

It's an interesting line of thought, although I'm not a subscriber to class theories such as patriarchy myself.

However, perhaps as a defense mechanism they've generally adopted a more pollyannaish view of the world than men.

It's perfectly plausible."

Edit: to adress your other point on $10 not being bad. I agree it's not terrible, but it's not great either. I can get amazing games that are only a couple of years old on PC for $5-10.

NanoNarse,Gaming4Gamers,1390168805.0,"Not since I moved to PC gaming.

When I was on consoles, I would occasionally pre-order games from series I enjoy or games I'd heavily followed in development. Games that, essentially, I was confident I'd enjoy even if they ended up falling short of my expectations. It was nice since I always got the disc on release day, and often a day or two beforehand.

But now I'm on PC, I can pick up games whenever I want. Midnight release? Sure. Want to watch a few reviews or a LP first? No problem. Impulse buy after a day at work? I can be playing in 20 minutes. It's weird, but the added convenience has made me more economically sensible when buying games.

Also, because sales are so frequent, I'll always put off buying a full price game unless I want to play it right now. A sale is so likely to come around before I get around to it, why bother buying it until I want it?"

What do you make of that? If you think it is common sense,  then your past choices were never your own free will,  they were always predestined. And if you think the soldiers are bonkers,  then you believe in free will. You believe we always have choices.  You believe that we can change the future. 

So I struggle with your final paragraph. I have also compartmentalised my life.  Maybe others do too. You can choose to deal with your preferences,  or not,  that is your choice.  But I disagree that you are affected for life.  You can do something different,  but even a tortoise only makes progress if it sticks out its neck.  Take a risk. Ask your partner what secret desires she has never shared with you.  Start some new behaviours in the bedroom.  Displace your past and unsustainable link with something current and accessible.

majekmistake,kpop,1390169062.0,"Here are a couple ideas that I've had. I'd be glad to do the OP for these if you all think they warrant discussion.

* **English in Kpop** - I remember a while ago there was a post on here that was titled ""Is anyone else sick of random English in kpop?"" or somthing like that and half of the comments were just pointing out various examples of ""bad"" English but the other half were thoughtful responses to whether or not the use of English in kpop was positive or negative. **Some potential talking points:** Why is English such a huge facet of an industry that thrives mostly in non-English speaking countries? As a native speaker does the English in kpop have any effect on your opinions of certain songs or artists? Do you think the inclusion of native English speakers in groups is deliberate? 

* **Foreign promotions** - I'm imagining this topic overlaps a tiny bit with the English one but I think it's separate enough to justify it's own thread. **Potential talking points:** Why is it that some groups to better overseas than they do in Korea? What is the role of the international fan? Is it better to have specific sub-units that promote overseas(SJ-M, EXO-M, etc.) or promote as a whole?

Edit: I've thought of more!

* **Well rounded idols** - We can talk about idols that are becoming more active in the music making process with things like lyric writing, composing, choreographing and producing. **Talking points:** Does having a hand in the music making process make an 'idol' into an 'artist'? Who are your favorite idols/works by particular idols who have been involved in their music beyond singing the final product? In the future do you see more idols being more involved in their music?

* **Idol actors** - I'm a kdrama fan myself so this topic is of particular interest to me. **Talking points:** Who are your favorite idol actors? Do you think that idol actors are held to a different standard than other actors? Do you think that involving idols in productions is just a ploy to maximize ticket sales/views because they already come with a fan base?

How a person's gender is formed can be boiled to at least one of these two factors [of course it's oversimplified]:

* Internal sex - How the body sees itself in terms of biological sex. It is possible for this to be fluid. See gender dysphoria that many trans* people experience.

* Social gender - How a person sees themselves in relationship to gender as a social group. This can be fluid.

2. [Agnostic AA meetings.](http://agnosticaanyc.org/worldwide.html) These are great. They are simply focused on sobriety without forcing anyone to say they believe things they don't. That site also has some agnostic versions of AA materials. I find the Agnostic 12 steps helpful.

Being able to avoid PMI is one advantage to not putting 20% down.  But, in the column of reasons not to wait until you have 20% saved up, there are many advantages as well.  Especially for first-time homebuyers who are renting.

I mean, if PMI is a waste, how do you feel about paying a landlord each month?  If I buy a house with less than 20% down, at least *some* of my money is going to an investment and to build equity.  If I continue to rent, *none* is."

brotherbock,philosophy,1390169241.0,"I am not saying that we can't know anything. What I will say is that 'knowing', aside from the Cogito, admits of degrees. I 'know' that my car is in the garage, but of course it might have been stolen. I might not even own a car. (I had a student a few years ago who, until she was 16, did not in fact know what her own name was. Her parents had been calling her by her middle name all along, and she only found out she had a different first name when she went to get a drivers license.)

You can consider your scientific findings to be knowledge. And we should. What I am saying is that *scientific knowledge is defined as coherence*. And coherence admits to the possibility of a different set of theories that cohere *better*, which would then be considered correct. 

Aristotelian physics didn't cohere as well as Newtonian physics. I.E. fewer observations about the world conflicted with each other in Newtonian physics. And Newtonian physics cohered less than Relativity theory. And many relativity theorists and quantum physicists both declare that the other theory has 'worse flaws' than their own--Einstein among them.

But the scientist needs to realize that his theory is akin to putting together an incredibly massive jigsaw puzzle for which you have no finished product picture, nor will you ever have one.

I am not trying to do away with knowledge, that would be silly. I am trying to *define* knowledge."

Daveezie,whowouldwin,1390169430.0,"I don't think it will be easy, but I think Spider-man will take it. Both have super strength, though I think Spider-man is stronger. Both are ridiculously agile, but Spider-man definitely takes the lead here.

With Spider-man being better in both ways, why do I say it will be close? Astartes are armored and armed to the teeth. Everything about them screams ""War."" Spider-man will have a hard time because of a number of things. Most importantly? Bolters! He can dodge bullets no problem, right? Well yeah, but bolters have a nasty habit of exploding, and the force of that could potentially cause him to stumble, which would slow him down.

Now, do I think he would be taken out by a bolter? No. Spider-man would be able to get in close by dodging a few very near misses, but he would get there. That is when the other danger comes in, Chain swords! Those things do not fuck around. A glancing blow with one of those would still be pretty devastating, simply due to its size.

My theory goes as such: spider-man dances around for a while, dodging bolter fire for a few good minutes before he finally gets enough of a shot to blind the space marine with webbing. Now, that shit it sticky, so the only way to get it off is to take the helmet off. Spider-man, while the marine is getting the helmet off, closes the gap and wraps him up in webbing. Marine breaks free, but Spider-man bought himself some time to set up a haymaker that the marine can't see coming."

Miliean,tax,1390169692.0,"&gt; since I'm not a legal resident here

For purposes of Tax law the term resident means something else than it does when you are taking citizenship status.  So your actual legal status as a foreigner in Canada has no barring on your status as a resident for tax purposes. 

Is that permanent residence in the US one that you own?  Do you have american bank accounts?  Those are some of the biggest factors that CRA would look at in determining if you are resident in Canada or the US.

However, an additional important element is intent.  Your post makes it appear that you intend to move to Canada permanently but simply have not cut all ties with the US because of immigration issues.  If that it correct it could mean that you are a taxable resident of Canada.

Your best bet is to find a CA in Canada who knows US/Canadian tax (ideally one who is also a US CPA).  They can tell you exactly when you should start filing Canadian returns along with the US ones.  There might not be any need for the accountant to do the actual returns yet, but you should have some professional advice about when exactly you should start filing in Canada.

Note, the US taxes based on Citizenship not residency.  So no matter where you work or where you live, as long as you are a US citizen you should file a US return."

michaellicious,gaybros,1390169858.0,"&gt; When you're 18, you don't have enough experience to be able to make fully-informed choices about what kind of education or career you want

Ok, this is what really confuses me about your argument. If 18 year olds aren't experienced enough to make their own experiences, then why would they be required to choose at that age? If what you said is true, then 18 year olds would have to wait until their mid 20's to choose their life. I'm pretty sure you had to choose at that age, and you turned out fine. Just because someone's young doesn't mean they're automatically dumb about the world. Take me for example, I know what degree I want to achieve (mechanical/electrical engineering) because of the scarcity of it, how much rigor it will take to achieve it, I have a back up plan, and I know how to save money. Have you ever thought that Noel might be one of the lucky few that developed faster than the rest of his peers so he knows how to handle situations better? He got into porn to help his mother out. I think that's extremely smart and noble, because he knew how much it paid and he doesn't have to do it frequently. But if he was still 18 but graduated from high school, would your argument still be the same?

To me this seems like someone who enjoys smoking who puts on long shows and decided ""hey, I wanna smoke now even though I'm on stage."" Similar to the way Snoop would. Nobody would write a whole article saying Snoop was just looking for attention. 

I feel like smoking for attention is more what Miley did when she used smoking to replace a speech. She didn't have to stay there and preform after she lit up. She just had to say ""thank you for the award"" and leave. Instead she said ""thank's for the award! I don't have a speech...but I do have a joint! okay bye!"" 

And it's not exactly like Lady Gaga wasn't looking for attention before she lit up.

junlinu,changemyview,1390170133.0,"I think you're correct in saying that Twitter is terrible for sharing thoughts/opinions/ideas. It's impossible to share these things with any depth using only 140 characters. 

However, what Twitter is very good for is presenting facts and figures such as sports, finances, and news. I have two separate twitters: one for sports and one for news. I don't follow a single celebrity or friend. 

By picking and choosing specific twitter accounts to follow, one account keeps me up to date with the NBA, NFL, MLB, and FIFA and another tells me about global, financial, and political news. It is professionally but, in my opinion, more important socially important to be ontop of your current events. You look good at work when you can talk with your boss about his favorite sports team and these feeds give me excellent ice breakers and social events."

RandianHero,actuallesbians,1390170147.0,"Fair enough. But consider for a minute the implications of that: do you really want to draw your own sense of happiness and personal fulfillment from someone else rather than within? Being loved and cared for is nice and feels good, but ultimately do you really want it to be *necessary* for your own sense of well being?

Consider the interpersonal relationships you have. Relationships seldom last for more than a few years at a time. People grow, people change, and people move on. In the end, they're present within our lives for the time that they're needed, and then when that relationship has run its course, we move onto the next. And there's nothing bad about this; we have it in our heads that things need to be made to last forever, but relationships -- like people -- are transient by nature. We become so focused on trying to preserve things for as long as possible that we lose sight of what's right in front of us, and in turn, lose the opportunity to grow. People enter our lives at exactly the time we need them.

You'll have more than one love in your life. Of this, I'm certain. And you'll enjoy it for as long as it's enjoyable -- whether that's a few days or a few decades. My advice to you is to do yourself a favor and stop looking for something specific. Instead, go with the flow and see where it takes you. For every heartbreak there's an equal and opposite time of unadulterated joy."

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390170317.0,"&gt; A Bintoa is a culture where gender roles encourage females into being primary caregiver, while discouraging males from being primary caregivers. In a Bintoan culture, caregiver roles may be enforced in various ways, from subtle social pressure to overt legal mandate.

As long as you cover the range of mild to overt pressure towards the above gender roles, then yes, bintoa exists in America. I think it exists, at least a little bit, in every subculture and every community of America. 
I won't comment on other cultures. 

When talking to some other feminists, the parts I object to are 1) they make overreaching generalizations about all men or 2) they cannot or will not define the word itself, or parts of the definition, like what they  mean by ""encourage"". Encourage can have many meanings, from mild pressure, to very strong pressures. But since ""encourage"" was defined above, that's a step in the right direction.

In general, what I object to is an unclear definition. That said, there are some things you didn't define: 

1. Do all men enforce these gender roles on purpose? No I don't think so. Do some men enforce gender roles on purpose? Yes I  think they do. I've seen it myself. 
2. Is bintoa done on purpose, or is bintoa an attempt to name a phenomena? I think sometimes it's done on purpose. Possibly. If a man enforces gender roles based out of fear of change (which I think is a valid issue here), is he acting rational, or REacting based on uncontrollable emotions? Can a person making decisions and actions based on fear be truly ""purposeful""?

The ""all men support gender roles"" is an argument I've heard many times from some feminists. When they decide to define that part. Often though, this small group avoids defining if all men are involved or not. 

Am I fine taking the lead in a relationship? Yes. Am I fine if my SO is a doctor, lawyer, or highly paid professional? Yes I'm fine with that too. 
I'm actually pretty flexible as long as my SO acts like an responsible adult. 
Also, the relationship itself is very important to me. I guess you could say, for me, her role is not important. What is important is her maturity.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390170324.0,"It doesn;t really depend on the length of your cycle, Its more about when in your cycle you usually ovulate, you can have long cycles but still ovulate early.

 If you have never tracked ovulation before its best to use a back up method like condoms for a  *bare minimum* of 3 days after starting the pill. 7 days is usually the golden number for protection when starting the pill while not on your period, But eggs die after 72 hours, so if you are unlucky and ovulate within those 5 days, after 3 days on the pill the egg will be dead.

And justice is not blind. Different situations warrant different punishments and those punishments for a police officer abusing their authority should be treated harsher. 

For the cameras; what if it's both cops changing their behavior and people not filing bogus complaints? Whichever it is the results are good. And yes, they aren't perfect and there will always be issues with police abusing their authority and people filing false reports against them but I feel that cameras will help reduce that.

Life-in-Death,AdviceAnimals,1390170498.0,"I am so confused by your point.  I said women are under-represented in engineering and CS and physics.  There are more women in biology and chemistry than men.  

**But your numbers are WAY off.  10 years ago incoming science and engineering freshman were: 55% male and 45% female.**

http://sites.nationalacademies.org/PGA/cwsem/PGA_049131
(second link under ""undergraduate"")

Other info: 
Still, women earn only 17 to 18 percent of the bachelor’s degrees in engineering and computer science, and just over 40 percent in the physical sciences and math. Where are the women? Clustered in the life sciences. About 58 percent of all bachelor’s, master’s and doctorates in biology are awarded to women.

An animal science major once dominated by men is now 83 percent women. **Women hold slight majorities in chemistry, as well as the biochemistry and molecular biology major, and represent 61 percent of one of UC Davis’ most popular majors, biological sciences.**
It was in 1979 that women overtook men in undergraduate enrollment. Women held a slim majority until the mid-1990s, when their numbers began to rise faster than men’s. Throughout the past decade, the ratio has hovered near 55–45 percent. Women still trail men slightly among the more than 4,000 graduate students, but hold **majorities in many of the professional schools such as law, medicine and veterinary medicine.**

I am also confused about your insight into high school students.

TinaTeaspoon,nursing,1390170610.0,"This has actually happened to me both when I was the patient and the nurse.  

When I was the pt, I had just came out of surgery and was recovering in the PACU.  Nurse came by to take my vitals and I said something like ""I'm pretty sure I'm about to die; my head won't lift off the pillow.""  She assured me that it was the pain meds and to lie back and relax, and I remember saying ""Something's really wrong right now"".  I tried to relax a little, but suddenly realized I was out of breath.  NBD, right; I had lots of opioids and just needed to take a deep breath.  I tried to breathe; nothing.  I tried to move anything; again, nothing.  

It later came to light that I had accidentally been given rocuronium instead of fentanyl right before leaving the OR.  I was ambu-bagged for 20 minutes and given two doses of Narcan before someone suggested checking my TOF, which were 0/4.  Reversal agent was given, and I came right back.

Jesus.  DAT SENSE OF IMPENDING DOOM.

Fast-forward a year, there's this patient on my (psych) unit who looks at me and tells me she's dying.  I kind of freak out, take vitals, which were all WNL for her, but her stomach is distended.  Call the doc, she eventually gets transferred (a story in and of itself), but passes away two days later from a ruptured bowel.

Still makes me cry every time I think of it.  I did everything I could have, which makes it easier, but I was the person she told, and she ended up dying anyway."

hersinisterurge,NarcissisticAbuse,1390170613.0,"You have to get OUT. This is ALL classic N behavior. It's all an excuse to make you feel like shit, to force you to jump through hoops, she places you in a constant no-win situation where her rules are always changing and there is no way for you to make anything right, because that's the point. To crush your self-esteem, to make you feel hopeless and depressed, therefore squashing your motivation and ensuring you'll never develop the self-love to realize that you deserve better and you deserve to be happy. You are a person of worth, you sound like a good, caring man, and there are women out there that would be absolutely thrilled to have you and they would cherish you. Even if you spend some time alone, you would live peacefully and without the constant message being rammed down your throat, ""YOU aren't good enough!"" I suspect that these children are meal-tickets for her, judging by what you've said about her attitudes concerning sex and intimacy. She also without a doubt believes you will never leave. If you should decide to live a happy life, because you only get ONE and if you continue your days this way it'll be gone and passed before you know it- with only misery and that horrible empty feeling to look back on- you'll be blown away by how quickly her tune will change, and it'll be up to you to see through it and know her for what she truly is. On a small scale it's already happened, it's a constant push and pull from her, a game she's playing with her favorite toy. You said you weren't happy and alluded to leaving, she went into 'best behavior' mode and made promises, you submitted and agreed to 'work on things', she hands you a list of more selfish demands. Please keep in mind that NOTHING that comes out of her mouth means anything, you're well aware that none of it makes any sense and there's a reason for that. It's the ""blah blah blah"" of manipulation and abuse. It's the same statement over and over, and that statement is: 'I want to control you.' This is a process, and you're waking up slowly, but you're getting there little by little. My advice is to continue reading and gathering information, because knowledge is power and it's the best way to remove the wool she's had firmly plastered over your face for years now. Look for support, there are supportive people out there. Stop wasting your precious time and energy trying to reason with her, it can't be done. Don't sacrifice any more of your heart for someone that can't see value in it, and only wants to take, take, take. If you ever finally realize how good your life could be, and that it's worth the work and the pain of the process to get there, after a little time and some healing there's no doubt in my mind your only regret will be not leaving much sooner."

windsostrange,leafs,1390170719.0,"I hit the TSN Podcast Centre daily. TSN 1050 has—by faaaar—the least annoying Toronto-based sports talk radio. After being used to 590, you will find the difference night and day. Here are weekday highlights:

http://www2.tsn.ca/window/podcastcentre/

 - 7:45am, 10m or so: Leafs Breakfast, a short Mike Richards segment featuring Darren Dreger. Which is okay. Also sometimes features Steve Simmons. Which is less okay. But Dregs hates Simmons with a passion, so this can be entertaining.

- 9am: Macko &amp; Cauz. Nice fellows. I knew Bob Mackowycz from Radio 2's Strombo Show, and it was nice to hear a familiar (and intelligent) voice on 1050. Conversation is usually Leafs-related the morning following a game, but if it's not then cherry-pick Leafs moments like their regular conversations with awesome journalist Jonas Siegel. These are presented as 10-minute clips alongside the usual full-hour ""podcasts"" of their show.

- 12pm: Leafs Lunch. Features Bryan Hayes (son of Bill Hayes, who is John Derringer's brother, for a bit of small-worldiness), ex-NHL goalie Jamie McLennan, and ex-Maple Leaf [Jeff O'Neill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_O%27Neill). These three are funny. They have a solid understanding of some things (like certain stats), a stubborn unwillingness to accept others (like certain stats), but are always entertaining regardless. Bryan and O-Dog, specifically. These three have that sort of perfect chemistry you hope for in a line of hockey forwards. Give 'em a shot.

- 2pm: O-Dog and Noodles leave the studio, and Hayes doesn't cease speaking until something like 7am the next morning. He talks Leafs most of the time. Often good. Cherry pick interviews and such as required.

Tl;dr: The Leafs Lunch on TSN 1050 is easily the best Leafs-related broadcast in the city. Listen to it."

There are simply too many established powers in place to let UCF win a national championship in the concievable future. Especially with the playoff system approaching. There is no way an undeafeated UCF gets in over a 1 loss (bama/oregon/oklahoma/floridastate/lsu)

Sure, UCF may be nestled in an amazing recruiting hotbed, but that can only take it so far. Coaches will leave for better jobs unless you're at a blue chip school. UCF is also a team that arrived too late after realignment-pocalypse, stuck in a garbage conference with no longer a large stage to rise to glory.

gantt5,battlefield_4,1390170978.0,"Edit: For anyone having trouble with the coloring, I changed the line types/weights [here](http://i.imgur.com/BqKtCh6.jpg). In order from the least drop to the most, the rifles are FY-JS, SRR-61, M98B, JNG-90, L96A1, 338-Recon, Scout Elite, CS-LR4, M40A5, and SV98.

For all practical purposes, all the snipers drop the same amount inside 100m. After that, the FY-JS and SRR-61 have very similar drop patterns for all distances, as do the 338-Recon and the Scout Elite. For all targets inside 800m, the JNG-90 and L96A1 have similar drop. The SV-98 has the most drop, while the FY-JS has the least. 

All the calculations were done using information provided on [Symthic](http://symthic.com/bf4-stats).

For anyone interested in the physics behind the calculations:
The amount of bullet drop is not determined solely by the acceleration due to gravity mechanic. While it is true that all the bullets drop at either 6m/s^2 , 9.81m/s^2 , or 15m/s^2 (Earth's real gravity is ~9.81m/s^2 ), the differing bullet velocities change the total amount of drop. This is because the amount of time the bullets drop is different. By using bullet velocity and acceleration due to gravity, the drop profile can be plotted. 

I calculated the travel time to a set of distances and calculated the travel time for the various rifles to those distances. Then I used the calculated times to calculate the amount of drop, assuming the rifle was fired from a horizontal orientation."

Thjoth,Survival,1390171076.0,"There are plenty of modern structures that use turf roofs or (more often) partially covered structures.  It cuts your electric bills in half during the hottest and coldest months, and can help you go completely off grid when used in conjunction with solar and wind power, which is more money in your pocket.  There are quite a few places that offer tax breaks and subsidies for green roofs because of their ability to reduce the urban heat island effect and provide substantial greenspace inside of a city.  Plus, the modern version is sturdy enough that you can actually do some serious horticulture on top of the structures, as long as they're built with concrete and sheet metal.

I'd actually argue that turf roofs are actually pretty impractical in a survival situation due to the amount of time and labor it takes to put them on a structure.  I suppose if you're at the point of building a permanent structure, it doesn't really matter and you're putting the time and labor in anyway, though."

ibbity,SubredditDrama,1390171125.0,"The argument I've seen is that women are inherently incapable of pulling their weight in any traditionally male job because they're all too ditzy and emotional to handle it and none of them have any physical strength at all and also their uteruses automatically render them useless. Then if you pull up any examples or stats that differ with them on that they ignore it or claim that it's feminist lies or say that it's 100% bizarre outliers and no man would ever want such manly unfeminine women. As in, they think that women should be *banned* from these professions, and in no wise take into account actual job performance in their judgement of the issue.

As a woman who spent 6 years loading trucks with no special help and who pulled her own weight quite nicely, along with the other women (roughly 1/4-1/3 of the total workforce at the UPS hub where I was employed), this tends to annoy me. 

Granted I wasn't a soldier. However, women are now going to be sent into combat by the US; they've been serving close to, if not actually on, the front lines for some time now, not to mention the female fighter pilots who've been doing their thing for longer than that (and the women who faked being male to enlist; there are over 200 recorded cases of this from the US Civil War alone. None of the women were discovered by their lack of fighting skills, incidentally.) I also have to wonder if these dudes ever look at the history of countries other than the US, because Russia and the other nations that formerly comprised the USSR sent women aplenty into battle right alongside the men as far back as WWII and they don't seem to have crapped up those countries' militaries any.

Ymbryne,ffxiv,1390171284.0,"I haven't seen this mentioned yet, but unless you have a crazy amazing cash flow, you need to level botany alongside culinarian, and fishing wouldn't hurt either. There are so many mats that go into CUL synthesis, and 90% of them come from botany or fishing. There are a few drops, but you can easily avoid those recipes and still level to 50. 

As others in this thread have said, level all of your DoH to 15. This nets you some really strong cross-class skills, and gets you a ton of shards in the process. I would strongly suggest getting Weaver and Carpenter to 50, which should be very easy if you are leveling Botany. If not, you can still do pretty well with just the level 15 cross-class skills.

You're going to need a LOT of fire and water shards. If this is the only job you'll be leveling in the immediate future, see if anyone you know will trade (or better yet, donate) shards with you. Farming your own shards? You'll also need to get Miner to 20 so you can get the Fire/Water wards. Personally, shards often get so cheap on my server that I don't farm my own shards anymore, since it's more cost-effective for me to farm other stuff or do large bouts of synthing for gil.

It's going to be tedious at first, but always TRY to high-quality every item you make. This gets you way more exp, even if you don't hit the HQ on a given synthesis you still get more exp the higher the quality bar is.

Make everything in your crafting log at least once.

If you have levequests piling up, use them. Look up any of the countless websites for DoH levequests and find the ones that are turned in to Bango Zhango in Limsa Lominsa, preferably the ones that you can repeat 3x. If you turn in HQ items to these, your exp is doubled, and it's also a great way to earn some of the shards and gil back that you've spent making them.

If you've really got a lot of gil to throw around, consider hiring a 50 CUL to HQ levequest turnins for you. Would I personally do this? No. Why? I'll tell you, and also talk about something else that's important: low level crafting materia.

Make sure you're getting your CUL outfitted with level-appropriate crafting gear, and spiritbinding it. Once you've outgrown and replaced it, convert it, and sell it for anywhere from 3k-30k. Low level crafting materia is actually still in high demand on most servers due to the way forbidding melding % works. 

Of course, if you have plans to be pumping out the 2-star HQ food down the road, you might consider holding onto those materia for your end-game gear. The important thing I'm trying to say here is just that you should be spiritbinding your gear to 100%, replacing it with an upgrade, and converting it. If you skip through the leveling process by 'cheating' levequest turnins, you miss out on a lot of valuable materia. 

Sorry if any of that overwhelmed you (I don't know your experience in the game), if you have any questions feel free to ask. "

I need to sound like someone who can take care of her. So Paul it is. Although maybe that's **too** informal. Fuck it, here we go.


I raise my hand to the door and knock three times. Three nice, authorative knocks. Two would be too short, it would show a lack of confidence. Anything more than four would be annoying. They sure are taking their time answering, it's already been like 5 seconds. Should I knock again? Never mind, I can see him coming down the stairs. I hope he wasn't sleeping or doing anything important. Oh god he looks annoyed, did I do something wrong? Maybe he was masturbating. Do old men masturbate? 


Has the distance from the stairs to the door always been this long? Should I wave at him? Maybe I should wave. I'm gonna wave. Shit, he didn't wave back. He must be really pissed at something. He was definitely masturbating. The door finally opens.

""Hello."" 

A good start. Although he sounds even more pissed than he looks. The old man can't like jerking off that much that he'd be this mad at an interruption, right? 

""Hi Mister Paul."" 

Fuck.


""Jessica isn't in at the moment."" 

""I know. I kinda wanted to talk to you about something, if you've got a moment.

""Not really. But come on in.""

Here we go. The dance of wits begins. The battle for Jessica's heart. He leads me in to the front room. He sits down in his chair. It's really his too. I remember playing boardgames on the floor with Jessica years ago and the old man sat in the same place. Even then she'd let me win, and even then I knew she was going easy on me. But it made us both happy, so I guess it didn't matter who won. 

I take a seat opposite him. The speech flows through my mind. Months and months of effort for this moment. Tender feelings of love and affection from over a decade of companionship put in to a couple of hundred words. 

""Paul. As I'm sure you know, I care very much for your daughter, and she cares for me too.""

""No.""

Well that's put me off.

""No as in that I care very much for her, or that she cares for me?""


""No to your question. To this whole thing.""

""I haven't asked a question yet. Sir.""

Sir. Keep him on my good side. Respect.

""But you're going to. You're going to tell me how much you care about her and how you were made for eachother and how nothing could tear you two apart and how you want to marry her.""

Marry. The word hangs in the air between us and I can't help but catch a brief mental glimpse of Jessica's smiling face as I ask her to marry me. Marry. Me.

""Well, yes. But-"" 


""I've said it already. No""

""But..."" 

That's all I've got. I hadn't planned for this. Fuck.

""Look kid... Jessica isn't too well. She wasn't visiting friends out of state last month, she was at the hospital. It's spreading again.""

His voice catches. I can't speak or mine will too. 

""Doctors say she's it was caught too late this time. She's got a month left, if that.""

""But...""

This is definitely off script. My mind has frozen. Maybe he's confused. Old people can get confused. Jessica **was** sick, but that was years and years ago. She's better now. She's not sick. He's wrong. I should tell him. 

""You're wrong. Jessica is fine now.""

He looks at me again. That pissed looks is still there, although it doesn't really look that mad now I look at him. If anything it looks like he's in pain, like he's been wounded. Our eyes lock. His eyes start watering as he looks down to the floor and slowly closes his eyes. 

""Not this time.""

He sounds too far away. My ears are feeling strange. I try to speak, to tell him that Jessica will be OK, but my mouth isn't doing what I want it to do. Someone makes a quiet moaning noise. Was that me? Don't cry don't cry don't cry. Men don't cry. His shoulders are shaking, like he's laughing, but I can't see anything funny. Is this a joke?


""Stop laughing.""


That was too loud. I didn't mean to shout. He takes his hands from his face and he looks at me. His eyes are red and his cheeks are blotchy. I don't think he was laughing. I think I'm crying now too. If he's allowed to cry so I can I. We're both men. Maybe sometimes it's OK for men to cry too.

On top of this, the enemies aren't zombies but actual humanoids, described as basically being human cannibals with feelings and a heirarchy of needs. So, they're not mindless swarms, but may run off or become scared, or try different tactics depending on the situation. They described a scene where if you killed one of them, another one would burst out crying over the corpse of the slain family member.

Laozen,taoism,1390171520.0,"As far as I can tell yes, but they're the yin to the Jedi's yang.  From what I can tell, Sith consider might to be right, so in that sense they're Max Stirner-esque egoists, but they believe that they are freed and empowered by passion and emotion, that denial of the self is essentially weakness and that man should embrace his position as power.

In a word, yes, you're right, they're along the lines of Satanists and Objectivists.  However, from what I can tell, actual Sithists also believe in some basic tenets of Buddhist and Taoist thought, but sort of polarized towards embracing the dark aspects of the ego, with the thought that power is balancing force.

Honestly if you ask me, they're far too caught up in power-based thinking, but I doubt there are more than a handful of people who genuinely consider themselves Sithists, and their ideas (basically social darwinism taken to its logical conclusion points) aren't exactly new, it's just a rebranded Machiavellian philosophy.

EDIT: I realize now why you were asking, because that isn't the same as Discordianism, I just meant to say in my earlier post that there were people who claimed to be Sithist who compared the two.

I'm also finding dismissal of sexual assault of female soldiers and claims that most of the reported cases are lies.

Life-in-Death,AdviceAnimals,1390172396.0,"I don't know.  Here are some thoughts.  I would be very interested in hearing from female Tech and Engineering majors and how they did get into it.

1. There is a documented change in female students between I think 6-9 grades in which females go from very participatory in class to very quiet, even though they are performing better in classes.  

2. Most engineering-type toys are ""male-centered.""  My brother got that electrical engineering set.  I got a computer drawing pad.  It is a combination of marketing and parental preferences, etc.  

3. Video games (an populare entry way into computers) are still-male centric.

4. I wrote above: I *never* would have thought to take a CS or engineering class.  I never had any classes about them in high school and wasn't even sure about what they were.  It didn't even seem like an option to consider.  This is also including: My father was a PhD engineer.  I aced ""computer"" in Jr. High.  I was the first girl on the Water Polo team and the only girl to take metal shop, etc.  I aced all physics, chemistry and calc classes I took in college.

It seemed at that point that you already had to know about computers to even take the classes.  If there was a mandatory intro in HS where girls were exposed to these things it might help.  I don't know why boys seem to be so much more familiar with engineering at this level."

It can be used in a propper way as a an imperative language, it does OOP pretty well and can even handle functional (although that is something someone should do only if they are intrested in becoming a recursion master).

ibbity,SubredditDrama,1390172564.0,"Average woman will be smaller than average man, wherefore she will have less physical strength. However, this assumes that the average female soldier will be ""average"" in terms of national standards of size, weight etc. In a military where physical standards are one-size-fits-all, all the women would have to meet the same standard that all the men would. Therefore, while there would be differences between soldier and soldier, the idea that female solders as a group would uniformly be inferior to male soldiers doesn't hold water.

 In terms of the current military where women get a pass on certain aspects, I would have to say that a woman who fits the national average in terms of size would have less strength and speed than a man who fits the national average. (Endurance is more tricky because it's less easily measured and there are different kinds of endurance, so I wouldn't pass judgement on that one off the bat.) So I can concede that there are certainly female soldiers currently who have less strength and speed than male solders, because there are women currently enlisted who would have been washed out had they had to pass the male physical tests. IMO these women do not belong in the military, *not on the basis of their femaleness but on the basis that they are not physically fit to serve, just like men who can't pass the tests.*

I don't take umbrage with the idea that women who can't pass the male physical shouldn't be allowed to enlist, because I agree with that. I take umbrage with the idea that women shouldn't be allowed to enlist, *period,* and that all women are so inferior to all men that no woman could ever pass the male physical tests OR stand the mental and emotional strain of military/combat duty, because this is demonstrably false.

&gt;Just reading the latest news that they slashed their sales forecast by 60-70% is not a good thing, in fact its down right horrific. People are right to scrutinize, because if it carries on this way they wont have a console to play anymore. 

This is bullshit. Nintendo aren't going to come in the night and take your console away. Nintendo aren't going to stop making first party titles this generation. And if you bought the WiiU expecting a flood of high quality third party titles then you either have no memory or are living in a fantasy.

Nothing has changed, except now a whole bunch of people who are more interested in brand wars than they are in actually playing games have swallowed some story that the end is here right now and forever.  Yes, Nintendo have messed up their marketing and made other mistakes. We get it. 

But no-one with a head on their shoulders expected some amazing run from Nintendo this time around. They bought the WiiU because every now and then a phenomenal title would become available that's simply not available anywhere else. End of story."

&gt;It should be no surprise that unpaid interns abound in fields that are highly socially desirable, including fashion, media, and the arts

Oppression! They're choosing the fields everybody wants, down with patriarchy!

The majority of adjunct faculty? You mean there's a ton more female teachers in general? Who knew! I guess a lot of people get into teaching when they graduate from college at a rate 50% higher than their male counterparts with unemployable degrees.

Care workers? The article cites nothing except to say a lot of women take care of children and old people.

&gt;Ironically, DWYL reinforces exploitation even within the so-called lovable professions, where off-the-clock, underpaid, or unpaid labor is the new norm

Holy shit, people in the super indemand jobs that everybody wants are expected to work harder to keep them, because lots of people want those jobs. Blame men! (Newflash: Check the 'unpaid' hours you work as a software engineering related fields that women cry for more women in)

So basically you need to introduce yourself. See if you can find some common ground, like something that happened during class that you can comment on. Maybe the teacher/professor did something funny and you saw her snicker at it. If all this fails, just go and say hi.

Forget about ""asking her out"". As a non American it always strikes me as strange how there's so much focus on this. It's just needless amounts of pressure too early on.

I've programmed in C and java and although I'm not the best at it, I'm decent enough and did some projects like multiplayer asteroids and some image processing in java. Then I started C++, it all started as C with classes. And then assignment overloading came and I was like: dafuq and quit programming in it. Maybe it was because of the speed in which it was thought to me (because it was a voluntary class at my university) and the style in which it was done (there is only 1 solution, so even if you're code works and performs the same, if it's not exact the teachers solution, it's wrong!), but all in all the step from C to C++ should not be underestimated and is actually quite big, as with C++ there is a lot more to keep in mind, so much it actually boogled my mind."

&gt; Gies, Frances and Joseph. ""Women in the Middle Ages""
&gt; 
&gt; ""Piers Plowman"", a medieval poem, mentions duties of plowmen's wive that included sowing, reaping, gleaning, binding, threshing, and winnowing and sometimes even ploughing. ""From Workshop to Warfare: The Lives of Medieval Women (Women in History)"" Carol Adams
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking of gleaning, it is apparent that women participated in that as well: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleaning

Obviously, I've said that we should see the position of women as a distribution of tasks within the household and if work needed to be done it would get done. It still doesn't say anything about who preferentially did it or how often.

&gt;Now what exactly the source for your assertion that medieval lords were finding labour by going to the Cottage Depot parking lot and loading up the back of his cart with ""average"" strapping males for peasant labor?

I talked about differences in wages, which necessarily can only be gleaned from records from more commercially developed economies. At that time and place the practice of day laborers existed. There's very little we have to go on in the later Roman/early Medieval manorial and feudal system, which are characterized by a scarcity of sources. Most fantasy goes for Renaissance or early modern style anyway, so it's more relevant as well.

&gt;Finally, before we to too far down a rabbit trail, let's remember that your main original argument is that in a fantasy world, women wouldn't be respected as fantasy adventurers because chopping wood is the business of mensfolk.

There are some circumstantial variations of the above, but for the most part you need all of them to flat out solo someone.

As a result, your options are pretty limited when it comes to applying pressure. Each cooldown you burn makes your kill combo less consistent. You can plink away with Flame Barrage but you'll never kill someone with it unless they were already low HP.

This isn't an issue isolated to Sorcs. Archers have to blow almost every cooldown they have (Stunning, Concussion, Combat Kick, Explosive, RoA etc etc) during their wombo combo. It's the price you pay for 100-0ing someone. In group PvP you can be a little more selective with which abilities you use for what simply because your allies will, assuming they know what they're doing, be setting up kills for you."

Because of that, I can fly a well fit Helios, capable of scanning anything for about 1/5th the cost (or less) of a Stratios hull alone.

That means I can lose my ship a few times and still profit.

But—perhaps more importantly—the Helios (and other similar ships) is a genuine CovOps ship unlike the Stratios. That means you get a shortened reactivation time which makes dealing with gates all that much safer. The time it typically takes to actually jump through a gate is nearly always as long or longer than the reactivation delay for a cloak on a Helios whereas you nearly always have to wait a while before you can move after a jump in a Stratios.

Valve/Gabe has mentioned in the past that ""they would make things right"", but that only covers off the dozen or so games Valve have released (never mind that if they're in administration, it likely wouldn't be their choice any more to remove DRM from these games). 

What about all the older, 3rd party, games that use Steam for DRM? Will *every* publisher invest money into going through their back catalogue to remove/change Steam DRM? Of course not, as we're seeing here.

Also, stay healthy. Team took too many blows on defense. Wilfork, Mayo, Kelly, Talib. It was bound to break down some time, and unfortunately that day was today.

Re-sign Talib. If any injury proved how valuable a top CB can be it was him. Defense couldn't stop anything when he went down.

Get a WR taller than 6 feet. Throwing to all guys under 6 feet is not going to win you a Super Bowl.

All that being said, I think the team is still in terrific shape. Like I said, they injuries were just too much to overcome. We field a healthy team today and it could have been a much different outcome."

I think that toxic thoughts make us...toxic. While few of us are as equitable as Ned Flanders, if you can't forgive people who are selfish, maybe experiment with punishments *other than* death? How about sitting through an entire Justin Bieber CD. On repeat? 

If I was more logical, I would point out to you that anyone who is dead is unlikely to care whether or not they are blamed for their own death. So why does it matter to you? Who would decide who is ""contributing to the evolution of humans""?

What if the arbiters of who lived or died decided that *your* destructive, negative mindset is not really contributing to the evolution of the human race? How would feel then? Would you shrug your shoulders and say ""OK, fair enough!""

Anyway, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States) is a link to the belief system that underpins your philosophy, and my only comment is that there are so many things in life that can potentially gnaw away at us, if we let them make us toxic, eventually it is us who suffers, not them.

If I said out of the billions of grown women in the world, I'd really rather not have you masturbate to my sister, I think a man should be capable of that. And I'd respect his wishes as well.

funkymunniez,nfl,1390173630.0,"Yes, Knighton.

As far as I know, no one here really likes McDaniels.  He often seems to be calling plays to try and show just how ""clever"" he is which usually always backfires, makes calls that make no sense (calling long pass designed plays on 3rd and 2? the fuck?), and just generally isn't that great.  I honestly feel his reputation is way too inflated from his time as the OC for the Pats in the 2007 season.  The Patriots would have had an amazing season with just about anyone else at the helm with the way that team was built, but he gets all this credit when in fact, a lot of people I know believe him to be a very mediocre coordinator when it comes to calling plays."

We have picks, one this year, Bobcats pick, the 3 we got from Luol (Hey if the guy who pointed out the lakers can bring up 2nd round picks then so can I) after that. Rose Returns, we get the best player not in the NBA coming next year in Nikoli Mirotic (God so excited, hope he works out) and probably will get rid of Boozer. Oh, Taj and Noah are in their prime too so that helps..OH Taj, his post moves are developing sooo nicely. Not to mention he's an *elite* defender. You can bet you'll be hearing more about him next year once he gets those starter minutes"

abdullah10,AskReddit,1390173691.0,"Who says people haven't seen one? Maybe they have but the time traveler swore them to secrecy.
Assuming no one has seen one though, I'd guess it's because time travelers know that if they announce themselves as time travelers then the present world would obviously want the technology and this might carry out a chain of events that alters the time line that created the technology, leading to the technology never being invented. Therefore no time machine would've been available to go back in time and announce to the world there's a time machine. It's called a causality loop I think. Or I'm just confused and sleepy."
