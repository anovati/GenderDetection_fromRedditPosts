Scarcer,microgrowery,1390093497.0,"Generally the number of additives in the GoBox actually complicate the situation; and no one should need that many bottles for growing in soil. If you have an issue with your nutrient program, you're not going to know what you did wrong and the first solution is to cut down on the additives.

8 bottles is a lot, even by hydroponic standards, and isn't necessarily going to make a better crop.

A good nutrient product has 99% of what's necessary for success; maybe add some cal/mag for that RO water.

**Yes, it works;** but I don't believe it's appropriate for beginners, sort of gimmicky."

Safilpope,AskReddit,1390093499.0,"Off the top of my head, the maximum single dose of paracetamol over 4 hours is 1000mg, if you took 2 doses of 1500mg over 2 hours you'd have taken three times the max dose. If you've been taking it over several days you'd be way higher, as it builds up in the system. So a bit more than a slight overdose!
Side note for anyone interested, the max daily dose is 4000mg, and after a week you should seek a doctor - partly because of the build up of the drug, but also to check out the reason you're taking it in the first place.

Side effects of the medication do include skin reactions (cant remember specifics), so that might be it. I'd also note that if you've been taking that much over a long period of time, see a doctor - one major side-effect of ODing is liver damage.

If you're needing that much medication I recommend seeing a doctor; or if you live in a country where that costs money, a pharmacist who may be able to recommend more appropriate medication for you to use."

I work for an internet gaming advertising company (I'm on the dev team), and some of the ladies here rock some seriously colorful and adventurous looks. I usually wear the sort of makeup that you do, and I think that's considered a professional and good in this area, as long the eyeliner isn't too heavy. But the college I started out at would have not been such a good place to wear makeup. It would have gotten one labeled as umm.... probably promiscuous, and certainly not a **serious scientist**. Once you start working in an environment where STEM people have to interact with non-STEM people, makeup isn't a problem at all. "

RadiumGirl,OkCupid,1390093517.0,"I have a couple of thoughts on this one:

* This is very dependent on age, I think. There's a big difference between a 'just finished college' aged person, and a 30-something, living at home. Being older and living at home suggests that something has gone wrong (the GFC, lay offs, illness, familial obligations), or there is always the possibility that the person just didn't think to plan earlier and is doing so now.

* I don't need *you* to provide me with a solid financial future. I'm 27yo and I've already secured that. I have a good income, my own property, and investments. I'm not looking for a guy who can 'look after me'. Also, I prefer dating older guys, so I'd assume that a guy in his mid-30's has already sorted out his financial future. 

* Like all preferences on any dating site (or IRL), people don't have to 'settle' for something they consider a disqualifier if they have other options - and OkCupid is no exception. So, as a 28yo male in New York I'm guessing (and I don't really know, since I'm in Australia and don't know your area) that the women in what I assume is your demographic, simply have the luxury to date men who have jobs and their own places. My partner is, financially, in the same boat as me because I had the luxury of choice - and I guess people probably lean towards people who are similarly minded to them.

* Dating someone who lives at home means that he/she either always sleeps over at my place, or I sleep at their place and have to interact with their family - which may feel awkward and premature. 

It'd probably be better to have worded it ""I'm just trying to ensure I can meaningfully contribute financially to our life together - fuck me, right?"", but that's much less catchy :P

They fixed sand generators and everyone complained, but nobody complains now. We'll live. Still, while the Iron Foundry, and the Iron Trench before it, are neat concepts, they do supply so much iron they are really as bad as sand generators.

I feel the old style of these farms where you had to build cells spaced out and such were okay. Gold farms where you had to figure out how to get on the nether were rare enough I didn't think they were such a big deal. Especially when they didn't let you just break the bedrock. Ironically, I feel iron farms helped the craze of gold farms.

On the other hand, I really feel this is better fixed with a different form of balancing. Perhaps make it update every door in range when you place any door so that villages always merge. Perhaps for gold farms, don't run code on how many portal blocks, but rather per portal and/or disallow portals from stacking (i.e., 4 portals in a cube portals count as one portal for pigmen spawn purposes and disallow from making a tunnel of obsidian and lighting every block)."

A couple hours later, I looked and my palm was basically one big blister. I don't recall it hurting particularly. I didn't tell anyone. My mom was very punitive, and I was too embarrassed to tell my friends.  

The next day at school, my friends said they tried it, but it hurt too bad, so they dropped the ice immediately. ""Ha, ha! Yeah, me too!"" That was one of the first times I consciously thought, ""Hmm, I might be a little weird.""

After the blister broke, and my hand started to heal, you could clearly see the letter ""J"" on my palm. I was sooo excited, because my crush's name was Jay, and surely, this meant we'd get married! I mean, once he noticed me and stuff.

I think the fallacy surrounding college is that if you graduate, you'll make a lot of money. That's just not the case. With my job (I'm a D class Electrical helper) I get compensated well for my skill level, but I actively learn every day I'm on the job, and since I work through a contractor, I generally work more than 40 hours a week. When you get on a big job, you can work upwards of 60 hours a week (which is when the big money rolls in).

I don't dispute this. If you're going to be pragmatic about knowledge, fine. If you're going to be skeptical, fine. But don't vacillate between the two to suit your own purposes. Its my contention that is what Brian is doing.

&gt;&gt; After all, your sense of self is sufficiently explained by the possibility that you do, indeed, have a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you.

&gt;There is strong evidence against this. From frontal lobe disinhibition to fMRI and a thousand shades in between, the notion of the mind as this private entity is absurd.

I think you mean there are theories in development with no consensus. The notion of the mind being a private entity is absurd?! I think you need to define 'private'.


&gt;&gt; Meaning is entirely subjective. If you don't ascribe meaning to something, it is meaningless. If you do, it has meaning. A deity that is manifested as uniform natural processes will be ascribed meaning, without doubt, and this is confirmed by most pagan religions.

&gt;Explanatory power and predictive power are both concrete things that can be judged. A meaningless deity lacks either. 

You're begging the question. A deity that is meaningless to you is not necessarily meaningless to someone else. You aren't the arbiter of meaning.

&gt;Whether or not it gives you warm fuzzies or makes you feel better about the world, it remains a vacuous concept.

Whether or not your ascribing meaninglessness to a deity gives you the warm fuzzies or makes you feel better about the world, it remains a subjective act, not an objective reality."

I live in the Netherlands. Here we have multiple parties and these all have their own seats in congress. And parties who don't have any chance in the polls can still get a seat in the senate. This is already infinitely better then the American system. But still needs improving. It's still choosing for the lesser evil.

p3ndulum,poker,1390094352.0,"PF - fold &gt; raise &gt; call

Off-suit ace+middle card is a junk hand. Can't make a straight or flush, and lots of opportunity to run into kicker problems.

F - call &gt; raise &gt; fold / fold &gt; call &gt; re-raise

I think he's leading because he flopped an ace or stronger and wants to start building a pot, hoping you have an ace or draw.

When he 3-bets the flop, I think 66 or a made flush, *maybe* QQ, and sometimes he has Ax-Xc, and could also have AQ. If he's a maniac, he's got Kc plus a broadway draw.

You're only ahead of all aces here, and I don't see him playing much of anything else you can beat this way.

I'd flat all streets hoping that a fourth flush card doesn't hit, but calling a third bet on the river would be tough even without another club hitting the board.

T - fold &gt; call &gt; raise

Kc+broadway draw just improved on the turn, if not complete, and AJ with the J of clubs just moved ahead of our hand. Now we're only beating A7+ (four hands) and the combo draws, but I don't think any of them are getting played this hard.

When you're winning, you're only about 4:1, but the hands you're losing against have you drawing to 2 outs (~19:1), so this is definitely not a big pot hand.

R - fold &gt; call

As played, I think you should fold to flop 3-bet because of how few outs you have versus villain's value range. Otherwise, I'd flat all three streets as long as the board runs out favourably/doesn't counterfeit me.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390094474.0,"Well, before getting into this discussion, I want you to understand that not everyone may abide by the same concept of morality as you do. 

As an atheist, I do not believe we have any rights, really. I believe we originally existed in a Darwinian state of nature, and were guaranteed nothing. If you died, you weren't fit enough. Tough luck on you.

But then, something happened, a primate species began evolving. We began banding together and using communication with one another. We exchanged thoughts, and these thoughts grow. We formed groups because these were beneficial to our survival. We sought better lives than the ugly, Darwinian (or Hobbesian) state of nature offered.

That being said, we can structure society in any way we want. However, I think the gravitation toward morality and governance is that such rules are generally made to improve our lives.

As far as Locke goes, which is where libertarians get their property rights fetish, I agree, if we are to form societies, they are to protect life. That is their primary directive. What about liberty? Well, in joining a society, we give up some of our liberty in exchange for more/better life. I think rules should have good reasons behind them, and I don't believe we should make rules limiting liberty for craps and giggles, but because they actually improve our lives. 

Property? While property can make our lives better, it doesn't always, and it's not a fundamental right IMO. You know there are some societies that don't have concepts of property? A lot of tribal groups don't believe in the concept at all. And some don't believe in property in an individual sense, but a collective sense. Everyone owns everything, but at the same time, no one owns it exclusively. I think individual property is a nice way of doing things, but not in an absolutist sense. I think when it produces bad results, we should go back to the drawing board or compromise or whatever.

And that's my argument of why others are entitled to the fruits of your labor. Because in modern society, it's the only way millions of people will be fed, and live lives relatively free of exploitation. Private property rights make sense in an ever expanding world like minecraft, or even the old west, where there was always the option of moving west, or out from the center of the world in MC terms. But as you know, we've advanced where someone owns all the land, people own the means of production, and there's no real way for people to make their own way. The only option people have, is to rely on others' labor. Now, we do this via capitalism, where people work in exchange for food and resources, but as society has advanced even more, we've found this system exploitative. Not everyone can find work, and a lot of the work out there is unpleasant and very poorly paid. 

So, the argument is, hey, we have these guys who own the means of production and are very successful according to these property rules, and we have these other people, who aren't successful and who are often exploited. So what we do is we take just a bit from those with more than enough, not because we don't want them to enjoy the fruits of their success, but because they have so much and even if some is taken they'll still be orders of magnitude better off than those who are worst off, and we give to those who are worst off so they're a bit better. Some may find this unfair because they decided they worked for their money, but on the other hand, without government you wouldn't have property, or protection from the government in the first place, so this is totally fair. Since the status quo relies, more or less, on the rich to give to the poor either out of self interest or in charity, and seeing how this is not working out well, I think it's perfectly fair for the government to step in and change the rules in order to make the lives of those at the bottom better. After all, even aftert axes, people who get boatloads of money still have boatloads, and people who are worst off are a bit better off. It's a compromise of your property rights, with the well being of the general public. It's not good for society as a whole for wealth and income to become concentrated at the top, where everyone else gets scraps. What the rich and libertarians want is a form of institutional darwinism, where the strongest do very well, and the weak...well....**** the weak. But that's not the kind of society I want to live in, and considering how successful we are, we can do better.

Heres' the thing that you really need to understand, if you take away nothing else from my post. Morality is...subjective. While it has some objective elements in it because actions and consequences are objective, how we frame debates and build up our worldviews are subjective, and they can vary. We all have different ideas of how things should be, and what's fair. And we don't HAVE to view the issue in the sweat of your own brow argument, but rather take a different approach with different opinions instead. I think from a purely consequentialist/utilitarian perspective, your concept of principle is a horrible one. Let's reframe this...why should the masses suffer and do without, with the worst of them literally starving to death, while you have so much it's obscene?...you have more money than you can spend. You say you work for it, but so does everyone else. You say the contracts are voluntary...but that's a tricky word....people do things they otherwise wouldn't when their other option is starvation, or a gun to your head, etc....is it really voluntary if it's done under duress or if the system is inherently exploitative? And looking to the future, as automation and outsourcing leads to more people without work...what should happen to them? Should they just starve to death while you live in excess? Once again, not the world I'd want to live in. Easy for you to defend it if you're well off, but if you're not...well...again, it's darwinism...oh well, you're screwed...have fun dying of starvation or from an easily preventable illness.

Why should we accept your framing, when it's so riddled with issues that are easily recognizable the second you step out of it? 

As you noticed, I generally avoided the concept of rights btw, as I don't believe in them. I think rights are subjective, situational social structures that are general rules or a form of guidance to be followed in attempting to achieve positive results for humanity. I only see them as useful insofar that they provide good results. I don't believe that your concept of property provides good results, so I'm happy to compromise it for the sake of the public's greater well being."

So in showing that the exact opposite is true, how am I splitting hairs? The number of American accents are increasing in number and people are moving toward more individual accents. It's the opposite of your statement, not ""hairsplitting."""
Ingenium21,offmychest,1390094574.0,"I subscribe to feminist ideology, but don't consider myself a feminist.  Mostly because of a lot of similar reasons to you, OP.  I am a cis male, although not white, and have found that subscribing to a more secular humanist ideology is better.  As a secular humanist, I embrace things like logic and reason, social justice, ethics, and philosophical naturalism.  

Regardless of that, I treat women with the utmost respect, I believe that a wage disparity exists, and I believe that I am afforded some privileges as a man that some women miss out on, just like they are afforded some privileges that I miss out on.  

So yeah, if you want to give yourself a title, i suggest that.  But until feminism finally merges all of their collective ideologies, and trims the tumblr warrior ideology, I will continue to distance myself from it."

Dantilli,socialskills,1390094781.0,"I wouldn't suggest trying to read things out, that just reinforces the ""this is a fake voice"" kind of speaking. Just when you are trying to speak to someone have a play around, try and make your chest vibrate as much as possible when speaking, that's how I did it. I also try and visualise throwing my words at them, the further they are, the harder I have to throw. As for loud situations I imagine being surrounded by a viscous fluid that I have to overcome by throwing harder. I found that thinking about it in the right way helped MUCH more than practicing any exercise. Edit: Talking itself is plenty enough practice as long as you actually practice when speaking to people. You're basically just trying to change your speaking habits so you need to make the change when you speak to people not just when you're reading things out.

Oh, I realise I didn't answer your other question about how my lessons helped... well put it this way, I used to sound like I was still going through puberty (I'm 20...) I had THAT little control over my voice. It used to crack a break often and I could only speak in a high pitched voice. Now I can use it however I want.

I never have time to finish games and often lose interest. This game, I MADE time, and then went back and played it again on a harder difficulty. No game I can think so well captures the feeling of having an enemy that is ACTUALLY superior to you. From the very beginning, you are outgunned and desperate, but it never feels wrong to be so. Winning actually feels meaningful because you know that your choices and effort are the only thing that have brought you to that point.

I believe that happened in december.

&gt;There are so many more games out there they could bring out of retirement, and they simply choose not to most of the time.

Correct me if I'm wrong but weren't all the Nintendo games for the NES,SNES and N64 released on the Wii?

&gt;For as much as Nintendo fans love to point out all the potentially great games that are coming for the system, that’s not terribly helpful when there’s no telling if an anticipated game is coming out in two months or two year

All the games they list are due this year. They were all announced almost a year ago and only Yarn Yoshi was the one that seemed early in development. We know that SSB and MK8 are coming this Spring. Nintendo only announced titles when they're close to finished so we can be pretty confident that we'll see most of them soon. The only one I can see slipping is Yarn Yoshi. Since Hyrule Warriors has only just been announced I wouldn't be shocked if it didn't come out this year."

I have also taken the liberty of researching the definition of rape according to *Irish Law*.

###[Criminal Law \(Rape\) Act, 1981](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1981/en/act/pub/0010/sec0002.html#sec2)

         Meaning of “rape”.

        2.—(1) A man commits rape if— 
                   (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse
                        does not consent to it, and

                   (b) at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless 
                        as to whether she does or does not consent to it, and references to rape in this Act
                        and any other enactment shall be construed accordingly.

             (2) It is hereby declared that if at a trial for a rape offence the jury has to consider 
                  whether a man believed that a woman was consenting to sexual intercourse, the 
                  presence or absence of reasonable grounds for such a belief is a matter to which the
                  jury is to have regard, in conjunction with any other relevant matters, in considering 
                  whether he so believed.




###[Criminal Law \(Rape\) (Amendment) Act, 1990](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0032/sec0004.html#sec4)

          4.—(1) In this Act “rape under section 4 ” means a sexual assault that includes—
                     (a) penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis, or
                     (b) penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or 
                           manipulated by another person.
              (2) A person guilty of rape under section 4 shall be liable on conviction on indictment
                   to imprisonment for life.
              (3) Rape under section 4 shall be a felony.

 
Nowhere does it imply coercion is rape.You are attempting to fabricate a flawed definition of rape, contributing to feminist ""rape hysteria"" which is an insult to genuine rape 
victims. [yes I observed you post regularly to feminist subs](http://redditgraphs.com/?Lurks_And_Votes&amp;PieChart&amp;Length&amp;Comments)

Especially if you are talking about BDSM, and not sexual acting out because of emotional/mental issues or trauma, assuming you're not just trolling. I know a lot of subs and the majority of them are successful, outspoken and extroverted in their public life. And there's a lot more to D/s relationships than someone wanting to be dominant and someone wanting to be submissive--I know a few couples who are 24/7 but are totally, 100% in love, and respect and trust each other more than a lot of non-D/s couples I know.

I am quiet, shy, have little self-esteem, lots of psychological problems, generally agreeable, and really fucking nice to most people. So, I should probably be a sub, right? Well, I'm not--I'm a dom. While I can switch if I want to and can thoroughly enjoy being slapped around and called names once in a while, I'm a fucking brutal master to the core. Does that mean I want to treat everyone I know that way? Do I want to torture all men and force them to be subservient fuck toys? No, not at all. Because domination is a part of my sexual life, not my daily life.

1. Go to http://myrrlyn.com/fonts.html not because this is shameless plugging for my website project, but because I'm holding some font files that you should have.

2. Install fonts of your choice. EDIT: Install guide

    1. The right side of the fonts page (or the examples below) point directly at the font resources. If you follow those links, you will be presented with a .ttf to download. Save or open this, depending on how your browser and OS work.
    2. If your choice does not result in an automatic open, go to the location of the files you downloaded.
    3. Open them. On Windows, this results in a window that presents an example of the fonts in a sentence. THIS WILL LOOK HORRIBLE. These fonts do not have terrific lower-case support. That doesn't matter. The CSS here automatically capitalizes every letter for proper rendering.
    4. On Windows, there is a button on the top that says ""Install"". Click this. If you use Mac or a Linux distro, ~~God help you~~ I don't know how those work. Paging /u/numinit....
    5. Upon refresh of any page featuring CSS-directed TES text, your system will provide the correct symbols.

3. Come to /r/teslore and think to yourself, ""golly, I wish I could write in Daedric, or Dovah, or Dwemer, or Falmer.""

4. REALIZE THAT YOU CAN, IN FACT, DO THIS

5. Use the following syntax in your text that you wish to transliterate.

    1. Daedric: `[Daedric text](#Daedric)` renders as [Daedric text](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Daedric.ttf#Daedric)
    2. Dovah: `[Dovah text](#Dovah)` renders as [Dovah text](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Dovah.ttf#Dovah)
    3. Dwemer: `[Dwemer text](#Dwemer)` renders as [Dwemer text](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Dwemer.ttf#Dwemer)
    4. Falmer: `[Falmer text](#Falmer)` renders as [Falmer text](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Falmer.ttf#Falmer)
    5. Mage Script: `[Mage text](#Mage)` ~~renders~~ will render following Saturday's update as [Mage text](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Mage.ttf#Mage)

**You will see plaintext if you do not install these fonts**

You **must** have these fonts installed on your system for this to work.

The method I use on my website instructs the browser to fetch the font files from my site's files and display them. I **cannot** use this on reddit, due to technical limitations of their CSS processor and this is a setting that I believe was done for a very good reason.

This feature is purely stylistic sugar and can only enhance your experience. You miss nothing by not having these enabled. If you don't have the fonts installed, you see the standard font kit. Which, by the way, if you haven't installed [Roboto](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Roboto.ttf) or [Inconsolata](http://myrrlyn.com/resources/fonts/Inconsolata.otf) then you definitely should. They are the primary sans-serif and monospace fonts called by the /r/teslore CSS and let me tell you they are both terrific and I highly prefer them to the backups. Credit for font selection goes to /u/numinit, who is the connoisseur to my wino.

____

~~Edit: I am aware that these methods make the text red. There's a hotfix en route.~~

Note: This only works in Markdown-formatted areas: posts, comments, sidebar, and wiki. Thread titles are not parsed by Markdown and attempting to use it will title your thread with the exact text string, which will look silly.

I will look into a feature that uses link flair methods to call for font changes and see how that goes.

# Apocrypha Hosting

So yes. I have a website now, for which I have total control over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Granted, I don't really know JavaScript that well yet, so the only implementation so far is to make things slide open and shut. But I digress.

The main page of myrrlyn.com has a list to the right. About half those links actually work, and those that do, point to pages in the /apocrypha directory of the site.

Anyone who has a piece of theirs featured in the [Compilation](/r/teslore/w/compilation) who sends me the raw Markdown of said text will get their piece hosted and formatted nicely. FURTHERMORE, if you send me supplemental materials (music, images, videos, etc.) I will embed those in the page as well (as seen on [Aurbis: The Musical](http://myrrlyn.com/apocrypha/aurbis-music.html)).

I would like to make it clear that this is by no means intended to supplement submissions to /r/teslore. This is purely an accessory, and an optional one at that.

Poor people tend to be more overweight. The poorest state in the US is also the most overweight. Also there is a genetic link to obesity in many cases. Rich thin people are sometimes people who eat a lot but get special surgeries. Not always though. I have no opinion on ""This is Thin Privilege"".

No seriously they're ableist. Call someone out for using retard as a slur, you're a SJW PC etc. People who are dis- or differently able* are people and shouldn't be used as insults. Also is it possible I could donate to Race to Recovery, it sounds like a good cause.

Again I don't hate or like everyone linked on /r/TiA. Especially queer exclusionary radical feminists who can and have done actual damage. Yet I think that /r/TiA's stances aren't the best viewpoints either. They seem to be really big on identity policing, fat shaming and ""ironic"" use of slurs.

*Deaf, autistic, etc. people are not disabled yet face many issues that disabled people do. So I use dis- and differently able as an umbrella term. Of course the boundary around dis- and differently able can be blurry so it depends partially on self-identification."
duckface08,AskWomen,1390095225.0,"At work, I can hold my pee for hours and hours, but this is because 1) I'm usually so busy that my mind is not even focused on my bladder and I almost forget about it and 2) I'm usually so busy that I don't keep myself hydrated enough so I don't have to pee as much as I normally would if I wasn't working.

I work 12-hour shifts and I've had a couple of days where I did not pee at all while at work (so, considering I don't usually pee right before or right after work, that's about 13 hours without peeing). It's not a good habit, though."

BrooksConrad,tall,1390095239.0,"I think the term ""Napoleon Complex"" gets thrown around in a similar fashion to ""OCD"", on the internet in any case. It's not used to refer to any actual mental condition, it's just a catch-all term for a specific, stereotypical behaviour: In this case, it's that short men are sometimes perceived as scrappy.

Whenever I hear it, I always remind myself of the old adage, ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog!"". I did 5 years of Karate when I was younger and the shorter members of the group were just as capable physically as the taller ones.

AetherThought,uwaterloo,1390095275.0,"Daniel's lamp broke almost one year ago in a tragic pass-the-lamp drinking game. Yesterday, he received a spam letter in the mail with an unsettling title. As you can see, this letter is mistakenly addressed to:

Daniel
Who Lost His Poor, Poor, Lamp
Or Current Business

Nothing can be said to right this or in any way excuse such a mistake. We, as the next generation, are going into the workforce, and must ensure the longevity of our beautiful, irreplaceable lamps. It is important to consider the impact that our silly drinking games have on poor folk like Daniel.

And just because we can toss around his lovely lamps without regard, doesn't mean we should.

There are a few things in this world we should endeavour to keep out of our data-driven economy; the loss of lamp is certainly one of them. As you will all (I am sure) agree, the market value of a tragedy such as this should be as close to infinite as possible. Milk the absolute shit out of it.

Skirtz,banjo,1390095276.0,"Yeah I've had my eyes on the RK-35 ever since someone else mentioned it on here. I've noticed that some banjos sound ""Twangier"" than others. Some banjos seem so twangy that just hearing them makes me think of hillbillies and the movie ""Deliverance"", while others (like Bela Fleck's) sound a bit more mellow and subdued. What is that due to, mainly? Would that be the tone rings or the head or what? Also, one of the employees at my local music store talked to me at length about banjos, and I remembered him saying that usually you can tell a decent banjo from a cheapy one by the number of ""lugs"" around the head. Their lowest-end model that they had in stock had 8 lugs, the middle of the line model at 12 lugs, and the highest-end model they had had 24 lugs (those numbers might be a bit off but you get the idea); but I think he said that sometimes banjos will have even more than that. Does that factor in much to the quality of the sound? If so then how many should I expect to have for my first banjo?

Final question: It seems that the banjo, more so than a lot of instruments I'm familiar with, has a lot of parts that can be replaced and upgraded. Would it be a smart thing to buy a banjo like the RK-35 and upgrade it over time or would that just not be worth the money?"

But, having said that, understand that when someone has an attribute that is considered by society to generally be attractive (looks, money, personality, etc), you're going to have more competition for that persons affections. You're lucky in this instance, because they've already decided they're interested in you - so just go for it. If you feel you're not as physically attractive as them, then make yourself more attractive in other ways such as kindness, be interesting, be funny, be the sort of person people want to be around.

lamblikeawolf,infj,1390095482.0,"""Middle"" of three children. My older sister is 7 years older. (technically, 6 years and 364 days, because her birthday is the day after mine.) She is incredibly extroverted and was always trying to tell me how to live my life. However, she has renounced her trying to tell me how to live my life because a lot of her poor life choices have recently caught up to her in quick succession in the past four years. I also have a younger brother that I get along with excellently.

My parents argued a lot when my sister was still living in the house. This is largely because my dad is a narcissist and emotionally abusive. One of the things about emotionally abusive narcissists is that they treat anything that their child did wrong as the end of the world. Because putting away plates too loudly (I did this) is treated the same as carving up the toilet seat with a pair of scissors (my brother did this). And my sister, being a ""stereotypical teenager"" did a lot of things that got her in trouble. But my dad would overreact. And then my mom would have to step in so that my sister wasn't cowering in the corner with my dad literally standing directly next to her and screaming (yeah, that happened once before my mom woke up to the situation).

Growing up in the household of a narcissist kind of paints everything else that you ever do. Because you have to learn certain things at a very young age, like ""I must never make a mistake on anything ever"" (great fuel for perpetuating Ni-Ti loops forever!) and ""I must learn to read my parent's mind."" (Wonderful Ni development because of that.) You also become hypersensitive to the emotions of people around you (Go Fe, go!), both to predict when an outburst is likely, and because the narcissist ""trains"" you to be subservient to their needs. On the other hand, Ti also gets a lot of work, because there are so many [inconsistencies to pick apart.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fu7ms/i_hate_my_father_he_got_a_dog_today/)."

Look at the whole ""Operation Rainfall"" situation. First Party developers in Japan developed some fairly popular games (Xenoblade and The Last Story more so than Pandora's Tower). Xenoblade even got some of the highest review scores of the generation from various Japan reviewers. American (and European, to a smaller scale) audiences tried to let Nintendo know that there was a demand for the games, and yet absolutely nothing happened. 

Nintendo of Europe actually listened, and shortly into the campaign announced all three games for release, fronting the bill on translation and voice acting. Even after that happened, Nintendo of America didn't do anything, until numbers came out of just how many people were importing these games. Then when they finally gave in to the fans, they did a tiny release. The game practically sold out, and yet they still barely recognize it. 

NOA is just as bad as Japan when it comes to making decisions for the average gamer. I say give NOE a shot. "

mattshill,AskReddit,1390096048.0,"If Britain and Ireland shared a religion they would have a much more similar relationship to what Scotland and Wales do with England. As I said the previous invasion from England of Normans into Ireland integrated well because they shared a religion.

Spain only wanted to invade Britain to make it catholic again after the pope excommunicated Henry and the proceeding few queens/kings. The alliances formed with the Netherlands, Sweden etc by Britain at this time are all due to religious factors.

Republican and Unionist cultures differ in a lot of ways, religion is just one. The GAA had rules effectively baring Protestants the OO is only for protestants, most of this un-shared culture developed in a reactionary manner to differences in religion in modern times. For example large parts of the anglo-irish population in the ROI are responsible for the Gaelic revival of 'Traditional' Irish culture but the proceeding 100 years of history marginalised them and they were excluded from it. Marching etc is for a religious community creating a 'Us Protestants' and 'them Catholics' situation.

Loyalists is the wrong term in the modern context as most are not blindly loyal to the crown but unionist democrats the two groups are not the same. The want to be ruled by London was due to a fear in the late 1880's that a Dublin Government would treat them as badly as London treated the catholics of Ireland (This caused the Presbyterians to change sides). Those fears ironically were right with a fall of protestant population in the ROI from 10% to 2%, Northern Ireland became a cold house for catholics too.

The last paragraph you wrote is just utter bollocks, like from start to finish, you fail to see how the religion is the cause for most of the resultant culture and ingrained sense of nationality on both sides as well as transgressions of the past. Don't even make me start on the last sentence in an archaeological context being complete historical revisionism."

If you don't have access to a sauna, you can jerry rig one by wrapping a towel around your face and holding it over steam (like from a kettle) for a few minutes. This opens up your pores and makes it easier to clean. Wash your face right afterward, preferably with some kind of acne wish, and then rinse with cold water to close the pores again. I used to do this a lot as a teenager; short of Accutane, it was the only thing that really helped."
citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390096066.0,"&gt;I'm talking about the brain.

&gt;The human brain does not produce a unified process identifiable with consciousness. Feedback in the executive controls largely localized in the prefrontal cortex are probably what gives rise to the subjective experience, but there is certainly not a black box containing 'you'. 

But there is a meat box that contains 'you'. I just don't see how it makes any difference if your sense of you arises from rubbing your elbows together, or from feedback from executive controls in the prefrontal cortex or from the magic of dualism - your sense of you won't change even if one of these mechanisms is proved true. Describing *how* something works has no effect whatsoever on the way it works. It doesn't matter *what* produces the sense of personal identity on a personal level, it only matters that it *does*. 

&gt;There are a whole bunch of examples of places where consciousness suffers from spot failures, from glossing over the blind spot to more intricate stroke symptom denials. Continuation of identity is enforced by the brain despite both nightly interruptions and massive shifts over time.

So it is your brain that forces a continuing sense of identity, not some malicious daemon or cosmic computer programmer. I agree that what you're saying is not really controversial, but it isn't relevant to the discussion of whether extreme skepticism, that posits the possibility of evil daemons tricking ""not you"" into believing you are you, is compatible with gnostic atheism.

&gt;It's not *just* a Ship of Theseus dilemma, though that definitely is in play. Simply put, how do you jump from a reductionist or anatomical model of the brain to a unified mind, preferably one that correlates with consciousness? Subjective experience is *not* a valid reason, as that would be present whether a unified mind is present or not.

This is not an easy question, even for the foremost experts in the field. It remains a mystery, but it looks like a field of study that is going through a bit of a revolution, so there is hope it can be resolved."

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1390096109.0,"I disagree about the Kobe assist not being valuable. It depends on the shot. You're right, if you're thinking Josh Smith-esque 3 pointers, the Kobe assist isn't probably valuable. But if you're thinking a playmaker breaking down the defense and missing a layup/floater/other close basket, then that Orbd% is probably a lot higher than 12% (which is an average of all shots, including bad shots and post shots [hard to rebound if you're fading away, for example]).

It's one reason why it's better that a guard (who is unlikely to get offensive rebounds) shoot a lower-percentage shot (e.g. a midrange shot that's made ~38% of the time iirc) than a center to shoot a same percentage shot (e.g. DH12 shot ~40% with the Lakers last year in the post iirc).

But yeah, the whole point of the article isn't to illustrate that missing shots isn't bad. It's to show that there are certain shots you miss that aren't as bad as missing other shots---and that maybe we should rethink how we look at the missed FG stat (e.g. Vince Carter's FGs are **really** bad for the team if I'm remembering correctly)."

duckface08,Animesuggest,1390096117.0,"Like the others said, it'll depend a lot on your own personal tastes. However, I've seen a few series that I felt were completely terrible and their MAL scores adequately reflect my thoughts. They are:

* [Togainu no Chi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/8449/Togainu_no_Chi) (MAL average: 6.50) -- The only completed series on my list that I've rated a 1/10. Terrible animation (where they bothered to animate things at all), a vague and poorly written plot, and really generic characters who are either boring or annoying (or both). The review by kindergraph on its MAL page pretty much gives a good explanation of why it's so bad.
* [Ookami Kakushi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/7079/Ookami_Kakushi) (MAL average: 6.53) -- This was supposed to be a horror series, especially coming from the creator of the Higurashi series, but it ended up being a laughable excuse for horror. No, really, it's laughable, like laugh-out-loud laughable. The main character is a pathetic wimp who has as much intelligence as a spoon, his classmate has an obvious crush on him to a stalker-ish level, and Nemuru is a generic mysterious emotionless girl. People from the town disappear but no one seems to really care, so it never feels quite as serious as it should.
* [Arcana Famiglia](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12967/Arcana_Famiglia) (MAL average: 6.44) -- The first episode made it seem like the series was going to involve some awesome fighting tournament between people with super powers, where the winner would get the mafia leader's daughter's hand in marriage. What it actually ends up being is some romance/drama/slice-of-life crap, where all the characters are incredibly generic and forgettable, and the plot deus ex machina's itself out of any significant problems. Someone has lost their memories? Oh, look! Here's a person whose special power is to restore lost memories. Problem solved. Any action was smooshed into the last half of the final episode, and it was really just a montage of various characters swinging swords/fists and such. It was completely anti-climactic. Also, the antagonist's name is Jolly."

Euryleia,EQNext,1390096130.0,"Is EQN even going to be on Steam's Early Access?  It's an interesting discussion, but 90% of what TB goes on about is entirely off-topic here (e.g. having Valve enforce certain standards on Early Access releases).

EDIT: For anyone who hasn't seen the vid, it's TB talking about Steam's Early Access program and the problems with it regarding standards, information disclosure, how it affects Stream's front page, etc.  It's not actually a video about early access to games in general (although some of the issues raised could be more broadly applied), and in addition to being about Steam's program specifically, it also focuses on indie games, which SOE certainly isn't.  We could certainly have a discussion about early access in general, but that's not what this video is, and it's pretty much entirely off-topic in the context of this forum.

The takeaway from the TB vid is that Valve needs to enforce better standards for what information is released by developers using the Steam Early Access system, how that information is presented to Steam customers, and how they need to improve display and filtering of this information on the front page.  I agree with all this entirely, btw, especially the filtering part.  I hope someone at Valve pays attention to this vid.  Not sure if it's of much benefit posting it to a Sony-focused forum..."

Restaurants will tell you this is built into the cost of the food. If they had to pay full wages, they would raise the cost of food, and you wouldn't pay for it because fast food down the street is cheaper, especially considering the expectation to tip.

The sad part is they are correct. Restaurants in some states fail frequently because it's hard to compete when you catch no breaks on costs. I can't count how many restaurants fail around here (California) if they are not backed by a well known name because they are considered either too expensive or they sell below cost because California pays tipped people minimum wage.

TL;DR - each state is different but expectations seem to work to lowest common denominator that they are paid less than min wage, sometimes as low as 2.13."

1. Marching bands. It seems more exciting when a team scores a touchdown because their fight song is played, and when a team needs a defensive stop a familiar tune is usually played (Star Wars or the War Chant for example) and makes the play on the field seem much more crucial/critical

2. Bigger stadiums/crowds tend to be louder (at least to me anyway)

squeadunk,PlusSize,1390096841.0,"Ok, if she thinks Lane Bryant is too expensive she's going to be stuck in a world of cheap knit clothing that falls apart and doesn't fit to be honest. And that's going to contribute to her being unhappy with her body.  Also, you're going to have to buy online for the best selection.

Since she seems to mostly need business casual clothing here are my suggestions:

Lands End (pants/chinos can be hemmed to the exact length you need), swimsuits are great, I've had decent success with their dresses, cardigans, jackets, blouses, high quality tees.  It's nice because I can order online and return to my Sears store.

Talbots: near me there is a talbots outlet that carries plus sizes.  It's a smaller selection, but they are usually having a 30-40% off sale of some sort and they are high quality. Talbots online does carry plus size, but it is SHOCKINGLY expensive and I don't recommend it unless you can get a GREAT deal on clearance items.

If she thinks Lane Bryant is spendy, she'll think these next two sites are ridiculous.  BUT I've purchased a couple of items from Kiyonna and Igigi that I LOVE.  

And if she thinks dresses fit her oddly she needs to check out Igigi.  They have the most spectacular dresses.  I currently own 3 dresses from there and they are SO FLATTERING!  They have a body type search, then will make dress recommendations based on your body type.  And I've never had it be wrong.  I get so many compliments when I wear my dresses.  And they're so beautiful and comfortable.  And do look at the sizing guide because they make different suggestions based on body shapes.

I do find the random top/sweater/pair of jeans from Lane Bryant.  All of my panties are from there.  I find them the most comfortable.

I agree with your wife on the ""old"" selection at Avenue.  My 60+ year old mother shops there and I've purchased maybe 2 things there ever that I've liked.  

Old Navy is good for yoga pants.  And that's about all that I like from there.  Everything else is disappointing, pulls and tugs, is an odd color, or frays and gets holes within the first month or two of use.  But my yoga pants I've had for 3-4 years and they're going strong!

eshakti is fabulous for dresses/tops/skirts because for a small fee (like $10?) they will make the item WITH YOUR WIFE'S EXACT MEASUREMENTS!!!  Gorgeous outfits :)

JCPenney and Kohl's are also good places to look.  They will be more hit and miss.  I have had some items I love from there and I've thought some of there other clothes belong at Avenue.  

ALSO, do look at the measurements in the sizing guides on websites.  To make ""plus size"" more difficult, I wear different sizes at different sites.  I pretty much always wear a 24/3x on the bottom.  But one site (that I didn't list) I wear a 1x.  Really.  

Also, depending on the site I wear a 1x, 2x, or 3x on top.  Usually at Lands End I wear a 1x in knit tops and a 3x in woven tops because of my hips and stretch.  Talbots I wear a 2x-3x.  Lane Bryant I wear a 2x.  Igigi I wear an 18-20.  Kiyonna I wear a 2x.  Penney's and Kohls I wear a 2x.  It all depends.  "

Of course, at the time i didn't know that it was a real person. and if i knew it was i wouldn't have had such a harsh criticism as i did. You know why? Because people have feelings, and NOBODY wants to hurt people feelings and in turn look like the bad guy. So they keep their mouth shut

But they think it 

Not fully, but they have that *twitch* of abnormality when they see something different. Nobody says it out loud though, cause **feelings**

But it was drawing, and drawings aren't people. So what feelings are there to hurt? None. So i sprayed my crtisistict semen all over that bitch. All i was just trying to do was make you a better artist, by being harsher than most of these pussies around here. You get better with a good smack to the face and push in the ring, not stopping when you feel a little light headed.

This isn't a movie, and I'm not that wise old man that knows everything (even though i want to be) I'm just some fuck with a keyboard that tried being a cool guy for a little bit. Failed. **Miserably**. Its up to you now i guess, to make things better.

Sure, people with (e.g.) breast cancer in the US may survive longer *after the initial diagnosis* than in some other countries.  But that's only because the US spends so much money on early detection.  Still, you're more likely to die from breast cancer, prostate cancer, etc. in the US vs. other countries.  That's what mortality rate is about.

The number of medical tourists leaving the US is 10 times higher than the number of medical tourists coming to the US.  I think that speaks for itself.  And that doesn't even include the thousands or maybe millions of people who get their pharmaceuticals from Canada and Mexico."

For Str builds, I really like the Golem Axe. It requires a high investment in Str, but it's very versatile. Its attack speed is good for a Str weapon, its damage is good, and its 1H R2 fires a projectile that can be used 20 times before it needs repairing."

porpoiseoflife,Animesuggest,1390097901.0,"I have two for the Ultimate Anime To Avoid list.

The first, and I'm surprised that it's taken this long to enter the conversation, is Boku no Pico. It is pure hentai. It is trap hentai. It is about a single Supreme Court decision away from having to serve 3-to-5 years in a federal penitentiary just for having admitted that you have seen it. (Have I seen it? Let's just say I rely on my Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.) And it has SEQUELS! Regardless of what the idiots on YouTube keep saying, the truth is to never ever watch an anime with Pico in the title. 

The worst anime ever is [Tenkuu Danzato Skelter Heaven](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3287/Tenkuu_Danzato_Skelter_Heaven). I thank the names of every deity ever uttered by the mouths of humanity that this show was only a single-episode OVA instead of a full series. It is among the most gods-awful things I have ever put in front of my eyes, and that includes the time I scoured my knees straight down to the bone. I've seen some shit, and Skelter completely and totally blew it all out of the water. 

It is done by Idea Factory, the same folks that gave us [Mars of Destruction](http://myanimelist.net/anime/413/Mars_of_Destruction). MoD is the Plan 9 From Outer Space of the anime world. It is so absolutely awful that it is fun. Skelter has absolutely none of these qualities. It is not a show for watching. It is a show for avoiding at all costs."
Malne,TheBrewery,1390097902.0,"Thanks for your input. As it stands, I'm not under any compulsion, be it legislative, contractual or company policy, to keep my pay rate to myself. If you peruse my posting history and worked at my brewery I have no doubt you could adequately identify me and I'm not afraid of that. I feel fine doing so as I'm not bad mouthing the company, I'm asking outside sources for information regarding a wage negotiation. I'm not afraid to play the squeaky wheel if I need to do it to get greased, but I'm not looking to make demands or even seeking outside offers. If someone in management sees this and doesn't like it or retaliates, all that means is I've gained more information and can make an informed decision about my employment, or they'll make it for me. 


This isn't my first step into business, I got into it because I wanted a rewarding career without the drama of the corporate world (as much as can be anyways). I know what undercutting pay does to wages over time and I know the faster that I can start making my way up the pay scale the better off I'll be long term. I like my job, I like the people I work with, I like the benefits I receive. I'm motivated, ambitious, intelligent and resourceful and I can do a lot for a company, but I don't feel bad asking for what I feel is fair compensation and this is one of the ways I can get a grasp on what fair is.

Anecdotally, some kids a couple years ago were selling original essays to kids they knew from high school who went to a different state university, and they ended up getting expelled. But they were kind of stupid and obvious about how they went about it (Facebook posts soliciting business and whatnot...).

We all had identical machines, and while we all managed to break 1Ghz pretty easily, I got mine to 1160Mhz, again with air-cooling.

Phantom_Scarecrow,geek,1390098012.0,"A few years ago, the Toonseum in Pittsburgh had a show called ""The Art of Akira"". It was artwork from the personal collection of Joe Peacock, who has the world's largest collection of cels and backgrounds from Akira. He showed us a few amazing details.

1. The scene where the motorcycles are racing down the alley. They pass a window. It is halfway open, because it's hot in the summer. The light coming from the window is 3 shades of yellow, for the open part, the closed part, and the overlapping panes. This detail, along with the rusting pipes, the electrical boxes, the trash in the alley, are on-screen for 1/18th of a second.

2. When the helicopter explodes, fragments fly in all directions. You can piece them together and reassemble the helicopter.

3. Flyover scene of the stadium, with the darkened city around it. The city is mapped out, with streets and buildings, but it's all black-on-black. Even looking closely at the painting it's hard to see them, but they are there.

No one will EVER make a movie again the way Akira was made. The massive level of detail is so difficult and expensive, it will never be replicated."

But it is a bit unclear because the source that seems to be the one everyone is [referencing](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/mbt-x.htm) states:

&gt;The vehicle is armed with the 120-mm L44 smoothbore cannon, built by Japan Steel Works, Ltd.

Which could mean a new gun, a derivative, or it could mean that it is license built. If it is a new gun then I suppose that it will be called: Japan Steel Works 120mm L44. Though I do find it extremely unclear so it would be good if someone could check any official sources."

For example I did the treadmill, bike and the elliptical all in a 2 hour period and go close to 1000 a day( that's what the machines say but it's lower than that). And do some weights as well. In short dedicate 3 hours to mostly cardio and some muscular. And eat mostly vegetables. "

AdamColligan,news,1390098823.0,"I think you are mistaken about two things here:

1. You state that that victims of child pornography ""can only know the picture has been seen if the cops tell them"".  This seems patently absurd to me. These victims are not Luddites living under rocks on the moon. They know how big the market is for these images and videos, and I would bet that more and more of them know that even as they are being filmed.

2. You estimate that ""about 10 percent of people who possess child porn are sex criminal in other ways. The cops say it's many times that.""  

Per http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2012/12/a_depraved_world_fbi_agents_wa.html :

""According to a study conducted by Michael Bourke, a leading sex-offender treatment specialist and chief psychologist for the U.S. Marshals Service, 85 percent of men arrested for the possession and/or distribution of child pornography have also committed a hands-on offense against a child."" (I believe that would be http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-008-9219-y ).

I feel like your thesis is untenable in light of that figure. Either the correlation between ""hands-on"" offenses and possession of child pornography is higher than your 10 percent guess, or the authorities are overwhelmingly targeting subjects within that smaller sub-population, not trawling for ""mere"" viewers the way you imagine."

--

This was posted on /r/atheism, and I wanted to take a stab at answering Dawkins' challenges.

&gt;Richard Dawkins has gone on the record as saying he would never debate Creationists because “they’ve won the moment you agree to have a debate at all. Because what they want is the oxygen of respectability.”


**This is weak and cowardly. If they're wrong, and you have the truth, how is getting a forum to speak directly to them a bad thing? Dawkins is scared, because he knows there are good answers to his questions, but he doesn't want his followers to be subjected to them. Ham on the other hand, invited someone directly opposed to speak to his people. That takes some courage, and I respect he and Nye for putting their mouth where their money is.**


&gt;1) Radiometric dating of rocks is solid, irrefutable science.


**Radiometric dating is extrapolation to the extreme, and extrapolation, by its very nature carries higher levels of uncertainty the further out you go. To say this is irrefutable is either highly disingenuous, or incredibly naive.**


&gt;The agreement between different isotopes with overlapping time spans is so strong, it is impossible for anyone to wriggle out of the conclusion that the world is billions of years old, not thousands.


**The agreement is very strong, if you accept his unprovable assumptions. There are YECs and OECs, but a naturalist cannot objectively consider any alternatives to an old earth, because it is completely incompatible with darwinian evolution, which their whole system of philosophy rests on. They have much more at stake than creationists do, and you can tell by their unwavering dogmatic commitment to mathematically ambiguous science.**


&gt;Astronomical evidence of the expanding universe agrees.


**So long as you accept more unprovable assumptions.**


&gt;2) But although there are gaps in the fossil record, it is a very telling fact that not a single fossil has ever been found in the wrong place in the time sequence. To paraphrase JBS Haldane, not a single fossil rabbit has ever been found in the Precambrian.


**I should hope not! If evolution is good science, then it adapts to the evidence, and finding evidence of an ""out of place"" fossil would require them to change their model accordingly. That's not to say there are not anomalies, such as an entire category of ""living fossils"", which are very difficult for the evolutionist to explain, but quite easy for the creationist. The irony here is that Dawkins seems ignorant of the creationist explanations for fossil order, and assumes that he has the only tenable explanation. Just like any good science, creationists have built a model to explain why the fossils are in the order they're in, so by their estimations, no fossils are out of place either. But I highly doubt that Nye will want to go anywhere near gaps in the fossil record as they relate to the Precambrian.**


&gt;3) Today we can add comparative molecular sequences (DNA and proteins) which are even more convincing, by orders of magnitude. Whichever molecule you look at, and whichever bone system etc you look at, the pattern of animal resemblances turns out to be the same branching tree (given normal, expected margins of error). What could that branching tree be but a pedigree, a family tree, a tree of descent with modification?


**This is hilarious. DNA evidence has completely uprooted the standard phylogenic tree of life model and forced secular scientists to scramble for a new model that is much more web-like than tree-like. The fact that some animals are similar to other animals and that proves evolution would be like arguing that Ford and Mercury make similar Sedans, so one must have evolved from the other. Obviously, if they had the same designers, that would explain the similarity just as well. Dawkins should know better, but his minions probably don't.**


&gt;4) The pattern of geographical distribution of animals and plants is exactly as it should be, on the assumption that slow, gradual evolution has taken place on slowly drifting (plate tectonics) continents and islands.


**Again with the, ""exactly as it should be"" business. If your evolutionary model is based on the evidence, then the evidence should fit your model. But does he know how creationists account for this same evidence and how well it fits their model? A horse and a kangaroo come off the ark. The horse goes north, the kangaroo goes south. Later, such as in the ""days of Peleg"", the continents are divided and populations become isolated. Geographic distributions of life are not remotely problematic for creationists.**


&gt;5) It’s never ideal to argue from authority, but the fact is that the VAST majority of scientists working in relevant fields accept the fact of evolution and the fact that the universe is billions of years old.


**And at one time the VAST majority of doctors believed that blood letting and laying with snakes would heal you. It's not surprising that naturalists are drawn to science and make up a large number of them, because in their worldview, that's all there is. For the rest of us, there are a good number of other endeavors that we consider just as worthy of our time and effort. This is a textbook argumentum ad populum fallacy, and Dawkins knows it.**


&gt;If there’s any upside to this debate, it’s that Creationists will be exposed to the words of a credible science advocate instead of the sort of fundamentalist theology they usually get inside their bubbles.''


**That is exactly the ""upside"" for Nye, and I respect his confidence. And why, if he were truly confident in his position, would Dawkins be so terrified to do the same? He loves to sit back in his ivory tower and lob darts, but will he ever come down of his throne, King of the Naturalists, and go head-to-head with anyone and prove himself? I'm not holding my breath.**"

A fringe, not at all outdated and unnecessary in the post-My Space era, hung down over his calm British eyes, as though he had never left the chaos of 2005, which I didn't remember because I was born in 1999. As I took another swig of vodka and moved to take his pants off, he chuckled, “She starts her new diet of liquor and dick.”

“Oh yeah?” I murmured gently, caressing his leg.

“Just like Hollywod, but drenched in sick.” he replied, looking out the window.

“The sun goes down, and so does she.” Oli sighed as the fun really started.

I think he saved my life at least five times that night, and every time as he'd get hard again mumble “and the snake starts to sing”. I knew what he'd been through – it had been a season of suicides, and he thought the sadness would never end. But just as he was about to go the next morning, he gave me a little kiss and said “Chelsea, smile.”

I obeyed and he gave me some of the best advice I've ever gotten.

“There is a hell, believe me, I've seen it. There is a heaven, let's keep it a secret.”

“Wow.” I replied, “That would make a great unnecessarily long album title! But do you think you'll fail horribly at trying to be post-rock again?”

He winked “I've got a secret, it's on the tip of my tongue, it's on the back of my lungs. And I'm gonna keep it. I know something you don't know.”

As he turned to go, he leaned in for one last word, “Tell Slater not to wash his dick.”"

I guess I'm suggesting a way of thinking about the trade system that could provide the foundation for a future redesign in which historical mono-directional trade flows aren't hard-coded in, but would emerge as a result of (and feed back to affect) military power, culture, and technology differentials. Thus, if you played a kick-ass game as the Cherokee, you could presumably make some value-added products to get bi-directional flow going instead of just exporting raw materials to Europe and having to purchase value-added products from them, which I presume is what the directional trade flow represents."

&gt;Guys in their 30s do not have a small dating pool. For every 30-something single man, there should be *about* one 30-something single woman (not exactly, since people pair off with folks older/younger). 

As a guy in my 30s, I am only speaking from experience. It's a small dating pool. I don't know what it's like to be a woman in her 30s dating and do not want to try and speak as if I know what it's like. I would be interested in hearing from a 30-something, single woman speak from huias is perspective though.

&gt;You write as though single 30-something men are totally functional and baggage-free while it's just the women who are problematic.

I'm sorry if it came out that way. Didn't mean to imply that.

Aikido: Far too contrived, and almost exclusively based on fighting untrained fighters who put all their momentum into their attacks. It is extremely good at taking down someone who does not see it coming, be it a wrist grab or a swing, but falls apart once the first technique has ended.

I believe the use of nuclear weapons against a large civilian population (yes, they had some military significance but the civilians took the brunt of it) was a cowardly act. Same with the fire bombing of Tokyo. I also believe that the same applies to the Japanese actions in Nanking. Really anything the same where civilians are specifically targeted.

I also believe that the drone strikes should be ended and used against purely military targets **only**, which means known encampments, bases, etc. Drones should not be subject to the ""collateral damage"" casualties that large bombing campaigns have the tendency to do.

blackpony04,AdviceAnimals,1390099888.0,"Okay, but is it wrong to keep a company viable in a time of war or is it really war profiteering? 

From that Wiki link: *While the plant was effectively cut off from Coca Cola headquarters during the war, plant management did not join the Nazi Party. After the war, the Coca Cola corporation regained control of the plant, formula and the trademarks to the new Fanta product — as well as the plant profits made during the war.*

With that you can argue that the direction of the companies in the Axis countries were acting entirely on their own and not at the behest of their parent/HQ and to the victors went the spoils. I'm not saying they didn't then profit from the war but what were they supposed to do about their foreign plants in enemy territory?"

So the U.N slowly took away privaleges of the arabs that had lived their before this new establishment.

Omega037,changemyview,1390100451.0,"&gt; how is a new company going to form in this area?

New companies can and do easily form.  Have you never heard of ""organic"" farming?  Not to mention that farmers can just convert their harvested crop into seed and sell it locally/regionally if they want, it just isn't usually worth it for them to do so usually.

Really, this is a bad area for you to try and make your point about monopolies because farmers are fairly autonomous and do have a lot of decisions they can make.

As for market share, that is only referring to a couple of crops (corn and soybeans) and farmers can choose to grow different crops if they want.

Beyond that though, your whole point is disingenuous.  Having two companies control 50% of the market share doesn't mean anything if the market is very large and there are many other companies in the other 50%.  

It isn't like there is some kind of ""majority rules"" that happens and it is common to see this kind of distribution of share.  The two best have a proportionally large share, while tens or hundreds of smaller companies can still be profitable and attempt to dethrone the top ones.

However, completely playing devil's advocate here: 

First of all, number of citable publications is not a good gauge to evaluate research productivity. Why? Because of this erroneous notion that people have that more papers = more productive as well as more citations of the paper = a better or higher quality paper. That is simply not true. Most of those rankings by publication output (not sure about the one you linked but the others have fallen for this) include papers that are not in open-access and not peer reviewed journals. [Noble prize winner Randy Schekman puts it much more succinctly than I can.]
(http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/how-journals-nature-science-cell-damage-science) 


But other than Times, [KAUST's world ranking according to QS, which used to do the rankings for Time magazine before 2010 ranks KAUST research as high as Yale and University of Michigan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QS_World_University_Rankings)

One could also argue that these universities are still relatively new and have a low number of students and faculty. For example, KAUST was only established in 2009 and has about just starting out 1200 PhD students from over 60 countries. 

I did not know about the part-time hiring scandal so thanks for that  but a completely nonsense statement one can make to argue your point is that KSU did what they did to get on the map and be able to attract high caliber student and faculty.

Anyways, it is an interesting topic. I still disagree with you however. Currently gulf universities definitely are not as high ranking as well as established universities around the world, but I really do believe that what they are doing is at the very least a step in the right direction. 

Edit: Sorry if the structuring and such sucks, I wrote it at 3 AM"

Vroonkle,AskReddit,1390100585.0,"Former EMS volunteer (EMT intermediate):  
Called to a home of a man reporting severe intestinal pain, and an inability to move/walk. He presented his symptoms as though he was having unexplainable intestinal cramps, and couldn't move. We load him up, take him to the hospital, our shift ends in route, so we go grab dinner in the cafeteria. After dinner, I asked a nurse (out of curiosity) if they figured out this dudes problem. I have never struggled so hard not to laugh at someone's stupidity in my life: 

This dude put a candle in his ass while masturbating. At some point he contracted his rectum, and basically sucked this candle up into his colon. This was a long dinner table sort of candle (I got to see the x-rays), tapered and round on both ends. He tried to use BARBECUE TONGS to remove the candle. He pushed the candle higher, and higher, and apparently thought the best move would be to get the tongs above the candle. The tongs also fell victim to the man's vacuum like anus. This dude could not walk because he put a set of 10"", spring loaded, metal barbecue tongs into his ass. 

This is still my favorite story of all time. "

lalie,TwoXChromosomes,1390100674.0,"I can get easier once you're out of the house.  I learned so many fucked up coping mechanisms and interpersonal skills growing up as the child of an alcoholic, and it took me interacting with people who weren't alcoholics on a daily basis and being out of the alkie environment to even start to fix that.  

I was extremely manipulative, quick to anger, all that stuff.  Once you realize that not everyone is out to hurt you, it gets easier.  I'd recommend therapy, if you can afford it.  I never thought of my childhood as difficult, until I went to a therapist and she was legitimately shocked by some of the shit I shared with her.  She also helped me to recognize and deal with some of the personality traits I have as an ACOA.

Your awareness of it is a good start.  Just know that as an ACOA, you will always be at risk of developing alcoholism yourself, or getting into extremely co-dependant relationships.  Being self-aware is one of the best things you can do to try to mitigate that.

Also, it's not ""putting up with it"" - it's fucking *surviving*.  You do what you gotta do to get through this and get to a better place in *your* life.  I recently had to move back in with my parents due to unemployment, and it's hell, but it makes sense for *my* life and *my* needs right now.

BrooksConrad,AskReddit,1390100872.0,"Picture the scene:

You're at the Grand Canyon, at its widest expanse. The noonday sun is beating down on you, the warm air blasting against your face as it flows up over the lip of the canyon. And what a canyon it is, a vast wound in the earth, gaping before you. Just being near it gives you a giddy thrill, like maybe if you stepped over the edge, you could fly...

Straying towards the chasm, you notice something's amiss, an oddity in the sparse environs of your surroundings. Someone's built a ramp, of all things, on the opposite side of the canyon. It's a slapdash-looking thing, all joists and exposed nails, but what really draws your eye is the masses of TNT strapped beneath it. Dynamite, C4, plastic explosive - the whole nine yards. Someone *really* wants this ramp to go up with a bang.

Looking beyond the ramp, you see a cloud of dust being kicked up in the distance - the only spark of movement in this arid desert. Something out there is seriously booking it. Straining your eyes and ears, you pick up a faint roaring in the distance, the deep-throated growl of a powerful petrol engine going flat-out. The speck leading the cloud comes into view, and you let out an appreciative whistle.

The dust cloud is the wake of a 1968 Dodge Charger, racing towards the canyon as though outrunning the hounds of Hell. It's not having an easy run, because every spare inch of the car's interior is packed with plastic explosives. As the car powers towards the edge, and the ramp, you catch a glimpse of the driver: It's me. With the detonator in one hand and a cigar in my mouth, I am flooring the accelerator and urging my chariot towards the ramp like a demented Evel Knievel.

The end, when it comes, is abrupt: The Dodge gives a final roar as its wheels mount the ramp, and manic laughter fills the air as I pop the cap on the detonator. The back wheels clear the ramp as I stab my thumb down. The Dodge hangs in the air for a split-second, a moment frozen in time: Then the explosives erupt, and *my ascent into Heaven is GLORIOUS.*"

SophieT,asktransgender,1390100965.0,"Hey Kimi,

Congrats on being able to be yourself, it looks like it has been a really tough journey for you and from the sound of things you are going to be a lot happier now! :)  I really liked the letter, it read well and besides a few tiny details and a couple of things that sprang to my mind it was concise and to the point without being boring or long winded.  I've pointed out some small grammatical or spelling errors, please excuse my extreme pickiness on that and my extreme Englishness on the grammar ;)

Some people may not understand the word dysphoria.  Whenever I was explaining it I did use it but I explained it as a discomfort or disconnect from who I was inside to what I looked like outside.  Obviously feel free to explain it any way you choose or you may just have very well educated extended family :)

&gt;'To have Genitals that feels beyond weird.'  

I'd either add 'male' to this and cut the 'that', or make the addition and add a comma to break it up after 'Genitals'.

'Nauseas' is Nauseous :)

Not sure what a Matric farewell is, Google did let me know, I'm guessing your extended family will too!

Endocrine may be another of the slightly too medical phrases to spring on people.

&gt;'I am starting to feel comfortable with myself, when I look in the mirror it’s not as bad as it used to be, but it is still allot better'.
  
You could rephrase that as you said the same thing twice :)  

&gt;'But above all, this is the part I want people to understand the most. This is the part where I’m going to be emphatic, where I’m going to be angry, and where I’m probably going to cry a little. **This is the part where I want to make clear that this was not a choice. I did not  decide to become a girl.** This is me allowing myself to be who I am, and it is the only route that I can take, because I am done lying and acting about who I am.'
 
I like this because it's very strong and you use the right words to get that across.  The only thing I would suggest is that you might want to say that this is not about choosing to be a girl or boy, merely showing who you are in the first place.  The way it read (to me at least!) is that transition is not even a choice you are making.  I've rewritten my explanation a few times and its still a bit confusing but I'm basically saying that you are choosing to be happy and live your life rather than going with the status quo and what people expect that you should do.  That **IS** a choice but it's not a choice about who you are, just a choice about life.

&gt;'I’m going to go into debt for hundreds thousands in medical bills'.

Hundreds OF thousands?  Not sure about your currency so that might be true.

&gt;'A lot of my is changing and will continue to change'.
 
Missing word there :)

&gt;'I will never dress like a boy for anything or anyone. I will not stand for any slurs, you can call me a girl/woman or when you really need to refer to me as a trans woman. Don’t ever out me to anyone, not co-workers not friends, especially not prayer groups/friends since most trans murders are religiously motivated, please don’t risk my life for your comfort.'

This is fine to say but I may soften it as it clashes somewhat with what you wrote afterwards about being something you hadn't been through before either.  People will make mistakes and it sounds like you are cool with that so long as they aren't being asshats about it or using you like a piece of gossip.  This sounds far more like laying down the law when you might not need to so directly.  Saying you're not going to take any shit is fine, telling people how they will act may put some backs up unnecessarily.  And to those who might be put out anyway, don't give them the ammunition to say you are wrong about anything you've said!

&gt;'I can’t ask for acceptance from everyone. I don’t even really expect it.'

This is saying that some of them are assholes.  They might be but I'd skip it, the rest of the letter has a lovely and non judgmental tone :)

&gt;'If you don’t want to speak to me anymore at all, that’s okay too.'
 
Repetition, you said it earlier in that paragraph and I wouldn't reinforce *that* particular thought ;)

&gt;'Some of you on the fringes of my life and will probably just brush this off as a strange occurrence involving a person you barely ever meet, mostly due to my fault for pulling back from friends and family. But I hope that this wont happened.'

I really liked this paragraph because it shows that you understand for some people it won't be a big deal because you don't know each other well!  I may change the first phrase from 'Some of you on the fringes of my life' to something like 'Some of you see me very infrequently' and the last sentence simply needs the 'ed' removed from the end :)

I find a lot of people associate transgenderism with three major areas, sexuality, outright freakishness and mental health issues (from what I have seen of the uninformed).  You may want to cover the differences between how you feel as a transexual and how crossdressers and drag queens feel (i.e. no gender discomfort, acting a persona or simply like the clothes and the femininity).  I'm not saying in any way that crossdressing is wrong but alot of people simply think the whole idea is that you simply want to dress like that.  I know you mentioned some of this but it might be worth spelling out the differences as I've seen a lot of people take that path mentally.  People also love to think that it has something to do with your sexuality and whereas I liked the part where you said you were starting to feel sexual interest for the first time it may be worth stating that this has nothing to do with who you love.  In time you MAY find that your orientation changes but it really doesn't have anything to do with being transgender and is not what you are setting out to do or make up for.  Finally, some people see it as you just getting a sexual kick out of it.  I think you've covered that pretty well but it may be worth keeping in mind :)

You may want to mention it will take some years to complete and could involve surgery just to give people a sense of the time scale.

You can add the facts at the end and I know its good to be able to show the reality but I might leave them off.  If you have been unfortunate to experience any of the bottom section I'd mention it possibly in the main body above as a different paragraph on how difficult it is but bulletting it at the bottom feels disconnected to the rest and you write well so I think you could make it feel more connected to you personally in normal prose :)

I wish you all the very best hon and I hope you'll get the support you deserve.  Alot people find close family the most difficult and extended the best, if you've already got your close families support then you're well ahead of the game!

All the best,

Sophie x

Clockw0rk,AskReddit,1390101040.0,"Distraction.

I have a backlog of movies to watch, shows to catch up on, video games to play. Some backlogs have grown so unruly I've just given them up as lost causes. Comics? Used to be into them, now there's too many for me to follow, so I don't. The sheer amount of things I could do, at any given time, at my house for no additional money and minimal effort is HUGE. 

So, any time I have feelings of loneliness, I distract myself with something. Since acquiring new things is part of my monthly routine, I never run out of things to do. The endless project treadmill fills up time and worry. I don't ever have to think of opportunities I'm missing out on or things that would be fun with others because I have a seemingly endless library of shit I can do by myself.

The psychology of it is almost baffling. Because any new piece of media I get just gets thrown into the backlog, I have little to no impetus to do it immediately, which somehow lessens the acknowledgement of any financial backing to the endless hobby spiral. Ten bucks here, twenty bucks there.. I spend less than 100 bucks a month on entertainment, yet because the backlog is so vast and any new additions just blend into a seemingly insurmountable pile, I often don't think of how I could be spending my time or money anywhere else."

I'm getting it from you.  You claim the man isn't wearing pants.  That's ridiculous, he is wearing pants -- they're just not drawn because its a fucking stick figure, and if you weren't being a deliberately obtuse idiot, you would have already figured that out.

But no, you had to play dumb, and claim that the man symbol isn't wearing pants.  Which means you're establishing that any item of clothing not actually drawn on a stick figure is absent, which means the man is also not wearing a shirt.  It also means the woman is not wearing a shirt.

Scandalous!

And I'm not just talking about the various family members or coworkers that take time off from trying to set you up with that nice girl from down the way/cute girl from Accounting/some hot chick at the party last night in order to loudly wonder if you're still watching those strange cartoons from someplace foreign. I admit, those people are annoying. But they aren't nearly as annoying as an anime fan of a certain caliber.

We all know the types. They complain about moe. They complain about stereotypes. They lovingly detail every single trope whose merest mention inside of a show will force them to drop it immediately, and then they will complain about it to everyone they can trap inside of a steel box for long enough to get them to listen. Then, in between all of the other complaints just so they never waste a merest moment in between complaints, they complain about anything ever produced by Key or KyoAni like they were the harbingers of the apocalypse. 

I hate these people, and their constant yammering is more annoying than anything else. Ever. If I could figure out a way to get them all to shut the hell up, I'd be a happy man.

And the strawman arguments are insufferable. 

And the way they conflate the views of completely different groups! I remember one post that got right to the top of the sub that was somebody saying something to the effect of ""maybe there are less female scientists because women like science less."" The person never identified themselves as a feminist in the post, or anywhere else on their blog - the blog was mostly pictures of anime characters and baked goods - but the whole thread on /r/tumblrinaction was about ""feminist hypocrisy.""  Several people pointed that out, but those comments were mostly ignored cause they didn't fit with the circlejerk.

And they're such dicks to people who identify as asexual and demisexual and stuff like that. And to anyone who's gender-nonconforming but not transgender - and there are pretty frequently some less overt but still present transphobic tones to the conversation too.

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1390101751.0,"Right now, unless you are getting a discount when you pay in bitcoin, it is better to use your credit card.  In fact, unless you are an early miner and have 1000's of Bitcoin you'd like to start unloading, there is more market incentive to hold your Bitcoin than to use it for purchases.  For merchants, there are great incentives to accept BTC payments.

The key is, at some point in the future (which is what we care about), there will be good reasons to use Bitcoin as a form of payment.  Imagine if credit card companies started accepting BTC to pay off credit card bills. Imagine if other bills, such as utility or mortgage could be paid with BTC.  If this type of future ever becomes a reality, you will have wished you had purchased BTC before it became so widely adopted.

But Gay Josh was just ambivalent about that nickname.  My college roommate *adored* his (very possibly self-applied) nickname of ""Gator"" which apparently had something to do with his ability to eat pussy.

http://www.rabbit.org/care/babies.html

There is a section about it here in the ""Are the babies in danger,"" section.

*Sometimes a mother rabbit will accidentally injure the kits because her nails have never been clipped, the nest box is not proper, or she is stressed and skittish by too much activity around her. It is possible, if she is housed outdoors, that neighborhood predators, such as feral cats, raccoons or fox, are causing her anxiety at night. 

*If the mother seems to be cannibalizing the nestlings, nutritional deficiencies are but one of the possible scenarios. It is normal for these vegetarian animals to eat the afterbirth, as it is for most other mammals. It prevents predators from discovering the nest and provides the mother which some much-needed nutrients. 

* Also to note, first time mothers might not have realized they have become mothers.

There is more varied information out there for this issue.  There is no psychological deciding factor of, ""Hey, I'm a bunny and want to kill my babies.""  It's often a sign of fear, stress, nutritional issues, or inexperience.

As far as people from your work finding out, I'm a big fan of ""It's only as awkward as you make it"". Online dating is *very* common these days - and there is no shame in it. 

If someone asks if you're on OkCupid because X said you were, just say 'Yeah, I've been using it to meet new people and I'm having a really good time'. If you're confident about it, no one is going to tease you.

tzivje,running,1390102346.0,"Everyone starts somewhere. 

I have been running 8 years. When I first started, I could barely go 5 minutes without feeling like I had been hit by a truck, completely doubling over in agony. But I kept at it. 

At first my goal was to get out for 20 minutes every other day. The only gear I used was a stopwatch. I would go and stop whenever I felt like it. But I would also stop the clock whenever I wasn't running. As long as I got 20 minutes of solid running time in, I was happy.

Within a couple months, I upped my time to 30 minutes, and would stop every 10 minutes for a breather.

A couple years ago, my standard became 50 minutes. Sometimes I would still stop every 10-20 minutes, sometimes I would go the entire 50 minutes without rest. Now my minimum run is 50 minutes, and on a good day I'll get 90 in. Every day is different. Sometimes I'll stop for a few seconds here and there, but mostly I try to keep my pauses for when I hit traffic lights.

So just keep doing whatever your body is comfortable with. As long as you make a point of getting out to run on a regular basis, and push yourself just a little more each time, you will no doubt improve your endurance!

Also, give yourself a new small, manageable goal each time you go out. An extra 5 minutes of running. Only stopping for a quick breather after you have put in a minimum amount of time. Only stop at traffic lights. Choose a landmark to run to, and don't stop until you get there. I still do that kind of thing all the time, just to keep myself going and feeling challenged. It's kind of a game, in a way, and makes running more interesting, especially as a beginner.

Happy running!"

ZenDragon,feedthebeast,1390102536.0,"For any kind of block with an inventory interface, OpenPeripherals has the methods **getStackInSlot()**, **pullIntoSlot()**, **pushIntoSlot()**, and **swapStacks()**.

The first one, getStackInSlot(), returns data about a stack of items in a specific slot, as an array. It takes a slot number as an argument. Most of the mod developers were smart and kind enough to arrange slots in their interfaces so that they start with either zero or one at the top-left and continue in a logical reading order. Might take some trial and error to map everything out though. There's no documentation about which slots correspond to which indices for every kind of inventory OpenPeripherals supports.

The next two methods should be pretty self explanetory at this point. They each take a slot number as an argument.

The last method takes two slot numbers.

Edit: Oh and don't forget this step if you're not accustomed to OpenPeripherals:

    local cobbleChest = peripheral.wrap(""left"")
    // where ""cobbleChest"" could be any name you want,
    // and ""left"" is the side of the turtle it's adjacent to.

On a sidenote, the fracture there looks like a clean break, and is semi-far from the 'hot zone' of the bowl, might I recommend some steel epoxy adhesive? I used JB-Weld for many many years, and actually ran a sort of restore&amp;repair shop while I was in school. just mix a pea sized amount on some paper, and use a toothpick to apply to the break. I had a bowl that I repaired several times that way, each time it would break it would be in a different spot, leading to a whole new pattern on the glass just from the weld xD

The thing with cold steel is once it cures, its HARD, and to date remains the only adhesive I've used that was effective in welding glass back together. Its also the only adhesive that can get fairly warm without emitting any sort of fumes, leaving you with a clean smoke almost as good as the day you bought it."

You might think, ""Oh, well, then stop taxing me to give their workers welfare, because then they'd find a better job,"" but it doesn't work that way.

Read up on the history of factory labor and union formation. The movements are primarily to prevent the workers from becoming financially enslaved and without the ability to afford food and housing. You might think it's good that the movements happened due to the companies being too evil, but the problem is that thousands upon thousands had to die and starve and such to get those benefits.

You're an aggro deck. You rely on being fast. If it's that prevalent of an issue that you're getting outraced by a midrange deck, then you need to figure out how to smooth out your mana issues, or you need to try a different deck, because a consistently slow aggro deck is going to get railed.

On the other hand, if the deck can consistently curve out, or come close, and you just drew a couple bad hands. That happens sometimes, variation is still part of the game. But you're playing aggro. You're the beatdown. You're the bully. You dictate the pace, especially against a deck with no verdict. They drop a pack rat, you should have a voice or fleecemane on the table. If they propogate, then they don't remove your creature, and your creature is bigger, and you can play another one, or a smiter on turn three.

fefebee,TheLastAirbender,1390102955.0,"Dude, to get my boyfriend into watching avatar, I just watched it around him all the time.

He ended up really liking it and eventually watched all of Korra with me!

He also had the argument against watching it because he didn't like cartoons. I had to explain to him that cartoons like avatar - the medium of how the story is told does not effect the integrity of the story. like he'll watch shows like Archer or South Park, cartoony and animated, and would still enjoy them. He had it in his mind that cartoons are meant for kids or to be funny. If she can sit and watch a series and follow the story, she can sit and watch avatar.

 If you have clean breaks on fairly intact, large chunks of glass, I recommend using some JB-Weld to repair. It is, to date, the only adhesive/cold weld product I tell people to use, and is the only cold-weld I have ever found to be truly effective. It won't fume under heat, it holds glass together like as if the break never happened, and if you do a bit of careful wiping and cleaning while the weld cures, it actual weld itself is usually pretty hard to see.

If all is lost, then I pay my respects to your glass. May it rest in peaceful pieces, and smoke never ending bowls in its afterlife."

Megawatts19,AskReddit,1390103436.0,"This one is a song for me. It's not really a sad song, but it gets me everytime. First off, a little backstory.

I was in the top of my class all throughout high school. I had high expectations surrounding me when I graduated. I was in line to become the first from my family to go to college. I was always a smart kid. Then, after a year of college, I flunked out. Truth is I never wanted to be there. I went to make my parents happy. They were so proud to see me in college. To know their boy could have a chance at a better life than they did.

Now, I'm working a steady job learning a trade, and, while I'm happy, I still think sometimes how things would be different if I would have gotten my degree.

There's a song by Montgomery Gentry called ""Something to be Proud of"". It talks about how life doesn't often go the way you want it to. There's a verse that always makes me breakdown because I can see my father saying these things to me:

I fell in love next thing I know
The babies came and the car got sold.
I sure do miss that old hot rod
But you sure save gas in them foreign cars
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down
If you're ashamed of how I turned out
Well he lowered his voice and he raised his brow.
He said son let me tell you right now.
That's something to be proud of.
That's a life you can hang your hat on
You don't need to make a million
Just be thankful to be working
If you're doing what you're able
Putting food there on the table
And providing for the family that you love
That's something to be proud of."

Cis is shorter to type than normal for one thing. Second, would you normal instead of white? Normal instead of straight? Normal instead... you get the point.

Indeed. You can't blame a person's weight on one thing. Hank Green's video on the subject is pretty great.

I've been diagnosed with Asperger's for all of my life so I know what you mean with the ""neurotypical is condensing"". I prefer allistic. Words are useful though as long as they are used in a neutral or positive way.

Thank you, when I get money I will be sure to donate. :) Sadly just by saying that I will be less likely to donate so I'll push myself hard to remember to do so.

Genderqueer doesn't mean you aren't masculine or feminine. It just means you don't experience gender in a way that can be easily grouped with the labels ""male"" and ""female"". I doubt genderqueer people would be doing it for attention when genderqueer people are more likely targets of violence than binary trans people. Face more shaming than binary trans people. Face more restroom dysphoria than binary trans people.

Fat people are shamed. They are more likely to be bullied. They are more likely to be called ugly. It is still acceptable to call people fatphobic slurs. Etc.

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1390103533.0,"I was born with ambiguous genitalia, when I was 2 years old my Grandmother (a nurse) encouraged my father to get it surgically 'feminised'.

The surgery was very well done and I 'grew into' my clitoris, and I never knew anything was different. I had vulvodynia from a very young age so I spent a lot of time looking at my vulva trying to work out why it hurt. I knew vulva's came in all shapes and sizes and that mine looked healthy, But I had 5 lips instead of 4, and that odd 5th one was 8cm longer than the others. It ran from under my clitoris, to my vaginal opening, Right down the centre. I spent ages looking for my urethra but never could find it.

That 5th lip got stuck in everything, it made wearing tight knickers hard, it made wearing jeans painful. I thought it was the source of all my pain, so at 16 I talked to my GYN about getting it burnt off, like a mole.

My GYN was happy that my reasoning was non-cosmetic, and was also curious about my missing urethra. My procedure was covered on the NHS because I had already had surgury, so it was considered a procedure to fix a mistake.

I saw a urologist who found my urethra inside my vaginal opening, he confirmed that burning the 5th lip would be safe.

It was done at my local GP office, I sat on the bed in frogs pose, I got a few injections around my labia, then the doctor marked the cut with a pen, showed me in the mirror, then took off the bulk with a scalpel, then used this ball-tool thing to do the rest. He then made a cut to my hymen to expose my urethra to help avoid UTI's and Thrush.

It took about 2 months to heal fully to the point where I felt safe poking around and it was as good as I expected it to be. Recovery was tough, I had to wear a diaper to cushion it and I had to walk like a cowboy because my crotch was packed with gauze to stop things fusing together. There is no scar at all (5 years later) I can wear pants, It doesn't pull or get stuck. I still have pain but that was found to be unrelated nerve scarring and endometriosis. 

The procedure has changed a lot in the last 5 years so I can't really talk much about what *you* will feel or experience

I didn;t really have any emotional issues with my vagina, It was always pretty normal looking to me, even with the odd lip, If I had of left it I don't think anyone would of noticed or cared. Some guys might of even been happy to have that little lip to point them toward the clitoris. So my confidence hasn't really changed, but that said I felt a lot more adventurous sexually because I wasn't anxious about accidentally ripping, tearing or damaging myself.

I don't see anything physically wrong with OP's vulva, it looks nice to me, But I totally understand how annoying it can be to have asymmetry, it gets in the way physically, and in OP's case it is having a pretty big emotional impact too. Surgery isn't the only option, There are options involving body acceptance therapy, exposure therapy, support groups and more that you can do instead, or do in the meantime. 

[this](http://documentarystorm.com/the-perfect-vagina/) is a really good documentary on the subject and it shows a few alternatives. 

This is an expensive procedure if you can't get it done on an NHS type program, If you don't have to get it, don't. Recovery is not guaranteed, I was lucky, but the surgery can cause nerve damage, which can reduce your ability to enjoy sex or even reach orgasm. Because the vulva is a hot, moist area, Wounds sometimes don't heal, and infection is a huge risk. some people call their vulva's ""an axe wound"" or a ""slash"" or a ""wound that never healed"" as a slang term, But you really don;t want that to become a reality. Its about the pros and cons. You need a surgeon you can trust, and you need to spend a long time talking about the procedure. 

If you know its going to take a few years to save up, spend those years talking to doctors and  finding out more so that when you have the money you wont have to wait, you know what it involves, you know what to do.

**tl;dr:** Start your research now (like you are doing) Before you get labiaplasti you should know enough about it to almost be qualified to do it yourself. I recommend you watch [this](http://documentarystorm.com/the-perfect-vagina/)  because it can show you some good body-positive things to do in the meantime and hear a bit about other women who are having it. The documentary sort of aims to talk you out of it, which is why its good to watch, If you watch it and still feel confident you want one, you know its *you* who is making that decision. "

I_Am_Okonkwo,LongDistance,1390103868.0,"[Intro]

Oh my God, I see you clearly now

I’m in love with someone out of town

In my dreams, you're here with me somehow

I'm in love with someone out of town


[Verse 1: XV]

It's like I'm everywhere you're not at

So you're disrobing all your clothing while you open up your skype chat

And I was shooting for your heart when we had aim

When I quit Target cause my target was the rap game

I always said my first love gets my last name

But I know this long road drives you insane

But just know: I will never go from tinman to scarecrow

Trading in my heart just to get brain

And you're a hell of a drug, I'm on my Rick James

Turn you to a Super Freak when I spit game

But you still feel alone

Cause you want to put your head on my chest, not your ear to the 
phone

Lay down, put me in your ear

Describe your mood and the things you wear

Got me thinking damn, girl, I need you here

She said, ""I'm about to come"", and I said, ""See you... there""

And she goes...


[Hook: Raja]

She sings her favorite song

She sings it all alone

They see it in her eyes

She does it every night

Cause she plays my song 'til her heart beats like drums for me


[Verse 2: XV]

Let my heart be a state, my soul be a city

And we're on the same block cause your time zone's Vizzy

And I know them other girls seem pretty

But when you do it big, there are just so... many

So I would never do it just to lose it

Do my eyes seem foolish? If I try, say you want it

Put a nine with a bullet, to my mind and just pull it

Cause I'd have to be blind on my side, Sandra Bullock

My phone jail broken, that's a cell with no bars

And I don't even know where I are

Trying to get some cut, you want to get lit

So I'm talking shit like a barber at a bar

Niggas ask, ""Where your man?"", you say, ""Very far""

They ask for direction, you point to the stars

So much space in between the space bar

Fuck it, tell them, ""Clear the way, I'm about to take off""

And she goes...

[Hook]

[Bridge: XV]

Put on your iTunes and sing for me

Spray my cologne and put on my T for me

When I'm gone, I know you dream of me

(Her heart beats like drums for me)

Put on your iTunes and sing for me

Spray my cologne and put on my T for me

Put your titties up on the screen for me

When I'm gone, I know you dream of me

karhall,ElderScrolls,1390103910.0,"Ok, first of all, I'm glad you decided to be so hostile about this, because it makes it easier for me to feel more confident in my opinion.

And stop putting words in my mouth. I never told the people who post these threads to ""fuck off,"" I suggested they try using /r/nextelderscrolls. I'm purposefully being courteous about this whole process because I knew people would be upset about the subject, and you're only re-enforcing my suspicions. I'm allowed to say that I find the discussions lacking, but I never said they were ""piss poor."" I suggested that some more thought might be put into them, is all.

* * *

I could take every word you're saying and apply it back to you; this thread *is* related to Elder Scrolls, specifically TES: VI, so I'm allowed to be here. You said it yourself:
&gt; no one has a right to tell anyone part of TES is okay and what part isn't.

If I'm guilty of this, you are guilty to the same extent.

You being up in arms about my opinion is contrary to the point you are trying to make. I'm just trying to wrap *my* head around why *you* think *you* have the right to tell *me* to stop voicing *my* opinion. If you want me to just ""downvote and move on"" from the TES: VI threads, couldn't you just do the same with this one?

* * *

Touching on the rest of your comment, I have yet to see a high-effort text post regarding TES: VI. Somewhere else in this thread there was an example of the usual posts on the topic. In essence, here is what I've seen:

&gt; **WHAT DOES EVERYONE THINK WILL HAPPEN IN ELDER SCROLLS 6?**
&gt; 
&gt; I think Elder Scrolls 6 will be set in Summerset Isles. What do you think?

And that's that. I have yet to see an OP outline their idea further. Even in the comments there is often little more fleshing out of ideas and opinions. Some of the highest rated comments are regularly nothing more than ""Black Marsh"" or ""I want Elsweyr."" If that's not low-quality I'll eat my hat.

I never said that this is what TES: VI threads will *always be,* not in the slightest. I think that with some time and effort a good TES: VI thread can be produced from anyone at any moment, and I have no problem with that; in fact, I invite that to happen, I want that to happen, I *need* that to happen. I want to talk about TES: VI, just like all of you. It's hard to do so when there is so little being offered, and that is where part of my frustration comes from.

I also assume you all are a creative bunch, and there are plenty of things that can be discussed that are not ""fresh and new."" It just takes effort. I assume anyone here would be willing to put in some effort for a good discussion, judging by how vehemently you are opposing my suggestion that I don't find the effort to be substantial enough for my tastes.

* * *

If you still think I'm wrong, and you wish to prove me wrong, I ask that you do something to prove me wrong. If you think you can create a solid TES: VI post that will silence me forever, do it. I believe it can be done, and I think you can do it. You seem to believe in yourself enough. Please, prove me wrong."

I ended up getting my period before that and it was the most painful cramping I'd ever had. My Mom was considering taking me to the ER and said I looked like I was about to pass out. 

Talked to my doc and she said that occasionally the uterus lining can take longer to shed and that it took more 'pushing out' from my body than usual. She gave me pain meds and let me be.

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1390103974.0,"In Australia Ablation is covered by NHS, and its very common place to have it done after you have completed your family and if you are having menstrual issues. 

I had one done at 17, It's very rare for it to happen that young, But I had been bleeding non-stop, heavily for 3 years, The ablation gave me 3 months blood-free, but then my period started again. (its supposed to last 5 years)

I think medically warranted hysterectomies are becoming more common, Doctors aren't waiting for it to be an emergency any more, if  the woman has a problem, and most of the other options (IUD, Ablation etc) have been trailed, and she can pay (non-issue here) they will do it.

A big issue is childfree women. I don't want kids, so I know I am going to have to wait a lot longer to get an elective hysterectomy.

However I'll find out in a month or so if that's sooner than expected. a functional MRI revealed my uterus is stuck to my bowel, so if its not salvageable, it might have to go.

You can keep the cervix and still have the uterus taken, you can also leave the ovaries. This prevents most of the issues with prolapse or induced menopause. This is what my mum did at first when she had hers, and she was very happy she did. however she had an abnormal pap-smear result a few years later and figured she would just get the cervix taken too. She regrets doing that, as a trifecta prolapse soon followed."

Let's say it'll cost them $100,000 to build an automated system and then $10,000 a month to maintain it. They still receive the same amount of payments and the amount per payment doesn't go up. The *only* saving grace they might have is that they can let go a few employees, which might save them say $6,500 a month (3 employees at $12.50 an hour). So, this new system is still costing them $3,500 **more** a month.

It's all a cost benefit analysis. The current system may be inconvenient but it *is* the system that works best for them. Trust me, if there were a better alternative, they would use it."

Again, access control mechanisms or lack thereof are largely irrelevant to authorization. You would have a great argument in your defense if you arrived at a website through google and it appeared like a publicly accessible site. You certainly would not with the ""I reverse engineered their app, and the wrote a custom app to hook up to their private backend"".

My husband and I got in a fight over basically nothing, and both ended up acting kind of like jerks.  Though, honestly, he definitely started the jerkyness.  I told him that maybe our son and I would just go stay in a hotel and he could have some time to himself to be an ass.  He said that was a great idea.  (Our son is a baby, by the way, so had no idea what was going on.)  My son and I had a thrilling time out buying curtains and dinner.  Long story short, when I got home both my husband and I were in better moods.  And he had cleaned the whole house.  Like, deeply cleaned it, which it needed.  I have been very sick and also very busy and haven't had time to help as much as usual, so things were getting pretty messy.  Later he told me that he wanted me to be able to come home to a really clean house, so he'd spent hours on it.  Oh and this is after he cleaned up my vomit, etc., for two days and took care of our boy the whole time I was stuck in bed throwing up into (and out of) a bowl.  I don't know if that's the most romantic thing ever, but the fact that a stupid fight caused him to want to make things nice for me made me feel so much love for him.

kempff,Catholicism,1390104688.0,"Naturally this begs comparison with Paul's letter to the Romans half a century earlier. Both letters had different circumstances and different agendas.

First of all, I notice that overall, the letter is devoid of anti-NewAge apologetics or condemnations. Apparently Rome didn't have a problem with them.

Ignatius does not want to be rescued from martyrdom. This is a fundamental difference from other ways of thinking that motivate people to actively seek, and in some cases materially cause, their own martyrdom. Anyone who says that all the great religions are basically the same have to account for this contrast of approaches.

Did Jesus cause, or merely allow, his own ""martyrdom""? Are we obligated to defend ourselves when wrongly accused? I wonder what Telushkin would say.

Ignatius compares himself negatively to Peter and Paul in terms of their authority. Since these men were dead but still in living memory, it makes sense that Ignatius does not appeal to the authority of their written legacy. And this proves to me Ignatius was no Protestant.

At what point does the authority of an apostle dry up and blow away? When the ink dries on an epistle? Or is the epistle merely a select reflection of ""that which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with our hands, concerning the word of life—the life was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us—that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you""? Does the living testimony, drawn from personal memory, end once it is reduced to writing?

""But if they be unwilling to assail me, I will compel them to do so."" - I have heard that some Half-Time Shows bombed because the starving lions refused to eat the Christians. That just goes to show you that both a bloody martyrdom and a martyrdom halted by the hand of God are sending the same message: that God is in control. I am reminded of Daniel's friends: ""Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king, 'O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If this be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king. But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up.'""

""I have no delight in corruptible food, nor in the pleasures of this life. I desire the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the bread of life, which is the flesh of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who became afterwards of the seed of David and Abraham; and I desire the drink of God, namely His blood, which is incorruptible love and eternal life."" - Ignatius' witness to the belief that the bread and wine shared in church services is literally Jesus makes me think either Ignatius was an arch-heretic who totally misunderstood John 6, or he was just taking it as seriously as everyone else at the time. Funny how the true meaning of the Gospel was lost for centuries and then was suddenly rediscovered lurking in scripture around the year 1500 and preserved faithfully until today (2014) when in Ignatius' time it took barely 20 years for the real meaning of John 6 to get obliterated while some of the people who literally heard Jesus speak that chapter in person may have been still alive."

If I'm not mistaken, AT&amp;T modems use phone line to connect to the wall.  You could plug a modem in to any of those phone jacks, but only one at a time.  But you couldn't plug a router into any of them, because it's a different connector (RJ45 is much larger than RJ11).  

You'll have to pick one jack to put the modem into.  Then you have a few options:

If your modem has multiple Ethernet ports:

* Run an Ethernet cable to the other computer (plug into the modem).
* Use a powerline adapter.  

If your modem only has one Ethernet port, you'll need to plug a router into it.  Then:

* Run an Ethernet cable to the original computer, and the other computer.
* Use a powerline adapter to the other computer.

I had to explore the hell out of this problem in therapy before I felt like I was even remotely able to grapple with it. You may find therapy is worth looking into.

If you're not feeling that as an option, you're still gonna be alright. No one really knows how to date, and past a certain point, no one knows what makes certain people right or not right for each other. It's much more trial and error than anyone likes to think it is. With regard to this specific dude, I'm not sure you should sleep with him yet--tell him you aren't ready, and then sleep with him when you are. If he's just using you for casual sex, he'll lose interest, fade away, and you'll be sad for a bit but you'll move on. If he isn't and he's willing to wait, that's awesome. Good luck.

Also maybe choose a different dating site, especially if you're in the UK. OKC isn't nearly as populated on your side of the pond, and it's a notorious watering hole for creepers to boot.

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1390104924.0,"&gt;Truly a mature way to prove your point there.

It was a juvenile response to a juvenile statement. You'd have to be extremely sheltered, traditionalist, isolated and honestly quite a bit delusional to think that black is a colour only for ""formal"" occasions.

&gt;Show me styles beside those that can be accurately called ""streetwear"" that manage to incorporate black meaningfully and I promise I'll consider them. But until then, the burden lies with the claimant. You claim many styles can easily have black in them.

This depends, what is your definition of streetwear?

Is [this](http://i.imgur.com/ivSVbnB.jpg) streetwear? How about [this?](http://i.imgur.com/CekxQyU.jpg) [This?](http://i.imgur.com/97rcb9E.jpg) What about [Chilljin?](http://dressed.so/user/view/chillj) He uses huge amounts of black, doesn't dress *""gothninja""* in the slightest, and you could argue his style is both ""streetwear"" and ""business casual""

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/NG41jTe.jpg) are [some](http://i.imgur.com/neiLYeD.jpg) examples of [non-""streetwear""](http://i.imgur.com/J1eZCDC.jpg) usages of black.

&gt;But honestly, the majority of people who wear black would be better suited with other colors. Especially with the styles pushed here the majority of the time, black could be replaced with gray, navy blue or other colors. As far as formality goes, I still feel black is the only color for the job.

Most people on MFA arguably wear streetwear of some form. Consider that [this](http://i.imgur.com/lVk3L1P.jpg) is a streetwear outfit- just in general these terms like ""streetwear"", ""workwear"", etc are usually pointless. Furthermore, even if these were exclusive, important terms it wouldn't change the fact that in colour theory black works well in many scenarios, and in women's fashion black is one of the most core, essential colours.

&gt;Goth ninja (or whatever it's really called--maybe avant-garde fashion or something) is the obvious exception. I know designers like Yoji have gone on record with their love of black. 

Yohji Yamamoto uses a lot of black, but he [frequently uses colour](http://care-tags.org/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=379) as well. He is also not ""Goth Ninja"" in the slightest, ""Goth Ninja"" isn't actually a real thing, nobody who dresses like that (except for *maybe* Garley) would describe themselves as a ""Goth Ninja"".

&gt;But honestly, the majority of people who wear black would be better suited with other colors. Especially with the styles pushed here the majority of the time, black could be replaced with gray, navy blue or other colors. As far as formality goes, I still feel black is the only color for the job.

The majority of people here wear ""streetwear"" or some variation these days, with bits of preppy and business casual styles sprinkled about.

&gt;If you can show me fits where black looks better, I'd concede that your view is correct. 

I made an [entire album](http://imgur.com/a/D5VUG) in another post in this thread, which includes a variety of different styles.

reginaidiotarum,SubredditDrama,1390104931.0,"Ah, but the structure allowed itself to turn into this, much like with the Tea Party take over of the Conservative party. They allowed those inside their branch to redefine the basic principals so many times that it barely resembles what it once was.

The Republican party gerrymandered the districts and created these insular conservative districts that acted as echo chambers. Suddenly conservatives weren't competing against the slightly slightly liberal but mostly moderate Democrats, but against the extremists that represent the radical extreme of what the party originally meant.

The feminist community has always presented itself as something untouchable by the other side. They fought for equal rights, specifically for women. It's hard, especially in the civil rights era to touch that. As they resolved problems, like suffrage and wage gaps the moderate and reasonable members calmed down, but the radical members stayed vocal. I think it can be said that Feminism isn't what it used to be, and only by removing the immunity that feminist thinkers get, can we restore sanity in the movement. 

It's why I claim to be an egalitarian and offer anyone to debate and dissect my writing."

IndependentBoof,Redskins,1390104972.0,"&gt; Haz' second two years in DC were marred by the cap penalty. If you pull up Skins salary distributions for the second two years (there are many sites with this data, but I'm on mobile and can't pull them), the defense and ST took the majority of the financial hit, while the offense was only lightly skimmed.

You've made that claim before but haven't substantiated it. No one was ""hit"" by the cap except special teams. We didn't lose any players because of it. Sure, we didn't get to add players on either Offense or Defense that we may have without the penalty, but no one was cut on either side -- contracts were just restructured.

&gt; So Haz may be crap, he may be competent, we don't know because all the crap I just wrote ""DQ's"" the last 4 years. But we know that now he will have all the money, tools, and authority, and time that he needs to shine...

Unfortunately, we will have to see. Even though he's never put together a good, consistent defense in all his years being a defensive coordinator -- here or elsewhere. Even when he was head coach, almost all his teams fielded sub-par defensive performance."

Multiple generations of Nintendo consoles (Gamecube, Wii, WiiU) have been ridiculed from the outside as a matter of course, yet every time they have provided a small number of excellent titles.  Going into a Nintendo purchase, most people are aware of what they're getting into.

If this doesn't excite you, then sure, sell your WiiU - but you are going to miss out on a handful of pure gems that will still be talked about in years to come, and will simply not be available anywhere else.  Wonderful 101 is one example of that kind of title.  If this appeals to you then you might want to hang on to the WiiU.  But I don't know where all this doom is coming from.

I bought the WiiU with certain expectations and they certainly haven't changed.  I couldn't give a flying shit if Activision or EA stopped publishing on WiiU.  On the off-chance that I wanted to play one of their titles I could play it literally anywhere else."

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1390105226.0,"I don't have my own story, But I would like to share my mothers (with her permission)

She had been married to my dad for 20 years, Both in their early 40's, with two children, myself, 13, and my brother, 9. 

My Dad was made redundant at work, and the company declared bankruptcy and did not pay him out. I was just starting highschool, and  recovering from jaw-surgery, My brother had just been diagnosed with atypical autism. Mum was about to go in for major surgery because of DVT in her legs, when the pre-op testing revealed she was pregnant.

At the time she had the Mirena IUD in place.

So it wasn't the *best* time to have a third child.

Mum and dad discussed it, though Dad was stubborn and wouldn't listen to options other than abortion.

Her doctors encouraged her to get the abortion. the Mirena, the DVT and my mothers age all made this a high-risk pregnancy. Because both her current children had special needs (epileptic and autistic) there were concerns that the risk of downs syndrome was very high. The abortion was covered by public healthcare due to the high-risk pregnancy and also because my mother paid for her IUD in full.

She underwent a surgical abortion at her usual women health clinic with the same GYN who gave me my D&amp;C's.

For the next 10 years she knew she had made the right decision. This was emphasised by the fact that she almost died due to her DVT.

My mother kept it a secret from us kids. I found out when I was 20. My mother was going through her official divorce from my dad (they had been sperated for years) she had lost her dad, her husband and her son was growing up, we were walking in the shopping centre and a 9 year old kid fall in front of us and scraped his knee and started crying for his mother, and my mum just broke down. It turns out she never really dealt with her true feelings on the abortion, she always blamed dad and her doctors for 'forcing' her, and she was missing her old family and wondering 'what if'

I talked to her about it, reminding her that having two kids and a mother is much better than having 3 kids and a dead mother, or 2 kids a mother and a stillborn, she was in no place to carry a child to term. That child would be 9 and watching its parents divorce, It would of been the unplanned one, and it would of known that due to the age difference. It would of had a rotten life growing up in a family that could barely support 2 kids but had 3.

I encouraged my mum to see a therapist, which she is doing for a multitude of reasons including anorexia nervosa. She's doing a lot better and coming to terms with her decision. Its hard because in 2013, her chance of surviving the pregnancy are not bad, but in 2003, the chances were a lot lower. She's struggling to see this side of things.

The way I see it. A piece of paper between two people changes nothing about their readiness to become parents. It changes nothing about their goals in life and their needs as individuals. Your reproductive system is your choice. While some people may judge you for those choices, those people don't count for anything because they are not carrying your uterus around. But just make sure that the choice you make is yours, don't let anyone else influence you, **You need to know what you are doing is right, no matter what it is you do.**"

Serae,childfree,1390105275.0,"I am married to another CF person.  The decision was made by both of us together.  Becoming parents or thinking about kids was never really part of our life plan, we just agreed that there was nothing appealing to us about having children.  

For me, I could write a book on the reasons.  I grew up in a white, middle class, American family.  I was raised by a single mother who was/is abusive.  I never played house or mom as a child.  I never said, ""Sometimes when I have kids...""  It was never really on my mind until people started asking me about it in my 20's.  Nothing about having children appealed to me.  When I played the game of life and had ""kids"" I would say, ""Oh, that's my second, third, fourth husband.""

The thought to being pregnant freaks me out.  The thought of giving birth freaks me out.  I can watch videos and talk about it, but the thought of painful things happening to MY vagina?  Nope!  

I don't want to take care of another person.  On a near daily basis I want to RAGE at my husband and our roommate because I am constantly picking up after them.  I am certain I could not cope with another person when I am half on the verge of a nervous break down over the ball-pube 'splosion that seems to happen in our bathroom every single day.  NOPE.

I like quiet.  I appreciate quiet.  Children are not always quiet.  I have been babbled to for hours on end by well behaved children and couldn't help but want to curl into a ball, plug my ears, close my eyes and void it all out.

Because of my upbringing I sometimes have pangs of (controlled and buried) rage.  I have never screamed at anyone nor risen a hand to anyone.  I don't plan on it either.  But I fear becoming my mother and that becoming a mother would finally tip my self control to...none.  I don't want to instill fear of that sort into a child.  NOPE.

I don't want to lose my identity to being a mother.  I don't know a single mother (although I am sure they exist) who did not lose themselves utterly in being a parent.  A good friend of mine and her soon-to-be husband just gave birth to their first child days ago.  One got an associate professor position two years out of college in anthropology (rare and hard!).  She got into a PhD program fully funded!  The moment, very moment they found out there were pregnant he quit his unicorn job for one with more steady hours and higher pay (but hates it and has nothing to do with our respective educations).  She dropped out of grad school.  They both often say on their facebooks, ""We're going to be/are parents now.  All our dreams have to be put aside for our child, but regret nothing!""  I have a pit in my stomach for all that wasted potential.  Now they can't talk about anything else.  Baby, baby, baby.  Please, guys, can't we talk about...grizzly claw in context to Hopewell burials?  Please?

I know the cost of raising a child.  My mother could not support me.  The rest of my family chipped in.  I am grateful to them, but it hurt them.  Every one of them.  I like our money.  I want to know the bills are being paid and there is money left over.  I don't want this expense and I don't want to anxiety with it.

I love my hobbies.  I do not what to give them up or limit them.  

I don't want my relationship with my husband to suffer.  I know for  a fact I would be the primary care taker if we had children.  I would resent him.  I want to keep loving him and I want to continue the relationship we have built for ourselves.  A child would distance me from him greatly.

I need ""me"" time.  I need it often.  

Last but not least, I think I would honestly kill myself if I became a mother.  I cannot imagine anything that could make me so unhappy.  I am certain I would wake up one day and say, ""I don't want to do this anymore,"" and off myself.

I don't hate children but I cannot become a parent.  It would be detrimental to my health, my dreams, my identity and my life.  It's not for me.

That one quest I can't remember what it's for, but you are asked to kill a bunch of goblins attacking a farm [and once they're all dead you wake up and realize you were drugged and you actually didn't kill any goblins... You killed a bunch of innocent people](/spoiler)

The best tip I can give it to **make eye contact and SMILE**. Don't walk from the side or slightly behind and give a quiet ""hi"", it wont work most of the time. You should be in front of them for several seconds trying to make eye contact before they can pass you. When you get eye contact, acknowledge it by smiling maybe a little wave, whatever feels natural (as long as it includes a smile). Then, when they stop or hesitate (because they will if they saw your smile) hold out your hand and say ""hi, I'm nrge"".

There are people that may dismiss you regardless but that's fine, odds are they don't have time, you should expect that. But **you have to really put yourself out there** if you want people to notice you and be willing to talk to you.

Edit: formatting

Hope this helps and please don't give up, you're doing something that a large portion of the population is too afraid to even try. Which is another reason why (some) people won't talk unless you really put in the effort. Other people have these problems too."

arichi,personalfinance,1390105618.0,"&gt; Percent of income needed in retirement is 80%

It's a nice rule of thumb for people who (a) don't financially plan very much and (b) spend a high fraction of their income.

But it may or may not make sense for you.

* Do you plan to own your retirement residence(s), and if so, do you plan to have the mortgage paid off by retirement?

* If you don't plan to have the mortgage paid off by then, the expense _still_ isn't subject to inflation if you have a fixed-rate mortgage.  The nominal amount stays the same, and your house becomes _cheaper_ in real terms.  This assumes you don't do something like taking out a loan against your equity in the house.

* Do you have other debts now (e.g., student loans) that consume some of your budget but that you will have paid off by retirement?  If you can resist the urge to turn your student loan payments into spending dollars once the debt is clear, you won't need more in retirement.

* What do you plan to do with your time in retirement?  Might you work part-time (whether in your current career or in something else, such as being a golf course marshal)?

* Do you expect to get a raise in the next 40 years?  If so, why is that not calculated into your savings goals?  Or is 80% of your _right now_ salary what you expect to be enough?


That having been said, most of my suggestions are advising you that you might not need to save as much.  Don't fall into the trap of _under-saving_ for retirement.  And besides, the fact that you're thinking about this at age 25 means you're ahead of the game."

Navi1101,depression,1390105815.0,"Unattractive person here. You and I probably don't have the same problems - I'm a comically short female with itty bitty titties and a weird face - but I think we can probably do some of the same things to be ""better"" looking. That is, if you can't be attractive, at least be distinctive. Here, have some examples of what I do:

* I'm short. Like, *really* short. I could wear heels everyday, but I'd still be hilariously short even in the most stripperific of shoes, and anyway I like being able to walk normally and even run if I have to. So I own up to it and make the midget jokes before anyone else can, more frequently than anyone else dares. I have this part of my physical composure that's ridiculous and that I can't change, so I might as well live it up and make it non-awkward, right?

* My hair is gross. It's thick and wavy and frizzy, and if I let it grow out it immediately becomes an unmanageable pyramid of ick. So I chopped it all off! Rather than fighting my hair to get it into a style I want, I found one that it and I can agree on, which just so happens to also be distinctive and interesting (if a little butch (I'm straight!)). And then I dyed it a weird color. Makes me look edgy.

* My face is weird. It's round with fat cheeks and a bit of a double chin, and my eyebrows are out of control. Coincidentally, my eyesight also sucks; I have made this work for me by eschewing contacts or wire-frames in favor of thick, black, nerdy hipster glasses. These call attention to my eyes while minimizing my unattractive chin-parts, giving more of a cute, heart-shaped look to my face. And my eyebrows hide neatly behind them, so it isn't as noticeable if I go awhile without plucking (I'm a wimp and it hurts!). And then a waitress told me a few weeks ago that I had a ""sexy Velma look,"" so I got that going for me, which is nice.

* And the pimples! Ack! /r/skincareaddiction helped me figure out a routine to minimize them, and when they crop up anyway, I pretty much just make best friends with my concealer (it's okay for guys to wear concealer too!).

* My tits are small. Not much to do about that; I just wear push-up bras exclusively and go for clothes that emphasize my thinner waist and amazing butt. /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice are great resources for learning how to dress your body type, no matter what it looks like.

So, I dunno, tl;dr I guess: You don't have to be good-looking to be happy with the way you look. Find little distinctive, interesting features that you like about yourself and play these up while minimizing the things you don't like. Then at least someone will like the way you look, even if it just you; that's the most important person anyway. ;)

ETA: If you like, post some of your specific issues and I'll help you brainstorm ways to play up your good points re: them!"

mel11ism,aww,1390106106.0,"No, they werent. In fact ""pit bull"" is not even a breed. It is how people associate a few breeds that look alike together (people that don't know anything about dogs). They are naturally cuddly and mellow, hence part of the reason why they were used as ""nanny dogs"" (also for protection). 

Dont forget that these dogs are *terriers*. Whether its a yorkie or a ""pit bull"" Terrier traits are the same... bold, energetic, independent, and they have much less patience with other dogs... something that needs to be trained or controlled. Unfortunately, a 10 lb dog aggressive yorkie is funny, a 60 lb dog aggressive pit bull is not. 

The problem is that these dogs are also fiercely loyal. You tell them to do something and they are going to do it, no questions asked. That is why they work for pretty much anything, whether its a guard dog, therapy dog, or a fight dog. The people that tend to want ""mean"" dogs are also the kind of people that wont train or control them. Take one of them and train them right, and you'll have no problem.

With all that said, I wouldnt put my face near **any** strange dog, regardless of breed.

oniongasm,MensRights,1390106107.0,"A few things:

* You will often see people who identify as MRAs say that the MRM is a movement for equality, while they only focus on men's issues. Many feminists do the same thing. This is not bad. People should focus their energies most on whatever they're passionate about. They tend to get more done that way.

* Feminism is not under any obligation to directly address men's issues. The men's rights movement is not under any obligation to address women's issues. However, as long as both movements work towards the removal of gender barriers and roles, both movements will benefit each other.

* At times in this thread you've talked about feminists not ""caring"" for men. Well adjusted people care about other people. It's empathy, we all have it. Well adjusted feminists care about men. Those self-identified feminists who hate all men are about as meaningful as those MRAs who hate women. I say again: well adjusted people care about other people.

I would ask you this: what did you expect here? You hopped onto a forum dedicated to the discussion of women's issues and just plopped a vaguely titled post called ""Men's Issues"" right in the middle. You haven't been wronged, you've only received the response that *everyone expects*. It's not surprising. It's not some form of hypocrisy. It's on their sidebar for god's sake!

If you honestly want to approach people and exchange ideas, this is the wrong way to go about it. It's the equivalent of slapping your dick on the table and saying ""Eh? How do you like that?"" To participate in debate you have to address other participants' position.

In any case:

* /r/Feminism is not intended for the challenging of Feminism. It is a place to discuss feminism and feminism-related issues. Discuss. This is different than challenge.

* /r/AskFeminists is intended specifically for, well, *asking questions of Feminists*. This might be more suitable for your purposes... however --&gt; [SEE NOTE]

* /r/FeMRADebates is intended for broader discussion across the spectrum of gender rights and gender issues. You will find people who consider themselves neutral, who feel they lean towards Feminism or MRM, or who align themselves in a completely different fashion. [SEE NOTE]

**NOTE:** If you approach these subs with the mentality of ""Look at this discrepancy I found! In your face!"" you're not going to be received like a conquering hero. You will not inspire a rash of ""AHA!"" moments. You will be spat out. If you approach them with honest questions and a desire *to learn from them*, you'll have a much better time. The more you can learn about topics from multiple perspectives, the better you will understand them. If you must, think of it as opposition research (I'd argue that these are not your enemies)."

Defenestrationiste,aspergers,1390106192.0,"&gt;in a constant state of being accused of plotting.  I am never plotting.

Nailed it. That stuff sucks.  

Storytime: I was being accused of snooping and getting into things I shouldn't be getting into, legitimately wasn't doing so; simply because I know a lot about computers and both store security system vulnerabilities, camera blind spots and software vulnerabilities.  I'm literally distrusted for knowing lots of shit.  Relations improved a lot since I showed them, in a strictly white-hat fashion, where a lot of their vulnerabilities and blind spots in the security system were and told them that if I really wanted to do something criminal I'd have exploited those points by now and if I did, why the hell would I tell them about those vulnerabilities?  It was a good little mind-fuck and it made them question why they were treating me like a person of suspicion when I have an exemplary work record.  They made all sorts of sloppy errors in their security, like leaving their IP address to both the camera system and the router in plain text on paper in view of certain members of the public as well as having no antivirus on internet-connected computers as well as cash registers... all of these on a wired LAN connected via a complete fossil of a hub and router which are both sure to have serious vulnerabilities in their firmware.  Every prediction I've made about situations happening because of bad oversight or a lack of attention to certain things, has happened to boot.  I get accused because I'm able to tell people what the natural consequences of not repairing/maintaining/upgrading equipment are and when it eventually breaks down, I am accused of having something to do with it because I predicted the inevitable.  * *facepalm* *  If I weren't paid fairly well for retail work, I'd have left this job a while ago.  Regardless, they ARE treating me better now and I'm satisfied with it for the time being.

Confessiontime: There are a few vulnerabilities which I've not told them about and kept to myself in case I need to use them to make someone look stupid if I start getting the finger pointed at me again.  *""Always keep an ace up your sleeve,""* so to speak."

I warned you in no uncertain terms to cut the shit or we were done. Then you decided to harass me further with a second account and I quote without altering a god damn thing:

&gt;I know I have been arrogant and pretentious, but there is a key difference between you and me.
The difference is that I was only ignorant and pretentious toward you, one single person, whom I've judge on the words they said. You are an arrogant and pretentious asshole when it comes to any person who has genitalia they did not chose nor had control over.
You have prejudice, I just have judgment. I wait until some one proves that they are bigot/asshole/rude before I judge them in a negative manner. You on the other hand preemptively hate.
I'm also not afraid to stand up to it and call a spade a spade. You claim you do the same, but when the mirror is in your face you run away.
I hope you can see why these are wildly different things.

Being willfully ignorant and pretentious are not virtues. It actually means you agree you were arguing from an unjust standpoint. Not only did you lose the debate, you admit it unknowingly. Good job, retard.

The real difference between you and I is that I practice discernment, whereas you are merely judgmental.

I'm not sure how you think the existence of intersexed folks disproves the existence of men and women; I'd love to hear your reasoning.  Regardless, you are not intersexed.  You were born with a penis and XY chromosomes, so you're male."
another30yovirgin,AskMen,1390106666.0,"I think a lot of the advice on AskMen is generally pretty bad. Part of that is because of the questions asked, part is because of the way posters imagine the scenario. For example:

**Scenario 1:** Do you think I should ask this guy out? 

AskMen will always respond to questions like this with ""nobody ever asks us out. We always love it when women ask us out."" While it's true that men don't get asked out a lot, they often are caught off guard, aren't interested in the girl, and don't know how to handle it. Now that isn't to discourage women from asking men out--women definitely should ask men out. The issue is that men will see this question and imagine their dream girl asking them out. That's probably not what's going on. It may be that she's a great girl who means a lot to him as a friend, but for whom he has no feelings; it may be that she's a girl he barely remembers meeting; it could be the girl he's not interested in at all, but who keeps bugging him. We don't know, so we assume it's our dream girl.

On a related note: most men are not attracted to all of their female friends, yet when asked this question, they will say yes, because they're attracted to *some* of their female friends and the others don't come to mind when they're thinking of their friends. It's like saying ELEPHANT think of a grey land mammal.

**Scenario 2:** Do you think this guy likes me? 

Similar problem--when women write to the men of AskMen, we assume they're exactly the type we'd want to date. We also *love* a good happy ending, especially when it concerns our dream girls. So yeah, *of course he likes you. You're going to be so happy together!*

We don't recognize that you are not attractive to him.

**Scenario 3:** What does he think about when... ? 

We men have been told all of our lives that we're depraved and disgusting. We are awful perverts. We've also been told for most of our lives that women are pure and don't have the nasty dirty thoughts that men have, and they'd probably be shocked if they had any idea of the awful things going on in our minds. And this is the Internet, and on reddit there is at least *some* anonymity. And you've just given us an excuse to say the most disgusting thing that we can think of, that we really never have thought, but we kind of wish we could have thought, because it would be awesome to be that disturbed.

**Scenario 4:** My ex is a total asshole. Reddit, tell me I'm right

This post seems increasingly to be clogging up reddit. It basically starts with a poster excluding all of the details that would make him/her look bad from a story of some sort. We don't know the details, but the way you've told the story, obviously we think your ex should be burned at the stake. Granted, you haven't told the exonerating details, but that's really a small part of it.

**Scenario 5:** My boyfriend/girlfriend and I are having trouble with one aspect of our relationship. What do?

In this case, AskMen will usually say ""break up"". This is especially true if the poster is a woman. Because she can do better, obviously. In our collective minds, the woman posting is extremely desirable and attractive and could have any guy she wants, yet she is sticking with this douchebag who insists on taking up 2/3 of the bed. And then we think: this obviously attractive Internet stranger is putting up with this shit, yet I would never do anything like that. Obviously attractive Internet strangers should all want to be with a great guy like me."

Cigarettes on the other hand are simply a tool for getting a fix. 

According to the studies I have read, you would have to smoke about 3-5 cigars a day for a very substantial amount of time (i.e. years) before being close to the cancer risks of a cigarette smoker. So someone who enjoys a cigar or pipe even once a week is basically still at the same risk as a nonsmoker for getting cancer.

w00ten,hardware,1390106885.0,"What I was getting at is that if Intel sits at that barrier long enough, eventually AMD's consumer offering will catch up in terms of fabrication process. Intel will definitely hit the solution first, but AMD may have a few months or maybe even a year where their fabrication will match Intel for transistor size and we will be right back to where we were with the Athlon 64. The real determining factor is how quickly Intel can develop new kinds of transistors using materials like Graphene. Some of the clock speeds being reached using Graphene transistors are nothing short of ""fucking incredible"". Some researchers are saying that speeds of up to 400Ghz may be possible with Graphene transistors because it effectively has 0 or negative resistance when used properly. I'm going to cut off there as we are now pushing into the realm of physics and this isn't the place for that. Anyone here who works as a sys admin should be reading up on this stuff as it is the future of our industry and our lives as IT professionals."

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390106907.0,"The main reason BC causes weight gain is because of appetite changes, You're clearly compensating for that by setting yourself a calorie goal and sticking to it, so you need to talk to your doctor about how the pill is effecting your Metabolic rate. This could involve blood tests to check your thyriod.

In the meantime, use some online calculators to check your BMR at rest, While there is a compulsion to just eat as few calories as possible to lose weight, you don't really want to go below your BMR because that can effect more issues with thyroid secretions and made hormonal-weight issues even worse.

If you're not sure about taking your calories back up based on your BMR, perhaps consider a specific deit style, like paleo, keto or 5:2. Keto is especially good for hormonal weight gain.

Above all else, talk to your doctor. Actual weight gain separate from appetite is incredibly rare."

Rin is polarizing... you either get caught up in her, or you really, *really* don't. That's even made evident within her route itself; if you don't ""get"" Rin, people don't want to put up with her weirdness. And that same thing goes for her entire route.

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1390107291.0,"&gt;These edits are getting confusing fast but I like your style. I feel like ""Dark Americana"" is just a glorified offshoot of Americana itself, which is somewhat broad--broad enough to be inclusive like that. I guess black can be used in such situations, but only if the whole outfit is somewhat dark like yours is.

I don't consider my outfit ""Dark Americana"" or even ""Americana""

&gt;For context: there are many things I'd never buy in black (maybe because they don't fit my style, but definitely because one of the other colors I enjoy listing repeatedly would look better with it), such as dress shirts, OCBD's, jackets and casual chinos.

If you don't like black or want to wear it that's fine, but justacknowledge that objectively the colour goes well with many other colours. It is honestly just basic colour theory, and the idea that it isn't versatile is a little silly."

Most hospitals utilize electronic medical record, which in many cases not only list medication allergies, but the exact reaction as stated by the patient. So obviously, the ER doc thought you had a bacterial infection of some sort and that you needed antibiotics (btw different antibiotics are better in certain situations because different types of infections (i.e. skin, vs community acquired pneumonia vs community acquired pneumonia vs UTI etc ) each have there most common organism list, which can be treated by specific antibiotics. So weighing this and her choices of antibiotics vs what you were allergic too was probably part of her decision making, which came to a solution, that in your eyes, which is understandably, unacceptable.   

And yes, it does kinda annoy doctors when you primarily get your care at another facility but then decide to show up, especially if they are part of two separate medical establishments with two different EMR systems.

""I didn't do that but ok... do you want it over there?""

""No, it's been kind've annoying.""

tPRoC,malefashionadvice,1390107449.0,"&gt;EDIT: Sheltered? Perhaps. Traditionalist? Sure. Isolated or delusional? I don't think so. It's more of an internet fashion forum thing than a real life thing to obsess over how great the color black is. Black has formal connotations to this day for various reasons. That won't just disappear.

They disappeared a long time ago. Obsessing over how black *isn't* a versatile colour is an incredibly internet thing to do. I regularly see many people wearing mostly black outfits (or at least outfits that incorporate black) day-to-day- including fashionable people, streetwear-wearing kids, the elderly, and middle-aged moms. It doesn't have nearly as many real life connotations as you think it does, hence the fact that ""Black goes with everything"" is common advice outside of MFA.

&gt;You're right, but business casual is almost always done with a brown/earth tone palette and dark colors come about incidentally. They are usually navy blue or dark greys, like charcoal gray. Black put in place of those colors doesn't necessarily make it ""better"" or worse, but you could find nicer combinations.

I addressed this in another comment. It's not about ""nicer"" combinations, if you changed the colours in his fits then the fits would no longer evoke the same mood that they do. If you gave his outfits a generic earth tone palette, he would *literally* be dressed by the internet instead of wearing colours and styles that suit him. 

&gt;My real beef with black is that it's so harsh, so harsh. Using it drowns out other colors or emphasizes them too much. 

It is not actually that harsh, and as long as you know what you're doing it is easy to use it without drowning out or emphasizing other colors too much. Take this [derk fit](http://i.imgur.com/LMrFFX5.jpg) for example. In this outfit, black and tan are the strongest colours and they work very well together. 

&gt;It also isn't practical in warm places (though neither are the other dark colors).

[That is actually a myth.](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1886/does-black-clothing-keep-you-cooler) Black does absorb more heat but there are a bunch of other factors involved, with the end result being that what colour you wear during the summer is mostly negligible- there is even some evidence to suggest that wearing white might actually be hotter."

cincodenada,dataisbeautiful,1390107509.0,"So, a disclaimer: I know next to nothing about football, and don't really carrrrrrrrrrrrre much either way.  But being in Seahawks territory, I had to make a companion chart to the [offenses](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1vgcjj/nfl_offenses_this_season_including_playoffs/) chart.  The Seahawks aren't *quite* as much of a standout in defense as the Broncos are in offense, but they're certainly on their own in that lower-left corner.

I just took the data from the [NFL's site](http://www.nfl.com/stats/categorystats?archive=false&amp;conference=null&amp;role=OPP&amp;offensiveStatisticCategory=null&amp;defensiveStatisticCategory=GAME_STATS&amp;season=2013&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;tabSeq=2&amp;qualified=false&amp;Submit=Go) - it's just the regular season, because I didn't want to have to figure out how to add and weight things for the postseason.

Any feedback is welcome, as I may well have made errors given my lack of knowledge.  I assumed the yards/points in the defense tables were points *allowed*, so let me know if that was erroneous.

I put the code I made the chart with up [over on GitHub](https://github.com/cincodenada/NFL-Stats) - it's mainly R, with some other stuff to grab/format the data.

dakru,AskMen,1390107515.0,"Any time where the poster has their mind made up already and responds with hostility to people who disagree because they posted their question not to get people's opinions but to validate their own opinion.

The worst examples of this come in the forever-alone posts that talk about whether they should give up on dating. They start off expressing their frustration with rejection, which is fine because we've all been there. But they respond to any attempt to help them improve with complete insistence that it's impossible for them to succeed with women, no matter how tried-and-true the advice is. Either they don't want to put in the effort at all or they're convinced that they've already put in enough effort (like the guy who once was convinced that asking women out didn't work because he'd been rejected three times).

I think what happens in many cases is that they've made their decision to not bother trying to succeed with women but they don't want to feel responsible for the consequences of actually making the decision (the consequences being not having a girlfriend), so they come on here to try to convince us to tell them it's ok.

So there are guys out there who do get off this often, but that doesn't mean that as one of their wives you have to have sex with them that often or even just perform.

askgeeves,Colorization,1390107793.0,"Hi, you definitely made a decent first effort but heres a couple of tips from me:

- Colourisations rarely look realistic with low quality photos. I'm not sure if there is a specific sentimental reason you chose this photo but generally I find it needs to be quite sharp and details need to be crisp for a realistic result. On this note the original photo would need to be restored and significantly cleaned up (mostly on the skin areas) for a polished end look, but even then the lack of detail would make it difficult to create a realistic end product.

- Not sure if you did this already but I find it easier to desaturate sepia photos before applying colour. It's much easier to match skin tones which are a little bit off here (too pink maybe?).

- It's really quite common on this subreddit for first timers to oversaturate the colours to an unrealistic extent but I feel that this photo might be a little undersaturated for a realistic look, unless the look of a very aged colour photo is a stylistic choice you are making in which case go for it!

- I find it tends to look better with a slightly contrasting background. Studios tend to have blue or green backgrounds which I find a safe bet. If you want pinkish maybe desaturate a lot so it's not so similar to the skin colour. I also like to do each person's skin tones separately as people rarely have exactly the same skin tone and lighting makes a big difference in how it will appear.

I hope you don't mind but I've done a quick (less than 3 min) [edit of your final colour photo](http://imgur.com/xFUn5tL) (increased contrast, desaturated background and made a different colour, adjusted colour balance *very* slightly) implementing some of the things I've mentioned which I think brings out all the detail that you put into the woman's face. But yeah with a low quality photo there's only so far you can take it!

Ah, I've written a lot but that's just because I'm not a very concise writer, not a reflection on your work! Just practice, the quality increases really rapidly in the first few colourisations, you'll be shocked!"

Inching along the map is hella boring though, and I end up using Octocamo the same way as I used camo in MGS3.  Instead of switching camo every five seconds, I manually set a camoflage that is appropriate for the general area.  In the Middle East I'd pick a roughly sand coloured one, in South America I'd use a green or foliage based one (the one of the prestocked DPM patterns).

That also makes for a fun little meta-game in multiple playthroughs of MGS4, where you are trying to get the best possible collection of camos in your limited number of slots."

Not only that but there is still no open world yet. Will there never be? Am I doomed to save points for the whole game?

The other thing, the game is a pain in the butt, always fighting the player with unannounced party rearrangements (Bahamut fight, death to ye!) and only through massive tedium can you go beyond the preset character archetypes.

Then there is the story. It's so lame. It's maybe 30-40 minutes of story to tell and they just keep reaffirming the same status repeatedly, for hours of gameplay, in multitudes of cutscenes. The writing is horrible. They obviously felt the need to extend this game way beyond its natural story tempo. It's just sad.

Areat,Politique,1390107908.0,"A noter que la précédente constitution proposée par les frères musulmans avait en 2012 recueilli 63,8 % de oui, pour une participation de 32,9 %, ce qui permet paradoxalement aux militaires de clamer aujourd'hui que ce résultat est une victoire.               

Le général Al Sissi ne cesse depuis des mois de se poser en homme providentiel, prêt à se porter au secours de l'Égypte si le peuple le réclame, etc, et il est clair qu'il espère faire passer ce vote pour un tremplin vers la présidentielle.                     
Présidentielle à laquelle ne pourra se porter candidat un membre d'un parti religieux, encore moins un Frère musulman au parti dissous et proclamé comme terroriste. Clairement, les généraux font tout pour que tout revienne comme avant la révolution, alors même que bien peu de choses dans le fond n'ont changées.                          

Ceci dit, à la présidentielle, Morsi, avec moins de 25 % des voix au premier tour, n'avait finalement gagné que parce que les votes en faveurs de modernistes s'étaient éparpillées sur plusieurs candidats, favorisant  un second tour entre un Frère musulman et un candidat clairement héritier de Moubarak. La peste par défaut plutôt que le choléra, façon 2002 chez nous.

WeaponsGradeHumanity,swtor,1390108000.0,"This looks useful as *fuck*.  

I especially like the little things that tell you when a datacron has extra requirements.  I notice how you have the costs for certain items as hypertext next to the items but then other datacrons are listed as having a cost in straight text.  I think this is too subtle to be useful and that it omits some items which should be mentioned.  It would be better if you did something like "" [spanner] MGGS ([credits] 10 000)"" and "" [icon] thingy_for_opening_space_chest ([credits] 5 000)"" instead.  I also can't tell what the supertext next to minute values is supposed to be.  
There are a few other adjustments I'd suggest.  You have room to move the Galactic History numbers further to the right of the datacron values (and you should probably label or legend the column).  You've listed all the flashpoints as having a single level when it is probably more useful to list the level range at which you can queue for them using Group Finder.  I have the feeling there are some bonus series missing too.  So far as I'm aware, the level limit on the Fleet datacron is 45.  I think it'd be a good idea to include a [jump] icon to indicate datacrons which involve jumping puzzles.  
Do Smugglers really not have a level 15 Matrix Cube option?

The rampant bitching about Rising probably isn't encouraging though.

Additionally, but less importantly, certain types of muscle fibers (myofibrals) are better for lifting things, while sarcoplasm, the watery type of fiber that makes up most muscle growth, contributes much less.

*This turned into a rant. Mostly for my own benefit as I wanted to get these thoughts down. Sorry. But I'll leave it here anyway in case you find it hepful in some way.*

It also means that you neglect the things you did well. If you only focus on the negative you may miss something that you did really well. In fact focussing on the negative makes you almost stop learning altogether. Let me explain:

Say you're playing golf (I've only played golf once so bear with me) and you're fine with power but DAMNIT the ball just keeps going a mile to the right. So you focus on hitting straight. But then you notice the ball isn't going as far so you stop trying to aim and start working on power again. But it starts going to the right again... see the pattern?

By focussing only on the negative without noticing what you did well you'll never (or only very slowly) improve. Because you neglect to keep up the good habits you have as well as trying to improve the bad ones you end up improving almost nothing."

prairie_girls,Calgary,1390109066.0,"Swizzlesticks is really dated and it's a terrible layout.  You could be having a ""relaxation"" massage ten feet away from the waiting room where people are chatting.  I had an appointment towards the end of the day there once and they kept vacuuming right outside the door of my room.  They also offer some services on a different level that you have to access down a steep, narrow staircase (my memory tells me that it's spiral?) which I always thought was a safety hazard in those spa flip-flops.

I've consistently had really good treatments at Riverside Spa.  However, of all the spas I've been to in Calgary the change room there is the most cramped.  As well, the building really gives off a bad 80s vibe.  It's not exactly classy.  On the plus side, the lounge area has lots of different herbal teas and three kinds of cookies!

I think the best balance of nice facilities and decent treatments would be the Spa Ritual at Crowfoot.  They are a sister salon to Sante Spa downtown (which also has a location at Hotel Le Germain, I think) but I highly prefer the facilities at Spa Ritual.  Tons of free parking, a larger space, better snacks in the waiting room (which I'm kind of obsessed with) and nicer lounge facilities while you wait.    

The Stillwater at the Hyatt is another option.  They validate parking.  It's been a long time since I've been there but I think the change rooms were decent (spacious, with steam room I think, and definitely a bizarre little hot tub), the lounge area was nice and my treatments were fine."

spoonfedsam,SuicideWatch,1390109168.0,"I've been suffering from suicidal ideation and depression since last March. I started getting help this past October and am seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. I am on two antidepressants.

The suicidal ideation is pretty much as good as gone now. I don't think about it like I used to.

One of my best friends, who I almost dated, had been a big part of my happiness this past year. She was a big key to my happiness. She was a big source of support. However, it started getting too much for her. She had lost a close family friend to suicide and couldn't stand to see me go down like this, and lost sleep and was worrying about me, not wanting one of her close friends to take his life also. ""It hurts me seeing you like this,"" she once said. She was considering not talking to me anymore, but she didn't want to have to do that. So she came up with a little ""experiment,"" in which we don't talk for about 3 weeks (which started last Monday), and she blocks/deletes me from Facebook, so as to experience a fake loss...to see what her life would be like if I committed suicide. It was also a way to determine if she could still talk to me. If I could come out of it seeing how suicide is a horrible thing and have the will to live and fight, then she said would still talk to me.  She hoped that I would learn something from it and gain some insight. Well, it's working so far. I miss her like crazy. And this is pretty much the reason why my suicidal thinking has gone away. I wouldn't want to put my friends and family through what I'm going through, no matter how unhappy I may be.

And I can't pinpoint the exact reason why I'm unhappy.  I don't know if it's because I'm intimidated by going back to school and having to deal with the college grind again, the fact that I've never had a girlfriend... There seems to be a lot of different reasons for why I'm unhappy. 

I don't know why I feel so alone, despite having many friends. I wish I knew..."

Only nostalgia makes people like these games. They are historically relevant, but, game design has come a long long way and shows us that SquareSoft was lucky we even bothered to play their tedious games. Though these days it seems like they're going to the opposite extremes with ""Run down one extremely long tedious hall"" FFXIII...

FFV might give a little trouble, but, it is just because it expects you to grind. Use a spoilerfree walkthrough if you can find one. However, IV I had no trouble just burning straight through and the story was decent enough. VI is pretty good in this way too.

In every FF game and other similar games there will be things you might miss, but, that's okay. I think it only makes these games feel terrible if you feel obligated to visit every corner. Do what interests you and enjoy the main story arcs.

If I was itching to experience the story (but not the grind so much) I would just play all these older games on an emulator on the computer and use game genie codes for infinite life/spells/etc. and burn through with a guide to look up where to go next as necessary.

We've got brown eggs, but they're in the minority; we watch the same media, of course, and more of it, and so quite a lot of people consider non-white eggs (not just brown, but speckled and such) to be abnormal or unhealthy; the visual-merchandising aspects of the grocery business reinforce this sort of thing.  But for most people, it's just the sort of food they grew up with and don't want to work to expand that boundary.  I do it myself- white eggs and brown eggs cost the same, and I get white; brown eggs just seem not-right on some instinctive level.  It's hard to overcome a gut feeling like that.

There are similar areas in London, Paris, New York and pretty much any other metropolitan city. But if, for example in London, there were Wetherspoons bars who would start putting up signs that said ""No foreigners allowed, whites only"" there's be an international outcry and rightfully so. But apparently racial segregation is ok as long is it's not white people doing it. 

&gt;they don’t even have to let you come into their country, but they do. you’re lucky the larger cities there even have places for you to congregate and you’re lucky natives even allow you into their country. if you don’t like it, leave.

mundabit,ChronicPain,1390109824.0,"I had a functional MRI done last week after seeing a doctor who took me seriously. It turns out my uterus is fused to my bowel, and weirdly, I could no be happier because it means there is a real physical reason for all my abdominal/pelvic pain, and maybe now doctors will stop telling me its because i'm fat and depressed.

On an unrelated note, last night one of my breasts started lactating, and now I'm more concerned about how swollen the lymphnode on that side has been. I had it checked by my GP months ago, he said it was just normal inflammation, probably because I ""had a flu"" (I didn't have a flu, I had a flare) So I'll be bringing that up on Monday with the GYN managing my sticky uterus. 

I'm not too fussed about the pain in my breast, its my normal type of pain, its just causing a bit of anxiety because of the new symptom. I'm keeping that anxiety under control because I don't want any stress to cause a flare, I've been doing pretty well this week."

1. It's possible to justify US prices for some (not all) Apple hardware. But if we start talking Europe, Apple product price tags are crazy compared to the competition. The lowest specced Mac Mini is 655 eur ~= $890. 

2. The barrier of entry is just too high. In my country, I can slap together a basic PC for ~$250, throw in a windows license for ~$100 and I'm golden. A Mac - any Mac - is $890+. And for general web surfing/office tasks, the $250 PC (with its $50 Celeron CPU) would run *faster* because it would have a desktop HDD.

3. If we forget about the sexy design, even US prices for most Apple products are outrageous. $600+tax for a dual core mac mini with 4gb and slow-as-molasses laptop HDD? $1300 for an iMac? How does one justify that?"

My advice:

When you see her, give her a big hug. Tell her she looks great. I suggest paying for her, but actually the last two dates I've been on I had all expenses covered surprisingly (movies and a concert).

When conversing with her, look her in the eyes. Try not to break that eye contact, and if you do, look up or to the upper sides. *Never* lower. Smile. Crack jokes, make observations. **Don't seek her validation or approval with what you say.** When you're with her, remember that you're the man. Be confident because she's spending her precious, irreplaceable time with **you**. When talking, don't interview her. If you're asking too many questions, start making statements of assumption. Example: instead of asking someone ""where are you from?"" say ""You must be from ____."" Obviously you're not going to ask her where she's from unless she's foreign, which would be pretty cool.

MrTinkels,AskMen,1390109932.0,"I'm in a LDR with my SO who I'm fucking crazy about, and have been since I was 20. The distance sucks but we decided that we were both too good of a catch to let go so easily so we're sticking it out. I get to see her about once ever 3 or so months and despite the distance it's the best relationship I've ever had. School sucks, work sucks, but at the end of the day I know that she'll be there to decompress to. We talk most nights and just tell each other about our days and it helps. Skype and shit helps too. We also write letters like we're old timey folk and it at least leaves something tangible to hold unlike a text message. 

I've coped by just doing other shit. Keeping busy with grad school, my job, and working out has left very little time in the day. I try to fill the gaps with shit that keeps my mind occupied, like cooking or video games but sometimes it seeps in and you realize that she's hundreds of miles away and there are plenty of guys that are right next to her that could give her what she wants every day. After a moment though, I realize she picked me for a reason and that my insecurities aren't going to do anything but sabatoge the relationship. 

In closing, I'd say gopher it dude. Distance is only going to crumple a weak relationship. If you think this chick is worth it do it. There will always be some strange to tackle later. If this shit is legit you owe it yourself to give it a try.

ztj,FinalFantasy,1390110227.0,"For me:
1) It takes place in Ivalice, my all time favorite fantasy world. Other games in this universe include: Final Fantasy Tactics Series and Vagrant Story.

2) I believe it has, by a large margin, the best written story of all Final Fantasy games. Don't misunderstand, there are many things to latch on to and really love in the other games, but, this is the only game with writing that would have even a small chance of standing up in the face of an indifferent public audience. It's mature in the best way and unfolds elegantly.

3) The gambit system is the greatest RPG streamlining mechanism ever invented which is why I can not fathom why Square went with the wretched battle system in FFXIII. What a huge downgrade.

As for the character role customization: Square hasn't made a legitimate role playing game in 20 years. It's not what these games are about. If you're looking for a more genuine role playing experience, you're best served elsewhere. The design intentionally blurs roles to avoid making a player fight the story when progressing their party.

darthbarracuda,Warthunder,1390110310.0,"Definitely use the test flight option for a while. Get used to the planes, the maneuvers, taking off/landing, different functions, etc. Being a little educated about the planes makes them much easier to fly and fight with.

Use the ""C"" button if you are on PC to look around yourself before going in for a fight. Make sure nobody's going to dive or ram you.

Don't go for someone if there's a group of enemies in the area. If you can manage, try to have a buddy with you, so if someone else comes along to kill you, your buddy can get him off your tail.

Try using combat flaps. It makes your turns a little quicker.

Don't wait for the last second to turn. If you know they are turning or you're going to pass them up, turn in advance. That way you won't lose him for as long.

Stay away from AAAs, Tanks, Howitzers, Armored Cars, and Ships, unless you plan on taking them out. They are deadly at close range.

Since you seem to be fairly new player, I would say try sticking with the group. Don't go solo. Attack a plane that someone or a group is already attacking. Just don't get friendly fire.

Another idea is to stick behind where your bases and airfield is. Less enemies go there, there's ground units, and usually one or two other friendlies in the area. That way you'll only get one or two fighters in the area and it'll be easier to take them out.

Don't fret it. I sucked at this game for the longest time, and then everything started to click. It takes practice and a little bit of strategy and knowing the limits of your planes."

pretzelzetzel,WritingPrompts,1390110345.0,"I awoke in darkness. I knew I'd been drugged. I blinked my eyes but they wouldn't adjust to the blackness. I tried to move but my limbs were immobile. Was I sitting? I was sitting on a chair. My hands and feet were tied. As my senses and wits trickled back to me, I became aware of muffled voices surrounding me. Some spoke a language I understood; some didn't. I still couldn't make sense of the darkness. 

A cowl! 

My head was covered with a heavy, dark cloth of some kind. The darkness, the muffled sounds; my head was covered. I tried to call out but discovered I'd been gagged as well. 

Just as I had solved this final piece of the puzzle, the cowl, it was ripped violently from my head to expose my weakened eyes to a harshly bright bulb mere inches away from my face. I shut my eyes against the pain. As I opened them further and further, I discerned that the bulb was hanging by its cord from an unseen ceiling, and that the ceiling covered a bare warehouse, empty but for some ropes, towels, a bucket of water and a car battery, the significance of all of which I was soon to learn. 

I opened my mouth to ask for water, and suddenly was on my back choking on my own tooth. Someone had struck me. 

""Wh... why..."" I coughed as the blood flowed. 

""You'd better make your next sentence a list of names, Aziz. Or should I say 'Nafir al-Nizar'? Yeah, I know you, see. I know your name, address, number.. I know your mama's fucking bra size, you shitstain. If you lie, I know. If I know you've lied, I hurt you."" 

The dark shape moved closer and the face solidified into a young but careworn one, a blonde-haired American of about 30 years. 

""I'm going to ask you one time: who holds the Cayman account under the name 'Ali Baba Construction and Engineering'?"" 

Ali Baba? I had been dancing in a nightclub in Beirut when an affable American fellow had offered me a drink. Next thing I knew I was bound and gagged in this warehouse. Ali Baba? I'm a student, I thought. 

""I swear I don't know --"" 

""Wrong answer,"" the man cut me off. He barked a command to his cronies who lifted me bodily off the floor, cut me loose from the chair, and began to drag me toward a tiny box in the corner of the room. 

""John!"" my mom called. ""Time for school!""

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390110387.0,"Wow, what the fuck is this feel good bullshit I'm reading in the comments? This is /r/theredpill not /r/tellmewhatiwanttohear. OP needs real honesty if he is going to see any improvement, not hamstering. I swear to God if this place turns into some /r/seduction type place filled with, ""Just be super possitive with a good attitude"" type fuckery, I'm burning the whole place down to the ground. 

So anyways, to answer OP: Yes, it does mean you are giving off a low SMV. It could either be from a weak frame, low percieved social value, or low positive physical characteristics. It's probably a mix of all three. 

I'm more concerned with the lack of IOIs to be honest. For the most part, even the highest SMV guys are going to constantly have ugly chicks flirt with them. However, IOIs are very basic level things where many guys will get them from 9s but just fail at following through. If you aren't able to get any sort of IOI from an 8, then yes, there is a problem. 

When I was a good 20 pounds overweight, I can tell you right now, I wasn't getting many 8s giving me passive IOIs before meeting them. The only time they were, was when I was clearly the center of attention with the group -- essentially being alpha with full frame control. However, when I lost the 20 pounds and threw on 10 pounds of muscle, it was like day and night with the type of women approaching me. It went from getting 6s routinely give me IOIs to straight up 8s secretly grabbing my ass at the bar. It went from trying hard to get her to open up by throwing tons of game and dealing with constant shit tests, to her throwing really light tests and really wanting to submit to my frame. 

The truth is, you need to do more work, it's as simple as that. I recommend getting into good physical shape, because usually that helps you work on your confidence and frame ontop of the benefits of just being in shape. You'll find girls are easier to talk to, you'll have more success, you'll be more comfortable talking to these women, and eventually it'll become much easier. 

The reality is it's 99% social ability, but you have to be a pro to do it entirely on social skills alone. It's much easier to work on the fitness side as well as the social side, then work on the harder advanced levels. The advanced levels of the social side are also a ton easier to learn when in shape. It's definitely doable, but it's still unnecessarily hard to just go for only the social aspect. If you're already in shape, how do you dress? How do you hold yourself? What's your grooming like and odor? These all play into it. Just throwing on that unfitted button up and a fedora isn't cutting it. Check out /r/malefashionadvice if needed. "

ThoughtRiot1776,CampingandHiking,1390110391.0,"I would definitely hike to Guitar Lake from Kearsarge or Cottonwood Pass.  The dayhike would be far too difficult for an 8 year old IMO.  The elevation change alone is pretty killer.  Guitar Lake is 11.5K (tad less) so you only have to gain another 3K on summit day while cutting back on the mileage.  

Unless you typo'd and you're talking about an 18 year old.

Still, the multi-day option doesn't require the special (and pretty limited) Whitney Zone permits, which is nice.  Plus, you get better acclimated.  And if you get up early, you can catch the sun rise. 

I'd stick with the standard mid/late June-August time frame if possible. 

If you go over Kearsarge Pass, you can hit Mt. Gould too, which is really easy.  You can see a slight use trail from the pass itself, but it's pretty easy.  The summit block is a little tricky though, probably class 3 and the move might be too much for an 8 year old (not strength or conditioning, just might not be tall enough). "

JohnStamosAsABear,exchristian,1390110476.0,"Sorry about the long story, I tried making it as short as possible, but this is what I learned from my experiences in sexual awkwardness.

I used to be pretty cautious about even getting myself into a situation where I could be tempted, because I was afraid that I wouldn't have the self control to stop myself. My ""first time"" was when I had barely turned 20 and happened during a night of drinking. I put that in quotes because I stopped after like 2 minutes because I felt too guilty. The same situation happened again a year later and again I had to stop because of the guilt. By my ""third time"" I wasn't really active in the church and was hooking up with a girl who had no idea I was so awkward about sex. I stopped her the first time she tried to initiate sex, mainly b/c of the guilt and also b/c I was embarrassed that I practically had no experience, so I lied and said it was because we didn't have protection. We kinda faded apart after that, largely because I was so awkward about it and didn't want to have to explain why. I couldn't even explain it to myself. My doubts about Christianity had been growing stronger and I wrestled with why God even bothered making me with these urges if I was a dirty sinner just by thinking about it. I was sick of these awkward conflicting feelings, so at one point I had decided that next time if the situation was right, I would just go for it. This ended up being with a girl I dated for almost 2 years and what made it the ""right time"" was because I really liked her and felt comfortable around her. 

So the main point of that story is that you're just going to have to go for it one day. Its an unknown for you and it's only natural for someone to be scared and nervous about something they haven't done before, especially with all the cultural taboos placed on it. 

Don't let your awkwardness about sex stop you from having a relationship. You can have a great relationship without having sex. Just be honest with any girl you end up getting involved with and if you're not ready or comfortable enough to do it, don't. If you are with a girl who can't accept or be supportive about that then she's not the type of girl who's worth it in the first place. In my opinion, the whole idea behind waiting until marriage is so that sex will be something special between you and your wife. You can still have that special intimacy without having to wait until you are married. Don't go out looking just to put some notches in your belt because that will not help. If you act like a man-whore you're not going to attract any good self-respecting girls. Despite what what our hyper-sexual society tells you, you don't have to be that guy and any girl who's worth your time will admire and respect your decision. 

It's cliche advice but there isn't really any other way to describe it, you'll just know when you're ready. Dating does not mean you have to have sex and you may not end up sleeping with the first girl you end up dating. Just getting experience with dating will help you slowly learn what sort of qualities you want in a girl and that alone may help you find someone you care enough about and feel comfortable enough around to finally take that step. And the girl you first sleep with may not be the girl that you end up marrying. 

So if there's a girl out there you like, go for it. You don't have to have sex with her. Just have a shit ton of fun while you get to know her better and be honest about it when the time comes. When that time does come, you'll know and be safe about it. "

That being said, Lebron is only averaging 1.6 more assists per game, so it's not like he's blowing KD out of the water in that category. "

WeaponsGradeHumanity,WorldofTanks,1390110674.0,"You can't skip crew levels...  

When you play WoT you gain exp.  You gain it on tanks and you gain it on crews.  The exp you gain on tanks is spent on upgrades for that tank and on unlocking the next tank.  The exp you gain on crews automatically improves that crew's qualifications.  Each crew member has a primary qualification that determines how good he is at his job; driving, gunning, loading, etc.  When you buy a crew for a tank you decide what level you want their primary qualification to be at.  You can get 50% for free, 75% for about 20k credits per crewman or 100% for 100 gold.  As you play, experience gained on a crew will improve this percentage until it hits 100% and at that point you get to select additional qualifications for each crew member.  These are called skills or perks and they start at 0%.  Skills will function even at low percentages while perks do not function until they hit 100%.  

When you move up from one tank to the next, you can keep the crew and pay a fee to retrain them.  How much of their skill percentage is preserved depends on the school you send them to, just like buying a new crew.  For 10k credits each, they retain 90% of the previous value they had, for gold they retain 100% of the value, for free they retain 75% of the value.  

If you start a crew at 50% it's not that you're avoiding skipping levels, it's that you're deliberately hamstringing your ability to do anything and everything.  You'll fire half as fast as you should, drive half as fast as you should, see half as far as you should.  If you start at 75% then your crew will be able to function well enough that you won't be shooting yourself in the foot.  At low tiers, you will unlock the next tank well before you can get a 75% crew anywhere near 100% (let alone get a 50% crew anywhere near 75%).  The grind for tank exp doesn't match the grind for crew exp until about tier five.  This means that below tier five you might as well buy a new 75% crew for every new vehicle because carrying crews over will cost you the same price and not really gain you anything.  It also means that after tier five you'll want to start preserving crews as you go up lines because you'll spend long enough on each machine to advance the crew enough to make them worth keeping.  

Be sure to read the crew page on the wiki (and the battle mechanics page too).  "

dnw5032,OpiatesRecovery,1390110676.0,"I am a recovering heroin addict with 14 months clean. I am currently the president of my oxford (halfway) house. I'm on my sixth step(na).  I have a sponsor and one sponsee. You come off as a relatively successful person. Firstly I would start off with something you might not want to hear, if you really care about your son getting his shit together you need to begin by setting an example and quit smoking pot. Second, you yourself should seriously look into alanon although I'm sure you already know all about it.  I went to treatment twice, so relapse is apart of my story.  The second time I had a geographical change. I changed my phone number my email my city and state my facebook and everything.  My parents were done with me and if you love him you will have to abandon him before he will find his own footing in life.  Have I found a passion yet? No.  Am I using? No.  Am I keep my head afloat and paying my own bills? Yes.  NA where I relocated to is a very strong inspiring community.  I should also mention that I am only 24. Like many others have said, your son has to make this decision himself. My advice is to not give up on 12 step programs.  Treatment opened my eyes and meetings keep me right.  My oxford house was crucial to my recovery in the beginning but that's me.  A lot of people move in relapse and get evicted. But when I moved in there were people there who had been doing this staying clean thing for awhile and they guided me through meetings, who to talk to, who was bad news, who would be a good sponsor.  They held me accountable for bills and picking up after myself.  I can't express how being around other addicts in recovery helped me in my living situation.  It's a constant consistent reminder of my situation in a good way, that there is hope, and that there are other people with a common problem so care nearby. I can bring anything to them.  It's not ""college for junkies"" and if that happens generally the house is shut down.  If you go the way of recovery houses do some research. If you have any questions feel free to message me and I'll give you my number. Anything I can do to help I will.  Hang in there! I will say a prayer for your son tonight. "

GreenGemsOmally,AskReddit,1390110768.0,"A lot of waivers were signed. We were basically treated like medical school students, and patient consent was ALWAYS obtained prior to students entering the room or working with the patient. I was rarely turned away from a room, but when it happened there was always something else to go observe. We had our own hospital IDs and short lab coats and were treated a lot like staff, and the students all behaved very professionally. It was an awesome opportunity and the students were generally selected from the best of the best of our class of seniors. I don't think most seniors would have been able to handle the program maturely, and the selection was very competitive.

Scrubbing in was one of those kind of unspoken things, because in case of a problem it would be on the physician's liability. Typically, we were just observing but it was such a small hospital and small town that most people were comfortable with students learning at the guidance of the medical staff. We were all very fully trained on HIPAA procedures and took medical confidentiality very seriously.

As far as the still births and deaths, every student had a variety of experiences that impacted us emotionally. Being selected into the program was pretty competitive and there was a series of interviews to gauge your emotional stability. Seeing death for the first time was absolutely a unique and difficult experience, but there was a lot of emotional support and time to discuss what we saw. It was hard. Very hard. As a high school senior, it was sometimes seemingly overwhelming but I still always wanted to jump back in even after seeing something that I'll never forget. 

Our teacher had been teaching this program for a long time and he was always very supportive, very caring and comforting, very honest about how this program would push our boundaries, but he was very committed to us learning a lot from the program. He always said ""bad things will always happen to good people. If they're going to happen, I want my students to gain something from it.""

We would go on rotation 3 days a week, and the days we were not on rotation we had a classroom to ourselves that was just our group, and we'd sit and discuss what we saw. A lot of tears were shed, a lot of stories were shared, a lot of anger and frustration but it was a great atmosphere to be in.

It was absolutely the best thing I did during my high school career. I  have memories of a patient that I sat with for about 4 days in a row before he passed over the weekend, hearing his life story because he had terminal cancer and I had been following his case for about 4 months. From surgical diagnosis to chemotherapy into hospice, I followed him and sat with him for several hours each day because his family didn't pay him much attention. I wasn't there when he eventually passed, but the nurses made sure to call me when he did. It rocked me emotionally and really shook me to my core. But then, I have memories of witnessing a baby being born or seeing a stroke patient take his first unassisted step after 3 months of rehab, and it made it all worth it.

I may have decided I never want to be a clinician or care provider, but the New Visions program was the best thing that could have happened to me during High School."

No, the media has not told me that thin is attractive, nature has instructed me to think that. Since the beginning of time it has been more attractive to be healthy and in shape. It shows that one has good genes, is able to bear healthy children, and is able to care for said children by keeping up with them. 
And I know my husband would still love me if I were fat. We have discussed it. But he would not find me physically attractive and would not have sex with me. I have the same opinion for him. We both find healthy and smaller frames attractive. 20-30 extra lbs is fine. If he were to gain 50-100lbs I would be disgusted, and would not have sex with him. I would live him, because he is still the man I married, but we both have preferences in physical appearance, and fat disgusts us both. "

prairie_girls,Calgary,1390110998.0,"Sitting in a robe eating free (well, $300) cookies, drinking tea and reading magazines is the best thing ever.  It's all part of relaxing.  A lot of spa services like massages and body wraps can be dehydrating so it's good to take some time to sit and sip on something between treatments, and it's so much more fun to do it in a nice, relaxing environment.  I don't know any women who like to be rushed from treatment to treatment.  As well, the facilities in the change rooms like infrared saunas, steam rooms, crazy-ass showers, etc. are all part of the spa experience as well; lots of spas encourage you to arrive at least half an hour early just to use them. 

The best services are consistently at Riverside, in my opinion.  However, if you weigh facilities at 25% and services at 75%, I would say that Spa Ritual's facilities are nice enough to give it a slight advantage.  I've never had anything but professional service at either.

The general rules to get ""bigger clouds"" is to get more airflow, increase the power to the coil(s), and get more juice to the coil(s).  Without knowing what you're already running for coils, batteries, wicks, and airflow there is really no further good advice to provide.

I could say to build a 0.6 ohm coil when you're already running 0.4.  I could say to run a 0.2 ohm coil and your battery could literally blow up in your face.  I could say to run dual coils when you already are.  So the picture just shows the most basic information, but really tells nothing useful about your build.

On a side note, a carto is just the equipment to run for big clouds, the dripper is."

Your brother got in trouble because he caused a huge uproar in the school. Those that were bullied reported that they were bullied because they were put on your brother's hot list. In general a Hot or Not list is considered bullying and discrimination. 

For your question of his ""rights"".
Your brother did not have to login to his facebook but he chose to. What I mean by chose to is that he had the option of waiting for your parents or an attorney but did not. No matter how much the principal demanded he sign in he did not have to do it; he had control of what actions he could do. 

Summary: Your brother created a list which resulted in bullying which makes him the ringleader (his intentions do not matter). Your brother had the right to not login his facebook but did not use that right and logged in to his FB for the principal.

Corbenik,whowouldwin,1390111142.0,"I don't know much about Captain America, so this could be really off-base. Feel free to correct any mistakes. This seems like a very close fight. It's worth noting that Wrath fell into water, if I'm thinking of the same fall.

Challenge one should go to Captain America. I'd say that Wrath has better speed feats and similar healing feats, but Captain has him beat on strength and durability. Wrath doesn't have many strength feats and he'd have to be beating the captain pretty hard just to hurt him.  Wrath has peak-human physiology, but a punch from the captain could easily break a couple of bones. The eye comes into play, but I believe the captain can move fast enough to overcome it. 

Challenge two goes to Bradley. He's just way too good with a sword. He cuts the bullets fired from the gun, dodges the dagger completely, and avoids the shield after he breaks a sword against it.

Challenge three goes to the Captain, assuming that neither commander can take part. Wrath won his major battles by either sending an overwhelming force to take care of the problem or by personally participating in the battle (which turns his side into an overwhelming force). He's a good tactician, but the captain is an (almost) superhuman tactician with actual strategic feats.

For funsies, I'm assuming young Wrath for the Bonus Round. I'm also assuming that they keep their personalities.

Wrath *destroys* most of the captain's early villains. You'll see no enemies escaping. Wrath wouldn't be admired, he'd be feared. People would piss themselves on the battlefield after realizing that he's there, and then they'd die. You'd have no remnants, no survivors. Those pesky recurring organizations? Slaughtered. INT based enemies that try to use psychological warfare? Slaughtered.

There's no blackmailing Wrath in this world. He has no wife, no child. He'd just a endless murder machine. There's no manipulating Wrath in this world, he doesn't actually care about the side he's fighting for. Or people in general.

His killing spree slows down once we get to other hero's enemies, flying enemies, etc. It doesn't stop, and as new tech is introduced he becomes more and more powerful, but he spends the majority of his natural life ending the shit out of other people's crimes.

Wrath with Captain America's morals does significantly less good. I would say somewhat worse than Captain America.

Captain America does great in FMA Brotherhood if he loses his morals, but not particularly better than (but also not worse than) Wrath. Captain America with morals is incapable of committing the genocides necessary to further Father's plan. He rebels and is killed by Pride."
Rig_Daddy,nonmonogamy,1390111158.0,"I've been part of the kinky queer crowd in San Francisco for a long time and have been part of three or four gang bangs, all fun.

One was a woman in her 40's who asked a bunch of bi/gay men until she had five or six who wanted to play. We met at a SM club here in town, her boy friend was organizing while she was playing. Safer sex. Mostly just PIV sex with lots of lube while she had used vibrator.

Another was a younger woman (20's) with an older Dom (40's). He was well known and well liked by many of us and he arranged a 'special party' in his dungeon. He blind folded, bound and 'arranged' her for use by us, making sure she fluffed one while being done by another. She was in haze with so much simulation but still loving it. I saw her a week later at a play party and she was glowing and bragging and never know I had participated.

Those were the best two.

I also went to one in a hotel room where the husband found guys on craigslist. A friend answered the ad and talked me into going. The woman was in her forties and her fetish must have been just endless men as there must have been 20 guys or more that night. That one was much less fun. For the most part the guys didn't know each other or the host/hostess and where just there for the sex which really wasn't any good.

A gang bang with fun guys and good control and setup can be a blast!

Caution though, one guy being a jerk can ruin things so there really needs to be someone other than your wife in strong control.

Weddle this year is being taxed because of the scheme he's in and he's better off the LOS but a man can only do so much. Earl last year was very good but still had some improvement to do in the run game and he bit too hsrd in the passing game often. In his first two years he just wanted to make a play every snap and was all over the place in a bad way. 

This year he's playing much more polished in all facets.  He's taking over games and is a true leader of the team. He geeked out in the film room like Shermam over the off season. 

Anyway, with Byrd out most of the year and Weddle's performance being degraded due to the chargers' needs, Earl kind of took the torch. 

To answer your question, Earl might  be more talented altogether, but Byrd was the better player last year.  So it's futile to guess who the better player is now because Earl is a lot better than last year and Byrd was out so idk."

unicornbomb,RedditLaqueristas,1390111601.0,"I've been helping my mom break this habit. Committing to at least 6 weeks of weekly shellac manicures has done WONDERS. 

I do them for her so I know what I'm dealing with, but make sure you look for someone who knows what they're doing and will help you reach your goal of growing out your nails. Some nail techs aren't willing to work with  such short nails, but the good ones will understand and help you out. 

With shellac, her nails are protected and its much harder for her to bite. It also provides a little strength while the nails recover from all the years of abuse. I think its a better option because it doesnt compromise the integrity of the nail underneath like a lot of fake nails do. 

I also got her a bottle of CND solar oil and have gotten her to use it religiously on her nails and cuticles, multiple times a day -- morning and night, after showering, washing dishes or hands, etc.

keakealani,singing,1390111758.0,"So, I think I have a lot of thoughts about this, so bear with my potentially wall of text post. 

1) I mentioned this in the other thread, but I think we could benefit from talking a bit about genre/style. In particular, I think there are two competing issues here. One is overly broad questions that don't make any indications about genre/style in question, which end up getting responses that aren't helpful for the OP due to being related to a totally unrelated genre. The other is overly narrow questions/critiques that demand only answers from those extremely familiar with a relatively narrow genre, and no way to discuss if you aren't already familiar with that genre. 

I'm not sure how to handle this, but I feel like it would be great if people both made an effort to give some idea of their background/needs (this goes back to adding text to the post rather than just a title question), but also to phrase questions and discussions in a way that work for a variety of different genres and styles. Even if it isn't immediately helpful to the OP, others who might be searching through older posts might find it helpful. 

2) I really, really wish we could encourage people to respond to comments more. I find it extremely disheartening to spend tons of time writing a long, detailed critique, without even a ""thanks for the feedback"" response. This is *especially* true if I've asked questions within my comment/critique. Without any response, I have no idea if my advice was helpful and I don't ever get the clarification/details I may have originally asked for. As a result, I feel that I can't help as well and that my advice wasn't useful, which in turn makes me much less likely to critique. I'll admit, I've never been very big on critique (mostly because the vast majority of posts are outside of my genres of expertise) but it hasn't made me want to do it any more by feeling completely ignored. 

As part of this, though, I would love to encourage other users besides the OP to get in on conversations. I think it can be equally as helpful when one person posts a critique, and another person either chimes in to agree/elaborate, or questions/disagrees with something and explains why. As we know, singing is an inexact science and not everyone will identify the same problems or solutions. It can be really enlightening to hear from different points of view, and can create more engaging discussion for posters and better advice for those seeking critique. 

----

With regards to the specific suggestions:

* I understand why having a strict rule requiring certain info would be discouraging to newbies, but I think this can be implemented in a fair way. I would say it should *definitely* be required to put age/gender/rough level of experience. It's almost impossible to answer any question meaningfully without those pieces of information, so I really don't have a problem removing threads that don't even put that much. 

One thing that I'd ""almost"" like to require is the context of singing - whether it's for personal enjoyment, for a competition/talent show (and if so, what kind of competition), for public performance, or some other purpose. I'm not sure if this is as feasible to demand, but I also feel it makes a lot of difference in how to critique and answer questions. 

Beyond that, though, I would rather things be phrased in terms of ""encouraging"" additional info rather than ""requiring"" it. It would definitely be nice and I feel that critiques will be most helpful to everyone if they are more specific, but I also understand that some beginners don't necessarily know exactly what to ask. 

* I also think requiring text posts in general is kind of unobjectionable. Having a question only in the topic almost always means it's not enough information for anyone to discuss, so expecting some brief clarification/explanation isn't unreasonable.

* A bot could be interesting but I'm not sure how it would best be implemented. I'd rather bots not come and spam up threads that *do* include the ""required info"", but I'm not sure if it's possible to program a bot to discern that unless we expect the required info to be posted in a *very* specific way, which seems like it could end up causing problems for anyone who didn't exactly follow instructions but largely provided the right information. 

On the other hand, I think it's important to post and let people know why their posts aren't getting attention or have been removed, and I'd rather that come from a neutral source rather than a random individual poster nagging a new user to add certain material (which, frankly, is what already happens). I'm not a super tech-y person so maybe this is more possible than I'm envisioning.

* I actually don't know if I like the idea of having only one post for critique, unless it's only for general critique where other more specific questions can still get their own threads. I feel as if it will cut down on the top-level content substantially, to the point where the subreddit might start to look/feel slow, while simultaneously overloading the sticky with discussions that potentially cover a bunch of different things. 

In the vein of daily/weekly posts, though, I like the idea floated by /u/nemesmith and /u/YourLovelyMan to create recurring ""themed"" posts (which may or may not be stickied) for certain subsets of topics. In this case, perhaps a generic ""how do I sound?"" thread could fulfill this purpose - for those who just want someone to tell them generally how they sound, I think it's fine to throw them into one themed thread. But for more detailed/specific critiques, I think it's fine to keep those in the main subreddit. 

Anyway, I'll try to think of additional ideas, but I think with some organization, we could really get to the point where we provide the most help to the most people while also reducing fatigue and discouragement for those mostly seeking to help others and provide advice. Ultimately, this subreddit is only as good as its community so I absolutely think it's important to build a community consensus and get some solid plans in place. "

sturdyliver,Catholicism,1390111896.0,"&gt; I am not an expert on Theology or an expert of Canon Law but one time I've heard that his Holiness, Pope Francis said that ""Atheist can also go to heaven"" (I paraphrased).

The translation that I have seen floating around is this:

&gt; The Lord has redeemed all of us, all of us, with the Blood of Christ: all of us, not just Catholics. Everyone! ‘Father, the atheists?’ Even the atheists. Everyone!

However, redemption in Catholic theology is not the same thing as salvation. We are all redeemed, but that does not mean that we are all saved.

The Catholic Church has always taught that there is no salvation outside the Church. What is outside the Church is not easy to define, though. It's pretty easy to see that someone who is baptized, goes to Mass regularly, confesses their sins regularly, performs works of mercy, etc. is inside the Church, but just because someone doesn't do any of those things doesn't mean that they are outside the Church or will never have the opportunity to be united to the Church. We don't know. We have to accept that it is left to God's mercy."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,Fitness,1390112187.0,"Here are some suggestions about how to talk to her:

* Don't mention diet in context of calories or weight. Do not mention skinny people becoming fat. Honestly, don't mention food at all. Skinny fat people (like myself) do not respond to weight talk because we don't have to care about it. Diet change is very difficult for us because we don't associate food with our bodies. We think about food in terms of what we *want* to eat and with not wanting to feel hungry anymore. We reject talk of strict diets (calorie counting, macros, etc) because those are annoyances that we have had the luxury of not caring about and we are not about to start now. 


* Only mention her health, energy levels, and overall happiness. Let her know you've noticed a change in her overall health and happiness and that you are worried. That you feel there has been a decline in how she feels (that she seems stressed and unhappy more often than before), and you want to make sure that everything is ok. 


* Let her know that you care deeply for her and you would like to go to the doctor just to make sure there is nothing physical going on. Mention that there has been enough of a change that you are worried. If she seems hesitant you could always offer to get tests yourself and make it a ""couple gets their health checked out"" day. This could take the attention off of her and make it less of a ""I think something is wrong with *you*"" and instead ""let's make sure we are both healthy because we love one another"". 

Going to a doctor to get checked should be the goal of the conversation. She needs to get medically checked out. Her symptoms could be a sign of a medical issue and should be checked. I will say anecdotally my sister in law had very similar symptoms and after 6 years of decline (lack of energy, loss of sex drive, etc) she found out she had thyroid problems. Once she was put on medication she improved. It may not be something that easily fixable, but you need to find out first that everything is ok medically. 

Also, this allows for the doctor to be the ""bad guy"".  Let *them* be the person to tell your girlfriend that she has to change her diet. Let *them* be the one to tell her what she doesn't want to hear. You get to be her support system helping her out and the doctor gets to be in the position of the messenger (and no one likes the messenger).
     
**Important**: If the doctor reiterates any advice you have given yourself DO NOT GLOAT! Do not even make any facial expression that in any way resembles the thoughts of ""That's what I said"" ""I told you so"" or ""See, I was right!"". This will only make her hate both of you and less likely to change. Only react with the expression of listening to the doctor like you have never heard any of it before and are just taking it in and learning. Be the bigger person and don't try to get credit for being right, only concentrate on helping her get healthier.*

If the doctor finds nothing physically wrong then depression is a very real consideration and therapy should then be the next step. Again, this is a much easier thing to suggest after a physical check up because it is a logical next step. Also, the doctor may be the one to mention it first (again, being the messenger). Depending on the person, if therapy is brought up first they can become defensive and think you are telling them you think they are crazy. 

Good luck. You are a good boyfriend for doing everything you can to help her. Having a support system like you is priceless and she is lucky to have you in her life.

It is, of course, an anachronism.

Privileging women because of their gender is how most men were raised by their parents (in my case, by my Mother) but a small minority of women do not want to be treated that way. And while you may aspire to be a ""leader of your family"", this is of course patriarchal. And a larger number of people support equality of genders, not privilege based upon having testes, or indeed, having ovaries.

So I note your desire to replicate the structures of the past, but as Bob pointed out, the times they are a changin'. If I can mashup two of Dylan's songs, how many times can you allow your emotions to be trashed by a woman who suspects your motives are connected to your pants, not to your sense of honour, your sense of chivalry, before you accept that women are fallible human beings and should be treated as equals, not placed on a pedestal?

The answer, Mr Mann, depends upon how soon you replace your commitment to chivalry, with a recognition of the need for equity."

bloodandkoolaid,AskWomen,1390112305.0,"&gt; I often notice a switch when men are talking to me in their ""pick-up"" voice and when we hit on some ""real"" topic, they move into their ""real"" voice. Makes me feel like they treat me differently when they see me as an actual human person vs. a sex object. Therefore I avoid guys who have that switch and am attracted only to those who only talk in their normal/real voice to begin with.

THIS. I can hear it in a dude's voice when his entire reason for approaching me is to try to get his penis in me. Like I'm a challenge to overcome rather than a person. I always feel like their tone is vaguely contemptuous, too. 

I like it when a guy starts chatting with me like I'm just a potentially cool person, and if we get along then we can start ratcheting up the playful flirtiness.

Some questions:  
  
1. Will you give some discount price for educational institutes/students?  
  
2. If this game released on steam, I guess there'll be languages DLC?  
  
3. Will you add some more interesting features? I think the airship remote control is a good idea :)

ChangloriousBastard,AskMen,1390112556.0,"You're very similar to my girlfriend in a lot of respects. I think she likes me because I try to be a good person, but it doesn't hurt that I'm active and in to the same things she is.  She's on the fence about having kids of her own, but she's really open to the idea of adopting.

If I wanted to meet more people like her or if I wanted people like her to approach me, I don't think I'd want to meet at the gym. People who meet at gyms typically are not interested in the same kind of relationship I'd go for. If I were single and a girl was trying to hit on me, I'd be skeptical. That could be unfair prejudice, but I think hitting on a person at the gym isn't any different than meeting someone in a noisy bar.

Honestly, the best place to meet would be in some sort of fitness class, on the bike/running trail, in the produce section, at the bike store or somewhere outdoors. 

I met a lot of fun people when I joined a marathon training class, and I was not at all suspicious of their intentions. Similarly, if I were browsing the bike store and a girl came up to me and asked for my thoughts on a bike, jersey, or just a fun place to ride, I'd be more than happy to start a conversation and I might even ask her to coffee.

A lot of the people in my life who I consider to be good guys aren't interested in the whole game of picking up a girl/guy. They're more than happy to meet new people and build relationships, and that's a subtle but important distinction. Fairly or unfairly, the gym is seen as a place for cheap pick ups and it's not really a place I'd want to meet a girl."

We all knew Heaven took her body after she died. It was just a Catholic technicality whether you needed to actually believe it to be Catholic. But everybody believed it anyway.

Inconspicuously_here,pics,1390112802.0,"Your ideas of the human body are so off... pray tell, if being fat is so good for us why does it cause so many health issues? Our bodies crave natural sugars and salts and good carbs that you find in fruits, veggies and lean meats. Not twinkies and deep fried fat! 
The sculptures you see there are not advocating being fat. The sad thing is and obese person back them was closely related to the average 10-20lb overweight person. Not obese. Being a little plumper was attractive because it showed wealth and social standing. 

I never said being skin and bones was what we naturally crave in a partner. Yes, breasts and hips show fertility, but that is in the form of an hour glass figure, someone with defined waist, hips, and chest. Not someone with fat rolls where you can't tell where one section starts and the other ends. 

And as far as my relationship, getting old does not bother us. We can't control the natural aging process (losing skin elasticity, muscle tone etc.) But we can control to a point our weight by watching what we eat and staying active. Age will not cause our relationship to suffer, not putting effort into ourselves and making it a point to stay as healthy as possible will.

* Drink plenty of water/fluids.

* Get to the Airport early

* Check in online, this lets you choose your seats as well. 

* Take some kind of medication with you, like a painkiller for headaches and things like that.

keakealani,musictheory,1390112900.0,"I think both approaches are valid, but unfortunately a lot of instruction on harmony fail to adequately emphasize the value of voice leading in understanding tonal conventions. Counterpoint, obviously, relies heavily on voice leading, and therefore becomes a self-explanatory method for understanding both tonal and modal harmonic conventions later in study. However, I think an emphasis on harmony can help theory become accessible to those with more background in pop styles that rely heavily on block chords and harmonic movement, as well as give tools to students for analyzing a broader range of music that can be parsed down (more or less) into a chorale-style texture (which includes a lot of classical piano and orchestral music as well as literal chorales)

I would absolutely agree that both harmony and counterpoint are crucial to a well-rounded education in Western music, but I think the problem lies much more in the way harmony is taught without due emphasis on voice leading than necessarily on the fact that harmony can't be valuable to learn first.

2edgy420me,loseit,1390113456.0,"Personal opinion here: if you're to the point to where your weight is a health problem - I see nothing wrong with having medical assistance. It's no different than any other procedure to fix a medical problem. I *do* however hate to see people have surgery for weight and just go right back to their bad habits because they think the surgery will magically still help. Losing the 75lbs prior is amazing and I'm sure it took a lot of hard work. Losing the weight after is *just* as hard and is, in no way, less validated. 

I know no one has spoke negatively in this thread about it, but I often see a lot of hate (not on here, just in general) toward people who get weight related surgery. Too many people just don't keep up with themselves after, which seems to give it the ""easy way out,"" or ""lazy"" stigma.

That's a crazy amount of weight you're working off, and even though I have no idea who you are (and vise versa) I'm extremely proud to hear about it! I know that sounds cheesy coming from a stranger, but it makes me happy to see posts like this. Not just the surgery thing, but people showing how losing several hundred pounds is possible with dedication and hard work. It's very inspiring. Especially to someone like me who is just trying to lose 40-50lbs. It seems like an uphill battle, but damn - if someone can lose weight like that, I'm obviously not trying hard enough!

Congrats to you and OP! Thanks for coming on here and making me feel lazy (haha) and making me wanna work even harder."

They certainly would if you paid them! But maybe you are wrong. The internet has moved on, and most women would not do what you suggest unless that is their expectation based upon the context. For example, Omegle might be appropriate, but an online dating site might not.

&gt;But I've ruined my sexuality, and I don't know how to fix it.

Why do you say that? From time to time, most men yearn for the days  when they were single, or more virile, or girls were abundant etc.  That is natural and understandable. 

&gt;Nowadays when I look at women at the store, women at work, or anywhere, I fantasize about their nudity. 

Me too. As does every other man. My suggestion is that you have two choices. Compartmentalise your life, and indulge your secret fantasy without disclosing this to your wife, or be open to your wife and create a fantasy role play between the two of you, in which she indulges in the same role play.

No one can tell you what is right for you, but I wonder if you are experiencing a sense of getting older, of the migration from youth into the middle years of your life? Of course I could be wrong, but I can relate to what you have written. For me, the sexual yearning is a symptom of my desire to remain virile, and cherish tight, young bodies.  I will never lose that desire. Nor will you; all that will change is how you deal with it. I wish you well on your journey..."

Noxyt,howtonotgiveafuck,1390113639.0,"Hi. Just wanna give my two cents on ""Fake it till you make it."" I don't really like that. It implies that you have no value. Everyone has value or is good at something. I don't care what you're good at, just realize that it's something you do well. I used to have a low opinion of myself. Then I realized I was good at things. This may sound narcissistic, but whatever it is that you're good at, bask in it. Revel in it. Tell your friends how damn good you did that thing. Believe in it. Get so good at it that people immediately think of you when they hear about that topic.

If you already have that sort of skill, even better. Keep doing it. If it's cooking for example, invite friends over to make them lunch. Pat yourself on the back in front of them with how difficult the dish was to make, but you are still skilled enough to do it.

""Fake it till you make it"" is a flawed idea. I'd revise it to ""Believe it to become it."" Sorry it isn't as catchy, but at least you get it through your head that ""Fuck I don't have that girl I've been crushing on, but at least my goddamn lasagna shits all over anything anyone else could make.""

For me, realizing I can do certain things better than others is an immense source of satisfaction, which in turn breeds confidence and happiness. "

Man, if only we could erect a few more poles here and there, then we could solve that problem. Oh well, I guess that's literally impossible. Damn.

No, what we do is have reasonable zoning laws. If this restricts competition then so be it, but then we have to make sure businesses play by fair rules.

Also, what makes you think in a free market ISPs wouldn't try this crap? Look at what happened with bandwidth caps. Look at what happened with cable. When you respect property rights in general, whether intellectual or otherwise, YOU RUN THE RISK OF HAVING MONOPOLIES. THis is why libertarians seem to live in fantasy land because they either believe in NO state, or they believe in this weird state that respects property rights...but only in some situations and not others, etc.

Wake up. The world is not an economics textbook. I took economics. You know what's an important disclaimer to those models you learn about in those kinds of classes? That they operate under specific assumptions, and while valid conceptually in order to give you a general idea for how things work, they DON'T necessarily work that way in real life. Yes, regulation affects the free market...sometimes in good ways, sometimes in bad, and sometimes we just need regulation for reasons not pertaining directly to economics but these regulations affect economics. But the ""free market"" doesn't necessarily act as the on paper models suggest. COmpetition doesn't always undercut the businesses for example.

Heck, speaking of competition, it's a lot like the prisoner's dilemma. If you screw over your competition, you can get short term gains, but since someone will undercut you, you'll get long term losses. if no one cooperates, everyone loses. if everyone cooperates, you might not maximize short term gains, but you do long term gains, as you dont engage in races to the bottom, blah blah blah. That being said, if ALL ISPs agree to have these kinds of practices in order to maximize long term gains, no one is gonna undercut them because it'll lead to a price war.

PLEASE stop buying into the BS concept that regulation is ALWAYS bad. I have trouble taking people seriously who believe this, because they've either been listening to some libertarian whackjob sources, or they're intentionally dishonest. Is regulation perfect? No. Is it necessary at times? Yes. Try to view things in a nuanced, complex way, because the world is a nuance, complex place."

flyersfan314,PoliticalDiscussion,1390113887.0,"There are a lot of interesting points in this article from both what appears to be a liberal side and an an-cap side. 

From the ancap side I see a point that the governemnt did help ATT hold a monopoly. Although this is not the case today it may still be having a negative effect on our internet service. I think the problem with this argument from my standpoint is that I am happy with my internet. Could it be better? Sure, there is always room for faster and cheaper internet. But I am not convinced the market would make that happen. We have not seen another country try that. There just are no 100% free market economies in the world and I am not willing to risk it in America. Even in a complete free market it would still be expensive to create the infrastructure without governemnt subsidies and possibly without government security or property rights depending on how far you would go into ancap philosophy. My point is I am highly skeptical the pros would outweigh the cons. 

I do agree we need less local regulations that increase the costs.  I do not know a ton about this issue but from what I read there are a lot of regulations on internet companies. However I think the advantage of removing them may be overblown. "

aslucerne,Paranormal,1390114107.0,"One summer when I was 14, so 6 and a half years ago, I was staying the night at my grandparents' house but it was just my grandma and I there. It was about midnight or so and my grandma was already asleep and I was in the computer room and the only light was coming from the computer screen. Their house was kind of U-shaped with the right side being longer. The entrance was at the bottom of the U and the left side of it was the master bedroom/bathroom and the right side was the rest of the house. When you enter, the living room is to the right and then there's a long hallway and first is the computer room, laundry room, then the kitchen and dining room. There's another small hallway that hooks off of that where the other two bedrooms and bathroom were. I had heard a noise coming from that second, smaller hallway and I went to go check it out. I didn't turn any lights on in as I was walking that way and as soon as I turned the corner into that hallway, something hit the wall so loudly directly in front of my face. I ran away and my heart was racing. As soon as I calmed down, I went back and turned on all the lights. They had a lot of paintings hung so I thought it might've been something like that that had fallen but nope, everything was in place. I have no idea what it was to this day. Other weird stuff happened in that house pretty often too. You'd hear weird noises that didn't make sense, the lights would turn on and off even though everything was newly remodeled. It was just creepy."

bahloknee,personalfinance,1390114119.0,"&gt; It didn't help that I shared one room with my teenage brother and sister who's a year younger than me. 

THIS. I (M,23) currently share a room with my 16-year-old brother and it kind of bothers me that at this age I'm still sharing a room, not only because I don't feel like I really have my own space but because I can't muster myself to share this with any of my friends, or anyone I meet, at all. It feels quite embarrassing to share and I feel like I'm not grown yet. I'm in my last semester of college and I feel like this is one of the biggest contributors to my negative mentalities about my dating/social life, but also the fact that I am not really going out and meeting people as much as I feel like I should because of it. Being at home for this long (never lived anywhere else besides with my family) and my recent discomfort of staying in one place has given me an itch to move on my own and start doing things on my own. But there's only so much you can do when you're still at the yoke of your parents.

PathologicalWorker,AskMen,1390114126.0,"I spend months away from my wife due to work so I send her love notes via email and sometimes snail mail. I keep it up while home like when I leave for work in the morning I will drop one in her purse or tape it to the mirror.

I always try to show her when she gets home from work, which is usually after me, how much I have missed her and how much she means to me. We have a bit of a routine in this sense but I don't mind and I know she enjoys it. She gets home, we chat about our day and then I send her upstairs for a bath. I cook us dinner and after we eat, we spend the night curled up on the couch. She spends most of her day on her feet so I throw in the occasional massage, and to the best of my ability I try to get anything in return. I am a guy so it doesn't always work out that way but I try keep it as close to PG-13 as possible just to show I care. 

I live in AK so the winters are spent infront of the fire or driving to see the northern lights when the weather is right. The summers are spend on the beach infront of a bonfire. It isn't every night but usually once a week and it is nice to just enjoy eachother's company, drink whiskey/wine, and talking quietly about anything and everything.

wolfram184,news,1390114286.0,"If, just before solving all of the world's water problems, you could be bothered to read the source that you got your numbers from, you would find the following paragraph:

&gt;Desalination typically requires large amounts of energy as well as specialised expensive infrastructure, **making it very costly compared to the use of fresh water from rivers or wells** (bores). Most plants today use fossil fuels as a power source, and thus they contribute to increased levels of greenhouse gases. The major technology in use is the multi-stage flash (MSF) distillation process using steam, but reverse osmosis (RO) driven by electric pumps is increasingly significant. 

[Drinking water in the US costs ~$2 per 1000 gallons, of which 15%, or $.30, is chemical and mechanical treatment](http://water.epa.gov/lawsregs/guidance/sdwa/upload/2009_08_28_sdwa_fs_30ann_dwsrf_web.pdf).  The electricity costs that you mention are ~$.38 per 1000 gallons of water, or almost a 30% increase in cost.  Sure that looks small per gallon, but when you consider the hundreds of millions of gallons of water at stake, those numbers add up.

Of course, this is ignoring non-potable industrial and agricultural water.  RO is already a significant premium when compared to the treatment of surface and subsurface freshwater, but when you take out those costs, the added price of RO goes up even higher.  (unless you want to put salt water on your crops, you're still going to have to go through most of the steps in the process)

So yes, desalination does cost ridiculous amounts of money.

It seems like an underlying plan that is working even if it is AAP doing it. 

I want to see modi in the PMs chair because he is a mature proven leader. His party has the maximum number of statesman in any national party plus they have a good ground hold with RSS supporting them. It is a huge thing if a party is able to move with a central ideology. 

I want to see AK do good in delhi. I hope he becomes more mature while governing. Even he has been holding the CM post for the first time.  Even we don't expect ourself to do awesome work in the first few weeks when we take a job. Even if we are self righteous. Lets be very practical.  

Also i do know that BJP is taking AAP seriously. It really has paid people working for it. A friend had gone to meet some of the actors for promotion and he is very much involved in BJP promotion in Delhi through CAG. He tells me some of these things. He gets paid good amount. 


I would ask everybody to be more serious in analysing and debating including myself.

Than we went to eat breakfast ( They had amazing food ) We were suppose to see a doctor once a day but they never came but once for me. (Was there for two weeks). We would have sometimes where we could call my family, but if we cried they made us hang up. I don't really remember alot. I knew we worked out alot. The nurses didn't give a shit about you. Granted, I was a teenager and I was mentally ill. Most kids there were on drugs and stuff, but I was actually mentally ill. They put me in the good people rooms upstairs, where I could turn off the light at night. I will never forgive my parents for putting me in that place. It just made whatever I have that much worse.

Most people never know I have it.  I actual try to get some of my students to consider white ink when they are off to get their name tattooed on their neck or something and they won't back down.

I of course trust everything you say but I am wondering if there is a place for all white ink tattoos.  

I am surprised it is considered a new thing.  I have been into them for 15 years or more and I am farther from the tattoo scene than you can imagine."

I know its a slightly morbid thought but, on your death bed you will have no one to answer to but yourself. If you can look back on your life and be happy then it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. You may not even be lucky enough to have a death bed to reflect on.

That's not sexist; it's science.  You will burn more calories in a day and you will gain muscle faster; both are key in weight loss.  Don't let that impact your eating habits in front of her.

They shouldn't have to, but it is a cherry on top if they have. Is an person from the middle of the third world with no sponsorship more interesting or someone who has gotten all the benefits that money has to offer? It also gives them complete ownership of their experience. They aren't the front for something else they are their won end.

&gt;Why then don't we promote amateurism for its ""purity"" in other fields?

I think we do. There is what a person does for themselves and what they are paid to do. Hobbies versus jobs. Do you find someone who makes a scientific discovery for their job more interesting or someone who does it as their hobby? Isn't that what the whole interest about American Idol was over?

Omega037,relationship_advice,1390115194.0,"You don't have to already be very close.

Half the point of dating is to get to know each other.  Often it is better to do so in a romantic frame of reference than non-romantic.

In other words, it is harder to get someone who sees you as just a friend to see you as something more than it is to get them to see you that way from a clean slate.

As for whether another guy would be better, that is her decision, not yours.  All you can do is be who you are and pursue what you want.  Leave the judgement about what she wants up to her.

Anyways, this is all just BS you are coming up with because you are scared, and you know it.  You know exactly what you need to do and if you don't, it is on you.

Until you learn to move past that fear though, you will continue to miss one opportunity after another and won't grow as a person."

porpoiseoflife,Chargers,1390115295.0,"Actually, I've got a funny story about something like this. It's just that she wasn't *my* mom.

I used to have a female roommate who was absolutely clueless about football. I didn't really mind, as it gave me something to do for personal time. Then she introduced me to her family, as I was a stranger in a strange land far away from the sunny shores of my hearth and kin. Things suddenly got interesting.

Her mom? Raiders fan from back in the Bo Knows days.   
Her brother? Chiefs fan from childhood.  
Her sister-in-law? Broncos fan from birth.  
Her roommate? Chargers fan from birth.  

Suddenly, the entire AFC Smythe was gathered in the same room. You can only guess how much trash-talk there was around the supper table when the family got together during football season. Every one of us had a story about our team that could put one up on everyone else. 

And all four of us could only ever agree on one single thing... Fuck the Cowboys. Every Thanksgiving dinner as America's Team took the field for their why-the-fuck-is-this-a-thing traditional game, we'd all razz and cuss at the television like we were in the NFC East or something. And on the rare occasion when it was an AFC Best team facing the Cowboys, it was unanimous that all personal team preferences were to be set aside during the game and cheer for our division mates against the most hated of all non-conference opponents. (At least pre-Eli opponents.)  

It was all a lot of fun. And, even more important for me, it was also a lot of family. We're not all in the shadow of Mile High anymore, but we still talk and trash-talk all over the place. 

Which reminds me... Does anyone know what member of The Show made the Eli Bighead? I'm pondering getting my next Christmas present for Kelsie a little early... With a Payton Bighead just like his kid brother's..."

jezusbagels,AskReddit,1390115508.0,"I think that when we die, our souls leave our bodies and return to the giant conglomerate energy being at the center of the universe, an entity comprised of all souls not currently in physical form somewhere in the universe. When a new being is born, a bit of this entity breaks off and enters that body, but rather than it being the exact same soul that came out of another person, it's an amalgam of countless others, so reincarnation happens in a much less linear path, making all living things connected.
I've never really believed in Hell (I used to believe in an afterlife, was raised Jewish) because I don't believe any person, no matter how wicked, could truly be beyond redemption.

I can't tell if you're being serious or if you're humblebragging.  If you're getting B's in math, you're hardly ""bad"" at it.  

I flunked out of my first college math class.  So I think *I* qualify as ""bad at math.""  It was so disheartening that I dropped out of college.

When I went back, I had to pass calc for my major so I tried again.  This time, I asked for help from my professors when I needed it, and did lots of practice problems.  I ended up liking it so much that I changed my major to math.

A big part of my decision was the awesome faculty.  Math profs (at least at my school and the dozens that visited to do guest lectures) are super chill and friendly.  They drop what they're doing to help students because they just fucking love math, and want you to love it, too.

I don't know how you got the impression that college profs are bad, but it's not generally true, and you're doing yourself a disservice by writing them off.  Developing a good relationship with *all* your profs is an important step to doing well in college.

The Gillis article strikes me as being off the mark here. Taken out of context it reads fine, but in context it's a terrible quote. And it gets there in a snarky, semantically bickering sort of way.

&gt; This remark of Wampole’s sticks in my head;

&gt;&gt; To delight in their losses and aim at them the question, “How does it feel?” will only trigger a cycle of resentment and plant the seeds for vengeance. It is crucial to accommodate the pain of others.

&gt; I agree with everything she is saying except the word “accommodate.”

&gt; They have pain. So do we. Pain, shame, and the violence it engenders is not limited to a race, or a sex, or an orientation. It’s something that affects us all. But why do the oppressed have to, according to Merriam Webster, make room for and adapt ourselves to their pain? So they won’t shoot us?

&gt; Seriously? ‘Cause that seems like blackmail.

&gt; We need to see their pain... [THE REST OF THE QUOTE YOU GAVE]

Gillis seems to have missed the point. The spirit of the Wampole article is to practice empathy. The main argument of the Gillis article is to not be deferential (a word that is used once). In the context of sharing growth (in the realm of gender issues) together. Of accepting those who are feeling disconnected and letting them know that yes, they too have a place.

In response she responds by saying no. Women, being ""the oppressed"", shouldn't have to make room for men, to accommodate men (conveniently ignoring the definition ""to provide what is needed or helpful""). They shouldn't defer, ignoring the fact that the first thing we do when someone is hurt is to stop and take stock of what they need. We defer to them. But that would be demeaning because that word can have other connotations. Not to mention that using ""the oppressed"" to identify women here is really the exact opposite of empathy. It's straight us vs them.

I don't like the quote because it seems to say that yeah, we can help these people who are hurting, but they have to reciprocate. Now I agree that we should all do that. But you don't make demands of the injured.

----

As for [the Salon article](http://www.salon.com/2013/04/25/how_can_white_americans_be_free/) the Richardson quote is originally from, it and the RadCentrist blog you linked (which basically just aped the Salon article only with gender instead of race)... their arguments suffer from some pretty major flaws.

The one that stands out to me is the idea that someone MUST first consider their otherness before engaging in... anything. That there is something wrong with failing to attach a racial identity to a character in a book. Because the author wants the universal things (issues in daily life) to stand out instead of being expected to develop an identity centered around race.

To me it reads like the author identifies strongly with her race and assumes that all others must necessarily do so. Except for white people. As though being white precludes one from having an identity. The gall of her, seriously. That's the argument at the crux of that article, of that quote. That being The Default means you don't have an identity. That you don't know what it's like to have an identity. And that until you can empathize with those who are different, who have color in their lives *through* their identities, you cannot in turn be recognized yourself.

----

Both of those quotes... really? Your pain can't be seen until you see others'? You shouldn't provide for others unless they reciprocate? It's selfish crap couched in gender/race rhetoric. Do your part for others. Men, find out how you can best further the cause of women. Women, find out how you can best further the cause of men. Of course understanding is going to be a part of that journey.

All of this comes together to your final point. That men should acknowledge women's endemic pain in order to receive their help. Men cannot understand (except academically) what it is to be a woman. Men cannot understand the nature of this pain you're speaking of (except academically). And academically... well the very existence of anti-feminist groups goes to show that not everyone can agree on really... anything in this space. So what's the point?"

Sahasrahla,fantasywriters,1390115933.0,"Thanks for sharing and good luck! Most people who want to tell a story never get as far as actually writing it. If this is your first time writing a novel (and I'm guessing it's definitely your first time writing a 2.4 million word epic) it will take a while to get something you're happy with. You'll likely go through many drafts of your first novel as you get better at the craft. Don't get discouraged; you're not just writing a novel but you're learning *how* to write a novel. No matter how many pages you discard no effort will have been wasted. 

As for what you've shared so far: 

You have a huge challenge ahead of you. You've lived with this story for 12 years and you know all there is to know about it, but your readers are coming in fresh. When they open to page one you can't count on them knowing anything more than the title and genre. This makes it tempting, especially with an extensive world and history like the one you've created, to open by giving the reader a literal introduction to the world by expositing on its history and mythology. Don't do that. 

All readers start a story with a certain amount of goodwill. This is how much attention they're willing to give your story while they don't care about it. And make no mistake: no one except friends and family will care about your story before reading it. As an author, you want to hook your reader before this goodwill runs out. It's a precious resource and you don't want to squander it. 

With that in mind, you can see what's wrong with the intro. The reader doesn't yet care about your world so they're not too interested in hearing its history. This *might* not matter if the history itself was sufficiently interesting and unique in the genre, but any reader of fantasy will have seen this kind of thing before. 

To make a comparison, if you've read *A Song of Ice and Fire*: this would be like starting that series with a history of the Children of the Forest, the First Men, the Andals, Aegon's conquest, etc. That might sound interesting if you've read the books, but the reason for that is that you already care about the world and its history. To present this backstory Martin gave it to us in bits and pieces, allowing us to be curious about it along the way and to get a sense of satisfaction when we learned it. 

More importantly, the history was actually useful in understanding things I already cared about. e.g. I care about Ned and Catelyn Stark, but I can see there's a cultural and religious divide between them. This division also exists between the North and the rest of Westeros. Learning about the Andals and the First Men lets me put this in context. What could have been a boring piece of world building is now interesting to me because it illuminates my understanding of the characters and of the politics of Westeros (which, in turn, drives the whole story). 

My advice for your intro is to cut it from the story but keep it in your notes. Add to it as you need to. In the story itself you can hint at the backstory and tease the reader with snippets of it. Set things up so that understanding the history will give them new insights into the story and characters. Then, when you do give a larger infodump, your reader will be grateful and read it with rapt attention, marveling at the deep and complex world you've crafted. 

With the intro cut that means the reader is starting at the first chapter you've given in the comments. Keeping in mind what I said before about a reader's goodwill, let's take a look at what you've written. 

&gt; This is not good, not good at all, the black robed figure thought to himself. He quickly hurried down the dark winding stone halls. Torches lit along the ancient stone works, the pillars supporting untold hundred's of feet of stone and dirt above him.

Right away I know something is wrong, so we have a bit of conflict. That's good. I know we're underground and the ancient stone works and torches tell me a bit about the setting and level of technology. I have some comments about what's happened so far, but I don't want to distract from more important points so I'll stick those at the end. 

&gt; He came upon his destination, taking one final breath of air, he gently touched the massive stone doors before him, the workings of the ancient magic stirred within them and without even a whisper swung inwards to allow him entrence. 

And now you've spent half your story so far talking about a door opening. Unless this is a *very* special door that's not good. You also tell me that your character has taken ""one final breath of air"", so now I'm waiting for your character to either pass out or explain why he can't breath in the room he's about to enter. You probably just mean that your character sighed and steeled himself before entering the room. 

Also, as a note on your writing style, be mindful that you're not telling the reader redundant or useless details. You've told me that the robed man ""quickly hurried"", but if someone's hurrying I assume they're moving quickly. You also said that the door opened to ""allow him entrance."" That's typically what doors do when they're opened, you don't need to remind me. Really, you don't need to tell me about this at all. 

Remember, the further your reader gets the less goodwill they have, so you want to hook them. Let's continue. 

&gt; Standing around a large wooden table were armored and clothed figures, all he recognized and were known to him well. He stepped into the sparesly decorated war room and walked slowly to the table, his fellows didnt even so much as raise there heads from there heated discussions. Drat, he thought to himself, this could get ugly, but then remembering who was involved, understood, he himself had to close his eyes and collect his thoughts on a few occasions since the incident happened. He listened closely to the argument that was now being fought a few feet from him.

After this people sit around a table and debate about ... something. There was an ""incident"", and something is ""at stake"", but as a reader I don't care. A lot of characters and political factions and such are thrown at me but I don't know who or what anything is and there are a lot of new and made up names to keep in my head. Nothing really draws me into the story and I'm not really curious about what's going on so I start to tune out and skim to see if the plot advances. I gather that something happened, it was bad, and the council of bickering people decide that it was indeed bad and that they should really do something. My hunch at this point is that the ""something"" they decide to do should be where the story starts. 

Basically, this seems like more backstory. Despite my harping on the point, though, I wouldn't suggest removing it at this point. Use it as a springboard to your story and keep writing. When you're finished your first draft you can come back and remove this. 

All in all, you really just need to keep writing. The more practice you have writing a story the better you'll be, and your early mistakes can be fixed in later drafts. One final piece of advice: separate from your story keep a file of thoughts on the writing process and craft itself. As you read outside advice or learn through practice use this file to help you keep track of what you've discovered. Thinking about your writing is at least as important as thinking about your story, and keeping track of these thoughts will help immensely. 

(Oh, and use more line breaks. It's usually best to start a new line for dialogue. Keep in mind as well that a page in a book is about 300 words which means many of your paragraphs are about a page long. That would make your novel read like a giant wall of text.)

As I said, I have a few more thoughts on your opening line, so let's take a look at that again: 

&gt; This is not good, not good at all, the black robed figure thought to himself. He quickly hurried down the dark winding stone halls. Torches lit along the ancient stone works, the pillars supporting untold hundred's of feet of stone and dirt above him.

I'll admit, I love a good opening. Done right it can pull the reader into your story and set up characters, themes, plot elements, etc. that are central to your novel. Done exceptionally well it can be something your reader will still think about years after they've finished the story. To talk about your opening here, let's compare it to one that shows up a lot when people talk about first lines they love. 

&gt; The man in Black fled across the Desert, and the Gunslinger followed.

This is how Stephen King opens the first book of *The Dark Tower* series, *The Gunslinger*. I haven't actually read them, but this line makes me want to. For a short sentence it tells me a lot. There's a pursuit. Who is the man in Black? What has he done? There's a Desert. Already in my mind I have the image of a solitary figure in black fleeing across bright yellow sands. That might not be what's literally happening, but the imagery is nice, and it's evocative of a man (fugitive? hero? villain?) against a harsh world. 

Then there's the titular Gunslinger. I know this is a fantasy series, so already that's something unique. Fantasies don't often have guns, let alone gunslingers, so now I'm curious about what kind of world this is. Already I want to know more, so I read on. 

I'm using this comparison because in some ways your opening is similar, but it doesn't give the same effect. You also have a man in black, but he's merely hurrying, which isn't as interesting as fleeing. You describe him as a ""black robed figure"". That's kind of nice, but black robed figures are a dime a dozen in fantasy, and why is it important to describe him this way? Is he mysterious? Well, no, I quickly learn his name and there's not really any mystery about him at all, so why try to trick me into thinking this guy is interesting? 

Aside from your man in black, you also have some hurrying like the two characters in *The Dark Tower*. Except, in that example, there's a pursuit which I assume sets up the plot of the novel. Here your character is just late for a meeting or something. I know there *is* some sort of conflict from the robed man thinking ""This is not good, not good at all,"" but the phrasing is cliche and it doesn't particularly make me *care* about the conflict. 

Then there's that business with the door, which I've already addressed. 

Really, when it comes down to it, your opening line doesn't really do much. It's okay, so as a reader you don't lose any points with me for it, but it's not really great either so you've passed up your first opportunity to impress me. 

One problem I think is that it feels more like you're describing the opening scene of a movie or TV series. The dark figure hurries down the fantasy-esque hallway. Where's he going? Why's he in a hurry? This set design is nice. He comes to a neat looking door and some cool special effects happen with it opening, introducing the viewer to the magic in this world. The camera pans and we see a group of interestingly dressed characters in a big room having an argument. And so on. 

Remember the medium you're working in. You typically don't want to write as if you're describing a movie in your head. The strength of movies is that they're a visual medium, but that means that what might work on the screen won't work on the page. Your readers have access to plenty of things to watch, so don't try to compete with TV and movies on their turf. Instead, read widely with an eye for what works in prose and make sure to use those tricks in your writing. 

(And one last point: watch [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQZqbGME5HY) video on torches. Don't use them to light your hallways.)"

Also, I suffer from pretty severe PTSD from my previous relationship and it tends to manifest in the form of really bad nightmares and insomnia, so he keeps me supplied in small amounts of trees and gave me my own tiny little pipe to smoke from so that I can get to sleep at night when he's not there.  He doesn't mind my messiness and he eats whatever I attempt and will always thank me for cooking for him (even when he helps make it).  I also have nerve damage in my shoulder from that same bad relationship and when it's really bad, he will massage me, or if it flares while I am driving, he will shift gears for me.  Most recently he told me that with his new job, I ""don't have to work"" but that I should finish school and do what I want because he doesn't want to tell me what to do.

&gt; AAS obviously for muscle gain, but it also has great weight loss properties as well. However, that can be pricey and many people aren't comfortable with the idea of sticking a needle in themselves. If you want to look into further cutting, check out clenbuterol. It has no scary side effects other than giving you the shakes. It is for weight loss, but also acts as a mild anabolic. Technically, it's used in Europe for people with asthma as it opens up your lungs quite a bit which makes it also great for cardio. You can buy it online as a ""research chemical."" It shouldn't run more than 30 bucks for a good 3 month cycle (2 weeks on, 2 weeks off), which all things being equal, will add an extra 2 pounds of weight loss a week on top of your current diet. Then if you want to get really serious, look into T3/T4, which also helps in weight loss, but can have harsher side effects, like feeling warm, and if you over abuse it -- aka, ""Don't follow the guidelines and take breaks from it"" -- it can temporarily shut down the natural production of it for up to 3 months. Most people stick with just clen as there literally is no possible negative side effects other than getting shaky hands and knees when you over do it. If you want to lose weight, you should be taking this. I don't care if you're a cow or just trying to lose 2 more pounds. It's increases weight loss while you play World of War Craft.  
Now, there is even harder much more rapid weightloss suppliments, but I wouldn't recommend those. There is something called DNP which can melt weight from you like it's nobody's business -- it doesn't give a single fuck about muscle or fat. It eats it all. Which is why most body builders only use it to get below 8 percent, understanding that they will lose some muscle along the way. However, overdosing on this stuff can be fatal (It's unlikely you'll get to that point but it has been known to happen). Basically this stuff prevents your body from breaking the ATP bonds in your cells, so your body has to work double time to get anything done. You can lose up to 5 pounds a week on this monster, however, it's not pleasant. You will instantly turn into a lazy/tire blazing hot furnace. Use it when you don't have shit to do all day, because you'll be sitting outside in the snow feeling like you have a flu. At least for me -- everyone is different. But again, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone since you could take way too much and end up overheating and dying. It's very unlikely so long as you follow the guidelines, but it's a possibility.

nostalgicBadger,INTP,1390116199.0,"I usually favor general quality of life upgrades over big, extravagant purchases. The first thing I did when I started making more money was overhaul my wardrobe, since a lot of it was getting worn out, and I wanted to stop dressing like a college student anyway. I started buying better food, better liquor and beer, enjoying being able to go out for dinner and not having to worry about whether I could afford it, etc. It's not that traveling isn't nice, but I'd say do it because you have a friend overseas who you haven't seen in a while or because there's somewhere you'd really like to go -- don't just do it because you're able to afford it now.

Also worth considering: how much are you setting aside? If you put aside 10% of what you're making every year into an investment account, you should be able to retire very comfortably. If you're already doing that, then maybe consider some more aggressive investments with some of what's left over?

Stop listening to what others tell you normal is. Everyone is different, and just because someone tells you something as advice or whatever, that doesnt make it true. The best years of my life are right now, at 23, working a meh job and being single. Am I deeply happy? No. But i have the ability to control my future, and for that I am happy. Yeah,  it sucks to be alone. But you can either sit around and mope, or find people who love you for you. A close friend of mine is very close to someone who sounds just like you. They are best friends and spend a lot of time together. 

If your friends make you feel alone, maybe its time to look around for some new ones. It isnt easy, but when i did this i felt much better about my life.

jmorlin,Watches,1390116289.0,"The three watches are an Orient Black Mako, a 1680 Rolex ""red"" Submariner, and a SRP 309 a.k.a. a 2nd generation Orange Monster.

The Rolex was the first of these three I got.  My dad handed it down to me a couple years ago as a birthday gift.  Seeing that watch on his wrist everyday while growing up is part of why I am now into watches.  Also knowing that he was willing to part with a watch he had worn everyday for 30 years so he could see me wear it meant a lot.  This is the most accurate watch in my collection.

The Mako was the first mechanical watch I had purchased myself.  Up until then I wore various quartzs and the Rolex.  It is a great little beater watch.  My only two complaints are about the crystal and end links, though eventually I'd like to replace the crystal with domed blue sapphire.

The last and newest of the three is the Monster.  Initially I hated the things, but they grew on me and now is a part of my collection.  I'll admit it is a bit of a novelty watch and can get away with the orange because all my other watches are black or blue.  It wears on the large size on my smaller wrists, but is still do-able.  It keeps the second best time on any watch in my collection.

Ok, so a shower at $.02/gallon costs $1.  That is ten times as expensive as the average in the US.  So assuming you take a shower every day, you will pay $365/year instead of $36.5/year. If you have a factory that requires some [400 million gallons of water a year](http://www.nestle.com/media/newsandfeatures/la-penilla), the water cost jumps from 800 thousand/year to 8 million/year.  Which is why Nestle invested millions of dollars in water-efficiency at this plant instead of building a desal facility.

RO is unreasonable except when you have no other choice.  This empirically checks out as, world wide, large RO plants only exist for a very specific reason, either due to extremely strict industrial purity requirements or a lack of freshwater.  Believe me, if Israel didn't need to build a desalination plant, they wouldn't have.  Because it is extremely expensive to both build and operate.

topgirlaurora,BDSMcommunity,1390116681.0,"yeah. don't waste your money on a cheapo. Get something that's going to last. Really, a ball gag is just for the classic BDSM look, I think. They're ridiculously easy to spit out. If you want that for a newbie, go ahead. But if you actually want some muffling power that isn't so easy to reject, get a different type. Idk how much you know about gags, but I'll share for the sake of sharing. 

* Bit gags are not just for pony play. They're ideal for pain play: biting the bullet, anyone?
* I really don't see the point of a ring gag, except for the drool factor. By the time they get big enough for oral, they don't fit the mouth. Drool factor seems to be the only practical side to anything involving an open mouth.
* If you want silencing power, you're looking for something to stuff the mouth. Pecker gags and inflatable gags are the way to go. Neither are everyone's cup of tea. Blocking the output of sound also means you're blocking the intake of air, and that can be scary. And some refuse to wear peckers. My boytoy is one of them. 

Shop around, do your homework, read reviews, both professional and amateur. Don't spend your money if you're not totally sure it's worth it. Look at a product critically. Think, ""how could I get around what this is trying to accomplish?""

Edit: There's a subtype of ball gag that has been sparingly called the pacifier gag.

Feminism isn't lying about shit. There's plenty of groups that say they couldn't give a rat's ass about men's issues and plenty who do, in fact care. And everything in between. And they are, in fact, all Feminists.

And wake up. Different groups are accustomed to different manners of conversation. And over here it's way more confrontational, way more accusatory. And that rubs people the wrong way when they're not used to it. That should neither be surprising nor really terribly upsetting to, well, anyone. That's how life works.

WalterFStarbuck,askscience,1390116981.0,"There are two different phenomena people could attribute to a 'trail of vapor' behind aircraft.

1) Water vapor in engine exhaust. There's a lot of air that is forcibly passed through turbine engines and combustion with fuel is going to result in some additional water vapor on top of the local humidity at altitude. The turbulence and rotation of the exhaust will cause that water to condense and form cloud trails.

2) The same sort of phenomena also occurs due to wingtip vortices. That doesn't just mean the vortices that form on a planes wingtips. They can also form at the edges of flaps, slats, stall fences, and small vortex generators. Any flat edge surface is likely to shed some form of vortex. The tighter that rotation is, the more likely you are to see the local water vapor content condense into what you'd refer to as clouds."

Levi is just awesome really..  The guy is the strongest in the Scouting Legion, he cut off his emotions.  One thing I really dislike about Eren is his tendency to cry..  You would think the things he went through when younger would shape him into something different but that's so far from the truth.  I am not saying he shouldn't have emotion, I personally just think Isayma did not think Eren character through.  The tragedy like that should realistically cut you so deep you shouldn't be able to function like a regular person anymore being able to ""feel"" for others shouldn't be possible.  ( Mom died in front of his eyes then when he needed his dad the most he injected him with something and to our knowledge and Eren's disappeared so he has no one to comfort him).  Bleh rambled...  

To the point!  Levi is just awesome to me, his character is great.  Not the tall, devilish handsome look most main characters would get but the absolute 100% thing that cemented why I love him was how he reacted to his squad's death and how he treats Eren like a younger brother.  His squad death he didn't cry but you could see the grief in his eyes.  To me at least it shows how much he's been through and how it's changed him.  Which is what I wanted Eren's character to be.  Not the exact same but to actually react to the trauma's he went through and actually show how it affected him, day to day.  Not to hope he live in self pity but to show it impacted him.  Only thing it did was make him hate Titans...  as in honestly."

That being said, my first time was bad. My wonderful boyfriend was willing to try with me and I was super nervous. We used no toys or fingers. It was straight dick with not enough lube. It was painful, he puled out too fast, I cried like a big baby. Still, we tried again, and again, and tried to make this work.

Eventually, I got a putt plug. It eased me into it better. and I started really enjoying anal. We got a thick lube and a couple more toys to play around with. Now, I love anal about as equally as PIV. It's a real treat for me. 

As for the poop thing, it happens. I'm lucky enough that we've never really ran into a big issue. I use the bathroom often, shower, I wear a toy all day and watch what I eat. She should use a toy for a few days and see how she likes it and ease into it.

Life-in-Death,todayilearned,1390117787.0,"It is actually really interesting and I should have explained it better.

So, scientists noticed that in large cities like Tel Aviv, there were much higher cancer rates (obviously, right?).

They somehow made a connection to ambient light at night time...apparently it is always fairly ""light"" there.  Their theory was that if you had light at night, your body wouldn't release melatonin (which is brought on by darkness) and as melatonin is a tumor suppressor cancer rates would rise.  

So to test their theory:

Mice + light at night = high tumor growth  
Mice + no light at night = no tumor growth    
Mice + light at night + melatonin = no tumor growth  

They have now started  human studies and are actually using it for cancer treatment.

So...right now, your cell phones, lap tops, tablets, TVs, etc. anything that you could read by (is the standard) turn off.  Go to bed.  In the complete darkness.  

Or take melatonin.

A grief counselor can give you the tools and methods to help yourself process what you are going through and build your life in a healthier manner than if you were just slogging through it yourself. Please, utilize these people to help make a terrible ordeal less daunting and manageable. 

Also, it may help to think about what if the roles were switched? What if you were the one to die and she lived. What advice would you give to her. What would your hopes for her be? Follow that advice. Also, what do you think she would tell you right now? Just because she isn't physically here doesn't mean she is out of your life. She has left an indelible mark on your life, and as gut wrenching as that can be, it can also be a comfort. She may have passed, but you haven't lost her in that you probably know exactly what she would tell you to do. She will still continue to influence your life and that is a good thing.

aznsk8s87,AskReddit,1390118904.0,"So I'm pre-med in my undergrad and my view of things is a little skewed. Most everyone I take classes with would make fine doctors, at least from an academic standpoint (as to bedside manner, that's up for debate).

That said, I know this will sound pretty snobbish, but when it comes to academic performance, we're a pretty unique group. We do well in not only our science classes but other disciplines, including the humanities and fine arts. This is a bit of an exaggeration, but here's a pretty common example at my school. Student A is a chemistry major, and gets A's in advanced chemistry, advanced biology, and sophomore English and History. Student B is an English major, and gets A's in advanced English, A's in advanced history, and a D in freshman chemistry. Freshman chemistry is one of the most failed classes at my university.

That's not to say that you need to get an A in freshman chemistry to be a good doctor (far from the truth), but a doctor needs to be able to understand basic science concepts. I might be biased as a biochemistry major, but to me, a solid understanding of biology and processes in the human body require a decent level of biochemistry knowledge, or at least the parts that are pertinent to human physiology as well as bacteria. I justify my C in structural biochemistry (a senior level class) in saying that doctors probably don't need to really know how NMR or X-ray crystallography use Fourier transformations in order to determine the structure of a protein, but they should probably have an understanding of Le Chatelier's principle and acid/base chemistry (freshman topics) as these things affect our physiological processes.

&gt;But I think it also speaks to an even bigger issue in modern society, which is how training has become very specialized, so you aren't expected to be able to understand what anyone you encounter is doing. Like, as soon as someone on Reddit says ""I'm a lawyer, blah blah blah"", everyone treats their word as gospel until another lawyer comes along and inevitably contradicts it. If you want to ask rational questions, you are usually told that amateurs aren't wanted.

I think this is a load of crap. With a little bit of google and wikipedia, people with access to these resources can at least gain a cursory knowledge of most topics, or at least know enough to recognize what they don't know and ask the appropriate questions. I don't think I've ever been told ""amateurs aren't wanted"" if I'm asking an honest question.

&gt;I pick up my car from the mechanic and want to understand whats wrong. Why did this problem happen, so that I can recognize it or avoid it. But they just want you to sign the damn bill of sale and get out of the shop.

You go to a shitty mechanic. HUE HUE JIFFYLUBE.

&gt;I guess I just wish more professionals would be willing to ""de-mystify"" their area of expertise to the layman, but there is often a profit incentive to keep people convinced that task X requires a professional.

HAHA it's hardly about profit. There's a baseline level of knowledge that so many people don't even come close to meeting in order to begin de-mystefying the subject. Then there's the issue that so many people don't actually care and just want the doctor to make them better.

For instance, I have a relative, A, who, bless her soul, tries to understand. Her husband B is a doctor, and we were visiting another relative C who was rather ill. The attending physician was explaining what was wrong, and relative A would try to relay it to C (she's pretty old and deaf), but would completely garble it up and get it out wrong and sometimes completely contradictory. B and myself at that point would just look at each other, shake our heads, sigh, and he was the one to make sure that relative C followed the physicians orders because A, despite her good intentions, would probably mess something up.

Sorry if this was a complete mess, it's 1AM and I'm tired."

If I google ""What difference does height make in a person"" and click the first couple links, they're saying that it makes a serious impact on your life.

The articles I looked at took them out of context and misconstrued the information by saying there is a difference, so it must be bad. Where from what I saw by skimming it was not the point at all.

Shamrock132,travel,1390118970.0,"Hi, airline employee here! The most important advice I can give is never never book through a third party site like cheap tickets, orbitz, travelocity etc. I have herd of and seen so many mistakes, such as booking a person on an itinerary that wont work, not putting seat requests in, or not giving the airline contact info leaving you totally out of the loop of flights are delayed, changed etc. Once you book a ticket through these websites, most times the airlines cant make changes, and you have to call the company that issued the ticket, even if you are standing in the airport, and pay any fees they might charge. These sites are okay to get a general idea of the ticket price, but always book directly with the airline you will be traveling on. 

Also, always look at the total travel time. While you might think you are getting a good deal by saving 50.00, you might also be buying an itinerary that has a 4 hour layover in Cleveland. 

Finally, airlines handle millions of pieces of luggage a day, and 99.9 percent of it makes it to where its supposed to go. However you can do some things to make sure your bags have the best chance of making it. Make sure your bag has a sturdy name tag. The little paper and elastic ones the airlines give are okay, but can get ripped off easily. Check the airlines bag allowance, most major airlines change 25.00 for a bag, but some like JetBlue and Southwest let you check a bag for free. Weigh your bag before you get to the airport. Most airlines have a limit of 50lbs. If you can, try and book a trip with the least amount of stops. Every time you have to get of the plane and transfer to a different one is another chance for your bag to get lost. 

As far as airline choices, since you're going to New Hampshire if you want to go non stop I guess you'll be going to Boston? So for non stop flights your choices are American, Virgin America, United and JetBlue. If all the prices were the same and I had my choice, I would probably pick JetBlue since they have the most legroom, an important factor for us tall folks, you get a free bag, and you can fly out of Long Beach or LAX.  

But thats just all my opinion. If you have any questions I would be happy to answer!"

Kmodek,AskReddit,1390119089.0,"When it was still bearable outside, I'd get up and force myself to go walk every chance I got.  I've walked over 7 miles many many times, just walking until I felt like my head was at least a LITTLE clearer than when I left. 

 I'd be ready to go home, but still feel all fucked up inside, so I'd just keep walking until it felt bearable.    Just keep walking and ignore everything around you.

A little background: 

My 15 year old daughter left to stay at her dad's for a few days and never came back home.  They'd been planning it for the past 2 years and pulled it off.  We were never married, so no court ordered custody or visitation because he was never involved and I raised her alone.

Now that she's into partying, boys, and weed, her dad lets her do it all, and that's what she fought with me about constantly.

So I haven't spent a second alone with my daughter since September, she's come by a couple of times with her boyfriend for a few minutes, and that's it.  She ditched our entire family for the holidays, which has ripped us all apart because my family is who she's been raised with, and suddenly for the first time in her entire life, she's not at home and she didn't even come visit our get together.

My dad is a complete wreck over it because she is his baby, even though my sister has 3 kids, my daughter is his girl because we lived with my parents for a year when she was newborn and me and her dad split up.

I can't even let myself really think about it much, because I just break down sobbing and feeling so helpless and angry and hurt that as soon as my brain starts in that direction, I run the opposite direction and smoke another hit or watch another movie.

Me and my boyfriend have been going back and forth for months, breaking up, 2 weeks go by, he calls or comes to see me, we hang out again, he does dumb shit, calls me again saying he doesn't want to be together, I go through all the crap of a huge breakup, and the cycle repeats.  It's been fucking AWFUL, because I make myself go through it like ""Ok, it's over, I have to get that adjusted in my head, etc."" and so I've gone through that horrible unbearable sadness/depression/anger/self-loathing, sick unhappy misery like 5 times in the past 6 months and I'm at the point now where I'm just disgusted and fucking SAD.

Just typing this makes me cry because it's just gone on so damn long and I'm so unhappy and miserable without my baby girl and that along with the pain and misery with my BF, the holidays totally sucked, and yeah, distraction, distraction, distraction.

This is why I try not to think about anything."

It's from Cabin in the Woods, far often overlooked, and is great for many reasons.

**spoilers below**

This is said when the head of Chem Department, Lin if i remember correctly, is talking with the two main controller's about how they're affecting the teenager's.  She made a mention about how they put chemical's in the hair dye and such, and makes the mention ""Chem department keeps their end of the deal up"" in reference to being told in the beginning that the one time they failed a Chem Department's fault.

The response was ""I'll see it when I believe it.""

Not only is that a good response to what was said to him, but it's much of what the movie is about too.  One of the most interesting parts was Marty figuring everything out early on, while everyone else is confused and doesn't believe him, despite the fact that there are obvious warning signs.

Or that they ignored those signs, even though it was all obvious stuff fans of horror movies would note as the stuff to take heed of.  They didn't believe anything could happen, and so they didn't see what they should have.  Just like Hadley ignored chem department doing good simply because he didn't want to believe.

Many people would claim it's not the best line, but it definitely has some merit that is far overlooked."

Simply take out the &lt;? and the print(), leaving all the HTML fine and dandy, then try learning some more about PHP to better understand it's purpose.

As for getting the result you want, you're trying to take a thumbnail image that's tiny and place it into an element with bigger dimensions that it really is, giving it the look that it has. Either replace the thumbnails that you're currently using with higher-resolution ones or take a look into image manipulation in PHP with either GD or Imagick where you could take the original ones and easily output them into thumbnail-forms, although I'd imagine that with what you're doing you'd get away fine doing all of this in just HTML and not in PHP, unless you want to handle logins, credentials, or any of that fun stuff regarding access to the page.

&gt;""Gender"" as a term may not exist in nature, but genders absolutely exist.

&gt;You're alive because there are two different genders. Every human is.

[You're confusing gender and sex.](http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/) In a discussion about trans* issues, it's very important to know the difference.  

Life is in no way dependent on gender.  Many folks lack a gender, and it would be entirely possible to live in a world in which nobody had a gender.

Gender is entirely a human construct, and to the same degree that gender (**not sex**) exists (i.e., only as an idea), so do dragons.

And while I don't pretend to understand the differences that you face on a day to day life that are different than what I face, I seem to have my opinions and more 'pro-active' and 'positive focused' ideas met with a lot of animosity here. Probably because they feel that I could not relate to their problems.

The Important thing to remember with any kind of farmers walk is that you have to go heavy ass fuck.  By that I mean that after walking 20ft you should want to drop it, and if you can make it past 50ft the weight is probably too light for you.


People often just do farmers walks for grip strength and possibly some core stabilization, but in my opinion the biggest gain from farmers walks is the strength you can develop in your traps and upper back.  The key to that is again that you go heavy as fuck with what ever it is you choose to carry, and that you have good posture throughout the entire movement.  i.e. scapula pulled down and together, with your spine in a neutral position, and this is especially important for the thoracic (upper back) region of your spine


Hope that helped, good luck man."

That is their job. Their job is stressful, as are many other jobs, and that is not an excuse for inappropriate or illegal behavior. They are public servants meant to protect us and uphold the law and they should be able to keep control of themselves and not break the laws we trust them to enforce.

And yes, it isn't always a peaceful exchange when enforcing the law but that does not absolve them of guilt when acting inappropriately. 

I am not sure what you are referring to when you say 'cops aren't (going ) to take bull shit and tolerate nonsense' but I'm guessing you are referring to when civilians/criminals talk back to them or give them attitude. If so then why does the cop, in this situation, have the right to use his authority to solve what is now a personal vendetta since this person annoyed or insulted him. It is not illegal to insult a police officer so if a police officer uses his authority against you for annoying him he is abusing that authority. 

They should be held to a higher standard because of how important they are to society. They are meant to protect and serve and are given the authority to do so. However they are also somewhat of a self-policing industry, you call the cops if a cop commits a crime, and going past that when you get to court they are judged by other employees of the city. While this does not guarantee an unfair bias it can promote one and we should do everything to prevent that so we can weed out the bad cops who got into it to have some stereotypical level of authority and keep the good cops that will do their jobs without abusing the authority given to them to do so.

If you come in offside and score without losing possession, no goal. If the opposing team gets the puck, the incorrect offside call no longer matters. You can only take back a goal from a missed call without a loss of possession. Penalties not included, those should always just be the ref's discretion."

1. It's legal to smoke at 16 where he is.

2. He has stated that his parents know, don't like it - but are aware that he's allowed to make his own choices.

3. The point of **pipe** smoking is the aroma and flavor. You don't normally inhale. You hold the smoke in your mouth. Do some research before all you mother-hens go raving and ranting about smoking. It isn't a cigarette. It's not nearly as damaging. Also, I can guarantee half of you drink or something else. Everyone has a vice. Is it really such a big deal that he has one at 16. Stop assuming that just because he's 16, he isn't aware of what he's doing or that he's too young to make an adult decision. From his posts, he is clearly educated on pipe smoking and the slight danger (more so than most of the people commenting, which says *a lot*), he isn't hiding from his parents (so that kind of kills the ""cool"" factor I keep seeing), he's pretty intelligent and mature and really doesn't need you guys trying to be his parents. He has his own. If it becomes an issue with them, let them handle it. At least he isn't out getting drunk or doing drugs. He's just enjoying some plain tobacco.

4. Pipe tobacco has way less (or none, depending on brand) additive and chemicals than any cigarette. Seriously, you guys all just sound like you know everything when you don't know much about him or the subject at all.

Your beard is awesome, man. As a 24 year old female, I'm sad I wasn't lucky to have such good looking guys around when I was 16. Nor ones as mature. As a mother, I'm sure your parents are very proud to have such an intelligent, well spoken and polite son. If my son was as educated on the subject as pipe smoking as you at 16 and I knew he did it - I certainly wouldn't love it but I would let him make that choice. It shows character to make sure your parents know things even though they may not love it. It's also good to let kids experience different things in life and make their own choices. In the US it's legal to smoke at 18. If you were 18, no one would bat an eye. As if 2 whole years are like going from 12 to 25.

At that moment a brave pink-haired scene girl who had touched Beau Bokan twice in her life stood up and held out a picture.

“Hey, Professor, who is this?”

The arrogant neckbeard smirked like the white supremacist he was and smugly replied “It's one of at least 20 interchangeable scene frontmen. I'll bet his music is vapid and self-important, but you fucks probably gobble it up.""

“Wrong. It's a picture of Austin Carlile. Every second, he saves approximately 11.38 lives. Suck my fuck.” The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his copy of the Metal Archives. He stormed out of the room, ready to torture his eardrums with breakdown-free music. The professor then realized that, because he hadn't let Austin Carlile OR Oli Sykes into his soul, there was no way his life could be saved. He promptly accepted that Sleeping With Sirens and Portal are the exact same thing, and killed himself.

The students all grew out their bangs, subscribed to Alternative Press, and listened to the new Attila album. Will Swan, in the form of a majestic afro'd eagle, soared into the classroom and perched on the American flag before delivering a dose of funk.

You want to lie and cheat in the Empire, chances are you'll get taken out pretty quickly. The Republic is decaying from the inside. All these gangs taking advantage of the system. Hell, Corruscant is pretty much as lawless as Nar Shaddaa what with all the gangs, senators BACKING those gangs. This is why you spend the whole time fighting insurgencies in the Republic. Take Dromund Kaas in comparaison, and the worse thing you've got is a pathetic slave uprising that gets quelled pretty fast (and it was a Sith who orchestrated it), and the Revanites, a bunch of delusional heretics who think they can strike at the Empire. Gratham is a Sith who thought he was too cool for Sith school, and gets taken out for overstepping. There is a reason you never hear of them again, you took them out. Whereas you never feel you've taken out the gangs on the Pub side. You don't have slums in the Empire. As an Imperial citizen, you know you will not starve. Can the same be said about the Republic? I have never come across an imperial complaining about pay or try to get ahead for credits. They try to get ahead because it is a meritocracy. Some people are narrowminded and put that ahead of the greater good, however the Empire is a ""For the Greater Good of the Empire"" mentality.

Even in the last days of the Republic, the people are still starving, they have slums and gangs. With an entity as powerful as the Jedi Order, when there is no war to fight for a thousand years, you are telling me they couldn't route gangs out? The Empire has.

Darth Marr is what every Sith should aspire to be. If they follow him as our new Emperor and his ideology is implemented, I sincerely think that the Republic has very little chance."

Congrajewlations,nfl,1390121657.0,"It all comes to salary cap.  You have to pick your battles, you cannot afford every player that you want, and in the case of Welker, the Pats weren't willing to pay him the amount that he wanted (and the amount that Denver ultimately paid him).  It could also be that be that BB is gambling that Welker wasn't worth the amount.  Same thing with Randy Moss, who IMO was just getting older and less effective.  The reason why he was so deadly in the first year that he was a Pat is because people just didn't give him the respect that he deserved and he burned them.  After a few years with the Pats, his cost to the team outweighed the benefits that he brought, so he was traded.  I feel like BB milks his players for their best, and once they start declining or want outrageous amounts of money, he shows them the door.  And a lot of these players are able to be replaced (just look what Julian Edelman has been able to do this year).  Lastly, Gronk is a special case.  He's literally the most gifted TE in the league (and probably ever), and is Brady's #1 target at all times.  His production is what makes him worth the money, but we also don't want him going to another contender (like Denver, etc.) because he is a dangerous weapon for any team."

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1390122139.0,"Back up, despite his lack of experience my SO is amazing in bed, easily the best. No correlation between number of partners and ability to sex. My ex husband was a horrible lay and he had easily been with dozens of girls.  

So don't be worried, sex is about giving and communication and being in the moment. The no baggage part goes for sex too-my SO doesn't try to do me like his ex, he is trying to do me the way i want to be done, which is what all good lovers do.

The fresh breeze of the morning made my lips form a smile inside my bushy beard, my hair swirling in the air of dawn. 

**This is really weird imagery to me. It made me think of the wind blowing so hard it moved his lips. I know that's not what you meant, but it's what I pictured. I also pictured his beard swirling around in the gale force breeze.**

My hands still ached with the hard metal of nails that were thrust into the flesh of my skin. 

**At this point I'm definitely wondering if your character is Jesus and I'll be actively looking for clues to confirm that. I know it's not fair, plenty of people were crucified who weren't Jesus, but that's just the culture we live in.**

I hung at least fifteen feet high, and the cross that was wearing my body was slightly swinging by the rushing air that filled the waking earth. My cross stood in an empty field of grass and roses redder than the blood that was running down my weak body. 

**Jesus was crucified along with two other criminals and there were plenty of other people there as well. Rather than thinking this guy's not Jesus, I'm just thinking that you don't really know much about the crucifixion story. Again, it's not really fair, but if you put a bearded guy on a cross I'm going to think ""Jesus"".**

Nothing around but a tree pregnant with apples facing my direction. 

**At first pass I read this as ""teen pregnant with apples"".**

I closed my eyes and sucked the air until my lungs were full before letting it out. My only breakfast. No rain for two days and if water didn’t fall today I was likely to die. 

**I like the image of a starving man taking a deep breath and thinking of it as his ""only breakfast"". That being said, I don't think people who were crucified died of hunger or thirst. My understanding of this (having not looked anything up, because your readers won't leave the story to read Wikipedia) is that we don't really know exactly how they died, but it had more to do with how they were held up. Also, despite the Jesus thing, I also think people were typically tied to crosses rather than nailed to them. Supporting your body weight with a few nails won't end well.**

At least the anger that lived in me is long gone. If I was to die today it would be in peace of mind. Even if my body screamed in pain. The punishment and guilt I’ve carried I wouldn’t wish to my worst enemy, but sometimes a man must fight for what he thinks is right.

**Bearded man on cross who carries punishment and guilt that he wouldn't wish on anyone else. If this guy isn't Jesus there had better be a good reason why you're presenting him this way.**

Evening came quicker than I expected. Probably because I kept falling out of consciousness throughout the course of the day. My stomach kept grumbling furiously, the apple tree in front of me looked farther than ever. I drifted. Father, I could hear his heavy voice, singing. And an instrument… What was it called again? A Harp, distant, but father’s voice somehow closer. 

**Jesus. Jesus. Jesus.**

My bed was huge, a celestial featherbed which made you want to sleep just by touching its smooth surface. My room was white with a touch of gold here and there. The curtains made of the finest piece of cloth not even in the seventh Heaven you could find. I got to my feet and went for the door. Father’s voice louder and richer with the harp sounding so beautiful you could feel the notes dancing on your skin. Good he was, with his instruments and the vocals only a god could possess. 

**Okay, his father is god? Or, God? If you just mean for this figure to be a Christ-figure and not actually Christ you're laying it on a bit heavy.**

My hand reached out to touch the door handle but something made me stop. I rang my fingers through the palm and noticed the holes were gone. 

**The holes were gone? One of the important plot points when Jesus rose from the dead were the holes in his hands. I think one of the apostles even poked his fingers through them. And remember, I definitely think this guy is Jesus, so I'm blaming the author for things that don't make sense.**

Was I dreaming? This felt too vivid to be a dream. I was back. They’ve taken me back and I was sure of it. The door opened and Father stood before me. A man so tall you’d feel the strain in your neck if you kept eye contact long enough “Father? You’ve forgiven me?” No answer. He just stood there with that judging eye of his. His hair as white as snow. A face so aged but still so young “I’m sorry father, you must forgive me, for I am your only son left” Still no answer. 

**""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?""**

The tear that ran down my cheek felt oddly cold. His face took on a different note. Pity. I’ve seen that face one too many times. He began to puff his chest just like he does when he’s about to speak… I awoke to the howls of wolves. 

**Wait, he woke up and there are wolves? Was this all a dream?**

It frightened me in the first three days of hanging here but now it was the familiar sound you hear when night arrives… 

**Oh. Never mind.**

Something moved behind the apple tree. A rustling sound of boot on grass… and a thump. A small figure appeared from the rear of the tree. A boy. Eyes wide, yellow hair drawn back and apple on his left hand. 

**I'm wondering what the point of all this was. If this is part of something larger maybe it would make sense in context. As a standalone piece, or an intro to something, I'm just annoyed at the definitely-Jesus-but-not-actually-Jesus character. Keeping with that theme, I'm wondering what this blond kid is doing in Judea.**"

I myself am a bit guilty thinking that it was short people just being angry about being short.

Sorry if I was guilty of perpetuating that bad image! I just hate watching people beat themselves up for things they can't change, guess kind of against the grain of a society who treats people terribly for things they can't change. Like height for one.

I understand that there's frustration with having something so different about yourself. Without going into detail I know what it's like to be singled out by the community at large and belittle for something, so I can be empathetic towards the bad situations somewhat.

While I agree that people who spend 30k on a mailbox have skewed priorities, I really don't see how fairness factors in to that. It's not necessarily fair that some people are born into better circumstances than others, which leads them to be able to afford dropping 30 large on a mailbox. But this isn't a circumstance that is unique to Athens. Go to any city in the world and you'll see economic disparity, in many instances far more severe than what you see in Athens. 

Since I've been here I've lived in several different areas, some of which brought me into close contact with this inequality we're talking about. I'm not a stranger to it. I just think your criticism is misplaced. Again, without UGA there would literally be no Athens to debate about. While the University does create a disparity, it also created the community in which that disparity exists. If UGA suddenly vanished just imagine the void it would leave in this community. 

Also, anyone who rides a fixie in Athens is a dummy. It's just too hilly for that.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to those like my father who would risk their lives in defense of our country, but I find the way people go far out of their way to thank them is very disingenuous.

If you're willing to invest in Int up to 25, you can eventually buy Crystal Magic Weapon from Big Hat Logan for an extra 252 magic attack rating. Or, with 30 Faith you can use Sunlight Blade and Canvas Talisman for an extra 309 lightning attack rating.

Yes, I know that there are ramifications to your reputation, but the same thing happens to cops. They fucking HATE being pulled off the street and stuck behind a desk. And it goes on their work record. 

So though it may not be *exactly* the same (it's probably not killing their vacation days for processing immediately after an incident), it is pretty darn close.

However, that one little word usually bypasses that because they're being asked in a (slightly) different way. So by saying ""*May* I *interest* you in a tasty beverage?"" the customers brain isn't blocking out the question entirely and going, ""Ooo! A tasty beverage!"" 

So instead of saying, ""Hey *can* I take you out?"" - Find a fun, civil, but different way to ask. "

It's a medical procedure that saves lives and helps people. The problem is we've allowed it to become a negative. So to be pro choice you have to circle speak to say that you're not pro ""baby murder"", but you're pro ""women's reproductive rights"", which is fine.

On ships like [this](http://negroartist.com/Slave%20Ships%20and%20the%20Atlantic%20Crossing%20Middle%20Passage/images/CrossSection%20of%20Slave%20Ship,%201828%201829_jpg.jpg).   I'm sure it wasn't brutal at all in [America](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_QgyAR48MVbM/RnDx2MkvRKI/AAAAAAAAATw/OaPNEnNOPvs/s400/NW0206.jpg).  And I'm sure the Romans walked about like [this](http://www.blackvoicenews.com/ugr/urg_2001/1997/journals/images/day5-t.jpg) too.

As for not executed for public amusement [are you kidding me?](http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=Photos+From+Black+Lynchings&amp;FORM=RESTAB).  There are women and kids in those crowds and it's a jolly day out for all.

Spartacus and his lot got executed and crucified en masse (if that's what you're referring to) because they waged WAR against Rome.  Slaves weren't killed in numbers like that on purpose because even in Rome slaves had (monetary) value.  

Denying that slavery was justified by racism is so insanely silly or that racism was invented by Darwin in the 1860s is amazing.  Don't worry about usernames, *that* arguement tells me far more about your bias than anything else ever could.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390126198.0,"I've used a method similar to the today sponge. I'm allergic to the spermicide found on commercial contraceptive sponges so prior to sex In would use one of my sponge tampons, Soak it in a natural spermicide  and insert that. I Can't give any numerical effectiveness rates because its a 'home remedy' type thing, But the commercial Today sponges are an excellent back up method to the pill if you don't have any allergies. Other good options include cervical caps or diaphragms. However my male partner said the sponge felt very natural inside, and I liked that it cushioned my cervix from any rough sex. I used the sponge for about 8 months along with fertility tracking and withdrawal. (not the smartest move, but it worked in my favour, and at the time I was told I couldn't have any hormones and there was a 12 month wait on my copper IUD *and* I had just started very effective medication for my vulvodynia and my sex drive came back after stopping the pill.)

The sponge is rated for stand-alone contraception, so since you will be using it alongside the pill, you pretty much achieve Implant level contraception.

Its definitely worth a try as sponges are cheap(ish) and don't need professional fitting, I recommend buying at least two so you can open one up and rub it behind your knee or in the nook of your elbow 24 hours prior to sex, to make sure you don't get any skin irritation. If all is good, open up that second one and have fun. They might come in bulk packs where you live so telling you to buy two might be redundant, I'm in rural Australia so they are hard to find."

Walmart gets the benefit of not having to pay their employees more, obviously can't keep an employee if they are too hungry to come to work, while we the taxpayers split the burden. Plus when was the last time you saw some 16 year old kid working at Walmart? They don't want the kind of entry level employees you're talking about cause they still have ""hope,"" nobody wants to work at Walmart but they do out of desperation due to a system where the wealth is so unevenly distributed that the Walton family owns more accumulated wealth than the bottom 40% of Americans combined. Plus you mention living on $3 an hour and being fine... clearly you don't understand the principle of inflation, the current minimum wage has not kept up with inflation and your average American (note: Middle Class) today is making less money than they were 30-40 years ago while the top echelons of society have seen vast appreciation of their wealth, you can't look at that and say nothing is wrong."
FountainsOfFluids,changemyview,1390126566.0,"For one thing, you ignored the rest of my post about being in a union.

For a second thing, the events we are complaining about is when cops are accused of abusing their roles. Such as when an innocent person dies. It is theoretically possible that the cop did everything right, but to everybody it looks bad. That's when they get administrative leave. Because it is possible it was properly in the line of duty.

If a cop gets caught robbing a bank, they don't get administrative duty. They get arrested and thrown in jail like anybody else.

See, your job probably doesn't involve walking around in public with a gun and instructions to intervene in extreme situations. Therefor you don't get a lot of leeway in those heated moments. But the cop is *supposed to be there doing something*. So it's a little absurd to handcuff a cop and haul him off to jail just because he fired his weapon. The act of firing his weapon is part of his job. 

And finally, if it is determined that the cop had no business pulling their gun and firing (or whatever), then yes, they get arrested, jailed, processed, and put on trial just like you."

We aren't being cued up and prompted so it feels more real.  Also we don't know to prepare ourselves for the scare like we do when music tells us to.

*  Supernatural horror.  Sure you might jump at Freddy and Jason in the Cinema and Paranormal experience might widen a few eyes when watching it.  I'm sure Ringu made people jump too.

*  They rely on the characters to do stupid things that we feel we wouldn't do and so we don't empathise with.  We don't really care what happens to the pretty blond girl who goes to investigate disembodied voices from the basement because we feel whatever happens is her stupid fault.  Heck, we even feel satisfied when the ghost thingy chews her up.  That's gratification, not fear.

ixAp0c,skateboarding,1390127215.0,"Some people don't start until their 21 and get sponsored.  But for me it isn't about being sponsored, it's just about having a good time, if you skate and are good and have style, sponsorship will come if you get noticed...  But it's really not about money.  

It really depends on how much you put into it, and how hungry you are to get better.

You'll either go out and skate to practice everyday you can and it's nice enough, or you won't really progress much if you just try once a month.

Being comfortable on the board from using it as transport a lot will help you to learn tricks, riding is half of doing every trick.  You have to be able to maneuver over the stuff your skating. 

I'm 21 and going on 22 this year, just got into skating again last year taking it seriously.  

Age really doesn't matter, just stretch a little before you skate to prevent being overly sore, if you stretch for a few minutes before you session it's also a good time to zone into yourself and zone out from the world, going into deep breathing and deep thought...  Once your done stretching you should be good.

I just take a good amount of water with me when I session.

You say you've never gotten past a stationary ollie, but can you do a stationary ollie on pavement?

If you can already ollie stationary you should be able to start doing really slow moving ollies, and increase the speed a little as you get more comfortable doing them.  Before you know it you'll be hauling ass doing ollies and maybe moving into the next tricks to learn...

Check out /r/newskaters, and Braille Skateboarding is a good YouTube channel to check out with a ton of tutorials on how to do pretty much everything from riding, rolling off curbs, to ollies, 180s, flip tricks, fakie tricks, nollie tricks, how to trick over certain obstacles like curbs or stairs, etc."

4) Simply wrong. MK8 and SSB have been confirmed as spring releases. While we don't have solid dates for the others it's very likely we'll see them this year.
5) I'm basing this on experience. Unlike other publishers they keep things close to their chests. The only time they've had long periods between announcement and release is when they make an announcement and then the game is delayed. Skyward sword is one game that springs to mind, I think that was delayed by 6-12 months at least.

Look at MK8, it was presented at E3 and it looked practically ready to go, in fact it was a playable demo. This was less than a year before launch.

Compare that to Ubisofts Watch Dogs. That was unveiled at the previous E3 and will be coming out at the same time as MK8"

As for the refs, I've seen them blow the whistle when they lose sight of the puck for a tenth of a second, they didn't blow it off for 2 seconds here and couldn't deduce that a puck physically cannot deflect from Quick at that speed or angle without hitting the mesh. Those refs deserve to be publicly shamed and never ref in any capacity ever again.

Edit: And it's not a goal in the letter of the law. The laws of hockey clearly state that play is stopped when the puck hits the netting at the ends, and that clearly happened."

justgivingsomeadvice,Foodforthought,1390127851.0,"That's not an argument because it assumes every major has equal *value* to society, which isn't the case. You're right that if everyone went to STEM, engineers' salaries would probably fall (I'm not a labor economist either though). But this logic fails because you're making the false equivalence that this scenario is the same to the current situation where certain majors (e.g. fashion or art history or something) struggle to find employment.

In fact, I don't know about all engineering, but I know there's a shortage of programmers in America so encouraging people to do STEM (even if it adds competition) is a good thing.

Personally, my logic is that if you're truly passionate (and adequately talented) at something, stick with it. But if you're only an art history major because you kind of like it, or you're a music major because you like violin (but not enough to practice/have practiced 3-4 hours a day) then yeah there's a problem. If you're going to be mediocre you might as well pick something that's needed in society somewhere that you can do competently well. And hopefully one day as a society we get to a place where people can do whatever they like to do without having to worry about contributing to society (but I'd bet that's beyond my lifetime) "

Tonight even a guy came in and only worked 3 hours, but he made $85 in cash, granted it'd been snowing all day and it was mostly pity tips and we were slammed... but that's equal to around $28 an hour. 

Our drivers average about $80-$150 (Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays is pretty much the only time the $100 mark is broken) for a 6-8 hour shift. Not to mention they get another 4.50 an hour on top of that. It is honestly insane how much money a driver can make.

Lost_Afropick,AskReddit,1390128057.0,"&gt; Ameriocentirism is viewing things through the American lens

we're discussing slavery *in* America.  I'm actually Southern African and I know very well how Racism was around long before the 1860s.  It's wrapped up in every fabric of my regional history.

The term race as a word being dated to a specific time doesn't mean the concept was unknown or acted upon.  This is beyond obvious.  Did not Queen Elizabeth I complain of too many blacks in England in her time.  Are you claiming people were blind before Darwin?  That before taxonomy was being used to classify and order race people themselves did not discriminate and act on race?  The very existence of African slavery in the Americas is a giant argument against that by itself.  Why source one type of peoples exclusively as slaves?  Sure Chinese and Irish indentured servants were around for limited periods but they were not the prime product.  Why exclusively black African when Africa was so very far to get to if not acting upon known concepts of racial superiority.  The wording and scientific classification means nothing if racism already existed in practice.  Why continue to wipe out the Native Americans in the North and South continents of the Americas if racial superiority didn't exist?

The wording and classification used before Darwin for the widely held and practised belifed the good old curse of Ham. They knew race.  They dressed it up in other language.  

When talking about trans-atlantic slavery it's easy to divorce it from the beginnings to colonisation, apartheid, jim crow.  To divorce the north American trade from the South American one and see all these things as separate events that just happened.  Mere blips on the continuum of human history.  But looking at them as a complete package (which it was) shows the actual picture.  To make use of slavery in Africa and the fact that raids happened in Africa as a way of diverting attention from the causes of those raids is extremely beguiling.  Most of the African nations (I refuse to say tribe given modern useage of the term) saw themselves as independent nations going to war and rivalling as they always had, with their neighbours.  They could ally with Germans and English and Portugese against their old enemies.  The Germans, English and Portuguese however saw all the Africans as Africans.  They're all blacks.  All colonized.  Alliances made with this or that king meant squat in European laws and society.  Demonstrating clearly the realism of actual racism before arguements and classifications of definitions in the 1860s.  

As for years of education vs popular media, you know nothing of me.  And I of you.  We can all claim to be doctors but note we're on an anonymous website and use your words to make your case not claims of deeps wells of knowledge I've seen no evidence of.   People always sound pompous and silly when stating things like this on message boards.  It's best not to.  Mate. 

Oh yes, and falsely accusing me of appeals to emotion is the worst kind of smug superiority right there on display.  Doesn't even begin to ring true.

Your whole argument is that trans-Atlantic slavery was nothing special, was not particularly directed at Africans since nobody believed in the idea of race, nobody was the target and nobody was particularly to blame.  Just another day.  Nothing different in treatment in ideology or justification, no different in scale and numbers.  This tells me far more than any accusations you make about my bias"

I try to go far out of my way to show that I care for someone, as I am not so good with words. Like cooking, something many men mentioned in this thread. I am a very busy person so taking a large chunk of my time and spending it on providing care for someone is a sincere expression of love for me.  I cook well, and I don't mind doing the bulk of cooking for someone I love. But I hate it, and cooking becomes a burden, when my expression of love is taken for granted and treated as a behavior that is just expected of me. Then I stop cooking.

You have to remember, unfortunately, that although this is a huge deal, it will eventually be a drop in the bucket. I know it sucks to think about it that way.

Keep going, man. Don't settle for second best. Take this time to improve yourself, your health, your schoolwork, and your social life. It'll feel satisfying to direct your pent-up emotion over this toward working out, studying, etc, and you'll be a better person in the end.

Try to process more than distract: when you get pangs of missing him, explore that emotion. Figure out what it is, feel it in your body, go try to 'touch' that sadness or longing. It sucks to process, I know, but it'll keep you from hurting yourself in the future by leaving it unresolved.

I'm completely serious about this: PM me. Keep in touch. I want to know how you're doing, and I want to hear the stories that you're grieving the loss of. If I can help by listening or advising, let me know.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390128256.0,"&gt; Either way, if it wasn't for height, there would be some other trait people would use as a determinant of social/sexual value. That's where the whole dating thing breaks down. There was one comment on reddit that really stuck with. There was a swedish guy who basically dismissed heighism and said that all the traditional ways that men were evaluated as suitors had been broken down by political correctness and that there was almost nothing left but height so why not? Crass to be sure, but he had a point. Men used to be judged heavily by race, religion, who their family was, what your job was (this pretty much used to be the #1 important thing about a guy - and while it's still important, it's less so than it used to be.) and a host of all kinds of other things that were held in more importance than height. I'm not saying that it was better back then, but there is always going to be something. 

I think that this is pretty much true.  As those other ""markers of relationship value"" fade away as taboo, height becomes more and more important.  I bet that height was way down the list of factors as recent as the turn of the 20th century, but now it's the #1 or #2 factor for most women.  But, I also think that height has become more culturally important at the same time.  And I think it will continue to get worse and worse as time goes on, unless we stand against this and make heightism as taboo as some of these other myths which are broadly (and rightly) stigmatized.

I don't want to talk down about this community, I'm really glad it's here precisely because it's an outlet for posts like this, among other things. One of the inherent problems with it, though, is that we're all so used to this kind of thing (for me it's memory problems that really get me down...I used to have amazing recall) that the inevitable response is like, ""yeah, I know, right? It really sucks."" I think the majority of subscribers often don't respond to self-posts because what else is there to say? I'm not saying it's not valuable to have an empathetic support system. But sometimes it's still not enough. We're all in on it, sure, but such a huge part of the public still fears or doesn't understand epilepsy, so it's hard to justify our limitations without coming off as a freak, or being weak, or any number of unsavory descriptors. We WANT those people to understand; it's validating somehow. I don't know, that's how I feel. And then if you ""come out"" as epileptic people look at you like you are either a dormant volano or like you are bragging in a way, playing a card that makes you special.

Population of California: 38.04million

Population of Great Britain: 57.1million

Number of Nobel prizes attributed to CA universities: 177

Number of Nobel prizes attributed to GB: 120

Numbers don't lie. 

Just like in the EU, the US has a good amount of states (but in your case would be countries) that don't contribute to much academically, so counting them when comparing GB to the US when just in terms of Nobel awards by population is ridiculous. 

Pound for pound, both GB and GR lose to a SINGLE state in the United States. We could bring more into this, but there's really no need to.

Sahasrahla,fantasywriters,1390130108.0,"Thanks for sharing, I liked this. Not much happens, but that doesn't mean it can't draw readers into the story. (God knows nothing ever happens in *The Name of the Wind*, but it's still a best seller and something I enjoyed reading.) Action can be one way to hook a reader but it's not the only way. Here you seem to be going more for atmosphere (otherwise, why have the very first line be about the dark night and cold wind?) and a bit of mystery as the hook (who is this stranger of few words?). Personally, I like that kind of thing more than, say, two characters I know nothing about having a sword fight. 

However, for what you're trying to do I felt like you said a bit too much. You want to draw the reader in quickly. Unlike in the middle of your story, you don't have the luxury of a captive audience to spend time on extraneous details. Figure out what you want to accomplish with this scene and do it fast. Saying more with less gives your writing an extra little something. Some key elements it looks like you're trying to include:

* The quiet man has come to the inn. There are few people there and it's a bit odd that he showed up when he did. 
* The quiet man is, well, quiet. He makes the innkeeper uncomfortable. 
* The quiet man is staying for an indeterminate amount of time. He's not used to being inside, or at least anywhere nice. What's he planning? the reader wonders.
* The quiet man is perhaps in some kind of danger. The plot, I assume. This tantalises the reader and makes them want to know what happens. 

Since the premier piece of writing advice is ""show, don't tell"", I thought I'd write a short intro based on these points to show you what I'm talking about. I hope I'm not stepping on your toes here! I'm not saying that what you write should be like what I write, but I thought it would get my point across better than whatever else I could say. In any case, I hope you find some use in this and good luck with your writing. Keep at it! 

--- 

Night. Full moon. A cruel, cold wind blows from the north. An inn: glowing windows, warm hearth, hot meal. People; danger. Raised hand. Hesitation. The Cloaked Man knocks. 

A pause. 

Scraping chair. Still time to run. Muffled call from inside. The door opens. 

""Hello! Welcome! Come in, come in, I can't believe you're out on a night like this."" Innkeeper. Portly, bald. Red nosed, smiling. Honest face. Trustworthy? 

No choice. Step inside. 

""I didn't expect to have a guest so late. Not that I mind, of course. Your coin will spend like anyone else's, what I always say.""

Death hung on the walls. Elk, deer, bear. Their heads. Trophies. Where are the hunters? 

""Place is near empty as you can see. Just me and the wife. Not many folks travelling the roads this time of year. You'll be needing a room, yeah? Three silver a night and you can have breakfast and supper with me and the missus. If you're just needing a meal - not that I'd suggest heading out again tonight, mind - it's a copper for broth and bread.""

The Cloaked Man spoke. ""The room.""

""And how many nights will you be staying?""

Silence. The inkeeper swallows. Fidgets. No eye contact. Timid. Nervous. 

Good. 

Count out three silver. Shown to a room. Creaking boards in the hallway; the honest man hurries away. 

Safety, now. How long? 

Outside, the moon reaches its zenith.

I know this because my druid used to wipe out pretty quickly when I was trying desperately to make my heals more worthwhile with intellect (to get spell power), but what I realized I needed more was stamina.

Not the stat stamina.

But of course there's a balance, in everything. I don't think it's effective to write a post that's longer than the average high-school English paper. Neither is it effective to go in with the a bullet-point list of every little detail you want, and expect that you'll get everything on your list. Sex isn't always perfect; the interactions we find on DPP won't be either. 

On the other hand, it seems a bit silly to not be clear about what you're looking for. I know what I want, so I might as well be up-front about it, and get to the good stuff that much faster."

However, it was exactly what I needed at the time.  Since then my father is a good friend, but he had the most impact on my life in the time when I was a teenager.  That time has past and that is the time he wanted to spend on me.  Since then we're just enjoying each other.  But if I were a father, I'd spend it being one of a rebellious 17 year old, and helping him become a man.

I, too, don't have grandchildren for my mother or father.  I wish I did for them.  I just haven't and neither has my brother.

My father is in his 70's now, and I don't know what I'll do when he leaves us, but he had his greatest impact on my life when I was the most resistant to him.

I'm hoping that you are your father's son, and that is more meaningful a legacy that he has left us than any loss you experience."

Why was he in a half squat?  He was trying to jerk off into a large McDonald's cup.  I silently went back to the guest room and seriously wondered if I had just dreamt that whole thing.

Escape92,GirlGamers,1390130734.0,"I've heard this view a lot before, and I imagine it can hold a lot of weight if you don't have experience of struggling with gender identity or sexuality. In most places, the attention you (fear you may) get for breaking the rules on the correct way to perform your gender is negative. Teenage girls especially seem to be afraid to come out as bisexual because it is feared they will be perceived as attention seeking - because female bisexuality has been sexualised for men in such a way that it has been delegitimised.

I just don't think you really understand the fear involved with the coming out process, especially for teenagers. Nobody likes negative attention, especially not teenagers who mostly just want to fit in with their peers, and so people only tend to come out if they don't feel they will get attention for it. It's only not scary if you know nobody is going to care.

Tl;dr: kids don't usually form their identities around a desire to be ostracised from their families and beaten by their peers."

Sketches_Stuff_Maybe,teenagers,1390130786.0,"I'm not sure what you're looking for. If you're after a place to vent, to just release frustration or anger or sorrow, feel free to PM me. If you're after *why*, the truth is, you'll likely never get that why. And that leads to what I think you're after: Closure.

You won't get closure from her. Having her 'go away' does nothing. As someone who had three months of 'go away' and now has to see their ex every day and work with them, it's something that doesn't 'go away'. But closure isn't going to come from them; it's going to come from you.

Think about it for a second. If you could just go up to them and say *anything* to them, and they have to listen, what would you say? I miss you? I loved you and you left me? I don't even *like* you anymore, so why do I keep thinking about you? Notice that all those questions are I, I, I. The closure comes from within, and realizing two major things: 1) You, on some level, liked or maybe even loved her. You saw something in her that you connected with and were attracted to, or you wouldn't have been in that relationship at all. That like/love is never going to go away. It may dull over time, but it'll always be there; embrace it, because it's a part of you. 2) She wasn't right for you. She may be a great person and beautiful and funny and smart, but she isn't the person for you, and on some level, either you or she realized this.

That's important shit right there. It doesn't detract from you or her, but it just says that you're willing to accept it didn't work out. That doesn't mean it can't, later, if you grow as a person and she does too and both of you want to give it a shot, but it means that right now, it just won't happen. Until you accept this, nothing can happen or change. It may take time; some people embrace it, some people resent it, some people just allow for it. But literally nothing will hurt more than seeing that person and thinking ""I could be there right now"" because it is lying to yourself and that memory you have of them.

Now, you have an obligation, not only to yourself, but to them as well, to let yourself be happy. The very fact that you're sad means that you miss something good/happy, and it means you had fun, but you can't have your cake and eat it too. Go explore the world, explore yourself; force yourself to make a new friend, go talk to other people, something, anything. Don't mope around or think about it too much. It can be as simple as hang out with friends or read a new book, or as complex as bungee jumping or skydiving. And while your heart may not be in it at first, it'll help over time :)"

GeoffreyArnold,tall,1390131682.0,"Thanks for the knee-jerk downvote.  But have you actually read the Case and Paxson paper?  I have.  The idea is that smarter people are encouraged to go into higher paying, more competitive fields and that less intelligent people are encouraged to go into lower paying, less competitive fields.  And that explains the pay gap in terms of height.  They completely side-step the obvious question of whether intelligence also explains the gender pay gap, because males are generally taller than females.  And they never account for the numerous studies which show actual employer height discrimination.  They completely ignore that data in order to support their thesis.  

Also the correlation is incredibly weak and they never show that slightly smarter people are more likely to earn more than slightly dumber people if height were factored out.  I suspect that if this study were done, they would find almost no correlation and that height has a bigger impact on income than intelligence.  "

I'll say that this subreddit is supposed to be ""A place for people of small stature to discuss the pros, cons, highs and very lows of being smaller than average"".  So, you're going to get different types of posts.  And, a person who is in a happy relationship at the moment is less likely to post about dating than someone who is not.  So, the results will naturally look skewed.  Combine that with the real statistical truth that most women discriminate against short men in the dating market, and you get some of the comments which you read on the front page of /r/short.

Edit: Also, why the focus on ""insecurity""?  This seems like a form of blame shifting.  Why not focus on the fact that there actually is a huge bias against short men in the dating market?  It's not an imagined product of a person's ""insecurity"" - it's real and exists whether or not you're confident.  Now, maybe it can be overcome and maybe you have some advice for some of the guys here.  But starting a post by blaming short men for ""insecurity"" creates a bad first impression.

anonlymouse,martialarts,1390132389.0,"Freestyle Wrestling: 

*No riding time, leading to a Judo-like ground game that results in way too many stand ups with no effort to escape back to standing. 

*No double collar ties, for some reason you're only allowed one hand on the head, which I imagine is probably to ban full nelsons and variants, but it's a pretty important skill to deal with. 

*No submissions, which is a bit disappointing as it developed out of Catch, but it can also be a plus in fighting through sloppy submission attempts.

*No wall/fence work. It's incredibly useful working as a bouncer, and the skill set is right there in wrestling, but it's never trained outside MMA.

Submission Wrestling:

*No pinning. Obviously a pin doesn't end a fight, but having both your shoulder blades on the mat is pretty terrible unless you're in the process of applying a finish. It could definitely do with having both shoulder blades on the mat for 3 seconds count as a pin fall. 

*Having to compete in BJJ tournaments (more of a recent problem) with their pansy knee reaping rules. 

*No slams, leads to some bad habits for when slams are actually allowed. Judo has it right with Daki Age. 

MMA:

*Separation of striking and grappling. In a good school this won't be the case, but you'll see a lot of absurdities like starting with standup striking and when the fight hits the ground everyone pauses and takes their gloves off, and then continues without strikes. 

*Related to that, no good wrestling. Usually grappling is covered as ground work and submissions, and not much on position, and striking is lucky if it looks like Muay Thai, and having it look like San Shou is even more rare. "

megamouth2,explainlikeIAmA,1390132608.0,"Your honour, where on earth do I start? This note is clearly nowhere near being an admission of guilt. In fact, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'd say that it is more of a disclaimer and letter of innocence.

Let's begin with ""Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality. Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see."" We can clearly see that the defendant, Mr Nicholas Rage, is clearly in a state of mental distress. He doesn't know his left from his right, and what's real from what's not. Clearly, your honour, a man with this demeanour cannot commit such a heinous crime. As he states in the note, he is just a poor boy. He is not your well-thought-out madman with a penchant for penitentiary punishment, he's simply a normal man, like any one of us, who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

And he's innocent, ladies and gentlemen of the jury. This boy doesn't even want to make his mother cry - there there Mrs. Rage \*hands her a tissue as she sobs quietly in the corner*. He doesn't want to cause any inconvenience to the poor lady, and despite knowing that her life revolves around him, he urges her to carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters. Would a boy so troubled and considerate wish to tarnish his innocent name? I think not.

You may say, your honour, it's too late, his time has come. But your honour, what you fail to recognise is that as well as not being of sound mind, he is not *physically* able to commit the crimes you accuse him of - his body's aching all the time. You may say that he's got to leave you all behind and face the truth... but he's not going anywhere, and we're hearing the truth right here and right now, in this very courtroom. My client does not want to die - and luckily enough, we're in a state where they do not advocate the use of the death penalty [you're welcome, Mr Rage - you'll find further details on my bill after the trial]. But with the stress of this trial and of these preposterous allegations, my client feels as though he sometimes wishes he'd never been born at all - clear symptoms of depression, your honour; depression that was present at the time of the alleged incident that has been unduly exacerbated by this trial.

The defendant is just a poor boy, nobody loves him. He's just a poor boy from a poor family, sparing his life from this monstrosity. Not only more evidence that he is not of sound mind, but also proof that he did not have the money to afford the gun that you state he committed the murder with. 

Not only is my client appealing to the hearts and minds of you, the human population, in this note, but he's craving divine intervention. ""Bismillah!"" he writes, over and over again. No man who isn't innocent would attempt to seek the assistance of God... right? Right...?

But finally, we see the real reason for this alleged crime - which, by the way, I still highly doubt my client committed. This was a crime of passion - and even then, it was in self defence. The alleged victim has been known to law enforcement before, as he has stoned my client and even spat in his eye. If there is *anyone* in this case who is remorseless, it is the victim, who originally loved my client, and ruthlessly left him to die. As Mr Rage points out in his note, this was really the only way for him to get right out of here.

I think that shows, your honour, and ladies and gents of the jury, that my client is 100% innocent. All he is is a vulnerable child with a history of mental health issues, who is unable to afford the necessary instruments for such a crime, and would only resort to such an act in self-defence. I rest my case.

&gt;The film leaves us hoping that the fantasy is real, which is analogous to hoping that such a better world can be realized in our world, despite Fascistic forces that are trying to bring most of humanity under their subjugation.


Thank you, this is an excellent summary. 

The argument keeps getting made that that certain events or their order somehow suggests the fantasy is ""real"", but this disregards the nature of fantasy as well as the perspective of the fantasy we are seeing.

Just because we see the fantastic version of events that lead Ofiloia to the captain's room, that does not mean it's the only version of events. To put it another way, if you consider the fantasy as a whole to have been constructed retroactively, there are really no issues here; *of course* it would align with or appear to preempt reality. "

Countless times studio's have ruined a film that could have been much better. Creative works are tampered with by studio's and we get a different version. Take Batman: Year One, the Darren Aronofsky version that was never completed. When the studio came up with concept art, they completely changed Aronofsky's vision of the film. Similarly, they change films to be more child friendly.

More often than not, I would like films to be left with the people who know best, especially when it is a beloved franchise. Directors are more often than not willing to work alongside graphic novel authors, novel authors and such (if they can) to bring the best possible version of their vision to fans. Yet, studios meddle or fans get pissed because someone they don't know is working on the series.

GeoffreyArnold,tall,1390133304.0,"&gt; That's because there was no correlation there to begin with, they measured height differences between populations of the same gender. 

Right.  They didn't bother to look at intelligence on a cross-gender basis.  They wanted to isolate height without looking at gender. 

&gt;It was already established women and men have similar levels of intelligence on average.

And this study established that tall people and short people have similar levels of intelligence on average.  The small statistical difference is about the same that you'd find in modern studies looking at IQ results from males and females.  Do you think this explains the gender pay gap?

&gt;Numerous studies? The very study you linked says there's barely any data for it.

No.  It said that many studies didn't directly look at it.  

&gt;The correlation is statistically significant, which is enough for it to have an impact in the real world. You often only lose out on jobs or promotions because of a slight edge. 

It's the same statically significant difference between male and female IQ.

""Several meta-studies between 1994 and 2005 found mean IQ of men exceeding that of women by a range of 3–5 points"" -wikipedia

Maybe the gender pay gap is because men are statistically a bit smarter than women because they tend to be taller.  Would you agree with such a conclusion?

I've never had the slightest desire to rape anyone. I've never had a male friend tell me he wanted to rape anyone, either. Yet several women have told me they've had fantasies of being raped. Therefore, I could only interpret the idea that I'm a natural-born rapist as the rank projection of some homely girl's deep-seated fantasies.

Brightt,Guildwars2,1390134060.0,"Except, most of the dungeon community ([DnT], [LOD], [rT], [HC], [IX]) don't even bother with taking PUGs, because it's not going to work out for either portion of the party. If we can't fill a team, we'll usually just 3 or 4 man, while waiting for a 5th. 

Many of us even partook in 'charity runs' in Arah where they would carry players that couldn't finish the dungeon and give tips etc. Add to that that some of us also put out guide after guide (Obal, Brazil, Nike, spoj for example), pretty much shows that we're not evil people a lot of you make us out to be.

But, whenever we put forth our opinions or our knowledge on anything, we're always met with negativity and hostility. We're called scum, exploiters, elitists, assholes,... People always tell us we're the toxic ones, but the only reason we turned toxic is because of the non-stop hostility we have to endure both here and on the official forums. Many of us have been permanently banned there because our opinions apparently don't match the ones of the casual crowd. We've been specifically targeted for no reason at all. Wethospu got a flood control filter *without getting an infraction*. He just randomly logged onto his account one day and had flood control.

And people wonder why we hate the casual crowd so much."

thekingsdaughter,WritingPrompts,1390134737.0,"This prompt kind of bothers me.  It makes me feel like you do not believe in Jesus or God. I understand your bitterness towards the Westboro Baptist Church. I’m used to that by now though I wish the reality was different.  Regardless of the ignorance of the WBBC and the pain they have caused, their actions should not corrupt your belief in Jesus.  I admit I used to be more religious but now I see things more clear, more spiritually.  God is an abstract.  And anyway, my Grandfather, Grandpa Fred to me and Fred Phelps to you, once invited Jesus into our home and didn’t even know it. It was ten years ago, I was seventeen and had my first boyfriend. We were home-schooled, so meeting people was harder then than now, since now I’m not living with my family anymore.
My boyfriend worked in the deli of the supermarket near our home.  Sometimes when my mother was too busy, she would send me to pick up groceries in the afternoon.  That was when Isaac had a lunch break. He was always standing outside of the supermarket, smoking a cigarette near the back door and he always smelled like oil and deli meat.  I loved the smell.  I think he was sixteen. He had straight blonde hair and brown eyes. His lips were really pink and he reminded me of someone but I could never place it. I kept seeing something in his young, tanned face and sparkling eyes but I didn’t remember what it was.  It was a very innocent romance as far as teenagers go.  I was raised to exhibit exuberant modesty so the first month of our little secret romance outside the Safeway all we did was hold hands.  
One whole week in April of that year, my mother was very busy because my grandpa had invited another pastor to the church.  Pastor Jim from Gardena Valley Baptist Church in Los Angeles.  Grandpa Fred wanted Pastor Jim to be happy and comfortable with us.  He wanted our faith to be palpable.  My mother took this to mean lots of homecooked meals and so I was sent to the grocery store almost everyday in our preparation for his arrival.  The day before Pastor Jim’s plane landed, my mother sent me to buy sandwiches for lunch.  I went to the store and Isaac was out back as usual.  When I greeted him, Good Afternoon, he took me in his arms and leaned in towards my face.  I could feel how much stronger he was and I didn’t like it.  I was really nervous but he smiled, closed his eyes, and his lips met mine.  I closed my eyes too, because I thought I was supposed to and then Sharon Stone’s face popped into my brain.  Isaac’s tongue reached into my mouth and I wanted it to be Sharon Stone’s.  
I remember groaning into his mouth and trying to get free. He was cautious of his boss finding him, kissing some poorly dressed bare-faced Baptist girl, and instantly let go. I said Bye and left.
I walked home with no sandwiches.  I felt so much guilt. I was squirming and uncomfortable. I went to find my mother and tell her I couldn’t get the lunch but she was busy trying to calm down Grandpa Fred who was arguing with some guy that was in the chapel trying to fix the pulpit.  Grandpa Fred had hired him over the phone but when he arrived and turned out to be an African-American, he wanted a different handyman to come.  I think his name was Jason or John.  Grandpa Fred was also mad because Jason told him that he, Grandpa Fred, was responsible for breaking the pulpit. 
The pulpit in a chapel is the lectern you speak at. Ours was a really beautiful piece someone made for our church.  Grandpa Fred wanted to put a shelf under it to hold paperwork and to do so he took off a back panel, without which the pulpit had begun to warp under awkward weight distribution.  Jason told Grandpa Fred that the pulpit had been made in a certain way by whichever carpenter made it and had intended for it to be the way it was originally made and that he should not be messing with it’s foundation if he didn’t truly understand what it would do to the pulpit.  Grandpa Fred didn’t understand and furiously sent Jason away. 
I went to my room and sat on my bed for a long time thinking about Sharon Stone.  I realized God would never have allowed those images to enter my mind if it had not been his intention.  From there a lot of my loyalty to the church and my family dissolved.  I didn’t talk to my family about it much and kept quiet. I asked to go to college in Louisville and now I live in Austin, with my girlfriend. My family just thinks she’s my roommate. They wouldn’t understand anyway so I don’t talk about it with them.

Girls, didn't ever know I was suppose to have a problem. Had the usual junior high make out games as everyone else. Had the usual progressions that most guys have in high school and lost my virginity at 16. 

I am a true believer that when it comes to height, that woman that have never met you in person, say on dating sites, will have a stereotype that she has seen in the media that fixates in her mind. That is why I think it is important for short men to meet face to face with any prospective date. Out side of complete heightist or women a lot taller than yourself, If you are a good and decent human being that takes care of yourself, in most cases your height won't make a difference.

And one last thing. Being a good and decent person in dating also means that you don't turn away someone that doesn't fit a perfect media driven version of a woman in terms of looks and body. It's about matching personalities as much as anything else.

By the way, good positive post. Thanks for sharing.

MrJewbagel,AskReddit,1390135408.0,"First off: there are plenty of other countries where guns are accessible by the masses. It's mind-boggling that people think it's only the US when in every single one of these threads people from other pro-gun countries chime in and tell their stories.

Secondly: You think it's loony because that's the way you were raised. It's part of who you are... your culture. Here in the US, and other countries, it is part of OUR culture to have guns. 99% of the time people like to own guns for recreation. It's fun to go out and target shoot. Since it's fun, we pass it from generation to generation for it bonds us together. 

For those of us who have guns to protect ourselves, I don't even know how this is viewed as loony. Why would anyone in their right minds believe waiting for help to arrive is the most viable option for every situation? Being able to protect yourself is a basic right to all humans and having a proper tool to do so is only common sense.
What makes people believe that guns are a bigger problem than they are is how data is recorded. (NOTE: This is for ""normal"" situations, not involving gang violence in places like Chicago that greatly skews results.) The way data is recorded here, we only count the number of deaths. We don't count if it's self defense. People probably know this but they look at the numbers and still think it's all innocent people dying. Another statistic that would help even out everything would be the amount of crimes prevented by guns. When no one is shot though, meaning only showing a gun prevented the crime, no data is recorded. You have to dig through all the local newspapers nationwide to find these stories, but there are plenty of them.

Another point about self defense, and I know everyone who's anti-gun hates this argument, is the fact that we CAN'T get rid of all the guns. If the government called for all of us to turn in our guns, you know what would happen? All of us law abiding citizens, who happen to be gun owners, would turn in our guns (not speaking for the radicals here obviously.) Now, since all of the law abiding people are unarmed, who has the power? The government and the criminals. I, personally, really don't like the idea of either of them being able to force themselves upon me.

i have been alone since i was 18, i'm 25 now. i have not been in a relationship, but i have fixed my family's station in life from this job, i got my father of the streets and bought him a car (despite the fact that i myself have never owned one) my sister is in college and rents a house with 4 other girls. my mother, as always is tough as nails and has sacrificed more than i can bear to mention. 

being alone has taught me how to endure the worst pain of all, the boredom of daily life. that slow pain that never ceases when all is said and done, when you have your thoughts to yourself just before you lose yourself in the shadow of sleep. 

everything i do is to forget the painful truth that most of my life will be spent working and fighting ennui, so anything to relieve this; whether its a good story in whichever medium it may be or the company of someone i can enjoy even for a small amount of time, is good enough to get me by.

i have slept with women, but as time goes on, i know less and less about what it is to love someone. i hope if i do, that i wont have to just cope with or endure loneliness, but not even consider it a factor anymore in my life. 

    

* tl;dr: coping with loneliness is about fighting boredom.

you fight boredom by doing things with your life and enjoying doing those things, and people you do it with. "

I can sleep next to my boyfriend who snores, who I see maybe once every week or two (not often enough to get used to it, I mean), by using ear plugs and taking some antihistamines (any sleeping pill will do) to help me drift off. The sleeping pills help to get her to sleep, at which point the earplugs will help to *keep* her asleep because it dulls the noise. 

Some white noise is also super helpful. If she has an air conditioner, have her turn it on fan - those make quite a bit of noise. A radio, or fan, or something else would also be sufficient.

It's not always about the purpose of the war, if you want to talk about that, look at the top, not the bottom. A lot of people who go into the military are impressionable men and women, who have little real world experience, and geniunely think they are doing the right thing due to what they were taught at home/school or elsewhere.

And they volunteer to give up 4+ years of their life, not knowing what they're getting into, and come out of it much worse for wear and used up because the military has no problem using them and treating them as expendable when they are told that they will have the support and backing that they need, even when they get out. Which they don't.

Some people go because the military has open billiets and if you can't afford school and can't find a job, the military may be the best solution for them. They're still filling a billet and putting up with the military's shit, they deserve a little slack and I don't know about you personally, but I see a lot of people in a position where they are essentially upper middle class white college kids who have had the good fortune of having a different path available to them, and then ask why we should thank the soliders for something they would never be willing to do themselves, and have never had the need to because they are better off and completely assume everyone else is like them."

We must not abandon the small group of men who are suffering but that just means we need to work harder and change the culture.

betona,news,1390135987.0,"Former FBO owner here, and the article is too light on facts to tell much.  What I don't understand is that the EPA came out with a ton of regulations for underground storage tanks I'm thinking in the late '80s where all existing tanks had to be tested and have monitoring installed.  I had a facility with twelve 20,000 gallon tanks and we had to test 'em, install an electronic monitoring system that could tell very small leaks and also drilled core samples all around and in between the facility looking for leaks. And it was an ongoing program-not a one-time deal.  A lot of companies at that time just dug up their old tanks and either put in new double-wall tanks with monitors in between the walls, or else above-ground with large containment boxes (tank inside a tank) = problem solved.

And wouldn't you know it, we found one was leaking jet fuel, so we had to dig it up and started on a remediation plan.  At first we had to dig up dirt and send it to a facility ($$), but later we discovered a microbial product with bugs ""eat"" petroleum called micro-blaze and darned if it didn't do an awesome job - within about a year and a half, petroleum levels were much lower than background noise levels. So how does 20,000 leak when everybody had to have systems that could tell is 2 or 3 gallons leaked?  Or is the military exempt from EPA regs?"

Later, I started using [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlzQqToPchM) song, for the opposite reason: it's quiet and lullaby-like, while still covering up a lot of bassy noises. It's very consistent as well, though. The annoying intro sound is worked into the rest of the song, which reduces its annoyingness and helps it fall into the background.

Edit: I don't really find it annoying to listen to the same song on repeat forever, though, so YMMV. As long as it fits my requirements (bassy, loops well, simple lyrics)."

Don't stay up and worry. You need to do something fun yourself and enjoy life. I was once in a LDR and I was a lot more stressed when I didn't do anything with myself. I'd just sit around all depressed, waiting for a call that might never happen.


If you claim you trust him completely, I don't see why it should really make you question his actions. Trust doesn't just fall under the realm of whether or not you think a partner will cheat. Just take a deep breath and relax. If he's done this and before and isn't too crazy and irresponsible, trust him like you say you do.

My Rabbi spoke about Jethro telling Moses to get some judges, as it was a big judge. There are arguments among many Jewish commentaries if the order in the text is switched, as it makes little sense for there to be judges *before* Moses were to Sinai to get the law. What were they judging if there were only like six laws at this point?

He said it is because God is telling us to never forget the human element. Jewish law is not some calculation where we issue a ruling for its own sake. We are issuing a ruling for people. We can't ever forget that, and that the law must be flexible to account for that human element, and for the human condition. 

He ended off talking about the ramp to the tabernacle. The commentaries tell us it is because the priest did not wear undergarments, and steps would cause him to lift his leg, exposing himself to the stairs. With a ramp, we protect the modesty of now just the priest, but of the tabernacle. If we are so concerned with the stone, we should be so much more concerned about people."

Unless you have a wealthy and extremely generous grandmother giving you 1,000s for Christmas and birthdays I can't imagine you have enough to start really investing or worrying about high interest accounts. At your age the most important thing to be worrying about is budgeting and preparing for the immediate future. 

What you should be doing, is making a budget and sticking to it. You could use mint.com to help track everything you put on your debit card, or you could use an app like [moneywise](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handynorth.moneywise_free&amp;hl=en)  to track both your card and cash transaction. After you have that make a budget based on your monthly spending. Since you're 16 shouldn't have too many big expenses like gas, rent, or utilities so you should be able to put away a large amount of your income. At this point in the game, even if you have a few thousand I don't think you'll be making any real money off of interest, so don't even worry about it now. Just keep the money in your savings account and don't touch it. 

You should start saving up to buy a car, and for college (if thats what you choose). And don't go and buy a new car, or a slightly used car.

The only time it stopped was when I finally told my mom about it and she answered it for me, saying he called again she would call the police. He did anyway, so she did the same, and I never heard from him again, or about him.

The truth of the matter is, all of these occasions could have easily been caused by human error, not deliberate intention. The ""massacre"" at Qana was 4 shells landing at a UN compound, and yet its described as if the IDF threw dozens of shells into the camp in a lasting bombardment. 

If the IDF deliberately targeted civilians, it could do a lot worse. "

I think it's just one of those things where one of the central tenets of the Bible (people can change) clashes with our own tendencies to believe that some change is not possible (e.g. ""once a sinner, always a sinner""). It's very hard to be Christ-like for people, and accepting people for all their flaws (especially if you feel it affects you and your community) is even harder."

Yes, as I see today from Christian understanding of Jewish law... :P

I have read the NT three times. I have always gotten the impression that the authors do not have much understanding of Jewish law.

&gt;I think it's likely based on the gospels that, breach of custom aside, this practice was taking place in a lot of areas.

Except only the court in Jerusalem had the power to give the death sentence. And the King. 

&gt;I'd be interested to know whether or not that section of the Talmud is generally thought to be older and widespread at this time.

Mas. Makkos deals with a large chunk of corporal punishments. Mas. Sanhedrein deals with a large chunk of court cases, civil and capital.

My friend works nights cleaning. And I'm not sure what the situation is with the father of the baby. I had offered slightly after the baby was born that you know what? If you guys are itching for a couple hours away. Take a shower and *enjoy* it, or actually eat some lunch or grab a coffee with a friend. Or hell, take a fucking nap for 2 hours uninterrupted. I'll babysit. For free. 

I only live across the street from them and would be willing to have the baby over here or to babysit over there if that made everyone more comfortable. They haven't taken me up on the offer (the baby was only born early this month) but I figure I've seen enough mom's who would love to even just have 20 minutes to have a shower and just relax for a few minutes that I'd take the baby for a walk around the block (weather permitting of course!) or do something so they can just chill for a bit."

ephemeralcynosure,AskReddit,1390137561.0,"Oh, god.

I remember my first year of university I had an enormous crush on a guy that shared half of my classes. We talked occasionally, nothing serious. Toward the end of term, I decided to let the cat out of the bag and just tell him that he was hot and I was interested in mashing faces. Well, he was weirded out by what he called my ""uncomfortable forwardness"" and stopped speaking to me entirely.

I accepted the fate (knowing was better than wondering, after all) and thought I had moved on with my life. Except it was like every time I decided to go somewhere or do something... he was there. We were still connected by facebook, FourSquare, and Yelp, so in a panic after about three run-ins, I deleted him from everything. I guess because I thought it would be a display of ""I'm not stalking you.""

Turns out, I should have kept those connections and used them to AVOID him. I'd be out with a friend and she would want sushi, so we would hit up the nearest sushi restaurant... and there he was. I would need to pop into a professor's office to ask about an assignment... and, of course, he was already in that office. I would be heading to catch the train home after a day of classes and BOOM. Another impromptu meeting.

After more than a month and a half of this universe-fucking-with-me bullshit, I am heading down an unfamiliar road with a friend's address in hand. I was supposed to be meeting a group of people to work on a project, but her handwriting sucked and I couldn't quite decipher the house number. It potentially matched two houses across the street from each other. I frowned at the chicken scratch a moment or two and then went to knock on the door of the one I thought was more likely a match.

You'll never guess who answered the door.

Honestly, I'm surprised he didn't have grounds for a restraining order on me or something. After he rejected me, I didn't give two shits about this guy, but I *seriously* looked like a stalker from his point of view.

noname725,depression,1390137562.0,"It can be quite frustrating. I mean, I know that most people have good intentions, but hearing the same tired bits of obvious, shallow ""advice"" over and over again gets so old. If it were as simple as JUST getting more exercise, then no one would have depression. Sure, getting more exercise, being active, working on being physically healthier, etc. can help a lot of people in easing some symptoms of their depression, but it's absolutely not a 'cure' by any means. 

I think that a lot of it just has to do with all of the ignorance and misconceptions about mental illness in society. We've progressed a lot over the years, but there are still a lot of ignorant and/or negative attitudes that remain. A lot of people can't seem to understand it if they've never experienced it, but it's also not that hard to have empathy either. A lot of people don't think that it's ""real"" enough since they can't see it as easily as they can with some physical illnesses. It's very frustrating. 

Whether people intend to come off this way or not, it often feels like they're being condescending toward me...as if I'm too stupid to figure out that maybe getting more exercise would be beneficial. Still, it's not a cure. Again, I know that they're just trying to be nice, but I'd much rather just receive some support instead of feeling like I'm being judged or disbelieved or condescended to all the time."

She died January 16 2004 (holy shit it's been 10 years already!). They were married for around 60 years I guess then. (I don't know their exact wedding date or even an approximate year).

They had 2 daughters, who went on to have 2 and 3 children respectively, and they went on to have a total of 8 children between the 5 grandchildren. I am one of the great-grandchildren and I know I was lucky to have him until I was (almost) 22. I had hoped he would live to see me marry, and to make him a great-great-grandpa. But sadly that wasn't in the cards.

He was at peace though. He was ready. I think that's why I'm not nearly as upset about losing him as I was my grandma. I am upset, I miss him terribly. Don't misinterpret that at all. But with him, he was 95 and he had been without his one true love for 10 years. He was ready and wanted to be with her again. I could have asked him to stay and been selfish and tried to have him hang on longer. But sometimes it's just time to let them go and remember. 

I would love to see myself grow old gracefully like he did and surrounded by love like he was. He lived a full life and didn't have any regrets.

If she's told you she's seeing someone and she wants to ""catch up for a chat"" then it's most likely that that's all she wants to do. She is probably expecting a friendly cup of coffee and good conversation, not a secret seduction and hidden agenda. If you're not sure, ask her how the boyfriend is when you see her. If she says they are still together and doing great then back off and enjoy your friendship with her. If they are no longer together, then there's your chance. I think you're jumping to conclusions that she wants to cheat just because she's agreed to hang out with you. Most girls have guy friends and they don't drop them just because they have a boyfriend."

sorator,AskMen,1390138241.0,"Way late to the party here, buuut... do you have impulses to touch women and just not act on them, or do you not have that impulse at all?

I would guess the former, in which case there is *nothing* wrong or un-sexy about asking permission to do whatever you had the impulse to do, like tucking some stray hair behind her ear, or putting a hand on her back while walking, etc. 

If it's boundaries you're worried about, then ask! It's unusual, but (I suspect) it's not a turn-off. Respecting her boundaries is a **good** thing, and asking before touching her displays that good thing.

And as far as working on the attractive traits and building some confidence... *pretend* that you're confident and not worried about being creepy, and see how that goes. If you're normally worried about that, then even while pretending not to be, you'll still pay enough attention that you'll avoid being a complete creeper, and by trying to act like that isn't a crippling concern, you may be able to get past it. (I know that's harder to do than to say, but it's something.)

Also... you don't need to feel like you have anything to offer before diving into the scary world of relationships, heh. Most of us were there at some point. You learn by doing, so if it doesn't come naturally to you, you gotta go practice. You won't just magically become good at it when you turn 25 (which isn't what you said, I know, but still). Go talk to people. Ask someone out without making conditionals or apologies. It may not work, but that's fine - in the beginning you aren't really aiming for a girl to say yes right away anyway, you're just practicing walking up to someone and asking her out. (And if she does say yes, that's a very nice added bonus!)"

I think about it a lot and I have hundreds of scars, many of which are quite large and noticeable. I've been cutting (off and on) for almost a decade now. I really did not anticipate still being here and still doing this and still thinking about it so much at age 22. I'm supposed to be an 'adult' now, but I sort of feel like I'll always be that angsty 13-year-old...or, at least, that's how I'm made to feel. 

Self-harm can affect anyone, though, regardless of age, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc., so while I can understand beating yourself up about it or feeling self-conscious on a personal level, it's more than just a ""teen"" issue. We may hear about it happening with teens more, but so many adults struggle with it (or other self-destructive behaviors and habits) too. Maybe adults just feel like they can't talk about it as much. There's a stigma on self-harm, period, but I think there's even more of a stigma on it for people who aren't teens anymore."

I always wondered what steps and nakedness had to do with each other, but I know now, so thanks for sharing. It's incredible to think that God is cognizant of the human element in worship of Himself, when we humans sometimes forget it ourselves! A friend at church once reminded me that spending hours upon hours studying Scripture and worshipping God in quiet time or in prayer can be pleasing to God, but He does not just desire that 'vertical' relationship with us, but also encourages us to have a 'horizontal' relationship with others. I guess that's where the nuances of the law come into play - for God to foster that relationship between humans, being fully aware of the human condition."
AM89,AskReddit,1390138469.0,"I bounced nights at a student oriented bar/nightclub while I was at school.  This particular situation stood out only because I could relate to the kid when I was a little younger.

I was standing up by the bar and I overheard a bunch of 27ish year old guys standing around celebrating someone's birthday.  This guy had just turned 27 and literally looked like he just came out of his parents basement.  Very skinny, very pale skin and you could tell he didn't really take care of himself.  His buddies mentioned that they were going to get him laid tonight and they wanted him to pick out a girl.  He looks a little nervous but I guess the alcohol kicked in.  He walks up to this brunette directly in front of me and they started talking literally inches away from my face so I couldn't ***not*** pay attention.

Birthday Boy: ""Hi what's your name, I'm Birthday Boy""

Brunette: ""Hi, I'm Brunette""

Birthday Boy: ""That's a pretty name, it's my Birthday today""


Brunette: ""Oh really, how old are you? Happy Birthday!""

Birthday Boy: ""I'm 27, how about you?""

Brunette: ""Guess!""

I could tell she was a bit older but it would have been hard for him to figure it out after all the shots he had just done and the dark lighting of the club.  

Birthday Boy: ""I don't know, 35!""

Brunette then turns away from him with disgust and looks at me.  She asked me how old I thought she was and I just smiled and said it must be her 21st birthday today.  Turns out she was 29. 

Birthday Boy: ""It's ok, I'm into older women!""

Proceed with first facepalm.  Brunette laughs and turns away back to the bar.  Birthday boy then offers to buy her a drink which she was thrilled about and brings her mammoth bodybuilder of a boyfriend over.  Birthday boy proceeds to buy her and her boyfriend **both** drinks and then slinks back off to his buddies who are just staring at him in silence.

I felt bad for him but at the same time he's never going to learn without doing dumb things like that.  I cringed everytime I saw him for the rest of the night and he ended up getting asked to leave for drinking too much."

If folks let other people's prejudices control their behavior no minority or marginalized group - be they a person of color or a woman or an ethnic background - would be able to advance in life over the nay nay nay. 

I'm not here to deride the shorts who didn't 'make it' and call them the victims of their own weakness; I'm here to declare: ""I believe in you! I am no better - indeed, likely worse than some! - and here I stand; respected, loved, not afraid. What do you have to lose but your heels?""

I'm a firm believer in mirror behavior. Behave nobly, deserving, kind, compassionate, and joyfully - and people will eventually begin to treat you as though you deserve these things, as though you embody them. Act shifty, weak, whiny, woebegone and downtrodden - and you'll (continue to!) be trampled underfoot. Like chickens being henpecked, your own body language telegraphs a signal of the treatment YOU THINK YOU DESERVE, that you will allow yourself to be subjected to!

So while I am not victim blaming, (for much of the behaviors of marginalized groups are internalized from external models) I am definitely human-empowering here with knowledge of our internal locus of control.

I believe it is in our hands to shape our destinies; You want to see a world where short men don't have it harder than tall men?
You think short men are as good as tall men?
Just as sexy? Just as deserving of pay, raises, friends and love?
As smart? As desirable? As passionate, clever, and sexually awesome?

Although it would be much better to listen to someone with actual experience in your position, I would refer to the example of Jesus, who hung out with people that the religious of the time would condemn, like the lepers and prostitutes. 

While I'm sure that most of the people you fight with are great people, you could explain that you are conducting ministry in an area where few Christians are capable of ministering in due to the nature of the industry. The gospel is for everyone, fighters included. Maybe look at Ted Tebow for inspiration? Gridiron (American football?) isn't the most compassionate sport either, but Tebow honours Christ through it all.

Basically, instead of getting information directly from one server, you get parts of it from lots of different locations. A good example is if I download a GNU/Linux distro via torrent. I get the .torrent file, and I start downloading. Everybody else who has downloaded the same file (peers), and has left their bit-torrent client open, is now providing me with parts of the file. Because I'm getting it from so many places at once, I can max out my internet connection, because my download speed isn't bottlenecked by my connection directly to any one server.

The reason this is great is that you can distribute your digital product without having to pay large server costs, because the workload is distributed.

Right now I'm seeding 63 files, two of which are active. They're both executables from a Humble Bundle. Now even if the Humble Bundle servers go down, people can still download the things they've got. I'm seeding at about 47kB/s, which is nothing, and doesn't strain my connection at all, but with hundreds of other people doing it, the people downloading (who will then go on to seed, if they're polite), get their files at the maximum speed their connection will allow, without putting strain on one big server and slowing other people down.

It also helps stop information from dying. If there are a million copies of a file, all of which are accessible, you can raid the houses of fifty people involved, shut down their computers, and the file is still accessible. The maintainers of a project can get tired of it, and shut down their servers, but I just need the .torrent file, and I can download all their work. It's a way of accessing information, as well as helping other people access it, without having to host files on a dedicated server that costs money to buy and maintain.

Tl;dr: Fast speeds, distributed, immortal. Read Wikipedia, because I suck at explaining."

Chivalry is made by a game studio with little experience, and it's in its second iteration. Skyrim is made by a game studio with decades of experience and it's the 5th or 6th iteration of Elder Scrolls gameplay.

Chivalry has a small number of sales at a lower price. Skyrim has a gigantic number of sales at a much higher price. 

I'd say it's a realistic possibility for Elder Scrolls to design better combat mechanics. Part of the reason they don't is probably the game engine they're using, of course, but even modders in Oblivion managed to make much improved combat mechanics.

If they can't make something as good as Chivalry or Mount and Blade in terms of mechanics, at the very least they should have come up with something better by now.

GrillBears,motorsports,1390139573.0,"&gt;In an effort to extend a line growing obsolete in the face of advances in sports car design, Allard introduced an extended model in late 1951, the J2X. In an attempt to improve handling, the front suspension's rear attaching radius rods were redesigned with forward ones, which required a forward cross member and extending the nose out past the front wheels. This, in turn, allowed the engine to be moved forward, yielding more cockpit room. There is much confusion on the internet as to labelling of J2 and J2X types – the most obvious differences being that the J2 nose does not extend past the front tires and has two vents below the grill, while the J2X nose extends past the front tires and usually has a single vent below the grill placed on a more protruding chin. Tom Lush, author of ""Allard: The Inside Story"" said in the book that the chin was the most obvious difference between the two. In standard form the spare wheel was carried on top of the rear mounted fuel tank however, either version could carry one or two side mounted optional spares this to allow the use of a 40 gallon long distance fuel tank.

&gt;The J2X was not as successful in international racing as the J2, as it became less competitive against more advanced Jaguar C and D types, Ferraris, and Maserati works cars it headlined less often in major international races. Of 199 documented starts in major races in the 9 years between 1952 and 1960, J2X's garnered 12 first place finishes; 11 seconds; 17 thirds; 14 fourths; and 10 fifth places.

ephemeralcynosure,AskReddit,1390139887.0,"I had seen this guy a couple times, met him through a mutual friend, blahblah. He invited a small group of people over for a party. As guests started leaving one by one, he ended up pulling out some old box of things he had been keeping and showing them to me. A lot of his shit was boring or kind of weird (ex. an empty chip bag from a summer camp ten years prior). I indulged him because I liked making out, okay?

Anyway, he pulls out this envelope and holds it gingerly with a content look on his face. After I prompted him to explain why he was fondly cradling said envelope, he opened it and showed me its contents. Hair. Locks of hair in varying colors. All from his ex girlfriend. Every time she changed her hair style, he would request a lock of her hair and keep it in this creeper envelope.

I couldn't quite keep the expression of disbelief off my face and it prompted him to put the box away. I had convinced myself to forgive him for this eccentricity (he had many--he was literally an artist of the kookiest kind in Portland, OR) mostly because he was hot and I was hoping to get lucky that night. But I was fully aware of how weird it was.

Anyway, we were putting some stuff away from the party and I opened the fridge to put a few sodas away when, in the vegetable crisper, a neon blue liquid catches my eye. I slowly pull the drawer open and see a plastic container with a few fish and a lizard floating in it. I could feel my attraction dying. Just as slowly, I closed the drawer again and turned to put away the ice cream that was still on the counter. When I opened the freezer, I was face to face with a dead bird and, before I could stop myself, I said, ""Why the FUCK is there a dead bird in your freezer?""

His response was, ""I found it on the side of the road and wanted to do something with it.""

I got myself out of that house in under three minutes and, strangely, he never tried calling me again.

**TL;DR Hot, Portland artist-type guy has ex's hair in an envelope and dead animals in the fridge and freezer.**"

Girls want to be included in your life not be your life.

My experience with women is they will never ever tell you when they are free. It weakens their position that way if you say 'i knoaw you are free lets do x' and she isn't interested she has to directly reject you. If she likes you and just isn't interested(insert any reason) she can say she is busy.

Coalesced,short,1390140516.0,"I have noticed that a lot of women sort of default check for height as a factor - then when they meet me, are disappointed by my height for an instant - then that slowly dissolves. The experience with me teaches them height doesn't matter as solidly as they thought. 

Most women I meet, anyhow. A very few are harder to bring around.

I get people who are totally surprised when I share that I am Mexican-American, and they get confused. (But.. he speaks English well and is educated? But.. he looks white? But.. I hate Mexicans.. except.. this fellow was soooo nice.. until I.. realized.. I might be a bit erroneously prejudiced..) 

It's the same sort of silly thing that happens when you meet someone for the first time and -- I don't know, maybe some men expect a blonde, or a bustier girl. I personally have a taste for a diverse spectrum of beauty, and ultimately size, shapes and colors -while important, as I value health and vigor in my partners - matter less than a keen, lovely brain. It's programmed into my selection; I'll find a person more or less attractive based on a blend of their intelligence, physical health and sensitivity. No single 'make or break' trait exists for me -- as 'short' seems to be for some women, some sort of threshold. 

I might have enough extraneous positive traits to overwhelm the height consideration, but I was a chubby, awkward, panic-attack having acne-riddled little guy - all gains have come from a place of 'weakness'.

Essentially I am saying I am not better than anyone - if I can do it, so can you. I don't think people should bootstrap themselves, but I do think people can take their lives into their hands."

tetromino_,TrueAskReddit,1390140549.0,"I've just bought a place, and had many conversations with mortgage lenders about qualifying for a loan. The basic message I got was, there were new regulations passed after the financial bubble burst, and getting a normal fixed-rate mortgage is currently rather difficult.

Even if you have great credit and enough savings for a 30-50% down payment, you *still* need an uninterrupted 2-year history of employment in your field (documented by filing US income taxes on it) and a current permanent position that files W-2 tax forms. If your income comes from something that does not result in a W-2 form (say, you are self-employed, or working remotely for a foreign company, or an independent contractor, or on an academic fellowship), the banks will pretty much see you as toxic. The *best* you might expect to qualify for is some kind of adjustable-rate time bomb.

My suggestion is to get a co-borrower. Somebody who you know and trust, who has lived in the US for years, and has a traditional job for a company or government organization that files W-2 forms. The bank will require that person's name to be on your home title. After a few years, you might be able to refinance and change the title to be only in your name."

After my ex-girlfriend left me a couple of years ago, I spent a long time depressed and let myself get dissuaded from getting a motorcycle and doing other things she did not want me to do because she didn't want to go through losing anyone else. It took me a long time to realize I can't live for her and the reason she had seen anything in me in the first place was I lived for myself and had my shit together. Now I'm going out and looking for my next car (a last gen firebird) and living my life as I did before my heartbreak, for ME. Sure, it gets lonely sometimes, and my mom recently told me she and my father don't expect to get grandkids from me (I'm 23 and apparently buying a sports car and enjoying life makes me not husband material... ) but the more I find solace in making alone time me time, the more I realize that's my best bet of finding the kind of person I need in my life again.

I've also experienced this with people that I've come out to as trans who have only known me in girl mode - I end up being treated as neither.

Because gender is so tied into how these people view and treat people, I end up being treated as a non-person, and all of a sudden, questions about genitalia, my old name, how I masturbate, etc are (somehow) no longer inappropriate.

Let's assume we try to switch to electric cars (personal cars are going to be a requirement, to avoid a mass exodus from the suburbs where you cannot walk anywhere). Now think about the supporting infrastructure required - increased electric generation and distribution capabilities, charging stations (potentially in locations different than where gas stations are), and a huge burden on the general population to *replace the entire private fleet*. What is the ecological impact of all of this (batteries are not exactly ""clean"" to make)? Are there even enough of the rare earth metals necessary to make all of these batteries?

Inb4 someone says that I'm an idiot and I should look for plugins that do X. I have. The plugin library is by no means end-all be-all. Some are badly deprecated. It's just very messy and fiddly.

The one positive note that I will say about foobar2k it that it transcodes music extremely well. Most other jukeboxes either fail at managing album art, fail at transfering the ID3 tags properly or fuck up in other ways, for example when unicode characters are involved. So props to that.

Otherwise don't recommend this to an average computer user. Fucking around with DLL files is not fun.

fnredditacct,AskMen,1390141502.0,"I don't know what we are meant to learn from life, or why things happen. There are times when things are so impossibly hard and overwhelming. When I feel like it is too much, how is someone suppose to keep going, and why, what is left? I think of my grandmother.

Let's call her B.

Here is her story, as I understand it:

Born in 1924, extremely premature. Her sister says less than 3 lbs and no one expected her to live. The wrapped her in cotton and put her behind the pot belly stove. They fed her milk that she sucked out of a cloth. Somehow she lived. 

Their mother left, I'm unclear on exactly the order of events, I believe she had colon cancer, but also think that she went back to Europe to be with her lover.

B was left with her significantly older sister to raise her. Her sister married and from the time B was 11 until she left the house, everyday when my Great Aunt went out, her husband raped B. Everyday.

When B became a young adult she worked in a secretary like capacity. There was a young military man that came in to their office frequently for a period of time. He was very good looking and all the girls in the office flirted with him. B tells me, ""I knew I would be the one to get him.""

She did. They fell in love.  They got married. They had 10 kids. In between #5 and 6 or 6 and 7, she had a stillbirth. She carried that pregnancy almost all the way, if not all the way, to full term. That boy was born dead. B told me she has never forgotten that child and still celebrates and mourns his birthday every year.

When their youngest child was ~10 months, and their oldest a young teen, B's husband had some medical emergency *(details on this very unclear, perhaps seizure, perhaps something else)* while driving. His car crashed and he died. I don't know if the accident killed him, or if whatever it was that caused the accident would have killed him anyway.

B was left alone. With 10 children.

She learned to drive. Went back to work. Supported all those kids.

Four of those 10 have died in my lifetime. Cancer. I have watched her process those deaths and mourn them.  It never seems to get easier.  I have seen the anger, the grief. I have watcher her put up their pictures in her bedroom and pray for them.

B never remarried. I think that, at least in her twilight years, she has had a fling or two.  But I don't think she has ever felt the love and connection she had with her husband.

When B talks to me about him, she is not sad. The look on her face with she said, ""your grandfather,"" made me believe in soulmates at a young age. I see the connection she feels to him is still there. But it does not weigh her down.

She is not an unhappy person. She is almost always smiling. She holds each new grandchild with a look of unfathomable joy on her face. She argues with them when become toddlers and talk back. 

She never criticizes me for not calling enough, but always expresses how happy she is to hear from me. She knew my husband was the one for me the first time she met him. I have never seen her happier than when she watched us get married.

I like when she argues with her dog. Mostly it's about if the dog is eating enough, or too much, or has had too much water, or not enough. B's dog just looks at her, completely unfazed, until she starts laughing and picks her up. 

I have tried to talk to B about how she has survived these things. What is it that has kept her going? How does she continue to find so much pleasure in life? I don't know what I would do without my husband. I am terrified that my destiny will be similar to hers. I am even more terrified that it won't be similar enough and I won't have his children before he is taken from me, or I from him.

But I am too scared to bring these things up in the depth I want to. It seems cruel and unfair to force her to relive those pains in front of me, instead of letting us enjoy the pleasure of each others company.

She is not perfect. I live with the tragedy of the mistakes she's made, seen the toll they took on my mother, aunts and uncles. 

But I am in awe of her.

I am in awe, not just that she survived, but continues to love life, and be happy. I am in awe that she is not bitter, not angry.

I feel that strength in me, deep down. Sometimes I want to just lay in bed, and pretend life is not a precious jewel given to me. But I feel that strength inside. I know where I come from. I know what I can do.

I have seen what she has done.

If she can keep finding the beauty in life, through trauma, tragedy, pain, loss, grief, aging, then it has to be there. 

Even when sometimes I can't see it, I know it must be there, because she sees it.

I don't know if that is helpful for you in any way. But it was the best I had to share.

Good luck OP. Life is beautiful, and it will keep being there for you, waiting, for whenever you can see it.

Once you stop watching TV, to turn the interaction to mainly talking. /u/Alexfortomorrow has basically covered it. When you both stop talking and you have you hand(s) on her belly (an area guys normally only touch when they are fucking her), pause the conversation and look into her eyes, mentally express the way you feel, your eyes seem to should it. Move in etc.
&gt;When she asked to go for a smoke I finally managed to say ""Only if you kiss me first."" she responded with something along the lines of ""You want me to kiss you? That is the man's job.. bla bla bla...""

*The required handrail is to be ""continuous"" of the length of the stairs. The term continuous means that not only a single handrail must run from the top riser to the bottom riser, but it also indicates that users should be able to grasp the handrail and maintain their grasp without having to release the rail where it is supported.*  
  
I see numerous instances where you cannot maintain a continuous grasp. On top of that I see a lot of pinch points where your finger could get caught/injured.

FrenchFuck,AskMen,1390142159.0,"You have to define what being a man is for yourself, **especially** when it subverts society's definition. 

Your entire life you will hear men and women trying to tell you what a ""real man"", they are all clueless, each and every one of them. They confuse maturity with masculinity, they confuse success with masculinity, they confuse mastery with masculinity.

I think one of the first things every young man should do is to look at how diverse men are. Question everything. Find all the pieces that don't fit, what do they have in common? Be wary, especially those who believe they have found ""the right path"", who give you a promise of a positive and non-conflicting identity. To be a man is to be, sometimes, contradictory, which really means **you are human**. 

Every man reaches a point where he has to ""choose"" between his masculinity or his humanity, this is the myth of masculinity. Every boy who chooses to idealize masculinity above his humanity begins the, sometimes life-long, process of self-torture, of inner psychic conflict. Juxtaposing his emotions with an ideal, his happiness with arbitrary goals, his life with a fantasy.

Here is a quote from Erikson that I think is helpful (emphasis and quotations marks are mine)

&gt; Identity formation normatively has its dark and negative side, which throughout life can remain an unruly part of the the total identity. Every person and every group harbours a **negative identity** as the sum of **all** those identifications and identity fragments which the individual had to submerge in himself as undesirable or irreconcilable or which his group has taught him to perceive as the mark of fatal ""difference"" in sex role or race, in class or religion. In the event of an aggravated crises, an individual (or, indeed, a group) may despair of the ability to contain these ""negative"" elements in a ""positive"" identity. A specific rage can be aroused wherever identity development thus loses the promise of an assured wholeness: an as yet uncommitted delinquent, if denied any chance of communal integration, may become a ""confirmed"" criminal. In **periods of collective crisis**, such potential rage(confusion) is shared by many and is **easily exploited by psychopathic leaders**, who become the models of a sudden surrender to doctrines and dogmas in which a negative identity appears to be the desirable and dominant one.

The_British_One,disability,1390142174.0,"Sorry this is a bit late but I guess I'll throw in my 2 cents.

As teenagers most people can be very shallow. They want an SO who will impress their friends and boost them in the social hierarchy. So people like us who are unique, out of the ordinary and a bit ""different"" aren't always going to end up with the right people.

Equally, a lot of people don't really fully understand disabilities. A few of my ex-girlfriends just didn't understand why I needed them to do most of the physical stuff when we were intimate, or why I was never going to be able to literally sweep them off their feet. And they can't accept that. They *know* you have some kind of issue, but they don't understand it and even if they claim they do, they don't particularly care. 

But as we grow older people mature. They become more accepting, less focused on what other people perceive and start looking for happiness within themselves. That's where people with disabilities thrive. From what I've found, people with extra burdens in the life tend to be more resilient and have much stronger and better personalities. And adults looking for relationships are much more focused on personality compatibility than looks. 

So I think in time you'll be fine. You'll find the right person, someone who understands the challenges you go through and who will be able to support you. 

Sounds like this guy isn't worth your time. He didn't seem to care enough about you to consider the difficulties you face when he was with you. The best idea is to move on and keep looking for someone who will look out for you and look after you, and always keep in mind the things you have to deal with."

First off: Rush out the Smash Bros. Open Beta for the Wii U. Have it be multiplayer-only, feature about 5 characters and 5 stages at a time that rotate as development continues. Then, crazy idea here: Make Smash 4 a free download for every Wii U for the first 3 months after its release.  

Second: (2)DS player for Wii U. The Wii U is effectively a home DS, with its two screens and touchpad. So a little add-on that permits users to player DS and 3DS games on their TV would be quite cool. Bonus points if they can render in HD.

Third: Gamecube Virtual Console and Gamecube-shaped Pro Controller. There's a treasure trove of games here. No reason to sit on them.

Fourth: Zelda Wii U, it'll sell systems. 'Nuff Said.

Fifth: First party game discounts to downloads just like Steam.

Sixth: (Longshot here, probably not the best idea by any means): Steam integration, permitting the playing of all Wii U games in your Steam library.

Seventh: Share downloads between one Wii U and up to... say... 4 3DS's. (Virtual console/cross-platform games).

Eighth: Find some awesome casual software/hardware gimmick combo like Wii Fit, and market it to the masses. 8-year-old Jimmy has a much better chance of getting a Wii U for birthday/Christmas if his parents think they'll use the console as well.

Ninth: Emphasize the Wii U's streaming abilities of Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video, and Youtube, its competent web browser, and skype-like capabilities.

Tenth: (Super Longshot here): Contact Disney, hire everyone from the former Factor 5, and have them remake the Rogue Squadron games into a one-disk HD version. They're work on the Gamecube still looks modern today, and they would be able to squeeze every last gram of power from the little system, demonstrating its abilities.

Eleventh: Run an offensive ad campaign. Emphasize that the xbox and Playstations can do hardly anything that the PC cannot. Point out the uniqueness of the game pad and show examples of the gameplay opportunities it provides.

Nintendo won't 'win' this generation, but it can certainly be salvaged for a profit."

YellowOrbitz,fatlogic,1390142434.0,"It really does depend on the person. If you put two separate people on the same diet (if they are around the same height and such), they aren't going to have the same exact body. One might have bigger boobs, one might have smaller hips, ect. Some girls are naturally more petite, and others are naturally ""thicker."" When I say thicker I mean slightly larger thighs, not 30 lbs overweight. Once you start getting into the 25+ overweight area you know it's not genetics anymore. 

There is a kind of a set point, but it's in the healthy body weight range, not 300 lbs overweight or 20 lbs underweight range. I know while I'm skinny, I could never have incredibly thin legs without starving myself (although I don't want them to get any smaller, I love them), just like a girl who has ""stick legs"" couldn't get legs like mine unless she over ate. At that point though she would probably end up gaining a stomach more than anything. 

People wear weight differently. Sometimes it goes all to your ass, sometimes your boobs. Sometimes your stomach. There is a difference in everyone's body, but not a difference so great you're going to be morbidly obese and there's nothing you can do about it. "

Steven Spielberg was discussing his newest project - an action docudrama about famous composers, starring top movie stars. Sylvester Stallone, Steven Seagal, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger were all being courted for the top roles.  
Hoping to have the box office ""oomph"" of these superstars, Spielberg was prepared to allow them to select the composers they would portray, providing they were among the most famous.  
""I have always admired Mozart,"" declared Stallone. ""I would really love to play him.""  
""I have always been partial to Strauss and his waltzes,"" stated Seagal. ""He is the one I would like to play.""  
""Chopin has always been my favorite and my image would improve if people saw me playing the piano,"" Willis said. ""I'll play him.""  
Spielberg was very pleased with these choices. ""Sounds splendid,"" he said. Then, turning to Schwarzenegger, he asked, ""Well Arnold, who would you like to be?""  
""I'll be Bach!"" Schwarzenegger replied.

Bearmodule,AskMen,1390142964.0,"When I say well trained, I mean they have an *intensive* training course, they have to prove they're better than all the thousands upon thousands of other police officers who are also applying for the AFO position, they have to have spend a *minimum* of two years as a regular bobby - though most spend many more years than this.

They're also retested on weapons every four months, and they have to requalify for the role each year. Failing any of the tests, or not meeting requalification requirements means that they can have their role revoked.

Wikipedia can probably explain better so:

&gt;All police forces in the United Kingdom have an AFO selection process, varying slightly between each force. As with many police specialities, all Authorised Firearms Officers have volunteered for the role. Candidates are required to gain approval from their superiors before embarking on a series of interviews, psychological and physical fitness tests, medical and assessment days before permission to commence firearms training is approved. There is no guarantee of success; candidates can be returned to their previous role at any point in training.

&gt;Authorized Firearms Officers are invited to attend the Training Centre, after they have undergone the written tests and interviews along with the successful completion of their probationary period, with a further two years in a core policing role. The potential AFOs undergo one week of intensive weapons training—in 2012 on the Glock 17 self-loading pistol and the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5SF semi-automatic carbine (a semi-automatic version of the fully automatic MP5). Some police forces additionally issue their AFO's with the Heckler &amp; Koch G36, a rifle with accurate range of 800 m. This is followed by a further six weeks of training focused on ARVs, such as driving techniques, high speed pursuit methods and safely executing controlled crashes.

&gt;Once authorised, firearms officers must go through regular refresher courses and retests in all aspects of their training in order to keep their firearms 'ticket', such as being tested every four months, and requalifying for the role each year. Failing in any aspect can result in the officer having their ticket revoked. Any health issues which arise can also result in temporary or permanent suspension from firearms duties

tl;dr it's super tough to get anywhere near a gun as a police officer here, once you do you better maintain those standards or you're out"

It costs about $100,000 a year to train one apprentice. That's $400,000 for their full apprenticeship. You get some good work out of apprentice during their later years to offs wet the costs, but in the beginning an apprentices is a money pit that gets paid for out of dues."

She would have more difficulty overpowering him, (again, assuming they are average people, no weapon). The threat would not be as great to him as it would be to her.

Not that he would! Not that leaving a note implies that he is a bad guy.

021fluff5,knitting,1390143334.0,"[Purl Bee](http://www.purlbee.com/knitting-tutorials-decorative/2011/10/16/brioche-stitch-2-color-brioche-in-the-round.html) also has a nice tutorial. They have a pattern for a brioche [vest](http://www.purlbee.com/the-purl-bee/2013/9/26/lauras-loop-brioche-vest.html) too.

In general, when you want to modify something so that it can be knit in the round, you just reverse every other row. Convert your knit stitches to purl stitches (and vice versa), then start at the end of the line in the pattern and work your way to the beginning. For sweaters, skip the balancing stitches. (If it says to cast on a multiple of 3 stitches plus one, just cast on a multiple of three.) Since you're not going to be seaming anything, you don't need the extra stitches.

It's way easier to do this if you rewrite the entire pattern first, rather than try to reverse things in your head as you go along."

It's not about eating anything you want because at the end of the day if you eat 4000 calories you're going to gain weight (unless you're an athlete training or something). 

You can tell the difference between girls who are just tiny but do eat a healthy amount, and girls who have an eating disorder. There's a very distinct look. Shape really does have to do with size, because a girls who putting it in her boobs is going to look smaller than a girl who's putting it in her stomach.

The_British_One,sex,1390143499.0,"I was 17. Met a beautiful girl, dated for a few months long-distance then went up to visit her in the school holidays. Her parents didn't like the idea of me staying round their house so I got a nice-ish hotel room and she came and stayed with me. Met her at the hotel, we went up to the room, watched TV and talked for a bit, then started kissing etc. 

She had already been with a few guys, but I'd never do anything more than making out so I was really quite oblivious to her hints. (looking back there are some really quite obvious hints I should've gotten, but alas). Eventually she just said ""I don't want to just kiss you all night"" and so I went down on her, then she went down on me, and before I knew it, I was lying on my back, and she was kissing me as she got on me. I didn't even realise she was at first. Then I felt it and it was the best feeling I've ever had. I didn't get the chance to put on a condom but she was on birth control.

We went for about 90 minutes (I take viagra for a heart problem, so I guess that's why I last so long my first time). I finished, she laid beside me and we fell asleep in each other's arms. Woke up and did it again at about 4am, then again in the morning before we went on a date. 

Only regret was that the relationship died quite quickly after. No regrets about who I lost it to or how though. She was gorgeous but our personalities really clashed and it would never have lasted even if we'd tried to make it. "

&gt; Do you have way of knowing where specific stories end and begin?

You've got to keep up with the news, interviews and solicitations, especially solicitations or looking up the issues on the site (e.g. DC or Marvel's site).  Usually, they'll tell you when an arc is ending (""Conclusion to ______!"").  New arc is the best place time to jump on a series.

.

&gt; Or do you just dive in an try to figure it out?

As Tony Guerrero, from Comic Vine, said ""You're not stupid"" (in the most jokingly and kind way), you can figure this out.  This was in reference to issue counts and jumping on.

High number issues are intimidating and new readers would think that they'd have to read the previous 700 or 900 issues.  You don't.  What you should look for are the ends and beginnings of arcs.  There's your story: The arc.  That's where you jump on.

If you want to jump on now, just do.  IIRC, I jumped on Aquaman (phrasing) with #24, it was the penultimate to the current arc at the time.  No idea what was happening but I just know I'll catch with trades some day or go back issue hunting to complete the arc.  Also, I was lucky to jump on that particular issue because it had hell of a backstory and I just pieced together plots out of thin air.

I also jumped on with Superior Spider-Man with #20, it was more of a filler issue as well as the issue after that, until ""Darkest Hours"" arc started and ended with #25 (as you can see on the sidebar: ""Pull of the Week."")

So, just wait for the next arc by researching or jump on the current available arc."
