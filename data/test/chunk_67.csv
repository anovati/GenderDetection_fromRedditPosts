TheThunderbird,ft86,1390463139.0,"I had the exact same experience as a 23 year old.  I arrived in a new country with no credit, had a rental car and 7 days to buy a car.  No dealer was willing to take me seriously and I understand why, but it didn't make me any less frustrated. I went to almost 10 dealers before, by complete chance, I found a salesperson who was willing to *help* me.  He understood that I *would buy the car* if he stopped trying to sell and started helping with delivery, financing, registration etc. (Andy at Secor Subaru, btw)

Here's my advice:

* **Find a dealer and salesperson in advance.**  Ask around to find out who will go the extra mile.

* **Make an appointment.**  Phone in advance and ask to meet with a specific salesman and setup a time.  This shows them that you're a serious buyer and not just kicking tires.

* **Know your stuff.**  Do your research.  Know the differences between the models, what the dealer has in stock, what options those cars have, the list price, what promos are going on, etc.

Salespeople are only comfortable when they control the situation.  Flip the situation around.  If there's nothing they can tell you that you don't already know, they'll either try to argue with you or they'll listen to what you're telling them to do."

What really matters is learning how to *feel* it. A returning gaze, a lingering touch. Sometimes you just *know* and as long as you follow this gut feeling, trying to keep your insecurities from clouding your view, you will slowly but surely become better at this 'sixth sense'.

FountainsOfFluids,AskMen,1390463490.0,"I agree that it's not good to settle for something you can't live with, but you should also know that if you wait for perfection you will end up alone. Instead, you need to ask yourself if the person is worth what you sacrifice for them. All relationships are sacrifice in one way or another, starting with not having sex with other people. But heck, even that can be negotiated sometimes.

Anyway, the point is that if you really love somebody, then you are willing to sacrifice things to be with them, and wearing a condom might be one of them. You should look for the person who is worth sacrificing for, and stop obsessing over what you are giving up. It's an attitude adjustment that comes with maturity."

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390463671.0,"&gt;my opinions are not seen as valid 

**Mod hat**: Having opinions is fine and so is expressing them. But as a mod, I can't enforce who sees them as valid or not.  Nor am I particularly willing to - that's asking people to change their beliefs.

**Personal user**: To me, unexamined opinions aren't valid; those are feelings. I simply can't respect, for example, a Jew who identifies as Reform who cannot tell me right now, without Googling, what their movement leaves out of the Sh'ma and the Reform movement's rationale for doing so. 

I can disagree with the Reform rationale for doing so without disrespecting someone who understands what Reform Judaism espouses, assessed their beliefs, and actively identifies as such.

I have similar ""tests"" for Conservatives and Reconstructionists regarding word changes in the Aleinu, lest you think I am being unduly harsh on Reformers. 

Note: 85% of my own Conservative synagogue fails the Conservative version of my test.

I can't respect these kinds of Jews because it means they don't understand their movement's theology and haven't examined their Judaism to make an informed choice; this is even more hypocritical of Reform Jews, to me, given their movement's championing of this value.

&gt;or as being ""really Jewish"" because I am not Orthodox

**Mod hat**: This we can absolutely do something about. This we want to put a halt to. But, we really and honestly can't see everything, and even if we could, we can't always anticipate how people will feel in response to everything. That's why it's absolutely critical to write us with the link in mod mail when you see it.

**Personal user**: I have argued on behalf of my movement and Reform here. I'm happy to dig through my history if you want proof. Or I can ping some users who received my comments in response to their own. 

What upsets me is that there are two regular Reformers and five regular Conservativians here (according to the graphs included above). There are at least 30+ semi-regulars and lurkers who could just as easily show up, or piggy back, on the defense of their movements. 

That's my issue with this post, even. It's been up for roughly 24 hours at this point. Assuming that no behind-the-scenes reddit bots are included in the upvote/downvote count, that means only 17 people even bothered to express an opinion on this. Of the thirteen current upvotes, I know at least two came from Orthodox members because they told me so. That means, at best, 11 non-Orthodox members even did the simple, easy, anonymous, fearless task of hitting a digital orange arrow. On a post specifically proposing ideas on how to engage them better. 

So to me, right now, this request for greater respect is also coupled with a large degree of apathy, lack of involvement, or whatever else you want to call it, from the Liberal Jews here. I didn't spend 30 minutes last night thinking up these ideas in direct response to people's suggestions for improvement because I don't care about you guys. But I'd say at least a quarter of the responders in this thread are some of our Orthodox regulars!


&gt;People have specifically said ""no other movement is Judaism."" I find that to be incredibly insulting.

**Mod hat**: As you should. Please send a message to the mods with the link.

**Personal user**: As you should. Please send a message to the mods with the link. Or me, since I don't mind telling people they're being deliberately obtuse in a self-declared non-denominational Jewish forum.  But as a non-Orthodox user, I think that onus to represent my movement is on me. And I will happily rise to the occasion; I take a hard(er)-line stance in this arena (even when it doesn't align with my own personal beliefs) than our IRC chatroom precisely so the Reform and Conservative lurkers know they're not alone.

&gt;Adding cultural content is a band aid.

**Mod hat**: 10 people in the survey have specifically requested it. And multiple people in posts have also stated they want it. It's something we can do rather easily, so I am happy to listen to the community members and implement something they're asking for.  I sincerely hope it provides a venue for our Liberal Jewish readers to become involved in ways they find meaningful.

**Personal hat**: I agree with you. I agree with you because I think the desire for this kind of content comes precisely from those individuals who whine about wanting it but have yet to take initiative on their own to find the content they want and to post it. Or to comment when that kind of content is posted.

&gt;If people feel unwelcome and they are spoken to harshly they will not contribute their thoughts.

**Mod hat**: The mods before I was recently added have specifically responded to request to be more inclusive and respectful of Liberal Jews. They've created weekly series to encourage learning, posts where we can get to know each other as people and not scary/mean archetypes of our movements, and share what Jewish activities (of any kind!) that we've done this week. They've warned and banned members who vocally harped on Jews who were different from them.

And in response to their effort, Reform and Conservative participation has not increased in any significant way. And instead of Reform and Conservative members saying, ""hey, appreciate this, but that's not helping with this problem or that issue"", which would help tremendously in figuring out how to make this community work for all, we get radio silence except for then the opportunity to complain about the Orthodox appears.

**Personal user**: What I see more of is Liberal Jews being questioned by the Orthodox and being unwilling or unable to answer the questions. And I don't get it - because if these are beliefs and worldviews you believe in, why aren't they worth defending in a forum that you seek out precisely because of those beliefs and worldviews you hold? Not always, because not everyone has the time or energy for that, clearly. But some of the time. Since the downvotes have been returned, someone has been seeking me out for downvotes. I don't know why, it does bother me, but at the end of the day they're purple virtual arrows from someone I don't know. Clearly I'm doing something right if they feel so convinced to seek me out and downvote.

&gt;Description of events in kosher post

**Mod hat**: Someone asked what kashrut rule people had a hard time following and provided an example of what they have difficulty with. They didn't ask for people who don't have problems with keeping kosher to not respond. They didn't ask for suggestions or help on how to bridge the chicken-dairy map. The one person got snarky the time I saw that thread got a response from me as a personal user, and that has been upvoted a few times."

Chocobean,Marriage,1390463696.0,"What did you guys decide on, about this, before you were married? I'm sure the discussion has come up? 

Honest question: What do you think a marriage is, and what does he/she think it is?

My spouse and I were on the same page with regards to its definition, before we got married: my spouse and I will leave our own families, form our own new family, where we are each the priority to the other, bar none. My spouse is more important to me than my job, than my family, and our children. If ever I need to choose, I will choose my spouse, forsaking all others. That's in the vows, isn't it?

When you made that promise to love him/her and forsake all others,  you did so (I hope) with the knowledge and acknowledgement that he/she completes you, that to be together is a happier thing and more fulfilling than being with your family, getting the best job, and having kids. So. 

&gt;Is it possible for me to walk away from this job and be content on being average?

It is indeed possible if you deem her happiness your happiness. 

&gt;Similarly, is it possible to walk away from this marriage, go off into space, and be OK?

define okay. Divorced? Sure. Marriage in tact? That can work too if you make concessions elsewhere.

&gt;Would it be more healthy to begin fixing this or consider walking away? 

If you consider marriage to be the coming together of two people, joining as one flesh, and of divorce to be akin to cleaving one person into two halves, then nothing is worse than walking away. If you consider marriage to be where two people who feel in love can enjoy happiness and companionship as long as the feeling lasts, walk away immediately and never look back;  you've got happier days ahead with any number of others. 

If I were your spouse, the family thing would never be an issue: your happiness is my happiness. If you were my spouse, the job thing wouldn't be an issue either: you can always find fulfillment doing other stuff as long as you have me--since I will be happy, you will be happy, too. 

What's going on here that neither of you feel like you can budge, or even work out a compromise?

tl;dr: only you can tell yourself what a marriage means to you. "

Ching_chong_parsnip,sweden,1390463964.0,"Ja, skadestånd i Sverige är låga. Den generella principen (civilrättsligt) är att skadestånd bara ska utgå för faktiska kostnader man har lidit. I brottmål kan man få skadestånd för kränkningen som brottet innebar och även för att man lidit psykiskt, s.k. sveda och värk. Det är dock *brottsoffret* som man tar hänsyn till allt som oftast. Skadeståndet till målsäganden vid mordförsök är som standard 100 000 kr.

I vissa situationer har Högsta domstolen dock funnit att även anhöriga kan få skadestånd, t.ex. vid mord. Schablonbeloppet är 50 000 kr vid uppsåtligt dödande, och 25 000 kr vid icke uppsåtligt dödande. Antagligen är beloppen lägre än vad brottsoffret får vid t.ex. mordförsök, eftersom det inte är just brottsoffret som lider den aktuella skadan.

Så visst kan man tycka att 80 000 kr är lågt, men sett i sitt sammanhang och mot praxis är det ett högt belopp."

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390464148.0,"Depends on your definition of ""tea.""  Europeans have been brewing herbs since time immemorial.  The descriptions that we have tend to be for brews made for medical purposes.  Pennyroyal tea (to reference an old Nirvana song), for example, had the reputation for being an abortificant.  Black tea from India or China received the same medicinal treatment in Early Modern European texts.  In Poland-Lithuania, my area of expertise, black tea is not really popular until the second half of the eighteenth century and not a household staple until a century later. Even then, it tends to be seen as a medicinal brew as opposed to a recreational beverage we think of today.  If you're looking for research materials, off the top of my head I can think of a few earlier descriptions in Jesuit travel accounts, including Giovanni Pietro Maffei's ""Le istorie dell' Indie Orientali"" (History of East India) from the late sixteenth century.  The earliest account I can think of from Central Eastern Europe comes from Michał Boym's travel journal.  Boym was a Polish Jesuit, a missionary and a papal ambassador to China in the middle of the seventeenth century.  In his ""Rerum Sinensium Compendiosa Descriptio"" (A short description of Chinese things) he provides a description of Chinese and Japanese drinking the ""bitter"" beverage, but doesn't give very many clues regarding his own experiences, aside from (borrowing from an article translation here): ""It is refreshing on hot days, all the while preventing (kidney?) stones and sleepiness.""  As we can see, Boym is still looking at tea as a medicinal brew rather than a casual beverage of the day, like beer or wine."

* I am truly beautiful, inside and out.
* I'm hot. 
* I am brilliant.
* I am affectionate.
* I love sex.
* I'm an excellent girlfriend, and an excellent friend/partner.
* I love laughter and banter.
* I am cool as fuck. Seriously.
* After a long time of being single on purpose, I'm recently back on the market.

Cons:

* I require intense loyalty and devotion in order to even think about committing. As your girlfriend, I fully intend for you to wake up every day and decide that you're devoted to me, and that our relationship is important to you. I extend you the same courtesy. (This is a con for some men.)
* It's your job to be ""chasing"" me always. This is not meant to be exhausting, but as a long-term, consistent wooing. (Again, not some people's style.)
* Talk to me. Always. I expect constant communication.
* I don't drink or do drugs. (But it doesn't bother me that you do.)
* I've had a interesting, action-filled life. I am complex and larger than life, and so is my family. You will have to deal.
* I've been told I make guys work really hard to get to know me, date me, and keep me. Really hard.
* I expect you to always be willing to pay for things. (Plot Twist: I'm not particularly expensive. I'm a vegan (but not shitty about it), I do a lot of yoga, meditate, go to free local concerts and events...)
* I am a writer. Some people don't like dating those in the arts.

ahazelgun,AskMen,1390464531.0,"Text?  Really?

You want to start strong.  Texting is the opposite of that.  Just picture the following scenarios in your mind.

Scenario A:
You send her a wall of text confessing your feelings.  Maybe she doesn't see it for a few hours.  Maybe even a few days.  Sometimes people leave their phones places.  Sometimes they break them and have to get new ones.  In the meantime, you hyperventilate, pass out, hit the back of your head on a table, and wake from a coma ten years later, thinking, ""Damn, I shouldn't have done that over text.""

Scenario B:
You text her.  She rejects you in a timely fashion.  You are just as crushed as you would have been if you had done it in person, and it will be just as awkward the next time you see her.  The only difference is that she has also lost respect for you as a person, because text?  Really?

Scenario C:
You text her.  She inexplicably reciprocates your feelings even though you texted her.  You now wish you had done this in person because you could see the smile in her eyes, stroke her hair over her ear, and kiss her.  You are now thinking to yourself, ""Damn, I shouldn't have done that over text.""

Is that what you want?

I wouldn't be opposed to the logistical plans being made via text (e.g., dinner at restaurant X at time Y), especially since you guys are already friends and probably do that normally, but I would not be receptive to someone revealing their feelings to me or a desire to ""go steady"" via text.  It just doesn't mean as much as face-to-face interaction, and it also comes across as cowardly.  It is also much, much easier to reject someone over text, because you don't even have to look at them/feel bad, and they just gave you all the reason you'll ever need to do so."

superior22,summonerschool,1390464609.0,"&gt; Once again, I'm unsure on this one in particular, but I feel like BCleaver for an ADC is very situational. ADC mains, correct me if I'm wrong.

You're right. Miss Fortune is basically the only AD who can make proper use of it, if she hits at least 4 opponents with her ultimate and your team members are mostly AD. Each wave of her bullets count as one stack for the Cleaver. If you have a high burst AP champion mid and a tank top, like most games currently, Miss Fortune wants the Last Whisper too.

Black Cleaver has to be stacked, which is already counterproductive for you since you want to kill them as fast as possible. Your target can change multiple times during a fight, having no stacks on the new target and after 4 seconds you lose the stacks on the old target. On top of it a Last Whisper becomes more effective at shredding tanks than a full stacked Cleaver as soon as the target has 100 armor. A Randuin's Omen gives you 70 armor, nine armor seals 12.7 armor and champions like Renekton, Mundo or Shyvana have a base armor of 15 - 18 (+3-4 per level up)"

I live in a 24 unit condo building and we've had intermittent issues ALL the time... basically the internet gets incredibly slow to the point of being unusable for 3-4 hours at a time, sometimes 8-12 hours, and then it just comes back.

This happens anywhere from twice a week to once or twice a month depending on (seemingly) the weather... far less frequent in the spring/fall, it seems.

Every time a tech has come out, they've made up some bogus crap about checking the levels and replacing a splitter down in our electrical room and now it's fixed, presto! but of course nothing actually improves -it's just that the problem was ""fixed"" at the time they showed up so they just waved their hands and left.

To me this led me to believe there was a problem outside of our building, and/or maybe traffic overload since it seemed quite similar to what it was like in the old days when that happened a lot...

**Here's the key part of the question:**

Finally I escalated this repeated issue up, and I finally got a tech supervisor to come out and look, and I was told what I feel is the craziest thing I've ever heard:

I was told that ""feedback"" was coming from 2 of the units in my 24 unit building due to bad connections in those apartments.

""What do you mean bad connections? what can cause that? do they have a defective box sending out noise?""

""No, it may just be they have a loose connection on one of their boxes, and when they turn it on it is wrecking the signal for the whole building""...

so the latest hand-waving BS I got was ""we went into those 2 units and tightened their connections to the wall, and the noise is gone""...

is there seriously any legitimacy to this? can a loosely connected box screw up service for a whole building?"

I'm not sure if it's a cultural difference (I'm in Australia), but people do hold doors for me, store a staff do make eye contact with me, and people do smile at me when we pass in hallways.

I lost a lot of weight and got down to what society would call an 'ideal' physique and peoples behaviour didn't change. Sure, my friends and family were supportive and proud and would congratulate me on my hard work, but there was no shift in how I was treated by strangers.

I've gained a fair bit of weight back, and am comfortable with myself, and people's attitudes towards me are just as they've always been.

I've always tried my hardest to be a kind and good person, and to show interest in others, and for the most part I think it's worked for me.

I sometimes struggle when I read articles such as this. It's just not how I've experienced life as an overweight person. I was never bullied, in fact, I was a 'cool kid' in high school. I'm not trying to gloat or sound smug, I just don't know how to identify with it.

10) I never felt unsafe, and I regularly amble around drunk and solo til 6am without a map to guide me.

11) If you can speak a lick of English, German, French, Russian, or Spanish, every freakin non-Czech in the city will be begging you to explain something or help them with directions, the subway, etc. For some reason, the non-Czech Euros in the city really struggled to understand the place.

Before slavery was abolished and minorities/women had the right to vote, a democrat wanted the people with voting rights to decide. All of those people were white males. The republicans wanted equal representation of all of those people that couldn't vote. Once everyone else could vote, the democrats lost faith in the idea that the voters knew what to do.

&gt; Actually, you invoked ""should"" in your first comment.

It should be within his powers (as ""almighty"" includes all powers) to do it, I never said he should do it.

&gt; Why should I pay you to be my friend?

To take that example. You shouldn't, but it should be within your power to do so (given that you have enough money). Maybe ""would"" would be the better word? ""Would be within his powers""?

&gt; You know I'm Jewish right? Christianity isn't my specialty. But also, why do you need to isolate God like such? God is the was, is, and will be, nothing before and nothing after, and there is none other. Pretty simple framework to work with, no physical manifestations, no need for derivatives. Mathematically, we're working with 1, which is a theme in Judaism, HaShem Echad. (God is One). At that, for Christianity to have any validity, Judaism MUST be valid initially.

I figured you are Jewish, yes. I isolated the Christian god, because I know the more or less official definition of that god (omni-x). But as Jews and Christians believe in the same god, the Jewish one should (or would? ;)) be almighty, too. Isn't he?

If I would just say ""god"" without isolating a single one, then the discussion is impossible, as we could talk about completely different gods with different characteristics and properties. 

&gt; Let me get this straight. There is nothing God can do to prove he is God because anything he does might as well be high tech alien trickery? How would you know it's aliens making you think such a thing if you don't have any confirmation of aliens existing? Might as well say a Leprechaun or magical pony made you believe, but this is just trailing into absurdity.

We don't have any confirmation for any of the entities we're talking about here and we were never in the situation where we had to ask this question. That's why it is a hypothetical question, we assume that there is an entity in front of us who claims to be god and wants to prove it. How can he do it?

An almighty god could do nothing to prove that he is actually an almighty god and not just a very advanced species. Because at some point on the ""power-meter"" we just couldn't see more power. We can't see ""I just created a new universe!"" and as soon as the entity is able to control the human mind, nothing else would matter. Because even if it was *just* a very powerful alien, he could just make us believe he is a god."

lamblikeawolf,AskReddit,1390465377.0,"I cut ties with my dad. I did it because he is an abusive narcissist and will never change.

It didn't take very long for me to move on. I gave him so many chances that by the time I was done, I had already come to terms with the decision.

It's been two years now since I have talked to him.

I had previous stopped talking to him when I was 18 and went to college, giving him an out by saying that I needed to focus on my studies, but that I would reconsider having a relationship with him after I graduated.

Before I graduated, he decided to e-mail me a lot about going to the graduation. I had told him **after**. This is the natural consequence for 18 years of his abusive behavior. He should have been glad I even tried to meet him halfway. He was mad about not being invited.

Then he started emailing me and calling the house every day two weeks after I graduated. (I graduated in December of 2011 - holidays with my 7-years-older sister, who had also just moved back into the house after being in a physically abusive relationship, were very trying. She thinks she knows everything and constantly told me how I should be living my life. Also, she is an alcoholic that I was now suddenly living with, entirely unplanned.) He even pulled a, ""You said you would talk to me after you graduated. I don't appreciate lying, which is what you're doing by not contacting me.""

When I did contact him, I wrote him a letter. I didn't have the courage to talk to him over the phone without breaking down, and a letter feels so much more personal than e-mail. Sure, the letter had an angry tone. But there was reason for the tone to be angry.

He responded in e-mail. He tried to make excuses for all of his behavior. When I told him all the things we could have bonded over, he said ""I never knew you liked those things."" That was the point - he never took the time to know me as anything other than a trophy to make his life seem like a perfect little constructed life. He never treated me as an individual. He blamed being unable to connect with me on being made fun of as a kid. A 50+ year old man said to his 21 year old daughter that he couldn't figure out how to interact with her as a person because 30+ years ago, he was a social outcast. he said we weren't going to get anywhere through e-mail, and urged me to meet him in person somewhere.

I couldn't do that. I would fall apart. If I started crying, it would invalidate anything I had said. On top of the fact that he would steamroller over anything I had to say if he disagreed with it.

When it took me a ""long time"" (a day or two) to respond to this, he told me I was playing mind games with him like my sister and mom did. (Once again, I am not an individual to him.) He said that if there was going to be any more contact, he would no longer initiate. So I never responded.

He randomly sends me messages or things to try to guilt me into talking to him. Like when he sent an email on my birthday that said the day I was born was the happiest day in his life. Or how he gave me (and all of our family) a 1TB external harddrive with all of the family home videos on it for Christmas this past year. Thankfully, he got the message about gift cards pretty quick when I sent it back to him.

Every now and again, my brother, who still talks to him, complains about something new my dad has done. Like the apparently [continuing dog saga.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1fu7ms/i_hate_my_father_he_got_a_dog_today/) (My brother tells me he got another dog recently.)

Obviously, these kinds of things still affect me enough to make me tear myself inside out about them from time to time. But most days I don't think about him. Other people have dads, but their dads don't make me think of my dad. It's like I forget that my dad even exists as a thing.

However, getting to this point took a lot of work. I went to a therapist for about 4 months about it, on top of having a lot of discussions with people who have gone through similar experiences, like the kind folks on /r/raisedbynarcissists . It's like that proverb about a fish that grows up swimming in waste, and doesn't realize that's not normal until it sees unpolluted water for the first time. It was hard to see a lot of the more subtle not-normal behaviors of his until I was far removed from it and could analyze it with some people who had already come through it.

Good luck finding peace with your decision, OP, and everyone else in this thread. Don't be afraid to seek professional help. It is not a weakness any more than going to a doctor for an ear infection is a weakness."

You think a woman would ever do [this?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH6GpXAXmx8) No. That's why when women tell stories everyone is fucking bored because their not about some cool dangerous shit going down, the story is about how cool the woman thinks she is.

**Women fear any loss of social value.** Women never use self deprecating humor or tell you stories about how they fucked up. Women's stories are always white washed where they are the blameless victim. A dood has no problem telling you about the time he got super fucked up, walked in the wrong hotel room and pissed into a sink, interrupting the sex of some rando Asian couple. A woman would never tell that story because she would be too afraid her friends would think shes weird.

Being cool is about taking risks and being uninhibited with the truth, things that women simply don't do."

Based on that, there seem to be a few easy targets in the bunch:

* Creeping Tar Pit. Relatively high in stock but easily a viable target to hit if and when ONS fetches are printed for Modern. 

* Omnath. Somewhat low stock, but deflated in cost by the FTV printing.

* Raging Ravine. Already spiked somewhat, but still a useful manland with plenty of room to grow. 

* Torpor Orb. Modern Sideboard fixture that isn't ""old enough"" to have a pointless spike ala Stoneforge or ""big enough"" to have one like Spelskite

* Praetors. If you don't understand why grab a phone and call the stupid police on yourself.

* Surgical Extraction. Deflated by a buy-a-box promo, but still a safe bet and a Legacy fixture. 

* Sword of War &amp; Peace. The least printed of the new sword cycle and beats out body and mind easily in quality. 

* Batterskull. Modern and Legacy playable. Deflated by a GP promo.

* Havengul Lich. An easy pickup at $2. Casual gold and EDH value. Sadly not legendary though. 

* Huntmaster of the Fells. A possible curve topper for Jund and a solid creature in general. 

* Breaking // Entering. A large mill spell in an unpopular set. We've seen this before. The only thing that might keep this one down is the Game Day promo.

* Deadbridge Chant. 90% of EDH graveyard strategies use BG, and this is a useful, big card for them from an ill-opened set. Two colors restricts its potential value somewhat, but these two colors are quite popular. 

* Progenitor Mimic. Similar story to Deadbridge Chant. Get 'em while they're cheap.

dontlickrocks,PickAnAndroidForMe,1390465790.0,"I was in the market for a new phone a month ago and decided on the Moto X. The Nexus 5, while a great phone at a great unlocked price, was actually not worth it for me since I was just going to renew my AT&amp;T contract anyway and might as well have taken the discount on a new phone. If this is the case for you and you don't *need* an unlocked phone, take the discounted non-Nexus-5 phone. The Moto X and G2 are both really cheap right now if all you're doing is a simple upgrade. 
     
I've been using my Moto X for a week now and have loved every second of it. The phone is smooth and fast, screen looks surprisingly great, battery life is awesome. Motorola also added on a number of useful features that take it from good to amazing. Active Notifications means a part of my screen lights up whenever I take it out of my pocket or pick it up to display the time and notifications, so I don't have to physically turn the screen on. Touchless Controls is like Siri, except you don't need to touch your phone at all to activate it. It's been really useful when I don't have my hands free and I need to make a call or send a text. Or when I'm too lazy to pick up the phone. Camera is activated by a flick of the wrist. Moto Assist automatically reads me my texts while I'm driving and silences my phone when I'm in meetings/class. Moto Connect means I get texts sent to Chrome on my laptop. I got to customize it using Motomaker, so it feels more unique and personalized than other smartphones. As you can see, there's a ton of reasons why I love this phone. The downsides are that the specs are behind the Nexus 5 and G2 and the camera gets hated on, but neither has really affected me at this point. I'm pretty active in /r/MotoX and we see quite a lot of people who have successfully made the switch from iPhones to the Moto X. It's a good crossover phone since it's very user-friendly.
     
The only other phone I'd recommend is the G2, which has a beautiful screen, better specs than the Moto X, and the best battery life out of these three. It also has a knock-on feature where tapping the phone screen wakes it up. I didn't get the G2 myself because I preferred the Moto X's near-stock Android to LG's skin and also the volume and power buttons are on the back, which would annoy me to no end, but it is a beautiful phone nonetheless.

I don't think they are as prevalent as this girl's circle of friends makes it seem.

I can see why this kind of marketing might appeal to high school or even college students who have no idea what the fuck they're doing and are just desperate for any guidance whatsoever, but I would sincerely feel a great deal of pity for any friend who tried to guilt me for not following The Rules.  It just shows a complete lack of understanding of mature, adult relationships.

So no, your dude brain is not missing something.  It sounds like these girls are either in high school, or have not graduated from that mindset as far as relationships go.

If you are, in fact, in high school, then the success is just because they have no idea what they're doing, and the guidance (however misguided) is reassuring."

therefore, all the stuff you did with RES (which is built using Javascript, the only available language to do something like what RES does) is ""forgotten"" by the browser with no good way of remembering it.

junlinu,FinancialCareers,1390467672.0,"1.) Google Investment Banking and you'll get a bunch of online resources. http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com/ is a great start and you can also check Wall Street Oasis. But make sure you're actually interested in the field. There are a lot of competitive business industries: accounting and consulting are equally as competitive to break into but require a lot less of your health. 

2.) That really depends on your location. Ivy Leagues are the obvious choice for IBanking but also consider regional target school. For example USC and UCLA are heavily recruited from the banks in the SoCal area. They don't hold as much weight internationally but are still excellent for their area. 

3.) As mentioned before, start talking to people and depending on your year look around for internships at your school of choice. Visit offices. Ask if you can shadow employees. Be prepared to work for free the first two years. I know a few bulge bracket banks (the large banks i.e. Wells Fargo, Goldman, etc.) have early talent programs for 1/2nd year college students. Prep your college resume for these by grabbing as many internships as early as possible in the finance field. And keep your grades up. I know all this advice is only applicable once you enter college but start preparing now. Think of classes that would fit your interests.

4.) The program seems interesting but my rule of thumb is that if they have to advertise or come to you, the program/school is not worth it. Especially if they're asking you to pay. But make your own judgement on that. 

Feel free to message me if you have any other questions! I'm a junior at USC so I'm pretty deep into the IBanking route."

Can you please tell me how this has endangered national security at all?  

I never said that I trusted Snowden, but he did what whistle-blowers are expected to do.   They get the truth out there, through whatever means necessary.  You can't pretend that he would have been able to report his concerns to his superiors and expected anything to happen other than him losing his job.   The proper channels are all involved in this mess and would never disclose it to the public.   The issues would have never seen a day in the proper court systems that are supposed to keep the balance of power.  

Since when did Russia become a current enemy again?  Snowden is not really holding the government hostage.   The information he has is information that the public has the right to know, and one way or another will be divulged eventually. 

----

I love this country.  I also understand and trust the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   What I don't love is how far our government has strayed from the ideals and the spirit of our country.  How the system that they set up has violated the trust of every American and every country in the world.  How no citizen was given a voice in deciding if every part of our digital lives should be spied upon.  How every citizen is being treated as if they are guilty of conspiring against their own safety without probable cause.  How the government has crafted a system where they can keep secrets that can never be divulged to the public, even if a court requests it.  How the government can label anybody a terrorist, exempt them from due process, and make them disappear.     Hell, even how the government has jeopardized the future of every technology company in America by dissolving all international trust in one fell swoop.    

The US Government has become the biggest threat to the freedom of U.S. Citizens and people in the world.   That's why I don't see people like Snowden as traitors or treasonous villains.  They are people that see a problem with the system that can't easily be addressed, and take whatever action they can to fix it.

&gt;And aren't more likely to know what racism is like?

No? Are there blacks only racism 101 classes that I don't about? I don't really want to get into this because it's touchy and people get offended too easily but all races are racist.

No? Like I said, it's not equivalent to gender rights.

Run with a staff, with a 0,0,0,30,30 build (or as close as possible for your level). Aim for 30 in Water first so you can get Cleansing Water (XI). Then you can drop water fields in the middle of fights, the healing will be small, but the condition removal will potentially help a lot of people and they can always blast it for PBAoE heals.

Be careful dropping your big AOE damage spells in the middle of zerg v zerg fights as you could kill yourself with retaliation. Although this will depend how coordinated the enemy is. 

Use your fields to help your group buff up (Fire for might, lightening of swiftness etc). 

In sieges, use your AOE as area denial. You know you don’t do damage, but the enemy don’t. The big red circles can scare people back.

3 very close friends dominate that game if they're in the same team. 

Two rooms and a boom is a game I could explain it but it's very varying. The basic vanilla game is two teams red and blue. You are dealt a random card and you can choose to share or not share, blues objective is to keep their special carded person (the President) alive and away from reds special carded person(the bomber), and red wants to do the opposite. You need to use all your wiles find out who is on your team, who is the special cards, and work to win. The group is split into two and they're separated, at the end of each round hostages are exchanged through the rooms and you need to get as much info as you can before the end of the game so you can either save your president or blow them up depending on your team. 

The reason I posted about two rooms is simply because new people make the game that much more interesting, you don't know their alliances and they have no reason to mess with you from real world friendships, just a new person to try and work out and play with. "

Illivah,DotA2,1390468213.0,"A hero  who's main skills revolve around increasing visibility control of the map. Give them these 4 skills:  

- create sentry. Creates on target a small creature or something that can crawl and lasts 2 minutes. Said creature can plant itself and act as a normal ward. Increased levels lowers cooldown enough to have multiple creatures. If they never plant as wards, they can attack and move quickly but weakly, or they can be targeted by spells that kill friendly creatures. As wards they'll of course act just like observer wards. 
- Fog area. Creates a zone for ~20 seconds that enemy heroes can not see through unless they are physically inside. They temporarily lose access to wards visibility in this area. Lots of mindfucks could be done with this, and it would combine well with certain stuns. Increased levels can give wider range, longer duration, or shorter cooldowns.  
- Teleport to sentry. Teleports hero to a planted sentry creature. Increased levels make the teleportation animation faster or decrease cooldown.  

ULT - Gives true sight and buffs to team for limited duration. Duration increases with higher levels. With aghs gives true sight and buffs to creature wards as well.

And they would be a ranged hero. There strength in a teamfight would be due to knowledgeable positioning, nullifying their teams usefulness with the fog, protecting against invis heroes and invis ganks,

Starting build would be basic support and survivability stuff (without wards of course). With aghs the ward creatures could become dangerous and worthwhile pushers. With stunning items you could disable a teams ability to cooridinate teamfights really effectively. With invis you could gank really well or help other gank.

A few weeks ago, I decided to pluck my arm hairs. I used really pointy tweezers and plucked about 3/4 of them off in total, in stages on different days. On the plus side, it didn't hurt and I've been able to avoid stubble. I could make it look like I naturally have less arm hair (whereas with waxing it is pretty obvious that you waxed, not that it really matters.) The downside is that it took a lot of time. I just did it while watching TV. It's pretty crazy when I think about it, though. I like the way it looks and feels but I wouldn't recommend it because I have no idea what it will look like in the next few weeks as more of it grows back, and how much of a hassle it will be. If I had an epilator or could wax I would do that instead. If you are young, though I really think you should wait a couple of years before doing anything. You don't want to start something that requires maintenance when it really isn't that big of a deal in the first place.

The old common law on that made sense when you could not prove one way or the other that a man was a father. Then we got blood testing which could exclude a man if the child was not possibly his due to ABO blood typing showing it an impossibility (although it could not CONCLUDE it was his based on this--only exclude) and yet the law didn't budge.

Find out if the combined facts are enough to still love her, and decide if you want to be there for her.

Oh, and the success rate for therapy may be quite low even if she choses to go through with it. Sex addiction isn't a classical addiction, but a symptom of a deeper problem (possibly the abuse trauma, maybe hormones, maybe genetics).

If I had assumed that, ""She invited me to go to a concert with her"" meant ""she wants to date me"" and made a move, I would have gotten unceremoniously rejected. 




Are some men unwilling to gamble that their guess is correct? Yes. That doesn't mean it's not a gamble. Don't be so self involved as to assume that *your* specific signals and motivations are universal.

Feroc,DebateReligion,1390468942.0,"Good, so we're agreeing that the god we're talking about is almighty and that he could chance our minds, if he wanted to. That's a beginning.

&gt; Because God is right in front of you but you just aren't seeing him. God is in the way nature is ordered to work. God is in the way the multiple complexities of your body and how it's functioning at this very moment and not misfiring. If you're looking for God and expecting to see ""The Son"" or an old man in the sky or the flying spaghetti monster, then I can understand your hopelessness and despair, because you'll never find it. God is beyond our physical senses. It's the infinite and our finite minds may think they understand God at times but are only scratching at it and not fully grasping the whole picture because it's just impossible.

That's actually not an answer to the question. How could he prove that he is in fact the god we're talking about right now? You're just claiming that he did things, that's ok, that's your believe. 

The question still is: There is an entity in front of you that claims to be your god. How can he prove it to you? Or maybe it's easier this way: The entity claims he is god, but not the Jewish one, but some other almighty god. How could he prove it?

&gt; I wrote a post recently about why I believe in God using some historical quotes.

Hoodwink,MensRights,1390469829.0,"Young men will pay more in raw costs without subsidies for sure.  Feminists guaranteed this.  But there were others involved as well, namely the health insurance industry realizing that they would have a crisis because of the boomers that could lead to single-payer.  They would have to get more money in that didn't come from their customer-base, somehow.  Enter young men (and some, but fewer women), medical device companies, tanning salon taxes, and a host of other taxes namely to enforce compliance.

&gt; costs a greater share of young mens total income as these earn less

Yes.  Subsidies and the plethora of plans based on geography screw any hard facts and analysis up, and it doesn't help that males pay more for car insurance and are the ones paying for dates, the tab, status symbols, etc.  Men, in general, are sexually chosen as mates partly on their incomes and there is a lot of men who choose to forgo health insurance rather than nights out.  Men, in general, have to spend more money for a social life, hobbies, and entrepreneurship.  So health insurance, when optional, is going to be down on the list.  It's actually a healthy prioritization if you think about life and the risks/rewards.

But, in general, young men's income has declined over the decades, and a young woman who puts in comparable effort into a job actual earns more than a young man in the city (and this is in excess of 10% and can be as high as 30% more).  So, what you have is a bunch of lower middle-class income men subsidizing a young, higher middle-class income women.  The subsidies might screw with this a bit and the chosen insurance plans and geography will generally make any hard analysis be hand-wavy and confused.  But the general direction of transfer payments seems to depend on young men (and politically unconnected industries) to females, old, and health insurance industry."

mundabit,bigboobproblems,1390469892.0,"Birth control can start causing side effects the same day to take your first pill, ""3 months"" is how long it takes for side effects to start levelling out and you get an idea of which ones you are stuck with and which ones will fade away.

Sometimes breasts develop later in puberty too. You can get your breast buds, then get your period then a few years later your breasts can grow again. That's what happened to me, I got my buds around 9-10 (I got my period at 9) and at 13, a 38C I thought I was done, at 18 I was a 34G. I'm now a 34F after coming off my pill.

have a look at /r/ABraThatFits to get an idea of sister sizes so you can hopefully find a bra that will work when 32E's aren;t ins tock. and /r/braswap can help you get rid of your old ones and maybe get some new ones.

After 3 months on your birth control your breast size will start to settle and stop changing, But remember that your cycle can cause breasts to swell, so you may find that even after theys top growing you need two bra's a 32E for most weeks and a 32F for ""period boobs"" "

That means that even France, Britian, and Germany cannot launch a offensive campaign against Russian. Their military are stuck in their home countries.

The immobility of Europe's military and lack of logistical power making it so Russian can just slowly erode their strenght and creep into Europe.

bubbish,AskMen,1390470344.0,"I'm going to take a jab at what seems to be the popular opinion here; ""just say it"". I don't think it's helpful.

It's easy to give this advice but I think it's partly wishful thinking by guys. In real life, the complications are endless, especially in situations OP describes (group settings, not-sure-if-date settings). There's simply too much risk involved in outing yourself like that and us guys should know this all too well. It only works in movies. The only time it'll work in real life is when both parties are very sure of their respective interest levels, which is very rare.

I can only answer OP's questions by alluding to my own experience. A green light is often sorely needed but it can (and does) show up subtly because girls are masters of subtle signs. It can be in a lingering touch, a well-timed compliment, a willingness to follow the guy's suggestions etc.

I'll try to give you a few concrete ways but I'll disclaim that I'm never comfortable quantifying this kind of social behavior. Real life just involves too many variables and unknowns.

* Greet him big and obvious, with smiles and hugs. This is especially nice in group settings, like when he shows up in the bar and you're already there with your friends. This one girl simply hugged me longer and more often than anyone else - that was enough for me.
* Be positive to his suggestions. If he wants to go out with you, just say yes and sort of ""absorb"" the plans. Make yourself part of what he wants to do.
* Take every opportunity to be alone with him, even if it's just a cigarette on the balcony.
* This one is kind of childish but it has worked on me - make it obvious for him that you're talking about him with your lady friends. Giggle about him a little bit. It's cute but it might not work on every guy.
* Uhm, what else... Oh yeah, when the opportunity presents itself, just fucking take him. Grab him by the collar or tie and just smooch. There's nothing sexier than a gal who knows what she wants and goes for it. Seriously."

myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1390470611.0,"Some things you should know: virginity is a made up social construct that is simply baggage from the old days where sex was much more dangerous, especially for women. These days, it has no value, and never has it been the case that having sex will change who you are. You are going to feel no different before and after you ""lose your virginity"". 

That being said, there is nothing wrong with pursuing sex if you want it. As others have said, put yourself together. Dress in well fitting clothes (stay away from graphic tees probably, 25 is a little old for them), groom yourself, smell nice. The internet is your friend, especially since you seem pretty introverted. If you're truly just looking for a hookup, get Tinder. If you're actually looking for a relationship, keep it up with online dating, OKCupid is pretty good. With both of these, don't just wait for someone to get ahold of you, reach out to people you are interested in, and be ready for rejection. Not everyone is going to be interested, and that's ok, not everyone has to be. Someone will. 

If you do start a relationship, be careful not to put her on a pedestal. Be there. Be present in the relationship. A lot of the time guys who are new to relationships will either come off as a worshiper or as a needy emotional sponge, so just remember that she's a person. That being said, first time relationships can be messy (hell, 100th time relationships can be messy) so be emotionally prepared for it to not work out."
zeppelinfan182,Guitar,1390470614.0,"When I was in 6th grade I happened upon a mix CD with what I believed to be pop songs on it. For the most part I was right, with one glaring outlier.

Up until this point I only knew of Metallica as a ""radio"" rock band who played Enter Sandman. I had no idea about their history and in my ""punk rock"" mind I had no desire to research otherwise.

Well, that mix CD had Whiplash from Kill 'Em All on it. I had never heard anything so furious, technical, and fast. That was the moment that I realized that the guitar hobby that I had been picking up for about 6 months was going to be something a little more serious.

Kirk's solo, while not the most expressive or technical solo by far (even for him!), will always be special to me because every time I hear it I can go back to being a 12 year old kid rediscovering my passion and love for music. If ever I'm questioning my direction or my determination to make it in the music industry, one play of that song on shuffle when I'm not expecting it will almost always bring me right back."

Kitmosaurus,childfree,1390470704.0,"Counting is a helpful way to let the child know he has [x]-amount of seconds to start behaving in the way I want. When I count, I make sure the kid does what I want otherwise shit will hit the fan. Example, we had a 'time-out' chair in the daytime therapy group where I used to work. When a kid was being a jerk I told him to sit on the chair. When he refused, I told him I want him on that chair in 5 seconds. If he wasn't, I told him I would 'help him sit on the chair' and (for example) forbid him to play soccer that day: 1...2...3...4...5... Most of the time they listened. When they wouldn't, I would place them on that chair myself and they would be punished later for not listening. If used correctly, it gives the child a choice (to listen or to be punished) and think about the consequences of his behaviour. Counting is utterly useless when the consequences are not there."

You're not even able to talk about a hypothetical scenario. 

&gt; Find me one other culture that was twice expelled from its land, has returned twice, and survived a 2000 year diaspora in which it retained its identity and heritage.

Not needed, there was one, prove enough that it is possible. Just because something is unlikely doesn't mean that it's impossible or needs a god to be possible.

There is no need in a further discussion with you. A hypothetical scenario requires someone to be able to deal with the assumptions of the scenario. That's like asking ""Imagine you can fly, what would you do?"" and you answer: ""Flying is impossible!""

Missed this post...This is the worst case scenario dude... You are like the poster child for guys that are usually cheated upon.  You sound  like an absolute doormat... You are not a partner, you are a maid. And the worst thing is, you are proud of being. Dumbass!! 

Does she work ? Can you tell your about what both of you do ? How much money do you guys make ? 

You are an enabler of the highest degree. You enable her in her slefish behavior. Your first thought to improve the marriage is  ""to do even more things to please her"" is absolutely wrong. Behavior of pleasers like you is a pattern that is repeatedly observed to fail when you are dealing with a selfish spouse. It is called ""Plan A"" in the marriage material books.

What about sex life ? Do you have one ? Is it bad (I'm guessing it is)


Like I mentioned in the previous post, red the Married man sex life primer and No more Mr.Nice guy. Read those books. Don't tell about them to your wife.

GrandBuba,short,1390471668.0,"&gt; Ok I just asked *one*

And people tell me I'm too anecdotical :-)

But as you say, it's indeed a personal experience. *My* taller friends are doing the exact same thing. They all say they'd like to date a tall girl, but they go home with a short one, because that short girl pursued them more aggressively and had less visible *strings attached*.

Allow me to expand on the 'less strings attached' part:

I'm friends with a lot of tall women. Being a) short and b) taken makes me the de-facto 'gay confessional friend' for a lot of them. I get a lot of very *honest* things from them :-)

The standard reaction most short girls have towards a tall good-looking man is a very valid ""I'ma gonna tap that"", and that works flawless with most men. 

On the other hand, the standard reaction those tall girls in our circle have to that same man is ""/swoon, he must be the one, my prince charming, he's like, also *tall*, you know.."". They play the 'come hither'-game, become flustered around him, think the guy is feeling the same 'magical connection' because she's also tall etc..

Guys pick up on that, weigh their options (starry-eyed tall girl wanting to marry them on the spot or short girl who's merely humping their leg).

They usually go with option number two, because at the bar, at night, that's what they're were there for...

Rikkety,AskReddit,1390472281.0,"I think an anonymous marketplace like Silk Road is a great concept when it comes to recreational drugs: people want to use them, and as they're not hurting anyone else that's fine with me.
Getting your drugs from a place like Silk Road seems a lot safer to me than getting them from some random street dealer. 

As for Mr. Ullbricht himself: I think he's closer to a villain than a hero. Not because he founded Silk Road, but because of how he dealt with it.
He became careless, using traceable acounts for Silk Road business and eventually allowed himself to be blackmailed. The way he dealt with this was to hire someone to kill said blackmailer. Twice.
That's not heroic behavior. Now he's not been convicted yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty bad. 

He was also running Silk Road from the US; both he and the servers were where they are most vulnerable. This seems pretty careless to me. The guy had millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and could have easily moved abroad where he'd be much harder to catch and prosecute.

I don't think he's stupid or evil, but I think maybe he developed some delusions of grandeur, or at least became overconfident that he could not be touched, which led to his downfall."

Compare her behavior with other people. If she's flirty with everyone, you know that's her normal state. If she's not, lucky you.

I don't mean to sound belittling but it's not so hard as guys in this sub mark it out to be. Sure, at first it's nearly impossible to tell what a girl is trying to convey but after spending some time with her, you can work out what she's trying to say with her subtle signs and body language.

Of course, an insecure mind always has this little voice that goes ""she's not interested, who the fuck would like you?"" or ""don't act on it man, you'll just embarrass yourself because girls just aren't overtly interested in you"". 

This is why it's so important, as a guy, to work on getting more self confident. Insecurities are like a mist, veiling the true messages conveyed by girls around you. Self confidence might at times require deluding yourself (""I'm the hottest guy here! All girls want me!"") but at the same time it's helpful in seeing past all the social complexities and realizing that a girl likes you."

pistashley_O,TwoXChromosomes,1390474023.0,"It's four-thirty AM where I live, and I just had a pretty serious panic attack. I handled it erratically... but I handled it. I got shaky and was crying a little, and my sweet little dog became nervous and went to my Dad's room downstairs, looking for his Pa-pah (as my Dad so aptly named himself after my adopting my little dog.)     
And I started to loose it for a second, at my Dads not being there. But instead of curling into a ball I went in, and why-ever it helped, I started to clean. I took all of his sheets off and put them in the wash (again, at three AM then... my poor brother hopefully slept through that noise!) and then dusted the room, the tv and headboard. Then I swept, behind all of the furniture and under the bed, and then organized and folded neatly the pile of clothes on the chest. I cleared and folded the blankets with shaking hands, and put them in the closet along with an old sculpture of mine he'd kept propped by the door.     
I replaced an ugly old painting on the wall with a prettier, blue-er one he had sitting by the window, and found an even better one to hang above the bed (once I can use a hammer without disturbing the house.) I threw out his dip-cup that the doctor's tabooed, and straightened the chords around his night stand.    

I didn't mention above how terrified and shaken I am - possibly because I've adopted a strange mechanic reaction, hardening my emotions in lieu of logistic, productive actions. I cried for just a minute on the phone as my brother explained the situation, then spent a long three hours driving in the dark and locking my feelings somewhere where they couldn't fog my eyes while I watched the road, or crack my voice as I calmed my sister. I put the reaction in a place where it couldn't interfere with what my family needed, and it wasn't until now, when everyone is asleep and safe and I'm alone and awake that I let it go.    
And so I cleaned. I cleaned until I wore myself out, and the dryer just beeped that the sheets are fresh - I can re apply them, breath deep, and lay my head down for the next two hours until I wake to shower and drive back to the ICU.    
I may be tired tomorrow, but I released something tonight, some volatile teary-emotion that found it's rightful place in my quiet solitude - because tomorrow I'll be strong and comfort my daddy, my sister, my mom, and my brother. I'm ready for it now.    
And the sheets are cleaned."

He had been linked with City all through the window.  All day on sky on deadline day we were watching and waiting for him to move to city.  Mark Hughes was expecting it.  Only at Manchester airport he was met by Man Utd and taken to Old Trafford.  Sky told Hughes this on camera while he was on the golf course.  

United kept him there all afternoon and at first Tottenham were furious.  They had agreed everything with City.  United paid more than that and injected a gagging clause meaning Spurs couldn't talk about what happened.  Near midnight as the window was closing, Berbatov was a Utd player.

Maybe it's because it gave the devision it's own exclusive match, maybe it's because it guaranteed that the two Divas in question had to have some resemblance of a storyline to justify what's going on, or maybe it's just because it treated the divas division as an attraction, rather than an extra, but WWE really needs to reinvent the devision along these lines, If they want to get the most out of the talent they currently have available."

AceroInoxidable,TheRedPill,1390475236.0,"This. A thousand times. My last LTR told me her story about being sexually forced when she was 14 years old. She did it the first night we spent together and I just told her, using kind words, that that was bullshit. And, because I was developing feelings for her, I explained to her why did I think it was bullshit.

I used to read girl's palm in order to nail them, ""reading"" their past and telling them very profound things about their psyche. One of the things that I ALWAYS included in my ""reading"" was this one:
&gt; When you were younger, maybe a kid or a teenager, someone forced you to act as an adult when you weren't ready for it (pause). Yes, I know it was hard (long pause) but you have to think that everything that have happened to you made you what you're know, and if you like yourself you can thank that event for making you who you are.

I must have ""read"" those lines like to a thousand girls and the vast majority of them could relate to them.

I now think that having a sexual encounter too early (or what they think was sexual even if it wasn't really sex) is something very common to women and most of them doesn't give a shit about it, nor it affects their emotional and sexual life.

If you find a woman who put forward this argument when she needs it, either she's a manipulative bitch or her brain doesn't work properly. Either way, distance yourself from her.

Or, if you too like to live dangerously, call her bullshit and keep her around you. That's what I did with my last LTR, and I'm still trying to decide if it was worth it: yes, that kind of move from my side made her my girlfriend, but there's a reason why she's now my ex."

You'll need to tell us where you're from and what part of the U.S. you're in now for specific advice.

As for general advice, I lived abroad for two years, and you're going to have to prepare yourself for those moments when everyone else in the room thinks you're crazy, and all you can do is secretly think that they're the ones that are crazy.  This will happen, perhaps often, depending on how different your culture is.

Still, everywhere in the world, there are people who will understand you, even though they come from a different background.  You just need to find those people, and hopefully they can explain things to you.  You may never agree with the American way of life, but it helps with the alienation if you can at least understand it.  You can try connecting with people on couchsurfing.org.  It's primarily for people who need a place to stay, but it's generally great for connecting with people who are well travelled and are very receptive to people of different backgrounds.

Also, keep an open mind.  You may find that American customs or values that seem completely off-putting to you now may force you to reflect on why your own values are important to you, and if they should be held in such high esteem.  You may find that in a year or two, they don't seem so weird, or you might even like them.  The cool part is you kind of get to cherry pick between both cultures and live by a mix of values that you really believe in, not only because you grew up that way, but because they've been challenged and you've stuck by them.

This is all probably only going to happen if your ""quite a while"" is at least a year, though.  If you're here for a significantly shorter time period, make friends and all that, but the experience is probably not going to rock your world view.  It might be enough time to observe, but not enough time to accept.

All that being said, cultural adjustment is extremely exhausting.  Humor is very difficult to grasp or create in a second language, and it can make for a lot of awkward situations.  Try to get a handle on topics that are taboo as soon as possible so you know to avoid them.  (For example, weight and salary are generally not discussed in the States.)  Stay in touch with a good friend from back home to whom you can rant about the weird things we do here, but also ask an American friend about it, so you know why they're happening.

Apologies for length, but feel free to PM me with more details about your situation if you want more specific advice."

They do this by making the means of death somewhat indirect, the needles do it or the chair does it. The other bit is that witnesses shouldn't endure anything too gory but the chair is already pretty damn gory. If we're going to kill people, couldn't we just ""design a machine"" to put a round or two in their head? Remotely operated firearms are already a thing.

All that we should care about, is what it looks like in the end - if 1080p means we get a better looking game - then awesome, however if it makes sense to sacrifice resources and upscale it from a lower resolution, or spend time in development elsewhere - then that's something the developers should be deciding from a purely aesthetic point of view.

The whole video is satire. The average person won't know what they're talking about when talking about cameras. He's making fun the people who wrote angry replies. He said it was something hipsters would buy, an opinion that's based off their fashion sense. They were offended that he would be so rude to judge based on appearance and so he stepped into their shoes. And in the end, what did he find out?

People will make judgement based on appearance, including hipsters themselves (and in their case some crazy assumptions). They judge the look of clothing and the camera and make judgement based on that alone. The black camera is for perverts and the metal one is for family. Not much different from saying the black one is professional and the metal on is for hipsters. 

He has nothing against the camera. This was never really about the camera. He even said that he likes the camera. It looks good and it takes good pictures. He was basically making fun of ""hipsters"" because he was right and they got offended that he said it."

**How the fuck did this happen?** The Euromaiden protests were originally pro-EU protests and were completely peaceful. However, the current revolt broke out when the government responded by passing incredibly repressive anti-protest and anti-free-speech laws. These included penalties of 15 years in prison for attending a protest.
Who are the Berkut? The Ukranian traitorous special police/force.

**What are Titushkas?** Government thugs hired to cause damage and give the protests a bad image as well giving the government justification to use increasingly forceful and violent measures to suppress the activists.

Berean_Katz,AskReddit,1390476853.0,"It kinda depends on the reason. If it was some crazy virus, then me surviving probably means that I'm immune. If that's the case, then there are probably other people with the same good fortune as me. I'd make every attempt in finding them so we can start humanity over. 

Here's how society would be rebuilt:

Throughout my journey, I would study human history (free books!) and learn what actions to take to form a successful civilization (I'm sure democracy would be a good way to start). If the world is left the way it is in its present state, then we could take the leftover technology and build a pretty decent society complete with clean, hot water; plumbing; and air conditioning. Being a mechanic/engineer would be a definite plus, now that I think about it.

New York City would be an amazing playground for us. We'd have street races all across Broadway--after we cleared out all the leftover cars, of course. Speaking of which, it's gonna suck having to clear out all the bodies. What a shame. Paintball games would cheer us up. Real life Call of Duty/Battlefield, complete with our own urban arena.

Free condoms gallore. Screw baseball, Sex would be our national pastime, considering how valuable (and entertaining) it is to our well-being. Repopulating the earth would become part of our culture. You might even say sex would be a cultural cornerstone. We'd have to teach our kids Sex-ed, though, of course. Hopefully our viral immunity passes on to our offspring. If not, we'd have to figure out a cure or something. That would be shitty, but totally worth it.

Guns, guns, guns. Totally necessary for all of us to know how to use a gun. It would be another cultural cornerstone. Who knows what other immune people are out there? There could be a whole gang of Mad Max-ian psychos out there ready to try and rape our women and steal our shit. We'd have laws, of course. We'd teach our children how to handle the guns properly, and only use them for hunting and self-defense. You might think it's risky, but it really depends on how you go about forming your society and establishing your laws. Hence the whole ""studying human history"" idea.

Sports would be another part of our culture. Hunting would be very popular, obviously. I'd push to make hockey popular for my group, because Hockey's the shit. Also, imagine how fun rollerblading, skating, or BMX-ing through an open city would be? Fuck yes. Why such an importance on sports, you ask? Because I understand the power they have. It gives us joy, hope, good health, and comradery. All important for a society to flourish. What society *doesn't* like sports? Exactly.
___
This is all assuming that I'm not the only survivor, though. If not, then I'd pretty much treat the world as my own playground, like anyone else. I wouldn't have sex with dead people, though, unlike some of you *other* dudes. Scoundrels, the lot of you.

ahazelgun,AskReddit,1390476881.0,"Being ripped off by a cab driver in Istanbul.  Common practice all around the world, obviously, but something about this guy just really pissed me off.  I think it's because I called him out on it since I knew the price was wrong, and he still insisted that his price was the right one, pointing to his ""meter"" that had completely nonsensical numbers on it.  I'm also mad at myself, because I ended up just paying it rather than wasting my time arguing with him, and then I was just mad about it the whole day, which obviously detracted from the experience.  It had also never happened to me in the 20+ countries I had previously been to, of varying degrees of economic development, so this really was a unique experience to me that I still associate with Turkey, simply because it happened there.

It generally bothers me when dishonest people don't realize that they are leaving an impression not just of themselves but of their country and their culture.  If someone asks me about a country I've never been to, but I once met some guy from there who said this thing one time, that's all I have.  That's my *only* impression of that entire country and culture.  And obviously I know he may not be statistically representative, but he is literally representative, in my mind, because I have nothing to counter it.

So do I think all Turks or even all Turkish cab drivers are liars and cheats?  Obviously not.  I actually think Turks, generally, are extremely warm and will go out of their way to help you with no expectation of anything in return.  But it was a terrible first impression, and it did affect the way I interacted with other cab drivers, because I was much more guarded and defensive.  (Based on my subsequent experience in Istanbul, this was not unwarranted.  A much, much larger percentage of the Istanbul drivers try to rip you off by charging at least double the fare if not several times more, than any other city I've been to.)"

So basically in recent history Poles get killed a lot.

Also I know that when the West German Luftwaffe inherited the planes from East Germany they eventually donated their fancy MIG or SU (forget which) fighters to the Polish air force.

He needs to be more specific with you. Ask him to be more specific. If he doesn't know how to be more specific, that's not your problem. 

1. Some guys masturbate a lot and cannot finish from oral sex. And some guys, regardless of fapping habits, can never finish from oral sex. This is not your problem either, but ask for specific suggestions anyway and try them. 
2. Keep a glass of water nearby to make sure your mouth is wet. A dry mouth is like having sex with a blanket. 
3. Guys vary a lot about what they want. Some want choking sounds, some don't. Some want moaning (the vibrations feel great), some don't. Some want you to go fast, some want it slow. 
Ask him. 
4. Don't focus on one part for too long. The constant rubbing can start to hurt. 
5. Act like you want him. Give him  a sexy smile to start things off and say ""I want you in my mouth"" and just start rubbing him.

Now, if you worked in the Medical field at all, then you would know that the patient is his own worst enemy. This guy, who is saying he thinks he has anxiety driven pre/hypertension, could ACTUALLY have Hypertension or any number of a the Cardiovascular issues that there are today. YOU NEVER TAKE WHAT THE PT STATES FOR FACE VALUE. If this guy was to use ANY Rx to get him to ""chill out"" before the office visit (Valium is abused at lot for things like this) and was shown normal BP range, and then 4 wks later, he has an Infarction because he lied about it, you'd feel pretty terrible huh? You probably thing im going over kill, but im doing what any medical professional would. The way you go about this is, TREAT THE ANXIETY, THEN TAKE THE BP WHEN STABLE. That is how you are SUPPOSE to do it. Do Medics do all sorts of shady stuff? You bet your ass we do.

tattedspyder,Gaming4Gamers,1390478291.0,"I'm an amateur voice actor and I've done work for a couple of games, I can shed a little light on this.

For a lot of games the voice actors don't actually record their lines together.  Many are actually recorded from home or from studios all over the world and then sent to the producer.  For the better games they naturally use better actors, better studios, and make every effort to record the dialogue with the actors actually conversing, but a lot of this stuff is still done pretty cheaply.

At that point it's really on whoever is editing the audio and programming the game to make the interruptions and conversations sound more natural.  If the person editing the voice track left a bit of silence before the dialogue then when the game accesses that audio file you'll get a pause before the line.  Similarly if the editor trims the track correctly but the programmer doesn't time the file access right you'll get a pause.

So basically what I'm saying is that it isn't the actors' fault usually.

2) Yes, and setting up trades favorably is the best way to get ahead. If they're leading with elite infantry, for example, you can expose a third of a cheap unit of tarpit infantry to bait them into a charge, then wipe out their whole unit on the following turn.

3) Pretty often. Not every game, but a well-timed throw, trample, or slam can end a game. A lot of factions have a warjack with an ability called Chain Attack: Grab+Smash that allows for a free power attack in the course of regular attacks which most people get a lot of mileage out of. A lot of people forget about these power attacks, and you'll win a lot more games if you remember that they are options.

4) This depends almost entirely on the caster or warlock I'm playing. I have some lists that are outright dedicated to  going straight for the kill, some lists that have the option to assassinate if my opponent exposes themselves built in, and more conventional attrition lists designed to outlast my opponent. Sometimes dominating the field anyway (especially for scenario) to draw out the opposing caster is the proper way to get an assassination to go off, so it's rarely one or the other entirely.

5) Thankfully this isn't 40k/WHFB - I've yet to play a faction where Warcaster X/Warlock Y was straight up not viable. A lot of whining on the internet might tell you that one sucks, but what that really means is that you have to structure a force very particularly to get them to perform the best. There are a couple warjacks or units in each faction that are borderline unusable, though. The thing about warmahordes too is that while it's simple to get an on-paper feel for most casters' abilities, the length of games combined with the fact that most people only play a couple times a week tops means that there will always be interactions that surprise you."

Basically, all of this is rage over how you couldn't play online with your friend - it got old because you couldn't play with your friend. Had your friend simply bought the harddrive, you'd probably agree it was at least mildly fun for about 15-20 hours with a buddy.

He has *still* shown you that he is wilfully ignorant, believes that a group of people don't deserve the same rights as you do, and thinks sexual identities are somehow created by ingesting substances. Does he think coke makes you trans*? Perhaps pot makes you bi? Sigh. 

Then we can move on to the reality. You have gay friends, care about gay rights, and might one day pop out a gay kid or two. This is not a person that should be around them. My ex was a homophobe and I didn't realise until he met one of my good friends and was ridiculously uncomfortable, not to mention surprised that he knew how to put together an IKEA flatpack. No, I'm not kidding. That relationship didn't last long. It's a dealbreaker, and your SO is a bigot. If he was racist and hated anyone who wasn't the same ethnicity as him, would you put up with it? Nope. 

There may be some hope here that he'll change his views, but he's been with you, a person who is pro gay rights and has gay friends, for *seven years* and hasn't changed. So it doesn't bode well I'm afraid, hun. Sorry.

tilsitforthenommage,Warhammer40k,1390479161.0,"I see it more along the lines a semi submersible. Imagine this if you will:

The waves lapped along the equatorial shoreline. Torvial squinted against the sun and surveyed the beach fortifications once more; the remnants of the traitor forces had retreated to this warp-touched lost island for a last stand, the rebellion having been shattered abruptly by the arrival of a space marine detachment.  

It was a classic, time-honoured layout for resisting any naval attacks. Sea mines bobbed around breakers, the remaining heavy artillery had been trained just beyond them, captured Hydra units kept the skies clear and the kill zones of heavy stubbers and bolters could easily mop up troopers who made it to the sand. 

Hopefully, they could buy enough time for the summoning ritual to finish so they could take as many loyalists as they could along with them screaming into the warp. 

Cries of alarm and the peal of sirens split the air - a formation of Rhino troop carriers supported by Land Raiders burst out of the water and were already on the beach, demolishing the fortifications with heavy ordnance before the defenders had any chance to return fire. 

Torvial panicked, they couldn't possibly resist heavy armour this close; the artillery would take too long to adjust to such a close range and there was no other anti-armour to deploy. He couldn't have imagined submersible vehicles existed, they were completely defenceless against this assault. 

His thoughts turned to the summoners in the hatch and if they could possibly have succeeded in their dreaded ritual. Suddenly his view of the beach became blocked by the blue chest plate of power armour. He was dimly aware of drawing his laspistol but then it flew away along with his arm and a fist the size of his head thundered into his face, taking away his worries and his life.

We know that we have a generation of babyboomers who are retiring en masse in the next decade. Ten years later, a ton of them will try to sell their house. That means the deflation is at least a decade or even two away. 

At least, that's my two cents. 

I seriously wonder if a house is a good investment. You typically have to pay twice in mortgages what you would pay in rent. That means that if your mortgage lasts 25 years, you could use that same amount to rent for 50 years. Sure, you end up with your own house and the appreciation value... If you live that long. 

It also ties you down considerably. You can't lose your job, a divorce almost always means you have to sell the house,...

But as long as everyone believes a house is a good investment, it will continue to be a good investment since you'll always be able to sell it. "

By your logic, I shouldn't apply that thinking in a career or making the Dean's list at a university.  Quite honestly, that's called lack of effort. In the work environment, that sinks the work effort.  It's a TEAM based game.  Just like any other situation.  Cooperate and learn, or get out and play a non competitive game/single player game.

Losing is fine when it's an even.  If I'm having a poor game, evaluate the mistakes.  But it's complete bull when 3 or 4 others feel like playing single player.  That's the difference between intense, fun matches and one sided matches.

ANewMachine615,DepthHub,1390480064.0,"Yeah, definitely. Sorry that I didn't contextualize this properly -- I thought it was another discussion I've been having about the link between the modern world and Tolkien's legendarium. But yeah, originally there was neither Sun nor Moon, and both are actually vessels for the last fruit of two holy trees that provided the majority of light in Arda, but were destroyed by Melkor (basically Satan). The world was flat before Men rebelled against the Valar and God intervened to make it a globe (to prevent Men from reaching the Uttermost West where the Valar lived). That sort of thing.

Tolkien thought that these conflicted too much with known science of the development of the solar system (Sun predating Earth, Moon predating all life, never being a flat Earth, etc.) and wanted to change it. IMO it would've been awful -- basically transforming a mythical setting into mere history plus symbolism."

Celidos,AskWomen,1390480100.0,"It does! On a smaller scale, I can use my previous jobs as an example. First I started in the building as a cashier. Hours were bad, pay was bad, normal food court stuff. However, I made friends with another guy who got hired around the same time as I did, and when the semester ended and our hours got cut down by a lot, he moved downstairs to janitorial (which pays a lot more with regular hours). He had gotten to know the janitorial supervisor from his shifts and was guaranteed the job. When he found out they were looking for a lady to work weekends, he immediately called me up, and I had a short, informal interview with the supervisor. Weekends as a janitor on a college campus are super easy, I'd spend 2 hours doing work, and then 6 hours waiting for someone to fuck up. That gave me the free time to get to know the people in all the departments. This past month, I put in my app for hotel operator since it gave me time to do homework and other work stuff, and I had a very short interview with the manager, since I got along well with everyone who worked there, knew the building and half the people in it, and had gotten to know him  over the past 6 months.

I love the components and the magical world theme is present enough, but I'm not very keen on the gameplay itself... which may be due to only having played it as a two-player.

Mostly where I find the game gets a bit janky is with the cards. I feel like there are some cards that are pretty overpowered and unbalanced, and a lot of cards that just do flakey things. Without grabbing the game box to refresh my memory (it's been a while since I've played it) I can't really give you more than a vague impression on the cards, but my impression was that they weren't designed very well, unlike the rest of the game - which seems extremely solid.

Again, this could be due to my having played it strictly as a two-player game. Perhaps the expansion solves this, but I really doubt it. "

There is one story I don't have enough opportunity to tell, so I'm going to tell it properly this time. It's a sappy one, so brace yourself. It's about how my dad is one of my favourite human beings in the world.  

My mom and my dad just were not meant to be together. My mother was a virtuoso opera singer with bursaries and sponsorships just rolling at her feet when she left university. All of her peers and classmates went on to do ridiculously well both locally (South Africa) and internationally. She chose otherwise.  
She decided to give up a chance to study further in Germany and settle down. She wanted a husband and children, and she wanted them yesterday. The pressure of being this musical genius growing up left her so lonely I think, she just set her sights on the first guy and said, ""Right. I'll have you and your impossibly tall babies.""   
The guy she chose was my dad. He was tall and not terribly good-looking or smart, but he was for damn-sure one of the best people she had ever met, and he was caring to a fault. They tried so hard to get pregnant, but after a few years of trying, they decided to go the IVF route. Because of all the tests the both of them had to undergo for the procedure, they learned that my tall dad had something called Klinefelter Syndrome, which effectively rendered him sterile. They went with the option of using donor sperm, and after another roadblock in the form of a miscarriage, they had me. Apparently my dad followed me all the way from the delivery room to the baby ward just to make sure they didn't switch me with anyone else's baby. Years later, after they had divorced and so many mental and emotional issues burned holes through even their chance at friendship, I helped my dad come out of closet and now he's getting married to an awesome man I adore.  

Honestly, it's like the universe was doing everything it possibly could to throw signs up, letting my mom know that this was the wrong relationship; the wrong path. So desperate to have the nuclear family with children and escape the pressure of being this genius, she married a gay man who couldn't have children- and even after they took alternative routes there was a miscarriage.  

My point is, my dad got shanghai'ed into a situation where he suddenly found himself the patriarch of these children in a loveless marriage to a (frankly) mentally unstable woman. He could have bolted. He could have just done the bare minimum, been there. But there's one memory I cling to that just serves as the example of how amazing a father he was to a child he had no obligation to love.  

When Titanic came out, I was 8. I was also obsessed. Leo was my first proper movie-star crush, and I was in agony at the thought of how far away he was, how much older. And I threw a full-on tantrum at the end of the movie watching it the first time, because not only did my Leo die, that bitch let him go! If posters had been readily available, I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to see my wall for Leo's face.  
But that kind of stuff was scant, not only because we seem to live at the arse end of the world where the current century only struggles by eventually, but we weren't exactly well off either.  
Howtheveryever. I came home from school one day, and my lovely dad was smiling like he had swallowed a hanger. He had his arms behind his back, and told me a little fiction about how he had written to Leo (I think he tried, but realised that, the internet being in its infancy, it wasn't going to be that easy) and told Leo about a little girl called Elle. Leo had apparently sent back some autographed pictures (tech savvy, IT technician dad had managed to find signed pictures online and printed them out for me), but the crowning jewel was this magazine my dad had ordered all the way from America through proto-Amazon.  
It was called Lovin' Leo, and it was literally just stories and pictures about him, his home life, his movies, likes and dislikes... I read that thing so many times. I filled in the quiz to see how compatible I'd be with Leo. It was a gift born entirely out of my dad noticing that there was this one thing I loved so much, and out of his own initiative, for no special occasion other than wanting to see me happy, he went out and searched for something he could give to make that happen. It was the most thoughtful, spontaneous gift I've ever received, and even after my Leo-mania settled into a more tempered admiration for an incredible actor who happens to be easy on the eye, I kept that magazine.  
Actually, one of my friends in primary school lost it, but about 6 years ago I found a single copy at a huge book sale, and bought it. I don't need to read about how Leonardo thought Critters 3 was a crapshoot or how he loved milk with ice, I just love having a tangible piece of proof that my dad would go to lengths in a manner completely against his nature because he loves me as his own kid.  

I am so sorry about the wall of text, but I haven't had the chance to tell that story properly before, and I'm feeling very nostalgic of late. If nothing else, I'm so glad I got the chance to type this out. Thanks for hosting this so I could!  

**TL;DR- My dad is awesome because he bought me a magazine.**"

Geohump,ADHD,1390480360.0,"&gt;To have really tried a drug, you want to start at a dosage so low you can't even tell you're on the drug, and you want to slowly increase the dosage until you get side effects, and then if the side effects don't go away, you decrease the dosage again until you stop having side effects. Which takes probably 3 months per drug.

Well, no.  Thats insane. 

We have the technology around to do an analysis of each individual to see which drug each person should be given.

The problem is the Psych industry isn't interested in good practical solutions, They're interested in immensely profitable solutions.

Out of curiosity, how much hit did Parsifal have on Reuben? I assume it would be greater than 0. Also interested in how much avoid I got.

So yeah the idea behind my character stat wise was dodging absolutely everything. I didn't want to ever have a weapon triangle disadvantage so I picked Whisper to get knives. I didn't pick Assassin because while lethality would have been nice, I figured a) I'd have more avoid as a whisper and b) there were like 7 assassins already.

Which I guess leads me to character justification fluff wise. Everyone else seemed to be making badasses. I figured having a total coward would be a neat foil to them.

Neurogenetic,graphic_design,1390480790.0,"Colour, definitely. You've got a reasonably well balanced and coordinated palette, whereas the black and white photos make the motif seem overdone and completely suck the life out of the page. It feels like I'm looking at a printed sheet rather than a rich website. The colour in the pictures also draws the eye to the content of the page. You've got your concise little blurb there about yourself as well as your contact details, so that's out of the way already. Good. They've already got everything they need to get ahold of you, so at this point you want to showcase your content, as it's what differentiates you from the rest. It's your main feature - putting everything in black just doesn't do it justice.

Also, you might want to turn down the gradient on your title (or perhaps add a little colour to give it just a tad more weight). Don't turn it completely off, but make it a more subtle. It blends into the background just a *little* too much. Otherwise I'm liking your overall design.

Story time: One fine day in a galaxy far far away, a baby was born whose destiny was to save the universe.  This baby was not you, nor has any relation to you.  Sorry to disappoint you, but you're not destined to save the universe.

On another day, however, someone had an idea.  This idea was to save a dying species.  Your birth parents, native to planet Glaxsor-15, teleported you across the universe through a wormhole to Mars.  You sat in a cryogenic container for 200 years until a life-form known as the Saarthunia found you on the edge of a large lake at the northern pole of Mars.  

A Saarthunian explorer opened the container, releasing a wave of cryogenic fluids into the lake.  The lake froze instantly and caused a change in the atmosphere of Mars completely.  Slowly the lush Martian environment began to degrade.  The Saarthunian people immediately took down all their structures and loaded their people up into large spaceships and flew off to find another home.

One Saarthunian could not bear to leave a baby to die on its own in the degrading environment and launched you in a small lifepod towards the planet we know as Earth.  Then you were found by a man and woman who adopted you and raised you.

Edit: *Now here you are today!  And I'm thankful for that, and this giveaway. ;)*"

C'est vrai que les femmes ont des coûts que les hommes n'ont pas, notamment en hygiène de la CHATTE mais bon, encore une fois pas plus que si elles étaient célibataires, et puis doit on en conclure que les hommes n'ont plus à payer le repas après la ménopause ? 
Et quid des lames de rasoirs pour les hommes?            

D'ailleurs, pour parler de l'épilation, ça par contre c'est valable. Ça fait partie, avec les lingeries coquines et autres dépenses du genre, des efforts mutuels dans un couple pour lesquels la femme a des dépenses beaucoup, beaucoup, plus grande que son conjoint.

I was originally a sub rogue, and what you'll find is that you'll have a difficult time if you don't gem/enchant/reforge correctly as Rogue (especially sub) is super gear dependent as a class in general. In terms of being better at the class skill-wise, make sure you're familiar with certain rotations, but also be aware that pvp is way more situational. Also, Subtlety has really nice burst potential, but you'll find that if you don't kill them before they break cc, or have help with cc, you'll have an increasingly hard time fighting i.e. trying to keep backstab on gyrating hunters. It's for that reason that I started pvping as Assassination.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390481700.0,"The fact that this *is* how some people act under the veil of anonymity is the point.  

In real life, people have the opportunity, from time to time, to get away with things. 

It is not how people act in ""polite society"" that becomes the issue. It's, ""of the people you only interact with in polite society, how many of them keep up that behavior when they don't have to?""

When you are alone with someone, polite society isn't in the room with you. When they are physically bigger than you, or have other powers over you, polite society can't stop them from doing what they want.  

You can try to get justice later for what they might do. And that fact stops some. But getting justice isn't easy, for many reasons. And people know that too.

These things *do* happen. All the time.

And these messages can be a reminder that, just under the surface, when polite society isn't around to see, some people are monsters.

This doesn't make all people monsters. This certainly doesn't make all men monsters. This doesn't even mean that people who send these messages are the same people that do these things in real life. 

But the flags are the same. The reminder is there.

That doesn't mean I, or anyone else, have to be constantly outraged about it. Even feeling this doesn't mean that we have to stay upset about it.

But there is a period of time it takes to process this, to come to terms with the fact that there are bad people out there and there's nothing you can do about it. And, in fact, you still have to interact with them from time to time. 

After that, it's not like each and every message is the end of the world. Or induces quivering panic. Or causes tears, or even real upset. 

But that doesn't make them suddenly appropriate behavior. And they remain one of the reminders of danger just below the surface of us humans."

wordserious,AskReddit,1390481794.0,"&gt;  The people who have the ability, talent, and discipline to make meaningful contributions to the world are already able to get full rides to excellent in-state universities.

You are assuming that only a small percentage of people have what it takes. I disagree. I do agree that college is not for everyone, but it should be for everyone who wants to and is able to do it.

&gt; Good old liberal idiocy (for the record, conservatives are also idiots).

That's an ad hominem attack. Just because someone disagrees with you, it does not mean they are idiots. I take issue with that. I am here spending my time arguing something I believe in with someone who has a different viewpoint, because I believe that communication is the only solution for the very divided society in which we live. Calling me names is not helpful to your side of the argument. For the record, calling both sides the same name does not fix the issue. I believe you owe me an apology for that one.

&gt;  The reality is that the government throwing money at price insensitive kids is exactly what got us into this expensive-college mess in the first place.

I disagree. I believe that what causes the problem is the idea that this needs to be financed and that kids need to pay back. I believe that kids and schools should be held accountable by academic standards, and not by financial/monetary standards. The government ought to pay directly for tuition on accredited schools, up to a maximum stipend, as long as the student keeps good academic standing. This should not be only federal, by the way. Both states and the federal government should team up on this. For instance, states might offer heavily subsidized in-state tuition, like they used to.

This would decouple academic choices from expected earnings. Society gets the diversity of interests and expertise it needs; government gets a simpler system; students get an education. I would be more than willing to double my taxes for something like this.

&gt; the solution is to throw more money at them???

No. The solution is to spend the right amount of money to maximize the ROI, except that the R in this case would mean productive, educated people working on what they love because they love it, as opposed to barely productive, barely educated people working at what they hate because they need to pay back loans. Not all return is measured in dollars.

I mentioned raising taxes above, but it may not be so drastic. Having happy, productive professionals with more money to spend would (because they don't need to pay student loans), I believe, be a net gain in the end.

There are a few examples of systems like this. Norway is the prime example, but there are others. In summary, I believe that education is the most important variable for a society. Educated people produce more, are healthier, participate more in politics and community, save more. In the long run, I believe that it costs more to keep an uneducated population than it does to educate them.

It was pretty rad, especially when one horse escaped its handler and went skittering away down the aisle of the barn. The thing that stood out most to my 5 year old self was that one of the horses had a goat friend that lived in its stall with it. Everyone's parents had them draw or write something about the trip and someone printed all of it together and gave every family a copy of the resultant booklet. Most of the kids drew horses or wrote about horses, but I decided to draw: The goat. With no explanation as to WHY I was the only kid drawing a goat instead of a horse, only a caption which said ""A Goat."""

It was obvious that the Patriots are able to outplay everyone and anyone, so the only way to get to an advantageous position was to somehow force their hand and anticipate their move.  Being Metal Gear Solid, the obvious move was to create an Insurrection from a son of Big Boss, triggering the Send In Snake routine. Ocelot did this *immediately*, while the others worked on a plan. All that mattered at that point is that Eva and Naomi were now ahead of the 8-ball: they knew that ""Liquid"" would rise up and Snake would be recruited to stop him. Naomi infiltrated liquids ranks to learn about whatever plan he came up with.

Remember, a lot of this was done on the fly. Naomi didn't even have the virus ready. The anti-patriots were making it up as they went song, to an extent - which is also one of The Patriots strengths. When Naomi learned that Liquid intended to seize control of the US infrastructure itself, she resized Snake would probably end up at the heart of the operation, knowing what it would take to stop Liquid.

Snake can't know about the plan because he is under Patriot orders - Campbell is very insistent that Liquid be taken out, but also that the status quo is for the best."

No. If the issue was paying for it, then the answer would be to pay for it.

The real issue is changing how people think about it, so they are happy to see the power usage and infrastructure costs split out on their bills. TBH, I think consumers would welcome more transparency, but the utilities like to play games with billing."

Penaaance,relationships,1390482571.0,"Secret online alter-egos are great. They let you vent and be silly and speak however you like with no drastic consequences to your waking life. But as soon as someone you know discovers your alter-ego, it loses its appeal. You have to begin to censor yourself, and it sucks, but the only other option is giving up on something you've enjoyed for so long and starting over from scratch.

In particular I want to respond to what you wrote about the tweets where she complains about you, or tweets things that you interpret as being about you. I have been in your girlfriend's shoes so I'll try to give some perspective. (Disclaimer: these are my own experiences and do not necessarily reflect the thoughts and actions of your girlfriend. For the purposes of clarity I say ""my boyfriend"", however, I do not do this in my current relationship, only in past ones.)

Sometimes I'm just so thoroughly pissed off that I need an audience. If I'm pissed off at someone who isn't my boyfriend, then I'll vent to my boyfriend. If I'm pissed off at my boyfriend, I have no one to vent to, so I turn to the anonymity of the internet. Why? Because:

* No stranger on the internet is going to take my boyfriend's side. They're not going to argue with or refute my (admittedly) biased and exaggerated accounting of events.
* In the same vein as above, strangers on the internet are more likely to offer me sympathy, affirmation and support. If I go and start raging at my boyfriend, the chances of him offering me any of those things are slim to none.
* What's the point of setting off fireworks if no one is around to watch them? Sometimes the only thing that makes me feel better is knowing that someone has read or heard what I have to say about my feelings. When I'm angry at my boyfriend, there's a chance he might be angry at me too, meaning he's extremely unlikely to listen and be understanding (and of course you cannot blame him for that at all). 
* As soon as I've gotten it all out, the anger's gone and I feel better, calmer and more forgiving. I feel bad about being so angry and for venting about my boyfriend. At this point I'm likely to delete the rant from my blog/twitter or what have you.
* Sometimes I'm just angry about something that's really hard for me to talk about because it's so trivial, or irrational, or something stemming from insecurity, and I do not want to lay that burden on my boyfriend.
* Sometimes - let's be real - my boyfriend is just a jackass and I really do have a valid reason for being pissed off. We're fighting, I'm angry, I'm upset, I feel like he is disregarding my feelings and he won't listen to me, he's turning the blame around on me, he refuses to see reason. I can't talk to him when he's like this, yet I want to shield him from the judgment of my friends and family, so I cannot tell them about it. I feel like I have nowhere else to turn.

I would be hurt as well if I found out my SO was bitching about me online (ignoring the hypocrisy of that). Probably the best thing to come out of this mess is that you get a greater insight into what makes your girlfriend tick.

I'm not sure what you should do. I'm not sure this comment will be well-received, but I hope it can at least give you an idea of your girlfriend's side of things."

Unlike the other branches, the Navy job scores are a composite of each section and easier to understand because of that; ie score X in AR + score Y in EI is what you need for MOS Z. 
If it isn't a part of the AFQT (the math and English parts) or related to your MOS score you need, don't study it. Saves you a lot of time and hassle, especially if you only have like a week or two to study like I did. A Google search will reveal a few good free online study guides (I'll post the links when I'm on my laptop). I wanted nuke so I had to learn the electric and mechanical  comprehension parts. AFQT was a cinch for me (97) but those areas I struggled. Plus I knew I didn't want a mechanic related MOS so I had no need to study the automotive and shop sections; I sadly have zero skills working with that stuff so no need to study for an aptitude test and get a good score, only to get stuck with something I didn't know how to do or enjoy doing."

That being said, I have terrible temperature control on triptorelin. Also made me weaker and triggered suicidal behaviour, though the latter subsided after 2 months during which my life was a constant trigger warning so take it with a grain of salt.

MoocowR,dayz,1390483066.0,"&gt;  If I die to zombie on the shore then spawn close enough to just pick up my gear, it's as if nothing happened and I continue on like its the same person.

How is this even a real scenario? ""A zombue killed me on the shore, but its no biggie since I spawned within 10 minutes of my body"" -Said no one ever.

&gt;This is why we need a skill system

A skill system that implements anything worth caring about(Speed buff, health buff, ect..) would bring imbalance to the game, players who run around in empty servers all day or leave their character logd on the top of a roof in an empty server while they go to work would have a huge advantage vs players who actually play the game. And anything less than that wouldn't be worth caring about regardless. 

&gt;Wow, it's rare to see someone so wrong while they think they're so right.

I don't even know how it's an argument that the reason a character doesn't have value is the users fault. He admitted he would rather die and lose everything then lose important items and go on with his life. It's not like when you get held up they're going to pick you dry, any one who already has enough to hold you up will already have guns/clothes/backbacks/misc items. The worst theyre gonna do is take your food and ammo. If you personally don't care enough about the rest of you gear then odds are you wont give a shit about side stats that make life easier.

&gt;This would make your hours alive actually mean something more than just the gear you have.

If having gear isn't worth anything to the player what makes you think that having skills would? Both take hours to get and both are expendable when the person behind the character is too stubborn to give up without a fight.

Once server hoping is fixed and people cant farm the same building all day you will see people actually start to give a shit about items other than just their m4 and mosin."

And since the few women you *can* date have no qualms about going for someone who's got twice your experience and income, you're facing some stiff competition.

Don't feel bad about going after 17 year olds; they're going to do all sorts of shit anyways, and if you can make sure they're doing it with someone who won't hurt or take advantage of them, that seems moral enough to me.  Try to make an effort to be the bigger person when you need to, and try to leave them better then you found them.

marissalfx,buildapc,1390483528.0,"GPUs, especially a large selection, are pretty difficult to keep in stock. They prices can drop pretty fast on these things, and new ones come out often. They're also pretty specific, every user wants something else, which is probably why you mentioned having a large selection anyway. Because of these reasons, you can end up with unsold GPUs that have dropped in price a lot pretty easily, which is bad since they are expensive. The same goes for CPUs.

I used to do purchasing for a small computer store, what we did was carry a few low-end GPUs for users that needed something ASAP to keep their computer running before picking a new high end GPU.

IMO cases are a good call, they always look a bit different in real life compared to webshop images. And they don't really drop in price or become obsolete quickly."

If Theo and Arsenal thought he was okay to make a comeback, then they're within their rights to do that. Arsenal didn't force Walcott to play. So if anything Walcott is ""playing russian roulette with his career"", to put the blame solely on the club with the little facts he knows just reeks of seeking to stir up controversy like he did with the statements about Moyes.

lordfuzzywig,CCW,1390483851.0,"No problem. If you need any more advice, don't hesitate to ask.

Real quick, before you consider buying -- which you should, by the way -- remember the following: follow the manufacturer's recommendations unless and ONLY unless you are in fear for your life or great bodily injury and do not yet want to escalate to deadly force.

What this means with OC spray is, in order.

* THREE FEET AWAY MINIMUM. This means if you can reach your arm out and touch them, then spray with the bottle against your body. If you they are two arm's lengths away, then extend your arm and spray. Do not spray closer than three feet unless you absolutely can justify your misuse.

* Only TWO one-second bursts to the area around the eyes, or directly in the eyes if possible. Aiming anywhere else is not appropriate.

* In the event of an ineffective deployment, reassess and spray again. This will be important.

So, let's say I'm faced with a guy who wants to fight. I don't. As I approaches me, I shout, ""STOP. GET BACK."" He continues to approach and I spray him in the areas around the eyes with a one second burst. His hand got in the way as I sprayed, protecting his eyes. **I will then REASSESS and determine it was ineffective and spray again.** Then continue this until I get an effective deployment or need to use my firearm. This means I may actually end up spraying 20 times. But I need at least one effective deployment within the manufacturer's recommended distance/etc. Make sense? :D

Using OC is not just a ""OH SHIIIIIIIT SPRAY SPRAY SPRAY SPRAY SPRAY"" until the bottle's empty. You can cause serious, permanent damage (hydraulic needling) with it if you do not follow the manufacturer's recommendations and going to court for self-defence will become the last of your worries. So knowing, being able to recite, and actually USING it in accordance with the recommendations is PARAMOUNT.

That's precisely why I never suggest anyone buy a taser or ASP unless they go to the manufacturer's training courses. If they do not, and they cause harm to their aggressor, they're in hot water. And if you think offenders won't try to prosecute you? You're lying to yourself. I knew an inmate, a rapist, that became a multi-millionaire in prison from a situation similar. That opinion doesn't get me much love on this sub, but it's reality.

Good luck and like I said, if you need any other advice, don't hesitate to ask while we have an open dialogue. :)"

Penaaance,relationships,1390483973.0,"You need to sit down and have a serious talk with him about it and how it makes you feel. Be honest, acknowledge your 'bad' behaviour and try not to come off as accusatory.

Another thing that springs to mind is that something about your sex life needs to change. You're getting him off up to 3 times a day, every day, yet he refuses to have sex with you, doesn't give head, and acts like pleasing you is a chore? Really makes you wonder why this 27 year old man has never had a serious relationship before, doesn't it?

I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with what I have to say, but my advice is to play hardball. There's a very fine line between using sex as a bargaining tool (wrong) and demanding that your needs be met (fine). At this point you've both established that your normal sexual encounters revolve around him, whenever he pleases, and in a very unfair ratio. That needs to change. You don't have to make a big deal about it, you don't even have to mention it. He wants to have sex? Foreplay first. He would like head? So would you. And so on and so forth. Right now you're playing by his rules. Stop. Make your own rules, and eventually he will engage. 

A few more things: It sounds like he may have had some kind of addiction to porn in the early days, which could still be causing problems now. He may benefit from therapy to explore this. That said, I think you would benefit from therapy as well, because it sounds like you could use some assistance dealing with your insecurity and anxiety surrounding this issue. Sex therapy/couples counselling is also an option."

Targettio,Guildwars2,1390484170.0,"The main mechanic with Ascended armour/weapons is time. There are 4 items which are called ectoplasm refinements, each of these recipes can only be crafted once per day.

For a full set of heavy armour you will need 16 Mitherillium and 24 Silk Weaving (iirc) so that’s at least 24 days just to craft the basic components. Weapons will take 8-10 days each.

These refinements are level 450 recipes, so you need to get your armour/weapon smithing to 450 before you can start, then you need to craft the refinements each day.

The other time element is the recipes. The insignia recipes cost 5 laurels, as do each of the armour pieces. So for a full set of armour recipes you need 35 laurels. (and another 35 if you want another set with different stats).

The final element is the cost. Silk weaving takes 100 silk bolts, which something like 5 gold per day. So to answer your question with regard to inflation, yes, silk is stupidly expensive, iron ore is the second most expensive ore and a few other ‘oddities’ because of the amount of mats needed for ascended items.

He works with gay people and thinks that somehow makes it okay, and is of the belief that the reason gay people endure violence and hatred is that ""now they want to announce it all instead of keeping it behind closed doors."" I asked him if he would still love me if I was gay and he said yes, but I know what that would mean. He would ignore that part of my identity, change the subject if it came up, and call any girlfriends my ""friend"" no matter what. Your boyfriend is not my father, but his views about gay people reminded me of that level of hardened bigotry, so ingrained that the person doesn't even realise how cruel it is. 

You've learned something very nasty and unpleasant about your boyfriend, and exposing a decent gay person to this in an attempt to use them as a tool to prove him wrong would be cruel (to the gay person) and pointless. Your boyfriend could just turn around and say he/she is the exception, or that they are lying, or something equally ignorant. Having him for a father would be a terrible burden for a gay son or daughter. 

I'm not trying to sound harsh, but you are being staggeringly naive here. It is not your job to change someone if they have spend their entire life resisting change. It is your job to look out for you, respect your own friendships, and be a bit more choosy about who you have children with. Seven years is a long time, but it's effectively throwing good money after bad if you try to invest more time in changing someone who doesn't want to change. "

ActingPower,DnD,1390484935.0,"You know the main reason behind why half-orcs exist, right? Orcs raiding human settlements and raping their women.

ILoveBigOil,AdviceAnimals,1390484980.0,"You're right, order does matter...but you have it backwards. You refinance at a lower rate first and make changes immediately after, or ideally concurrently.

If he already has debt, let's say at 10% interest, it doesn't matter whether he changes his lifestyle now or not; he's still in debt and paying 10% interest on that debt. That debt was exchanged for goods and services already rendered, so making lifestyle changes *now* will have zero effect on what has already taken place.

If he has an opportunity to effectively refinance his debt at a lower interest rate, he will save money by paying less interest. Again, it doesn't matter what lifestyle changes he makes, as those don't affect what he already owes. His monthly obligation will decrease.

If he can afford loans at, say, 5% interest, but not at 10% interest, then he is OK; if not, he needs to make changes to his spending habits. These changes will affect *future* spending, i.e. he will not need to borrow at 10% because he did not accrue the debt in the first place, but will have absolutely no impact on debt already accrued.

It's like when a building is on fire; you put the fire out first before you decide to stop dousing the floors in gasoline every night and overloading the breaker box. Both are necessary to prevent future fires but the fire was caused by past events that cannot be undone.

This is very similar to the argument about raising the debt ceiling in the US, if anyone is interested."
GTnicholas,philosophy,1390484992.0,"Well. Our definitions of capitalism seem to be the problem, and as you may be able to tell from my post I am not fond of the term, for this very reason. 

Would you be opposed to large scale trade with a medium of exchange and the ability to choose to trade your work for a medium of exchange?
If that isn't capitalism, then I am not a capitalist.

Also, unless feudalism counts as capitalism under your set conditions, then the state is not a capitalist creation and in fact predates it. If it does, then I prepose that your given definition of capitalism fails to meet the standard of regular use. 

Also, while I hesitate to call the corporation, rent seeking, special interest-lobbying, competition-crushing regulation, subsidies and military contracts Capitalism, I do not support those things. Again, this may not be your position given our definitional problem, but a market like the one I described above does not necessarily exist inside of a state, and while an individual, company or conglomerate might have an interest in taking up arms to dominate competition, customers and employees, everyone else has it in their interest to stop them from doing so. While we have failed to stop them simply due to the overwhelming power and ideological hegemony the state possesses, this does not mean it is not in our interest to stop them from using force to do those nefarious activities mentioned above.

I am going to ignore the sophist dig at libertarians because it is not an argument, it is the same kind of ideological language that you so despise later in your post.

I can't seem to understand your life-support metaphor, except to note that I oppose the use of force against the peaceful (yes, as a matter of ethics), this goes for the state's predation of the market and the markets use of the state to exploit and oppress.

I use the word voluntary exchange because that is exactly what trade is, and I have run into to many people that seem to confuse this with corporatism (as I think you have done with my case). I am not an American, nor have they indoctrinated me. And while I should even be responding to this ad-hominem, my economic views do not stem from indoctrination, but my ethics and a particular set of arguments from the Chicago school (this may be surprising by I think Keynes was wrong). I reject that the use of force on a monopolic scale not only by a leeching and inefficient state, but by oligarchs who dominate it and exercise its force for competitive advantage are not real problems.

While I would love to know what the institution of absentee property means, I fail to see a crushing failure in bad employee-employer relationships. That relationship is entirely a free one, if either party is unhappy, they can quit. You don't have a right to your bosses stuff, and your boss does not have a right to your time.

While I thank you for not directly accusing me of comprising my moral compass in favour of capitalism. I would caution that to accuse me of this would not be at all accurate. So many properties of Capitalism as it is practiced are morally abhorrent to me (most of them mentioned somewhere above) that I hesitate to even call it capitalism. I respect the autonomy and property of my fellow people as a necessity. I encourage altruism in myself and others, but I would not dare use violence or force to make someone act altruistically. I do however advocate the defence of persons and property from violence where you can. This is my rough moral position where it applies to our argument.

Also, why do you wish to structure society, from the top down in such a way. Would this not require the use of force or violence? Would this be applied to someone like me, who wishes to harm no more than he is harmed? Wouldn't such a practice be immoral? I can understand having an ideal structure in mind, but to impose it? I myself do not advocate using force to structure society, I just behave in such a way that I find ethical and -in the realm of trade- what I find economically efficient."

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1390485264.0,"Hey, it sounds like the pink cloud has dissipated. That happens. Life can be difficult, and we aren't guaranteed happiness every day. This is something that it took me a while to figure out, and I still haven't figured out the best way to say it, so bear with me. It's this:

People aren't supposed to be happy all the time, or feel good all the time. Sometimes we feel bad, sometimes we feel blah, sometimes we feel angry or sad, or any of the other wide variety of human emotions. This is as it should be. And really, if we were happy all the time, happiness wouldn't mean anything. Alcoholics and addicts learn to short-circuit our feelings with substances. Sad? Drink. Angry? Drink? Bored? Drink. Actually genuinely happy? Better kick that up a notch with a drink. We all know how well that works in the long term. (Hint: not well at all.)

I guess what I'm trying to say is that part of learning to live sober, for me, has been learning to live with emotions. Learning that they all exist, and that I will feel them all, and that they can't kill me. Learning to live in the moment, experience what I'm feeling, and know I won't feel it forever. When I first started going to AA meetings I used to hear people say ""learning to be a human being"". This is what I think they were talking about. 

No, its not easy, but its part of life. You can do it.  

You aren't guaranteed anything in this life, but you can ensure yourself sobriety today. Don't worry about the rest of your life or forever, just don't drink today. You can do that.

I end up feeling bad mostly for Neinor, but even that is muffled by the fact that I just can't wait for Turin to die already."

soitcause,changemyview,1390485329.0,"&gt;This is my point. I was totally shocked at first and continue to be disappointed.
Besides, I am sure some women think as you, I wouldn't generalize it as ""women victimize themselves"".

The most logical thing would be to stop generalizing about women being particularly perturbed compared to other groups, then. 

&gt;Oh to me definitely not. Being an asshole can't be helped, but misogyny to me is just wrong and has no excuse. It's cowardice and perversion in one package.

There are two problems at work in this situation: the abusive behavior and the behavior that puts oneself in a position to be hurt. Think about a physically abusive relationship. Of course the assailant is awful and morally reprehensible, but someone who continues to find themselves in relationships with abusive people also has issues that need to be addressed. The latter's actions are by no means malicious or negligent, but they're still problematic if we're talking about healthy behaviors.

I think we need to be careful about how we use words like ""misogyny"" in conversations like this. While it may be appropriate in this context, the word has definitely picked up a connotation that makes it much more hyperbolic than the word's actual meaning. I often hear people talk about online gaming communities as misogynistic, when what's actually being ridiculed are a set of traits stereotypically associated with female gamers. While I think there's certainly some overlapping that even the people who espouse that mindset aren't always are of, I think it's a significant distinction. I think it's also notable to mention that just because someone's yelling racial/gendered epithets online doesn't necessarily mean they're racist/misogynistic in real life. I'd argue that while those words have been adapted in the larger gaming community's vernacular, the meaning they carry is not synonymous with their meaning when you're face to face with someone else. A somewhat more salient example of this for most people would be the use of the word ""fag"" as a general insult rather than specifically insulting someone as being gay. The prevalence of this was so widespread such that [there's an entire South Park episode about it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_F_Word_\(South_Park\) I apologize for being nitpicky, but it's a bit of a pet peeve.

&gt;About the racial hatred IMO just going ""nigganigganigga"" is comparable to ""girlygirlygirly""

I think that because ""girly"" isn't a widely used word in general, doesn't have a historical precedent of use in online communities, and doesn't carry several hundred years of negative connotations that they really aren't the same.

All that said, I'm definitely going to try this when I get some free time over the weekend. This discussion has sparked some curiosity, to say the least."

When heating water (or another liquid), I find the microwave tends to heat the top first. This is different from a stove, which tends to heat the bottom first. Because the stove heats the bottom first and warm fluid rises, convection is created, which effectively stirs the water for you. In the right conditions, you can see this happening in the pot. Because the microwave heats the top, it doesn't create convection. Still, a quick stir, or heating in one container then pouring into another, will get the temperature even."

For example, there was a Seamaster DeVille that was in horrible shape on there that sold for almost $300. By horrible shape, I mean all the usual wear AND that the crystal and the bezel had fallen off of the watch. I think by now it's pretty well-known that you can find that watch in decent shape for the same price on eBay. The site does make me laugh sometimes.

To me, this seems somewhat similar to what happened when other mass media started gaining traction. It's no coincidence that newspapers played a huge role in working classes around the beginning of the 20th century. Neither is it a coincidence how important the radio was for the resistance in Europe during the Nazi occupation in so many countries. The same can be said about the protests and the hippie movement surrounding the Vietnam war along with the rise of the television as a medium.

The internet seems to be in that awkward phase between just gaining mainstream sway and use, and being censored and editorialized to quell the dangers that uncensored information poses to those currently in power. If that is the eventual course of the internet, then these waves of protests around the globe where the internet plays a pivotal part in terms of communication and information may die down for now. But if the people in power are not able to tame the internet as a media, the protests we are seeing now will eventually become more and more global and interwened beyond what we are seeing just now until global revolution may start to become a viable reality in the coming years with whatever good and/or bad that would bring with it."

That said, Fenns work pretty well with the Hunters. Mirage on them, plus built-in Vengeance makes for some crazy shenanigans at the start of the turn. I heavily recommend their UA and a Kithkar, though with Mirage the Kithkar is less important.

Typically what you want with him is an Impaler and multiple Bombers. If you can tag something with mortality, it's not going to survive all those bombs. Take advantage of Reform to stick your spells, use the Fennblades for Mark The Target. Something like a Runebearer helps due to his low focus and wanting to cast multiple spells a turn. 

A decent list might look like:

Hunters Grim +4

Impaler 5

Bomber 10

Bomber 10

Runebearer 2

Fenns + UA 10

Chronicler 2

Should be pretty straightforward. High def infantry get cleared by the bombers from a respectable range, while Fenns tie up any problematic elements on their minifeat turn. The biggest problem I see is taking care of very high armor (AS Stormwalls, ARM23 mulgs) as 4 boosted POW16 bombs isn't going to be enough to neutralize them, even with Mortality. "

plaidhat1,bestof,1390485662.0,"Actually, this is a [Type Ia supernova](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova).  Rather than core collapse, Type Ia supernovae result from a white dwarf star siphoning matter off from a companion.  Once the white dwarf has siphoned off enough material to pass the [Chandrasekhar limit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit) of 1.44 solar masses, the outward pressure of electrons whizzing about in their shells around atomic nuclei can no longer counter the inward pressure of gravity, and the star goes 'BOOM!'

This means that Type Ia supernovae are fairly regular.  They all occur right around 1.44 solar masses, and the process of going 'BOOM!' is similar enough for them all to be useful.  Astronomers around the world right now are watching this supernova (now officially named [SN 2014J](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/maps-faculty/maps-news-publication/maps1405)\) to see how it brightens and how it dims.  They can take that light curve (the measurement of how brightness changes over time) and standardize it, then use a bit of math (inverse square law) to say, ""If it took *this* long to brighten and dim, and its peak brightness looks *that* bright to us, then its absolute luminosity must be *this other number over here*, which means that it must be *so far* distance away.

Type Ia supernovae are exciting not just because a star is blowing up and we can see it, but because we can use them to [measure distances in the universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder#Type_Ia_light_curves).

Then she stares down Death, stabs it in the face with a sword, and finds herself not exultant and happy, but depressed and nearer despair than she was before. Then Faramir shows up and teaches her hope (which, tbh, is my least favorite part of her arc), and she goes on to become a just and responsible ruler with him in Ithilien. That's the transformation, for her. She's definitely a ""bad person"" in some ways when she becomes Dernhelm and leaves her people behind. She learns the lesson, though.

Can I ask: do you think Merry was equally bad for ignoring all the good reasons to stay behind in Rohan? Obviously his was less a breach of responsibility, but still, it was illogical and unnecessarily dangerous, to no real end but his own desire to fight."

EgaoNoGenki-III,relationships,1390485785.0,"&gt; You let her bf stay at your house for a few months after your sister moved out?

He kept claiming the excuse that he couldn't find another place to rent until he paid outstanding back-payments for his previous apartment. 

Why did he (supposedly) have back-payments? Because his old apartment's roommate supposedly skipped out on paying; in the last few weeks living in the same unit, the roommate allegedly would get raging drunk and shove a Blackberry in my sister's boyfriend's XBox, rip things and cause a s---storm.

Then that roommate ""promised not to pay"" (from what they told me), and ran to live elsewhere leaving my sister's boyfriend about ~$1,500 to pay the former landlord. Yes, I do wish he would have chosen a better roommate too.

Then I'd ask him periodically whether he'd been looking for a new place to live. He claimed to be looking, but ""not looking-looking."" The only reason why I didn't get more impatient was because he'd be gone much of the time hanging out with various friends, and then some new girlfriend he stayed with more and more often.

Then finally he moved to be with his girlfriend, and last I heard/read, they moved to Spain where he tutored English, and now they seem to be in Poland, where his new girlfriend is originally from.

&gt; You shouldn't let people do stuff like that.

AceroInoxidable,TheRedPill,1390485842.0,"Sure. She lived in another city, so we had been talking a lot by phone after we first met, and we arranged a weekend date where she would spend a couple of nights staying at my home.

* Eager to see me? Check.

* Willing to drive two hours to be with me? Check.

* Openly talking about her sexuality over the phone? Check.

So it was going well... and then the shit test came. She told me, the day before the day we were meeting, that *she wasn't going to have sex with me*! Just like that. Yeah, I know. I hadn't even asked. She caught me completely off guard, so instead of answering her something cool like ""What makes you think that I want to sleep with you?"" I just told her not to worry about it.

Anyway, she came to my house. We talk, we sit on my couch, I start touching her *a lot* and she starts kissing me. We have dinner and after a couple of hours playing around I try to go further and then she says that she can't, that we have to wait. And she starts telling me that she made her former boyfriend to wait **for a month** before sex, and tells me her story about being 14 years old and this 40 years old guy coming to see her at her school a few times and raping her once.

Then I told her that I didn't think that that event was impeding her to have sex with men, that a lot of women had experienced similar things, and told her about the ""readings"" I used to do in order to get an emotional connection with girls at bars, and added that she was the one who would have to convince me to have sex because I also had a bad experience when I was younger (jokingly expressed). I may have added: ""You'll end supplicating me to make love to you"" or something cocky like that, 'cause I used to say that kind of things a lot.

* She knew that I knew it was bullshit? Check.

* She could not use me as an emotional tissue for her fake internal tears? Check.

* She didn't see me offended or mad? Check.

* I din't call her a liar but I stated that the bullshit won't work on me? Check.

When I was 2+ years sober, I got bumped up to first class for a short flight. So, free drinks, served while the rest of the plane was still boarding, unlimited refills. When the attendant asked what I'd like to drink, that voice immediately said ""you need to order top-shelf liquor, or the experience of flying first class is completely wasted!"" Never mind the wider seats or convenience, never mind that it was 11am, never mind that it was a 45 minute flight with a major hub connection at the end, never mind I hadn't had a drink in over 2 years at that point. The whole experience was for naught if I didn't pour booze down my throat. (Alcoholism, you so stupid.) Instead I enjoyed some orange juice, and enjoyed my flight, and the next flight, and got home feeling OK instead of put through a wringer.

I'm glad you stayed sober on the flight. I assume you're in another country than you live. There can be some temptation to drink when away from home, but its my experience that staying sober away from home isn't much harder than staying sober at home. You can do it.

soitcause,changemyview,1390486201.0,"Typically not because there are laws that allow you to have sex with someone 2-3 years older than you if you're above the age of consent, but under the age of legal adulthood. So if you're 16 you could potentially have sex with someone who's 19, 17 with 20 etc. One of the problems is that people are sexually active before the age of consent, so if a 16 year old has sex with someone who's 15, they can technically be prosecuted. This is particularly an issue in high schools where you'll have people as young as 14 interacting with people as old as 19. While in terms of social networks this would seem acceptable to a lot of people, the older party can get in a ton of trouble if the 14 year old's parents are conservative about this kinda thing.

unicornbomb,PlantedTank,1390486533.0,"The second plant (pics 2/3/4) is a dwarf lily (nymphaea stellata). 

Dwarf lily is a pretty damn near indestructible plant that grows like a weed in seemingly no matter the conditions, but the lily pads themselves can be fragile if they aren't kept under water or super damp on all surfaces. They're native to the incredibly humid southeast asian rainforests.

Once they hit the surface of the water, they deteriorate quickly, particularly if the air is dry or you have lights that are running hot. Just snip off the damaged lily pads close to the bulb. 

You can also cut the entire plant off the bulb, keeping the roots mostly intact and stick it in the substrate. The bulb will keep sprouting new plants of it for quite a while (I have a bulb that is a year+ old and it still sprouts off new plants constantly -- I trade them in to the LFS for store credit with other various clippings) -- you can either return the bulb to the water and keep getting new plants from it, or just cut off what you currently have and plant those. 

Just make sure you wrap the plant/leaves themselves in a very wet paper towel if you take the bulb out to trim, since like I said -- super fragile leaves that dry out very easily and very quickly. 

You can also train the plant into a shorter, bushier shape and keep the leaves under the water -- just snip off every lily pad it starts sending up to the surface and it will eventually only grow shorter, underwater ones and require minimal trims. 

If you want to keep the surface plants and ensure they stay in good condition, a tight fitting, well sealed lid with only a small bit of space (a inch or less, ideally) between the water level and lid will help keep the humidity in.  "

A minimum-wage, full-time job nets you around 333 bar beers per month. That's pretty good. However, if we take 500cc to be the standard beer, you can buy nearly 700 from a supermarket for the same wages.

Cap_Had,explainlikeimfive,1390486799.0,"Many particles have a property we call electric charge. Particles with opposite charges attract each other, like charges repel, etc. You probably are at least a little bit familiar with that much.

I think the easiest way to picture electric fields is through static electricity. So imagine you take a balloon and rub it on your hair. You've probably done that or seen someone else do it. Once you do that, your hair sticks up and seems attracted to the balloon; that's because they became oppositely charged.  If you move the balloon further away, the attraction seems less strong, and if you move it closer, it seems stronger. That's an electric field at work. You can describe it by assigning a number to each point in space around a charged object which basically tells you how much another charged object will be pushed or pulled if it's at that point in space.

You also have magnetic fields, which are a similar but different concept that apply to magnets. It turns out that electric and magnetic fields are really actually two ways of looking at the same thing. When a electric or magnetic field changes (for example, when a charged object moves), it takes some amount of time for that change to move outwards in space. One way to think of a photon is as the smallest unit of that change. It is a wave, but it's not necessarily in anything other than space. Electric and magnetic fields don't need a medium to exist, so neither do electromagnetic waves."

Chickeny-goodness,Entrepreneur,1390486808.0,"My opinion is that you can always ask for more money, but personally I think its in bad taste to do it now.  It really does seem that you are asking for more money just because you think you can - and as the owner of a company, I hate it when people do that.  Employee's perceptions of how much money a company is making are often wildly off.  Did the owner plunk in $50K in startup money, and has he paid himself off yet?  You just made $25K in sales.  Has the company actually collected the money yet?  What are his actual expenses in comparison to the revenue?  At 9 months, I think that there's no way the company could have stabilized in order for the numbers to be meaningful.  The owner is under a lot of stress trying to coordinate this business and make the financials work out, and the last thing he needs is someone grubbing for more money, especially just because that employee thinks that the boss is now flush.

You should bear in mind that even though you may have a huge amount of responsibility, you're an employee (or minor partner after a year).  That's awesome, but you're not the founder, and as such, you can be considered replaceable. If you ask for an amount that isn't commensurate to what the market will bear, you've got a rude surprise coming to you one day.

Finally...I understand the desire to ask for more money, but I really suggest that you hold off for now.  Now's just not the time.  In 3 months, you can go up to him and say 'hey, I've been here for a year and I wanted to talk about how the company is doing, and see if there's any possibility for me to get a bit of an increase'.

SammaSunshine,relationships,1390487162.0,"You came to reddit to ask for help, yet you have argued with most of the people who came here to offer advice.  I'm not here to attack your values, or culture or any of that. Though I strongly disagree with much of what you've said, and some of the comment replies you've made, I'm not judging you and I want to give you the best advice I have. 


You avoided dating not because of your cultural values, or to make your parents happy, but because of your introversion and insecurity. Though you have a great job as a teacher, you devalue the work you did to get there. You don't think you are attractive, smart, or worth anyone's time. 

There is no way to make him love you more. Its not something you can force. The best you can do, and the most important, is learn to **love yourself**. You can't have a healthy relationship with anyone, you can't expect anyone to love you until you know how to love yourself. I'm not even talking about masturbation either, though that is something that needs to be learned too (because you can't expect anyone to please you if you don't know how to please yourself). This is the best advice I can give you. 

Men don't find insecurity attractive. No partner wants to be constantly re-assuring their partner that they are beautiful and lovely, and that they will do well in social situations and their job is good enough. While its nice to be encouraged by your partner, it is more important that you are encouraged by yourself. 

It has nothing to do with your skin color, your virginity, your career. Its about you, and how you feel about yourself. If you don't treat yourself right, you set the standard for how others will treat you. Be good to yourself. Learn to love yourself. You have so many more good qualities than you think. You got a degree and have a really awesome job. Teaching is important, and it takes a really caring, kind person to want to invest their lives in kids and education. You have more to offer than you give yourself credit for. 

Who the hell cares about his exes, their careers, or sex lives? He appears to want to be with you, doesn't he? You have something those women don't have. I'm going to quote Dr. Suess here, ""Today you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You."" You said it yourself, his parents aren't forcing him to marry you. No one is. He wants to, and its not because of your virginity. If he wanted a virgin, he could find one that he could sleep with and not marry. 



**TL;DR:** Love yourself. You can't make him love you but confidence is attractive and once you treat yourself right others will too. "

kakersdozen,gifs,1390487178.0,"""Troops"" is used as a catch-all term for military personnel. That's why it's usually used in news reports where the story is not about one particular branch or unit.

Off the battlefield, they all talk shit about each other and have a bunch of jokes about how dumb/lame/useless the others are. 

To call a marine a ""soldier"" is equating the USMC and the Army, and in their eyes, USMC is SO MUCH BETTER than the Army, so it's an insult. The same goes for the other distinctions- don't call a sailor a ""soldier,"" a soldier a ""sailor,"" etc. Most military personnel have an immense amount of pride in their branch, so they don't want to be confused with the others. In my experience, most military personnel won't get offended by it if a civilian makes a mistake because a lot of us have no idea, but they're likely to correct you and maybe give you some shit about it.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1390487198.0,"&gt; My question is that given the above why is it okay to still use the term Patriarchy?

Because it reflects who was in power centuries ago, and also present trends. Things have improved in recent decades but there are still trends visible. Example: where most corporate execs are men. 

I have no evidence women are prevented from being execs because of their gender. I think they don't get executive jobs because they are not aggressive enough, they are unqualified some way, or they just don't want them. 
But the word ""Patriarchy"" still reflects a condition, or trend. 

IMO: Do men sit around trying to ""prop up the patriarchy"" as an idea? No. Do they sit around trying to maintain their power and wealth (and thus their influence)? Yes. Those are a bit different. The former consciously supports an idea, the latter supports personal power. Human nature is such that once a person has power they want to hang onto it. 
That does not mean all men consciously are involved in ""the Patriarchy"" and trying to bring down women.

* If you want to be more successful romantically and sexually, it is a good idea to take some interest in your appearance and be more outgoing.

* If you're interested in casual sex, play the numbers game. Talk to lots of women.

* Don't put women on a pedestal. Most women do not need or want a worshiper.

* Stand up for yourself. Don't let yourself get taken advantage of either by fake friends or emotionally abusive relationship partners.

* Have confidence. Not even necessarily because it's attractive, but because it is required to get over your anxiety about talking to the opposite sex.

That's all I can think of right now. The thing is, all of this advice is widely available outside of TRP, and the things I consider poor advice or even harmful, sexist propaganda outweigh these nuggets of wisdom 1000 to 1."

To make it easier to converse, I think you should either organize an IRC channel for it or use [reddit-stream.com](http://reddit-stream.com) for comment threads (or both).

Also, you might want to check out a site called InstraSynch, it opens up a chatroom and streams the same video/playlist to everyone in it. For example, [this room](http://instasynch.com/rooms/kippster) usually has 3-10 people in it (although they're mostly US based so it'll be empty right now) and plays lots of disturbing documentaries/movies.

Not to seem like I'm trying to dissuade you from your idea but you may also want to check out movie subreddits' film clubs, for example I know /r/truefilm and some others have them, and there are similar subreddits like /r/movieoftheday, /r/100movies365days, /r/episodehub, /r/ijustwatched, /r/patientwatchers, /r/groupanime, /r/televisionclub and most similarly /r/letswatch. Not all of them are active, and this seems like it might be hard to get started/keep alive at first, so you may want to look into partnering up with some of the others and combining your efforts where possible.

Best of luck!"

Cap_Had,explainlikeimfive,1390487407.0,"&gt; The explanation I got from my physics professor was somewhat similar, although a lot more dumbed down for community college sophomores. His description was this: As light passes through a medium, it's always traveling at c. However, if the light runs into an atom, the atom absorbs the energy, there is a delay, and then it releases a photon, which again travels at c. In a denser medium like glass, this tend to happen more often than in less dense media like air.

The problem with this explanation is that you don't necessarily know that the re-emitted photons will go in the same directions as the ones that were absorbed. You would expect them to be emitted randomly in any direction; this would screw with things like lasers where all the light is traveling in the same direction; it would become totally diffuse and non-focused. But that doesn't happen. You can shine a laser through glass and it'll come out fine on the other end."

SoakAToa,FinalFantasy,1390487435.0,"Let's not oversimplify things. 

FF7 and 8 were released on the PC because of Square's fall out with Nintendo. The reasons listed at the time were that Square was seeking more hardware space for FMVs and such that the N64 cartridge didn't provide, but in later interviews it was plain arrogance on Square's part. They settled with Sony as its exclusive console licensor for a long while. After a couple years with Sony and a few single-generation ports later, the marketing data was coming in. Also, never having released PC games before, they discovered that PC players were modding their games. Putting two and two together, console was the way to go unless it was an MMO, which copied the model of many successful computer games at the time. Since then, they've returned to Nintendo for CC and ports and also explored licensing with Microsoft with FF13. So, they do have a history of moving around platforms, and FF7 and FF8 PC were the same sort of exploration.

As for the re-release, consider what I said about re-releases in general- they needn't put hardly any effort into it. Plus, the damage had already been done with regards to mods. Having seen the success of Steam, this re-release is an effort to get a few more bucks through ease of purchase. Why else do you think they released it on Steam as well as their own website? And as for piracy, the research is already in that people WILL pay for games via download if they're a fair price and/or are convenient. Besides, between PC or console versions, both are downloadable and could be emulated, like you said. Piracy just isn't a factor.

Lastly, there are rumors that FFXV could come on PC. This might be dependent on the research from their Steam re-release sales, who knows. If my theory is correct, they probably won't."

He is in the Air Force and we had been long distance for a year and half. We broke up because in two weeks he moves to England. We both agreed we couldn't continue our relationship if we were only going to see each other twice a year for three years.  It has been really hard, but not as hard as I thought it would be. I think it hasn't really hit me yet. I have been sad and hurt, but I still feel like I have him in my life.  Even though I still love him I have to tell myself that maybe this is best. We have differences and maybe in the long run they would have come between us. For now I am thankful that we are on good terms.

Eagle-Eye-Smith,lebanon,1390487855.0,"&gt;I was about to sing high-praise for your post until you ended it off on such a pretentious note.

Fair enough, but I think I was misunderstood.

&gt;Where does this superiority-complex originate from? Could it be Israel's former attempts to expand into southern Lebanon, to which you openly admitted they attempted to before?

Sure. I completely understand. But just because your mentality has a reason doesn't mean that it's right. Israelis have a ""everybody hates us, no matter what we do"" mentality. It has its reasons, and it stems from historical events- But that doesn't mean it's right or OK.

&gt;That's an incredibly dangerous mentality that's also prevalent within the U.S. Most of the wealthy Jews in the U.S. are also racist, bigoted right-wingers.

I wouldn't completely agree with that, but I will agree that many extreme-right wing jews come from the US.

&gt;Whilst you claim they are a 'minority', I can't help but get the impression that a lot of the Jewish people secretly harbor their sentiment. The Jewish crowd is notorious for their nepotism and their unwillingness to mix with other races.

Those are broad claims that are not supported by any evidence. As someone who actually lives here, I have not seen almost anyone who identifies with those sentiments outside of the religious crowd. All secular individuals who support settlements in the west bank support it from a main, core reason- they believe the alternative would be far more hazardous.

Also, ""The Jewish crowd is notorious for their nepotism and their unwillingness to mix with other races?"" Completely untrue. a lot of Jews in Europe and in the US have been mingling with the surrounding population since the beginning of the 20th century. The Jews you're thinking about are the ultra-orthodox, ""Haredi"" Jews- and these guys don't mingle even with Israeli mainstream society itself.

&gt;I'm not entirely convinced, and the way you ended your post supports my suspicion.

The end remark to my post was essentially this- People need to stop thinking that the world revolves around them, that the Israeli public are constantly plotting to take more Lebanese land for themselves, or (from the Israeli point of view) that all the arabs are constantly plotting to push them into the sea. This kind of black and white thinking is great if you want to sleep  at night without thinking too much about the consequences of your actions, but it's extremely dangerous as it devalues and dehumanizes the other side completely, and makes excuses for death and destruction easier to swallow. In reality, people on both sides couldn't give less of a shit about what happens on the other side of their city, nevermind a different country in the middle east.

People in Israel were outraged when the citizens of Gaza elected Hamas, which we consider a dangerous terrorist organization, into power, but the people of Gaza elected Hamas mainly because of its internal platform, not its views on external affairs. Same with Israel- The reason Netanyahu was re-elected in 2012 as PM had almost nothing to do with external affairs or even security- The entire election revolved around internal affairs. 

I remember arguing with my dad, who wanted to vote Likud about how Netanyahu manipulates the holocaust for political gain, how he hypes the Iranian threat in order to gain support from the public and how he clearly started the 2012 bombing campaign in Gaza in order to get votes (which promptly backfired- i'm assuming he planned to invade with ground forces, but was shut down by the americans- Causing the Israeli left to condemn him for the week of bombing and the Israeli right to condemn him for being a ""wimp""). To all of which my dad replied- ""Look, you're right. But while you're at it, can you please offer me any better alternative?"" And, to be honest, I really couldn't. Naftalli Bennet? That guy was even worse than Netanyahu. Yair Lapid? A populist and a jerk with a lot of slogans and no real initiative. Shaul Mofaz? Complete loser. Meretz, who used to be the only sane left-wing party in Israeli politics? Complete idiots whenever internal affairs are mentioned. The Arab-Israeli parties? They don't offer anything other than support to their sector. So all that was left was Netanyahu and the fringe parties. I ended up voting for Ale Yarok (supporters for legalizing marijuana), but only because I didn't want to avoid voting. I completely understand why people chose Netanyahu- As shitty as he is, at least he looked like a man with a plan. And at the end of the day, the plan had to do with mainland Israel only- No mention of Gaza, no mention of the West Bank, no mention of Lebanon or Hezbollah- nothing.

To summarise my final point- People care about other countries and the people in those countries a lot less than you think. Obsessing about the conflict will only turn you into a paranoid who thinks ""they are plotting to kill me and take my stuff"", when in reality, most people are scared (sometimes by events, sometimes by political spins) and react **because** they're scared. Whenever you think about the Arab-Israeli conflict, apply [Hanlon's razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor) heavily and constantly."

1. Teddy: Guy is as polished as they come. He's a football savant.

2. Garoppolo: This guy is shooting up boards for a reason.

3. Bortles: Huge, with a good arm. Questions about whether or not he's ready to start right away, but in our situation I think he'd be fine.

4. Brett Smith: Another solid prospect who will be available later (hopefully). Guy can sling it. Needs to work on his decision making.

5. Derek Carr: I keep trying to hate him, but the guy's arm is astounding.

GaProgMan,AskMen,1390487906.0,"Very basically:

 * My folks were in the Army, stationed at a remote base
 * They filled in the forms required to register a birth in numerical format
 * The CO read a ""3"" as a ""2"" and wrote ""February"" on my official papers.

I was born in March, but registered as February. The problem with this is that some things don't require ID to sign up for (my bank account was created by a family member for me, before my folks travelled back to my ""home country"" with me, and didn't need a copy of my birth certificate to do so), whereas some do.

Depending on where different agencies and companies pull my data from, they'll get one or the other. This is a huge pain whenever I need medical treatment because I'm on most systems twice.

I could have had it changed when I turned 16. I'd have had to go through this process:

 * Apply for a passport with my birth certificate as ID (I was unable to travel out of the country as a youngster for this exact reason)
 * Fly to the country where my parents were stationed.
 * Get an appointment with whatever pencil pusher could help get the Army birth certificate changed
 * Go to the local embassy, explain the situation and apply for a temporary passport to travel back home with
 * Re-apply/edit my details for everything, and deal with issues later down the line as they come up (over time these should become fewer and further between)

_____  
  
The sayings you hear growing up often hold much more meaning in those moments of clarity - the moments you find yourself piecing together your past mistakes, except this time, you're looking through a kaleidoscope and you can see all of the different angles you missed before. Suddenly, it sort of dawns on you that those stones they threw were in defeat - that the grass was always greener wherever the sun shone brightest - and that you either are or are capable of being perfect, depending on how *you*, yourself define it. You speak and for once feel confident in the tone, the emotion your words can't convey. Admitting defeat becomes easier as you wonder what opportunities you'd missed. It's that welcome type of regret. The type that reminds you that you're human, and that the world will keep turning after your death - and why take things so seriously all the time? Why spend energy helping those who don't need it - those who welcome failure and take something from it? Why not be more like them? It seems like those people stand a lot taller in times of true struggle where the rest cower and give up the torch. They are the people who have accepted death as a possible result of risk. With each thrown stone, they stand taller and their words carry further.  
  
I remind myself that perfection comes from failure in its truest form - failure, if experienced and learned from with honest intentions and humbleness, can be considered practice. No one ever limited us to one attempt - we hold ourselves back. We don't stand up and fight for the right to *experience*.  
  
And *that*... that reminds me that forgetting to feed the cat, or waiting far too long to attend college, or whatever else I can come up with, are merely five percent of this life I have to live - and I don't want to waste my life reliving meaningless moments. It's time to create something **new**."

It'd be absurd to suggest that there's something wrong with that choice; someone committed to domestic work yields untold benefits to both families and communities.

If most women choose domestic work, however, then that means that we've got fewer who choose to become scientists and CEOs.  Even if we *tell* girls that they're free to make whatever choice they like, if they see that in their *actions*, most women choose to stay at home, we've created an environment in which girls see that while they could pursue a career, the normal thing to do is to become a stay at home mother.

There's absolutely no wrongdoing on the behalf of any of these women, but it still leads to an environment that promotes the same gender roles that we've seen for the last two thousand years.  I simply don't see a solution to it.

Eagle-Eye-Smith,lebanon,1390488042.0,"Which is completely legal. Why, you might ask?

Because of section 15 of the [United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8808.doc.htm), taken after the war in 2006, which states-

""Decides further that all States shall take the necessary measures to prevent, by their nationals or from their territories or using their flag vessels **or aircraft**:

“(a)  The sale or supply to any entity or individual in Lebanon of arms and related materiel of all types, including weapons and ammunition, military vehicles and equipment, paramilitary equipment, and spare parts for the aforementioned, whether or not originating in their territories; and

“(b)  The provision to any entity or individual in Lebanon of any technical training or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of the items listed in subparagraph (a) above;""

Which means, in simple terms, that every nation, **including Israel,** can freely penetrate Lebanese airspace, perform reconnaissance and even attack targets as long as Hezbollah continues to purchase and receive arms.

The reason this resolution is in place is because Lebanon currently has an army which is not subject to the country's control. The UN put this clause in place so that Lebanon couldn't have their cake and eat it too- it effectively has an army (Hezbollah) with no accountability, since it's not governed by the state and cannot be addressed through the UN.

With this clause, the UN is effectively saying ""If you don't care about getting Hezbollah's shit together, then we will do it for you."""
soitcause,changemyview,1390488043.0,"&gt; a category of consenting adults with people who **want to rape children** as they can't consent

While practically speaking acting on their desires would result in rape, saying that pedophiles **want** to *rape* children is beyond fucked up. If I fantasize about a girl, who happens to be an alcoholic that is constantly drunk, does that mean that I want to rape her? Absolutely not. One's physical desires are completely removed from their desired partner's mental state (unless you get off on something mental). Pedophiles don't get off to children suffering; they get off to children. If there were a way for pedophiles to be without children without causing them massive harm, I'm sure they would opt for that option. Unfortunately it doesn't exist. 

The reason pedophilia causes people such distress is that they have no outlet to fulfill their desires. In the past couple decades, the DSM updated its definition of mental illness to specify that the condition must be dysfunction *in the context of the individual's culture."" If we had a culture (like many cultures used to be) where having sex with children/young adults (because when we talk about pedophilia we're really also talking about things like hebephilia and such) was appropriate, this people wouldn't be considered dysfunctional and would live their lives ""normally."" 

Interestingly, if you go back 100 or so years when being gay was really, really not cool, you could classify homosexuality as a mental illness under the same reasoning of being culturally dysfunctional. Today we don't see it as a mental illness, but that's largely because cultural attitudes regarding homosexuality have drastically changed. So sure, you can say that pedophilia is a mental disorder **now and in our current society**, but there's no reasoning for the nature of the condition to be dysfunctional in and of itself. Interestingly, a similar case can be made for a couple other conditions (psychopathy being the major one), so there's a lot of room we have to expand our understanding of ""mental disorders"" and the difference between psychological dysfunction and non-culturally appropriate inclinations."

If you don't go on it now, and your skin gets worse, you're going to have to go through all the hassle of getting it all over again. If your acne is bad enough for a dermatologist to prescribe accutane, it's unlikely that anything else will really fix it. It's 5 months of side effects for clear skin, for most people clear skin for the rest of your life. 

There are some side effects, but I honestly can't say their any worse than the side effects from the topicals and antibiotics I was on. It's different for everyone, but the occasional bloody nose, having to put a lot of lotion/chapstick on, mild stiffness/joint pain if I don't work out and stay limber, and worse skin for 3.5 months (until it got way, way better all of a sudden) has totally been worth it. 

I was kidding myself that it was getting better. I'm sure it would have just gotten worse for no reason again a couple months later. Now, it's not only way better, but it'll STAY way better.

Currently I'm wearing a size 8 (US)in jeans and depending on the fabric a Medium or Large (US). 

I carry my weight in my stomach. 

When I was 115lbs I looked anorexic though I wasn't, (I worked out 45 minutes 5 days a week and couldn't get thinner). Or at least people commented that I looked anorexic because my collar bone stuck out a lot, my elbows and wrists were knobby, and my chin was really pointy. I remember thinking I was fat because my frame is wide unlike my friends and my stomach had a little bit of fat. I felt that because I wasn't at the bottom of my weight range according to BMI that I was fat too. 

I later realized BMI is okay to reference but not gospel, my frame is wide so I will never look like my friends, I look better with more weight on me or at least I looked more womanly and people commented on me more, and fat below the belly button is common for women of child rearing age (exercise will help).

As for your frames: I think they could definitely work, but personally, I'd prefer frames that are a little longer. However, that might mean you have to get custom frames, so I would understand if you wanted to stick with these. 

If you go with those three frames, just make sure you (1) space the frames out evenly when you hang them, and (2) try to color coordinate the art you put in each frame. 

If the wall still looks a little empty after they're hung, then I suggest putting two tall objects on the media center itself — for instance, tall vases. (The vases can be empty or they can have dried grasses or fake plants in them.) Put the two vases on each side of the center frame. This will make the wall look more ""done."" When I say tall vases, I mean sort of like [this](http://www.pinterest.com/pin/196047389998705458/), though they could be any color you want and you could probably get away with them being a little shorter.

Specifically Byzantine was referring to illegal acts such as child porn. He was not talking about infringing data. Infringement in this context is as you said- not liable.

An ISP does deep packet inspection and finds out that the person they are inspecting is involved in a kidnapping ring. Or extortion or a host of other things. Now what? If they can recognize what they have and pass it on then they facilitated a crime.

Thankfully I had a few friends who got me into the game and they supported me thought the learning curve (which is pretty much vertical in the first few games).

You can transfer other pokemon to the pc once you catch your sixth in the wild. But that is a one way trip and you need to go to the pc to get new pokemon specifically because you need them to teleport that specific pokemons pokeball to you. It is explained in the show right after ash catches crabby I think. (God damn im old...). Also it shows that people like prof. Oak take care of all the pokemon in pokeballs.

Tuala08,AskMen,1390488591.0,"Hahah believe me, I don't want any part of twilight. No, I don't want someone unique for me, I do not believe in soulmates etc.   But I think it is important to choose a mate for more reasons than they are the sex you are attracted to. Ie there should be something else there than they are just nice etc.  I was in a relationship where someone dated me just because I said yes. I eventually found out he didn't give a shit about me personally, there was noting about my personality that he was all that interested in. I was a girl and I said yes and that was all that mattered to him.  I would like to think that someone read my profile and thought oh she likes x, she does y and she thinks z, therefore, I want to meet her because I think we could be a good match.  Likewise I would like to see enough on someone's profile to be able to make such a decision.  It has nothing to do with this person is unique and this other person isn't.  It's what is somewhat unique about this person that would make us fit well and it doesn't have to be a big thing, or something only that person has because that's not possible. Everyone deserves to be loved but I think it works much better when we choose people to love based on concrete reasons. Therefore it's not settling. Sure I like men, and I think a lot of them are awesome, but I think it's okay to say not all of them are for me romantically. I don't think settling is a good thing, you should be with someone who you like because they have qualities you respect and enjoy."

PerfectHair,rage,1390488862.0,"Something to think about.

&gt;I read a study once on objectification. Wish I could recall it to link--if anyone does some google-fu and finds it, please post. The conclusions were that women were more objectified than men by the test subjects. This gap persisted even as objectification increased with the degree of nudity. The entirely naked man was less objectified by people than the entirely naked woman. But one finding of the study was that the more one objectified a person, the more one could acknowledge that person as being able to experience things.

&gt;That is, in the true nature of ""object"" as pertains to a person--that is, the inability to ACT, because one is an object--the action function did not leave a null space and leave the person devoid of humanity. It was replaced by the experience function.

&gt;We see naked people as objects. We also see them as vulnerable to the actions of others. We judge the ""objects"" by their experiences, and the ""agents"" (fully clothed women, and especially fully clothed men) by their actions. We objectify women more than men. Two naked people, standing in front of someone, will be judged differently based on their gender. The man will be more likely to be seen as a moral agent--someone who acts upon others, and who should be judged by his actions rather than what led up to those actions. The woman will be more likely to be seen as a moral object (or moral patient)--someone who is acted upon, and who should be judged by what has happened to them, rather than as someone who exercised personal moral agency.

ljak,DebateReligion,1390488866.0,"&gt; (in Christianity and other monotheistic religions) the creator and ruler of the universe and source of all moral authority; the supreme being.

You promised me a common definition of the word God. Instead, you've defined God according to three specific religions, all of which derived from one religion approximately 2000 years ago. How is this a common definition?

&gt; In theism, God is the creator and sustainer of the universe.

So pagan religions are atheistic because their gods do not create or sustain the universe. Is Hinduism atheistic because it has a separate creator god (Brahama) and a sustainer god (Vishnu)?


&gt; synonyms: the Lord, the Almighty, the Creator, the Maker, the Godhead; More Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh; (God) the Father, (God) the Son, the Holy Ghost/Spirit, the Holy Trinity; the Great Spirit, Gitchi Manitou; humorousthe Man Upstairs ""a gift from God""

There is no religion in which those words are synonymous. Those that derive from the Hebrew Bible (Lord, Almighty, YHWH, Holy Spirit) have very distinct meanings in that text. Orthodox Jews believe that they represent different properties, or aspects of God, whereas historians believe that they originally represented entirely different deities in the local pantheon. Similarly, those that derive from the Christian Bible have distinct meanings and properties."

On the inside, we don't seriously punish or de-incentivize prison rape, or really make even a half hearted effort to combat it. On the outside, we either dismiss it as unfortunate but not worth caring about, or actively condone it: things like ""he's in prison, he deserves to be raped,"" are considered agreeable statements.

[Here's](http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~iversen/PDFfiles/LottKenny.pdf) a paper titled ""Did Women's Suffrage Change the Size and Scope of Government?"" [(TRP discussion)](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ljejd/women_see_the_government_as_insurance_why_single/)

Here's a discussion titled [""Women's suffrage is the worst thing to happen to Western civilization: Allowing women voting privileges. We were warned.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dok0q/womens_suffrage_is_the_worst_thing_to_happen_to/).

And [a discussion about a video of a guy who gets a bunch of students at an all gilr's school to sign a petition to stop women's suffrage](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1jpa39/will_you_sign_the_petition_to_end_womens_suffrage/).

I agree with you that it has definitely less to do with political ideology and almost everything to do with *tone*.

Think about how we censor ourselves, as men, around women. With the exception of, maybe, our very closest of friends. The way we speak to men and women is very different.

We are generally very overt and to the point with men, but with women, we often feel obligated to switch to a much softer tone; always worrying about how they are feeling (or how we might have sex with them or their fiends).

As soon as women entered politics, the whole country began speaking as if women are always listening. Who knows, now one of them one day might become powerful enough to end your career just because she doesn't *feel* comfortable around you.

Women, as inherently selfish as they are, surely noticed how easily it was for them to influence politics through little more than showing up in their Sunday bests and crying ""oppression"". From there, if they didn't benefit from it in a direct way, any man who had a vote and also had a wife or a girlfriend at home was frozen out of the bedroom.

Everything has rolled downhill since.

Marriages are held together by tape, children are growing up without fathers and being raised by child gardeners, and our elderly are dying alone in nursing homes all so that women can be ""empowered"" and ""independent"". (Read: ""fuck a lot and never feel responsible for anything."")

Like a bunch of spoiled little kids.

It's our fault though. We've treated girls and women too favourably over the mellenia. Protected them and adorned them with gifts. Treated their pussies like a bag of diamonds. Once you take the leash off, they are going to continue to behave (for the most part) like spoiled little children who believe that their pussies are as valuable as a bag of diamonds.

For so long women and girls needed to do nothing more than look good and keep a tidy house. Whether that's fair or not, you still end up flooding the dance floor with all kinds of people who've never danced before, and then given them full control over the turntables.

They play what they want, when they want. They deny anybody they want from dancing with them. And even if none of them want to dance themselves, nobody else is allowed on the floor (unless they are a cute frat boy who comes from money).

When you've spent thousands of years playing with dolls, make-believing a world where everybody is a princess and drinks tea, what value can you be expected to bring to the world of politics? *""Treat everybody like a princess and make sure everybody gets tea! ...except for the creepy guys and that girl who kissed my ex boyfriend.""*

It's unlikely that women's suffrage will ever end, so it looks like we're in for (possibly) decades (or even longer) of women trying to figure out how to politic objectively. But are they self-aware enough to be able to recognize when things are off course, and then have the capacity to admit that they were wrong and then have the strength to right the ship?"

I was on Estradot estradiol hemihydrate 150ug/24hrs for 2 years before I started it, which caused my testosterone level to decline to about 4nmol/L. I'm only on 11.25mg of triptorelin as a result (I was put on it because I have SRS coming up, and the clinic wants to ensure my body is ready for the post-castration levels of testosterone). But yeah, I was on cyproterone acetate for 2 weeks, and I don't remember feeling extraordinary in the 2 weeks after that, so I presume the effect took about 2 weeks? 

Yeah, still is. I usually go to bed very late and my boyfriend is sleeping, and if I accidentally touch him he instantly wakes up and goes ""AAAAH damn you, hair of fire but hands of ice"". Depends on the person, of course. And yeah, I bought a bobble hat and gloves for the winter too, northern England is a mean mistress for a southerner :P

And yup. Though, again, not sure if it's because of the triptorelin or because I was having a really rough time... or both. I have a significant history of suicidal behaviour, which certainly can't have helped. Having people keep watch is definitely a good thing either way. 

No problem! If you want to know the other effects, I also noticed heavy amounts of eczema and dandruff (very bad history of dry skin), and a resuming of breast growth (had stopped a year prior), as well as a mild reduction in libido and judging by the sheer translucency of the... stuff... spermatogenesis has all but completely ceased."

**Edit 2:** As apperantly some people cannot view all answers here are a few from other users:

* /u/zeekar Here is the link to the [most detailed comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1vxo78/what_are_some_things_worth_memorizing/cex4nup)

* /u/ja734 **Another good answer:** 
its a trick you can use to calculate the day of the week of any date, past or future, in your head. each year has a doomsday which is one of the days of the week, and certain key dates in that year will always be that day of the week. for example, the doomsday of the year 2000 was tuesday, so 7/11, 11/7, 5/9, 9/5, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12, 6/6, 4/4, and the last day of feb were all tuesdays that year.

* You can look up how to find out which specific day of the week is the doomsday for each year on the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule) OP posted.

**Edit 3:** I know what doomsday originally refers to. I meant to ask about the doomsday from the doomsday rule. Thank you anyway for your answers. :)"

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1390489770.0,"enabling your daughter's mental illnesses by paying for her to cope with the world by abusing substances helps no one in this situation.  i have been a depressed, self-harming, self-starving teenaged girl.  did pot help me cope? if i'm honest, yes it did, but treating depression with weed is like putting gauze on a wound that needs stitches.  yeah it makes it hurt less, sure it makes it bleed less, but the flesh won't heal until you actually fix it because something with always keep tearing it open.

here's the thing depressed people perpetually feel trapped and powerless.  your daughter probably sees weed as an escapist window.  it's the lifeline she's currently got that's keeping her from wanting to die all the time.  try and take that away and the entrapment will feel complete.  a depressed person will often respond to the sense of total powerlessness with rage.  after all, from your daughter's perspective, it really can't get any worse... why not be mean?  life's pointless and terrible anyway.

i don't know anything about you beyond what you've included in this post, so i certainly don't know for sure what your best course of action is.  my recommendation:

take a look at your finances and benefits and figure out what professional mental health options for your daughter are within your means (cognitive behavioral therapy was a godsend for me) and put your money towards that.  stop buying your daughter weed entirely, or, if this really doesn't seem like the best option, give her a monetary allowance and let her budget her own drug money.  

the more tiny little annoyances you eliminate from your daughter's life (such as buying her own weed) the more you cultivate her learned helplessness and exacerbate her feelings of no control over her life.  like it or not you CAN'T make the world a perfectly safe bubble for your daughter and the more she comes to rely on you to fix her problems the more she'll come to resent you as the reason she cannot function as an independent adult.

if possible, consider counselling not just for your daughter, but for yourself or even the pair of you together.  while it is clear you care deeply for one another, it is also evident you both are acting as highly destructive forces in terms of one another's well-being.  my condolences that these circumstances have befallen you, but there is a great deal of hope for both of your futures if you don't allow a cycle of shame and numbness repeat itself."

You want as little licenses as you can, this negating any chance that you have to drive vehicles anywhere. 6 years in this Feb and I don't even have a paper license. 

Rookie"
Milazzo,AskWomen,1390489798.0,"Oh, this is fun.   
Pros:
     
* Lots of whimsy  
   
* Worked hard to get to the ""Work to Live"" stage
   
* Extremely supportive of my partner, ranging from cheerleader to coach  
   
* Always up for anything - want to go to the Opera? Sure! Want to go to a book signing? Absolutely! Hang out at a coffee shop? Let's go! Participate in a hackathon? Sign Me UP! Randomly travel to Vegas and place odds against the 38 point spread for the Broncos? SHOW ME THE MONEY.   
   
* Extremely loyal - Cheating ain't my thang.   
   
* Very communicative - there isn't a passive aggressive bone in my body. 
   
* Easily amused - I will genuinely laugh at all of your jokes, and because I am nerdy across many different topics, I will also get your jokes about Physics and the Avengers. THE CAKE IS A LIE.    
   

Cons  
     
* Independent and stubborn - I am the oldest daughter of a single parent household. I raised my sisters, I paid for my college education, worked from the age of 16 (and done my own taxes), and was on my own financially since 18. This means I usually prefer going fifty-fifty on things, I really don't like being showered with money or gifts, and if I have a problem, I appreciate support, but I am going to solve it myself and with my own decisions. This intimidates the hell out of a lot of men.     
      
* Flighty - I am a roll-with-the-punches person, which makes me seem flighty.    
   
* Worrier - On the inside, I worry about EVERYTHING. This tends to be evident once I am in a LTR.   
   
* Extroverted - this is a pro, but it is also a con. I am fine being on my own, that was something I had to learn later in my twenties, but when I am in a LTR, I need quality time and quality communication with my SO. Like NEED. Dating introverts who have entire conversations in their head and filter before saying two words is torture to me. Of course, that happens to be the type I am attracted to. Sigh.   
   
* Jealousy - never unreasonable, but I have lower self-esteem because of being cheated on in two relationships, so it makes me extremely uncomfortable to discuss my SO's ex-es or people they are attracted to. I am also slow to introduce men to my friends for this reason (I have insanely beautiful girl friends).

You can find the sort of radfems who are represented by many uses of this meme intolerable without even ""slightly sliding"" into general contempt of all women everywhere.

The second reason your entire argument is wrong is that you've chosen to view using it as a critique of feminism...or at least its radical fringe...as somehow not fitting the mold of college liberal.  I'm sure you could argue the ""college"" part of that until the cows come home, but feminism is fairly well known for being a left-liberal movement.

Misogyny does exist, but playing the Misogyny Card every time a man says or does something you don't like doesn't make that man a misogynist.  It only serves to weaken the seriousness of the charge, especially in cases where the man and his words/actions are reasonable and conspicuously void of any noticeable ill-will."

Didn't know there was any air to clear, you were rude to me when I called you out for just talking about pokemon on a me3 subreddit so as far as im concerned, I was pretty happy you left. You were good when you actually cared about this place, but as soon as you stopped doing the one thing you did actually do (LFP threads), there really was no reason for you to mod here anymore. Especially as all you talked about was pokemon.

&gt;In order to make this post relevant, I'm also enclosing within this post a build of the last character that gave me joy. It's a Salarian Engineer with a Reegar Carbine. Use Incendiary IV ammo with Incinerate and abuse the DOT glitch to burn everything to death.

slangwitch,AskMen,1390490041.0,"Was the pain of insertion worse than the pain of pregnancy and then delivering a baby, though? Or the pain of not sleeping well for a year or more (while you're trying to support two whole people all by yourself!) because your unplanned for kid is a weirdo with a silly sleep schedule and you don't get any paid time off from your crappy job for maternity leave? A little pain for a day would be totally worth it if the rest of the experience wasn't all that bad. You have to weigh that against the benefit of getting to choose when exactly you are ready to have kids. So much better to bring a child into the world when you can take the time to care for both it and yourself. A few cramps can't possibly outweigh that benefit. 

I have heavier periods with it, but I will gladly deal with the worse cramps and needing to change pads more often on that day or two rather than the craziness that hormonal  contraception causes or the life changing tragedy of an unplanned pregnancy that I'm not ready for. I think it's best not to spread fear about the IUD like this as many people handle it fine and it's the best option for them considering how difficult it is to find a good non-hormonal option (short of sterilization). 

The OB/GYN should be checking the patient for risk factors (small uterus, etc), informing women of what kind of pain or bleeding is and is not normal and then the patient should weigh the pain they feel against the benefits they receive. 

Hearing the abnormal horror stories isn't going to help that much. If a woman tried it out and needs to remove it due to these issues then that is okay but many women have a perfectly decent experience and prefer the minor discomfort they will experience to an unplanned pregnancy. A good doctor will be able to assess a woman's risk of having a bad experience and help her pick the best method for her. 

In my experience the insertion was uncomfortable but not  problematic. My periods became very heavy and painfully crampy for one day of my cycle and for the first year I could get cramps if I were very constipated as well. Those are the only issues I have had and overall I love that it was a one time payment for the most reliable birth control option out there and required absolutely no thought or effort on my part to maintain. 

I had fear mongering friends who told me that IUDs are very risky and I would regret it, but those same friends seem to believe that curved penises can damage a woman into sterility or they didn't get the HPV vaccine (though it was available to them cheaply at the time).  Misinformation about sex is rampant, no need to spread fear about a great birth control method that prevents many women from having to face the difficult choice of whether to have an abortion. 

Like anything else, a person should educate themselves pragmatically and see a good doctor rather than avoid something entirely out of fear. IUDs do have drawbacks to consider, as do all birth control methods, but the general experience of women with them is not the same as the outlier horror story. Most people just need to take a couple extra pain pills a month and reschedule any heavy workouts for the next day when the cramps settle down. Insertion itself is not fun but it is also not always awful. The main issue is that you must develop a mental acceptance of the foreign object being present (you won't feel it usually, but you know it is there and that can be weird initially). Being afraid of it will just make that development of comfort more difficult. "

Zeppelanoid,slowcooking,1390490389.0,"Recipe (I looked up a few and then just winged it):

- Two skinless, boneless chicken breasts

- A whole ~350ml bottle of Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce (use whatever kind you like)

- Some ranch dressing (I'd say about a tablespoon or a bit more)

- Garlic powder (I had no real garlic and was stranded indoors)

- Butter (about one tablespoon, added later in the process)

Instructions: Put chicken in slow cooker. Cover in sauce (I put wayyyyy too much...live and learn **EDIT**: another user has correctly suggested that this amount of sauce would be enough for 4 chicken breasts). 

Add ranch and garlic powder (or crushed/minced garlic if you have it).
 
Mix it up and make sure the chicken is coated. 

Set on low for ~5 hours. 

Take chicken out. Add butter to the sauce in the slow cooker (a tablespoon roughly). Pulled chicken apart, put back in sauce and cook on low for another hour or so. Put it on a bun and call it a day!

All told it took no longer than 15 mins prep time. I played video games while I waited. It was a nice day.

**EDIT**: Leftover sauce was mixed in with cooked white rice. It's orgasmic. I may ""accidentally"" put too much sauce into future slow cooker recipes. "

Much better than you did, because they'll have real people and hard facts to support their decision-making. I'd be interested in seeing the research as well. Currently I only have my personal experience to reference.

I was raised Christian, and still bear the scars of phantom guilt and pretend reality. My kids were raised atheist, and tend to look to friends, books, logic and ""gut feelings"" when facing challenges.

Growing up is difficult, no question. But don't you find it curious that kids who have imaginary friends tend to be sent to therapy unless the imaginary friend is named god? A man on the corner having an extended conversation with himself is seen as being mentally ill ... but put that man in a church and let him have the same conversation while addressing his invisible friend as ""god"" or ""jesus"", and we think of him as spiritual and/or godly.

Over time as the posts on these words get buried by new content, this understanding requires substantial effort and patience, some of which well intentioned, intelligent people we would otherwise want in this sub will be unable or unwilling to put forth.

when you are letting fear run your life you begin to activate the fight or flight instinct and make impulsive decisions that often have terrible long-term consequences.  like others here, i would recommend counselling.  everyone has unique reasons for learning to act out of reactions to fear.    personal attention to how you've learned this behavior will likely help you rework it, which is how you gain control over your life."

* When the opponent has lethal on the board and I have nothing on my hand to prevent me dying, I concede. That way my enemy can't waste my time and I don't waste his time (And yeah there might be enemies who have the ""Deal X damage to other players"" Quest but frankly I can't care about everyone). I personally really dislike my enemy playing around if he has lethal. Just kill me and be done with it.

* When I have lethal on the board and my opponent has no way of stopping me I kill him as quickly as possible. There has been the occasional slip where I missed lethal and I just play my turn normally but I don't do it on purpose.

* When I win a game I wait for my opponent to say GG before I do it. Additionally when my enemy plays a very well thought out turn (nice combowork with the Rogue for example) he gets a Well Played as well."

I don't think it's as black and white as you may envision. I think that's something you need to figure out via experimentation. I suggest you go try whatever sounds fun to you and figure out on your own if you like it or not and what you'd like to sexually identify as.

&gt;3.I never fantasize about the male character. Do straight women fantasize about the male character?

I do, at least.

&gt;4.However I'm aroused by men's genitalia and the idea of being fucked hard. But the idea of soft loving sex with a man is not particularly appealing to me. It is just sex.

That might just be you finding a particular sex act more arousing than another.

&gt;7.I am not sexually aroused by the anatomy of a girls body but I think their beautiful. However if I love her, then I can be aroused.

I think female bodies are beautiful too.

&gt;8.Do you ever fantasize about pleasuring a guy because you really want to, because its arousing? Do you like the sounds they make? (I don't)

I think nothing is hotter than a male's moan/grunt/sigh during sex. Yes, I think about pleasuring a man because I want to. It's arousing, empowering, and fun for me. 

&gt;10.Do abs and a mans butt turn you on? Is it attractive to the point where you want to touch them? 

Abs and butts aren't my thing. I like teeth/smiles/lips and find those the most sensual parts. I also like hands/forearms and yes sometimes want to touch a man's arms just because I find it sexy.

etruscan,boardgames,1390490988.0,"I've had this conversation a few times lately both here and in the chat room. I'm in favour of luck in games, but I think that depends on you and your group. 

In my case, I play a lot of games with less experienced gamers (ie. muggles) who wouldn't play my games if they had no chance of winning. Playing **Bora Bora** with these people would happen once, end in tears, and never occur again. Playing **Alien Frontiers** also takes skill, but much of the game is based on the luck of your dice rolls. Sure, there are always good spots to use dice, and AF does a decent job of mitigating luck, but there are some rolls that are just better (or better timed!) than others. This is a game that my group will appreciate, have a chance at winning (even if this is their first time) and will want to play again.

Having said that, a lot of games that are luck heavy are also strategy heavy. **Dominant Species** relies a lot on luck, but luck won't save you in that game. The same could be said about a heavy euro like **Troyes** or an pure Ameritrash game like **Last Night On Earth**. All of these need some level of luck to win, but smart players will know how to mitigate the possibility of *bad* luck. "

Nike = ring of saturn satan in latin= little Zeus = Jesus = the black hole sun= black cube. Everyone takes their energy from the one true sun &amp; gives it to the black hole sun 24/7 via the ""cubes your biofield energy flows through"". You're doing it right now. You're a soul w/a body not a body w/a soul. this is not your first carbon 666 meet or last &amp; you're in the afterlife right now. Nobody needs to save you. Its that you need to unite peacefully out of worship of each other &amp; a common cause of survival. ""You do not fight for freedom you unite for it"". I worship you. I actually spilled my blood on it &amp; published video of it to my chan. Turns out to be the way out of the matrix prison you are held captive in. Nobody can escape earth. You must rise like cream above the nets cast around earth = raising your frequency above the nets ability to capture you. You can chose to spill your blood (pin prick a finger &amp; spiral tiny bit of blood reverse of the swastika, reverse of the clouds at N pole of Saturn). ""Spiral your blood Clockwise over your intent to worship all &amp; exclude none"". ""That You intend on Saving the universe out of your worship of those inside &amp; out of it by becoming &amp; teaching everyone how to become a super human inter dimensional being through sun gazing"" (see HRM protocol).

Everyone is cube to cube worship &amp; fails to worship each other at very least- thats in addition to your black cube worship. You do not plan on throwing away your black cubes of satan seen in all religions. Mecca = kabala black cube &amp; a Jesus cross = 2-D unfolded black cube &amp; Jewish men place black cube on arm &amp; head. Every game &amp; toy your kids touch is lego cubes, Mario cubes, Minecraft cubes, all gaming cubes, Cartoon net &amp; every other station boasts the cubes +symbols of Saturn = satan cubes, ring &amp; eye. You &amp; Everyone you know uses the Internet = NWO that tracks you &amp; makes you slave to satan absolutely; your biofield energy goes to the black hole sun 24/7. You speak black Magik spells over use of telepathy. You know its black Magik - simply reversing the speech of anyone auto-exposes lies/truth. Truth is built directly into your black magick speech -just reverse speech to expos lies. See the published vids of your president saying ""yes we can"" = ""thank you satan"". So if you are going to worship satan or your god = dog in reverse then you should be intent on worshiping everyone else also. Dog points to the Dog Star Serius the location our slave masters hale from. Spill your blood over your Intent &amp; publish video of it to the NWO =internet -Your youtube chan.

While we humans can be taught, culturally, to practice theory-of-mind empathy for strangers and those who aren't closely related to us, we will naturally feel this way about our direct relatives and our mates. So that kind of thought exercise is supposed to play on the natural instinct to empathize more strongly with a direct relative (mother, daughter) or a mate (girlfriend)."

ILoveBigOil,AdviceAnimals,1390491645.0,"&gt; But the difference in PPP between Canada and the US aside

You can't put this aside; it is the most important factor. Money is completely useless if you cannot buy things with it. 67,000 CND does not go as far as the equivalent in USD, even after adjusting for the exchange rate. This is all that matters. Because my after-tax dollars go further than yours do, you cannot equate our salaries without factoring that in. That is how taxes play into the financial picture, along with PPP.

&gt; I also think you'll find more regional variation within the US and Canada 

This is true, however, I took the US as a whole vs Canada as a whole to be able to equate these things. I do not have access to PPP statistics for individual cities in the US and Canada; if I were supplied these numbers I would be interested to see how they came out, although I can almost assure you they would be near identical on an apples-to-apples basis (i.e. not comparing Oklahoma City to Toronto, as that would be a bad comparison)

abeyante,AskWomen,1390491770.0,"&gt;so saying, ""wow, you're so thin"" (at least when I said it) was more an expression of admiration and respect than an insult, meant almost as a different way of saying, ""you're so pretty"" or ""I wish I looked like you.""


As a thin girl, I'll say that I know this, and this is exactly *why* these comments make my uncomfortable.

I absolutely hate hate *hate* it when women say things like, ""you're so thin, I hate you!"" or ""you're so pretty, I'm so jealous omg!"" or, god forbid, holy hell, ""I wish I looked like you."" Way to totally alienate me, drive a wedge between us, and create the most awkward elephant in the room ever. It's so awful to meet a woman and have her basically express extreme self loathing and insecurity and then project all that negativity onto me in one huge wave. It makes me feel bad for existing, for being around her, and for rubbing my physical presence in her face like I'm some personified reminder of her own baggage. As soon as someone comes out with something like this it's basically a screaming siren announcing that we can never be friends because this resentment will always be between us.

I know why it happens. I have horrible insecurities too. I've had an eating disorder for around 5 years now. When I meet beautiful, short, thin-yet-curvy, feminine women part of me is wailing inside about how I wish I looked like they do. But I would *never* say something like that aloud, especially not to the person in question. All it does it make them feel horrible about themselves and about how their very existence is hurting you.

I would ask if they minded if I sat at their table (didn't matter if they were alone or in a group) and would straight up let thm know how terrified I was lol. I'd just put it out there that I was trying to get over my social anxiety by talking to strangers. Sometimes they were put off, which actually gave me some practice in dealing with rejection, but a lot of the time they thought it was endearing and I had some fun, esteem boosting conversations. Once I was even propositioned (I chickened out and declined though lol).

Anyway, that was the first thing I did on my way to becoming a much happier, sexually and emotionally fulfilled person. Before that I was in a similar place as you. I think it wouldn't be a half bad idea for you to give this a shot as well.

AnyelevNokova,beyondthebump,1390492027.0,"Pharmacy worker here.

Go grab the tylenol for me: I'll wait. On the label, what does it say, *specifically*, in regards to age? Does it say ""Children's"" or does it say ""Infant's""? You should be able to find this on the front of the box. They're often placed in the same location, but the dosage will be different. If it says ""Children's"", *do not give it to your baby*. That's for kids 2 and up. My gut guess is that the ibuprofen is for infants, but the tylenol is for children.

The ibuprofen is ok as long as your girl is 6 months and up. It's not recommended for infants under 6 months because it can cause some nasty stomach irritation. We use the generic Infant Ibuprofen in our house with no issues.


As for the Tylenol, generally the ok starting point is at 3 months (your girl is old enough, so no issue there.) Go reread the label again very carefully and let me know what it says. Heck, if you can find the product listed online, link it and I'll check it out. But, like I said, my gut instinct is that doses for only 2 and up means it's not infant appropriate."

You can flop a flush draw and still make a straight without making a flush, but if the straight card is also a flush card, the flush trumps the straight.

You can't have a straight draw and then turn a flush, or have a card that completes a flush be trumped by a straight on the next street.

There are just more boards that can make a straight, and it's not uncommon for two players to be holding the same straight. Flushes can only be made on boards that have at least three of the exact same suit, and no two players will ever be able to make the same flush (with the exception of when all five board cards are ranked higher than the players' hole cards)."

TheEquivocator,relationships,1390492080.0,"OK, disclaimer first: I am no expert on relationships (or anything else in the world), so evaluate my advice on its own merits; don't take it as gospel.

A number of people are advising you to go with her to a professional therapist, and that makes sense, but perhaps it is not a practical option (*e.g.* she may not be receptive to going). In terms of talking to her yourself, then, this is how I would approach it if I were you.

My #1 priority would be to try to get her to let out her feelings. Like you said, it sounds like she's closing them off, and it's pretty much impossible to move past something if you are walling it off. To that end, I'd direct all my efforts to reassuring her:

1. that I love her and always have, and will not be put off by anything she says, critical of me or otherwise.

2. that I am aghast over the way I acted, and it's really important to me to make it right.

3. that the stupid things I said reflected utter thoughtlessness, but never, ever meant that I didn't love her, always.

4. I would try very hard to avoid giving her the sense that I wanted her to give something to me (*e.g.* telling me that it's OK).

5. Mostly, I'd try to say as little as possible. I would hold her and wait for her to speak, and if she didn't want to speak yet, I would still hold her and just say nothing. Touching is good. Touching is better than words at saying the simple things."
Geroy21,AskMen,1390492085.0,"You're probably right and to your point I'm willing to bet that she's mentioned this before too. Is it fine to talk about it? Sure. 

But she shouldn't bring it up every day or even frequently. She needs to make sure he understands where shes at and then sort her own shit out. If she  finds over time that she can't overcome her insecurities then she needs to bring it up again. But the onus is on her to deal with it, and having her unfounded insecurities constantly on his mind will not foster a healthy relationship. 

To put it more eloquently: communication is good, but don't shove it down his throat. She needs to proceed with caution, especially since there's really nothing he can do to solve her insecurities. "

Similarly, most of us ents who took the poll probably don't watch fox. The thing about the legalization of cannabis is that it doesn't really have groups that rise up against it, it's more likely to be individuals who just don't think it's a good idea. So when a behemoth group floods a poll in favor of legalization, it does unfairly skew the results. He even went on to say ""These things happen"" which makes it sound like he's not too upset.

ILoveBigOil,AdviceAnimals,1390492615.0,"From the article:

•Average credit card debt among indebted households: $15,263

•Average credit card interest rate: 14.95% APR

•Average mortgage debt: $147,591

•Average outstanding student loan balance: $31,646

•Average auto loan debt: $30,738

•Only 59 percent of Americans have at least $500 in a savings account saved

You can't be seriously using this as the basis for your argument...

A mortgage is asset-backed. It's not ""debt for nothing"". You get utility out of it. If you didn't have a mortgage you would have rent, except with a mortgage you eventually get to stop making payments and own the house outright; this doesn't happen with renting. Mortgages are smart financial instruments. The same is true with cars; additionally, you can't get to work, which is necessary to earn an income, in many places without a car, so a car is a necessity. If you didn't own a car you would rent one; again, ownership would allow you to eventually own the car outright and renting would not.

Student loans are there so you can get a degree and earn more; they pay for themselves the vast majority of the time and are excellent financial tools providing an opportunity for advancement. It is foolish to consider student loans a bad thing.

The only debt on this list that has any value whatsoever as a basis for your argument is credit card debt, and even this is skewed; that figure includes the cost of food, clothing, gas for your car to get to work, etc...**necessary things**.

Subtract these costs from the debt for an average American and then we'll talk."

hurston,changemyview,1390492662.0,"People are wary of fracking in the UK because of the problems with groundwater contamination.

The sale of the Royal Mail shares show that if the current government is not corrupt, it is at least incompetent. Even with such safety work, things are not entirely predictable and can go wrong.

Secondly, most of the companies starting fracking work are foreign, so even though there may be jobs in the short term, the profits will go overseas.

My biggest concern is that we grow too fast and end up in the same situation we were in with RPCC so a ""vetting process"" is a must.

In the same line of thought, what is a must to keep your status? Is 6 hours reasonable? I have a wife, 2 kids and a job and I still find ways to get my game on. As we grow, how do we let the leadership know that we won't be on much during a certain Clan War because my southern cousin is marrying a goat and I have to go to the wedding?  The more we lay out the structure now the less room for mistakes to occur later.

I will have to disagree with you on the mic stance though. Given the necessity for communication during objective games I would ask that we have that as a rule. Even if you fashion one out of your little sister's Hannah Montana karaoke machine and rubber bands, have it on.

So now that Zanook has crossed the river and held an audience with our Clan chiefs in a dark and moldy tent, what does that mean for us? I know that we are going to remain separate but should we create a RTry1 and 2?"

UnholyDemigod,TheoryOfReddit,1390492914.0,"I'm obviously biased, but I think everyone should be held to the same treatment. Kristen Bell made a post in /r/AskReddit to play 'would you rather', and we pulled that and told her to post it in /r/self, and she didn't take it badly at all IIRC. One of the things I love about reddit is that you can truly be judged by your words, and not yourself. With celebrity posts, it's obviously not going to be true all the time, although there are exceptions (let's get back to Rampart people), but I think mods should remain true to this policy of treating everyone the same. Of we give Arnold special privileges to flout the rules, then what's the line at which you're famous enough to get away with it? It'd become too blurry. Do you have to be a household name? Have a Wikipedia page? 'Reddit famous', like /u/Unidan? Of we started giving preferential treatment based on popularity of the person, a lot of people would start bitching that they should receive the same. If we start doing it based on popularity of the post, say if we don't notice a thread until it's reached frontpage and then we pull it, then people will start whinging that ""my post *could* become popular, you just didn't give it a chance"". At that point, why bother enforcing any rules at all? Go hard or go home is my philosophy when it comes to rules enforcement. Either pull everything that breaks the rules, no matter how many upvotes it has or who posted it, or don't pull anything at all.  "

Dantilli,IWantToLearn,1390493051.0,"To me reading IS instant gratification, so I often want to read more than anything else. If that isn't the case for you then you can't expect to want to read if you're giving yourself the free time to choose. 

Instead try timetabling it, decide a time in the day and timetable an hour of reading, make it into a habit. Maybe spend the last hour of your day in bed reading, that's what I used to do. 

If that becomes hard to stick to and you find yourself running out of time in a day, try making it the first thing you do. I've found that if you're struggling to keep a habit, if you make it the first thing you do in a day (after hygiene of course), you're much more likely to stick to it.

Failing all that, just use audiobooks more. Anytime you're involved in a task that you feel you can listen to an audiobook while doing, put one on. For example: if you're playing an rpg game you probably don't need the sound if you're not in a story section. So while you're grinding through enemies put on an audiobook and listen. Just make sure you have remotes next to pause the book and put the game sound on when you get to cutscenes.

If you like to play strategy games then that is the PERFECT opportunity to listen to an audiobook. Just imrpovise and use all the time you have

Hope this helps :)"

Without ascribing a gender to corporations, the relative percentage of power in the constituency by gender is unaffected - only the constituency's percentage of power in the total of political power. 

Lets use an example: 

Let us say there is a pie, and the pie is political power flavor. If we split the pie such that every person had even share (one vote per person) and there are 4 men and 5 women, then while every individual had the same amount of pie, women had the larger total share of the pie relative to men (56% to 44%) 

Now lets say we perform the same exercise expect we take half the pie and throw in the dumpster (corporations). Then we divvy up the other half to the same 5 women and 4 men. Now the dumpster has 50%, the women have 28% and the men have 22%. Now the women still have more pie than the men, but the genderless dumpster has more the the women.

Alternatively...

What is the grey loneliness?

&gt; mans

man's

&gt;to try to look thoughtful, tries to look anything but tired of the people and places around me, 

I would use to try or tries for both, not both forms.

&gt;the melancholy that comes with drinking on my own.

I'm thrown off by this.  This piece has been all about smoking, so I think that you should focus on smoking.

&gt;They tasted sharp and new and I felt like I owned them. I knew what I was doing, I was playing with them and I could put them down and pick them up. 

I've never smoked, but I've known many new smokers and I think you captured this new smoker feel pretty well.  However, you may want feedback from someone who smokes.

&gt;Now all I have is a pain in my chest and a pain in my heart.

A bit melodramatic, but I like it.

The entire Svalbard paragraph has some really lovely imagery.

I'm dubious of the description of cigarettes as ""packets of happiness"".  'Packets' makes me feel like we've moved on to a harder drug.

&gt;They tasted of adventure all the way to Basel where they began to taste sour, they began to taste like poverty as I spent my last few Francs on a pouch of tobacco, and they tasted of pain and loneliness as I waited for my money to come through.

Interesting.  I'd like to read more, perhaps you'll add a bit more about how the cigarettes contributed to the running out of money?  The only thing I'm not sure about is ""pain and loneliness""--for one, you used loneliness already, and two, it's just very generic.

Now, a pressure to be sexy and accomplished doesn't only apply to a person's self worth, it will also change the criteria by which many women base their choice of guys on.

The result is that not only do many guys feel that they're not good enough, as a cruel addition many girls will hold their choice of men to a higher standard as well. They know they have the benefit of the choice because men generally take the initiative, so they can envision themselves with a ""hotter"" guy and get away with it. They don't have to lower their standards to raise their success rate with guys, not to the same extent that men need to do.

My boyfriend has previously stated that my pubes are a complete non-issue but for me to feel sexy and comfortable I prefer to be somewhat hair free. I personally have sensitive skin also, and bumps on my mons if I shave too frequently etc. Solution for me: I shave my outer labia as the hair is finer and so does not irritate when I do it frequently and trim the top/shave it less regularly. As there's no hair where the actions happening the excuse/reason of 'I don't like hair in my mouth' isn't an issue.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1390493739.0,"Many of them have issues with confidence and/or self esteem. They see other people around them coupling up, with what looks like total ease, and compare that with their single life and assume it's just a lack of attraction from the opposite sex. The ones who do get around to asking women out, probably do so after a long process of avoiding it, long past where it would have been an opportune time or after too much self deprecation. Many others skirt around, leaving the subtlest of hints of their feelings for women, which they cannot possibly pick up on, then get hurt when the girl gives up on something that never goes anywhere. 

I used to be that way when I was in high school. I was too deep in my head, and looking back blew a lot of chances by not showing enough interest until it was way too late, and then coming on with a wave of pent up affection that honestly came off as much more unsettling and uncomfortable than ""romantic"". At first I disregarded the flirtation and cues that women were interested in me, since every time I sensed it and acted on it (as just described) the girl would not return my feelings. I attributed it to not being able to attract a girl, not my approach.

I think it took finally kissing someone (it was on vacation, so the short time helped prevent me from dragging any tension on too long) to begin to make me have confidence in those signals and that I am attractive to at least some females again. It still took another year after that to fully get out of those too deep parts of head when it came to approaching women, but I at least was on the right path. "

I'm not saying one affects the other; I'm saying you *have* to consider both when discussing the financial implications of living in one country vs another.

I never said they were correlated, but the are connected in that they contribute to the financial makeup of the country.

You must consider both when comparing two countries' financial situations; there is no other way.

SU also has a harsher curve. So, if you are looking to apply for jobs out of Washington, a UW gpa always looks nicer.

This to me explains and almost justifies the problem you describe where misogyny, racism, etc. have seemed to lose their real meaning.
But it hasn't.

They lose their meaning *in the context of those cultures*. If you're coming from outside and take them as what you know them to be, you're not accurately understanding the culture. If a Japanese person, who comes from a culture where one never wears shoes inside, were to come to the US and be disgusted by people wearing shoes in their houses, would they be in the wrong? Not really, because their cultural understanding denotes a certain meaning to that. Conversely, the American wouldn't be obligated to change their behavior. Navigating these kinds of scenarios requires a kind of cultural bilingualism that a lot of people don't have, but is necessary if you want to accurately comment on a community to which you don't belong. This situation is one of those scenarios, IMO.

&gt;But this does not for one second excuse the hatred and doesn't lessen the severity of this issue. At least that's my opinion.

I completely agree. I just believe that characterizing it as misogyny (which is a view that someone systematically holds, not a hat they put on when they feel like it) is hyperbolic and detracts from discussion by adding a component that sparks a strong emotional response in some people.

&gt;I suggest more than a week end.

Even their old Pop-y stuff was amazing, good pop is still good regardless of being pop. April 5th and Chameleon day off Color of Spring are 2 others I'd highly recommend and were the 2 that really showed what was coming for Talk Talk in their later albums, even the pop tracks show hints of the experimentation and instrumentation that would follow.

And if you like Talk Talk's ambient side you should definitely check out Mark Hollis's solo album he released after they split, probably one of the most melancholic, intimate albums of all time.

sautros,Smite,1390494109.0,"hey, if you want some general advice from an IT guru, you're more than likely suffering from overheating problems. if it's only while playing games/running videos that kind of thing, check that your graphics card fan is still spinning at a good speed or that it hasn't unseated slightly, most cards/motherboards will be designed to shut off once they reach a certain temperature, usually anywhere between the 70 and 90 degrees mark, 70 is very very low for a threshold, graphics cards should be able to operate up to the high 80's without any real risk. (sorry, I'm a UK guy. no idea what that is in Fahrenheit)

if you're feeling brave, play with the case side detached and then when it does cut out, try hovering your hand (DO NOT TOUCH. YOU WILL BURN) over the heat sinks for the graphics card and the processor, see which one's overheating. you may need to apply more thermal paste to the CPU heat sink connection or up the speed of your fans (some graphics cards have options for this, catalyst control center for AMD graphics can control fans) and you'll want to do this sooner rather than later to risk not burning out a vital PC component.

mmp31,counterstrike,1390494238.0,"1.5 was the best version of CS, hands down.  Valve ruined the game when 1.6 came out.  I posted this in another thread, but I feel like it's appropriate for this thread too, to explain why 1.5 is superior to 1.6.  Let me tell you why 1.6 sucks compared to 1.5.  (I'm not even going to bother commenting on every CS released after 1.6 because the game has turned into such a joke.)

They changed the hitboxes and gun recoil patterns around so that everything was more random. It had the effect of decreasing the skill of better players while elevating the skill of lower players to even the playing field a bit more. The one autosniper is BS because there's basically no recoil and does so much damage now...it did not used to be that way. The AWP didn’t used to have that delay between when you pull the bolt back and when you can scope again. It was a lot harder to avoid people who were good with AWP’s...again, this was a way of “leveling” the playing field by putting AWP users at a disadvantage. Can’t tell you how many times that delay has gotten me killed. To this day if I try to play CS, I am still not used to it.

I don’t like how the round clock now stops after the bomb is planted. It slows the pace of the game down because the rounds can be 30-45 seconds longer. It also changes the balance of power more in favor of the T’s. I also think it’s pretty lame that the person who planted the bomb has their score go up if the bomb detonates. It makes the player score less meaningful for determining how good another player is.

They changed the buy menus so that they’re in order of price, which is so illogical. For example, the AK47 used to be #1 on the rifles menu for terrorists, which made way more sense. I think AWP is #5 on the rifles for T’s and #6 for CT’s? So confusing, and always causes me to buy the wrong gun. You also can't buy a gun that you already own, so if you want to buy the same gun for someone on your team, you have to drop yours first. Slows the game pace down.

You used to be able to hit tab and click on someone’s name to mute them. Good luck muting obnoxious people in the middle of a round in 1.6. Again, makes the gameplay slower. I think they also may have changed around the damage that weapons do in a way that I and a lot of others found unfavorable, but I might not be remembering that correctly. They added the riot shield which is cheesy IMO. I also didn't care for the new guns they added (Defender and Clarion) because again it fucked with the balance of power.

I don't like the new gun skins but that's obviously cosmetic. Who the hell runs with a knife pointing straight up? So cheesy. That knife looks pretty lame too, compared to the 1.5 knife. The guns used to have real names and then they made them fake names which is also cheesy. I don’t like the 1.6 versions of Aztec and Inferno. The text fonts in 1.6 look horrible compared to the fonts in 1.5 which looked more professional.

One of the big issues was that when Steam first was released, it was garbage. There were a shitload of bugs and nothing ever worked properly. When Valve started talking about Source, I realized that they were just never going to make CS 1.6 right, so I stopped caring about the game. I tried to play 1.6 about 5 years ago but I gave up because the server list has obviously been hacked and I couldn’t find any decent servers. So apparently, after a year or two of ruining that game, Valve ALSO decided they didn't give a shit about it anymore either and stopped updating it.

With how fast computers are today, this is probably a moot point, but 1.5 runs so much faster than 1.6. And the gameplay is a lot slower for several reasons that I pointed out. Coupling those two together makes 1.6 feel bloated and slow. Don’t get me wrong, there were some bug fixes that they did in 1.6 that I found favorable. But the bad far outweighed the good and it just made the game not as fun as it used to be.﻿"

PracticalDemonkeeper,TwoXChromosomes,1390494298.0,"There seems to be a dichotomy where anti-choice supporters split abortions into two categories: righteous abortions and bad abortions. Righteous ones are the ones that can't simply be avoided because of a medical problem making pregnancy so dangerous that it might kill both the mother *and* the fetus before or during childbirth, or a pregnancy caused by a rape/incest. The bad abortions seem to be anything other than those two categories, including economic reasons, being unprepared for pregnancy, not *wanting* to have a child, or going on vacation and wanting to drink.

You're so right that it really shouldn't matter why a woman chooses to have an abortion because her own reason is reason enough for her. It's cruel to legislate and effectively force someone carry a pregnancy to term when they don't want to, and if they don't want to then you can't ever *make* them want to, no matter how many laws you write or how many bible verses you quote. It's already enough of a volatile subject without political opponents trying to categorize the reasons for having an abortion into ones that are acceptable enough for *them* to make an exception for and still be able to sleep at night and ones that aren't good or moral enough to consider."

Plenty of rich men with too much money simply want to provide for their wife because they can. They think it's silly for her to have to work if she won't be adding much to their money pool. They have the means to support their spouse and it's between them! Often, these women make charities their new ""job"" and become amazingly hard working philanthropists. The men and women still love each other just as much as a poor couple does. 

Sure, there are the relationships where it's practically contractual prostitution. But that, I feel, is rarer than you would think. You see tons of relationships where rich old men have their slightly younger wives that have been married to them for 20+ years. 

This isn't a choice I would make for myself. The only time I could possibly see it is if my health problems made my life more difficult than it does already. And at that point, I would throw myself wholeheartedly into giving back to the community and finding a way to make my life valuable and worthwhile.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390494461.0,"&gt;Let me suggest that labels like ""reform"" and ""conservative"" encompass large swaths of a spectrum, 

Agreed. 

But that means people should be able to place themselves on that spectrum. And I don't personally see how you can do so without understanding your affiliated movement's starting point. ""Conservative changes this part of the Aleinu because of this. I don't really like it because that messes with the well established liturgy we've had forever and means we're not saying the same prayers as a people.""

Alternatively, that's also why labels like ""Conservadox"", ""Just Jewish,"" ""non-denominational,"" ""Reformative"" ""somewhere in between Reform and Reconstructionist"" have sprung up. I'm not arguing that labels are perfect, just that they're the best of the bad tools we've got.

&gt;and not everyone will feel comfortable defending - or have the knowledge to defend - every single belief of a movement, and that's okay. 

Not feeling comfortable 100% of the time is understandable. And not having the knowledge to defend - to say I don't know - is honest and commendable. What's not okay in my mind is to then say ""well, that means I don't have to go learn about this topic sometime because whatever we do I'm sure is just great, no matter why we do it!"" That's willful ignorance.

&gt;There's a big difference between, say, not being able to articulate the rationale behind a personal practice or belief and not being able to explain each and every responsum of a particular movement.

I get ""I can't explain the lure of lighting Shabbat candles. Just gives me the warm fuzzies."" I get ""I do it despite being atheist because it connects me to my ancestors and Jewish people everywhere."" I get ""I light candles with my synagogue during Kabbalat Shabbat services instead of at home because it makes me feel really good when we do communal prayer and ritual."" Those are all personal reasons for personal practices.

But just like I can't respect the position of a say, a self-proclaimed Chicago school economist who hasn't read the position and theories of the Chicago school AND what other economists say about their own theories and about Chicago school.

I don't see how I can respect the position of a religious member -any one, not just Jewish- who says ""I'm X but don't know what X says about Y, and why they say that!"" And then, even more frustrating to me, when asked about Y, or offered to learn about what group Z says about Y, is uninterested or unwilling to learn about Y. That's called laziness.

&gt;I don't think it's fair for you to have less ""respect"" for me because I can't articulate the bases for those additions...

Unfortunately, or fortunately, we aren't all forced to have the same opinions on everything. You think that's unfair. I hear you on that.

So can you hear me that I don't see how you can object to those additions unless you know a)that there are additions/changes b) why they were made in the first place. I think it's one thing to go ""ugh, just doesn't work for me..  and never get to the why of ""why doesn't it work for me?"""

AnyelevNokova,beyondthebump,1390494488.0,"The reason I asked about the packaging is because the mg/ml concentration of infant tylenol was standardized a couple years back to be the same concentration as children's. The old dosage for infants was much more concentrated (80mg/0.8 or 80/1.0). She said her mother brought it over for Christmas, so it's extremely unlikely that she's using the old dosage. The package is a reliable way of knowing which one she has in her hands because it **will** state which age range it's for: legally, it has to. Knowing the mg/ml concentration will be irrelevant, as it should be 160mg/5ml for both infants and children.

As I said before, the dosage chart as she described it suggests to me that she's holding a box of Children's Tylenol, but when all else fails, look at the front. Another way of knowing which one you're holding is the dosing method: OTC infant's is delivered by syringe, while children's can be delivered by tablet or suspension in a cup. It *can* be delivered by syringe, but I don't see it packaged OTC with one anymore because it's ineffective past 2 or 3 years.

And under 2, it does indeed go by weight.

And [here](http://www.knowyourdose.org/sites/default/files/CHPA_Pediatrics_DosingChart_FINAL%5B1%5D.pdf) is a standard dosage chart that lists all the dosages (old and new conc's for infants and standard for children.) "

3.  You can ask your wedding party however you want.  We simple called everyone we want involved and they all accepted.  Some people go all out, but it's really up to you and your personalities.

Crabtree's push is quite a stretch to call it *violent*. This isn't a trent williams situation.

There's quite a bit of hypocrisy in ""heat of the moment"" defenses to Sherman but I don't see many granting Crabtree the same sentiment.

Few are talking about the entire scenario. Crabtree is aware of the meaning of the play that just happened and is walking to the sideline...probably about 3/4 way there.

They think that I'm basically just a drag queen or cross dresser who took it really far so that I could trick men into having sex with me.

SparkitusRex,Dachshund,1390495018.0,"It does look like it could be a pinched nerve or some other spinal issue. The good news is if he's still walking, you may be able to fix it with medication and something like water therapy, rather than having to resort to surgery. Be extra careful and monitor his poop amounts. If he has a pinched nerve it may cause his bowels to not work as well and he'll get backed up. If he gets constipated enough it's really painful.

I had a dachshund who had similar symptoms (as well as the backed up poo) and we were able to fix his issues with just muscle relaxers, pain meds, and water therapy. He was about 6 at the time and he's still going strong 5 years later with no real relapse. Mind you, the healing process took months and it got much worse (he lost back leg function entirely for about a week) before it got better. See what the vet says but stay positive.

If you're not interested in making an impact on people around you, you could just have fun while you're here. Maybe you could try taking the fact that we'll all be forgotten eventually as a comfort. For example, if you're self conscious about something, you can remember that eventually it won't matter. You're right, nothing really matters because we'll be forgotten once we're gone, and that's a frightening thought. But quite frankly, the universe doesn't give a shit about us now either. We just happen to be billions and trillions of molecules that prefer to be in certain positions, and amazingly, we can see, smell, and understand the world around us, even to the point of fearing our own death. This is an amazing thing, and we're going to be here while we're here. 

As far as impact goes, I always thought it was humorous that the entire reason many people call Native Americans ""Indians"" is simply that when people got to America for the first time, they thought they were in India!

Sure, Columbus(o) made an impact by finding the Americas and he's mentioned in history books, but the biggest impact (IMO) is his impact on our colloquial (American English) language."

ILoveBigOil,AdviceAnimals,1390495256.0,"I completely agree with you that people shouldn't spend outside of their ability to pay. No argument there.

&gt; if their monthly obligation for this amount decreases, without a change in spending habits, they'll just keep spending and their monthly obligations will stay the same.

This is not true across the board. It comes down to taking responsibility for your own financial future; if you choose not to make the right choices you will find yourself in financial ruin and have no one to blame but yourself, and I will have no empathy for you. You made your bed, now lay in it.

My analogy is spot on. The fire is what is important right now. Who cares about what you *should* have done...you can't go back and change it. What matters is now. Now you have debt that you can't afford because of the interest. Fix that. Refinance at a lower rate. That puts the fire out.

If you reduce the ""fuel"" on the fire, it will still burn; it just won't necessarily grow. There are two ways to put out a house fire: Extinguishment (water, CO2, etc) or letting the house burn down. I'd rather not let my house burn down. I'd rather put it out and still have some left to salvage.

Fixing the immediate threat (loan interest) is what is important right now. After you do that, fix what caused the threat in the first place (spending habits). If you say ""I won't light the carpet on fire next time!"" that doesn't extinguish the fire that's blazing at this moment."

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1390495337.0,"there is no ""correct"" answer to these questions.

going from dating (does anyone besides me actually date anymore?) to sex for me is usually 2-3 dates. real dates. dinner. a movie. a concert. spending quality time getting to know the other person.

sex to exclusiveness is dependent on well i feel i connect with the person. i've done it within days of having sex to as long as a month or more. but that's me. i want to make sure that we both want the same thing. that said, i am pretty much exclusive once i start dating someone, but i take your question to be the ""let's talk about our relationship"" and the ""i want us to be exclusive"" talk.

to me ""exclusive"" means boyfriend. or maybe boyfriends means exclusive? i usually call the guy i am dating my bf once we get to the exclusive talk.

bf to engaged - hasn't happened yet for me, but my best guess is 3 to 6 months minimum.

engaged to husbands - the time span required to plan a wedding. so dependent on where you live, that may mean travel to another state, inviting guests, making arrangements. a year? easily. if the state allows gay marriage, why wait? head to the courthouse and celebrate with friends and family later.

married to kids - if you want kids. that is a huge, huge, *fucking huge* commitment. don't go into that without a lot of thought and planning. fortunately gays can't just ""get pregnant""! if you are serious about having kids *and* your spouse is, i'd still say wait 3 to 4 years. make sure that your relationship is strong enough to handle the extra stress. don't ever, *ever* try to do what straights do and have a kid to ""save"" your marriage because that shit never works. you just end up with 2 adults who are miserable together or a divorce, and either way the kid is stuck in the middle of it.

there you are. my thoughts. YMMV."

This was posted last year. Basically a lesbian couple wanted to have a kid and ran a Craigslist ad. The male showed up and did his thing. Now the happy couple has a kid and all is right with the world.

Then one of the two women get disabled and they have to go on public assistance. Naturally, the state looks to the biological father for assistance. This would/should happen every time. It is irrelevant that the couple is gay. It is irrelevant that the male has nothing to do with the child or family.

If you impregnate a person, you should be on the hook for child support. This is no different than any other random bar/craigslist hook-up.

KeepSantaInSantana,funny,1390495516.0,"I was part of the church for several years.  While they're not all intolerant, a huge majority of them are.  I traveled for retreats, worked at a couple church camps with ~200 visitors a week, went to conferences, went ""soul winning"", visited various friends churches....I've met thousands upon thousands of Christians during the years I was one.  They teach intolerance, it's in the basic message.  The good churches that teach love and acceptance are far and few between.  They teach how to fake acceptance while ultimately trying to change someone/win someone over.  Near every church's basic teaching when only seasoned members are there, is about the importance of sharing the message/converting people, and if someone doesn't want to hear it *theyre* the ones being intolerant.





I can also tell you that the people who hate Christians the most are Christians.  It is ridiculous how much of a battle there is between baptists/Lutherans/brotherans/Methodists and so on.  I went to an independent baptist church once and they prayed for the southern baptists for being ""so close"" to knowing the truth but apparently still being far enough to go to hell.



Now don't get me wrong, I have a great many friends who are Christian and very loving/accepting, but I've been to their churches and can tell you that even in their groups, they're the nicest of the bunch.




Since I've been part of the church before I know how to behave at one.  I know the bible very well, I can follow along with the message and find the book/chapter they're in quickly, I can appear as a Christian.  Lots of hate spewed.  Lots and lots and lots.  And the unfortunate thing is, they don't see it that way.  They think they're being tolerant.  My biggest problem with Christianity is that the bible can be interpreted in so many ways but people are told to listen to the random guy at the front of the church.  If he tells you god meant this and you think differently, you're discouraged from arguing or showing your opinion because you're wrong.  There is even a verse in the bible that speaks about not trusting your instincts if they go against what the bible says, because it's Satan tempting you.  They discourage free thinking."

IngwazK,TumblrInAction,1390495601.0,"Id call that attempting to get the least harmful outcome out of a very ugly situation.  Assuming youre not familiar with derpgate, many episodes ago, derpy, who was largely seen as a fandom character and little more than an easter egg, was given a full speaking role.  Personally, i think it was great, but it was also flawed.  This is an instance where the show staff outright tried to pander to us, and it ended very poorly.  Derpy's voice was masculine sounding and sounded as if she was a bit slow, her clumsiness was played up a lot, and she was constantly doing really stupid stuff.  Add in her eyes, and i can see how people would jump to the conclusion that she was a mentally and physically disabled character and that since it was done so over the top, that it was a bit unintentionally offensive.  Needless to say, people freaked out.  The episode was removed from itunes for 3 weeks i think, and when it returned it was heavily edited.  Derpy's eyes, thst which made her unique, had been ""fixed"" almost completely, her voice changed (not necessarily for the worse), and her name had been entirely removed.  People were very upset on both sides.  To many, derpy was a mascot of sorts.  Something uniquely fandom and show canon at the same time.  To those who were offended, it was a jab at the physically and mentally disabled.  Lots of people were fighting with each other, the show staff were dragged into the debacle in some ways, and the whole thing just couldnt be put to rest.  After that, any newly created episodes purposefully did not have derpy in them.  It wasnt until the season 3 finale that derpy was actually seen, as a sort of sign that she hadn't been removed entirely.  9 months later, season 4 begins and derpy is nowhere to be seen again.  It's not until s4e09 (the one you mentioned) that derpy finally reappears.  This time, her eyes were as they used to be, but she did not speak.  They had made derpy back into what she was originally.  A background character who acts as more of an easter egg.  Does this make either side completely happy? No, but you never will.  What it does donis give both sides something that they wanted and helps to calm both sides.  Was derpy's usage in that particular episode aimed more towards bronies?  Most likely.  However, i suggest that it was done specifically that way not only to show bronies that derpy had not knky not been removed, but fo clearly show that she would be returning more in her original capacity and to help placate the bronies specifically, since before that it was the side who had taken offense that had only gotten any real fix to their issue.  This way, both sides win to some extent.  When both sides are, for the majority, neutral with the outcome, youre likely to retain both sides' brand loyalty.  

So, i wouldnt call it fan pandering, but a smart business move.  I would also like to point out that this particular instance is a rarity, and i cannot actually think of any others.  Can you?

It's an opportunity to build up legal precedents for performing an abortion apart from a woman's consent.

Roe v. Wade said that if a fetus is nonviable then the state has no interest in interfering with an abortion.

And time is ticking away. Roe also cited 24-28 weeks as the viability watershed. (On the basis of 40-year-old medicine, but the law is the law.)

And guess what, the attorneys avoided saying whether this fetus is viable.

No, it's a test case. That's why certain information is being strategically revealed and certain information is being strategically withheld."

frackaracka,AskWomen,1390495678.0,"My ex-bf was an opera singer. I'm in my early/mid-twenties, he was in his mid-twenties.

I had a full-time job and was making more than him, and at the time I was fine with it. I used to even give him gifts of things he couldn't afford by himself with no expectation that they would be reciprocated.

But, it was very clear that we were used to different lifestyles, and we were at very different points in our lives. I've diligently saved 10-25% of every paycheck I've made and  as a result I have a tidy nest egg; he was living paycheck to paycheck and had no savings to speak of.

He did work hard and there is absolutely no shame in that. But I do have desires to have a family one day, and when I do, I want a partner who can contribute as much to the pot for our children's education and standard of living as I do. Unfortunate as it is, we live in an economy that forces families to bring in two incomes - and if I want my children to have the same opportunities I had growing up, then it's absolutely necessary for both my partner and I to bring in the dough.

That's not to say he has to be making as much as I do, but if he's being paid significantly less than I am, I can see that causing stress in the relationship down the road. On top of that I am a very ambitious person, and I am attracted to ambitious people. Financial stability is important to me. Being partnered with a less-ambitious, financially unstable person like my ex was a source of stress. I found it increasingly harder to be attracted to him.

So the answer is no, I personally would not. But that's because I have goals and aspirations that may make me fundamentally incompatible with someone who enjoys a low-paying career. Other girls may very well be fine with it, but my relationship experience has shown me that I am not one of them."

Don't like it, don't watch it. There's tons of porn that I don't enjoy viewing, but it's there for those who do, not just me.

_____________________________________________________________________________

If you're a porn actress, you should do some research on the company you're about to work with, I can only assume she knew what to expect for this shoot, before she even arrived. 

Also she was completely safe, most porn companies will do just about anything to ensure their porn actors feel safe, it's a thing in the industry, they don't want to be accused of anything that will tarnish their reputation. 

I think (not sure if this is the same producers, seems like it is tho) this site does interviews before and after, someone might want to find that, and we can hear what she has to say about it.

__________________________________________________________________________________

edit: you said something about boys and girls who watch this video. If I'm correct, you should be an adult before you're allowed to watch porn.

__________________________________________________________________________________

Edit #2: fuck it bros, ill be your expert today.

So I did some [research](http://www.kink.com/k/model/33781-Aria-Aspen.html), turns out she worked with [kink](http://www.kink.com/), which specializes in [humiliation](http://www.kinkondemand.com/kod/shoot/14918-Beauty-in-the-Bar.html), [bondage](http://www.kinkondemand.com/kod/shoot/20850-Hot-22year-Candy-Striper-Stripped-and-Fucked-with-Medical-Machines.html), and [rough play](http://www.kinkondemand.com/kod/shoot/19595-Tattooed-Hottie-is-Made-to-Submit-to-Five-Guys.html) porn. [boundgangbangs.com](http://www.boundgangbangs.com/site/?c=1) is one of the subsidiaries for Kink, and if you visit their main page, before you even agree to enter, they adertise as **Extreme** Gangbang videos. Point being, if she didn't want to get roughed up, she shouldn't have signed up to work for a company who plainly advertises as Extreme. 

and like I said before, she could have stopped them at anytime, I'm sure that may have brought up issues with payment, but the option to stop was always there for her.

delanthaenas,DestructiveReaders,1390495865.0,"Well, I tried.  And you're right, it is offensive.  If something is going to be satire, you need to make it evident in the text, you can't just cram in a bunch of ridiculous stuff and expect your audience to assume.  Right now I don't feel like you understand patriarchy or feminism well enough to satirize, and you just come off looking like a crazy redpiller.

Satire is achieved by treating your subject matter seriously, which I don't feel you do.  I feel like I'm expected to laugh, and that makes me think you're serious.  Also in satire, you may interject wry comments here and there, to establish that it is satirical.  Consider the following opening line from Pride and Prejudice:

""It is a fact universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.""

Is this true?  Probably not; it's a sweeping generalization made on an entire group of people, but for the purposes of the story it's going to be held as truth.  If I were going to open A Modest Proposal in a similar fashion, I might say the following:

""It is a fact universally acknowledged, that all the nutrients needed to sustain the human body may be found within the human body.""

So my suggestion to you, OP, is revisit your subject material, learn more, and try again.  Also, always keep in mind what you're really trying to say.  "

Even ""pre-screen"" functions like Winky only start an action, which spawns the screen to light. 

That's why I'm saying all this speculation comes from people who don't understand how it works. Once you've worn it for a bit, you quickly see how all of those theories hold no water at all. 

Relevant: I'm one of the founders of an early Glass dev/blogging team. We've torn the OS and functionality to pieces with experimentation.

I'm actually split right down the middle (as in the differences, my parents are together) - my mom's side is all really close, and we all have a great relationship.  I hang out with my cousins just like any other friends, and my sister and I are super close.  On my dad's side, he had a big falling out with them (they're all sort of toxic people), so we don't ever see/talk to them.  If I talk about either, especially out of context (which I think is the important part), then it may sound bad either way, but I'm not *making* it sound bad.  It's all how the person takes it.  My mom's side could sound like I'm obsessed with my family, and my Dad's like I hate family and don't get along with anyone.  It's best left alone in the beginning.

Have you ever kept up with a show and checked the discussion on any other subreddit?  I usually watch the show the day after it airs, but then I immediately go on the subreddit discussion to see what they have to say.  I usually miss something, or I just get some cool perspectives.  Community, for example, is an incredibly clever show. There are usually a few really subtle things that I miss, and people always mention them in the discussion, so I end up enjoying the episode even more!  I'd recommend it!

Interesting article, but there is *so much* wrong with it.  Worst online profile ever?  Not even close.  First mistake:

&gt;Reed used the real photo of her model friend

Model?!  She used a model for the *worst* profile?!  Does she know what that word means? 

Also, if you want the worst profile of a woman, then I man has to make it.  First off, if she's that attractive, some of the guys aren't even going to care what she says.  Seriously - hell, some will be happy that she's that insane because if they get a meet, maybe they'll get to sleep with her and then dump her anyway. The profile *does* say that she's interested in casual sex.  And really, it seems too obvious - this is the epitome of the stereotype she's attempting to portray.   It's trying too hard - I'd message her and go along with whatever just because it would be hilarious.  

If you want the worst profile ever, use someone that's not attractive but make the profile appeal to the guido/douchebag type.  There probably isn't even a demographic that would be interested in that.  I'd be surprised if there were a single positive message to that profile."

drzoidburger,PickAnAndroidForMe,1390496021.0,"I have a Moto X and absolutely love it. Wouldn't leave it for any other phone in the world right now. When I got my phone, I was in the same boat you were in. The Nexus 5 was attractive, but I was getting a ""free"" or discounted phone with my AT&amp;T upgrade anyway, so I figured I might as well use it. Addressing some of your concerns with the Moto X, there is actually an option in settings that lets you use Touchless Controls even if you have a screen lock. I have my phone set to that, and I can make calls, send texts, and use Google Now using Touchless Controls without having to unlock my phone. If I try to do anything else after that, it will prompt me for my lock pattern. I think this was a feature added on in 4.4, so older reviews where the Moto X was still running Jellybean might not be aware of it. Also, Active Notifications is amazing. You can approximate it on the Nexus 5, but it will be a drain on the battery, since the N5 has a LCD screen instead of the X's AMOLED (Active Notifications takes advantage of the fact that AMOLED screens only need to turn on when displaying non-black colors). I also don't know where you got the idea that the Moto X doesn't have a Gorilla Glass screen because it does.
      
      
There are a lot of other cool features on the Moto X that I find myself using every day. I'm in class right now, and Moto Assist has automatically silenced my phone since it knows from my calendar that I'm busy. Moto Connect is sending me texts from my phone to Chrome on my laptop (other apps can do this too, but Motorola makes it easier to set up). If I need to take a quick picture of a slide, I can twist the phone a few times and the camera activates. 
      
The N5 is not that much bigger than the Moto X, but the Moto X has a slightly curved back and a dimple that makes it more comfortable to hold and use. While it's smaller than other phones on the market these days, the screen is actually pretty large because of the on-screen home and back buttons. 
        
I don't know much about unlocking bootloaders, but I suggest posting in /r/motox about it. Whichever phone you pick, I guarantee you'll be happy. They're both great phones, both at the front of the pack right now. Let me know if you have any more questions about the Moto X."

&gt;Thun's team estimates that in the later ACS study, a rate of 17 out of 100,000 lifelong nonsmoking men per year died of lung cancer, compared with nearly 15 per 100,000 women who were lifelong nonsmoker

This means you have 0,015% chance to die of lungcancer if you don't smoke. Secondhand smoke will increase this by 20%* if you live with someone who smokes around a pack a day in the house, 17% if you work in a place where people smoke a lot. So 1,2 x 0.015% = 0,018% chance of getting lungcancer if you don't smoke but live with someone who smokes a lot.

So living with your boyfriend and passively smoking the entire day for the rest of your life, will give you around 0,003% more chance to develop lungcancer. I am not sure what the percentage is if you are in a room where he smoked a cigarette earlier, but I doubt that it's much either. 

I don't think you have an increased risk if he kisses you and there's just the smell and no actual cigarettesmoke. If you do have an increased risk, it will at least be less than 0,003%.

I wouldn't worry too much.

SublethalDose,socialskills,1390496058.0,"It would depend on what they were doing wrong, but probably the first thing I'd do, before giving them specific advice, would be to cue them to pay attention without freaking out.  (Some people don't pay attention.  Some people freak out.  Sometimes I manage to freak out without paying attention to the thing I'm freaking out about.)  Depending on the situation, I might have to direct their attention to an important aspect of the situation that they're overlooking.  Honestly, for real life, I think that would be a huge help.  Many simple day-to-day mistakes are caused by over-arousal and misdirected attention.

On a side note, I was always a little bit creeped out by the Half-Life 2 expansion episodes.  The hot female sidekick went from being just normal video game exploitation (let's build a world completely devoid of women and add one super hot chick to be your sidekick!  but she's smart and ""strong"" so it's not sexist!) to being overly supportive and validating.  She constantly tells you how great you are in an exaggeratedly caring, reassuring voice.  Like a kindergarten teacher for grown-ups... grown-ups who still miss their kindergarten teacher.  The reason this post reminded me of that was that at the time I called the Half-Life 2 expansions ""a therapy tool for sexually frustrated autistic social rejects.""

Going heavy into Air is only viable for Scepter builds because of the fact that Scepter benefits from having more damage in Air (Air #2) and resetting the CD (using Air #2 some more and synergy with Air 15, the instant nuke). D/D has no reason to go back into Air because we have no skills we'd want to fire off at that time.

D/D in WvW is based around Water + Arcana because they are significantly better traits for the playstyle. They give you sustainability, Condition removal and a large amount of Healing. Your gear should reflect the damage portion.

emk2203,europe,1390496168.0,"My point is simply that

&gt;A lot of manufacturing is done by British companies too, such as Jaguar, Land Rover, Rolls Royce, Bentley etc.

isn't true, regardless of the manufacturing site. From the Wikipedia entry of [Rolls-Royce Motor Cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Motor_Cars):

&gt; Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW AG established in 1998 

Now please tell me how a wholly owned subsidiary of a German company can be British.

Be happy that you have the manufacturing capacity in the UK, don't delude yourself. By the way:

UK car production 2004: 1,647,246 - the 1,500,000 units you are boasting about for 2012 are a *decline* of -9% in the last 8 years.

There are a lot of reasons to be proud of being white, there are also a lot of reasons why white people (generally, historically speaking) are total dicks. Just as there are a lot of reasons to be proud of being any ""colour"" (collective achievements, overcoming opposition/oppression etc.) and reasons to be not so proud (long histories of gender/religious oppression, attempted genocides, long-term cultural stagnation or instability etc.).

Just because I can be proud to be what I am, doesn't mean that I necessarily have to be proud at the expense of others, which tends to be my impression of the ""pride"" movements in general."

Right. This is where the disconnect comes in. Baptism appears to be modeled after something whose primary function has nothing to do with what baptism does."

Continuing to use a very viable character that fits very well within the story and happens to be popular, doesnt automatically make it pandering.

Skulder,Denmark,1390496574.0,"I have a clarification for that recipe.

&gt; As soon as they get bubbly around the edge, turn them quickly  
 Continue cooking, turning the ball to keep it from burning.

You pour in the batter, and wait for it to make a crust, and you turn it, when you can do so, without the crust collapsing. The batter that's still liquid inside, will fall down and create the other half. Optimally, you won't need to turn it again after that.

That means that the firm edge should be around 1/3 towards the centre. Approximately.

Oh, and they should be done in butter. No substitutes allowed."

puppydog_smiles,AskReddit,1390496873.0,"I will start by saying that any cosmetic/plastic surgery should be your choice - made *for* you and made *by* you.  I have not personally had any procedures done, but my best friend had 3 babies (the youngest is now 6).  She also lost 80 pounds shortly after that pregnancy and has kept it off for at least 5 years now.  She is scheduled for a tummy tuck and liposuction and the anticipated outcome is [this](http://www.nycosmeticmd.com/photo-gallery/details.cfm?ID=46&amp;StartRow=11) NSFW before &amp; after.  The before is probably the closest thing to her body I could find.  In a couple of years she also plans to have a breast lift and implants.  I can tell you that she is beyond excited for the surgery and her surgery date is Feb 4th.  

I can also tell you that my group of friends and I have done a lot of research on it.  Several of them have breast implants and are very happy with them.  I think the happiness and self-esteem issue depends on why an individual chooses to have the surgery.  For instance, someone who has always had small breasts may react differently than a woman who had large breasts, breastfed, and then lost volume and perkiness (my friend mentioned above went from a D pre-kids to a very saggy B after breastfeeding, and the plastic surgeons all said if they only did a lift, she barely has enough breast tissue left to fill an A, if that).  

You did not mention how long it has been since you reached your goal, and from what I've read, it can take up to a year for your body to ""bounce back"" after massive weight loss or pregnancy, so if it hasn't been that long, you might want to wait and see.

Pour le tester, essayer simplement d'appeler votre téléphone après l'avoir placé dans un tel engin.

Bien sur, vous pouvez aussi simplement le fermer, mais si vous êtes un peu paranos et croyez les rumeurs voulant que les fournisseurs et autres seraient quand même capables d'activer vos téléphones à distance (notez que les téléphones intelligents n'ont pas de ""switch"" off mais seulement un fonction de veille profonde), c'est une couche de sécurité de plus."

But anyway, I don't think contact every single day is *necessary*, but that doesn't mean I don't.  My SO and I usually talk on and off through gchat throughout the day - not for the sake of talking, but maybe something happened we wanted to share, or we're making plans for something.

I don't have a problem going a day without talking, but we usually tend to talk anyway because it just works out that way.  I certainly wouldn't see any reason to be annoyed, but that doesn't mean everyone is like that.  If you want to talk to him, just tell him it's important to you, and it doesn't even have to be much.  One of my friends used to call his girlfriend (now wife) or vice versa every night when they weren't living together just to say good night.  Whenever I was there for that conversation, it usually lasted all of 2 minutes, but they still got their contact for the day.  Maybe you could have something like that - whoever goes to bed first calls the other to say goodnight, and you have your contact and he doesn't feel like he's keeping tabs on you by calling all the time.

NeonGreenTV,TumblrInAction,1390497217.0,"As a bisexual male, I don't even identify as bisexual anymore because I know that it'll ruin my chances with women. I hide it because yes, there is hate towards bisexual men and women. You reveal that you're bisexual to a woman who's not open, and your chances of a relationship are pretty much over.

They think we're distrustful, sexually promiscuous, diseased, or we're just gay men in denial. I don't want to fuck everyone at once, I want a monogamous relationship. It's just like being straight or being gay. If a straight guy is in a relationship, he can sleep around with other women (cheat) too. If a gay man is in a relationship, he can sleep around with other men too. Same with lesbians, and straight women. But they think since we're bi, we want to both at the same time. 

And I have a female lean, so I'm not too bent up about it. I don't have any problem just being with a woman because I want biological children anyway. Plus I fear for my safety. 

But I'v seen bisexual hate a lot of times. Some lesbians who don't like bisexual women, some gay men who don't like bisexual men. But I've known lesbians that are I feel are rightfully mad dealing with women who aren't really lesbians but want to be trendy. These lesbians have hearts, they want love and women who are sure of themselves should not play games with them. I have a lesbian friend who explains that these girls hop between being fully straight and fully lesbian, but they won't ever call themselves bi."

Yeah that was definitely influential. Although, if i can be picky again, hardly anyones been talking about Cristal for years.

Liquid Swords was a big album for 90's hip hop, but you're getting *way* ahead of yourself trying to claim its considered one of the greatest albums ever across all genres. That's Sgt. Peppers, Illmatic or Thriller kind of territory and you'll find few people saying its reached that level. 

Again, based off quality alone, I wouldn't put it up there with the very best, undeniable classics the genre has to offer. I wouldn't say its on the level of its best contemporaries either like Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt, 36 Chambers and Ready to Die.

Man U signed Mata sure. But they don't need a CAM. They need a DM, CB and a fit class striker. Honestly Man U need about 6 new players to really be competing in my honestly. They're no threat without a top striker and their defence is still leaky as hell. Mata will improve them and may make them a threat when RVP and Rooney are back but they'll be too far behind by then.

Intigo,Guildwars2,1390497342.0,"D/D in a raid is more focused around just dealing damage whereas the Staff has more support, this is true.

That's why 0/10/0/30/30 is great - it allows you to easily switch between the two any time you want with just swapping out a few traits and some gear.

Staff can also deal quite significant damage, though. With proper gear and good use of Meteor Shower + Tornado you can get some absolutely obscene damage numbers. D/D damage is more constant and easier to do on moving targets."

For some reason I'm not worried about the Pack as much as I am the Vikings and Lions.  Mainly because they are now the unknown.  You know what you will get with the Packers, where as the other two teams have new coaches, new philosophies, etc. However our defense was embarrassing last year.  I can guarantee it won't be like that next year and our offense should only improve in the 2nd year of Trestman's offense.  We were averaging 30 points a game and seemed very inconsistent in the first half, which allowed the other teams to dictate the pace of the game.  We usually picked up our game in the 2nd half.  So if we can get some consistency in the first half, there's no telling how many points our O can put up.  

Another big thing is this will be Trestman's second year as a HC in the NFL.  I noticed he would take his foot of the pedal in a lot of games and becoming too conservative I thought.  I don't think he will make make those same mistakes again next season.  His goal line play calling should improve as well.  Overall I think we left a lot of points on the field."

joeph1sh,whowouldwin,1390497448.0,"Strong willed doesn't necessarily equal strong minded.  Ozai's idea of military strategy is to literally burn the world.  It's great psychological warfare, but it's insanely impractical towards running his ""New World Order"" as it would strip him of tons of resources.  Luke would also try to hang back so as not to be in the thick of battle the whole time. In Return of the Jedi, he is mature enough to realize that he should only enter into a fight when he feels that it is the right moment.  This lets him get the drop on the Fire Lord before he even knows it's coming.  As for the ranged game, Luke is a fantastic marksman.  Give him a blaster and he'll bullseye more than the occasional womp rat.  Even without a blaster, Luke can throw his lightsaber and bring it back using the force.

Luke has the biggest advantage of all the combatants IMO, and that's being sane."

&gt;We've got some news for you regarding East vs. West that is going to change the future of the game and introduce the ability for fans to get intimately involved in the development. Since the project was born from modders we thought it was only right that we tell the community here first about the plans for it.
Development schedule permitting, East vs. West will be in beta come March and you will be able to contribute with what you want to get access to it.
This means that if you feel bad about playing the beta and not spending a cent, we will offer the alternative of paying what you want for it, and all money raised this way will go directly to the developers. Development of East vs. West is still being handled by BL Logic, so there are no changes there.
The scope of EvW is being reduced a little bit, you may have heard that some specific features are on hold while BL Logic focuses on the more integral parts of the game, and we agree with the devs that this is in the best interest of the game. As the game continues to improve, we may still decide to release it as a commercial product. Until then, though, a release date for EvW is not currently on our schedule. However, you'll all still be able to play the game in its beta form and support the devs with either your feedback here in the forums, monetarily, or both. "

I'm not sure I understand what you are asking. So I answered the best way I could. 

* No pill makes your breasts larger.

* Hormone changes can make them larger but it is not always the case. We are all different. 

* Genetics has a lot to do with breast size. 

* Some exercise techniques can make the muscle behind your breasts larger thus making you breasts look larger. 

* No combination of magic pills and exercise will make your breasts larger. There is no telling what birth control will do to you.  

* The only way to prevent it is to get a reduction if weightloss didn't solve the issue (not all breasts change with weightloss or are related to weight).

The numbering really isn't that hard.  1-8, an incarnation that renounces the name ""Doctor,"" then 9-12.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390497859.0,"&gt; I wish I could believe you, but so far everything you have said indicates you respect the speech you care about, and want others to shut up so everyone can hear it.

I just don't think some people should be able to drown out everyone else, problem? 

&gt;In the early days of TV they had an equality rule, where both sides of an issue had to be reasonably presented, this was because there was a limited amount of broadcast space. The rule was ruled unconstitutional after cable, and laughable with the internet, it is not possible to drown out your message if the people want to hear it.

I actually think that rule should apply with stuff that's not internet. Mainly because the average person has no control over the content and it's whatever the elites force feed you. Getting rid of the fairness doctrine was a massive mistake IMO, because those kinds of media turn you into a sheep, clinging on to every word, and if they fill it full of lies and misinformation, you're gonna believe it's a lie and misinformation.

Quite frankly, I'd like to at the very least have an official distinction between ""news"" and ""opinion""....since the fairness doctrine ended, the lines between the two have been blurring. The internet, with youtube and all, I see the internet more as the peoples' tool where there's an almost absolute freedom of information. On the other hand, I see radio and tv as propaganda machines. They're controlled by the rich, the poor have little to no access to get their perspectives heard, etc. So guess whose agenda dominates the debate. 

I'm for speech, don't get me wrong. I'm just against a small group having a monopoly on getting their speech out there, because that easily turns into propaganda. 

How about this, I saw this in another topic, but what about limiting campaign contributions to $500 a person, and even allowing a tax break on such contributions? This is a reasonable amount where rich dudes can't throw millions and billions into the system drowning out all other Americans, but at the same time, the average person's contribution, if they wish to contribute that much, could easily match a rich person's.

slapdashbr,buildapc,1390498070.0,"Let me answer you correctly because no one else replying seems to actually know what they are talking about. 

Dual 760s will give you significantly better performance than a single 780 at any resolution up to 2560x1600. I would recommend dual 760s if you want to game on a 2560x1440 or 2560x1600 monitor. A single 780 would fall short of giving you good frame rates at those resolutions. If you have a 1080p monitor, if it is 60Hz, I would recommend a single 770. That will give you 60+ fps in *almost* every title. I don't think the $170 extra for a 780 is worth it when at best, it will give you an extra 10 fps in the handful of games that do not quite hit 60 fps with a 770. If you have a high refresh rate, 1080p monitor, definitely get the dual 760s because you will get substantially higher fps at 1080p than a single 780. 

The main drawback to dual 760s over the 780 is that you need slightly more power and are less flexible in your upgrade path, but honestly, a single 780 is not in a very good place right now for performance to price ratio. It's too expensive to justify on a 1080p screen, but it is not powerful enough to give you good frame rates at higher resolutions. "

You wouldn't let your friend use up an entire quarter's worth of kief all by them self, so why would you let your dealer take it? All this to say you got ripped off if they sold you shake for full price. You got ripped off if you paid for a quarter because that looks like 2.5 at most. Live and learn, OP. Next time have them weigh it out in front of you. It's not rude and if they won't do it, they're ripping you off. Also don't get shake. It might not even be all weed sometimes.

Although with TM's being multiple use you can get perfect move sets on more Pokemon which does make the game significantly easier. They also make the elite 4 easier too.

Wonder trade also acts as an abnormality in the game as it is very possible to get a Pokemon through it that will just stomp through the game for you.

&gt;""I love you! But we can't be together!

This isn't true for the fact that this is the story in the Attack of The Clones. They're in love but they shouldn't be because she's in the Senate and he's a Jedi who are supposed to forsake true love to dedicate themselves to the Force. As they marry at the end it shows that they don't (entirely) care about the fact that it's forbidden - these ramifications come in the later film but you can see them struggling at the start of Ep3.

&gt;So I will turn to the dark side! And then I will try to kill you!

This part is drastically simplified because he turned to the Dark Side in order to *save* Padmé as in his dreams he saw her dying. What he *didn't* see in his visions was the context. At the end it turns out that she's dying in childbirth because she lost the will to live **because** he turned to the Dark Side and wasn't with her anymore (in mind and body). He tries to kill her (well chokes her anyway) to punish her for colluding with Obi Wan and (in his mind) lying to him about it.

&gt;Now I no longer have a motivation to stay with the dark side! But I will anyway!"" 

Again simplified and not quite true. He stayed with the Dark Side because he had succumbed to the Emperor's Dark influence - that and because he thinks that he's killed Padmé (as the Emperor lies to him at the end) so he stays with the Dark Side out of anger and guilt.

So no, it didn't feel forced because it was a gradual progression and eventually it was jealousy and anger but most of all (as Yoda has been saying all along) FEAR that thrust him into the Dark Side and kept him there."

Open relationships require A LOT more communication and will be harder and more challenging, but possibly also more exciting.  There are a lot of good books that come to mind on this subject, one of the most commonly recommended being ""The Ethical Slut.""  It covers many unconventional lifestyles, including couples swinging.  You need to discuss with your partner what exactly will and won't be included in the new understanding between you two.  When, where, who, etc. all need to be discussed.  Will you dating others outside the relationship?  Only swinging together?  Same room, different room, girls only, etc.  As for how/whether all that fits into RPW I wouldn't hazard a guess and will leave that up to the contributors here to advise.

The limited evidence that exists right now (literally one study in athletes and a mention of a pilot study conducted by the same researchers) suggests that there is benefit, but beyond needing replication this study is also confounded.

&gt;Although it would be imprudent to say that HICA is ineffective (which it does not appear to be) and similarly imprudent to say that it is worse than HMB or leucine, due to the lack of comparative data between HICA and HMB/leucine the question of 'which one to use' cannot be answered and we have no indication if HICA is better or worse than the other options.

&gt;HICA holds some promise for future research to tackle, but currently does not have enough evidence to support its usage as a supplement; it may simply be a more expensive and equally effective Leucine.  [Source: examine.com](http://examine.com/supplements/Leucic+Acid/)

WhiteHeterosexualGuy,DotA2,1390498338.0,"It really just depends on how you define skill. I played SC2 for years and to me, it's more of repetetive muscle memory and ""macro"" than anything. Once you play 1000 games it just becomes a series of binary decisions making. Is he going X? Better make Y. Did he take Z expansion? Time to do THIS. Etc.  

Whereas in Dota 2 there are unqiue scenarios every game that reward good decision making much better. Mehcnaics are important to a certain extent, but it is solid decision making skills that separate good players from very good players. In SC2, you can get very good from mechanics alone.  

I could rant for a while on why I think SC2 really suffers. I think the basis of it is they put WAY too much emphasis on macroing. Like, why can't I automate my mules/larvae/chronoboost? These ""mechanics"" add nothing to the gameplay. Forcing someone to do actions every 25 seconds really makes the game shitty for casual players. In fact, even at a pro level, if they didn't have so much bullshit taking up all their APM, there would probably be a lot more creative gameplay and variation. There are a lot of features that fit this same complaint in SC2 and that's pretty much why I stopped playing. "

Oh gotcha, that makes sense.  For work?  I'm potentially looking to get into a field that has quite a bit of travel, and it sounds good in theory, but I realize maybe it gets old.

But it was too extreme - all of it.  Pulling teeth?  Mermaid tattoo?  It's not legit crazy, it's someone trying to sound crazy.  And plus, I actually almost broke the cardinal rule of men, which is ""don't stick your dick in crazy.""  In college, I had this girl that said she was into me, and we used to text all the time.  She was totally insane, but I had just gotten out of a relationship and  sort of went along with it for fun, which to me, is exactly what these guys are doing.  Basically, nothing to lose, if it doesn't work out, then who cares.  I wasn't looking for a relationship and I'm sure she wasn't either, so I was just enjoying the ride.  She was a lingerie model, so why not?  I wasn't attached, but she was hot and I had just gotten out of a relationship, so why not have some fun.  We made out a bit one night, and another night she came over and got naked right in front of me (long story, I didn't let it lead to anything because I wasn't *that* stupid), and that was the end of that.  But she was legit insane, I'm talking sociopathic tendencies.  This hypothetical girl is either a complete joke or incredibly stupid, but not crazy, as in ""don't stick your dick in crazy"" crazy.  Regardless, there's no way all that stuff is real, and if people actually think it is, then they're just as dumb as the profile is trying to be, and it proves nothing.  Plus, someone made a comment on the Cracked article that I think sums it up:

&gt;You were trolling and you got trolled as well, if any of these guys took you seriously, that that was who you really are,then god bless them for being able to wake up and get out of bed without killing themselves cause they would be that stupid.

&gt;Nah, at most, they where looking to get laid, and here was a cute chick ... so repulsive that dumping her on the curb after a quickie will leave them feeling like the scored one for the douche king.

JohnixHD,PKA,1390498457.0,"&gt; So you're saying you think rape porn is acceptable? To shine it in a light where it is 'OK' is disgusting. It's unlawful and belittles women. I am not saying all laws are right but Article 5 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: No more torture. No minds and no bodies shall suffer degrading or inhuman punishment or treatment.

Whoa, whoa, whoa...

As brother of four sisters, no, I'm strongly against rape.

I thought we were discussing Aria Aspen's video, and kinky shit people like to watch. not me in general, my opinion about simulated porn fetishes are **entirely another thing**.

&gt; Some people watch this material and think it is OK or ""Damn that bitch enjoys it so every woman must"" as insane as it sounds there's some fucked up people out there. All I will say is if that 1 person saw it, thought it was OK and acted on it to someone you know the thought you have would be different.

I disagree with you, I think there should be responsibility on the viewer not to act on these impulses or fantasies and get immediate help. Same thing with video games, just because I simulate crimes and murder on a game, it will not it make me want to actually apply these actions in real life.

&gt; Yes I did say boys and girls and yes you should be an adult to view this video but censorship isn't monitored like it should be. I'm 24 and first watched porn when i was around 11 without any difficulty finding it.

Censorship, and paternal supervision are two separate things. I don't have an argument for this though, it's out there, kids are going to find it if they really are persistent.

My personal beliefs are, to each his own. IDC what you do, as long as you don't harm yourself or others. Living in a world without disagreement is impossible, I think each person should take responsibility for their own actions. 

As for the rapists, IDK, rapists are rapists, how do you prevent that? You can't, just keep yourself safe, because we live in a dangerous world."

ZapActions-dower,truegaming,1390498474.0,"There's no one point for every game.  It's very case-by-case, and also very subjective.  You have to basically question every mechanic:  is this mechanic intrinsically enjoyable?  is it in line with reality or more fantastic?  does it interact with other mechanics to make the game overall more enjoyable, even if it by itself isn't that fun?  does it make the player think ""this is silly,"" and if so is it silly-fun, or silly-immersion breaking?  are either of those bad things in the experience you are crafting?

Every mechanic in every game can be looked at like this, and finding the right balance for your particular game is more an art than a science.  And in the end, different people will still want different things from the game."

MrDubious,TrueReddit,1390498609.0,"On your phone, when you take a picture, you look at the screen to line up your shot, right?

On Glass, you guess about where the camera is aiming, and fire it off, and then see your shot immediately on the screen (there's both an audible sound, and the screen comes on). If you're taking the kind of pic Glass is good at (up close and personal), you probably got something that works. However, without the screen, you have no idea what you captured. Walk around with your phone near eye level with the screen completely blocked off and snap some random shots. Your end results will look like what using Glass with no screen will look like. 

Can you feasibly jump through those 99 hoops to try to use Glass covertly?

A few weeks ago I started using [Vanicream](http://www.drugstore.com/vanicream-moisturizing-skin-cream-with-pump-dispenser/qxp17163?catid=182936) instead of the CeraVe, and I'm really liking it so far. Another thing you could try would be the [Clinique Moisture Surge Intense](http://www.sephora.com/moisture-surge-intense-for-very-dry-to-dry-combination-skin-P302901) instead of the DDMG, I really loved the Moisture Surge Intense but it was kind of expensive. I found the Stridex to be very drying, and am planning to try some lactic acid exfoliation in the near future instead.

Here's my current routine, for very dehydrated, sensitive, acne-prone skin:

AM: Rinse with water. Apply pea-sized amount of [Hyaluronic Acid serum](http://www.drugstore.com/hada-labo-tokyo-anti-aging-hydrator/qxp489133?catid=182949). Apply [Vanicream](http://www.drugstore.com/vanicream-moisturizing-skin-cream-with-pump-dispenser/qxp17163?catid=182936). Pat 2 drops of [Trader Joe's Jojoba oil](http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp?itemid=142780) onto cheeks and chin. Finish with [moisturizing SPF30+](http://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Facial-Sunscreen-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B000PHRIYE).

PM: Mineral oil to remove makeup. Wash with CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser. Apply pea-sized amount of [Hyaluronic Acid serum](http://www.drugstore.com/hada-labo-tokyo-anti-aging-hydrator/qxp489133?catid=182949). Apply [Vanicream](http://www.drugstore.com/vanicream-moisturizing-skin-cream-with-pump-dispenser/qxp17163?catid=182936).

The population would last much longer than if they had *not* been cannibals, but they'd still all die out eventually, even with the most efficient of planning.  Not to mention, the defenseless baby rats would be the first to be eaten, because they can't fight back.  Less danger, and less work.

Also, mammals are particularly inefficient animals.  We produce shitloads of heat (a major energy loss) and thus need way more food per day than, say, a lizard.  If you really wanna maximize the length a population could survive on cannibalism alone, you'd do with with an ectotherm."

So you would take your tithe to Jerusalem and throw a party. As this might be difficult, you can sell your tithe locally, and spend that money in Jerusalem on throwing such a feast. 

There are no tithes at all during the seventh year as the land is not worked and the produce belongs to everybody.

Dysalot,IAmA,1390498980.0,"Well currently the newsweek of old is getting hit from both sides. It's a tough balance to strike, but again the article you are linking to came out before they were sold again last August. You have to admit there is a reason people would rather read the news than scientific journals. They want that information parsed down into a format the can understand and in a time frame they can pay attention to. My personal ideal would be to write something that meets those goals, is interesting, and is as factual as possible (note I didn't say balanced).

It is as hard to remove all biases from writing as it is to remove sugar from water. All news wants to sell the exciting story, so that's what you are going to get the stories that are on peoples minds. As long as it is presented as factually as possible I am happy."

To me romance is non-stop foreplay, it gets the heart, body and mind going, and it's something special with one person. It doesn't require flowers or spending money every day.  

Romance also means being vulnerable and trusting the other person, and I feel like a lot of people don't want to be vulnerable, but it's worth it if you can find someone you like and want to be closer to. You don't have to give up yourself to be romantic."

If I avoid that kind of talk then I love reading Red Pill stuff. Girl Game was a revelation. I loved it. FINALLY! An excuse to shed my jeans, doc martin boots, boy hair, and aggressive attitude for skirts and heels and a wink and a giggle. The strategy that landed me my gorgeous boyfriend was saying 'yes' to anyone and I mean ANYONE that asked me out for a coffee or a date. This includes the very brave 18-year old kid who came up to me in a restaurant and asked for my number. I dated heaps of younger men (plenty of older too), so when the 6-years-younger-than-me first officer showed up, it wasn't a big thing.

Okay, first of all, as others have mentioned, there's some sort of instability when you enter doors (green squares). At best, it makes the game freeze up for a second while it loads the new area, and at worst, it makes the game crash. You might want to look into this.

If you absolutely must have loading times, be sure to put a ""Loading"" message in so people don't think the game has frozen up.

The ""screen shake"" motion to imitate walking isn't doing what you want it to. Just makes it seem like you're drunk or something. Best to just drop it.

Zoom out the view so players can see more of the area around the player character.

Simulated movement controls like the one you have are, in my opinion, poorly-suited for smartphones. You may want to think about using other control methods, or at least making them optional. Perhaps it'd be better to have the character move towards a held touch, and shoot at a tap. That way both movement and shooting are relative to the character, not an arbitrary simulated ""joystick"".

The walls don't have the same ""realistic"" texture and look as the rest of the environment. Try changing their colors a bit to make them look more suited to the game's aesthetic.

With a game name like ""glyph"", the logo and typeface you have aren't appropriate. With a name like that you'd expect some sort of ancient rune-kinda' style like the Elder Scrolls games use.

If you can't draw, perhaps make your main character a heiroglyphic, perhaps on a stone monolith moving around the environment. That way no drawing skills are required and it'll even fit the theme of the game. You can even take the theme forward by making different types of enemies different types of heiroglyphics, color-coding them for easy identification. If you decide to go with this theme, I'd suggest changing the arrows to magical energy bolts - that will make them easier to see, more befitting the theme, *and* you can color-code *those* too for power-ups or weapon-switching.

From that point, there are a few different ways you could go:

You could incorporate a color mechanic like that in Ikaruga, where each color has a diametric opposite or ""enemy"".

You could make it a full-fledged action-adventure like Zelda where different spells and glyphs are needed to solve puzzles.

You could make it a simplistic Geometry Wars-style shooter (but if you do this, i'd suggest removing the doors and making it level-based).

You could make the enemies letters and challenge players to shoot them in an order that spells out a word.

And of course, those ideas aren't mutually-exclusive - you can combine them. Basically, you have options.

Anyways, those are my thoughts and suggestions. Hope you find them useful! "

The more women you approach, the more sex you ultimately are going to have and the better chance you will have at meeting a woman who you are compatible with.

Approach anxiety is a killer, and it is hindering many of you from attaining what you want.

I still suffer from approach anxiety, but the few times I approached the beautiful girl in my class or who lived down the hall and finally just said something, I ended up scoring.

Pretend today is the last day you are ever going to be alive, and go out there and approach every piece of ass you see! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain."

Hexorg,AskElectronics,1390499244.0,"It all comes down to what do you want it to look like. So the example in that video, screen can output 8 colors (Red, Greed, Blue, (and combinations:) Yellow, Purple, LighBlue, white, and black(no light)). This is also known as 3-bit [color depth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth) (or bits per pixel) That can be acheived with shift registers for all pins ([something like this](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/SN74HC164N/296-8248-5-ND/376946)). Remember that color depth refers to amount of bits PER PIXEL, not per channel. (channel here is only red or only green, or only blue). So 3-bit color depth means that you have 1-bit per channel (either on or off)

If you want more colors, for example 24-bit color depth (""true color"") (8-bits per channel), you'd need to use an LED driver with Pulse Width Modulation (it's essentially a way to make LED dimmer / brighter). 

[Here](http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/TLC5941NT/296-34378-5-ND/1906430) I found a 16-channel 12-bit PWM constant current driver. This means that you can connect 16 normal leds, or (16/3) = 5 RGB leds (and leave one pin empty), and have 12*3= 36-bit color depth. (of course, in software you can limit it to 24-bit color depth if you want, you can go lower then max color depth, but to go higher you need better equipment).

Keep in mind that the PWM controller is also more expensive then a simple shift register. Also I'd recomment using transistors with shift-registers to establish a proper current flow. To figure out how much current you need, look at the spec. sheet of your RGB LEDs.

kempff,Catholicism,1390499395.0,"I would say it is not a sin at all.

Personally I would just let it go, for several reasons:

* You gave sufficient notice of the error. Your responsibility in the matter is fulfilled.
* Grades don't count for much these days anyway. An error of one degree is materially irrelevant to your academic record.

Other things to consider:

* What if you were on the cusp of a degree and your true score should have been the lower, but because of a mathematical rounding error, you were given the higher?
* What if your future college only lightly regards your biology scores in considering your application for admission?
* What if the significance of this one score is so minuscule that if your overall academic score were calculated with the lower biology score and then recalculated with the higher biology score, the overall score would be mathematically the same, or at least so close to being the same that the difference is negligible?

I don't mean to belabor the point, but let's say I take six courses a year for all four years of high school, and I consistently get a grade of B for each of the 24 courses I take - with the exception of one, for which my true grade is a C but my teacher erroneously gives me a B.

* If I let it go, my cumulative grade would be 3.000.
* If I insist on that one erroneous grade being corrected to a C and my cumulative grade recalculated, my cumulative grade would be 2.958.

That's a difference of 0.042 grade points.

In theory, a single question on a single test on a single day during those four years of high school could make the difference between a B average and a C average. If that is so, then why should anyone care about grades anyway?"

komnenos,AskMen,1390499398.0,"6'4, I'll give my experience up until now.

Like a lot of reddit I've had some trouble with girls.  Throughout high school I never so much as once got a compliment on looks and every time I asked a girl out I was turned down.  Unless saying ""your tall"" is a compliment, and if it is its a stupid one I mean... I kinda already know that I'm tall, thanks for reminding me?  I'm not big, heck I'm fairly athletic and even went so far as to do cross country in college.  But even though everyone who I asked out said no I did have two girls ask me out, so I had that going for me.  But I said ""Thank you but I'm not interested."" to them, it was a bit flattering.

In my freshman year of college my friends set me up on a number of dates.  I had a whole spectrum of girls ranging from a nice 5'1 Korean girl (thought our date went well and she said ""call me"" but when I went on facebook the next day she had gotten in a relationship with someone...) to a 6'1 valkyrie who was more or less like me in practically every way from how she was slightly awkward, to her habits and what she was interested in.  But, I guess I'm a bit picky, I wasn't all to interested in a girl who was that similar to me and I was oblivious to her advances in general (I just looked at my Facebook messages with her from two years back and facepalmed at how stupid I had been there).

Sophomore year I studied abroad in the UK.  At first I stuck with what I knew, I went on a few dates with a French girl in one of my politics classes (she was quite the hipster, she carried a little scooter around that she would use all the time!) and I had a drunk hookup with a Dutch girl (around 6'2!) from down the hall.  My best friend/next door neighbor was Chinese and after getting to know him he introduced me to several Chinese girls.  Up until that time the only compliments I got about my physical appearance had been about my height but for the first time ever I was complimented on other things!  ""You have beautiful eyes"" ""your hair is so gorgeous!"" ""your muscles are so big"".  And a few just straight up said that I was cute/handsome.  No American girl has ever said that to me!  In the span of four months I was asked out numerous times and got in really good with the Chinese and Japanese population at the school and got with plenty of girls.  It was... amazing.  Right now I'm in a long distance relationship with one of the girls (I actually asked her out though) she's intelligent (speaks five languages), we can talk about politics and history and she's a little tall (5'9) which I love.

The trouble is that guys often don't think how harmful these things are. Since no one cares about male appearance, no one makes comments about it ; but judgment about women's looks is thrown all around the place and no one thinks how it makes us feel because it's always been that way. Hell, some women enter beauty contests so this must mean they *want* that, right? So men make these comments casually, and rarely think how it affects any women who may overhear. And boy, does it affect us.

Take this example: [a picture from the front page, supposedly about breast sizes.](http://imgur.com/gallery/gFbzNzD) Then you go to the comments, and see someone say the girl on the right is ""built like a brick."" If this stunning model is ""built like a brick"" what does that make me? Sure, you can keep telling yourself, ""that was just one entitled reddit arsehole."" But there are millions upon millions of these pictures assaulting your eyes yearly, and guys going ""[astonishing beauty X]? Meh, nothing special, I prefer [astonishing beauty Y]."" You can bet your arse I will never feel sexy around someone who finds Christina Hendricks wanting.

Diguiseppimon,birthcontrol,1390499626.0,"As someone who was lucky enough to survive a PE at 14, I can tell you, it is not fun. NuvaRing gets singled out a lot, as well as Yasmin and the sorts, because they tend to have higher concentrations of hormones, and it does have a higher risk. However, ALL birth control carries this risk. What they don't like to tell you, is that many people who get PE's also end up having a blood clotting disorder (such as myself) that they were unaware of. I was taking hormonal bc, and they think that is what triggered it, and the fact that I was in a car accident a few months prior that had affected my legs, is why I got the blood clot. 

Now, because of the fact that I have found that I have a blood clotting disorder, and mine is more severe than the norm (which really, having the disorder I have is *very* common, especially with white *women*), I can only take 3 types of bc safely. I had my tubes tied when I was 15, because at the time, they told me that if I were to get pregnant, there was a very good chance that I would not survive, because of the various clotting issues, and estrogen being one of the things that triggers it. Also because if I did survive, there would be complications, my baby would most definitely have the same disorder passed onto it, if it survived, and so many other risks. I was totally cool with this, because I have never wanted kids in the first place. 
However, I also have endometriosis, so the ONLY reason I take bc is to control my periods.

Remember how I previously stated that I can only take 3 different kinds of bc? Yeah...well, when you have endometriosis, the biggest way to treat it is bc, and I cannot take any of the ones that they use. So I'm SOL. The pill I can take doesn't help with periods, the depo shot is the most god awful thing on the planet, and the only other option is an IUD, which will also cause me further problems. I am currently trying to talk my doc into letting me get a hysterectomy, or some sort of uteran ablation. 


My only advice to women who are scared of these kinds of risks associated with birth control: **Have a full genetic history brought up, and have your doctor do a blood test to see if you have Factor V Leiden disorder**, because that is the biggest form of prevention. Otherwise, there isn't much you can do.  "

Where are you getting this number? How much are you putting down? If you're buying for $130k and putting the normal 20% down, you can get a 15 year mortgage at around $750/mo. I don't know your credit score so I used 3.5% as the interest rate; that may vary based on your personal credit situation.

"
myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1390499817.0,"&gt;Sexual marketplace: Do you think that sex is not a marketplace with intrinsic value of goods (people), trades (sex for time, commitment for friendship, whatever), supply / demand situations? In fact I could view friendship as a marketplace. You may think that's a cold and bitter way to look at the world but I promise you it doesn't affect my happiness one iota.

No that's really not how I think of human interaction.

&gt;The wall: Do you disagree with women's changing attitudes as they become less fertile over time (e.g. the wall)? Or changing attitudes and more desire to ""settle"" as looks fade? People ""settle"" all the time for different reasons, but nobody likes to talk about it.

I don't think there's a tremendous gender difference in fading looks, and I don't think the narrative that TRP paints of women hitting the wall is accurate. To me, it comes off as a revenge fantasy, a cathartic story of sluts getting theirs.

&gt;Solipsism. Yes I know we are not using the primary definition (on merriam webster online), which is to say that you can only prove that your own experiences are real. But with regards to how we have used it (The second definition ""also: extreme egocentrism"" on merriam webster online), do you think women can truly understand the plights of men? Just as perhaps we as men cannot truly understand the plights of women.

I believe I wrote *female* solipsism. It is no secret that TRP considers women egocentric narcissists, unlike men.

&gt;Plate spinining: If it's consensual and not dishonest, what's the problem? Also nobody on TRP is against LTR if that's what you want, and we frequently give advice for men in LTR's. We oppose the idea of marriage because of the legal climate and the lack of benefit it gives to a man, and I don't expect others to agree with that.

I have casual sex. That isn't plate spinning. Plate spinning is using casual sex to demonstrate that you're a ""high value"" man, because you can get laid. I think that's a ridiculous notion, but I don't personally have any moral objection to it as long as it really is honest, although I have seen plenty of RP material encouraging dishonesty.

&gt;Alpha fucks, beta bucks Whether it's a black swan situation here (I've seen it happen; therefore it's at least real in some situations) or common, what do you disagree with? Do you think it's not as prevalent or frequent as we make it out to be?

I don't even subscribe to the ideas of alpha and beta, so no, I don't think this is a real phenomenon.

&gt;Bitter and cynical attitude: Can't speak for others, but not me. I am quite happy and content, and would classify myself as aware, not cynical.

That's cool, but there's a ton of bitterness and cynicism on TRP. Besides, all cynics refer to themselves as ""realists"".

&gt;LMR: I think this is a case of a desire for plausible deniability on the part of a women. The question is can I as a man detect the difference between true forceful resistance (rape) and plausible deniability. To give a personal example, a girl told me she didn't want to sleep with me after a date. I said ""okay, sure, no problem, feel free to sleep on the couch. Or sleep in my bed and I won't touch you, it's your choice."" Not unkind just matter-of-fact. Then she said ""just fuck me already will you.""

[This red pill post](http://np.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/1vtvec/girl_rejects_me_and_says_i_used_to_get_raped_a_lot/) demonstrates the danger of subscribing to the notion of LMR.

&gt;At a party, I started making out with a girl. I push her into a nearby bathroom to get it on. She stops, says ""I'm too drunk"", I reply ""I don't care.""

I know that I've invested several times what this bike is worth into its restoration; with what I've spent I could easily have bought a nice SV650 that would offer roughly the same performance with all of the niceties of a modern bike while offering better aftermarket support and a much better upgrade path.

But you know what? I *like* this bike, and playing with it is *fun*. I've touched every single nut and bolt on this bike, inside and outside of the engine. Everything has been refreshed to as-new or better-than-new condition, and I've learned a ton in the process.

Not everyone can say that about a bike."
misandrical_unicorn,AskWomen,1390499933.0,"Personally, I don't care about race, and I'm definitely attracted to people both of my ethnicity and of a different ethnicity.

That being said, I do think it's more common for people of color to be attracted to white people than the other way around because of societal beauty standards. Especially if you're living in a foreign country where white people are a minority. 

I lived in rural Japan for a while, and it was incredibly easy for my white male friends to get Japanese dates and girlfriends. It was a lot harder for white women and almost impossible for people of color."

Serae,Rabbits,1390500189.0,"Sounds like you don't have a rabbit savy vet.  There are ways to hold a rabbit (like a football with their face in the crook of your arm) in order to calm them.

It's early on in your relationship with your rabbit.  I took General Bismark to the vet to get fixed the second week I had him.  He was spazzy but the vet was rabbit savy (had his own too), gentle and are equipt to deal with scared bunnies.  It went well.

Once I had a good bond with my little guy he was no long spazzy.  Instead he'd cling to my and bury his face in my neck and/or my boobs.  He knew he could feel safe with me.

I would suggest looking into another vet.  jumping off the table isn't ""normal"", it's potentially dangerous.

Spend time on the floor with you bun right now.  Have some treats handy and some toys.  Let her know that you are a safe person to be with and that being near you is good.  Before you know it your rabbit will be very close to you and look to you for comfort instead of running scared.

According to the preface, most of the essays in the book were originally letters to friends, which Jerome published at their insistence and his need for money to, well, fuel his idling.  The book is full of meandering essays on the joys of smoking, sitting around the flat all day, and how best to waste ones time.  His thoughts were that in order to properly idle, one must be actively ignoring other matters.  In his words, ""Idleness, like kisses, to be sweet must be stolen"".

madprudentilla,dogs,1390500217.0,"Having spent a lot of time in shelters and working with rescues, I am one of those people who is, at this point, generally opposed to breeding.  It's really difficult to get those images out of your head.

That said, there was a ban that was supposed to be passed on backyard breeders/puppy mills in California a few years ago that Gov. Schwarzenegger vetoed (I should ask him why at his next AMA).  It limited the number of dogs that one could have to something like 50, and required all dog owners to spay/neuter or pay a hefty fee for a breeding permit (hopefully narrowing it down to just legitimate, reputable breeders).  If implemented I believe it would have significantly cut down on the amount of irresponsible breeding and (imho) morons who ""just want Missy to experience the miracle of life"" or whatever.  Of course, you'll always have people who who don't give a shit what the law says and do whatever they want anyway, but I think they are in the minority and I digress.  

I think /u/blackplague06 makes a very good case above. If we were left with just those reputable breeders, I believe the problems we have with overpopulation and unwanted pets would be reduced significantly.  We'd definitely have a lot fewer people buying/adopting dogs on a whim if they had to research the right breed, find the right breeder, and then hang out on a waiting list for however long.  Additionally, you don't generally see litters of purebred puppies from legitimate, reputable breeders hanging out in the pound.  Years ago when my mom was looking for a dog, we took  a trip over to the shelter in Lancaster, CA because that area is rife with puppy mills and backyard breeders and the shelter's kill rate is extremely high.  It was even worse than we thought-- just in that afternoon I saw litters of purebred American Bulldogs, Border Collies, and gorgeous Alaskan Malamutes.  All of them were around 8-10 weeks (younger than 8 weeks the animals are generally euthanized to save money), and all of them had been confiscated from puppy mills or backyard breeders.

Plus, if you cut down on the number of irresponsible breeders, you'd have fewer zealots like me chewing you out at the dog park for not fixing your dog.

TL;DR Backyard breeders ruin it for everyone."

PracticalDemonkeeper,TwoXChromosomes,1390500236.0,"Exactly! I've always wondered that whenever I hear of another state or politician trying to pass an anti-abortion law that only makes an exception when in the case of a rape or if the mother's life is in serious danger due to a medical condition. If those are your only two valid reasons to terminate a pregnancy (because your true reason isn't good enough to be valid) then what's to stop you from lying to get what you still want? And then soon enough maybe even that exception would be revoked once they realize what's going on.

&gt;We have other giveaways planned that will lead up to the anniversary where you can just log-in and claim an item for free, like the summer giveaway last year -- more info on that soon, too. So there are some free, no-work-necessary items that will be given away.

&gt;Again, these ships are not your average anniversary ships -- you'll see that once you learn more about them. Due to this, there is a little bit more effort needed to give them away for free. They're per character, and they're optional. If you don't end up fancying them, you don't have to work on the projects. But if they do, and we think you will like them quite much, we're allowing you to earn them for FREE, but with a little side of effort.

Kevin_LeStrange,AskReddit,1390500466.0,"That's a very broad question to ask about a very broad field!  It really depends on a few things, including where the degree-holder got their degree, what they specialized in while pursuing that degree, and what sort of Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) or multinational corporation they are working in.  

Let's say, hypothetically, that the degree-holder in question has an International Relations degree from Georgetown University in Washington, DC.  Perhaps they studied International Development, as that is something that could be useful in an NGO as well as in a multinational corporation.  If they are working in an NGO, they might be doing non-profit development in a country that needed it (such as developing irrigation systems in someplace like South Sudan).  If they are working in a multinational corporation, they might be doing the same thing, only for some sort of development firm.  

This is just one example in a vast and complex field.  Therefore you can't pin ""exactly"" what the job is.  Are you studying International Relations, or do you plan to?"

Unlike the norepinephrine and dopamine rush of (*dextro)amphetamines or the seretonin-dopamine-norepinephrine cocktail that is meth, cocaine doesn't cause an obvious, strong body load until higher doses. The main thing you can really feel after a bit of coke is your numb throat and a sense of clear-headed focus. Cocaine seems to mostly reuptake-inhibit seretonin and dopamine, meaning it floods your synaptic clefts with these in a particular way. Without fully noticing it unless they know how to look, a user who has only done a bump or two becomes far more talkative, more confident, and more narcissistic.

itsacalamity,dating_advice,1390500502.0,"The one line that made warning bells flash is ""What would be better? Going through a string of failed relationships like I see some serial monogamists do, or to just be alone?"" This way of thinking absolutely contributes to your problem. What do you expect, to just trip over the person you're meant to spend your life with? The point of dating is to both learn about yourself and what you need and want in a relationship, and learning how to be a good partner. The only way you learn that is experience, and the only way you get experience is to stop telling yourself that you're not suitable (c'mon, do you really think you're undateable until you're a doctor? That's not really the kind of girl you want anyway, is it?). 

And I'm gonna be blunt here, but your youth is over and your life is passing you by. Go out. Experiment. Get rejected. Get NOT rejected when you're sure you're going to be. Get laid. Date someone that's not perfect. Date someone that's almost perfect and then you realize not quite. Spend some time developing hobbies and making yourself the kind of person people like. (And I'm not talking money, I'm talking confidence.) 

GOOD LUCK!"

gta 5 is a perfect example of this. It's a great game but sometimes the deaths seemed random or inconsistent. Of course if you're aware of collision physics, hitboxes and other such elements then you understand that they've designed it in a way to make it more realistic anyone else would think it's just unfair and stupid because it is. So you can get shot 10 times in the arm and survive but one to the head and it's lights out. Similarly, you can just barely survive an 80 mph collision if your body gets tossed into an open field or street and you tumble the right way but you can also fall off your bicycle, hit your head on the curb, break your neck and die. That's real. In reality, some people get lucky, some people take bad falls and aren't so lucky but in a medium where everything is supposed to be decided by skill and smart thinking, it becomes frustrating and impedes on the experience.

namer98,Judaism,1390500675.0,"Article:

BALTIMORE – Tufts University professor Sol Gittleman teaches a course on baseball history, Philadelphia lawyer Howard Goldstein collects baseball items used by Jewish players, and Martin Abramowitz markets baseball cards of Jewish players.

They all take their place beside such past and present Jewish ballplayers as Al Rosen, Ken Holtzman, Art Shamsky and Kevin Youkilis – and many others – as chapter-length subjects of “American Jews &amp; America’s Game: Voices of a Growing Legacy in Baseball,” a 2013 book written by Larry Ruttman, a retired Boston-area lawyer.

The book is sure to be read by American Jews who love baseball and wrap themselves in a bear hug of pride in their coreligionists’ presence – nay, prominence – in the country’s national pastime.

Those fans’ bookshelves would already feature such titles as Peter Levine’s “Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience”; Howard Megdal’s “The Baseball Talmud: The Definitive Position-by-Position Ranking of Baseball’s Chosen Players”; and Robert Slater’s “Great Jews in Sports.”

Writing in Sports Collectors Digest, Dan Schlossberg gave Ruttman’s book the No. 1 ranking among all nonfiction baseball works for 2013.

The book stands apart for focusing on the interviewees’ discussion of their Jewish and baseball identities, rather than their professional résumés alone, said Jonathan Sarna, professor of American Jewish History at Boston’s Brandeis University.

“I really found it surprisingly interesting because it was so different,” Sarna, who admits to not being a big sports fan, says of the book.

“Solomon Schechter thought that you need to know about baseball to be a better American,” says Sarna of the renowned Jewish educator, who died in 1915. “Here, [Ruttman] is saying you can learn about American Jews in baseball in order to be a better Jew.”

Ruttman, now 82, spent five years conducting interviews with a broad array of American Jews to better understand what drew them to the game, the role the sport and Judaism play in their lives, and baseball’s place in American culture. But the commentators aren’t just any old folks off the street; instead, they’re among the movers, shakers and opinion formers of baseball and the sports landscape.

Best pitcher of any religion

The 46 people profiled include Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig; team owners Jerry Reinsdorf (Chicago White Sox) and Stuart Sternberg (Tampa Bay Rays); team executives Theo Epstein (Chicago Cubs), Randy Levine (New York Yankees), Joel Mael (Miami Marlins) and Mark Shapiro (Cleveland Indians); players’ union leaders Marvin Miller and Donald Fehr; and journalists Murray Chass and Ira Berkow.

Along with several past and present MLB players, Ruttman also interviewed Thelma Eisen and Anita Foss, who played in the World War II-era All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, and Leon Feingold, a player in the even shorter-lived Israel Baseball League.

Sandy Koufax – one of the best pitchers of any religion – wouldn’t agree to be interviewed, but Ruttman appeared touched by the great left-hander’s telephoning him to explain. Instead, Ruttman interviewed Norm Sherry, a Jewish catcher who played with his pitcher brother Larry for the Los Angeles Dodgers, from 1959 to 1962, about his famous teammate. That chapter falls flat because it offers nothing on Koufax’s Jewish identity beyond the writer’s perfunctory mention of his famous decision to skip a 1965 World Series pitching appearance that fell on Yom Kippur. (By contrast, Ruttman’s interviews of Steve and Alva Greenberg reveal much about the Jewish identity and legacy of their late father Hank, a slugging first baseman and arguably the greatest Jewish ballplayer ever.)

Ruttman even interviewed Jeffrey Maier, whose claim to fame was attending a 1996 playoff game as a 12-year-old fan and interfering with a ball in play, resulting in a controversial Yankees home run.

Often, the ethnic angle is overplayed, like when Ruttman seems to badger Shamsky about his Jewish influences despite Shamsky’s having stated that none existed.

The result of Ruttman’s effort is less a work of literature than an oral history sprinkled with observations offered by a narrator who’s genuinely interested in the social, family and religious forces at play during the past century.

Ruttman poses a provocative question of some subjects, asking them to compare the long-term futures of baseball and American Jewry. That’s hardly standard fare in Jewish sports books.

Indeed, while reading the book over two consecutive Shabbat afternoons, I vacillated between hopefulness in Judaism’s survival in the tolerant, democratic Diaspora society that fosters such achievers, and utter gloom at American Jewry’s slide, even demise, in the coming century or so. For every Holtzman (he earned the most wins of any Jewish pitcher, surpassing even Koufax) – who married a Jewish woman and kept a kosher home – there are five interviewees who resemble Brad Ausmus (the Detroit Tigers’ new manager), who, like his parents, intermarried, or writer Roger Kahn, who says he’s Jewish ethnically but little more.

That’s not a challenge for American-Jewish-baseball, of course; it’s an American-Jewish challenge. And it’s a reality Ruttman readily acknowledges.

“One of the important themes of this book is the dwindling of community, and intermarriage and assimilation,” Ruttman tells Haaretz from his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, the town where he was raised and, in 1944, celebrated his bar mitzvah.

“I’m very proud of my Jewish heritage,” he says. “I think I’ve learned more about it – and about who I am – by doing this, because I’ve come across Jews from all walks of life.”

An exhibition on baseball and American Jews, “Chasing Dreams: Baseball and Becoming Americans,” will be on display at the National Museum of American Jewish History, Philadelphia, from March 13 - October 26, 2014."
BeachBumHarmony,AskMen,1390500677.0,"Girl here. My parents split when I was 12 due to my Mom falling in love with a guy she knew from High School. He moved in shortly after my Dad moved out. 

Truthfully, I think I had about the same amount of difficulty of finding someone as anyone else. If anything, children of divorced parents see all the issues that can arise in a marriage and are more careful about choosing someone to be with. 

My boyfriend's parents are also divorced as well (when he was a baby, due to incompatibility, not infidelity). He was lucky though to have amazing grandparents that showed him what a relationship could be like. 

I was lucky enough to realize I don't want to be like my Mom. The guy she left my Dad for ended up breaking up with her after a 7 year relationship. She sunk into a depression. She been with a new guy for 5 years and she still talks about her ex. We have a good enough relationship that I can talk to her pretty easily. I've realized she loved my Dad and thought she was in love with him, but she was more of a trophy wife that my Dad adored. My Mom had grown up poor and my Dad showered her with lovely things.

All of your dialogue options are ""Yes! I'd love to help out this organization I know next to nothing about for no agreed upon reward"" or ""I'll do it later""\

And then, when you get to the mainland, you *still* can't just walk wherever you want.  I can't actually link a map of this, but the world is divided up into small chunks, and you can only access those controlled by your faction (the one you are automatically a part of and have no choice about.)  And you can't even freely explore those lands either.  As a member of the Ebonheart pact, it would make sense that you could freely travel all across Skyrim, Morrowind, and Black Marsh, yeah?  Well, you can't.  Your areas have borders, and you can't just walk like in a regular TES game.  In Morrowind, or Oblivion, or Skyrim if you wanted to, you could walk straight into the wilderness and out to the furthest places in the world right from the beginning.  You'd probably be killed on your journey, but you could do it.  Not so in TESO.

C'est peut-être vrai que, coté *application*, les pratiques de l'industrie ne sont pas très bonnes au Québec, mais ça, c'est pas par manque d'expertise de pointe, c'est par manque de volonté politique de modifier les normes et les pratiques courantes.

Pour le reste, cependant, j'en connais pas assez mais j'espère que la commission Charbonneau va faire la lumière là-dessus."

raptor6c,AskMen,1390500821.0,"Giving a good blow job is by no means a walk in the park that you should expect to be able to do on your first few tries with any guy, let along your first ever.  That said, if you want to give a guy a good blow job to a guy you need feedback from that guy to work with.   Every guy is slightly different in his preferences so no technique can be expected to work on your guy just because it's worked on some other guy.  It's good to have an open mind about techniques to try but it's more important that you have an open line of communication between yourself and the guy so you can learn what works for him and what doesn't.

You'll need to pay attention to the guys reactions as you experiment, and he needs to make sure he gives you observable and actionable feedback whenever you do something he likes or doesn't like.  A guy who sits there stoically without reacting or emoting during a BJ is not likely to be coming from it and that's more his fault than yours."

Where as women's motives are inherently good so when they have physical preferences there is nothing wrong with it. 

I think this is why a woman can put height preferences or say things like, ""I only like men tall men who are physically fit and have a good job."" and people think it is ok. But if a man says something equal and opposite to this like ""I like my women to be curvy, yet skinny, and knows how to treat a man"" it is considered wrong.

$99 - Costco has Optimum Nutrition Performance 100% Whey Isolate, 30g of protein for 140 calories.  This was also not part of the Reddit test.  110 servings (two 55 serving tubs).  In stores it runs about $50 per tub.

Remember that whey powder is the crap cheese manufacturers throw away.  These companies then dry it out and sell it to you.  Some of the higher priced gimmicky stuff is a complete rip-off.  Quality controls and ""filtering"" are taking place, but the bigger-more-complex-higher-hyped words being used to mean ""sieve"" should be an eye-opener to marked-up profiteering for non-desirable-cheese-manufacturing-waste.

absinthevisions,AskWomen,1390501001.0,"Not at all. My c-section was 100% unnecessary. I only had one because it was a holiday and my ob wanted to be home for it. My ob lied to me to get me to consent to it. I was not in labor but just looked favorable for labor. She was worried she was going to miss her holiday so she told me that we should induce and when I told her no and that she knew I wanted a natural birth she pulled the dead baby card and said I needed an emergency c-section. I was walking out of her office to go home about 30 seconds before this conversation. There was no emergency 30 seconds prior to me refusing induction. 

At the time of the birth I had issues with the anesthetic so I felt over half of my surgery. I ended up with PTSD from the surgery it's self. I was the very last person to hold or even see my baby. I saw pictures of her before I actually saw her. I didn't see her for the first 5 hours of her life. This plus the pain made bonding difficult and breastfeeding impossible. The OB glued my incision closed and the first time I sat up it came open. They then had to take me away from my baby yet again to stitch it up. 

I also ended up with Postpartum Psychosis which is an extreme form of Postpartum Depression. I was having auditory and visual hallucinations when my OB sent me home from the hospital. She said I had ""baby blues"" and was being dramatic.

It took 8-10 weeks for me to feel remotely human again. I spent time in a mental hospital due to the PPP and PTSD ( I had friends who were nice enough to take care of my new born along with their new born while I was in the hospital). I had zero feelings for my daughter for the first 6 months of her life. Someone could have literally rang the door bell and said ""I need a baby and I hear you had one. Can I have it?"" and I would have handed her over without a second thought and went on with my life. 

Physically I was in pain for about a year after the surgery. I've ended up with Endometriosis from where my OB stitched my uterus incorrectly. I've had 2 surgeries to help the pain from it but It ended up attacking my Fallopian tubes so I can no longer get pregnant naturally. IVF is my only option and it costs around $20,000 a round. I also have adhesions which cause some pain and probably needs surgery but I can't afford it at the moment because I'm still paying for the endo surgeries."

Obviously the Jenkins pick can't be totally ignored, but I'm not going to write off our ability to draft at the position because of one bad pick.

I don't think either of us can be right though, it's our personal opinions. Maybe someday some council will decide if those numbers have a strong enough significance that it will cause an abolition, but until that happens, we should take personal responsibility not to be rapist. Not that it will help prevent rapists into becoming rapists, like I said before, rapists have existed for a long time now.

**GPU:** GTX 770

**MoBo:** Your favorite ASUS or Gigabyte LGA 1150 board (or ASRock if your budget is *really* tight). I have a Gigabyte Z87mx because it has the best balance of features and price IMO  
**PSU:** You'll need at least 600w. It's imperative that you don't skimp on this one. Spend at least $70, and look for one with a single 12v rail and is at least 80 Plus Bronze certified  
**HDD:** Kingston V300 SSD (I recommend 120GB) + 1TB WD Blue or Black. Pass on the SSD if you can't afford it but I *highly* recommend you get one. 8 sec boot times and instant loading in games is totally worth the extra $70  
**Case:** Whatever you can afford that fits everything and looks good to you. 

Shouldn't cost more than $1000. If you can't spend that much, drop the CPU down to an i5 3350P. Still can't afford it? Get an i3 4130 (I can't recommend AMD CPUs as they can't even compete with Intel right now when it comes to gaming). *Still* can't afford it? Change the GPU to an R9 270. *Still* can't afford it?

But I am a voluntaryist, meaning that I am not going to use force against the peaceful, and I will defend my person and property from force, and -as with any ethical position- I expect the same of my fellow humans.

This also means that I am all for economic experiments in collectivism, syndicalism, cooperatives, hell even primitivism. I think that once our we outgrow the state and all other institutions of force, then I think it is a fantastic idea to try these out. I like the market system, I like its liberty, I like the level of responsibility it requires, and I think it is a sufficiently efficient system to provide prosperity to those who participate.

Given our now resolved definitional problem I can see why my using words like voluntary exchange to describe actual capitalism isn't accurate. I also don't think that trading time for currency is necessarily exploitive, and while I am not a fan of wage-work and I prefer to create and trade goods and services individually, I would not force someone to stop employing people, and if people wish to trade their time for money I don't really see the issue. If you oppose markets I would be interested to know why. Also, are you a fan of Marxist thought, if so what do you think about violent revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat?"

keakealani,singing,1390501448.0,"In addition to what others have mentioned, I think it's important to stress the value of networking in professional music fields. It's crucial that you know others in your professional circles, and that you make it a point to market your skills to others. This is really true in every field, but I feel especially certain aspects of music, like independent gigs or teaching jobs, really require you to be your own marketing agent because you normally don't have anyone else doing that job for you. 

Of course, this does matter heavily on your needs and goals - if you could be more specific about what kinds of jobs you're looking for, that would be helpful. Within singing and music, I feel like there are three major paths - performance (with the subsets being operatic or non-operatic), solo teaching, and classroom teaching or choral directing. There is also of course the option of continued education - if you're looking to do things like music theory, musicology, or pedagogy, that might be the place for you. 

It's hard to give you too much advice without knowing what you want to do, but I'd suggest talking to people in your local music scene and seeing what they know about the job market. Or, if you're planning on relocating, get in touch with professional musicians there and begin forging those connections."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,CrappyDesign,1390501460.0,"It's the patchwork, hodge podge, horrible christmas sweater that isn't being worn ironically design that I hate. It looks like Aunt Katherine knitted a sweater for nephew Timmy and regurgitated America all over it and he is forced to wear it in his school picture. 

So many designs would be more appropriate. These are young athletes, they don't want to wear grandma clothes. For instance:

[Ex1](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00weuTjhnCLvca/Sport-Sweater-MM-012-.jpg) type look in red white and blue and the american flag patch would be perfect. It is warm, has athletic homages with the side angled sleeve and zip up front. It's both classic and somewhat modern. Perfect for a young athlete.

[Ex 2](http://cdnc.lystit.com/photos/2013/09/11/chloe-beige-beige-contrast_striped-sporty-sweater-product-1-13392985-644015776_large_flex.jpeg) Again, done it r/w/b. Bit more modern, very sleek yet simple. Could be done in thicker, warmer knit. The curved sleeves still have that athletic vibe but also body conscious and new.

[Ex 3](http://cdn12.lbstatic.nu/files/looks/medium/2014/01/04/3487923_everythings-better-in-a-sweater.jpg%3F1388856629) Go very minamalist in all white and just have the flag at the sleeves. Very polished and would stand out by it's simplicity so still eye catching but in a subtle, modest way. 

[Ex4](http://www.gd-wholesale.com/userimg/1/3476i2/sport-sweater-764.jpg) Make it a thicker weave, red white and blue stripes. Athletic, vaguely retro yet sporty. 

Sorry to go off in a long argument to your simple comment. I'm just sick of what Polo does every year to the olympians. They dress them up like such tools. They always look like little kids who are forced into a doll outfit by their mothers. They need to step down and get someone who will not dress these young athletes like they are halfway to the grave. 


edit: Apparently I am a way off base on what I think would be more appropriate sweater for olympic athletes and instead have made myself a perfect example for this sub :) I was being serious with these examples, but in a brainstorming sense. In various interior design subs this is what people do, shoot out a bunch of ideas and people build off of them or say what they would change. Out of curiosity, what would people think is a better sweater design instead of mine or polo's?

Miserable times, but powerful memories and they're some of the last I'd let go if someone was making me erase my memories. 

That guy probably remembers you as a good guy doing his best in a very difficult situation and who was there for him in a moment of despair.  A stranger who cared even though he had no reason to care.  He definitely remembers it differently than you do and probably doesn't remember how long it took you to take your hand off the gun. What was important to you wasn't important to him at all. 

Also, death isn't treated the same in middle eastern cultures. Certainly, there is grieving, but death is a familiar constant companion.

There are quite a few artifact and lands that are legendary that you can play 1 and use it for a turn or two, then when you draw a second, you use the first, play the second, and then use the second one to effectively get 2 uses out of it.  This is probably most common with robots (Mox opal) and legacy elves (gaea's cradle).

This is also possible with planeswalkers.  For example, liliana of the veil is already out and they have 2 creatures, one of which is geist of saint traft, you can use her -2 to make them sac the extra creature, then play a second liliana from your hand, sacrificing your lili that you already used, and use the new lili to make them sac the geist.

These scenes, besides providing more depth to the overall story and the characters, allow you to attempt a romance (or friendship) between the characters.

* **Sugaring off:** Early- to mid-April is a good time and you should be in the thick of it then.  That being said, this winter is being particularly bad for maple syrup growth, but I doubt that will have a huge impact on the availability and food directly at the source.

* **Rent a car:** Yes, definitely.  You'll need the car to get around pretty much everywhere anyway.

* **Foods:** Poutine.  It's decidedly not romantic, but it's also the quintessential Québec food.  Other than that, places like Aux Anciens Canadiens in Old Quebec are awesome.

* **Must-see:** In Quebec City, I recommend a drive to Wendake.  It's technically still a Huron reserve, but Quebec's urban sprawl has reached the village now so it's got some nice touristy things that a lot of people miss if they don't know about it.

* **Skip Trois-Rivières?** I don't know.  It's definitely not as focused on tourism as Montreal or Quebec City, but someone from there could probably point you to a few good places.

Have fun with your new bride in Quebec.  It's a beautiful place and the people are incredibly friendly."

Fun facts like ""Even if you're a master swordsman, your penis can't compete with your tongue in terms of creating clitoral stimulation. Why? The amount of stimulation cunnilingus provides is unnatural. Think about it: If the clitoris was meant to receive that much direct stimulation, Mother Nature would have placed it within the vaginal walls instead of on the periphery.""

and

""A recent study points to the fact that men feel the need to perform oral sex on a woman in an attempt to keep the woman from straying. And while this strategy may be successful in the short-term, it will ultimately end up being a failure. If a woman falls in love with your tongue, it's only a matter of time before she falls out of love with you. Thus, it's better to find a female who loves you for a sustainable reason -- **such as your mind or your penis**.""

Oh don't forget, I may become a lesbian!

""Even if a male reaches the peak of his ability at the art of cunnilingus, he can't compete with the intimate knowledge a female mind provides when engaging in this activity. Thus, if a woman truly loves oral sex, she will eventually find herself in the arms of a lesbian. **Think of cunnilingus as being comparable to marijuana and lesbianism being comparable to hardcore drugs such as heroin and crack.** This gateway is best to be avoided."""

tangerinelion,buildapc,1390501742.0,"What you have would build a computer; I don't see anything that isn't compatible.

But it has a couple questionable choices.  

First - RAM.  You want 2x4GB over 1x8GB.  Unless you want to go to 16GB (2x8GB).  The DDR3-1600 is a good choice, definitely avoid anything slower.  That said you may find some DDR3-1866 or 2133 that is only a few dollars more.  I would get that instead.  Even if you can't make use of the faster speed you can always tighten your timings and get a little better performance.  This won't be that noticeable in gaming, but it should make video editing (especially at HD resolutions) a bit faster.  

Next is your graphics card.  A 650Ti is last-generation, originally from Oct 2012.  You would get better performance from a 760.  Of course that comes at a higher price.  The 760 certainly will run those games at maximum settings in 1080p and should let you run future games at or near maximum settings as well.  The 650Ti will be outdated sooner but if the price is an issue it's not the worst choice.  Still, I'd say it's better to spend $1300 now instead of $1200 now and $300 in a year.

If at all possible you should work a SSD into this.  It doesn't need to be now, but if you opt to do this later you will run into the problem of porting over your OS installation to another drive.  Done correctly this is a hassle, done incorrectly it's a complete pain.  Something like a Samsung 250GB drive would work great; I have two of them in two different machines.  My i7 laptop takes 2.8 seconds to get from the grub loader to an Ubuntu login screen.  The other one I put in a fairly old Q6600 @ 3.0GHz running Win7; it boots about a minute faster compared to the Seagate (HDD) 250GB RAID1 setup I had.

As far as PSU goes, you have chosen a good manufacturer and enough power.  I don't see that as an issue.

Lastly.  We need to talk networks.  Your motherboard has a 1Gbps Ethernet port, I'm not sure why you're adding in a PCie NIC.  And if you have that NIC then I assume you are planning on wiring it in, making a WiFi card unnecessary.  On the premise you'll connect via Ethernet, I'd drop both the WiFi and PCIe NIC.  Connecting to two different LANs you'd obviously want to add the appropriate card, but for a single network you should do fine with the onboard LAN.  Use the extra money on a graphics card or put it towards a SSD later on."

Mit anderen Worten: Lanz ist zu weit rechts. 

Na und?

Wollen wir wirklich jede politische Meinung eines Mitarbeiters des ÖRR verbannen? Das Fernsehen und Radio würde dadurch deutlich grauer und seelenloser werden. Oliver Welke ist auch zu weit links, der Pädophilieskandal der Grünen wurde mit einem Halbsatz abghakt, und niemand würde ihn dafür absetzen, im Gegenteil man stelle sich nur mal den Aufschrei vor, wenn die Heute-Show wegen fehlender politischer Neutralität nicht mehr ausgestrahlt würde und um ehrlich zu sein, das Niveau derselbigen liegt nicht weit über 'Markus Lanz'.

injoy,Christianity,1390501795.0,"Don't forget that every single person is individually guilty of trespassing unforgivably against God.  For God to save only *one* is more remarkable than if He had justly condemned them all.  Your logic about many vs few here is earthly and human, frankly.  Should a federal judge let 99% of all murderers go to show his mercy, and condemn only 1% for an example?  Is that a good demonstration of justice and perfection?  And yet God is far more perfect than an earthly judge, and our sins far greater than murder.

No, Satan doesn't win. Sin is *punished*.  That is not winning.  Again, this is not Scriptural logic.

Your questions are answered by the verse before, Romans 5:17:
&gt;For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will **those who _receive_ the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness** reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.

My experience has been, like others, that it is difficult to tell how much of a woman's lack of attraction is about height. I think it's better to think of it as a sliding scale rather than a matter/doesn't matter sort of thing.

I also have a slightly different take on the idea of a girl being ""shallow"" for excluding short men. I think there are two very different things that can happen. If a woman simply likes tall men or is turned off by short men, there's nothing shallow about pursuing what she finds attractive, and it's not her duty to look past her own preferences. 
On the other hand, I *do* tend to think it's shallow in most cases when a girl's standard is simply *""taller than me""*.  Much of the time there, she seems to be rejecting men not because they aren't attractive to her by themselves but because she doesn't like the idea of *other* people looking down on them, as it were. "
Cautiously_Curious,AskMen,1390501882.0,"&gt;No, it leads to the notion that it is illegal.

To have a concept of illegality, you must first have a concept of law. To develop law you must first have a concept of right and wrong. Now, people's perceptions of right and wrong may differ and what ends up enshrined in law may reflect one groups notion of right and wrong rather than another, but it certainly doesn't mean that there is no relationship between notions of right/wrong and the law or that the former generally precedes the latter.

&gt;If I say ""Well, my pig can't fly"" that doens't prove that there is a general rule saying pigs can fly.

Ah, I can see where we've been talking past each other. The phrase is normally used when a general rule has already been established, i.e. pigs can't fly, to explain why an exception doesn't disprove this rule. Of course, the other way around doesn't make sense.

&gt;Anyway, you seem to lack basic understanding of the concepts you really enjoy arguing, that makes this a waste of time.

---

Chapter One.


The farther the little car-shaped dot on my GPS got from Virginia, the easier I breathed. My muscles relaxed as the landscape faded from the rolling hills dotted with cedar trees, to the—hilarious—Jesus billboards of the good-intentioned Midwest, and finally to the tall grass prairies of the only state I’d call home. 

A swatch of green hues crawled across the screen of my GPS radar, demanding my attention. The first storm, maybe even the first tornado of the year was just miles away. I gripped the wheel tightly, trying to control my excitement.

“Imogen!” Diana yelled. “TAKE THE EXIT!”

Snapping out of a trance, I forcefully turned the steering wheel to the right, causing Diana to fall into me from the passenger seat.

“Chill, Di—I got it.” I tried to say this in a *chill* way, but the wavering of my voice said otherwise. After a deep breath, I relaxed my grip on the wheel, hoping my voice would steady along with it. Clearing my throat, I repeated, “I, uh, got it.”

“Damn. How spaced out were you? That British robot was prepping you for that turn for, like, two freaking miles!”

With a gasp, I whipped my head toward my supposed best friend, faking a menacing glare. As always, Diana broke a smile first, then our fake fight ended, only to be replaced by increasingly delirious laughter. After all, we’d been in a car for sixteen hours or so, shifting restlessly between eating, napping, trying to find tolerable radio stations, and driving. We saw the sun rise over lush mountains, and in moments we would see it set over the dry plains. 

“Y’need me to drive?” Diana asked.

“Nah, you drove enough."" 

Even though I tried to hide it, snark crept into my words. Diana’s eyes squinted at me, and I had to bite my lip to stop from laughing. I drove a majority of the trip, but I felt safer that way.

“Is this because…” Diana started.

“You hit the rumble strips *eleven times* in one hour? Yeah, that’s it.”

“Well sorry!” she said, stretching out the word to make a point. “Ohio’s effing boring. And don’t get me started on Indiana.”

“Yeah, I think I got that, considering you spent all of Illinois bitching about it.”

I scanned the GPS one more time. Behind the greens laid a color that made me sit up straight and hold my breath: red. Dark red. If we stayed on this road, we’d run parallel to one hell of a storm, but if I took one of the upcoming exits…

“Oh, here we go,” Diana said, throwing her hands up into the air and slouching back in her seat. “I know you paid, like, a ton of money for this GPS-slash-weather radar combo, but how can you even read the map with all those colors?”

“Want a sneak peek of what you got yourself into this summer?” I asked, ignoring her question.

Diana’s already pale face went stark white as we made eye contact. If this was any sign of the months to come, that city girl was in for a rough time.

lavender-fields,TrollXChromosomes,1390501948.0,"It's because when male and female are typically only used as nouns when referring to animals or in a clinical context.  We have special words to refer to male and female humans, so to use something else implies that the subject is less human or that they are being studied clinically.

It's especially problematic when talking about women, because the word ""woman"" has been given a lot of unnecessary baggage.  You'll notice that a lot of people, both male and female, are more comfortable referring to female adults as ""girls"" rather than ""women"" whereas nobody blinks at referring to male adults as ""men"" rather than ""boys"".  This is my own crack feminist theory, but I think it's because ""women"" are adult, self-possessed, and potentially intimidating to men whereas ""girls"" are pliable and naive.  It's all about infantilizing.  So when people get squicked out by the word ""women"" and use ""females"" instead they're reinforcing the idea that there is something wrong with calling female adults women.

there really needs to be more medical study on the effect of trees on those who are under 18. i know there is a lot of propaganda about it and how it changes the brain chemistry, etc, but it would be good to find out for sure.

for anyone who is 18+, a consenting adult in other words, i think it should be your choice. until then, i'd want to see some actual studies on the effect on teens."
TaylorS1986,politics,1390501996.0,"&gt;Many are just a hair's breadth from radicalization, so if you speculate towards the extremes -- let's say national political will miraculously shifting way left towards sweeping reforms of policing. Many, many, many members police departments would be spending their free time joining scary groups and engaging in some pretty aggressive political tactics, so even in the face of that kind of political will, it could get scary. 

The police have ALWAYS been the enforcers of the ruling class and have always had far-right, fascist tendencies.

IIRC a large % of cops in Greece are members or supporters of the fascist Golden Dawn party.

There is a reason those of us on the far-Left hate the police with a burning passion, and it has nothing to do with supposed edgy ""fuck da man"" immaturity."

keakealani,singing,1390502024.0,"Very nice! Just to add some other comments (although you have great feedback already)...

* Be careful about your initial consonants. It doesn't feel like you're preparing them ahead of the beat, and as a result you sound slightly late. Remember that the tone starts on the vowel, so consonants need to be ahead of the beat in order for the tone of the syllable to start squarely on the beat. I also think this could help with /u/little_miss_kaea's suggestion about tuning the start of the phrase - clear consonants can help you start the airflow so that you can tune the pitch a little better. 

* As a generalized comment, keep your air flowing through each note. It feels as if each note is the start of a new phrase, rather than one consistent arc of sound. One tip I've learned is to think about the last 25% of each note having increased energy. Even if it's a short note, give it a little extra energy and air right at the end, leading to the next note. It will help you connect the phrase and actually is more efficient in terms of breath. 

* I'm a bit concerned about your tempo. I've sung this piece before and I can't remember that many dramatic tempo changes, although I could be misremembering. Either way, I feel that the tempos need to be a little more deliberate - it sometimes feels as if it's either too rushed or too late. Try practicing with a metronome, and then moving away from it once you're solid on the beat. 

* Just as a minor nitpicky things, standard Latin diction prescribes a dentalized ""t"" sound (as in ""qui tollis"") rather than an aspirated ""t"" as in English. It's not the most egregious, but I think the aspirated sound is a bit harsh and takes away from the character of the phrases. 

Anyway, you sing really well! These are pretty nitpicky points but you clearly have a wonderful voice. "

Unfortunately, that's the price you pay when you go into that industry. It will live on forever. Whether or not this is worthy of a breakup is up to you. If you think she was just embarrassed and this was a one-time lie that you can get over, then forgive her.

The thing about tranquils, particularly in the early game, is that the regen they provide is really huge.  

For example, the proper way to utilize them is to avoid letting the enemy team harass you out of exp range.  Let's say the enemies harass you down to 50% and you do the same.  With tranquil boots you can essentially hide in the treeline at max exp range and be back to full health within ~30 seconds, while the enemy has to either back or use 1 or more regen items to stay in lane.

1. The course is based on raw memorization of the textbook and about a billion foreign terms.

2. Exams are random and often have nothing to do with material discussed in class or even read from the book. Professor Stephens literally makes shit up on the spot. Evidence: my class waited for a full hour of the two-hour final exam block for Stephens to write the exam then and there.

3. The TAs are equally incompetent. My TA literally lost ALL of my submitted assignments and claimed she never received them, even though I handed them to her along with all the other students during discussion.

4. Lectures are mostly comprised of Professor Stephens bragging about himself for an hour or so.

Please, before you consider this course read the reviews on ratemyprofessor. I was so angry with the quality of this course that after I finished the course (with a hard earned A, despite all this) I wrote an angry letter to the department head. There is no way this man should still be teaching.

borntoperform,warriors,1390502178.0,"This is exactly what I was thinking. We will be a 4th/5th seed, play the Clippers, beat them and laugh at Chris Paul for never getting past the first round. However, despite being the better team in this matchup, if the Jackson's idiotic rotations continue into the playoffs, then we'll lose.

Then we'll play the Thunder in the second round, with the odds of beating them at 25%. There's a chance we can beat them if turnovers are low, Curry and Thompson shoot at 40% threes, Lee gets his double doubles, Durant doesn't score 54 points, and we don't allow stupid offensive rebounds that let Westbrook win the game at the buzzer. 

If we beat them, we'll see the Spurs in the Conference Finals, again with the odds of beating them at 25%.

The lack of depth on this team is killing us. Barnes is playing like he's a rookie, Bazemore needs to be sent to the D-League, Nedovic needs more development, and we REALLY need O'Neal and Ezeli back."

I'm saying that if you believe that the gender imbalances in certain professions is something that we should work to eliminate, you should be aware that simply reducing sexism and expanding women's choices seems to worsen these imbalances, rather than alleviate them.

In no way am I suggesting that becoming a homemaker is a bad thing.

&gt;You can't exactly call it a gender imbalance if sticking to traditional gender roles is what works for a family.

What the heck do you mean by that?  Those are two completely independent concepts.  A woman who doesn't go into the military because her staying at home instead works best for her family doesn't change the fact that there is a gender imbalance in the military."

My [twin] brother got the idea to start selling sodas. He'd buy a 12 pack of store brand soda for around $2.00 and would sell the cans (Which were nicely chilled and stored in a gigantic cooler) for 50 cents a piece at school. He started to make mad money.

Well, the soda thing was nice, so I worked it out with him that he would sell sodas, and I would start selling Little Debbie Snacks and we worked it out with, I would make the rounds at school to sell Little Debbie Snacks (again, 50 cents a piece), and then when everyone was nice and thirsty (because some of the cakes or treats were relatively dry) my brother would go around and sell his sodas. 

We would usually be sold out by midday and if we weren't, we were almost always guaranteed to sell out at lunch. Was only a few bucks a day, but hey, MONEY WAS MONEY! After a few weeks we both started to get nice little profits.

Now here comes the kicker - though what we were doing at the school per the schools policies could lead to suspension, we were never ""Caught"" or ""tattled on"" - why? Our main customers were the teachers themselves. "

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390502434.0,"Now i see the disconnect: I'm not sure you understand how a corporation works. Boards of directors and shareholders hire and fire people like CEOs, who manage the corporation, but ultimately the corporation is controlled by the shareholders (who appoint the board). CEOs are frequently replaced.  The corporation is also its own entity, and can be held liable legally, separate from the employees. The identity (and thus gender) of the corporation is not bound to intensities of the managers. 

You seem to be confusing this for non incorporated businesses, where a single person or a few partners are in direct control and directly responsible for the actions of the company. Partners are usually permanent or near to it. The identity (and thus gender) of the company or firm is bound to its partners. 

This distinction appears to be the source of your confusion. "

Maybe it would be to tough to produce that many episodes at once. But I hope they do something with that extra footage. Maybe give to each team so they can use it for their website.

undergroundmonorail,AskReddit,1390502530.0,"Every website has a bunch of numbers associated called an IP address. (This is technically true of every computer than can see the internet, but right now we're talking about websites). If you know the IP address, you can type that directly into your browser and go to the website. For example, [this link](http://74.125.225.34/) should take you to Google.

It's really hard to remember IP addresses, though, so people invented DNS servers. DNS servers act as a map to an IP address. When you type ""google.com"" into a web browser, it contacts a DNS server and says ""Where does google.com point to?"" The DNS server replies ""http://74.125.225.34/"", and your web browser takes you there.

Sometimes something happens to the DNS server that makes it stop working. This is hard to diagnose because on your end it just looks like you can't access any web pages. What OP suggests is using a different DNS server, one owned by google, to see if the problem is with your internet or the DNS server you're using."

Nevertheless, the Republicans will never adopt Libertarianism in its entirety but rather incorporate bits and pieces of our ideology into their own.

If, for what ever reason, they decide to do the opposite of my prediction and turn to even more conservative leaning candidates they're not giving away 2016 but also their future as a party.

So you just need to be aware that you're PAYING for taunt, and your enemies will likely be killing your creatures for board control anyway, so you often end up paying for your opponents to do what they were planning on doing anyway.

There's a definite place for taunt creatures though -- protecting creatures with effects from being casually killed, defending against Leroy Jenkins, etc.

So either he'll kill it, or he'll ignore it and you'll destroy his board or him with it.  Either way, it's pretty solid.  "

I'm a little confused about the bird friend, too. Maybe that can be cleared up a bit. Also, I agree about ""xite"" - unsure about the pronunciation, and it really just distracted me. 

I think the reaction to the mugging isn't exactly genuine, though that could just be me. ""...she couldn't be mugged — not again."" It's not like she really feels like she has a choice, here. The guy has a gun and is probably much larger than her. Maybe something in the realm of ""She couldn't believe it — she was getting mugged for the second time this month."" would be a bit more believable? You could also take us through her thought process a little more in that paragraph to heighten the drama. It would be neat to see her scroll through her choices (run, fight, or give him the wallet).

frackaracka,worldnews,1390502801.0,"&gt; there are two India, one that is progressive enough economically and culturally to rival even western nations but mostly in the cities

Indian-American woman here. I'm going to disagree with you regarding India rivaling Western nations on a cultural front. While Indians in cities may be more progressive than their rural counterparts, I haven't seen a complete erasure of the mindset that women are second-class citizens until marriage and motherhood. Consider the following:

* Women in both rural and urban India are not allowed to touch or participate in pujas if they are menstruating. As if our periods, which are a natural part of being a woman, inherently made us dirty.
* Women in cities are generally encouraged to marry before they are 30 and therefore ""too old"", or are encouraged to marry before they are successful in their careers. Women often marry and have children in their 30s in the U.S., so this is by no means merely a biological restriction.
* [This episode of Satyamev Jayate bursts the myth that female infanticide only occurs in rural India.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1ByZCLOvXY) (24:43) It's shocking how even big city physicians will happily perform an abortion on a female fetus.

These are just a few things off the top of my head, but there's way more where that came from. I'd count my family as fairly progressive for Indians, and I still have to deal with some backwards notions like the above, *especially* whenever we visit our relatives - and they live in Mumbai, one of the more safe and progressive cities in India! 

I've grown up walking the line between American and Indian culture, and I can assure you that even the more progressive Indian attitudes are still way behind some of the more conservative aspects of American culture, at least with regards to women.

EDIT: I'm going to amend my statement that progressive Indian attitudes are behind conservative American attitudes. What I meant to say was that your average conservative Indian is going to be way more conservative than your average conservative American, but even a progressive Indian can adhere to some conservative traditions."

Ensurdagen,Greyhounds,1390502818.0,"You're being unspecific, which is unhelpful to the OP. Most greyhounds are reasonably well-behaved right off of the track, if a bit bad at leashes and knowing the difference between in and outside. What does ""not a dog"" mean, and how are they not dogs when they are adopted? 

Just because greyhounds don't have the same mannerisms as other dogs doesn't make them a bad first choice, unless the person making the choice thinks they will be like other dogs. Training greyhounds to follow the commands you'd teach a lab is an exercise in futility, they take a long time to understand the concept of each command, but not everyone needs to have a dog that quickly learns spoken commands. 

Perhaps I'm biased because my family has a greyhound/problem-dog foster kennel and most of the non-greyhounds I deal with are former strays/hoarder dogs, but they are way more manageable than puppies for sure. I've got 3 greyhounds (have seen 5 of my own pass as well), a greyhound/wolfhound lurcher, and a part-borzoi, the worst thing the greyhounds do after a few months of learning their boundaries is steal food off the edge of the kitchen counter. The worst behaved one is the lurcher, though she used to be a hunting dog, she took a long time to adjust to family life. The hardest to command is the borzoi, an ex-stray, because he's so anxious and stubborn."

My thoughts/what I would do:

1. Give two weeks notice and prepare yourself for serious insanity. That's what happened with me and it was not pretty, but it's ONLY TWO WEEKS! She may tell you to get out beforehand. Do not listen to her if she offers to pay you more, etc. She is going to go back on her word (again).
2. If it gets so ugly that you can't make it two weeks, fuck it. Just leave. Keep your sanity and remove the stress.
3. As far as her only hiring one person for the project, HER PROBLEM! You've gone above and beyond for her and she's treated you like shit. She should have thought about that before being such an evil bitch.
4. As far as her ruining your reputation, if she's as nuts as you say she is, I bet a lot of other people are aware of it and will take her words with a grain of salt. Don't sweat that part. 

Toxic people will eventually make you toxic. Take care of yourself and do not worry about the potential repurcussions. Your well being is the most important and you don't owe this woman ANYTHING!

akhbox,AskReddit,1390503002.0,"Well yeah, the intention was to make you laugh :)

And as for the other stuff you said, it can be pretty hard growing up in that environment. Growing up myself, it was kinda similar. Parents would always tell me to ""take responsibility for my actions"", but it was when I was about sixteen that I realized how much guilt it made me feel. And then the guilt just took over everything. From doing bad in school to breaking my arm. To this day I still avoid telling my parents little things I messed up just to avoid that guilt.

That being said, it could also have to do with where you grew up/what kind of household you grew up in. I mean for every single person to tell you everything was your fault, you'd have to be living in a pretty messed up place... Was it just family or others too?

Also, how old are you now? I mean to say like how many years have you been living without everyone saying that all the time?

And yeah sometimes you don't notice your own unique positivity because you're so used to it."

For reading stuff I agree that 1200px height is better than 1080px.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390503150.0,"Yes, democrats can be for the rich too, but let's go back to 2011, which is the year I really switched my outlook in general.

The republicans campaigned on balancing the budget. Obama was a big spender, and admittedly, he did a lot of crazy spending from 2008 to 2010. Heck, I even voted for the GOP this election cycle and soon regretted it. 

So then they get elected, and start pressuring Obama for a better budget. But honestly, the republicans were completely closed to compromise at all. They proposed TONS of cuts on social programs and the like, but when Obama asked for a slight tax increase that would only impact 2% of the population, they flipped. They freaked out, they shut down the government, they obstructed, and they've thrown temper tantrums for the next 3 years. 

Meanwhile, my dad is on unemployment, having lost his job largely due to some corporate shuffling, and here are these jerks who are proposing kicking people off of unemployment and yelling the same old ""GET A JOB YOU LAZY MOOCHER"" line on Fox news and crap (even though he's in his 60s and paid into unemployment his whole life), and ugh, it was just sickening. Quite frankly, if it weren't for Obama extending unemployment, my family would've been in MAJOR trouble, since the job market is awful around here and it took him a year to find a new job, and here's a party that would kick my family to the street while defending to the bitter end some rich guy's ability to be taxed at 35% instead of 39%? Yeah, I'm gonna say the republicans are out for the rich more than the democrats. Obama talked of shared sacrifice, that if we are going to make budget cuts we will need to also have some tax increases as well, and the  republicans opposed it. Heck, when push comes to shove, and they have to choose between a balanced budget and defending a rich guy's tax cuts, they'll take the latter, especially looking back at the Reagan and Bush administrations which had MASSIVE deficits as well. 

And quite frankly, that is what  really pushed me to liberalism. I'm sorry, but conservatism in the modern age is toxic. We're in the middle of a  major economic crisis, and I really get the impression republicans would throw the American people under the bus, hurting millions on all forms of government assistance, to protect the rich. The democrats may be part of the 1%, they might at times have pro corporate policies, but to argue the two parties are the same just isn't true. 

Also, i agree, Ike and Nixon weren't perfect (especially Nixon), but honestly, I think the pre reagan conservatives were a lot more respectable on ideology alone than the post reagan ones. And in recent years, they've just become radical and unwilling to compromise an inch. I can't have any part of a political party that would hurt millions ofthe most vulnerable people, especially in the middle of a recession when they need help most. "

Loindsey,Fitness,1390503181.0,"Hi, there. I am an opera singer and voice teacher. I have asthma (though not severe) and have had students and teachers who suffer from it as well. My teaching and personal studies focus a lot on breathing technique and I am an expert on breath management. I have a few exercises that I'm confident can help you.

First you must find the correct posture for efficient breathing. 

Ex. 1 - While standing, inhale silently though your nose while stretching upward toward the ceiling with both arms. Exhale silently while bring your arms back down to your sides and maintaining the noble, uplifted posture of your chest. Repeat several times alternating between breathing through your nose and mouth. Silence while breathing is important because it means your airway is not obstructed by unnecessary muscle tension.

Ex. 2 - Lie down flat on your back with a textbook or flat pillow lightly elevating your head to maintain alignment with your spine. Place one hand flat on your xiphoid (the end of your sternum just above your stomach), and the other hand flat on your belly button. Inhale and exhale silently (again, emphasis on the silent). Concentrate on feeling which muscles release and stretch to allow room for your lungs to expand. Your chest should not rise and fall, because as your lungs expand, they push downward toward your pelvic region, which causes your waist to expand in circumference as your organs are displaced. After a couple of minutes, stand up and do your best to mimic the posture you had while lying down, this time placing the hand that was on your xiphoid onto your side to feel your lower ribs (other hand is still on your belly button). Continue to breathe silently, concentrating on the movement of your abdomen and the lower back of your rib cage. 

Practicing silent breathing in itself is an exercise, because it requires you to garner concentration and some breath control. 

To increase lung capacity and endurance, practice the following exercises. 

Ex. 3 - In your best posture for breathing (see above exercises), inhale silently and exhale on the sibilant ""S."" The ""sssss"" sound should be very soft, barely audible. Maintain for as long as you possibly can. Repeat several times for about 2 minutes daily. If you feel tension in your chest, shoulders, neck, or back, you are doing it wrong. Lying down with your head slightly elevated can help to correct the problem. The prolonged expiration (exhale) process will strengthen the muscles involved with that phase of the breath cycle and will ultimately help with endurance and capacity. 

Ex. 4 - This exercise involves the 3 phases of the breath cycle: 1, inspiration (inhaling), 2, Suspension (holding your breath), and 3, Expiration (exhaling). While tapping a steady beat with your finger, inhale silently to the count of 5, suspend breathing for 5, then exhale slowly for 5. Please note that while holding your breath, your throat must stay open and relaxed. You do not want to feel any breath pressure in your throat at all. Repeat this measured breathing pattern from 5 all the way up to 10. When you get to around 7 or 8, you may need to take in little sips up air during the suspension phase to maintain capacity. Do not be hard on yourself if you cannot complete the 5 or 6 count, yet. This exercise builds capacity and strength over time. Repeat daily.

If you have any questions about these exercises, or are interested in learning more, I will do my best to answer clearly."

My friend said it well, I am sure he didn't make it up but, they are all living rent free in your brain.  Making their actions the root of your personal issues gives them all of the power.

Let it go.  Your resentment won't make them change, there is never going to be an aha moment for them where they come to you and apologize for all of the wrong that they have done.  They will likely be as indifferent to your freedom as they are to your caging.

wordserious,AskReddit,1390503219.0,"Let me simplify and call tv, movies, and theatre ""literature."" All of those things are communication tools. So yes, the characters, plots, situations and events are all dreamed up by someone; but in good literary work, they serve the purpose of transmitting a message - and the message is real. Winston Smith doesn't exist, and neither does Agent Smith. But 1984 and The Matrix are not just entertaining; they transmit somebody's idea into our heads. We become more aware of issues about totalitarianism and censorship and the application of power and many others. The messages are real.

The events unfolding during a game are real. The players are real people with real human limitations and extraordinary athletic abilities and what happens to them is real. But there is no message. What's at stake *for me*? For the spectator? That's what I mean when I say that the drama is artificial. The plays are real, the events and characters are real. But the unscripted drama that you suggest is entirely made up. The only thing it can transmit is a very generic good feeling or bad feeling. No ideas. No real communication."

SlickKat88,WritingPrompts,1390503226.0,"I know it has been mentioned on a few other posts and subs, but I use [750words](https://www.750words.com) for my writing. I'll admit, since the first of the year I've only truly reached the goal three out of the now 23 days. But, after a few days, I realized that I *wanted* to at least try reaching the goal. So, each day, I grab a couple prompts and take them as far as I can.  
  
I figure, 750 words a day at an average of 28 days in a month, that's about 21000 words written in the whole month. So, I'm working towards this in the coming months.  Maybe have a decent length story by the end of the year.  
  
I've found that one of the best ways for me to write is to music. It takes some time for me to find songs that carry the beat/pace I need to keep my flow when writing, but once I have them, I'm an unstoppable machine! Plus, inspiration never hurts. Finding music that matches the moods and details I'm conveying is definitely a big help in being consistent on a piece. "
