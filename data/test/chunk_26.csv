After seeing people buy 8-core CPUs and/or overclock to futureproof, only to be trumped by superior architecture and newer hyperthreading technology, I feel like going with the best bang for your buck based on CPU application is the best way to go. Playing Skyrim? get a Haswell core-i3 and a GTX660 . Playing BF4? get a haswell core-i5 and a 660ti. Working for Pixar? get a Haswell i7 and use AMD Firepro.

It may sound less epic that way but I think the nature of the film is very dream-like and suggests that the religious motifs prevalent throughout should not be taken so literally.

She made the choice and she is the only one who made that choice.  If she comes to find she felt neglected by her husband, then her next step is to determine whether it was real or perceived neglect.  If it was real, the solution in the future is to talk to him about it and work with him to find ways to be intimate rather than cheating.  Nothing in that example puts blame on her husband.  The blame for cheating is still on her and now she has the responsibility of communicating her needs.  Her husband can in no way be blamed for her actions or even for neglect in a relationship if she did not communicate her needs to him.  Obviously there are more things to consider in fixing this relationship, but it's really erroneous to say someone who has cheated in the past can't change if he or she really wants to. "

On leash dogs are worse, IMO. People let their on leash dog just walk right up to my on leash dog and do a greeting all the time.

Yes but semi-ignore the lectionary. Just read entire books straight through. If you want to read the books that are current in the Sunday or the weekday cycles, fine. But excerptizing is the surest way to lose sight of the whole.

2) Emphasize a personal relationship with Jesus more

What is this ""personal relationship with Jesus"" people keep talking about?

3) Develop a testimony

You mean a spiritual autobiography? If you can't articulate the short version while waiting for the bus then you don't have one.

4) Be involved more in politics

You mean inconsequential flamboyant statements published in the Catholic blogosphere, or do you mean actively infiltrating the Demoncratic Party?

5) Display more hospitality at the parish level

Certain people should be barred from speaking to newcomers at coffee &amp; donuts in the church basement. Certain others need to attend a workshop on saying hi to people they don't know. This is a complex sociological question.

6) Use small groups more

Are we talking prayer circles or *Communautés de Base*?

7) Use the ""cry room"" more

The sanctuary is the ultimate cry room. For children too.

8) Have more regular musical/adoration worship services

I don't understand this question. You mean more music, or more adoration?

9) Talk about tithing more

Twice a year, once on the Sunday in the Octave of April 15, the other when it comes up in the readings.

10) Do more to welcome new parishioners

Less. One of the parish priests, the deacon, and the parish secretary should each make personal contact with new parishioners separately. These three should already have their fingers on the pulse of parish life and be in a position to suggest ways to get more involved.

11) use electronic media to access readings

The internet already has done this.

12) [priests] be more approachable on faith questions

If this is a question then it is its own answer. A priest *not* approachable on faith questions should find another career.

13) Find our what talents people have and put them to use

A brief invitation during parish announcements should suffice.

14) Verse memorization

My lady has nueropy, and I have carpal tunnel and tennis elbow, so it had to be something that was pretty much drop proof. She named it Cookie Monster."
Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389342342.0,"I dated my ex for a year. 6 months in I wanted out and was about to break it off until numb nuts lost his job. So I wasn't going going to play bad guy and have him lose his job AND break up with him. 

So for 6 months I helped him find work and after about 6 months I give him a lead and he lands a job. Well, one night we're alone and I'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, thinking if there was a way to salvage the relationship. I'm watching TV, trying to get him to watch with me as he's doing laundry. Well, lo and behold he finds a $100 dollar bill he had forgotten about in a pants pocket and immediately calling people up trying to get a bag of weed. At 2:00 in the morning. 

That was reason enough to remind me why the relationship wasn't worth salvaging was because in the end, weed and alcohol were more important than me. I walked out on him that night after telling him that ""I haven't been happy for a while.""

We stayed apart for a little bit, but both decided to try the ""Lets be friends thing."" Yeah, I'm a fucking idiot. 

It worked for a short while and I appreciated him more as a friend than a lover, I will admit. Well my mother knows he likes football and got the bright idea to invite him over for Superbowl Sunday and throws a small party. All goes well at first... however it was the first time I saw his alcoholism at its finest. 

He bought 6 forty ounce beers, and drank 5 of them. Polished off about a quarter of a 750ML bottle of cooking sherry, had a few shots of whiskey with my father, the last of our vodka (my mom uses vodka for cooking) which was about a shot and a half and he was pretty much toast after that. 

IT took my mother and myself both to practically shove him out of the house and into the car and drive him home. I think I forgot to mention to, I was a substitute teacher at this point. I was on call and if I was to be called in I would be called at 5 in the morning. It was now 1:30 am. 

Well, we get him home, I get showered and get in bed, praying I'm not called in tomorrow when I get a call from him. He wants me to come over for a booty call. I tell him I may have to work, so ""NO,"" and tell him good night. I hang up. 

I got to bed, am about half asleep and I get another call from him. He's walking back to my house, IN TEARS, trying to guilt me back into his life. Also, because he forgot a beer at my house. 

I throw on a robe, grab his goddamned beer and wait on my back porch for him to show up. IT's 20 degrees out and he is so drunk he doesn't even have a coat on. I was livid and I handed him back his beer and gave him my answer: ""_____, you want my answer? You want my HONEST answer!? I am not sacrificing MY LIFE for a pot-riddled alcoholic."" - I stormed inside and he, at 3 AM, starting screaming obscenities at my house. I had to wrestle the phone away from my mom begging her not to call the cops as he didn't need more shit on his record. 

The next day he didn't remember anything and it took a few neighbors and his roommate to fill in the gaps. 

I stopped talking to him pretty much after that. And I as I would later learn, he had left out some key details on his criminal record, oh, and that job I helped him get? Yeah, he was fired a year later charged with grand larceny. 

**TL;DR: My ex was addicted to pot (it is possible) and alcohol. I ended up calling him a ""pot riddled alcoholic"" and walked out of his life.**

Just because you've played in bands doesn't mean you are an expert on hearing protection. If the drummers ears are subject to high SPLs, (and trust me, they are if the whole stadium can hear them,) they should be wearing protection or risk suffering hearing loss. 

Clearly you don't give a shit, but some people do. Do a little research on it and you'll quickly see that /u/kapachow is right to be concerned for their hearing.

Saying that you don't need hearing protection outdoors is ridiculous. Yes, the sound isn't bouncing directly back at you, but neither is it in a rock stadium, and generally it shouldn't be in indoor rehearsals either if they're in a acoustically well-designed rehearsal room."

&gt; If we're talking a rock concert in a coliseum, yeah you should protect your hearing. With this kind of ensemble, not that big of a deal unless you're having an indoor rehearsal.

&gt; Source: Extensive percussive and music background. Currently a snare drum player for a 33 member drumline, part of a 345 member marching band at a Division I school with a top 5 ranked football team.

so your source is that you personally haven't experienced hearing loss that you're aware of.

how about some actual sources?

hearing loss is a threat starting at exposures to 90db.

According to [this article](http://www.acoustics.org/press/150th/Keefe.html), an outdoor drumline only rehearsal ranges from 94db to 105db depending on your position. Even the BEST case measurement was enough to cause hearing damage.

Bottom line: I don't care how long you've been playing drums, you aren't an acoustician and you're not in a position to talk about what causes hearing loss just because you play drums."

paul63,California,1389343036.0,"I really really fail to see how requiring 50% of the gun to be bright will kill your hobby. All you have to ask yourself is will it stop anyone who wants to buy and play airsoft from doing it? No. 

If the guns aren't more expensive, why would it reduce sales? If you think they'll be more expensive, why? Because the color of the plastic will change? Will the color affect the effectiveness? No, it won't. 

At the end of the day, the result of this will be all the same people who already play with toy guns just having to play with bright colored toy guns. 

The entire entire base of your argument is that airsoft guns will become more expensive because of this. Unfortunately, there is no evidence of this and capitalism greatly outweighs any assertion that this may be the case.

All of your other points are pointless. You say airsoft is safe and that no one gets injured playing it. So? Did anyone say anything to the contrary? Of course changing the color of the guns wouldn't be designed to make it more safe for the players, that would be stupid. This bill is being pushed through because a 13 year old was shot and killed for carrying a toy AK. Not because airsoft isn't safe. 

Did anyone argue that airsoft is bad? It's cool that it helps people with PTSD. Do you think that it will help them less if the toys are bright?

I'll assume that you have already down voted me, because honestly, all it sounds like to me is that you don't want your fake gun to look less cool.

Also more out of market teams (Nashville/Carolina/Tampa Bay..etc) have been doing well these past few seasons and that is helping the game grow outside it's 'traditional' northern markets.

The winter Olympics also played a role, the [ratings](http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/news/story?id=4957570) in both the US and Canada were very high for the Gold medal game in 2010 with US viewership being 34.8 million which made it the most watched hockey game in the US since 1980 that's huge. 80 % of Canada watched the game by the way.

i will say that it's way harder for black people to find work in china although i'd argue that a) this is most noticeable because it's so damn overt whereas american corporate racism is, by law, subtle and b) chinese schools prefer white people over everyone, black, hispanic, or american chinese, because bosses think white people are easier to sell to parents. take that as you will.

chinese people watch american movies, loads of them, and consume all forms of american news and entertainment media, which is where they get their ideas about black people being the bad guys.

Usually rather quickly as well. So in reality, poor people (whether receiving assistance or not) are putting more of their income (as a %) than anyone else back in to the economy. If all social welfare programs were cut, the economy would fall apart.

djinnigirl,polyamory,1389343584.0,"A few years ago, I got a separation, then divorce, from my husband of five years. We were poly at the time, and I am still with the same poly family now as I was then, simply without him as a part of it.

A dear friend of mine was going through a breakup at the same time. As we often did, she and I settled together to commiserate, and, for the first time, she made me question my friendship with her. She was angry at me for feeling sad and broken up about the situation with my husband, and felt I had no right to feel lonely, afraid, angry isolated, heartsick... or any of the other perfectly normal, regular breakup feelings. According to her, I had no right to them, because I had other partners. It's not like her situation. *She* was totally alone, so she was entitled to those feelings. I was not, so in her mind, I wasn't.

Bollocks!

That's a load of tripe. Being in other relationships does not make a breakup any easier, hurt any less, or feel less terrible when you lose a partner. 

Those feelings are normal and healthy. I don't know what your situation is or why you broke up - and as always, your mileage may vary - but if your other relationship is strong, it's perfectly alright to say, ""Boyfriend, I feel terrible. I'm not happy about this breakup, and I'm hurting. I don't want to be a drain on you, or aim my negative feelings at you, but I do still feel these ways. I am going to take some time and space for myself to heal, but I am still here, and still loving you."" and then do just that. Spend a week or two getting your head on straight and re-assessing your place in life and your priorities. Then, hop back into your partnership with your boyfriend, in a much better place.

I wouldn't make any decisions about my sexuality/desired relationship model until I had done the above, were I you. Right now.. things are hard enough without questioning your very nature.

TL;DR: Relationships are hard, breakups are hard, you have a right to your feelings and if you can communicate successfully, you will likely find yourself in a better place after taking some time to heal. Decide if you still fell poly then. :)"

- The pose and the clothing are good

The things that could be better:

- The orange Gel is much to bright. The Pose is all wrong for equal light on both sides of the face. (Needs to be more head on)
- The Red gel makes the right ear way to red. Fix in post!
- The lighting just isn't very good.. 
- The background is unatractive.
- A tad heavy on sharpening/clarity for my preferance.

Tips to improve: 

- Darken unatractive backgrounds to hide it. (Shorter shutter-time to cut ambient light)
- Focus light on one side of the face, and just use some slight fill on the other side. (Short or broad light, not both!)
- Compose without cutting of the head.

- In general:  Read up on classic portraiture-lighting, learn about rembrandt, loop, butterfly, broad and short light. (Check out http://blog.snapfactory.com/?page_id=2228 for some good video-guides)"

Going from this to a Haswell desktop processor, you should see a huge leap in performance.

I have yet to hear about any Haswell i5 much less a Haswell i7 bottlenecking anything. The jump in efficiency from 3rd gen to 4th gen is more significant than you'd think. Haswells are blistering fast. The i3's look like they're going to put AMD's FX-series (aside from the $400 FX-9###) in the toilet.

Quite frankly I don't like your deck that much, you have very few early minions and rely mostly on spells for removal, most of which will overload you quite heavily. Nat Pagle in addition to 2 Mana Tides is gimmicky at best and with just a single Defender of Argus and one Earth Elemental your Mana Tides will be easy pickings for enemy creatures. Malygos falls into a similar gimmick category, especially as you will need many of your spells to maintain boardcontrol early on, leaving not much use for the big spellpower boost in the late game.

Against Warlock Murloc you will probably fare well as their creatures are small and will die easily to many of your spells. I doubt it would be that easy against other variants.

For reference: [This is my deck](http://www.hearthhead.com/deckbuilder#cMd67zbH7Mb37zuG7Mcb7Mdq7Mb67MRe7MaD7Mmf7MmU7zoG7Mmc7Mww7zya7Mdk7MwX8k)

I use Rockbiter/Stormforge/Bolt and early Minions to get board control and use my later minions to beat the enemy down. Earth Elemental unfortunately is a liability at the moment as so many players are running Black Knights, I thought about replacing it with a Faceless Manipulator. 

Matchups I fought most during the last week or so:

* Warlock Murloc: With a decent hand it is possible to keep them very contained, if I draw a Lightning Storm it's usually GG, I would say I win about 65/35.

* Warlock Curi Variant: Very hard matchup, even more dependent on drawing a Lightning Storm.

* Aggro Mage: Flat out destroys my deck. As Shaman has no decent heals and most of my boardcontrol comes from attacking with my hero I just can't keep out low HP regions to survive.

* Freeze Mage: Much petter prospects than Aggro Mage but still not a great matchup. I would say about 35/65.

* Druid Control: About 50/50 Matchup, depends a lot on who draws better.

* Rogue: Also quite draw dependent, I would say slight advantage on my end as they often don't run many big creatures so my endgame is stronger.

* Paladin: If he can draw out the game to heal himself up again I can just lose to attrition. But overall a favorable matchup."

The majority of the time that I'm not into someone it's not something he can fix, so nothing productive can really come of it. It just puts me on the spot and either I tell the truth and it's uncomfortable for me and hurts his feelings, or else I make something up to let him down easy and it's just useless. 

Another thing is that some dudes will ask a question like that in order to argue with the lady in question and try to convince her to change her mind. /r/creepyPMs is full of examples of this. So even though that is not *your* intention she may be wary about that possibility. "

Imagine if the carrier sent there were crewed primarily by Germans or Poles, and a serious shooting war broke out. How on Earth would a German/Polish politician be able to justify the loss of life of their citizens in a cause which doesn't concern them in the least?

A unified military requires that the policy positions of the state controlling it be reflective of at least a decent chunk of its members.

Now that I've been on hormones for just over 7 months now I've become much more comfortable with myself and relaxed about everything.

thrownawayaccount1,polyamory,1389345523.0,"I don't have any stories for you presently. But I'll tell you what I tell myself. Take what you can from it, I sometimes do.

You have a negative emotion, one that doesn't feel good. Take some time to be sad, give yourself permission to be human. Ask your boyfriend if he feels like you are a drain, if he does then take some time to yourself, or ask for the support you need. Be aware if his honest response is what you are looking for. The world is full of people looking for the same things you are. Reddit is a place where I have found that more often than not. 

I also like to ask, how is this emotion trying to take care of me (I think I learned that from Ethical Slut). At the end of a relationship, it is normal to feel like someone died. It never becomes ok, it just become part of who you are.

Now might be also a good time to meditate on why you are poly. Remembering why you make your choices often helps reinforce whatever lesson may come from when things don't go your way."

bemundolack,IWantToLearn,1389345946.0,"I read and write poetry. This may not work for you like it did for me, but I really enjoy feminist poetry and poetry written by women (probably because feminism is something I'm passionate about regardless of poetry). [Aunt Jennifer's Tigers](http://writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/rich-jennifer-tiger.html) is a really good one, kind of a good starting place for poetry analysis, too. Analysis is what MAKES poetry for me. Rarely is a good piece of poetry meant to be taken at face value. It's always possible to go too far, but don't be afraid to do it, anyway. Going too far with analysis will bring you good ideas sometimes.

As I was typing this, I thought about it, and poetry is usually the most powerful when it's in context. Think about books or television or movies where you've caught snippets of poetry being quoted, and go look up those quotes and their authors. Like, I didn't really get jazzed about Aunt Jennifer's Tigers until I read The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. And I wouldn't have cared about Nothing Gold Can Stay by Robert Frost without The Outsiders.

Also, poetry is better when you know the author and why they wrote it at whatever point in their lives. Getting to know living poets is even better. Join a poetry club or something, get to know people and have open mic nights with them. In the writing club at my university, this guy wrote a poem talking about how he's been kind of lucky in life and not had a lot of hardship, and the way that makes him feel when he meets people who he ends up being close to that have had a lot of hardship. ""I need two black eyes and a kick in the stomach. I will carry that pain for you."" (not a direct quote, but that was the gist of it.) That poem hit me really hard because I knew the person who wrote it, knew his situation, and it provided insight for me into a very private part of his life.

Good art is personal and real, and poetry is no exception."

During his turn I already had my tactic for the next turn planned out, ping that minion, play that card etc. So at the start of my next turn I topdeck Frost Bolt and yes, you guessed it, started by pinging that fricking minion as I had planned out earlier. 2 Seconds later I was cursing in front of my computer.

pizzaandburritos,seduction,1389346014.0,"If OP wants to actually date people and not just flex his pickup artist muscles as you are so eager to do, he has to realize that girls like to have more information than just how hot and alpha you are when you approach them. There is a big difference between picking girls up at the club and finding girls in your regular life who you can date. I think you are making a lot of assumptions about OP's priorities. 

I was referring more to situations where you know someone somewhat already and become friends via facebook. I think it can be a good tool for building rapport in that situation. Sure, personal interaction is more ideal, but here's the thing. If you rely on personal interaction alone, you have to remember that most of the women you encounter are not women you encounter regularly. Absent the chance to interact with them regularly, you have to hit on them straight away, since it's your only opportunity. If you just want to get laid, this strategy is ok. Some women will respond favorably, and you'll get laid, but most women will react by wanting nothing to do with you in the future. And, of course, the pool of women you can hit on with this strategy is small compared to all the women you have access to, because you obviously can't just hit on everyone. In the case of friends, classmates, coworkers, etc who you have to have some sort of rapport with anyway, fb can be a good way of seeing if it could go the next step, without you being inappropriate by prematurely asking them out. 


So, like I said, facebook is not a tool for meeting women. It's not a tool for picking up women. It's definitely not an alternative to meeting women in real life. But it can be a tool for building acquaintances you already have into potential dates. 


And I still stand by what I said about it being a good way to get information. Even though you have determined that I would reject guys because of a lack of attraction, somehow I think that I might know more about why I reject guys than you, a random stranger on the internet. And for instance, if I were to witness you talking like you do in your post, or writing this way on facebook, I would be very turned off. So maybe in your case it is better if you don't use facebook, since it will expose your misguidedness.  "

Now realize that this goes for all girls and all other people and you start to see what kind of clusterfuck we're all a part of.

My point is, you can't really tell what will happen and you should take that as a consolation that *you're probably going to be fine*.

DuckyFreeman,Autos,1389346291.0,"Well, first of all, cars do not scan 360 degrees (Googles cars do not count). Even if they did, the challenge is not in retrieving the data, but utilizing it. The human mind can make decisions based on things beyond the scope of modern computers. Like whether or not the driver looked in his mirror or turned his head first, turn signals and brake lights, previous driving trends (even over the last few minutes), etc. 

The guy one car length in front of you and one lane to the right is following a driver 3 car lengths in front of him, and suddenly the front driver blows a tire and begins to swerve. You see the driver to your right slam on the brakes and look in his mirror. Your brain collects all of this information, and you begin reacting accordingly. Slowing down, and looking for openings in traffic to your left in case you need somewhere to go, because you know the driver to your right is moments from swerving into your lane. A computer can't analyze that information and make that same decision, not yet. The computer doesn't know what a blown tire is, it doesn't know how people react to a suddenly uncontrollable vehicle, it doesn't know how people react to people reacting to an uncontrollable vehicle. And for a long time, we won't have the computing power or the right algorithms to make those decisions. The highest levels of DARPA have created vehicles (air and land) that can make basic decisions in controlled environments. But even they can't manage to create a vehicle to handle LA traffic without a driver. "

steve496,49ers,1389346527.0,"Not as much as you might think.  Getting the run going is always a good thing, but realistically: their strength is the run defense.  It may be a long day for Gore and the running game.  But, with Vernon, Boldin, and Crabtree all healthy, we should be able to make some progress against their (somewhat less formidable) pass defense.  Its worth remembering that in our first matchup, we were moving the ball decently until Vernon got hurt, dropping us down to one real receiving threat.  This game we should have all 3.

Really, I expect our offense will look a lot like it did against the Cardinals week 17 - they're another team with a stifling run defense but a less dominant pass defense.  The Panthers defense is arguably even better than the Cardinals, so we probably won't score a lot of points; but the Panthers offense isn't as explosive as the Cardinals offense, either, so hopefully we won't need to."

The combat works about as well as it can with a sideways Wii remote, and the linearity of the gameplay helps to create a cinematic story. Unfortunately, the tone of the game (as well as a fair bit of translation issues) ruined the experience for a lot of Metroid fans.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389346716.0,"&gt;men certainly weren't expendable

Men are always expendable because of math.  

Imagine there is a tribe with 100 people, 50 men and 50 women.  They go to war with a tribe with 100 people.  It's a brutal war that last a whole summer. When it's over 15 of their men have died, and 25 of the other village's men have died.  5 of their women have died, and 30 of the other tribe's women were captured.  Of the remaining 15 women of the other tribe, 8 more died.  The other tribe was forced to flee the area and resettle elsewhere.

Now the victorious tribe has 35 men and 85 women.  The losing tribe has 25 men and 7 women.  Assuming each woman can bear 4 children that survive to adulthood, in one generation the victorious tribe now has 340 people, and the losing tribe has 28.  Because 35 men can impregnate 85 women by taking multiple wives, but only 7 of 25 men can impregnate 7 women.

That's why men are expendable.  If you need to rebuild a tribe and make a bunch of babies, one man is as good as dozen. "

MotivationToControl,changemyview,1389346843.0,"&gt;C'mon, he's obviously saying that implementation doesn't work with Socialism on a large scale because it doesn't take into consideration human psychology.

That doesn't pan out, given the fact that he said that he doesn't ""see a working implementation for another few decades at a minimum."" This clearly means that there is [edit: potentially] a ""working implementation"" in his view. It's just not viable at the moment, in his view.

You're story has nothing really to do with socialism, but everything to do with the problems small business owners and wage earners face in capitalist society. Socialism is not about raising the minimum wage at the expense of business owners... it's about eliminating the wage system and employer/employee dichotomy entirely.

What you are criticizing is a planned, centralized economy (such as existed in Vietnam before they opened markets), which isn't the only form of socialism.

I can completely relate to the partner thing. Mine and my room mate can both eat enough for two people or more (and often do) yet stay stick thin. It makes it a littler harder to remember to not eat loads. Though, if you keep up eating less your body should adjust and get used to only eating that much. It helps if you eat slowly as it gives your body time to realise you're getting full before you do. There are loads of delicious healthy foods out there, I imagine if your partner found some he liked it would make meal time easier as you can eat together. (:

pizzaandburritos,dating,1389348100.0,"I say give it another date or two. Chemistry can be fluid. You have to figure out whether the lack of chemistry was due to nerves and awkwardness. The disappointment of the kiss sounds like a product of the nervousness. Awkwardness is a huuuuuuuuge mood killer, I know. And guys that seem over eager to please are also a turnoff. Try to get him to relax.  

Now the thing is, when you say there was a lack of chemistry, are you saying you just weren't really attracted to him? Or is that you felt awkward, the conversation was bumpy, and so on? If it's the latter, I say definitely give him time because skype conversations indicate that that will improve when he relaxes. 

If it's about a lack of physical attraction, that can be a tricky subject. Physical attraction often grows out of the emotional connection. When you would skype with him, would you think about kissing him and stuff like that? Because if so, then it doesn't really matter if he's not really your type physically...you're obviously into him romantically. 

When you saw him in person, were you turned off by him physically? Or were you just disappointed that you didn't feel a bigger spark? I think there's a big difference between the two. "

Men don't say crazy to invalidate a woman's emotions. Men have emotions too; they are not an unfamiliar, alien thing. Men say a woman is crazy to indicate when she's behaving in unacceptable ways because of her emotions. Feeling a little jealous because he's hanging out with a pretty girl he's friends with and having a rational conversation about boundaries. The vast majority of men will find this understandable and acceptable. There will always be a few self centered assholes who think any concerns from you are unwarranted, but those are rare. Blowing up his phone and threatening her by Facebook. Crazy pants. You are the girlfriend every guy dreads having.

fortuna_spins_you,AskMen,1389348690.0,"I realized something after I already posted this. All these laws are done for what is felt is in the best interest of the child. It is called child support, not single mother support. Whether or not that is how the money is used is an entirely different story.

It's a complicated issue. If both parties are equally responsible for the creation, the only person it seems who can opt out of the responsibility, unless abortion and adoption are involved, is the father. And abortion and adoption are not just simple choices to make. Ultimately, the burden is on the woman. At this point, I think court logic is, you chose to take this risk, who need to share the consequences. It is more than just a money issue, it is raising a child, something that is difficult to do with two parents, let alone one.

Meanwhile, what if the father claims to want to be involved and then right before birth ""opts out"" leaving the mother in a situation she never intended? What if during intercourse he lies about using protection? Let's be honest, someone who leaves their partner in this kind of situation is probably not a particularly good person.

I don't know the statistics but I'm curious how many much money is involved when it comes to child support. It's a certain percentage of income but it also requires someone to hire a lawyer (which gets expensive) and take the time to fight someone in court. I really don't know much about the issue but I don't think it is as simple as someone gets pregnant and they automatically receive money. Although, that's a separate issue.

Obviously, it would be awesome if we just lived in a world where every child born was wanted by their parents.

Edit: Forgot a key point."

Greggor88,TumblrInAction,1389349007.0,"Actually, as a proud Russian shitlord myself, I can tell you Russians really are racist. There are two basic varieties of Russian racism.

There's the fiery hatred displayed by Russian neonazis and white power groups such as the [Russian White Wolves](http://en.ria.ru/russia/20100225/158004795.html) — their website has been taken down, but you can still find videos of their murders online. It was almost like a game to them. They would find dark-skinned or even dark-haired people at night and see how much damage they could inflict on that person's body before others began to notice. I still have friends in Moscow who tell me that Russian gangs are commonplace. They wear various colored shoelaces on their footwear to signify how many black/arab people they've killed.

Then there's the cold, tacit hatred felt by a substantial portion of the Russian populace. It doesn't manifest itself in violence, but more of a general contempt for darker skinned people. It's more of a feeling of superiority than rage. I grew up in a very liberal Russian household, but even my gentle grandparents were casual with their racism. It's difficult to explain. They felt like it was obvious that black people were unintelligent, slovenly, and prone to violence. They were really confused at how shocked I was to hear it. But they never wished ill to anyone.

Remember, your votes are the bullets in this war. Every time you check that little box in support of the 2nd, you are laying down suppressive fire. Evert time you vote against an anti-rights legislator, you are aiming center mass right at their job.

 Its work. Its hard work, but we are all in this together. You are in the shit right now, but we're all working at this, and we here in the other states have your back. Everyone else with the means to do so is donating money to every organization that will take it to fight this battle in the court rooms.

Just a little while ago the game studio I had my internship at went bankrupt even though they spent 3 years to make an amazing polished game.

ctesibius,AskHistorians,1389350340.0,"U-boats: suicide was not intended, but this was a hazardous operation as unlike the battleships, a submarine is equipped to sink very fast and has few exits. As the Royal Navy was required to retrieve any code books (which would give the day settings for the Enigma or Liebnitz machine) it was sometimes the practice to shoot at the evacuating crew with rifles to force them back into the hull, with the intention that they should reverse the scuttling. Note that their surrender had not been accepted at this point, so this was not necessarily in conflict with the rules of war. This attempt to capture the code-books first succeeded with [U-110](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_submarine_U-110_(1940\)#2nd_patrol_and_capture), captured by HMS Bulldog in 1941 (not the fictional U-571 of a USAian film).

Scapa flow was a more civilised affair. The scuttling took about an hour and a half before the ships started to go down, but this was not noticed by British observers until that point. There was some shooting for similar reasons, but this was sparse and unorganised. One person appears to have died."

Neopopulas,dayz,1389350373.0,"I've said it before and i'll say it again, adding even the smallest RPG elements to the game would help a lot. Suddenly if you run across someone who was, pre-zombies a medic.. and the people in your group were hunters or carpenters or mechanics, suddenly keeping this guy around (and healthy, and cooperative) is a good thing, because he can patch you up better.

And you can fix his car, or his shack, or you guys have more food. Suddenly, everyone isn't just a murder machine waiting for a reason to kill you, suddenly you need other people because you can't do everything on your own. Because right now you can. Everyone can do anything, there is no NEED to have friends to cooperate with.

The only way to make KOS not a thing (lets say less of a thing because sometimes its needed) that is always on everyones mind is to make everyone more valuable to everyone else, currently, you are only worth the gear you carry, and if someone has a reasonable idea that they could take it from you, then you might just be worth more dead, because they WERE on their own, they can survive on their own, so killing you, taking your stuff and continuing on alone would only be easier than it is now.

The fact you can't saline/bloodbag yourself (while a little weird) is a good example, you NEED someone to help you in that sense - i once saw someone literally hold someone at gunpoint so he would saline him. Not because the guy wouldn't help, but because he was SO PARANOID that this gearless guy would try and kill him.

That is also the problem. I've been attacked by more people without gear, than with gear. Because people without gear have nothing to lose, you have everything they need, they risk little attacking you, and you risk everything. The amount of people trying to punch or axe me as fresh spawns to take my gun is MUCH higher than those that shoot at me for it, because they already HAVE a gun, after all.

This is also why i would kill for some sort of group option in game. Not only would it be able to pinpoint your friends in the area (less friendly fire is good, and if you want to know why i think a HUD or tag of some kind that shows who is in your group/a friendly is important and authentic to the experience i'll happily go into it) but also allows you to form a connection with your fellows, maybe a group is what allows you to get into someone elses pack, that way you can have someone cover you while you give them ammo and take saline out to save your buddy.

But i've wandered off topic. At this point in Alpha, it is not surprising that the features and content are low, lets all agree that is neither surprising, nor bad (it just shows its alpha), and its totally a problem at the moment, i hope that, as time goes, there are meta and in-game reasons to be less shooty and more friendly. Some way to easily trade - i would love to set up a trading post, i just need some guards - and so on would help a lot, but generally a way, a meta reason, an In-Game cause for people to NEED other people is what is required."

The reason we've thrown a thread up about this is because we want feedback. We have over 100,000 subscribers. There's only 17 of us mods and some of our subscribers are pretty intelligent people. To think that we've come up with every solution is a pretty limited view on our part so we wanted to see what the community thought.

Our belief has always been that the topic submitter is a stand-in for anyone with the same view. That's why we allow people other than the submitter to award deltas. So if three people post the same thread, really they could all be in one thread and still have the same discussions, same deltas, same everything. There's no reason they each need their own thread. But if you see a reason why that is false, we'd like to hear it.

We do clear out duplicates when they come from throwaway accounts. We do this partially to help keep quality (throwaways that repost usually have spammy threads) and partially just so we're not flooded with the same topic over and over.

So, why do you think we need 10 topics on feminism/TRP/homosexuality/etc all running at the same time? Convince us that what we're considering is a bad policy and we won't implement it.

Neopopulas,dayz,1389350722.0,"Ineffective* (sorry, i had to). My problem with guns is that they are ineffective at LONG range. Maybe its desync, maybe its lag, but my M4 is absolute crap, even with an Acog scope, at more than 100m, i'm no expert but it seems like that is way to short to be that bad.

I hear tell its because guns have 'dispersion' and there is an artificial dispersion number that, no matter how much you aim, or how careful you are, it will always stray, which i just don't understand having in a game like this. I've done some tests, Lined up a zombie, prone, not moving, and the shot goes high and over to the right. The next shot, SAME position, crosshairs exactly the same spot, drops low and left.

Not being able to compensate for something like dispersion drives me crazy. It also explains why all anyone wants are Mosin's.

Also, again, i'm not expert but i would assume that guns are pretty effective in close range, unless you mean in melee combat, which you're right, they are shit - especially rifles - but if you're six feet away from me, they should be just as effective as they are at 40 feet.

The biggest problem with things like melee is there is no way to block or dodge, all you can do is run in awkward circles hoping not to get hit."

&gt;He would constantly become angry with me, leave me, and give me the silent treatment for days. Finally coming back after much pathetic begging and whatnot on my part.

Women don't want stability. They crave for drama. Learn from this man: if you want to enthrall a woman, duct tape her mouth shut and stick her on a rollercoaster.

&gt;Now I am a million miles away while he ignores me and continues to tell me he doesn't want to be with me and I continue my pathetic begging...Why would I even want to continue a relationship like this? It's not healthy, but yet here I am... the moment he comes back to me I will forgive everything. 

The best part is, people talk about co-dependence like it's some kind of uncommon affliction. But all you have to do is hit the right switches, and any woman of sufficiently low willpower (see: basically all of them) will be unable to ignore their urges, simply because they have no practice or evolutionary need to develop discipline.

It reminds me of a happier, simpler time in my life. Now if I drink it and I am alone I can almost feel the rays if sun coming through the dining room window flavoring my tea with the bittersweet memories of those days. 

One thing I do differently now though is I will smoke my pipe while drinking my tea. Some people prefer aromatic blends of tobacco which sent the air, however I personally have found a very flavorful, thick cut, Smokey tobacco at my local tobacconist that compliments the flavor of my tea perfectly. Sometimes when I am only wanting to relax I will simply stare off into the distance with my tea and my pipe.

clairebones,TwoXChromosomes,1389352396.0,"Sorry OP, but I think you're both in the wrong in places here. And his family's financial status is not, and should not be, relevant.

He should definitely not be paying more for dates or dinner because 'that's the way it's supposed to be' or similar nonsense. You're both adults, if you can't afford to go on the date you shouldn't be doing it, unless he particularly offers. If I had to continually ask my SO to pay because they assumed I always would, I'd get pretty pissed off too. You paying 'a few dollars' while he pays for dinner every time isn't really fair on him. 

It seems like he offered to pay the holiday unprompted, so he perhaps feels like by asking for more money your family is trying to fund their holiday on his money, instead of just accepting that they shouldn't go if they can't afford it. If they had already told him that 400 would equal his share, I can see why he'd feel like the extra 200 dollars were going towards your parents' holiday because they couldn't afford it any more.

Your mum gave you money for the holiday, and I while i think he was wrong to take it, you should have told him where the left-over money was going so he knew not to spend all of it - this is why he was frustrated, he seemingly thought that this 200 was all spending money for the trip, and I imagine that if he'd know the truth he would have spent some of his own money. 

I think you are assuming that because his family is better off he should have more money to spend, but that is not correct nor is it your business really. You cannot assume that his parents are able to give him money the way your parents seem to be able to do.

Your parents' advice is incredibly old fashioned and also incredibly rude, and if you want a healthy relationship with *anyone* I'd suggest you not take it to heart. It is not one person's job to spend more than the other, or put in more effort than the other, unless they choose to - that is a very quick way to ruin a relationship."

Pros:

Cons:

 * IDEs will be re-designed to have even more toolbars and dockable tab boxes to that you still only get 80*60 for your code (by default)

Seriously, I hate this with a passion. I mean, if I'm editing code in an IDE, I want to see the code and that's it. Maybe I want to see the other files in the project/folder structure, but that's it. I don't need to see all of the myriad tabs, docks and tool bars that just take up space and limit my view of the code.

Much of the negativity you mention in comments was present as well - lots of complaining about work and it was never his fault for things that went wrong, for example. When all of this, in addition to a few other bits of information which were withheld from me, came to light, it got to be too much, and I left.

That's not to say that your relationship is doomed; we were a couple of years younger than you, we had only been serious for two months and marriage was not quite on the table for me in general. However, if at twenty-six your boyfriend is spending for the sake of having things and not using them, if he seems nonchalant about the idea of marrying you, and he continues to demonstrate no will or even passing thoughts of the future or mild self-improvement, I think you are going to have to critically evaluate what sort of life you want and whether you see him in it **as he is now**. Don't make my mistake of loving the potential of what he could be; you can't change a person unless they really want to change and there are no guarantees of that ever happening. His resistance to therapy, noncommittal remarks towards the future, etc. are not good signs.

If ultimately you need somebody that will strive to be better and push you to be better, then I'm sorry to say I don't have much hope for your relationship. Please do not compromise your happiness or your goals for this ~~man~~ boy when you could be so much happier single or with somebody else. If you feel it's worth it to keep trying, by all means, it's possible that this can work if he's willing to truly put in the effort and not just go through the motions, but please don't let him drag you down if further attempts get you nowhere."

His friends sound a bit bitter and probably made things worse. He didn't handle it very well, which is pretty common for guys his age. No it's not healthy, but it takes time and practice to develop healthy relationship skills, and he's just par right now for his age. 

You're not wrong here, he handled it badly. I can see why you have anxiety about this. But consider this: he may lack experience dealing with this. Does he actually have potential to improve his jealousy and how he reacts to situations like this? Or will he be 26 forever? (Not uncommon.) Does his past show he has improved other things before? Did he grow up being forced to be mature, or was he coddled most of his life? How he grew up is a key issue. 

We all have insecurities. But it's how we deal with them that determines if it will help or hurt the relationship.

gravvs,malefashion,1389353709.0,"Okay so here's why I think this fit is a little off even though the jacket is dope. 

The jacket fits in kind of a slouchy oversized way on you. The shoulders are wider than yours. This is fine but it means you need to account for it in the rest of the outfit. It's shape is a wide rectangle with rounded edges.

Your jeans are a straightforward fit. They're straight legged and fit 'perfectly.' They're even cuffed. They're shape is a thin flat rectangular stacked on another smaller rectangle (the cuffs).

Finally the boots are rounded. There's nothing rectangular about them. They have a curvy shape. Its shape is unlike anything else in the fit. 

So you have three different shapes going on. And they aren't meshing well. The first solution would be to have the jacket taken in. Get rid of the slouch vibe. If that isn't an option you have a couple alternatives.

You could run with the slouch vibe and wear some sloucher pants. Maybe some drop crotch jeans. At the very least uncuff those jeans and let the fabric bunch up around the boot.

Alternatively you could take weird proportions and shapes and run with that. I would recommend a pair of black slim/skinny jeans. Maybe even something you could lace the boots up over. Then the focus is on the big jacket and boots, and both have round features.

clairebones,AskWomen,1389354047.0,"If you don't mind me saying so, I think your issues are warping your view of what you're watching. In a legitimate BDSM scenario the dominant partner does not 'loathe' the submissive partner - it is a mutually desired, mutually agreed upon act that only worked because they respect each other equally, and there is no exploitation involved. 

Being submissive doesn't say anything about you other than what your preferences in the bedroom are, all you need is to find a girl who is interested in being sexually dominant. 

I would also recommend that, if possible, you go back to your therapist and continue to work on your own self loathing. There won't be an easy fix or 'cure' as it's something you need to come to terms with rather than something to 'get rid of', it will take time, but it's worth it."

Your peers will say that you should do it to look pretty; if this be the case; Please see point one.

**point two** if you want perminantly smooth legs you will have to do this 2-4 times a week and it will take 30 seconds (?) each time. Do you really want to waste 3.9 hours of your life looking pretty for no legal reason?


P.s. 3.8 hours is if found by the following (D*n)/W)S)T/H)

* where D = the number of days in a year
* n = the number of years taken 
* W = number of days in a week
At this point we have total of days on which shaving took place
* S = number of days a week on average spent shaving

What is |B-A| ? It's the absolute distance between the number A and the number B.

Now in higher dimensions, things aren't numbers they are vectors. The notation AB for the vector A ""to"" B is actually (B-A) ( easy to see/prove)

So what is |AB| ? ( where | | is the norm ) it's |B-A| i.e. the distance between A and B.

And what is the distance between A and B? The length of the line [AB] !

Understanding that |A-B| just means ""distance between A and B"" for whatever vector space and norm will make your life a lot easier: you'll be able to visualize most proof by drawing balls and spheres"

The gender issues is a difficult topic, and as much as I hate to say it, could this be why he is distant? It's important to know if that's what's putting him off because if so, you cannot stay with him and not be able to work through this. If he's just taking some time then be patient, I know it's hard but he hasn't had as much time to deal with it as you have and it is pretty scary for people who aren't knowledgable about it.

I would advise not 'chatting with guys' on hookup sites, that's not going to help your relationship at all. You need to have a conversation about why your sex life has fallen apart. 

I think it might be worth explaining to him that although you love him, you can't continue this **if he does not get help**. It's not that you are breaking up with him, but that you need him to get help for the sake of the relationship."

I think its pretty safe to say that calling all women lazy pieces of shit simply because they prefer confidence in their partners is a pretty crappy notion.

I can't speak for every woman, but I look for confidence in a man because I want someone who owns who they are. Someone who is secure in who they are as a person is much more likely to treat me with the same respect &amp; dignity. My own personal experience has taught me that an insecure partner is much more likely to treat me poorly, cast suspicions, and overall just make me feel like poop- even if its not intentional. 

As far as the first move stuff... either you're still in highschool (where basically no one has developed their social skills), or you are hanging with the wrong circle of friends. Or maybe they're shy. Or introverted. Or maybe they're out on the town and aren't looking to meet anyone, so they don't want to approach anyone. Or maybe they're not the kind to just walk up to someone in a bar because of a slew of really fucked up social implications.

I didn't come to this thread to hate on fat people, Fuck, I'm one of them. I have been posting what I know, without any intent to be deceitful. Nor am I getting to reward anything or body, what I'm talking about is a policy that is in place to help keep myself and my co-workers safe. Sure, there are emergencies, and shit happens, but what I posted earlier was related to the everyday, not the emergent.

Besides, that policy also covers the little 150lbs patient that falls in the bathroom. Instead of putting them on a flat sheet and grabbing 4 or 5 guys and just lifting, I would say 'wait a minute, this patient is already down, let me go get my Hovermat and Jack. We can put them on the mat, then slide them out into a more open area, then use the Jack to boost them up to a stretcher.' I am not an RN, and do not have to worry about all the JC paperwork. I am just a lift team member who's job it is to move people around the hospital safely. 

I agree that there is a fair amount of hate and embarrassment, but I have not been addressing either one of those points. I try to make all of my patients feel like I actually care about them, and get around any embarrassment. And as for inferior care, I don't see saying I don't feel comfortable doing this lift as inferior care. I am protecting myself at the same time as thinking about the patient.

Red Flag 1: She, a married woman, keeps contact with her exes

Red Flag 2: She badmouths you to her ex

Red Flag 3: She talks about sexual things with her ex

She somehow turns this upside down and you are the bad guy? Man the fuck up already or she will lose the sliver of respect she has left for you. 

My other advice is do not ask relationship advice on reddit. /r/relationship consists of these two demographics:

- Teenagers and 20-somethings that go ""YOLO"" and cheat, only way they can keep respecting themselves is by trivializing and defending cheating.
- 20-somethings that think divorce is fucking easy so they tell you to divorce at the slightest mistake on your SOs part.

bunker_man,Christianity,1389356585.0,"&gt; Church services trying to be 'cool' ultimately fail and have the opposite effect.

It seems like this is a severe problem, and one which at least in theory doesn't have to be. The problem is that old people's idea of cool is like acoustic guitars and things they thought were cool in 1963. This is not quite the radical overhaul that will be needed in order to actually generate a cool mentality. If they really wanted to know what makes church cool, why not start at the ideal source. Look into fiction, and see which fictional churches have cool aspects, and see what it is that makes them so.

mundabit,TwoXChromosomes,1389356651.0,"Liminting video games, computer time (non-homework related) and TV is a good move. This is the main method of discipline my dad uses on my brother. My brother and I are both introverts, we are happy being alone, so time-out never worked, we would often much up so we *would* be put in time out and not have to interact with people. I used to get the smack, because my hobbies involves sports and dad did not want to limit my exposure to exercise or make me see it as a reward-type event. My brother however would have his computer time limited. He was sneaky at getting on the computer when he wasn;t allowed, dad would have to go so far as to lock the PC tower in his car sometimes. But he never caves, he sets a time frame, ""no Computer for 3 days because of what you did"" and he sticks to it. My brother has not only learned to behave, but has also learned time-management skills, how to prioritise, and how to entertain himself without a media device. 

Regardless of when method you chose, *the* most important thing is to stick to your guns. It only takes a few times of caving in, or forgetting to follow through and you ruin that method, the kid will try and test the limits and play the system.

Berean_Katz,DebateReligion,1389356705.0,"I think the belief in an afterlife is a paradoxical mindset, more so than the obvious ""lack of evidence"" aspect. If theists (or whomever) truly believed in an afterlife, they would be absolutely overjoyed when they face life-threatening situations. They would probably even let themselves die so they could finally just get to good ol' heaven, skipping the formalities of ""worldly"" existence. Interestingly enough, regardless of their claim to truly believe in heaven, they still fear death. In any case, heaven is still a big sell for religions to perpetrate their ideas on people. That's one of the major reasons Christianity is still very popular. I have a good friend who literally said ""I gotta keep having faith--I wanna go to heaven when I die!"" That's fine! Believe what you want. But my concern is that people focus so much on the afterlife (an idea that may not even be true) that they forget to live the real life they have in the here and now. The hardest part to avoid is the idea of death of loved ones. This is very hard for people to accept, but we need to stop thinking of the possible afterlife they might have and remember the *actual* *lives* they lived. Second on this point is that how do you know they didn't end up in hell? You might say ""Because they were Christian,"" but what if God is actually Allah? That would mean that all Christians are going to hell. My belief? All afterlives are equally unlikely. If there is a heaven out there somewhere, that would be great (in some ways), but how do we *really* know what courses of actions to take to get there? What if in order to get there we have to be atheists? So instead of worrying about it, we can smile on the possibility, sure...but focus more of our passion and love on our current life."

Balieyez,AskMen,1389356776.0,"I get auras, which means I know anywhere from all day to as short as 5 minutes I'm about to have a seizure. My mom recorded me having a seizure once because I have no memory during a seizure. 9/10 times I have a full body seizure, never bit my tongue or lost control of my bodily functions. The worst seizure I ever had was also the most beneficial because it sent me to the hospital and they were able to determine they are non epiliptic. that seizure lasted about a half an hour and left me unable to walk for a few hours. I had another seizure while at the hospital and they were able to draw my blood and test for a chemical that is present after an epiliptic seizure. This chemical dissipates within 30 minutes from the body, so the fact I was in the hospital was crucial. 

For someone who has never seen someone else have a seizure, it can be terrifying. My current bf has yet to see one because I have been under control for some time now. But if you ever do see someone having a seizure, don't ever stick anything in their mouth to try to help, you can push their tongue back and make them choke and usually the person seizing will be fine without any intervention on your part.

After a seizure...I'm tired. I could sleep for hours and still be exhausted. my muscles hurt and I'm in a brain fog for a time. once that passes, I can go about my day like nothing happened."

They co-opt terms that don't apply to them. They take from the gender community because it is the only real struggle in their time, and use the rhetoric without any of the history. Things that trans people discuss, like the term ""trans"" and ""cis"" come from the medical community, and a lot of the angst toward doctors comes from a draconian set of rules set up by one guy, some of them are actively dangerous. That is to say, saying you disagree with your doctor because he wants you to live six months like a woman before he'll give you the hormones to comfortably live like a woman is a reasonable gripe.

Gender disphoria is a legitimate medical condition that has been recognized by the medical community. Left untreated, it causes depression or even suicide. It, like most psychological problems occurs as a result of your brain expecting certain chemicals and getting other chemicals.

There are legitimate problems facing the transsexual community, which is not something invented in their parent's basement. The media portrays transsexuals as sexual deviants, urging their careers towards prostitution. [With the exception of Orange is the New Black, of course]. Workplace support only caught up within the last handful of years, and still isn't quite there. Law enforcement is really terrible at respecting transsexuals."

However mini-pills (progesterone only) are safer than combination pills, and some formulations are more well known than others for lightening a woman's period (so less cramps) and some can help with skin. If you ask your doctor what types of mini-pills they would recomend for a woman with PCOS or PMDD, you will get a list of brands that are good for mood-stabalisation and skincare and lighter/less painful periods.

Minipills are a lot easier to take, there is no placebo week, you just take the same coloured pill every single day, so its hard to get mixed up. But that does mean you don;t have a handy reminder of when your period is due, and sometimes your periods can be irregular on them.

But you can go for a combination pill, just remember there is always going to be a bigger risk of clots, but if you are a non-smoker with a good diet, that is a minimal risk. again, ask what your doctor would recomend to someone nervous about mood and skin and cramps, they are going to be most helpful. The lower the estrogen dose, the lower the clot/stroke risk, so keep that in mind and maybe ask for some brands that are 20 micrograms of estrogen."

e-raja,exmuslim,1389357317.0,"I personally would advise against getting involved with a Muslim, even if he is 'Liberal', down the line eventually there is a chance he could end up doing a U-Turn and go full mufti. But it's entirely possible for him to be OK with non belief. That's a choice you'll have to make while you weigh things out.

In regards to your family, Do they strongly subscribe to the concept of Izzat and what others would think. If so, then you'll have to choose your happiness or theirs.

If they are westernised then you don't quite have that issue to deal with. 

I'm in a similar boat in that I'm desi, my family is not too fussed about izzat in regards to who I marry, but I'm a 100% sure shit will hit the fan with regards to the religious issue of potential wife. I'm personally don't feel happy basing a relationship on a lie, that's why I've completely ruled out keeping my apostasy hidden from a spouse if she is Muslim. Therefore I'd be surprised if I find a Muslim woman who accepts it.

What are you families reaction to interracial couples. As a desi lady you may have a lot more difficulty persuading your parents. But it all falls on how entrenched your family are with old world values.

Why is it 'terrible'? Besides the 'well it ruins immersion/realism because you can see a HUD' argument. If so i'll link you do the post there rocket explains the difference between 'authenticity' and 'realism' and which one he is going for.

The thing is, you ""should know what your buddy looks like' and you would, in real life. But in this game you lack a LOT of the triggers that people use in real life. The way you walk, the way you stand, the way you hold your gun, do you carry smokes in your vest? sunglasses? are all your mags upside down because thats the way you like to hold them.

There are not enough clothing options to use that either, my group have taken to all wearing the same bright colours banana. The thing is though, if you're running around with a gas mask or a banana or a helmet, if you're in fatigues, with a green vest.. there could be 20 people on your server who look, walk, stand, hold their gun and carry things absolutely identically. This lack of easy situational awareness means you really CAN'T just 'learn to recognize' your buddies, because the world is basically full of clones.

dgnarus,tumblr,1389358032.0,"I think people not liking the show mostly comes from the fact that they don't display nerds properly (and some terrible jokes, I'll give you that). But by saying this, you're making the exact same mistake as the creators of the show. They display every nerd as:

-loving all possible aspects of popular culture

-secluded and anti-social

-very smart and doing high-end jobs as, mostly, physicists (at least, this goes for 3 out of 4 male characters)

But what people say next is: ""Well, I'm a nerd and I'm nothing like that. This show is stupid. It doesn't do 'nerd culture' (p.s. what the actual fuck) any justice at all. REAL nerds don't ever *insert things that you personally don't do here*, they only *insert things that you personally do* every day!""

So, I can get the fact that you don't think the show shows how nerds really are, and that this creates bad prejudice against nerds in general, but the fact is, there is not one single thing that all nerds share, except being passionate about popular culture, and I think we can all agree that the show got that part down. 

Final words, give the show a chance. But don't look at it as a documentary on nerds. Look at it as a PARODY on nerds. Because that's exactly what it is."

So while conventional wisdom says I should ""play the field"" some more, it's not going to happen. I'm not going to throw away an incredible relationship for the sake of maybe finding something better. 

I think it also depends on personality, and what someone wants out of a relationship. Me, I want security, and someone to trust, rather than perfection. He wants the same, so it works. 

A while ago, I did have a few doubts about the same issue, and we talked about it. He's had a few girlfriends before me, and he says this is far and away the best relationship he has ever been in, with regards to communication, trust and all that. And I trust his judgement, so his comments soothed my doubts. "

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1389358187.0,"&gt;  In fact, I would argue if he was this DT narcissistic machine-fucker, he would be against seeking out the opinions of others on reddit, since sociopaths and narcissists typically are unable to take other people's opinions into consideration. They value other people's thoughts so low and they think it's one of their greatest strengths that they construct their own thoughts and ideas.

It's possible that he's bragging. It's not like any of us could do anything about it if it was real.

&gt; this guy apparently records facts about his stools everyday, as well as what he eats to the gram, his urine colors, and regularly gets his bone density checked and his bloodwork done professionally. Yet when everyone says ""get therapy"" he says he doesn't have the time or money.

He never said he has this done ""professionally"". Professional monitoring of ""emotional fluctuations"" isn't even a service. From the sound of it, he does this himself and trusts his own observations (quantitative and qualitative). He has calipers of his own. Physician's scales that he mentioned using can be found at any half-decent gym. 

I used to do quick calculations in my mind of how many grams of protein I was getting when I got more serious about lifting and building muscle. It took very little effort to look to the back at the nutrition labels, or (for produce, meat, etc, stuff without labels) check online. I could, to this day remember details about what % fat milk has the highest amount of protein per serving (1%). Best protein to calorie ratio is non-fat milk, obviously. And the cheapest meat source of protein is tuna (avg 40g per typical can). 

It sounds crazy to most people who weren't athletes or physically competitive.

The only part of this that raised an eyebrow was his mention of DEXA. For reference: You can be expected to pay about 200-250 USD these days. He'd be paying 800-1000 USD annually if it's a quarterly thing.

Therapy, on the other hand, is expensive. The only way I could afford it was through my father's insurance. Other people do so through my school's provided insurance, which was good. (Some people managed to avoid that.) It's also time consuming in more ways than one. I was mentally paralyzed for a semester from either geodon or wellbutrin.

Also, his problem with getting this funded is asking his parents for the money and explaining the situation to them. I can see how asking for funding for DEXA would be easier. My own parents paid for my set of weights when I was in HS as they respected that I was putting effort into my physical self. I wasn't nearly as ready to discuss issues that might disappoint them.

&gt; He also grew from 5'1 to 6'1 and packed on 80 lbs of muscle in 2 years, which even with the 15-17 year old puberty spike, is kinda ridiculous. Not buying it

On average,

peak height velocity occurs in boys at the age of 14, at a rate of 10.3 cm per year. That's over *4 inches per year*. That's average. Growing a foot is within the realm of possibility from age 15-17.

Peak weight velocity occurs at the same time, at a rate of about 9 kg per year. That's almost 20 lbs per year. This can easily be amplified by weight lifting. I added 50 lbs to my body weight in my last two years of high school (that's AFTER my peak height velocity which should usually coincide with peak weight), and I didn't even know what the fuck I was doing. One bicep was noticeably larger than the other, because I casually curled with it while watching tv too often and stupidly thought it would help me win at arm wrestling vs other guys. I didn't take protein supplements... didn't even know how much I needed for how much I was working out.

Again, the numbers I showed were averages, including kids who didn't put any effort into their growth. I can easily see someone putting on 80 lbs during puberty (not just of muscle) if he was actually that aware at that age. I had friends in HS who were athletes who had gone through that.

topdnbass,leagueoflegends,1389358265.0,"The plan for kassadin was to take away power from his Q and E and put it into his W.  

That way he will have to autoattack to get his damage off, making him easier to kite.  

The problem with kass isn't his damage though. There are assassins with a lot of mobility but more upfront damage (e.g. fizz, zed, khazix, akali).  

The main thing that makes kass powerful is his ultimate.  
He can use it to disengage and engage/chase, and it has a short cooldown.  
Kassadin doesn't have amazing single target damage (compared to others). This is made up for by the fact that he doesn't need resets to clean up fights.  
That nerf will make his weaknesses show. He will need to auto people, making it really unlikely that he will quickly 1 shot people.  

If that happens id see kass become strong as a bruiser. E.g. iceborn/sunfire. That way he will actually have a chance at getting off more than a few autos before being destroyed in a teamfight. Also being alive longer means more rifts.

ibbity,AskWomen,1389358598.0,"Short answer: No. 

Long answer: No, and I think you're projecting to a GIANT extent your insecurities onto other people. Women who like to be dominant in bed, prefer submissive men in bed. It's a sexual preference just like any other. Dominant man/submissive woman may be the culturally agreed-upon ""norm"" but that doesn't mean that any deviation is bad or wrong or shameful. Also, BDSM porn =/= women considering submissive men trash irl. It's the acting out of a sexual fantasy that is held by BOTH partners. They both get off on the activities, and both respect the other's preferences and boundaries. 

I am guessing that you are not from an English-speaking culture, which may have something to do with your extreme feelings here; I know that there are cultures out there which put an extreme emphasis on men being ""manly,"" i.e. rough and dominant and controlling of ""his"" woman. It might be tougher in such a culture to have such preferences without feeling bad about them, because everyone seems to be telling you that it's weird, but it really isn't. "

More to the point, though, is that it isn't chemical. It isn't even very scientific, if you regard science as being lab work and settled empirical facts. The empirical facts computer science has come directly from its mathematical underpinnings; once you move beyond the mathematics, you're in the realm of either sociology or pure opinion very quickly.

you don't have to be a bitch about it

&gt;Supply for those goods could also increase

Do you understand in practice what increase supply means? logistical costs, storage costs, fuel costs, handling costs? 

&gt;That would require zero increase in supply of anything, which is ridiculous

Are you autistic or you just don't understand the difference between a model and real life? at any given there is a constraint on supply, anywhere from production, to transport to storage.

&gt;Nobody is even talking about increasing the money supply.

Lets say on average people spend 400 bucks on food, the industry that serves them gets from 1000 people 400 000 dollars, 

If people are given 500 dollars they won't stick to their previous budget, the most conservative will spent the same amount because that is the minimum level at witch their needs are met, however most will spend more, because they have new income, so in their new budget they allocate more for food, so the new average will certainly be more than 400 dollars/ person dedicated to that industry. This means that from those 1000 people the industry will make, without any increase in prices, more than 400 000. That is a increase in money supply."

(That's why they want me to try my stomach, but that feels like a more sensitive part of my body, so I'm hesitant to try it.)

However, if you *do* decide to try your legs, try a few different locations before you decide if it's better or worse than your stomach.  I received my first loading dose in my GI's office - the nurse did 2, then I did 2.  She gave me the first one lower on my thigh, about four inches above my knee, and my reaction was just, ""OMG that hurts more than I thought it would!""  Then she did the second one much higher on my thigh, and it hurt so badly that I (embarrassingly) had an instantaneous vasovagal response, and almost passed out (my blood pressure plummeted to 90/53!). After everyone stopped panicking, she said, ""well, at least now you know to never give yourself a shot *there.*"" I did the next two myself, closer to my knee on my other leg, with absolutely no problem.

Since sneak attack damage doesn't multiply on a crit, this allows me to pass my critical hits onto other party members with bigger, badder weapons. And, since the Wakizashi has such a large threat range, I end up getting the chance to use it a lot. It's not as good against rabble, but when you're facing a single hard target, you can kill it pretty quickly by passing a crit to the power-attacking, earthbreaker-wielding fighter.

Vanishing Trick and Invisible Blade are both amazing and make it a lot easier to use sneak attacks. Especially if you're two-weapon fighting.

Other than that, I've got a lot of mileage out of developing my role as skill monkey and taking the tricks that best suit that role, like Fast Stealth and Undetected Sabotage. Wall Climber's on the list for later.

clairebones,TwoXChromosomes,1389359640.0,"I agree with most of the comments here, and Supernanny is definitely a good option to watch. My mum is a childminder with a handful of kids in the house every day, so she had to deal with a big range of types of misbehaviour from different kids, and it can be tough because some parents really don't discipline their kids beyond 'Now please don't do that'. The 2 most effective 'punishments' we found were: 

**1. Time out:** We have a 'naughty bench' in the hallway, you can't see a TV or any toys there and nobody else is allowed to play with a kid who is on the naughty bench. They will test it at first by trying to get up before their time. But you put them back *silently*, thereby not giving them the attention they want. Make it clear that the bench is a bad place to be, that it is for children who are misbehaving, so they know they;ve done wrong. 

**2. Taking stuff away:** Obviously when they're only at your house part if the day this was harder, but the main idea is that depending on what they were doing you take something of them. One of the kids used to love picking up any toy and then teasing all the younger kids that he had it, just to make them want it and then not give it to him. So every time, we took it straight off him once he started teasing. Eventually he learned he couldn't get away with it.

These patterns should be in place long before your kid(s) go to even nursery school, so they should be raised well enough that they aren't the type to misbehave so badly in school. 

One thing I would definitely recommend, especially if you have an only child or one whose siblings are much younger, is that you **make sure they are socialising with children their age** as soon as possible. This will teach them to respect and understand other children, and teach them how to share, so they aren't new to the idea when starting school. In my experience children who get this experience behave much better in general."

&gt;He was attending a conference in Barcelona, and we spoke for over an hour about his company and its major pipeline drug that has recently received FDA approval. Much to my amazement, they've managed to synthesize a vaccine that has proven to be incredibly effective in treating certain types of cancer.

&gt;In the course of our discussion, he told me about several other companies in the same industry which were deeply undervalued by the market.

&gt;""The interesting thing about this industry,"" he said, ""is that all the science is already public information, published in the medical journals. Our stock prices don't move, though, for months until the IR department issues a press release. Smart investors have an interim window to scoop up the next breakthrough drug company for pennies.""

&gt;He cited a few examples, including one company that had over 9-months between its medical journal publication and press release. The stock barely budged during that time period, but within weeks of the press release it was a 10-bagger."

dangertime,AskMen,1389360012.0,"&gt;how many of you are unwilling to sacrifice a little sleep for sex with your SO?

I am. I cherish my sleep because it is very difficult for me to get there, I need a lot of it to feel normal, and I'm terrible allergic to mornings. My body does not feel anything but bad before I ingest my morning coffee and medications. 



If I'm deliberately woken up before my alarm for any reason that is not an emergency (and no, my SO feeling horny is NEVER an emergency) I am very unpleasant.




&gt;I can't really reconcile being rejected all the time

Maybe you should stop trying to initiate sex when he's trying to sleep. He's made it very clear that he does not enjoy being woken up for sex. Why can't you respect his feelings? How would you feel if he tried to initiate sex while you were talking on the phone with a friend or trying to do something for work/school? How would you feel if you clearly showed him that you didn't like that and he kept doing it? 





&gt;I am starting to think it's because he's becoming unattracted to me

Why can't it be because he doesn't feel aroused in the middle of the night or because he was woken up earlier than he intended?

clairebones,relationships,1389360081.0,"There are some red flag here that suggest to me that you should be looking for other options rather than moving in with him, at the very least. 

He does not seem concerned by your feelings, hence his behaviour flirting with your friend and his refusal to talk when you are irritated or upset, as well as his lack of effort in helping you work with your gender identity changes.

I also get the impression that he is using the drinking etc because he knows it will get you to stay with him, and he doesn't like the idea of being single even though he seems to be bored as you say. 

I don't think this guy will ever change unless you break up with him and he hits rock bottom unfortunately. Do not let him run your time and make you miserable just because he doesn't want to put the effort in. He is 26, if he is daft enough to drink himself into a stupor then that is his own fault and nobody else can change this (I have a few alcoholics in my family, I know this pattern)."

Or don't make a group, I want a group, someone else doesn't want a group.. I can join a group and get member markers and HUD and whatnot, and other people don't.. everyone wins.

I get yelled at (on reddit, so sad) about this basically whenever i post it, but that won't stop me. Its as if my suggesting it ruins everyone elses game even though it could (and should) be entirely optional.. Everyone wins but people still hate the very idea. Not sure why, besides the 'if you don't play it my way you're playing it wrong and you're a stupid head' sort of attitude.

Character customization would help, like facial hair and things like that, and just different colours of clothing too, but it will always be difficult.

Peddlers make Swindler a losing strategy, but such an action-chain-dependent approach is easy pickings for a mountebank or two to gum up the works.

The alternative is a **Duke strategy** - it views the extra copper given out by mountebank as a bonus! Having one horse traders in hand all but guarantees 5 for a duke/duchy, Farming village will help bypass greens, as would any swindling of dukes/duchies into hunting parties (though that's obviously something you want to avoid happening too much). 

Both of these strategies depend on the other player being slow off the mark in picking up colonies. It doesn't take many of those to make the peddler-forge-province game unwinnable. Playing against a duke player with colony buys is a risky business, but **Hunting Party** is a huge boon in such a strategy. Get a single Platinum, Gold, and Mountebank and you can use Hunting Party chains to nab a colony and give out a curse and a copper most turns without ever bothering to trash at all. Alternatively swap out the mountebank for a horse traders, which will bootstrap you up a bit faster but doesn't slow down the enemy at all."

If they keep half the savings (ie, from credits cards being processed at a lower rate) from this, that's roughly $100k USD in BTC savings (assuming 2% savings over credit card), or 117.6 coins at the current price.  For a company doing $1B in revenue, keeping 110 BTC per year seams like a reasonable strategy."

The issue is the production of child porn itself. I don't see anything wrong with watching under age hentai or reading erotica, but watching real porn featuring a child feeds a market that is harmful and destructive to not just the lives of the children, but the families that sell them into the porn industry or lose their children to porn.

the issue with child porn is not who watches it. hell, most of us have watched child porn by accident if you've ever been to 4chan. The real issue is the fact that it is made, and the more people who whatch it, the more money there is in making it, and the more people do it."

Serae,TheGirlSurvivalGuide,1389361707.0,"My skin is pretty sensitive and I used to shave more.  If I shaved every 3-4 days my skin eventually got used to it.  But there was a great deal of prep for me.  First I exfoliated with a dry brush on the mons.  Then I rubbed the hair with baby oil and let it sit for abit.

When I got into the shower I used a Proraso shaving creme which I just thing is the best for all my shaving needs.  I changed my blades often, rinsed often and sometimes I reapplyed shaving cream.  It took me a little while to build up to going against the grain but started with the grain.

When I got out of the shower I did an alcohol swab on the external area to avoid any follicle infection.  Then I rubbed an alum stone on it.  I found I needed to moisturize my bits (once a day) with some sort of lotion to help prevent itch.

For me, though, after years of doing it I was itchy the next day.  Really itchy.  Using up entire tubes of anti-itch creme a week itchy.  I tend shaved only for special occasions until my husband said, ""It makes you too uncomfortable, you don't have to do it if it bothers you.""  I'd mostly been doing it for him so I went back to trimming and never encountered the itch monster again.

If you love the look and feel, try different methods and products.  Be diligent until you find something that works for you!  For me, it was a particular hassle and I eventually learned to love a little neat fuzz.  My life got much easier.

So, Ash didn't recognize Mewtwo as a *species*, let alone a person, because he doesn't recollect meeting Mewtwo because Mewtwo wiped his memory. To add onto this, Mewtwo from the Genesect film doesn't recognize Ashe because the two have never met before - this is a completely new Mewtwo."

But I kickbox and do jiu-jitsu 4-10 hours a week (depends on the week), and have an active job, so the calculation has to be wrong. I've never had a water displacement test done, but I'd be really interested in seeing the results.

Vegemeister,AskMen,1389362150.0,"You see, I go completely the opposite way.  In my opinion, if you *actually believe* that a fetus is a person and an inviolable right to life exists -- that a human fetus is equally as valuable as an adult human -- then protesting with emotionally manipulative 3D sonograms and pictures of aborted fetuses and harassing doctors who perform abortions at their homes and businesses are logically consistent and correct strategies. Of course, you would also be morally obligated to advocate for widely accessible birth control.

The pro choice side focuses far to much on bodily integrity and weaselly deontological arguments.  The important facts are that fetuses aren't people and that being an unplanned and/or unwanted child sucks."

Never been a big fan of the emulsion step, as my skin is really oily, but my routine runs like this:

Morning: cleanse, toner, serum, bp, cream, bb cream

Night: oil cleanse, cleanse, toner, sheet mask once a week (if I remember), serum (skip this if I use mask), bp, and cream

I've been looking into eye creams but don't know where to begin! I'm starting to notice slight wrinkles &gt;.&lt;

NuttyFanboy,doctorwho,1389362411.0,"The problem as I see it has many facets:

- the radical change of style from Series 5 onwards. New showrunner, new Doctor, and a different way of storytelling came together in one storm. I suspect that was a bit much to take for people who started with Ecclestone or Tennant.  

- Matt Smith, or rather his portrayal of the Doctor. Personally, he resonated the most with me of all Doctors - insofar that he repeatedly did stuff where I thought ""damn, I could've come up with that/done that"". Among my friends, I call Eleven the 'Aspie Doctor'. A number of friends never really warmed up to Eleven (whereas I really took to him) - they say he's too successful for being that geeky and awkward and can't seem to reconcile these aspects of his personality.  
- Moffats penchant for long arcs, obscure details and a tendency to leave it to the viewer to read between the lines in many cases. A whole lot of people want all tied up in a neat, tidy package, everything explained and not be left hanging at the end of a story.  
He throws in a lot of references and pieces into episodes that might lead somewhere, and picks up on some and ignores/discards others. I feel like that rubs some people the wrong way, and it is something I can understand - it sort of creates a rather rushed feel in storytelling, especially coupled with the fact that there are only 13 episodes a series (plus 1-2 specials).

Combine these three points and the fact that Moffat is the current showrunner, and he's the automatic lightning rod for any fan who feels he was wronged. A whole lot of people are lazy, and as such a central,  convenient target of ire is preferable to a differentiated treatment of issues."

Take from it what you will, but i'm referring to this bit here;

“The idea with DayZ was to put the players in a situation. And this is something I delved a lot into when I was working with the army. So if we take the example of, if you broke your leg in DayZ, and you have to use morphine before you can walk--now that’s absurd, that’s not realistic at all. Unless you’re like, I don’t know, Chuck Norris or something. And then the morphine needle would break on his leg. So it’s not realistic in that sense. But because the act of getting your leg broken causes a change in the situation that’s quite dramatic, it has a sense of authenticity to the people involved.""

So, the point he is trying to make - that i understand anyway - is that it isn't about realism, all these people saying 'you can't have a map in game because its not realistic' or people not liking HUDs, or groups, or the things like being knocked out by fists and whatnot. Its not about being *realistic*, its about being authentic to the experience, and you can do that AND have quality of life things, like a group mechanic, and friend'y spotting HUD elements and so on."

Xpress_interest,AskReddit,1389363059.0,"This guy's dick-sucking math checks out *only if* there is always another dick to be sucked at the ready. Other factors such as attractiveness, dick-sucking ability and renown would ultimately affect the dick-sucker's earning potential as well. So there are a tremendous number of variables at play. I assume the 2.5 million was an attempt to take these factors into account, however the major factor not taken into account is dick-sucking years (DSYs) - the *typical* dick-sucker would likely have only 15 or so solid DSYs (~18-33) to begin with before business would start to suffer.  


This would limit earnings drastically; regardless of raw skill aquired after 15 years of blowing guys as your living, many potential clients will seek greener pastures in which to plant their seed. The declining years of a dick-sucker's career (~34-55) will see a slow petering out of clientele. Although a quility dick sucker will have a base of rock-solid loyal customers, these customers will age as well, and even the most eager 20 year old will require any fewer dick suckings as the years drag on."

So I side with Pascal's wager. There are benefits to believing and disadvantages to not believing if God's real. But if he is not real then your belief creates no disadvantage.... Except for having people hate you on Reddit

Edit: wow people don't like my opinion... Didn't expect this

Edit 2: I'm not saying that I have taken to believing 100% in Pascal's Wager. I came upon this belief on my own, and someone on here brought out that it's close to Pascal's Wager once so I use that to explain it now. 

Edit 3: You guys are arguing my belief in God. This was an answer to why I'm religious. There is a difference. Why I believe in God is completely different.

Edit 4: I can't keep up with all of your replies, and I didn't make this to argue with both atheists and theists. The reason I believe doesn't have anything to do with the fact that God hasn't been disproven. It seems that a lot of you are trying to put words into my mouth, or assuming I believe one way or another. So here it is:

Long story short, when I look at the universe I see order. I don't think that we're bouncing signals off of satellites arguing about religion out of complete randomness. I believe that there is a God that set everything into motion with an algorithm, and everything is supposed to evolve and improve throughout time. 

I believe he's passive in his actions within our universe, and doesn't hate anyone for what they believe, but appreciates those who put effort into appreciating what he's given us. I don't think he's going to destroy you or anyone for their beliefs. I use ""he"" liberally because it's just easier to say... I doubt God has any gender because he's obviously not part of our universe. God created man in his image because we're critical thinkers and have free will. 

I don't believe in anything that has been created by religions as scare tactics to stay with that religion. If you guys want to ask me things feel free to do it, but why don't we discuss instead of accuse each other?"

This argument seems logical, however, the smaller companies owner is a middle class local who uses his festivals to support local charities, lives in the local community, and has gone so far as to mortgage his house to get his events going. Michael Moore, doesn't just crispier capitalism and then exploit it by default he actively deceives he still gets paid, but it's done as a not for profit venture. Many people even here see him as a hero who brought great stuff to Traverse City, but this town is a tourist Mecca with or without his help even before his festivals the city was doing well. Now he could've done all of his ""great work"" in his ""hometown"" of flint a town that needs a boost, but it wouldn't have made  him as much money.

For me it's large red flag when fresh, upcoming, MMO has;

* Large initial price tag

* Monthly fee

* In-game store for microtransactions at day 0

   * No matter what they sell there initially

Maybe I'm too *old school* when I think that you take max 2 of those, but never all of them. I know that Blizz is putting store into WoW client, but same time they have been very vocal about how they wont wave monthly fees anytime soon. I'm not thrilled about that either.

Songs are going to sound differently on different monitors. Some monitors, like the Rokits, are known to produce more lower end than Yamahas.

If you think Yamahas are terrible speakers, then by all means grab those Rokits. 

&gt; i know they are supposed to sound accurate, but why not good and accurate?

That is not really a fair question to ask, my friend. What you think sounds good, may be someone else's horrible. I am a huge fan of Yamahas, and I think they sound fantastic. You, on the other hand do not like them and that is totally okay.

If i were you, i would give a chance to a few other brands before making a devision. Try out some Mackies or M Audio and see if you still prefer Rokits. If you are convinced that Rokits sound the best, get them!"

The main problem here wasn't the orignal statement that you posted (in my opinion, that statement was innocuous and the mods seemingly overreacted); the real problem is your immature method of conflict resolution.

Oh, and on an unrelated note, I find it quite disturbing that you would casually discuss your desire to ""reduce"" the American white population by 85%. There's a name for that kind of thing; if I recall, according to international human rights agencies, it is known as *genocide.* I genuinely hope that you were being facetious, because advocating for ""forced population reduction"" is pretty revolting. I would never contenance mass-murder, and I have never met anyone who would support a morally bankrupt endeavor like the one that you describe so nonchalantly.

PanGalacGargleBlastr,DeadBedrooms,1389363374.0,"Advice:

1. the World has changed.  Divorce doesn't carry the stigma it once did.  Sex is good, and kinky sex is better.  

3. Honesty and communication are important.

2. As a woman, on-line dating is stilted in your favor, as long as you don't mind wading through lots of short and/or crude messages.

3.  Go see a therapist.  As much as your husband may have issues, your coping with them will leave you with some emotional baggage.  This will help you get a handle on it.

4.  Take your time.  Looking for love or a marriage immediately will only make you frustrated.  Look to meet people, have a good time.  Date around, and don't settle down quickly.  

5.  OKCupid seems to work well if you're in a populated area.  

6.  Find a free clinic, get yourself tested.  Then do that every 3-6 months until you find 'the one' - condoms break, people lie, test results don't."

Bearmodule,GraphicDesign,1389363512.0,"Few things:

- With a processor it's not just the clock speed to think about, there's a lot more to it than that
- A good graphics card I'd recommend for designers would be something like an nvidia quadro, they're excellent from what I hear though I've not had the fortune to try one
- Should note that the FLOPS count is the number of calculations per second while Hz is just the number of cycles per second the processor can perform. Actual processor speed is cycles * flops.

What that means is a processor with a lower clock speed could be a better performer than one with a higher clock speed. Example numbers: 

980 MHz with 2.2 TFLOPS would be better than a processing unit that had a clock speed of 1.2 GHz and 1.7 TFLOPS.

A good graphics card can be helpful if you're doing any sort of 3d rendering or video rendering, an nvidia quadro gpu is the thing you'll want. When it comes to hard drives, a HDD will last longer but will be slower to access the data (since it's all mechanical), an SSD will not last as long and will be much more expensive per GB but it will be faster at loading your data, this includes loading software and booting up.

NomadicScribe,Cyberpunk,1389363610.0,"As has been said elsewhere, ""Cyberpunk"" is ""high tech, low life"". Futuristic/advanced technology applied to gritty street level scenarios, ethically questionable practices, and crime. This is in contrast to the sanitized image of SF which has been the standard for some decades (reaching for an ideal future, focus on space travel, Star Trek, etc). So more than just design, Cyberpunk is defined by setting, character, and application.

""Steampunk"" is more about anachronistic technology. The ""-punk"" suffix, as happens with so many publishing labels, was applied only because of literary association with Cyberpunk. The original question there was, ""what if Babbage had successfully completed and deployed his Difference Engine?"" Somehow this has become more about weird westerns and fantasy set in Victorian England, but the original thought experiment and alternate history focus remains valid.

My point with trying to delineate Steampunk is that I don't believe that Cyberpunk should be defined by Steampunk. They are not twin genres, and the ""-punk"" suffix has a different application for each genre."

The most notable ex wanted to join the club her friend danced at to get more money for school and life expenses. The club let her practice with her friend over the course of a couple days (during slow hours for the club, think mid day). But, strip clubs that don't market themselves as ""high end"" clubs will let anyone they deem attractive on stage.

They aren't even concerned about dancers knowing how to use the pole. The dancer's main purpose is to keep people there buying booze and to act sexual on and off stage to promote more tips for the girls (clubs usually take a cut). 

Some of the high end clubs will want to see you perform. That usually comes from dancing at other clubs or going to a studio that teaches you. They've become popular for dancers and people who don't strip because pole dancing can be fun as hell."

**EDIT 1:**  A few notes...

1)  How would you roll down windows?  **NOTE FROM OP:**  While driving unarmed, press the fire button to roll up and down the window.  I assume OP means that giving the finger is disabled with bulletproof windows, but I'm sure we can live with that.

6)  I want this so badly.  ATVs, dirt bikes, and hell... even RVs!

7)  This would be beyond fun.

13)  There is never enough.  I could deal with having a couple 20-car garages.

18)  ~~There is a Taser in the game already.  They call it a ""Stun Gun"", though.~~  I failed to notice it's not available online.

31)  ~~I believe the Advanced Scope on the sniper rifles have this capability.~~  I think the thermal capability is actually for just a couple of missions.

By the time I quit the ski team I'd been through 8 knee/shoulder dislocations, two breaks and who knows how many concussions, she still stands by her decision :) Looking back now I'm convinced I would have had a lot more fun (and gotten a lot more pussy) playing TE or QB than freezing my ass off on some mountain four times a week for night training. 

I started following Utah Ute football at the beginning of the Urban Meyer/Alex Smith years (2003ish) due to college football being so big in Hawaii (moved there for college.) That was a lot of fun but I only got in to pro football in 2008 when my unit deployed to Iraq and I was forced in to the platoon fantasy football league. Been a fan of whatever team Alex Smith is on since, though KC is really growing on me and I'll probably settle down as a Chiefs fan.

The closest thing to legal discrimination is the way men are treated vs women in the justice system, however it isn't in the books it stems from societies perception of both sexes, these perceptions hurt both sexes in one way or another however it is men who generally get the short end of the stick in the justice system and family court.

After I broke it, I traced the people who made it to some mall or other. Also, in the mall, there was a rift in space which w...hen I came in contact with gave me the ability to absorb people. It turned out that a huge global war was starting, and the people in the mall were randomly trying to kill random people for no reason, so I absorbed a huge amount of random people. Then afterward, it turned out that the reason a dimensional rift was there was because God randomly opened it to get to our plane, so that he could give me a message. He told me that Jesus had randomly turned evil, and came to earth, and he was the one who was causing all the suffering on earth, and that I had to find him and kill him.

So we randomly started looking for clues as to where to find Jesus, all while a huge war was happening. Then, I decided we should read random holy scripture, to see whether it would tell us. I read some things, but couldn't find any clues, so I asked James Shine whether he had a copy of the dead... sea scrolls, but he said that Thomas Noonan had the last copy in existence, but had died, and lost it, and the only way to find out what it said was by ressurecting him. Then I said that we couldn't do that, because you weren't allowed to use necromancy to bring back people from heaven, but James told me not to worry, because Thomas Noonan actually went to hell for having sex with Tom Quinlan.

So I ressurected him into a zombie that had glowing red eyes And asked him what the dead sea scrolls said. Also, he told me that James gave me bad information, and that he actually had a threesome between him, tom quinlan and Ashley Shares .Well, after comparing notes, we decided that Jesus was ...the source of God's goodness, so, if they split in two, and were against eachother, we should be on Jesus' side. Also, right then, Jesus had come to see why people were using necromancy, and to stop it, but then he realized who we were, and started running away. We chased him through the bulding, but when we got outside, he stole a motorcycle, and me, james and Zombie Noonan were chasing him in a car which illogically had the ability to make huge leaps through the air. After we caught him, we explained that we were really on his side.

Then, he explained that he didn't cause the problems on earth, that people themselves caused them, and God had decided that people sucked too much, and gave up trying to fix them, and was just going to erase everything. And since Jesus didn't want to do that, he wanted to destroy him, too.So then we made a plan, ...and I absorbed Jesus, but because of all the other evil people I had absorbed, the evil and good cancelled eachother out, and I got sealed away in a big seal that generated on the ground. Then I told James and Tom Noonan, who also illogically transformed into benjamin linus and the little prince that The power of Jesus cancelled out God's power, but it was possible for regular people to break the seal, because it was just a seal on the ground, and that they had to spend the entire length of the rest of the world protecting it.

And inside the seal, Inside my own body, my soul would have to spend that time fighting against all the other people I had absorbed, who had turned into spiritual demi-gods, because I had also absorbed Jesus. and I'd only be able to use the full power of Jesus after they were all dead. This woul...d of course, take all the time of thbe rest of the life of the world, but after the world was erased, the fully powered Me/Jesus hybrid, which would be the last thing in existence would have to battle against God. Of course if we won, we could remake the world and fix everything, but that would be hard to explain to the people trying to break the seal. I never got to see how it ended, though. The last scene was me explaining what was going to happen. "

bunker_man,AskReddit,1389364292.0,"Another dream. Even older. Several years ago types up.

I just had this crazy dream. I don't remember much about the beginning. Long story short, everyone lived in a crapsack world, and a few people were trying to escape from the surface by moving into a Bioshock style underwater place, but their submarine crashed, so they had to make the last part of the journey in scuba suits. When they got there, the place was all but abandoned, but they had no way to leave, so they stayed there with the few people who lived there, not really even sure whether their life was more terrible than what they left on the surface.

Then, after a short period where I woke up, I had another dream, which I'm pretty sure wasn't even supposed to be related at first. This random uber-genius rang someone's doorbell, and climbed in their window while they were not opening the door? I'm not sure how this part was relevant, but him and someone else set on a journey in a different submarine that I don't even remember what the journey was about. However, they found the underwater city by accident, and rescued the two people who by this point were the only people there who were still alive.

Then, the four of them set upon a random journey through a craphole Chrono-trigger type future world, except that it was humans fighting other humans instead of robots. They were trying to stop the war by attempting to assassinate the leader of the attacking army, but they had no idea where he was, because there seemed to be no central command. They eventually found a way to visibillize (to them, not everyone else) a random invisible ship called Noah's Ark, which they had come to the conclusion was the enemy command ship. The ship they climbed onto looked kind of like an overly large sentinel from the matrix. But with blue  eyes instead of red.

However, when they climbed onto it, they found random texts from the literal Biblical Noah, who says that he had eventually come upon the knowledge that Adam had not been the first human, but simply another like him. Every time the world got to a point where it was beyond saving, the everlasting ark would choose a few humans to start the world over, and then remake the world, with those few humans safe inside it. And this had been going on for ages so long that it was not even possible to have records of all of them. So, every few times it did this, it would erase the memory of the people it chose, and they would live, thinking they were the first humans.

Of course, the people eventually realize that the Ark had been Valis-style leading them to end up boarding it, and that it was about to destroy the world. So they tried to find a way to dismantle the ship, to save it. After they realized that the ship was literally undamagable, and had a short philosophical discussion with the ship's on-board computer about how this was necessary, and how that no matter what happened, humanity would eventually become beyond saving, as it had in the past; they realized that there was nothing they could do to stop it, and sat there crying, and looking helpless while the ship unmade the world beneath them.

So, I just had this dream where Brendan Hodges, his mom, my brother Matt (for some reason) and a mysterious stranger who looked like he was in a fire were all in an old-style car together going on vacation, or something. They stopped at a hotel, but when they went in, the people in charge were acting like total dicks to them. (Also talking about how Germany was screwed, because without Hitler's awesome CO power, they couldn't survive against their enemies) The mysterious strnger said to get the hell out of there, but the guy at the door, who was the only nice person kep telling them they SHOULD get out, so Matt decided that that meant that they should stay. All this time, the burned stranger (who had amnesia, apparently) was having mysterious visions of the hotel blowing up, and of therebeing chinese food in the hotel's refrigerator. Eventually, the people oni charge of the hotel decided that they were going to kill everyone who went there, and I think they may have killed some of them, but then the mysterious stranger started fighting back, and decided to cap[ture all of them, so that noone else would get killed. After kicking the shit out of everyone from the hotel (except the door-guy who wasn't a jackass) he was going to run out, because he thought his visions were of the hotel blowing up right then. Noone wanted him to go back in, because they thought he could see the future, and that that would m,ean he would be killed, but he wantedd to rescue the door guy, who was trapped inside for some reason. he went in and told him to leave, but the door guy said that he didn't want to. The guy opened the fridge, to try to verify his dream, and prove that the hotel was about to blow up. But in the place where the chinese food was supposed to be, there was some macaroni and cheese. The other guy eventually decided to leave, and that the hotel would blow up. He thanked the mysterious stranger for helping him, but then told the stranger that he knew who he was and that he had to kill him for the good of humanity. The stranger got shot, but then he realized that his vision wasn't of the present, but of one week in the future. He realized that he was Hitler, and that if he went back, and got back in power that America would have started dropping atomic bombs on Germany, and that millions of people would be killed even if he won the war. Of course, since he was dying, that meant that this wasn't going to happen. So... Hitler died with a smile on his face, because he had inadvertently stopped the disaster by getting amnesia, and by doing something that he only did because he finally learned the true value of kindness.

Juice contains vitamins.  Fresh squeezed and unfiltered juice -- or juice with pulp -- also contains fiber, but not as much as consuming the fruit or vegetable by itself.  Some people would benefit from consuming more vitamins.  Many would benefit from consuming more fiber.  But some will not.  And some people who will benefit from these will drink them if they have the option but will not eat them -- thus why it's really complicated, and why juicing has been pushed by some people."

Luckily, my parents allowed me and my siblings grow up to decide what we want to believe, rather than ""shove it down our throats,"" or look down upon us if we had other beliefs. 

First of all, I do not associate myself with any form of organized religion because of how twisted many of them seem to be. I honestly view churches as massive money schemes. Having missionaries show up at my door to preach the word or God is no different in my mind than a person showing up at my door to sell vacuums. 

As far as GOD is concerned, I have no idea (and probably never will) how or why I am even here to question my own existence. Because the ""existence"" of God is strictly based on ""faith"", and not proven facts, hypothesis, or theories, I choose not to believe in him either.

That's half the reason I play MMOs right there.

The game is such garbage, that I could play it for free in the beta this weekend, and I'm not going to. If I want to play an Elder Scrolls game, I'd play Skyrim which is better (and supports modding which is awesome). If I want to play an MMO, I'd play Final Fantasy XIV or WoW (which are both subscription MMOs). I'm sure as hell not spending 60 bucks on this, and an additional 15/month.

Note: my opinions are based on the early game content. I haven't played the end-game so I do not know if it's any good. But if the early stuff is crap, I doubt the end-game would be any better. And I gave this game the benefit of the doubt, too.

&gt; Those people should be removed then. American hypocrisy and failure to punish her war criminals do not negate Japan's responsibility. Why are you using America as an example? America didn't start WWII. Why not use Germany? There is no German war memorial that contain Nazi remains. I think you should ask yourself that question. Why use America as the benchmark?

Because of victors justice. Just because the Allies won the war doesn't excuse them from war crimes. If you want a German example instead of a Japanese one, notice that Germany was *not* charged with the waging of unrestricted submarine warfare. This is because when the issue was brought up at Nuremburg it was discovered that the Allies had been conducting the same type of warfare in the Pacific theatre. So they couldn't charge the Germans with it without being on trial for it themselves. Also, consider that you are comparing a political group that lasted for a couple decades compared to an imperial monarchy that had existed for 2000 years. Rites are totally different in Japan than they are in the Western world. As someone who sounds educated on Japan, why you aren't taking this into account seems rather strange. On another note, the only comparison that I am bringing up to US national Cemeteries (There are way more than just Arlington) is that they are where the military dead are honored. Same with Yasukuni, just with a different type of rite surrounding it. When a leader, be it Obama or Abe, go to these shrines, it's to pay respects to the dead who gave their service to their country. Abe is not sitting there, singling out the war criminals and thanking them. Neither is Obama. 

&gt; why use America as a comparison to Japan?

You're failing to see the whole ""Rules are different for the winners"" point I'm trying to bring up. It's a double standard and it's wrong.

&gt; Just go to Yushukan, the museum inside Yasukuni. I went there. Even my native Japanese friend refused to go inside. Use google. I won't try to even explain.

So you have personal experience but you won't use your wealth of knowledge from actually being there to explain it to me, and instead suggest Google?

&gt; Benefit all of Asia? They wanted to replace Western colonization with Japanese imperialism. Of course it made sense to them. Doesn't make it right.

And this is where I stop arguing with you. You are twisting what I'm saying to somehow suggest that I'm ok with it. A little piece of information for you: just because someone understands why someone did something doesn't mean they agree with it. Of course I know it doesn't make it right, but it was the view they had at the time and fits with the narrative that they were trying to push on the public. Was what they were doing a benefit to Japan? Yes. Was it a benefit to the whole of Asia? Absolutely not, and there are tons of accounts from various colonies that prove it.

I've argued with you on Japan and the war before, and was reluctant to even respond to you at first because I recall having this exact same problem with you. I'm not a Japanese revisionist and I'm not sympathetic that Japan were victims, but that doesn't mean I can't be objective when looking at everything that happened.

Good day to you."

It stands to reason that someone who has been with say 30+ people is not as likely to treat you as a realistic long term partner as someone who was a small handful. You can make the argument that there may be a time when it is still too forward to ask this, but it will certainly come up eventually, and the only people it wouldn't matter to at at the very least an informational standpoint are people who don't care to try to determine what their actual situation is. This is the opposite of growing up. Whatever you're going for, it helps to understand and correctly identify / interact with the real situation in front of you. And this is literally one of the most important information pieces in order to do so with. There are others of course. But either way."

&gt; Boys attain a peak height velocity of 10.3 cm/year, on average, 2 years later than girls, during Tanner genital stage 4, and gain **28 cm in height** [16]. 

That is close to a foot.

These are average numbers. Some may take longer, some take shorter. Some get their growth spurts later. Look at that peak height velocity. That is slightly over 4 inches a year.  Supposedly, it took this OP 3 years to grow a foot, meaning he either went higher than average, or maintained average peak for a longer period of time than most boys.

Not exactly improbable.

I'm not sure why this of all things is what's questionable about that OP's post. If he's lying, then he's done his research and kept his bragging within reason at least.

EDIT: Reading through that OP's history, he doesn't even say that he gained it all in 3 years.

IngwazK,starbound,1389365307.0,"Your first planet, scoure the surface at first and mine every ore you see.  Smelt them and use them to make weapons and armor.  Hopefully you at least have enough for some copper armor.  After that, you can move to a new planet if you want or stick with your current one.  Now you will probably want to repeat the first step if on a new planet, or start digging downward if on the same one.  Digging down can give you access to fairly large clusters of rarer ores.  You wont get a ton of the rarer ones kn the first tier, but youll find plenty of what you need.  Keep upgrading your armor and weapons.  Once you have that tier's best armor and weapons, you can probably take on the boss without too much trouble (red stim packs are your best friend in dangerous combat).  

After that, you move one to a new sector and repeat.  

Wood can be smelted into coal at a rate of 10:1 (which really isnt a bad way to get some coal).

When in combat, currently the enemy is fairly basic.  DO NOT charge your enemy.  Let your enemy come to you.  If your weapon has good knockback, you can hit them first and rarely get hit yourself.  Otherwise, jumping and dodging are your best friends.  Learn to use them properly.  Single combat is the best idea early on.    

In the current stage of the game, weapon distribution is shit.  You wont find a gun drop until tier 4 and any weapons enemies drop are likely to be weaker than the basic tier ones you can make until later tiers.  Make a weapon and make sure its one you will like.

When it comes to humanoid enemies, beware.  Theyre far more dangerous, particularly if they have a gun.  Have a shield and one handed weapon for these situations.  You can hold your shild up by holding the mouse button that it is assigned to, and then releasing the button when you want to attack.

mine a literal buttload of plant fibres and use the crafting menu to make bandages.

The very beginning of the game is a bit harder, but once you have some gear and are a bit used to combat, you should do fine.  Watch out for aliens that are unusually large and have red pixels around them.  These are elite enemies and will attempt to rip  your skull and spinal cord out and use it as a musical instrument."

Dantilli,GetStudying,1389365330.0,"[I really like this idea for creating useful notes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNqSLPaZLc). I've used this basic idea my whole life without realising it and I've never had trouble understanding anything maths and physics related (I'm currently in my 2nd year of a degree in maths and phys).

After you think you have a reasonable understanding of a concept, do some questions. If ya get them wrong, study the concept again and rewrite your notes. Repeat as many times as is necessary. I usually go until I literally have no more questions, but I'd say stop as soon as you definitely understand it and all the questions start seeming the same.

I don't usually keep my answers unless it is a really interesting and complex question that I can actually learn something from. Mainly because if i'm not in the mood I'll often just look at the answer and not do the questions, which is completely pointless (but that's just me, you might find it hepful to keep em around).

Don't throw away questions when you've answered them either, especially if you don't keep the answer. I can guarantee that a month down the line you'll have completely forgotten most of them and can re-do them. Even if you haven't forgotten it's quite useful to review to keep the method fresh in your mind.

Finally, if you're in a class and it's WAY above your head and you don't understand anything, DON'T PANIC. Just take as many notes as possible, write down anything your tutor writes down, copy the slides (yes, even if you can look at them after, copy them now) write down anything he/she says that you think is useful. It helps to underline anything you think is core to the concept so you know what to focus on afterward. The take a few hours break and then have a look at your notes. If you take it nice and slow (I mean read a sentence and consider it for several seconds) you should be able to understand it MUCH easier than before."

He started his own construction company and became very successful and a multimillionaire. He also gave away some very nice and expensive thing to his best friend for his birthday. He built a 30,000 sq. ft. mansion especially for his friend.”

The three friends congratulated each other mutually for the successes of their sons. The fourth friend who earlier had gone to rest room returned and asked: “What's going on, what are all the congratulations for?” One of the three said: “We were talking about the pride we feel for the successes of our sons. What about your son?”

The fourth man replied: “My son is Gay and he makes a living dancing as a stripper at a nightclub.”

The three friends said: “What a shame that must be, that is horrible, what a disappointment you must feel.”

The fourth man replied: “No, I am not ashamed. Not at all. He is my son and I love him just as well, he is my pride and joy. In addition, he is very lucky too. Did you know that his birthday just passed and the other day he received a beautiful 30,000 sq. ft. mansion, a brand new jet, and a top of the line Mercedes Benz from his three boyfriends?”"

Where each / is you pressing the enter key.

1.  It's as easy as this.

3.  In numerical order.

If you want to make a list OUT of order, like picking a handful of numbers, you have to double-space and use parenthesis instead of periods after the numbers.

jerrysburner,AdviceAnimals,1389365756.0,"Which is mostly what I said above, but in a more civilized manner. Problem with people like you is you can't take off your political blinders - you see everything as a left/right-wing issue. You look to your political ""leaders"" and if they tell you something is left wing or right wing, you blindly follow.

Science shouldn't have these biases. Everything should be open to debate and research but because people don't want the (full) truth about many topics, we wall off certain areas to protect them from outside influence.

And the goal of politics in a free, democratic society shouldn't be to stake out sides. The truth is what should be important, but we've wildly warped our government from what it was originally established to be. It was never intended to be a life-career where you had to brainwash so many to convince them you should be re-elected.

EDIT: this just made it to the front page of reddit and is a great example - [death threats for academic who published story on athletes not being able to read](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/09/us/ncaa-athletes-unc-response/index.html?c=homepage-t).

r0thwell,Christianity,1389366038.0,"It's really all about trying to convince the people you want to rule over. Jesus was arguably one of the most important people in the Middle East during his time, when you tell hardly literate people you are the son of god and they can't prove you otherwise you have the potential to become quite powerful. The people he was trying to convince we're not very pro government, so he wasn't either. And when the bible was written a few decades after Jesus' death it was written more of a documentary of Jesus' life over the years excluding his teens and early twenties. After it had been translated dozens of times it became what it is today. A book about god and a basic guideline on how to live your life. The bible today is nothing like it was when it was originally written, no one knows what the original had said specifically but it was most likely just a list of the things Jesus did and the current version would be the ""Hollywood"" version."

You want sort of a ""little sister"" dynamic with them except you don't have to deal with their drama and they want to fuck you. If they try and suck you into their petty drama, you can let them vent but don't try and solve anything.

&gt;So, my question is, was that the correct way of handling the situation?

No. She knows it pissed you off but instead of owning it you lied. The lying makes you seem insecure, afraid of confrontation and weak in this case. That doesn't mean you should have flipped the fuck out. That would be the other extreme which also shows insecurity and weakness because you're so butthurt.

First-round guard Chance Warmack was a bit up-and-down this year but was generally as solid as advertised in the run game, so with his talent and pedigree, there's reason to believe he can become a solid well-rounded lineman with more experience and coaching.  

Brian Schwenke, the 4th-round center, played reasonably well after taking over the starting role, although he also had some typical rookie moments. Munchak was excited about him, and he seems to be a good prospect to continue starting going forward.  

Justin Hunter, whom we traded up to draft in the second round, has the potential to be a top-end deep threat in this league, and he did show flashes of that this season despite inconsistent playing time as he worked his way into the offense. He'll be a very exciting player to watch going into next year as he figures to assume a larger role.

So sure, it would be easier if you knew who your friends were because you are less likely so shoot them, thats true, it WOULD be easier (and we can argue until we both die about how easy it is in real life versus the game), but for me, thats just making the GAME easier for me to use, more fun to use. It causes me less frustration (like the dispersion of the guns), its entirely meta.

I'm all for in-game complexity. Blood types? i'm all for it, weather affecting your accuracy? Yep. Get sick if its cold and you're wet? you bet. Night being dark? Absolutely, they need to lock those clouds on, like with grass, so people can't run around with the clouds off playing he game in greyscale.

Fatigue, and food and energy and blood and the elements. Gunshots being super deadly (though i would like to die more slowly so i can rush to my friends aid or save a dying enemy so i can interrogate them).

But artifical 'well we can't have that because it makes the game easy' difficulty just seems like, well, making things hard for the sake of making them hard.

Can you imagine a perfectly soft curve from end to end on one brow going over the top edge but cutting through the base of the brow peaks? Maybe try combing your brows down before you mark your line, so you take only the hairs whose root is above that line and not the ones below sweeping over. On your curlier side you brush the outer half up and only take as many as it takes to match the bottom of your other brow, which looks nice already. Stay away from the brows further to the outer edge, or you might pluck them too short by accident. And don't forget to frequently step back and take in the big picture."

My gym closed at 10pm and no one was allowed in after 9:30pm so I knew that it'd be quiet if I went at 9pm. Most people want to go just after work and not right before bed and by the time I stop procrastinating it's 9pm anyway. Perfect for me and it was always quiet. Later I started going at 11am or noon but I realised that if people could go at any time they weren't likely to go at 9am. If they could go at any time why rush? So I started to go at 9 or 9:30am and it was almost as empty as 9pm.

People who work regular hours are going to either go quite early in the morning for a pre-work workout or after work, and since that's a lot of people those times are going to be busiest. School holidays are also fairly busy because there are so many people who work in schools that are on holiday at that time.

The orange and green bits are probably just dye and whatever is left of your natural pigment. You can try to remove it with a color remover if you don't want to bleach it again, but I think your safest option would be to dye over it. 

Virgin Snow is *only* for hair that has been bleached to a very pale (almost white) yellow - it won't help with anything else. And don't put lemon juice anywhere near your head - it's super acidic and it doesn't do anything good for your hair. (If anything, it likely contributed to the damage.)

It sounds like you've fried your hair quite a bit, and I'm worried that if you bleach it again it'll fall out or get gummy - stop bleaching it, dye over what you have, and baby it for a while."

Well clearly the person who saw that picture is a fucking retard. Everytime I see that picture with the same ""got to have this in my house"" I fill up with rage.

That stair case does not lift up to reveal ""a secret room"". That staircase is a stair case down to that room, with two either side of it and a single stair case leading up to the next floor. You can tell it's bullshit because there are no hinges on this uplifting staircase nor would it work as the slats from the wooden steps are leaning out over the stair case, how would it lift out if there is over hang on the steps?

Dantilli,SocialEngineering,1389366507.0,"Yeah I don't understand it either, after all it's just another skillset. Until you actually use it it's just hypothetical.

It's also perfect legal to learn martial arts where everything is designed to incapacitate and injure as efficiently as possible. Yet it's illegal and immoral to attack anybody apart from in a few very precise sets of circumstances. In fact many people would even consider self defence immoral if it injures the attacker.

So why such an uproar about learning how to manipulate social interactions? It's just like learning martial arts in my opinion. It opens your mind to thinking in different ways even if you never plan to actually use it."

A layman's theory is synonymous with guess, but it's not the definition we use when we talk about theory of evolution or theory of gravity.

Anyways, I wanted to piggyback this statement:

&gt;But you will never be able to get a truly impressive physique if all you want it for is to attract women.

I agree wholeheartedly, for the same reasons you list in the paragraphs that follow. However, I think it's also important to recognize that *men should lift weights in order to be a man amongst men.* In a way, you touched on this when you compared a P90X pussy to a bodybuilder who trains heavy.

*The Way of Men* is a book everyone should read. It's not a pickup book, but rather a philosophy book about masculinity. One of the basic assertions is that women are attracted to men who hold status among other men. The book then extols the four ""masculine virtues"" which are strength, courage, mastery, and honor. 

Strength is the base virtue. It's the least complex (be as strong as possible), but it allows all the other virtues to exist. Being physically strong leads to the other virtues, the cultivation of which allows a man to be superior to his peers and thus, desirable.

TL;DR: Lift to be a man among men, and women will notice. "

&gt; What someone is like in a combat zone is very different then what they are like at home. 

That's a very American, or Western, way of thinking. War is something that happens far away from home. Something you come back from. For most, war happens at home.

There's a response from a Serbian woman up the thread, /u/stareattheart . Heavily downvoted, of course, since she admitted that she would never date someone in the army. The usual platitudes of ""bad things happen in wars"", ""they were too poor to have a real choice about joining the army"", etc. were automatically flung at her.  Never mind that war was on her doorstep 20 years ago, that her country's army committed genocide, engaged in mass rape, ethnic cleansing and human trafficking. No, obviously she's just not *realist* enough, too naive and wooly-minded about things like killing and murder.

That's not true at all. The article itself talks about peak height velocity being 14, on average. He said he hit his own growth spurt at 15. Not exactly wildly off-center. Even if the standard deviation of that age was very low, we'd still expect a cooldown phase of still relatively rapid growth.

Sometimes if there was a game after school, I would just stay there until the game (7:30 or so) and hang out with her.  This amounted to spending between 12 and 20 hours a week with this girl throughout the four years of high school.

Flash forward to graduation, and I've managed to break the top 5 in my class academically.  I'm hanging out talking with family and friends, and she was so happy for me, and I was ecstatic, and she jumps into my arms and kisses me full on the lips in front of my family and our friends.

ZippityZoppity,DebateReligion,1389367359.0,"I think you're going above and beyond what I referring to. I was mainly speaking to the idea of memory and how all of our memories are connected. From late into gestation, human fetuses are encoding memories, even if it's the most basic of things such as this ""This is what mother's voice sounds"", ""This is how I move my leg"", etc.

All of our concepts are built on top of each other, and these are informed upon learning through observation and through being taught. You are not ""born"" with the concept of a table and what it does, it is something you acquire, just as a member from an isolated tribe that had never encountered a table before wouldn't be able to tell you what it is - they may not even be able to tell you the function of it.

We come by our first concepts and can frame them in a meaningful way using language - something that the typical human child acquires with ease. The benefit of language is that we can all communicate with each other once we all agree upon definitions for the world around us. At some point in history, someone created or had a table - a flat piece of wood resting on four long and skinny pieces of wood, and said, ""I shall call this a 'table',"" and informed everyone they knew that was what they were calling it.

So we *agree* upon commonplace labels for our sense-data, and I would say that we *can* reduce concepts to sense-data, just like I can type out the number 2 and you immediately recognize that it is the first whole integer following 1. Now, I would agree with you that our concepts are ultimately private and unknowable in the epistemological sense, but we can reasonably agree that a table is a table and not actually a chair.

I would argue that on the last point that is almost exactly the facets of reality. Our brains perceive different wave-lengths of light, and this colors our perception (literally and metaphorically). Evolution is a give and taken with nature - organisms can't evolve separately from reality and thus our beholden to it. If a table has x sense-data in reality, then the more successful organisms are going to be able to replicate x sense-data has closely as possible. We are reacting to our environment, not creating it."

Backstop,cars,1389367518.0,"A dealer should have a business insurance policy for [bailee coverage](http://www.irmi.com/online/insurance-glossary/terms/b/bailee-coverage.aspx) which handles paying for things that are damaged while they are in your care. For instance, a dry cleaner which accidentally ruins a fur coat it will pay for the value of the coat to the coat's owner... or a mechanic shop burning down it will pay the value of the cars inside to the car owners. 

I am guessing what is happening is the dealer is trying to not have a claim because the damage didn't happen in the normal course of business, they are trying to punt it off to the ZL1 owner's insurance or (less likely) the rogue employee's car insurance. 

I bet Reddit Silver that the dealer owner is one of the many **many** people that does not understand what his company insurance policy does and does not cover. Employees acting in bad faith is almost always one of the things covered, because insurance companies know that employees are not automatons. It's almost exactly the same as if an employee walked out with ten computers, except for who the check is written out to. "

TheDarkHorse83,relationships,1389367535.0,"&gt;A month and a half ago, he updated his profile on the dating app we met on

Why were you on the dating app? Looking around for another guy?

&gt;only says that he is looking for friends

Well, it got him a girlfriend, so why not some buds, too?

&gt;I could understand him just checking out the people on there, I've done it once or twice

So you are shopping around, still.

&gt;But now that I've seen him online, I can't help but think if he's only being patient with me because he's getting it from somebody else

Do you have any indication of infidelity other than his dating profile?

&gt;I've also considered snooping through his phone

If I thought that someone I was dating for only a couple of weeks had been snooping through my phone, I'd walk out, right then and there. Hell, my current SO of five years likes to go through pics of us together on my phone and it makes me uneasy. This is a massive invasion of his private space and should never be considered.

Take a deep breath. Get a driver's license (worry about a car later, but get a license first). Keep dating the guy. Uninstall/block the dating app/site. Treat him right. Work on your anxiety, self-esteem, and trust issues. Try to make this work."

of course on the other hand it gives a reason to WANT the vest and the bags because they are better at spreading out the weight than shoving three cans of beans into your hoody and going for a sprint through the hills.

&gt;If you choose to live in Quebec and have been living here for a long time, there is no reason not to have learned French. None. Its a French province. That's why its respectful and that's why that score of special little bilious Anglos shouldn't expect any respect from the pure-laine Quebeckers.

mariesoleil,vancouver,1389367918.0,"&gt;What did it have to do with you that was so wrong yo had to yell at them about it? 

It didn't have anything to do with me directly. But it's a good thing to stop someone from doing something that hurts others, even if it's just financially. The people giving tips on the rioters weren't personally affected by The Bay being looted, but they still thought it was important to help the police find them. Many people will report a drunk driver, even if they are heading the other way. It didn't affect me directly when I saw a taxi driver out of his cab and a woman yelling at each other on Rupert and Broadway at 3:00 a.m.. But I still stopped and ask what was going on. It turned out that he claimed the woman didn't pay him. I stopped because it looked like someone might be getting hurt or need help. Once I saw someone fleeing a coffee shop with a broken window and the alarms blaring at 5:00 a.m. and called the police. My action there sent someone back to jail that had gotten out two days prior.

&gt;What does it matter their race? Why even put that in?

I didn't mean to mention their race. I meant to mention their country of origin. It was relevant to my story that they lost their ability to speak English and reverted to Mandarin once they got caught doing something they shouldn't. If they had been a black couple who reverted to French, I would have said that they were a French couple if their accent was from France.

&gt;If a charity is going to give it to somebody, why can't people directly take it?

Because people suck. These people weren't homeless. They can go to thrift stores and buy these clothes just like everyone else does. I even go to thrift stores myself; I don't expect that I can just shoplift there.

&gt;If you hate confrontation why did you start one? If you are not a bully why did you start yelling at them? (As opposed to just going up and asking, like a not-bully person.) If you were so scared why did you stay?

Courage is doing something that scares you. I'm a quiet woman who even gets nervous talking to her managers, who doesn't complain if her order gets messed up. I stayed because I believed they were doing something wrong. I yelled at them because thieves don't deserve friendliness.

&gt; If you thought they were taking money from a charity, and you had a duty to 'do something about it' why didn't you donate to that charity later...or before...? 

Reporting a thief doesn't impart any other duty, just like reporting a drunk driver doesn't mean you need to donate to MADD.

&gt;Why is it OK, in your eyes, for them to take it now that you know it is a business being effected?

It's not okay. But I don't care *as much*. The Developmental Disabilities Association could use the $10 from the sale of clothing a lot more than some corporation. "

Your husband has been in a different country fighting wars the media could never begin to describe in a way that gives it justice. We, here on US soil, will never understand. How you feel, wondering if what you did/said will be what makes him snap, or if this will be the day that shit goes down hill again, or another day that weighs on your shoulders like a chore -- Those are the things he is feeling, only it takes less to get him there. As far as I have had it described to me by my friends/family out of the military, what you describe is the stress they feel, except they feel it with everyday things. Which, add more dramatic stuff on top of that, and you're in a hell-storm. Going from combat to picking up a piece of trash when you're disabled... you ask yourself why you're even alive quite a bit. How significant is a clean room compared to defending an entire people, even yourself? It's like a demotion when you've only given devotion. I couldn't imagine how I'd feel.   
  
I don't know. It is hard for people here to tell you the right thing to do, except to seek aid through the VA (SUPER IMPORTANT). No one *really* knows your everyday life. What you guys had, and what part those memories play in today. You got married when everything was wonderful and then things took a turn for the worst. Hard to predict that, and no party is responsible for the way things are now, only how you both approach progress or the end.  
  
You are his lover, his best friend, and his partner in crime. Don't weigh yourself down with the responsibility of a being a therapist or maid. If you know that you have done all possible and he can admit that it does not feel important to him, then that is a sign that it is a mutual disconnection. Sometimes, therapy really does help. (Even couples/disability therapy)  
  
I know how it is to worry about the ""snap"", but you have to talk to him. He is a man and I'm sure he believes it too, and there's nothing I've learned to be more insulting to a man than treating them like a child who has to be tiptoed around, you know? especially by the one person who's supposed to be straight and honest.

I don't know, you sound like the stalker so you tell me. In the previous post you said you looked up my posting history and noticed that I wasn't from Montreal.

&gt;Yet you claim to have the same knowledge as a local about the language issue? Right.

Ok, I'll let the cat out of the bag...yes, I'm from Ottawa. And the cool thing about Ottawa is that it is in the National Capital Region that is comprised of the Ottawa-Gatineau area. And, as you know, Gatineau is in Quebec. And a little known fact about Ottawa-Gatineau is that many people from Ottawa work in Gatineau (like me) and vice-versa. So Ottawa and Gatineau resident interact (and some even breed) so news and issues are both reported on and discussed amongst the residents in this area.

And the cool thing with radio, TV, internet and newspapers these days is that they can be used by people everywhere. Even across provincial borders. So even though my phone number doesn't start with 514, I'd say I'm pretty immersed in the Quebec language issue.

&gt;Why did you feel an urge to tell me you were bilingual? Congrats? So am I. In fact, I'm an Anglophone that learned French.

Thanks, but I'm the opposite I'm a Francophone that learned English. I brought up the fact that I was bilingual to show that my opinions (that you will ignore because I'm not a Quebecer) are not one-sided. I can and do read/listen to the French and English news and have discussions with my French and English friends and family about all things Quebec, even the language issues."

Also I would bet that the vast majority of gods don't give a shit about you, so not much risk right?

Wrong! My favorite thing about this converation is that while there are quite a few religions, nobody includes gods that human's haven't descovered/created. What if the real god is actually a dick and sends all religious people to hell? What if there's a six headed lion that feeds off of the souls that tried to be good people?

The argument is that either there is no god, and therefor it doesn't matter, or there is a god, and you stand to win or lose so you might as well act as if there is a god.

It's very clear that your fiance has an idea of what he wants his wedding to be, and you have an idea of what you want and a clear budget.  Compromise **must happen** on both sides to make you both happy.  But that's marriage, right?

SeaBrass,Magicdeckbuilding,1389368506.0,"I think that this deck is a great first effort!  Here are some thoughts:

1. Celestial Archon is a bit overcosted for what it does.  If you are looking for a large white flying creature, I recommend [Archangel of Thune](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370627), or [Serra Angel](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=370602) if you are on a budget.  [Blood Baron](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=368954) is another card of comparable converted mana cost that can win the game.  

2. The same could be said for Blightcaster.  For the same converted mana cost, [Desecration Demon](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270959) will do a lot more work.  

3. Take a look at some of the top black-white decks [here](http://www.mtgo-stats.com/archetypes/Standard/BW) and [here](http://www.mtgo-stats.com/archetypes/Standard/BW1).  Black-white is definitely an archetype that can win in Standard if built correctly.

If you don't have access to the strongest cards, then I recommend playing some drafts.  Learning to make a deck work with a limited selection of cards will help you to improve a lot as a player.  "

Read more at: http://blog.foodnetwork.com/healthyeats/2010/08/17/canned-tomatoes-good-or-bad/?oc=linkback

...canned is better than fresh. Lycopene is better absorbed when it is consumed in processed products, such as baked beans and tinned tomatoes.

Read more at: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/dietandfitness/3337326/Super-foods-tomatoes.html


I buy whole tomatoes instead of chopped because I read that canned whole tomatoes are generally the best tomatoes the cannery has to choose from. Chopped ones are more likely to be ""seconds"".

For those who really want to maximize the benefits, add olive oil when cooking canned tomatoes. It helps our bodies absorb even more lycopene.

Katterin,Christianity,1389368925.0,"My mother was raised Catholic, and my brother and I were baptized as infants although my dad was an atheist.

My brother and I were both eventually rebaptized as well when we came to that decision on our own. My younger siblings were not baptized as infants, but all chose to be eventually.

My belief is that baptism is not a prerequisite for salvation but an act of obedience. Christ commanded that we be baptized, but as you already knew and have seen on this thread, the form that takes varies widely according to how denominations interpret it.  In your situation, I think what matters is this:

1. You have been baptized.
2. You are currently living your life in commitment and obedience to Christ.
3. You respect the traditions of your chosen denomination regarding requirements for communion and church membership.

From what I can see, you're doing fine on all of these counts."

Serae,elderscrollsonline,1389369044.0,"In general when it comes to trying a new MMO I really take advantage of the first free month that most offer.  I pretty much ignore other games during this time.  If I am still able to easily and joyfully play after the first free month: I will opt to pay for a few months bundled.  If at any point my playing stops I know that my interest in the game has ended and I will not be renewing a subscription.

However, if I still play regularly, am social, and still have plenty to do: I will be paying the subscription fee.  Some games are a base $15 a month, but others offer it for less a month if you pay for a bundle at a time.  I like the bundle option because monies. :)

I understand $15 a month really adds up over time, and not everyone feels it is worth the money.  During college I could only afford once MMO at a time and chose carefully.  Now I could afford more than one, but I am conscious of our household spending.

Since my husband and I are both avid gamer we are more lenient towards gaming spending than other people might be.  However, we do always discuss it.  Think of it this way, going to a movie for two hours, will cost you at least as much as a month of game time.  It's an investment into your personal entertainment.  If you don't use it, it's a waste.  But it also depends on how you would view a worthwhile amount of time.  Did I spent 20 hours this month on the game?  Absolutely worth it.  Did I struggle through forcing myself to play for four hours?  Then it is not worth my money or my time anymore.

There have been games I dropped after the first free month.  As for ESO I will still use the same method.  I will enjoy the first month on release(obviously I won't be mentioning if I beta tested or not and am not adding it to the discussion) and if I still feel connected to the game I will seek a bundle option.  I will monitor my activity and enjoyment.  If my husband is still playing then that's a good sign as his interest is harder to keep than mine I think.  If I am still playing after my first bundle: we have a winner.  Please take my money!  Take it!

Finance wise it is not a BIG hit.  A player needs to consider their own finances and hobbies.  If you stretch your paycheck to pay for tickets to pro sports game, enjoy hitting the bar, are a shopaholic, or whatever other hobby then you need to consider where you would rather spend your time and money.  I wouldn't say that the game is pricey.  I would rather ask: what if your time, energy and activity worth to you?  Gaming isn't for everyone, nor is paying a fee.  But **when you fall in love with something, it becomes worth your time and money.**  Whether ESO will be that for people: only time will tell."

almightybob1,truetf2,1389369059.0,"&gt; When your sentry is being chipped at by a soldier, it needs to be repaired.

The idea is that you repair while the soldier is reloading. If you zap 2 out of his 4 rockets, he will have done about half damage to the sentry.

&gt;  it only takes one or two misses and your sentry is gone

This is only true if the soldier is using the Direct Hit, or your sentry is already damaged/taking damage from elsewhere. If these are not the case a soldier cannot take out a level 3 sentry with less than 3 rockets. When you have the entire flight time of a long-range rocket to judge it and get your timing right, hitting 2 out of 4 is not a big ask, and means your sentry is safe and the soldier has to reload.

The SC never required *that* much skill. It was almost equivalent timing to the airblast IIRC. Would you advocate for a faster airblast? Do you not see how that would take all the skill out of reflecting rockets?

&gt; it's now a viable option for players without amazing timing and prediction skills

The problem is that since the buff the SC doesn't require *any* timing or prediction skills. You just W+M1 into a now-powerless soldier or demo.

How are people supposed to develop timing and prediction skills if they're never required to do so? Dumbing down the weapons to suit low-skilled players just results in players staying low-skilled. 

Again, the airblast is a near-perfect example. It's not easy to do. New players often make a mess of it. But with practice, lots of people can get good at it, and some can get incredibly good. If Valve had made airblasting much much easier, there would be no need for these incredibly good people to have developed that skill.

Now think how you feel when someone reflect-kills you. I don't get mad. I'm usually just impressed. I admit I got outplayed, and acknowledge that it takes skill to do. Do you think anyone will be similarly impressed by SC spammers vs someone who was good at the SC before the nerf?"

The idea of a single religion, something created and shaped by man being something that we can call divine any longer.  The very basic tenets of religion are what is beautiful to me, and almost any religion has those basic beliefs in it that make for better people.  

I also think that we get too wrapped up in the physical world around us, too much focus on consumerism and consumption in our world.  The basic beliefs of religion, that there is something more to this life is a good starting point for looking inside of oneself and remembering that the material things around us are not as important as we make them out to be."

devonclaire,weddingplanning,1389369277.0,"What are your reservations about having a winter wedding? 

If it's weather, then consider this: Depending on where you live, there are very few months of the year where you're pretty much guaranteed to have good weather. I got married on November 2 in the Pacific Northwest, and we had the best luck ever — sunny and low 60s for the ceremony, which we had outside! It did rain at night, but that was fine, because we had an indoor reception. 

What I am saying is that unless you move your wedding to July or August, you can't guarantee that you'll have great weather, and even then, it's a toss up. Sometimes it rains in July, and sometimes it's too hot in August (and vice versa). No matter what season your wedding is in, you have to prepare for bad weather and have a backup plan. 

I think winter weddings are fine, and you're probably going to save money by having it during non-peak wedding season. 

Whatever you decide, remember not to make any more big wedding decisions without giving them some thought. Don't let your FMIL or other family members run with an idea that you haven't committed to. 

Either way, remember it will be your wedding day and the weather is not the most important thing going on! :)"

mariesoleil,changemyview,1389369323.0,"I do get annoyed by submissions that are very similar to ones posted five times in the same week. However, it's not something that can be avoided. I think it's human nature to think that you're so special and that your views and experiences are not similar to those of others.

I swear half /r/bisexual OPs are some variation on ""I'm a straight guy, not attracted to men, but I fantasize about sucking cock.

/r/actuallesbians is filled with ""How do I meet girls even though I'm closeted and don't want to tell anyone I'm gay?"" and ""She's really friendly, does she like me?""

/r/asktransgender is full of ""I've always wanted to be a woman, could I be transgender,"" ""I think I'm transgender but I like men/women,"" and ""Is it okay if I still want to keep my penis?""

As you can probably tell, much of my activity on reddit is in LGBT subreddits. So in /r/changemyview, the repeat topic that sticks out to me is so many variations on ""transgender people can't really change their sex/gender."" There were so many when the news of Chelsea Manning wanting to transition was really popular. Even now, there's probably at least five a week. But I think people in general are just really bad at understanding that their opinion isn't really that unique.

So I think repeat topic submissions are an expected and unavoidable side effect of having a popular subreddit about views and opinions. If we tried to prevent them, that wouldn't help change the views of those who think their view is different, even if I might think they are similar. "

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389369347.0,"&gt;  So while the venue is dirt cheap ($350), we'd end up spending extra for the catering because we'd need everything else

This is the route we've decided to go; our venue provides a roof, tables, and chairs, and we're required to bring in linens, catering, alcohol, decor, etc.  

&gt;  Also: We've already been engaged a year.

I assume that means you've already been saving for a year?  To drop thousands of dollars on something (whether it's $5K or $15K), you should already be saving.

My budget is similar to yours, but I live in Texas, and our COL is lower here.  I think your wedding budget should be closer to $10K than $5K if you're expecting to do something remotely traditional.  I can't recommend going into debt for a wedding, so I suggest y'all discuss how much you can realistically save, and then set a date based on how long it will take you.

Also, divide up the labor:  Since your FH doesn't seem to understand how expensive venues and catering can be, give him the task of researching those two vendors and compiling a list of prices and inclusions.  You can focus on photography and floral at the same time.  Someone will have to research honeymoons.  If you're both spending time researching, you're both involved and thus there will be less work for one person.  This will allow allow him to see first hand all the work that goes into research, and the prices that are out there."

There are a ton of processes going on that you have no conscious awareness off (most of your brain is devoted to those processes, as a matter of fact, the portion that provides ""consciousness"" is quite small). 

If you were to lose your visual cortex, you would have no perception of sight, and you might mourn the loss of your vision. However, you would still be able to take in and process motion and respond reflexively to e. G. accurately track moving objects with your finger, catch things thrown at you, etc. this is because there are a variety of other, older parts of your brain that handle processing of visual data. You have no awareness of that, but it happens constantly and without it you could not function. 

There are hundreds upon hundreds of similar processes that you rely on without even knowing about them. Most of your decision making seems to be conscious and volitional, but it's probably not. In short, the percentage of yourself, as an intelligent being, that is associated with consciousness is minute. It is amusing how much people tend to associate self with something that is a really small part of their overall being. 

---

Additionally, those same processes are going on in the bodies of people all around you all the time, and at different scales and to different extents in other biological organisms all over the planet. Does your having no perception of them mean that they have no relation to you? Would suffering from cortical blindness mean that your vision, which is still being processed somewhere, is not relevant to you because you don't perceive it?

What is it that separates perception of self from perception of other?

If something as small as a human brain can have consciousness, how can one assume that a collection of 5 billion brains cannot? 

When one considers it from a standpoint of complexity in self organizing systems, informational density and transmission, it seems ludicrous to say that one human is more alive than 5 billion who share a hugely varied number of channels of communication, from pheremonal to linguistic. 

Take that further out to the universe as a whole. The amount of information and complexity encoded by all life on earth, and all the technology we have created is a rounding error within the scope of the universe. Who is to say what sorts of higher order self-organizing systems exist at that scale?

I'm not trying to provide you with dogma, or even resolve any of these issues. I am just trying to make the point that there is a lot more to life, the universe, and everything. "

iheartazngirls,AskReddit,1389369573.0,"TL:DR; Istanbul. An ""undercover cop"" (or an armed citizen). A bar full of locals. 42 shots of tequila one cute turkish girl and a broken finger.

Okay guys you asked for it wall of text incoming

Well my brother and I were in Istanbul for a vacation and being the adventurous young lads that we are we decided to look for a place to raise a glass or twenty for the evening. As we wandered the Taksim area we were approached by a guy who told us that he has ""very pretty girls"" in his bar and that seemed like a good enough reason to check it out. We sat down in what appeared to be a strip club but to our disappointment everyone had there clothes on. Being sober we noticed the menu was suspiciously missing prices so we asked the waiter type person how much for a beer? Turns out the price came out to something close to $20 USD so we noped it out of there pretty quickly. The first guy who invited us kind of tried to get us to come back by chasing us and talking/yelling at us a bit so we ducked into the next place we saw. This place as it turns out is a pretty popular drinking hole for the locals and we weren't planning to stay but it seemed pretty relaxing and the music was good so we did. So far in Turkey we had met nothing but awesome, nice and friendly people so we weren't that concerned. We made friends with the bartender and some of the patrons as well as two girls who were also hanging out there. The way my brother and I make friends is to drink ridiculous amounts of alcohol with new people until we're all bff's 4lyfe so we were well on our way to this stage when the cuter of the two girls started flirting with me a lot. She was standing too close, whispering in my ear, grabbing at my hand... the whole nine yards. I'm probably five tequila shots past tipsy and she was pretty cute so I'm really against it. Maybe an hour later this short but bulky guy walks in joins our group starts talking to us and by this point me and cute turkish girl are holding hands or whatever and flirting big time. He keeps looking over at us now and then and eventually comes over and starts a ""friendly"" conversation with me in which he right away informs me he's an undercover cop (this guy was kind of shady so I have a hard time believing it), tells me that the girl I'm holding hands with is his sister but he doesn't mind us talking and at some point he mentions he has a gun and then shows me his gun tucked into the back of his pants in his waistband (isn't this unsafe carrying of a firearm? beats me). At this point I've let go of the turkish girl and probably pushed her a good 10 feet away from me and I'm attempting to signal my brother that its high time to gtfo there. He notices my panic-y not very subtle signs that something is majorly wrong, we excuse ourselves for a ""phone call"" and high tail it out of there. I was so inebriated that when we were running to get into a taxi I slammed the door on my finger and it's been broken ever since (never had it checked out but it still hurts a lot to this day). Although we had this one off experience on one night in one place I still highly recommend visiting there as it's one of the most beautiful countries I've ever visited"

Also, the DJ sped up the song my dad and I had practiced to a little bit (to give the DJ credit, he didn't know that this would impact us), and so we were really surprised by the tempo. The father/daughter dance was great, but there were a lot of things I couldn't see beforehand that kind of messed it up. Of course, no one noticed except for me and my dad. "

tigertealc,chemistry,1389369634.0,"&gt;So... Am I looking at this too rigid? As in, I am looking at it that the HOMO should have two electrons and no more, but in fact the electron density around the molecule is more fluid like? Why is the density wanting to move higher in energy to the HOMO? Are the orbitals from the electron donating group that are contributing to the MOs initially higher in energy

Yes to all of this. I think a good way for you to conceptualize this is to draw the energy diagram for the formation of the MOs. Let's take the above examples. The lone pair from the methoxy is an atomic orbital, and it is going to blend with the pi electrons of ethylene. Since bonding electrons are lower in energy than non-bonding electrons, in the new MO of methoxyethylene, the energy of HOMO must increase in energy in relation to ethylene. So now, in this MO, we have lowered the energy of the lone pair and increased the energy of the pi-electrons, since what makes the HOMO is no longer just those two electrons of the pi bond, but is now a combination of the pi electrons and the lone pair of electrons.

In fact, that example doesn't even come close, because 5 years is a huge portion of 80 years compared to a human lifetime vs. *eternity.* 

here's another thing: i don't know how much stock you put in the old testament, but the story of god asking abraham to kill his son has always seemed like *absolute* lunacy to me. if today a man tied up his son and intended to kill him because ""God spoke to him and told him so"" every normal, logical person would lock that guy away. 

a third thing that has always seemed illogical to me:

the miracles jesus performed are one of the things that signified to everyone that he was the son of god. however, if you walked into a theater in Vegas and saw a man turn water into wine, you'd say ""that's a trick, he's a magician."" if you saw Criss Angel walk on water, you'd say ""that's an illusion, obviously it's not real."" so why would you believe stories about another man who did those things?

For example, if I have car insurance and my car is totaled, I'll get somewhere near the value of the car back.  If I have just started my policy, and have only paid one payment, then I'll receive more from the insurance company than I have paid in, even though I have not received more than was lost in the totaling of the car.

But premiums are valued such that the average insured person loses money on the deal, so the insurance company can profit (to justify the company's existence).  So the typical person should avoid any insurance coverage other than that which protects them from unsustainable loss.  A better solution is to put premium-equivalent money in a bank or under a mattress each month.

In the case of fire insurance, I would not recommend the mattress."

Paaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa,AskMen,1389370153.0,"The only ""true"" way to be considered masculine by anyone is to do all of the following:

Note: a lot of what I'm going to say is going to sound misogynistic as hell. This is from a traditionalist male perspective, not my own.

Make a lot of money without much effort on your part.

Have a larger than average penis, whether or not women prefer them (I don't think we will ever know for sure).

Lose your virginity by the end of high school. Any longer, and women will be more likely to reject you since they will think you won't know how to please them. 

At the same time, you must be having casual sex on a weekly basis unless you're in a committed relationship, whether you want to or not. If not, people will perceive you as a loser.

Dating any woman who is not conventionally attractive means that you're desperate and can't get any better.

You must be able to pleasure a woman without her instructing you how to do so. A woman must orgasm every time you have sex, otherwise you've failed in your duty as a man. 

You must be dominant at all times. In all situations. Any moment of emotional sensitivity will cause the woman to think you're a sissy-man and find an alpha to fuck. 

Your woman of the moment can and will leave you at any moment. There's always another man who is sexier, funnier, richer and better in bed than you. 

If you don't have a big cock, you better be good looking. If you're not good looking, you better be rich. If you're not rich, you better be charismatic. If you're none of these things, slit your fucking wrists, God hates you.

Now, firstly, how many men can possibly achieve any of this to begin with? These are expectations beyond comprehension. 

Now imagine that ever since you hit puberty, these values have been forced into your head by men and women alike. And since you can't accomplish any of this, you're constantly going to wonder how a woman could ever find someone like you desirable

Obviously, it's not like women have it easy in this department, and they have an entirely different set of issues to deal with, which are just as awful, If not more so.

All of this is awful for both genders. It seriously needs to change. Not being a woman, I can't properly articulate the issues women deal with concerning sexuality and their bodies. 

Personally speaking, all of this is why I'm deeply afraid of interacting with women, though I force myself to do so. I can't process what about me a woman could possibly want, as I'm not the big-dicked tan Adonis that I've been told for years is all they want. I look in the mirror and hate everything about myself, because of this. It's irrational, but it happens anyway. And tons of men deal with the same problem, millions of them.

Remember I'm speaking from a male perspective, I'm not saying women have it easy. 

I'm not sure how to fix this, but someone or something needs to, or we're going to be the next Japan, where their backwards and totally fucked up romance customs have crippled their population in fear of each other. We're going to turn into that if we don't do something. 

I hope this illustrates the shit men have to deal with on a daily basis. Neither gender can compete with inflated expectations, and so many men and women genuinely think this is the way things should be, inflated expectations for both genders and all.

I hope this stops. I can't fucking take it anymore.

SCphotog,AskWomen,1389370157.0,"Made me go and dig it up... You are right...I don't think 'discrepancy' is the right word, but I get your meaning.

I think the point is, as is quoted below from the article, the flaccid size is not a good indicator of erect size.

""There is a much wider range of size in men's penises when flaccid, with the average ranging from 1 to 4 inches. In general, smaller flaccid penises lengthen at erection by a greater percentage than do larger flaccid penises, with most men reaching an average size of 5 to 7 inches, so the flaccid size of a penis is not a good predictor of erect size. The vast majority of men measure within the average genital size range and have a penis size that is more than adequate for sexual functioning.""

elemonated,AsianParentStories,1389370390.0,"...Man, she's a freaking toddler. Jesus, my mom didn't get psychotic until I started going to school.

1. The kid's supposed to frustrate the crap out of you. That's why they're so cute. So that you don't kill them when they stress you out. Evolution pulled out all the stops on their appearance because they're honestly just incredibly useless for a really long time.

2. If you need a breather, ask for it. I presume you have a wife, but even if you're a single father, ask a trusted friend or coworker to take her off your hands for a bit. They say a child takes a village to raise. Honestly, I think that's why a lot of well-meaning American first parents in general have such a hard time of it. They think they have to do everything on their own. If you're still in touch with your parents, talk to your parents and they'll tell you how much of a little shit you were too.

3. Identify why you think this way, and instead of ""OH, this is my process, *good*, let's continue doing this because my intentions are good"" like most Asian parents do, make the thought process more constructive. Maybe look up a few anger management tips, those are great for keeping stress to a manageable level.

4. For at least the potty training, just remember that it literally doesn't help anyone to get mad at a toddler. No one. It won't help her do better, she has no concept of ""trying harder"", ""being lazy"", or ""giving up"", she doesn't know how to control her bladder because it was literally like *breathing* to her just a a year ago."

robinhoode,BitcoinSerious,1389370395.0,"&gt; But how? Because the bitcoin network doesn't recognize the concept of a ""pool"". It only has nodes, and if some of them finds (=mines) a new block, it is propagated to other nodes, which will accept it if its blockchain is longer than their current one. But the network doesn't care about what is behind those nodes, it can be single computer as well as a huge farm. The network just cares about if that node could come up with a new block; it could know the node size only if the node itself would reveal it voluntarily.

So you can think of each solo-miner as a ""pool of one"". If a group of users want to mask their identity and mine as simply one node in the network, then the hash-rate for that ""pool"" would have to be proportional to their hashing strength.

I'm thinking of a model (a set of mathematical equations) which takes variables:

* M = the majority of the hashing power. It's a constant and people usually set M = 51%, but we can be more cautious and set this to M = 35%.
* P = the number of pools
* i = some number between 1 and P (used for indexing below)
* N_i = the size of the given pool
* D_i = the hash difficulty for pool i
* S_i = the strength of pool i, such that the sum of all S_i = 100%

All of these variables are known by each node. At some regular interval, we update all the D_i for each pool P_i. We need a set of equations that satisfy the constraints:

* Pools with N_i = 1 are reasonable profitable
* Pools with N_i &gt; 1 are only slightly more profitable than N_i &gt; 1
* A pool P_i with it's strength S_i &gt; M is less profitable than one with S_i &lt; M

In fact, we could simply remove the 2nd constraint, and simply work with the 3rd constraint.

Feel free to poke a hole in the model. I'm just trying to provide some starting point for this discussion, since I feel it's one we need to have."

I have no idea how much this will cost in Ireland rather than UK. The important things are, if you want optimal performance in Skyrim, you absolutely need a 2GB graphics card with enough horsepower to use that much VRAM, that means minimum a radeon 7850. If you can find a 2GB gtx 660 for any cheaper, that is the best option from nvidia. A new i3 with whatever the cheapest 1150 socket motherboard is perfectly good. If this is still too much, see if you can ditch the optical drive (borrow one to install the OS, or make a USB install drive if you can). It's hard to cut any more cost out without seriously hurting your performance. You could drop to 4GB of RAM or get a smaller, cheaper hard drive. If that's still too much, get an i3-3000 series (Ivy Bridge) although the newer one is definitely better and only about £6 more. 

edit: you can get everything above on dabs.ie at a good price. They have an XFX 2GB 7850 rather than the MSI, that's fine, it's still high quality. Also a gigabyte motherboard rather than MSI. You can stick with your original case if you want, it is cheaper by 15 euros. The only thing they don't have good prices on is the monitors, you should shop around, look for a 1080p IPS monitor. "

If anything Bioshock is more of a retrofuturistic story, not unlike its inspiration Atlas Shrugged, or Sky Captain, The Incredibles, etc. It's placed at a very specific time, which has a lot of historical context and social implications.

mandym347,Pathfinder_RPG,1389370657.0,"Immerse your players as much as possible if you want to encourage RP (and really, RP is the best part of the game for many).

Call players by their character names and try to make character portraits visible (print outs on the table or wall, back of DM screen, cut out little print outs for use as tokens on the board, etc.).  

Let them talk things out in-character whenever possible... your job is to be the chess master, not just the exposition-machine, so if you want to inform the druid in the party that he recognizes the writing above the door as a riddle written in Sylvan, pass him a note and let him tell the others his own way.

Know that the players WILL screw up your perfect, lovingly-crafted story.  This is their nature, their purpose, their joy and goal.  It's okay.  Be flexible and come up with reasonable NPC reactions to their actions and reward them for creative thinking.  Instead of saying, ""You aren't supposed to do that!"" say, ""Hm, that's something I didn't plan for.  Let's see how it plays out in-character.""  You are not the only storyteller; you come up with an outline, then you and the players fill in the details and add the ending together.

Make props when you can.  I had my players find an old scroll with Important Plot Information in an old desk.  Instead of saying, ""You find a scroll that says..."" I tossed them a rolled up piece of paper tied with a string that I had written out the day before.  The NPC who wrote it was in a bad state of mind, so I did cursive to be pretty but with a shaky hand and lots of smears and scribbles.  The players responded really well.

Sound effects work really well to set the mood.  My group always has some kind of music up.. usually themes or battle music from our favorite video games, sometimes weird stuff like O Fortuna.  You can find lots of neat things by searching YouTube with terms like ""classic Halloween music spooky"" or ""classic [love/adventure/mystery] themes.""  There's an app also I have on my tablet called Fantasy Soundboard that does sound effects of sword blows, dragon roars, gnoll cackles, etc."

flclimber,AskReddit,1389370783.0,"I was religious until I read the bible. Let that sink in for a second. The main text of my religion caused me to lose my faith. It's easy to pick out parts that you like. Be good to your neighbor, turn the other cheek, etc. What I didn't realize is the fact that good morality only covers what seems to be 1% of the text.

What else is in there you ask? How to keep and treat your slaves. If you rape a woman and take her virginity, she better damn well become your wife. Not only that, but just think of how many wars were started in the name of religion. The crusades, for instance. How psychotic were these Christians when they truly believed God was on their side. The crusaders are to Christianity what the WTC bombers are to Islam.

And then there's the notion that homosexuality is wrong. It doesn't affect them in any way, but two guys who love each other can't get married because you say your god thinks it's wrong? Blow me. Abortion is wrong too? Even if the mother and/or child will die without it? Love thy neighbor, my ass. 

I refer to myself as apathetic, or an apatheist. I don't care if there is or isn't a higher power, I'm going to live my life according to my own moral compass. If there isn't a god, nothing is lost. If there is a god, and he decides to judge me, he will take note of my actions and realize I led a good life, and treated others with kindness. If he actually supports the rape, murder, and genocide in the bible, and claimed by people in his name, then I don't want to go to heaven. 

TL;DR I don't have a problem with God, it's his fanclub I can't stand.

Eponia,todayilearned,1389370853.0,"We know so much more about Orcas now. For instance, now we know that they don't easily integrate back into whatever happens to be the nearest pod, and if they were born in captivity, they never will. Each pod has their own language and culture, though surrounding ones may be similar (in the same way that languages have local dialects and cultures have subtle shifts depending on locality). So the best chance you have of releasing a wild born Orca back into the wild would be to release it near it's original pod. Even that isn't a guarantee though. I kind of equate it to the wild children that are occasionally found. Most of them, depending on what age and for how long they were wild, never become fully functioning members of society. They spent formative years completely without human interaction and it's clear just how crucial that is for language and critical thinking skills. It'd be the same for an Orca, they'd spent their entire lives away from their own species, isolated in concrete pools with their only contact being with humans. Humans become their pod. It's incredibly difficult to release a captive Orca back into the wild and have it return to being actually wild."

Someone has to take charge and solve the problems in a relationship which fits perfectly into the dynamic of D/S / M/S. 

As society in general moved from the ""50's"" style household where you did have someone firmly in charge; this is what we ended up with, generations of people simply unable to solve common problems on their own. You are starting to see that come full circle though more and more often with women in charge of the household.

Someone has to wear the pants in the relationship; how well that someone wears said pants is the largest determining factor in its success. Not to say its impossible for two people to trade off on it equally but I have met very few couples, BDSM or otherwise that do so very well in the long term.

There are no wyverns, the dragons are indeed dragons. Akatosh is depicted as a dragon, he's a Aedra who looks like a dragon and the other dragons are dragons. Just because they are all dragon's doesn't mean they are equal, the concept of gradiance is a big thing in the TES world. Peryite presents himself as a dragon, its hinted that it may be an attempt at mockery but he just looks like a dragon. He's a Daedra first and foremost, he can physically appear to be anything.

The dragons fought by the LDB are absolutely the real thing. The Aedra and Daedra are just that, they aren't dragons.

____

Looking through [my stuff](/r/teslore/w/compilationauthor#wiki_myrrlyn), I'd say that I ~~need to write more Orcpocrypha already~~ tend towards encyclopedic/scholastic tracts (with the exception of three stories) which seems to be what you want. The downside of my specializing in Orcs is that we don't *have* a lot of hard-canon information on them as far as details go because they're ~~fantasy tropes~~ ^^screw ^^you ^^MK monster races for 40% of the main series. I'm actually working (or at least pretending to, because progress is **slow**) on an Encyclopedia Orsimeris, but to make it comprehensive, I've found that I need to invent a fair amount of the material.

So that's a disclaimer for any Orc writing on which I'm called.

My English is very good and I'm told that my inherent writing style is well-oriented towards technical writing and essays, and my TSG experience throws in a dash of character building and storytelling as well. I absolutely love working with small-scale details, so I suppose in addition to spinning Orc info I'd be good with proofreading, style adjustment, and environment consistency.

Full disclosure; I just switched majors so this semester will be really light for me, but the next two years will be really **heavy**. I asked to be removed from active duty on the [NUMINIT]^1 Project and if I think I'm capable of returning (and am accepted) that will further detract from the effort I can put into this.

Fuller disclosure: I've literally never touched a tabletop RPG before.

I actually know quite a few women who would be interested in dating a physically fit submissive male, but not when he attaches such self loathing to it.

nickgreen90,AskReddit,1389371149.0,"There have been a lot of people in this thread with the same line of reasoning as me, but I figure I'll tell my story as well. I was born and raised in North Carolina, the US. My mother was always a heavily Christian woman and my father was agnostic. When I was young, my mother forced my father not to tell me about his religious views because she wanted me to grow up with Christian values. When I got a lot older, this really helped put a bad taste in my mouth.

From the beginning though, I was always questioning the logical inconsistencies in the bible. I didn't see how I should put my ""faith"" in something when I'd never felt it. I'd never been lucky, I'd never seen a shred of evidence of HIS presence. Why should I believe in something that I don't know is there? Why should I waste what is presumably my only time here on this earth devoting my time to the wills of a deity that may or may not even exist? Clearly my thoughts weren't that well voiced as a child, nor as coordinated, but this was my basic line of reasoning.

As I got older, I found a resurgence in faith as my life started to improve slightly late in middle school. I assumed that this was the work of God, and because I feared hell, I forced myself to stay away from temptation and sin. But time went on and I began to realize that some of my friends and the people around me were atheists. I started to see the ridiculous condemnations of the bible (anti-gay, burn in hell for not believing in me, I'll give you free will but don't ever go against what I say, etc.) I started to realize that the bible was a book written by men. Men with different opinions. Men all claiming divine intervention. I thought to myself, ""Why should I trust these men any more than the man on the street corner claiming to see angels? What makes them any more credible?"" 

I went on to find out about how chapters of the bible were cast out in the dead sea scrolls, how man had every way of manipulating the book to say what they wanted it to say. How on earth could we base an entire religion around THIS? I started seeing atheist concepts, things that religion had caused that were disgusting (religious wars, terrorism, the crusades), and different ways of viewing god. After a while I saw that the devil was becoming more admirable to me than god. I saw a picture that showed all of the things you could get sent to hell for, and only a few of them were truly disgusting. The rest all seemed like normal things, interests of different people but not necessarily bad.

The last straw was when I found out how bad depression and anxiety could get. I prayed, and prayed, and PRAYED. Nothing happened. I sought help on my own, but in the end the only thing that would solve my problem was science and time. I decided that with all of the evidence I had seen, even if there was a god out there, he wasn't one I wanted to believe in. So I became agnostic.

About a year ago, I saw a thread on askreddit that described life after death, and if you've seen a thread like that, you can probably guess that I came to terms with being an atheist. Even now, I still dislike religion, but I don't have anything against religious people. So, that's my story."

At the end of the day we don't know what Jesus actually said (lacking first hand writings) and any sort of detail regarding anything but the broadest details of his life comes from writers who professed a religious belief in him and probably weren't interesting in writing a sober (and secular) historical text

What you can try is using something like Oxyclean on the stain. You can make a paste and let it sit for a while. Oxyclean is pretty safe but it can rot the fibers if you make it too strong and/or let it sit too long. Hydrogen peroxide is another option. Wash in cold water.

Another thing to do is pour liquid detergent into the stain, rub it in and let it sit for at least an hour. Then wash in cold water.

After about an hour on unbelievably bumpy, rutted roads my wife says to the driver she needs to pee, it's not urgent but at the next opportunity would he please stop.  He says ok.  15 minutes pass and we have even gone through a small town.  He hasn't stopped.  
She tells him again, please stop soon, I really need to pee.

Around the next bend we see what I can only describe as a hovel, half cinder blocks, half rotten plywood walls, corrugated roof. But it has a ""Coke"" sign and a ""Belikin Beer"" sign.  It's a store of some kind.  
We pull in and my wife looks at me and says, you're coming with me.  
We head in and ask for the bathroom, toilet, WC, or baño.  They say sorry we don't have one.  I say you don't understand she has to go, can we go out back for some privacy?  He shrugs and says, um this way and waves us behind the counter.  We go out the back door and he points to an ""outhouse"" it was part plastic port-a-potty part wood siding and it was up on cinder blocks, which were formed the base of a heap of trash and rubble behind it.  The heap was taller than the outhouse.  The smell is a mix of rotting garbage and shit.  I open the door and find a toilet bowl, no water closet, no plumbing, no seat.  Just the lower bowl part screwed  on some 2x4's  My wife has to piss so bad at this point she doesn't care.  She pushes past me climbs up so she is squatting on the rim of the bowl.  She is pissing like Niagara Falls.  The look on her face is a mix of anger, disgust, and relief all at once.  She grits her teeth and says, the bowl is full of shit, it is taking every thing I have not to vomit right now.

So even when you do acquire more fans, even if they love the work you do, they won't see your posts and statuses unless you pay to promote your posts, or if they manually check off ""show posts in my newsfeed"" on your page, which, hardly any fans will do.

So instead of paying for your post to appear in target market feeds, you'll also be paying for your post to appear in your fans' feeds.

Using Facebook for growth and to find new fans of your work just isn't working anymore. [Organic reach is becoming a thing of the past](http://www.steamfeed.com/facebook-pages-organic-reach-down/).

So if your end goal is to get more traffic or business, Facebook won't be able to help you very much, and will probably be more of a waste of time and money, and I'd start to look at other methods. "

The one that makes her feel good. And learning how to do that takes practice. Practice requires time, and if you're trying to improve your career, you won't have as much free time.

This friend of mine from the Navy refuses to answer the question ""What do you do for a living?"" He hates answering it and usually gives you a BS answer like ""I am trying to change the world"". 

The fact is your opinion is not the concensus. The vast majority of men who do PU on a regular basis want to get their lay count into the 100's, and have no problem sacrificing the possibility of a good career for that count."

It's broad but it gives the community an idea of what you're looking at improving in the future and the direction your taking the game. No set date, but issues that you've acknowledged or features that are for sure being worked on with the intent of releasing.

After that I realized she was dead serious about everything and that her best argument is ""because that's how it is"" and from that point in time I pretty much laughed in the face of everyone who said he/she is religious. Yeah, I was a little prick back then.

Nowadays, I still think it's ridicoulus to be a believer, but as long as you don't try to convert me, I don't mind your believes, because what I believe is everyone has the right to believe whatever the hell they want, doesn't matter how ridicoulus it is.

As for the organization parts of the religions, I do admire them, because I honestly think they pulled off the biggest scam of the history, but I also believe if a religious community wants to have a church of some kind, they should pay for everything necessary to sustain it.

Rokr175,AskReddit,1389371935.0,"My condolences go out to you. However, if I may, I would like to try and shed some light on why something like this happens.

There's actually a whole reason behind why ""good people"" die. As a Christian, the whole argument boils down to the concept of good and evil. It's not that God *wanted* you to suffer and said ""I'm taking your mother just because I feel like it. There's always a purpose for it. He has a plan for each and every one of our lives and decides when it's our time to go as He sees fit. Furthermore, backing up a bit, God isn't the one to blame. It's us. We are the ones who brought sin into this world. With that sin comes all the bad things that affect us everyday: death, disease, lying, stealing, mourning etc. None of this was supposed to happen. However, this is how things *must* be in order for God to carry out his plan of allowing us to make our own decisions. He loves us enough that he actually allowed us to try and make our own decisions instead of simply forcing us all, or creating us all, to believe the same thing. Therefore, in order to make a choice, there has to be a good side and a bad side. In order for there to be ""good"" there must be ""evil"" to compare it to. This evil must exist and therefore is what causes all the negative aspects I've mentioned. God didn't ""kill' your mother because he was angry with you. She died because that's just how our world works. That's why it's our job to try and come as close to God as possible, because we never know when our time is up. He loved your mother more than you could ever imagine, and loves the rest of us just as much. This turned into a sort of ramble but I could probably try to go into specifics (although it may not be *too* specific). Things get really complicated when trying to explain things like this, but if I could at least make sense to one person, then I've done my part.

As you can guess, the dating service in question is the side-project of a very well-known hate website that I'd prefer not to mention here. According to polling (and data), black males and black females typically have low response rates on traditional dating sites (i.e. OKCupid, match.com, etc.); and obviously, this is caused by the fact that most people choose to date within their own ethnic group. People have preferences, and it isn't unreasonable that a black person might want to sign up for a dating service that will give them a normal rate of response by matching them with partners of their own race.

Also, HBCUs are not a form of segregation; as a white person, you are perfectly free to apply to any historically black college in this nation (and, at some HBCUs, white students are given discounts due to their status as ""minorities"" on the campus).

No, OP isn't posting the same exact looks constantly. No one's saying they're exactly the same. But if you look at all these pics of her open eyes, there's really no difference. Yes, different products, but same outcome. No one is doubting that OP is skilled... and this certainly has nothing to do with her skin color. I'd personally just like to see her try something a little different, so it's not almost the same look repeated over and over again.

It would be different if the looks she always does were done by a bunch of different people instead of one, because it'd be an opportunity to see how it looks on different facial structures. It would get a little tiresome, but at least you can see how different eye shapes can pull it off. When someone constantly posts the same look over and over, it's different.

And this can be explained by genes. I agree that it is a problem for empiricism in the strict sense of it, which I suppose should be distinguished from. I'm not well-versed in philosophical terms - is that the school of thought known as ""logical empiricism""? In that, the majority of knowledge is acquired through empirical means, but is done so through such faculties that are innate in the human genome.

robinhoode,askseddit,1389372434.0,"&gt; I've never met a single person who sacrificed their career to sleep with more women.

Maybe they never had a career to begin with because they were still unsure what they wanted to do with their lives. So they party and pick up women to pass the time.

&gt; Also, most guys I know don't give a fuck about their lay count, they want to score quality pussy. I could go bang a 7 any day, but I want that 9 or 10. 

There was a thread in /r/seduction with the question ""What type of women do you want, seriously?"", trying to ask a genuine question about the variety and type they are attracted to. The top comment? ""The ones with vaginas"". 

Sure, it's probably a big joke, but there's some truth to it. The top follow-up comment was something like ""This guy knows what's up. That's real abundance."" Being horny lowers your standards, and I'm sure there's lots of guys into PUA because they have higher levels of testosterone than the average man.

The fact is that 9's and 10's are, by their very labeling, more rare than women at 8 and below. They would effectively be the top 20% of women. So the statement ""I chase after 9's and 10's"" says that you don't necessarily believe in abundance theory (which I'm inclined to agree with, to be honest). Or perhaps you do believe it, but the way you label them seems to disagree.

I'm not trying to pick on you or anyone one particular person, but the general set of beliefs that this community has been pushed on to new-comers or those looking for advice. It's rather warped and distant from reality."

The only difference is that there is nothing in existence that people are claiming was cause be dinosaurs or unicorns. You'd be much better off using Big Foot moving forward. "

Neopopulas,dayz,1389372527.0,"I'm totally down with what you're saying, but i think we're going to disagree on a core aspect. Maybe if the in-game chat was a little better, because it tells you where the sound is coming from, but the problem is still the same.

If i look down sites, and see a guy in green, with a gasmask, it COULD me by friend, or it could be an enemy. Now, in real life, the way he's walking, and standing, the small things he's carrying in his vest or pockets (his glasses, his smokes, his tags, a photo) the way he just moves would tell me a lot about who he is and i'd learn to recognize that as my friend.

But that sort of awareness doesn't exist in the game, so instead, i have to go 'hey, is that you' and he'll have to go 'yeah, its me' and hopefully we know where each other is, now thats not that bad (if you don't worry about lag and whatnot making a half second exchange into one that is 3 or more seconds long)

But normally, i'd recognize him anyway, probably, problem is, in that three second exchange, i could be killed by this guy that isn't my friend, because i couldn't spot my friend from 8 feet away because he looks like a clone of most other guys I run into. All the HUD does is, when i look at him, i should reasonably, in game, recognize my friend by all the little things i mentioned, all its doing is telling me, in a meta way, the game just tells me 'you should recognize this guy' because no game can be realistic enough to make that sort of recognition possible.

I guess i'm sort of confused by the venom i'm catching from some people, people go on and on about how it breaks realism and stuff, but no one seems to be able to accept that no game is capable of giving you the feedback that in reality, you get day-to-day, which lets you recognize people. They seem to tied up with the idea of some huge floating HUD (or for some reason, minimap) breaking realism, they may be forgetting that some realism is lost by the lack of enough detail to make situational awareness realistic.

I mean just look around in this thread and you'll see how many people are jumping all over me for the simple suggestion and props to them for their enthusiasm i guess but i wonder if they are stuck too far to one side. Maybe i'm too far the other way, i'll admit that."

I do recommend her. She wasn't bothered at all that I didn't know at a young age, didn't think it was unusual that I only started questioning in my late 20's. I wasn't good at talking about myself, but she was patient!

If you can afford it and you have a GP, this is a good route to go. Get your GP to refer you to Dr. Dahl at VGH, he's a great endo and very friendly. If you are out more in the Valley there is Dr. Tregoning in Abbotsford. Unfortunately, his desk lady is a giant bitch who seems to resent that her boss works with trans people.

robinhoode,askseddit,1389372795.0,"&gt; If I want to take a girl home I will, but I'm successful every time I go out because my goal is to have fun, and sometimes a girl wants to join me. 

Again, this is the type of mentality I run across. If you decide that ""having fun"" is the goal, why not stay at home? Because you want to go out? Okay, sure. I can appreciate that. However, if you've changed your goal from ""I want to get laid"" to ""I just want to go out"", then why not change it to ""I want to go out"" to ""I want to stay home""?

To me, happiness is not defined by where I am physically. It's where I am mentally, so going out has no affect on me. Perhaps it does for you, but I can't change my opinion based on that information.

&gt; And no, I have no disabilities. I'm 6-3 and would have been the posterchild for the Hitler Youth program. 

Most millionares claim to be ""self-made"" but a lot of them come from affluent families. A lot of top mathematicians talk about hard work, but were tutored from a young age and became entrenched in problem solving by the age of 10.

When I hear the opinion of the successful, who tell me that being successful has nothing to do with background, I'm immediately skeptical and ask for more details. So I'm not surprised that you've got a few genetic advantages. I think you should play to your strengths, but I can't play to the same strategies that you can, so my path through life will inheritantly be different. Therefore, I can't really take your advice.

Dharmasabitch,AnimalPorn,1389372871.0,"Technically, by the biological species concept, since these guys can interbreed with any wolf or coyote, they're all subspecies of the same canine species. Morphologically and behaviorally, I tend to agree they're effectively different, but any wolf or coyote is liable to interbreed with another at any given time, no matter how unlikely, because we know it's happened a lot before, and recently too. I wouldn't be surprised if Red Wolf DNA is somewhat conserved in a larger canine species, as they are extirpated and are forced to mate with incoming canines filling their niche, as we saw in the Northeast US. Indeed, the current opinion (although it changes annually with a new paper on their genetics) is that over the last several decades Red Wolves have interbred with Coyotes due to a lack of other mate choices, which is why their DNA contains Coyote haplotypes in micro-satellite regions. The overturned opinion from a 2010 or 2011 paper was that they (along with Eastern wolves) were hybrids of grey wolves and coyotes from an interbreeding event about 1000 years ago, so either way, this wolf is probably part coyote! I have to say, all the coywolves I've seen have looked much more like Red Wolves (almost identical) than coyotes."

MrQuizzles,gaybros,1389372926.0,"In my experience, living alone is expensive and generally not worth it. If a 1-bedroom apartment cost half as much as a 2-bedroom or a third as much as a 3-bedroom, sure, I'd go for it. That's just not how it pans out in reality, though. You're going to be paying a significant premium for the privilege of living alone. If you don't mind that, though, then whatever.

Get renter's insurance. It only costs about $100 for the year and can cover your ass for so much more if something goes wrong like if your stuff gets stolen or gets destroyed in a fire. It doesn't cover damages to the building or loss of your security deposit, just your stuff and general liability. Say you accidentally set the building on fire. Your insurance will cover the cost of your stuff and the cost of the lawsuit when your landlord decides to sue you over it to perhaps recover his insurance deductible and lost renting income.

Always read through the lease to see if there's any miscellaneous penalties or fees tacked on (like a late fee for rent). Keep a signed copy of the lease for your records. Check your state laws to see if it's legal to tack these fees on. If there is no fee schedule in your lease, then your landlord cannot legally demand any from you. I have seen landlords bilk unknowing renters out of money by making up fees not outlined in the lease.

You're definitely going to want a microwave to heat up leftovers and other miscellaneous things. I couldn't imagine life without one. A rice cooker is also a very handy tool when used creatively. A big enough pot/saucepan to accommodate pasta is suggested, as is a colander (because pasta is cheap and delicious). A small set of different-sized non-stick frying pans is always useful, and you're going to want a wooden spatula if you plan on cooking with them."

Don't worry, not taking it as such.

When I mean the alternative, I'm framing it as such:

Let's say that through some magical means we know the individual outcomes of a child's life from the moment of conception. We know that Adam is going to end up living a very poor life with very little happiness. Maybe he lives in fear from his father or is hungry more often than not - that can not be changed. This will presumably have long-lasting effects on his psyche.

The alternative here is that he does not lead any sort of life, he is instead aborted in the first trimester and is in a sense ""spared"" from such a life.

You can't guarantee the happiness of every person in existence. Some people live short, brutal lives, and while it's all well and good to say ""You just gotta chin up and things will get better"", they sometimes don't.

So I think we should let the mother decide because *she* knows if she's ready to take on that responsibility - not just in the personal sense of it but also economically as well."

Kelmurdoch,Eve,1389372986.0,"The purpose of the Archon to Chimera change is to alter the number of Omega Fleet Dreads needed to alpha the ship off the field. Omega fleet is the high-alpha (ironically) Naglfar design which con potentially one-shot an Archon at something like 150 dreads.

By the time I reached public high school, it was one less topic I had to worry about.  My peers were Muslim, Jewish, Mormon..  My first ever boyfriend at age 14 was an Atheist.  I was exposed to variety for the first time in my life.

bananas4anna,AskReddit,1389373108.0,"Many years ago, I was a camp counselor at a Ukrainian summer camp located here in the US. This camp was based on large Ukrainian owned and operated resort, and there was a Ukrainian Church on the resort property.

Anyway, the camp was of your typical summer camp with lots of outdoor activities coupled with Ukrainian culture and lessons in speaking Ukrainian. Most of the kids were American born to Ukrainian parents, some kids only half Ukrainian. One of the kids this one summer was biracial (his mother was African American, his father Ukrainian). Many older Ukrainians are a bit racist, so this was rare and he got stared at more than was polite. 

I was with a group of the campers, attending Church on a Sunday. Seated behind us this older guy who started muttering some awful things about the biracial boy, all in Ukrainian. I must have turned around at least 3 or 4 times to give him a dirty look, but he never got the clue. After the mass, as we were leaving, the boy looked right at the older guy, and in perfect Ukrainian, told him that he understood everything he had been saying. The look on the old guy's face was priceless. I was also super proud of how well this young boy handled himself.

 There was a farmer who grew watermelons. He was doing pretty well, but he was disturbed by some local kids who would sneak into his watermelon patch at night and eat his watermelons. After some careful thought, he came up with a clever idea that he thought would scare the kids away for sure. He made up a sign and posted it in the field. The next day, the kids show up and they saw the sign which read, ""Warning! One of the watermelons in this field has been injected with cyanide."" The kids ran off, made up their own sign and posted it next to the farmer's sign. When the farmer returned, he surveyed the field. He noticed that no watermelons are missing, but the sign next to his read, ""Now there are two!""

Agreeish with him on Fellaini but it's just silly to get rid of a 30mil signing who no one will pay half that for without giving him another season to prove his mettle.

bobmuluga,AskReddit,1389373331.0,"No you missed my point. My whole point was that a lot of people replace belief in themselves with god. Look at people in jail for example. A lot of them knew they did bad shit and want to get out. So they justify their actions with ""finding god"" and becoming a better person. It is a complete cop out since all they had to do in the first place was be a good person and they would have never been in that mess. It goes deeper, ""god wanted me to a learn a lesson"" no you were just a really shitty person that did shitty stuff. The other classic example are the people that find themselves in a really bad medical situation and end up finding god because they don't want to die. If god meant that much to you and god has an all knowing and mighty plan, don't you think you should accept your death as a gift? Just makes no sense. Just be a good person, be kind to people, and make good choices. Basically do everything ""god wants you to do"" but don't have any strings attached and do it for yourself and people around you."
p3ndulum,poker,1389373333.0,"What are you trying to accomplish with your 3-bet? - Are you 3-betting a tight player with a premium hand because you suspect there is a good chance that you have the best hand and don't mind playing a bloated pot while in position? Or are you 3-betting a loose player who is known for calling too many raises OOP and isn't very good at post-flop play and being able to read board texture or put their opponents on a hand?

Maybe you have a speculative hand like a suited gapper and are 3-betting as a misdirect/deceptive play with position against a tight player while deep stacked. 

Your reason for 3-betting should extend beyond the cards you're actually holding, otherwise you will become predictable and easily exploited.

Before you 3-bet you should be thinking about who you're 3-betting against and what you expect their response to be when faced with you 3-bet, as well as what your plan is to win the pot after the flop if you miss - including the best boards to continue on or the best boards to surrender on.

If the open came from a very aggressive player, you should probably look to flat in position with your speculative hands and raise with your premiums. But if the opener is a little more passive, you might consider inverting your 3-betting standards. Three-betting a more passive player with a speculative hand could win you quite a few small lots with weak holdings before you eventually connect with the board. Raising more aggressive opponents with these types of hands could get you blown off your hand.

If you stick to only 3-betting with premium hands, other players will be able to adjust very quickly and be able to play more correctly against you, setting you up to only win small pots with your premium starting hands - as your opponents will know exactly what they need to beat you, making it easy to fold and concede the small pot to your c-bet when they miss. But when they connect by flopping two-pair, sets, straights, etc, they'll win bigger pots off of you when you find it difficult to fold your hand in the face of a post-flop raise in a pot that you bloated before the flop.

It's important to take a moment before you enter any pot that you're deciding to play and consider all of the angles before putting chips in. You don't want to ever find yourself on autopilot - just limping in or flatting with your speculative hands and raising with your good ones - because not only will you become easier to play against, but you can miss the many opportunities that are there to ""play the man"" or ""play the board"" instead of just your own cards in a predictable, obvious and straight-forward manner."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389373352.0,"&gt; I can also understand why a girl would take the easy route of not making the actual move

But it's not taking the easy route, it's just doing things how they've always been done.  You seem to think girls are doing this because it's a cop out, but it has nothing to do with that.  It's just the way things are, like it or not.  For example, take a high school dance.  Ever hear of a Sadie Hawkins dance?  If not, it's where the girls ask the guys instead.  Why does this exist?  Because in nearly all cases, the guys ask the girls, and the girls wait to be asked, so it takes a specific dance to change that custom.  Nobody is taking the easy way out - they're just following along with the way things have always been done.  Guys are taught that they're supposed to ask girls out, and girls are taught that they're supposed to wait to be asked out.  It's not like every girl is thinking, ""well I *could* ask him out, but I'm afraid..."" it's more like ""I could ask him out, but I'm not supposed to.""  And anyway, do you really think waiting to be asked out is *easier*?  What if you never get asked?  Dude, *asking* is easier - if you get a no, you can ask someone else.

&gt;In the end, she's simply expecting the guy to make the move because she doesn't want to.

I think you're making assumptions here.  She feels like she's doing her part to show that she's interested, and if the guy is interested as well, he can ask.  And from the sounds of it, she *makes sure* that her intentions are clear.  It makes sense, too - both parties have specific jobs, and that's how she treats things when she goes out.  When she's interested, she makes sure it's known - if he feels the same, then he will respond accordingly.  It's just how things have been done, and to be honest, I'm far happier being the guy in this scenario than the girl.  I can make the call based on experience, I can ask her out whenever I want, and there's no waiting for something that might never happen, because I can either ask or move on, not just wonder if it will ever happen.  Plus, some guys won't react positively for the sole reason that a girl asked them out instead of vice versa, and I never have to deal with that.  

&gt;And from what I've heard, outfits and everything are chosen for themselves and not for guys. Which is also the response you'll get on here and on Askwomen.

Okay, and what does this change?  Why don't you ask them why they do that.  It's for themselves, okay, but why do they feel the need?  Because society forces them to feel the need.  That's why they have those stupid Dove commercials trying to show them they don't have to have model bodies to be attractive.  Did you honestly think that pressure didn't come from somewhere?

&gt;then why do women not simply make the move?

Like I said, because they don't think it's their job.  They think their job is to flirt pretty heavily to show interest.  To them, that *is* their move.  And this is changing - women are starting to ask guys out more than they used to.  But that's more for their benefit IMO.  They're asking guys out to take away the waiting and guesswork (same reason we do it).  I honestly don't even care if this changes, because I already feel like I have the advantage by being able to ask whoever out that I want.  No waiting games.

&gt;And why do shy people tend to rely on the exact signals women use and not ask them out directly? 

I'm not sure what you're asking, but I'm inclined to say ""because they're shy.""

&gt;Why do we use hints like this if we don't want to say something oturight?

Hints like what?  I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

&gt;hinting is ridiculously easy and the ""rejection"" by ignoring of a hint isn't as clear-cut and final as the one you get if someone directly tells you that you are being rejected.

Sorry, I was about to respond, but you have to clarify this as well, I'm just confusing myself trying to figure it out.

But to give a little more clarification in case it helps, I've flirted with girls and clearly been ignored or had things said that showed that the flirting was not reciprocated and that she wasn't interested.  This felt the exact same to me as asking a girl out and her saying no.  It's never that bad, but people think it's this big scary thing.  Maybe people have had some pretty bad reactions from a girl, but then those aren't the girls you want to ask out anyway.  What's funny is you know what actually felt worse than being turned down for a date?  A girl I was interested in telling me that I was like a brother.  But still, I don't think one is worse than the other.  Rejection is rejection.  And plus, if someone isn't responding to flirting whatsoever, it's pretty clear-cut and final.  Sure, there are some instances where that might not be the case, but the vast majority of the time, it's a safe bet, so I don't really see there being a difference.

&gt;But from my experience, those pressure don't only apply to women. 

I didn't mean to say that it only applied to women and not to men, I mean't not *really* to men.  Yeah, we get some of that stuff, I don't disagree with that, but it's not to the same extent at all, not even close.  To say that things are equal in that regard is incredibly naive.  Go ask a single girl the last time she felt the need to try to look perfect.  Then ask the same thing of a single guy, and when he says ""never,"" ask if he knows what that even means (and yes, there are exceptions, I realize this, no reason to get nitpicky)."

Neopopulas,dayz,1389373505.0,"I guess, for me, i separate the 'in game' qualify of life, versus the 'meta' quality. I'm TOTALLY for things like food, exhaustion and weather. Maps being hard to read, cities being confusing, the landscape large and mostly unpopulated.

I'm absolutely all about the gloom and the confusion, those a realistic things, they exist, and they should. I for one would like them to change the clouds so they are locked on, just like you can't turn the grass off. So people can't run around at night in gray scale without any trouble.

For me though, its the artificial complexity, its the 'we're making this harder than it needs to be because fuck you thats why', i get having a hard time, i get it being difficult, tense and scary even.

But like, for example, guns have an artificial dispersion (apparently), there is NOTHING you can do about that, numbers say this shot will not go where the crosshairs are, so screw you.

That, to me, is very ham fisted, its not difficult, its arbitrary. For me, its fun when its a challenge, when its something that you work against, but that doesn't do that.

At the moment, it can be physically impossible to recognize your friends because the game does (and likely always will) just simply lack the ability to portray players in a way that would give you the subtle clues you need, that doesn't strike me as grim or gritty or hard, its just another mechanic that makes things artificially difficult.

I'm all for things being hard, but i guess i don't like things being difficult just for the sake of them being difficult for no reason, they don't need to, and don't even make that much sense to be, unlike hunger, or maps, or darkness.

afropunk3,AdviceAnimals,1389373542.0,"I read the study that /u/danceIwill linked to; the results of the research from the University of Chicago on race preferences in dating really are fascinating.

The quick answer to your question is no; the longer answer will take much more time to lay out. In essence, the study seems to illustrate that race preferences in dating remain significant even among very liberal white individuals with high levels of education. The study heavily implies that these preferences are influenced by the neighborhoods that the white participants grew up in (believe it or not, but the more diverse the neighborhood, the less likely that the white participant will want to date outside of their race) and by the overall racial climate of their area (specifically, respondents from Southern states were much less likely to say that they had dated outside of their race). And, to circle back to your question, I think that it is safe to answer with ""no"" because of the nature of the study's experiment; specifically, the study focused on the racial dynamics of speed-dating (and not on the formation of long-term relationships). However, you will never get the chance to worry about things such as what your mixed race children will look like if you do not wish to wish consider a person of a different race as a potential dating partner in a very short-term experiment (like this one); therefore, it is safe to say that the speed-daters (and many online daters) aren't consciously excluding people of other races (more accurately, their unconscious biases are serving to perform the exclusion for them).

lamblikeawolf,short,1389373591.0,"Well, I do know that he was in the military (the Navy, I think, but I am not 100% sure) and now that he is retired from duty he has a cushy job at the post office with a lot of benefits. And I also know that my mom, his friends, and their girlfriends used to have ridiculous adventures when they were all in town. Like when she told me they all went out drinking and one of the guys just picked up a road construction thing (like [this](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/road-sign-cone-easel-signs-white-background-31824109.jpg)) and they couldn't get the stupid light on the top to stop flashing all night. 

Or how when she and he drove from Connecticut to Colorado to move there, they managed to pick up a couple of stray kittens along the way. But the thing was, they weren't allowed to take the cats in with them to the places they stayed along the way, so they smuggled in the kittens in their coat pockets. This story always gets to me, because my dad never allowed us to have pets, claiming he was allergic. (While the person he left my mom for had a dog, and when that dog died, they got a new dog. I'm told by my brother that he is currently looking into getting a second dog at the same time.) So to think of my mom as an animal person in a similar way that I am is unusual, because it's never something I ever got to see in her.

Or how my mom always talks about one of the things she missed was going dancing. My dad never went dancing, and my sister's dad was always on something, or working too many hours to go.

&gt;he, if given the chance, would have chosen his current height or rather to be taller or to be shorter?

I don't know. I won't pretend to know how he feels about it. It really didn't come up too much. We were too busy having a great time catching up.

&gt;Do you think his life would have been better romantically and professionally if he were shorter or if he were taller? Do you think he is conscious of this? While your mother wasn't limited in her options of mates by her height, her short mexican ex-husband was very limited by the man-must-be-taller norm.

I'm pretty sure the latent racism at the time was a much bigger concern to him. I mean, really, a Mexican with a white woman in the late 60's, early 70s? In New England? A MIXED RACE MARRIAGE?! I think his race and people's notions about race excluded him from many more potential mates than his height did. And I think if you were to ask him if he could change his race that he would be disgusted at the idea. Height can be just as much of an inherent part of your identity as race.

&gt;It seems to be analogous to an obese woman celebrating her body size.

So... if I'm happy about my height, I am just ""settling"" for a ""less than optimal"" body? Even though there is nothing I can do to change it and there never will be? So I should be angry about it all the time? I should go around cursing genetics for giving me a proportionally higher number of short genes than either of my parents had? I should bemoan the fact that the world simply isn't made for my height? I don't think so.

I can't pretend to know what it is like to be rejected over and over again for something outside of your control. I don't even really know what it's like to be rejected over and over again - until recently I had been with the same guy for six years since highschool. Maybe in several months, once I've had some more experience with that, I'll let you know. 

And I expect to have plenty of experience with that. I don't drink - I don't mind if other people drink, but not if they have a problem with alcohol. I'm an introvert. I don't like make-up. I don't believe in primping the hell out of myself to interact with people. I play ~~videogames~~ pokémon and read a lot. While reddit seems to think a lot of those traits are positives, the outside world largely doesn't. I'm not blonde - that immediately eliminates a lot of people from even caring to talk to me. I'm not some long-legged model. In fact, I often joke that all of the shortness in in my legs. I'm the same height as anyone else sitting down, and taller than my brother sitting down as well. So there goes anyone that had their sights set on that. 

My point being, there are always going to be these kinds of obstacles over factors that don't make any sense, and are kind of douchey things to be picky about. But I won't begrudge anyone their preferences, even if it means I get told no a thousand times over. I'm not going to suddenly start putting on make-up and blow-drying and curling my hair to try to ""increase my odds."" Because that isn't me. The more people eliminate and judge me on superficial factors, the faster it is that I can cut through their BS and stop considering them. And in the long run, I don't care how many guys I dated over my life. I'm only going to end up with one anyway."

mikachuu,AskReddit,1389373611.0,"I was born into a religious family, Christian.  One half Assembly of God, the other Disciples of Christ.  I didn't like either of them.  But I was devout and I would defend my beliefs and faith to anyone, even if it was feeble at the time.  There was a point in my life where I went to church every day of the week.  A lot of that was because my father was a pastor.  

Sunday morning: Breakfast in the Congregational Hall, Sunday school at 9:45, the Sunday Service.  Youth group meetings afterwards.

Monday:  Usually empty, but substituted with groups sometimes.

Tuesday:  Bells Practice

Wednesday:  Bible Study

Thursday:  Choir Practice

Friday:  Youth group/lock ins/etc.

Saturday:  Band practice/sunday preparations.

And that's not counting the fundraisers, revivals, play practices, VBS weeks, and any other special meetings/groups.  It was basically insane.  But I kept up with it because it was expected of me to.  

My 'loss of religion' didn't just come out of nowhere.  It was very gradual, over the past 10 years of my life.  I remember when I was a teen I told myself that I would never be a 'C &amp; E church goer'.  And now here I am, and I haven't attended in 3 years.  My bible is sitting in a cardboard box.  And most of all, I don't give two shits about God or going to Hell or anything like that.  Even if I went to Heaven, or if there is one... I just don't care.

I think the pressure of expectations broke me.  It all seems so obvious now, especially writing this.  But it wears on you.  The pressures of having to have a good image, of overhearing little blue-haired ladies talk behind your back about how sweet and gentle you are, but they saw you playing cards in the church hall, so something's 'not right' with you.  (and I'm not even talking MtG, I'm saying a regular 52 deck).  

It used to tear me apart so much, having to endure church even once every couple of months, just so when my grandmother would call, I could tell her that I was 'consistently going'.  I couldn't stand the guilt.  Finally I decided that enough was enough and I meditated.

""There is no guilt.""  I said it over and over to myself, and it didn't take long.  I was able to breathe better and felt better, lighter.  And that's when I told my family that I was not a believer anymore.  They took it well enough.  It's really fucked up how I can have an epiphany over 4 words and my life is better for it.  

I'm only 26.  For all I know, I could switch back in another 10 years.  It's entirely possible.  I just don't plan on doing it."

joeph1sh,bengals,1389373761.0,"He used to specialize in the back end of the defense more than the front.  Old secondary coach in multiple locations, however our defense is more known for the concepts, so he isn't really a positional guy.  Our front seven is your traditional over concept, where the SAM, RDE, and RDT mainly focus on getting downhill and creating hesitation so that the MLB and WILL can come in and clean up the slops that the right side leaves for them, supposing they haven't been stopped already.  The weakside has a focus on eating space and often gets help from the secondary when plays swing out toward that side.  Safeties are interchangeable and should be physical.  Corners will mainly focus on technique and will draw a lot of deep coverage assignments.  Under practically no circumstances are the corners allowed to let someone go overtop of them.

With that said, he doesn't fit your current personnel all that well and you should seriously consider someone else.  I'd love for the guy to get a HC job, but I want it to be somewhere where he wouldn't have to rebuild the defense and possibly take our players with him.  I bet he'd take Newman, probably try to get Michael Johnson as well, Adam Jones would follow him in a heart beat i bet too.  And that's if you don't take our LB coach to be his DC as well.

Cap_Had,magicTCG,1389373852.0,"Arrest and Pacifism are similar cards. The difference is that for one more mana, Arrest also stops activated abilities, which are anything of the form ""cost : effect."" It would stop Erebos' card drawing ability, but it wouldn't do anything about the anti-lifegain ability. If you're worried about Erebos, you could put in a couple Fade into Antiquity. That's probably the best way to deal with the gods in standard; cards that say ""destroy"" won't have any effect on them because they're indestructible, but exiling doesn't care about indestructibility.

Yoked Ox, Zarichi Tiger, Angelic Wall, Soulmender, Guardians of Meletis, and Setessan Battle Priest could all be taken out. I don't think you have enough cards that target your creatures to make good use of the Battle Priest. I would also switch out the Lagonna-Band Elders for more Centaur Healers, since you get slightly higher stats and more consistency for the same amount of mana.

As for your maybeboard, Advent of the Wurm, Ajani, and Archangel of Thune are all powerful cards that could work in your deck. When looking for what to take out for them, I'd try to identify which cards you find have the smallest impact on your games. You want each card in your deck to help you win, and there are a few like the ones I mentioned above which really don't do a whole lot beyond chump-blocking.

Here are a few other cards I'd recommend looking at:

* Serra Angel - She's just a good threat late in the game. Flying and Vigilance work well together. Archangel of Thune is better in most ways, but this is a decent alternative (especially since it's a much cheaper card in terms of money).
* Selesnya Charm - All of the modes of this card are useful. It's kind of hard to go wrong with it.
* Trostani, Selesnya's Voice - This is a good card in general that works very well with things that create tokens like Advent of the Wurm. If you put her in, also add more things that make tokens like Selesnya Charm, and maybe Call of the Conclave or Armada Wurm."

I'm sick of other men assuming that childcare does not apply to them.

Now for my suggestions on tricks that helped us.

What saved us sometimes was buying a baby swing...the swing rocked the baby to sleep when we were too exhausted to do so.  Generally they aren't recommended as an 'always' solution, but they saved us now and then.  I even performed a few swing to crib transfers, though it's difficult.  We got one for 20 bucks at consignment.

Also, I strongly recommend really really loud white noise.  Like can't hear people in the next room talking loud.  Get an app for your phone, or buy an industrial fan.  This can help soothe baby.

Stay strong...each week was easier and easier for us.  And I hope that you have enough respect from your partner that you can sit him down and tell him what you need and he will give it to you."

Because you're not framing it as opinion, you're framing it as a fact. Saying things such as:

is just not accurate. Police have been found guilty of being unjustified and unlawful in the past, so to suggest that the investigator always find it to be justified is just not the case.

Honestly though, I believe you cherry picked your chosen definition of murder. Not only is not the first to come up in a search, but it is not the way most people - nor most legal systems - define murder.

Five minutes to the bell.

It took me a while to set this all up.  Had to watch the janitors and the technicians.  Had to keep an eye on the security guards' movements and rotations.  It wasn't hard.  I analyze everything.  It didn't take much...just a lot of time.

Four minutes to the bell.

Through the door, head down, straight to class.  Same as always.  Avoid their glances, avoid their stares.  Don't speak, just walk.  Funny, I kinda like talking.  Enjoy it very much.  They just never wanted to hear it.

Three minutes to the bell.

I was sure I would find friends among the nerd crowd.  ""My own kind,"" if you will.  I was wrong.  They were even worse.  None of them wanted to think.  None of them wanted to discuss every detail or look deeper to the story.  No one wanted to hear, ""This is bad,"" or, ""This could be better.""  They only wanted praise.  So the analyze was pushed aside.  Again.

Two minutes to the bell.

You know the one thing I learned in high school?  There is no happiness.  It's an illusion.  Nothing is going to get better, and nothing will ever be good.  Friends will betray you, people will make incredible mistakes, and no one will pause to think.

One minute to the bell.

There's my first classroom.  The first is there.  The pistol in my hoodie's inner pocket suddenly feels a lot heavier.  I check my watch again, carefully synchronized to the ringer.  The smoke bombs wired into the system won't hurt anyone.  They'll just make some chaos.  Chaos I can use.  One quick, suppressed shot to the back.

afropunk3,AdviceAnimals,1389373981.0,"Fun fact: according to research done about stress and interracial dating, Asian males who have black girlfriends seem to experience the most stress out of all known gender/racial pairings.

This is likely due to the fact that the Asian male/black female pairing is literally the rarest out of all interracial relationships; black/Asian relationships are already extremely uncommon (annually, they account for less than 1% of all marriages in the US), but most of those relationships are of the black male/Asian female variety.

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1389373992.0,"&gt; how reliant she seems to be on me...I care for her like a parent would at this point

I am not saying that the two of you can't be happy, or that things are, or even should be over at this point. But remember that a romance isn't a caretaker relationship. A good romance that develops into love starts with two people who are equals and complement each other. They both bring things to the table and if at this early a stage one of you feels like they need to take care of the other like a parent, that's a sign that things aren't equal. You can love someone like that, but I don't believe in being in a romance so you can be someone's caretaker, I believe in being with them because they make your life better too, and can take care of you if you need it. If you can't both take care of each other then when times come when you need to be taken care of you will in a sense still be on your own.

Ultimately what you should do is follow your heart. Keep our advice in your mind as you go, and figure out what applies and what doesn't. Use our advice like a condom. It isn't there to stop you from having sex, it is there to protect you when you do. You need to make some mistakes and you need to learn from them, but hopefully knowing what some of us who have been there before see as warning signs lets you know what to keep an eye on so you see where problems might come up and are ready if they do, not surprised and trapped.

You have a lot of potential, you have only been alive less than a 5th of your lifetime. It is time to be learning and expecting to make some mistakes, and that's ok. If you start thinking about making certain decisions in terms of how they will permanently affect your life forever, then be very careful.

If you chase this girl, make sure that she is what you are really chasing, and not just a relationship, or forgiveness."

almightybob1,AskReddit,1389374179.0,"&gt; I loved *[Catholics']* teachings on self awareness, morality, and ethics

Including their attitude to the morality and ethics of homosexuality?

&gt; All religions have something good to say about ethics and morality, and all actually have a same or similar goal, so I don't really choose one over another.

Most religions require that you do not pick and choose your favourite bits from them. For example, it is the First Commandment (unless you are Jewish, in which case it is part of the Second Commandment). See Exodus 20:3 and Deuteronomy 5:7."

My dad worked (and still does) for the IOE (International Organisation of Employers) and defended the rights of employers. 

The meeting was about a week long, and the 2 had both noticed each other. However, my dad was not making a move and my mother did not know why. Her colleague then suggested that it may be because the chairman of the meeting was constantly referring to her at Mrs. King instead of Ms. King. 

So on the last day of the meeting, when there were very few people left in the room (including my dad), she walked to the chairman and told him that she was actually Ms. King. This immediately got my dad's attention and they both went for coffee/dinner.

My mother went back to the Philippines to continue working and my dad stayed in Geneva. They wrote to each other a lot, then my mother flew to Geneva for 2 weeks, then a few months late my dad went to the Philippines for 2 weeks, then they got married at around 38."

I don't have big breasts but did have them for a short time after giving birth, I got up to about 30HH I think, and was 5'0"" and 115lbs. Yes, they were huge, but they didn't look like they went against nature either, especially considering I was breastfeeding.

Also, fake boobs don't necessarily have to have a ""toilet plunger shape"". It depends on the surgeon, how much tissue you had beforehand(if you are a 32A and then suddenly go to 32K, yes, they're going to look weird. Many women do it gradually so the tissue has got time to expand). You can *ask* your surgeon to make your boobs as close to your neck and fake as possible, or you can ask him/her to make them look more natural. 'Real' boobs aren't all like teardrops, either. Again, my mom has huge breasts and they're perky as hell, and she's 43. So have all my aunts and my grandma, and not one of them has gotten surgery.

Sister's aunt got breast augmentation surgery, she absolutely adores her boobs. It's a shame this woman doesn't because of a shithead man that forced her into getting this surgery when she was younger and now thinks that big fake boobs make you a slut."

Edit: Flight paths are not determined by the shortest distance between two points.  There are other factors.  For example if you wanted to drive from your house to the grocery store and you took out a map and compass and figured out what heading was a direct line to the store.  Then you put the pedal down and drove straight into a house, river, or other challenge.  It is much faster to follow the set roads.

again, i'm not trying to say race has no part in this. what i'm saying is that the financial situation is FAR MORE culpable for these types of statistics. you can argue that it is because of the history of oppression that has kept the high proportion of black people in poverty. all i'm trying to say is that in 2014 the people overwhelmingly getting arrested are poor and those poor people (due to historical legislation) are predominantly black (at least in cities where drug arrest rates are obviously much higher)"

I'm only a bartender, but I'm working 40+ hours a week and still going out every night. I don't really get where you're going with this post, do you want us to tell you that you have to pick between one or the other? Because we won't.

I need more detail on what you mean by ""Because we won't"". It's a respectable assertion, but I don't know how that manifests as action. If you're working all day and partying all night, you'll lose sleep. If you lose enough sleep, it affects your health, and possibly make you perform worse at your job. There's only 24 hours in a day, and you haven't given me any information on how you're using them.

&gt; You say you want counter examples, I don't know how to help you there if you're in a small city with probably not very many pua friends. If you really want, join on the the big cities groupmes and ask around, pretty much every guy I know in the community has a normal job.

I'm not interested in a ""normal"" job. I want a top 20% or even top 10% job. I'm not even interested in picking up women at this point in my life. The problem is that most men I know don't believe they can get a top 20% job, so they decide to do something ""normal"" and pick up women with their spare time."

Then we'll have the problems of aging populations, and if we follow suit with china, a loss of personal freedom, possible violations of bodily rights, and massive sex differences. Not necessarily a good idea.

&gt;Just from the practical standpoint of allowing people a chance to feel like they contribute and aren't superfluous. 

Or maybe we need to get away from this contribution mindset, especially with low skill work. I mean, I can see what people mean by contributing if they're doctors or politicians or something like that, but I don't see the low wage jobs being eliminated as being particularly fulfilling.

&gt;How about this as a humane solution? Pay people a decent amount to not have children? Take care of them for the rest of their lives. If the wealthy want the world to themselves, that's certainly preferable to letting everyone kill each other and starve. It's the least they can do, ethically. 

While I'd love this as someone who is childfree myself, not really a good idea. Could raise ethical concerns, especially if someone gets pregnant by accident and is opposed to abortion, then you're making them choose between their morals and their well being. Doesn't sit well with me.

My UBI plan doesnt cover children tho, personally, and I pretty much assume that if you have kids, you're on your own. I guess that's a little better.

&gt;I think a post scarcity society, like Star Trek or something, won't be feasible without managing the herd in some way. Are there slums on Earth on Star Trek? How did Picards family end up with that vineyard? Who gets the good land? There must be far fewer people... 

Or a lot of planets that are colonized. Anyway, post industrial societies naturally have lower birth rates. US isn't affected mainly because of a large immigrant influx raising our population, but a lot of other countries without an influx of immigrants are having population decline."

I heard this scratching sound coming from another room and got up and, sure enough, our dog was walking over our slick hardwood floor to come to my sisters' rescue. She had to walk up about a dozen steep steps just to make it upstairs. I thought it was really heroic that she sensed the stress and tried to save us in her poor physical condition and old age.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389374538.0,"Make some friends, dude!  If you're in school, you should have other friends around as well.  This is why it's always a good idea to have more than one friend (what if they leave), or even more than one circle of friends.  If one circle is having issues, you can always go to the other.  Use this time to meet new people and develop some great friendships.  In a breakup, having friends around makes everything so much better.  You won't dwell on things as much and overall, you'll be in a better mood.

I also recommend breaking contact for a while, at least as best as possible.  If she wants to talk, you can tell her you don't mind talking if she wants to clear things up or whatever, but you can also tell her that afterward, you need some time to sort things out and get over everything, and you need maybe a month or two apart to get over how you feel (someone suggested 90 days - I think that's overkill.  You may even be good in a few weeks, but to each his own, decide for yourself what feels right).  At that point, friendship is *way* easier.  Cutting contact doesn't have to mean the friendship is over.  Think about if you were at home and your parents pissed you off.  You can leave the house and maybe stay at a friend's place, and then once you cool off, you go back home and everything is cool.  That's all you need to do - get yourself back to normal, be happy with being single, accept the fact that things are over, and allow yourself to move on.   Once you do that, you can try being friends again.

Also, don't worry too much about the reasons she gave, as they aren't always 100% truthful.  Just look at the relationship, what went wrong, what you could have done better or differently, **learn from that** and move on."

I've never done ayahuasca or DMT, but if it takes your mind entirely away from the physical world around you as people say it does, that's kind of ""spiritual"". In the sense that you're experiencing the separation of sensation and stimulus, which from the perspective of the person tripping is the separation of mind and body. Or some other hippie bullshit.

GekkostatesOfAmerica,AskReddit,1389374596.0,"So I'm a tad bit late but I'm gonna try and make the best of this:

I was raised in a Catholic family that was very liberal in terms of modern education: we believe in evolution, the Earth wasn't made in 7 days, etc. my family accepted people of all different faiths in our community and accepted their choices for their own, even if they weren't religious. 

That being said, I am religious when it comes to things that even science has trouble explaining:

Of all animals that are evolving on Earth, why did we become more intelligent? We aren't the oldest mammals, or the only ones that live in communities, follow sets of rules, or mourn our dead. Why us?

What is life for? Are we to live and love and hate and fight just so we can be buried, forgotten? I feel like there should be more here, and science doesn't offer any other answer other than ""There is nothing after death,"" or ""Science can't tell us that.""

And perhaps what keeps a lot of us up at night on those depressing evenings; what happens after the universe ends? Is our fate to decompose into atoms that will soar through the universe for all eternity when all the light has gone? If so, what is the point? Is the universe just a purposeless bubble in the eternity that is existence?

These questions can't be answered by science, or at least can't yet. And yet these questions scare me, so I turn to God for the answers. No I don't follow the Bible or go to Church, but I know that treating people how you want to be treated is the right thing to do, and the idea was first made popular by Jesus. My faith lies in the idea that, after following this teaching, and wondering these questions for our whole lives, we can rest in peace. True peace. In a place where there is no worry, no pain, no horror. And yet we still ARE. We still FEEL. We still LIVE. That's why I am religious."

lilburrito,Entrepreneur,1389374606.0,"Hmm, I can't confirm if they are making sales this way, but they're definitely getting some page interaction - only a few hundred out of their hundreds of thousands of likes. And their audience is different than yours, too.

I'm thinking if you really want to get traffic on Facebook, those random, shareable ""viral"" photos would be the best chance if your target audience is the type of folks who constantly share ""inspirational quotes"" and ""funny stuff."" But the audience who loves to share those random viral images are moms and tweens, when you're targeting aspiring writers.

You'll have to experiment, this product you link to on your page that converts manuscripts to kindle? Is that your product? Writers, the type of people who have the money and need for your product, probably won't like memes and simple images. 

If I were you, I would write or hire a writer to create high-quality articles about self-publishing, writing one's first book, because that would probably get you closer to the customers you're looking for. 

I suggest looking at pages very similar to yours, pages for writers, instead of pages like The Hippy Bloggers, which is a bit too different for you to get similar results by replicating their techniques. You can even team up with them, ask the page owners to help spread your content, or even promote that product for you, if for a fee.

Tuala08,AskMen,1389374615.0,"I never really understood where these expectations come from? Sure there are a few women who want these things in a man but not many. Here is my take:

I want someone who is passionate about what they do and puts lots of effort into it regardless of money.  I don't care how much someone makes as long as they live within their means.  My only hope above that is that a guy has enough money to partake in some entertainment, I am very frugal but I do like to travel and take fun classes and it would be fun to have someone to join in.

Women want the size penis that fits with their body.  For some women that is smaller than average, for some it's larger and it can be determined by your anatomy, how much sex you have, and if you have had babies.  Personally it drives me crazy when the guys I date start moaning about wanting a bigger dick when I have actually bled due to the size.  Bigger is not always better. 

I look for a guy with less experience, I do not want to be with someone who sleeps around. People have the right to do what they want, but I want to be with someone who is discerning in their partners, including their first.  I didn't lose my virginity until my 3rd year university.

I don't think any woman expects a man to pleasure her properly with no instruction. Every woman is different so you have learn what this individual likes.  The last guy I dated had slept with 27 women and to be honest I was rather repulsed. I tried to get over it though and not judge him for his past. But then he went on and on about how good he was at sex, however he was a 'giver' and so in tune with women that I will surely be blown away.  He was so over confident he wouldn't let me give any suggestions and honestly the few things we did were so terrible and boring I didn't even sleep with him.

If a man tries to act dominant to me all the time, I end up wanting to punch them in the face. 

Do men really think all women are so fickle and cruel?  A lot of women are extremely loyal, would never cheat and even stay in bad relationships because of their commitment. 

I see no reason why men have to have these unrealistic expectations of themselves and others... most women do not expect these things and I think the ones that do deserve the men who expect them to be arm candy. "

rm999,statistics,1389374625.0,"Validation is a tool used during modeling, and the way it's applied depends on a lot of factors including the size of your dataset and the algorithm you are using. In other words, one piece of advice can't fit all situations, you have to think hard about why you make your decisions. Unlike the test/train split, the train/validation split is one you can vary and play with during your modeling process to optimize your final model. 

The most basic rule is the more training data, the better. With large datasets my rule of thumb is to create the smallest validation set that is big enough to get statistically significant results; you don't want insignificant changes drastically affecting the results on your validation. A typical value used here is 20-40%, but I prefer to come up with a reasonable value based on my situation instead of using a rule of thumb. Cross validation is a great way to go if you find your validation set takes up too much training data, but cross validation won't let you build a final model because it creates many smaller models. For the final model you either want to fix all your hyperparameters and use all the training data for training, or keep a holdout validation set to determine the best model (for example, if you need to determine where to stop gradient descent).

I'm irreligious because it makes me happy. I was raised christian and spent a lot of time dwelling on the words of pastors and the bible specifically 

Revelation 3:16 [NIV]

Basically made me always want to be a better believer, so I would try to keep my faith in god and pray to him, but it also made me feel great shame in myself whenever I sinned. Whenever I masturbated I felt deep shame, and I would pray for forgiveness and make new years resolutions to never do so again. They never stuck, and it ate at me and ultimately helped lead to my being (more) depressed.

When I finally stopped believing that there was a God, I felt immensely happy, I did the whole new atheist on Reddit thing where I read up on atheism constantly. That phase has mostly settled, but I am still opposed to the spread of religion, because of the worst it brings out in people. "

At what point in the act of prostitution is there consent involved, especially for the victim? You seem to think that there's an element of choice...

Let me ask you this: why aren't you a prostitute? Better yet, if I were to give you $1,000,000 a year to be sold, daily, to men, would you take that job? Remember, these men (I say men because women make up a very small percentage of the population that actually purchases prostitutes) would own you for the allotted time. 1 hour, 2 hours, whatever. I'm going to assume that you wouldn't want to do that. Why not? Because you probably don't want to be sexually objectified. You probably have MUCH better things going on right now, such as education, or a job.

So where is this ""choice"" you speak of? I would be willing to bet that women who walk the street didn't go to Harvard. They probably never even went to college. In fact, I'd be willing to bet, even more, that most street walkers have been deprived of a normal upbringing, one that you may have had. I bet that they had either absent parents, drug addicted parents, or parents that didn't care for them. How much do you wanna bet that no street walker had above a 3.6 GPA in high school?

You have to believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins and through him, you can enter Heavan. I believe that.  And I also follow the values set by him such as never judging others and making sure that you treat everyone in love, and never hate.  
           Denomiations and over-traditionalism especially in the Catholic and Orthodox churches have ruined and diluted Christ into a figure to worship instead of someone to follow.

Hardware wise, try all sorts of new things to find out what you like. I once bought a pair of extremely fuzzy gloves to give lightshows and it was awesome, They were an extra diffuser, and were incredibly soft. They only lasted one or two events before getting completely soiled and gross though. I've stuck those flexible cheapo glowsticks in the back of my gloves down my fingers and it added a creepy effect like you could see my bones glowing without compromising my flexibility. 

Technique wise there are many things you can do to be unique. The most obvious and memorable part of your shows can be your signature move. Something you can come back to at whatever time you think it fits. Maybe just at the beginning and end of your show. Maybe every time there is a big drop. People will remember your show by your signature move. 

When you're giving your show, don't just think about what you are doing with your hands, think about your whole body. What are your arms doing? Many of the moves I use in my shows have become easier and I could build off them more once I learned to move my elbows and arms around. Are you moving? People like when things get interesting, keep changing distances from everything. How close is your show to your audience? How close is your show to the ground? How close is your show to you? What is your energy level like? In most shows I see the glover very focused on his/her show but in most cases they don't change their energy to match with the music. If things are getting intense try to use your energy and expression to look like your gloveshow is a magical beast that you are trying to tame. If everyone around you is having fun, you should be too. Try to laugh and smile during your show unless you are going for the creepy serious look. 

Try to think of your show as if It is located on a plane. Not an airplane but an imaginary plane of existence. Move your show from plane to plane for some excitement. Then take your planes and tilt them. Do a part of your normal show but sideways. Tilt the plane all the way back so you are doing your show almost upside down if that makes sense. Try having each hand on a different plane.

FactualPedanticReply,gaming,1389374855.0,"ehhhh, if I recall correctly from the 3.5 Draconomicon, it's not impossible for any dragon species to reach the Great Wyrm age category - it's just reasonably unlikely. Whites, for example, have a four to six point Intelligence discrepancy between them and the Reds in all age and size categories. With them being that much stupider at all ages, it's not tough to believe they don't survive that long. Moreover, a Great Wyrm White only has 20 INT; a level one adventurer of the right races could match wits evenly. 

As for the size thing, the [Monster Manual](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dragonTrue.htm#) entry is a little contradictory. The text describes Great Wyrms as being over 100 ft. long, but the combat rules show them as being only ""Colossal"" and taking up a 30 ft square.

With that said, any policy a President wants to enact must be approved by the other houses of government (Senate and Congress) so I don't think they would rescind on legislation that already passed.

jensenj2,AskReddit,1389374893.0,"Being a 'devout follower' of a religion basically puts you into one of two categories: hypocrite or moron.

If you're in the latter section, you'll just mindlessly accept all of the contrived rubbish that's spoon-fed to you. Believe that Earth is only 10,000 years old. Believe stories about dead bodies coming back to life and talking snakes, take your pick. It's all okay, because you're a **believer** now. You'll be welcomed with open arms when you die.

If you're not a moron, then you'll fall into the former section. In this case, your brain is functional enough to figure out that **some** of the bullshit that your respective religion is trying to feed to you. You're clever enough to work out that the dead can't come back to life, and that the Earth is a lot older than 10,000 years. So, you don't swallow *all* of the crap, but you're still a devout follower of the religion. AKA hypocrite. 90% of the time, this will be because you were 'brought up' that way. Indoctrinated.

And that's the market that Valve should be targeting. I just posted this same point on the thread you linked. The batch of Steam machines that were recently released are basically a mess. 13 different boxes with different specs are gong to be confusing to console gamers, it's not going to make them switch.

And it would still have all the advantages you listed above.

Tavarish,Games,1389375026.0,"It's rather new thing in WoW and Blizzard has been vocal about that they wont wave monthly fees anytime soon if never during games rest lifespan. This is for game that has been extremely successful and popular since release of Vanilla. They have that base and they have that Magic Sauce that keeps players playing.

This is why I don't see in-game store changing that much for WoW, but maybe increase sales of mounts etc. as they come directly to client now.

Then we have TESO.

 Game about which we really haven't heard anything good about from testers, company isn't generating hype for it and published material looks, lets be honest here, like it's from 2007. Game that will have larger than usual price tag, monthly fee and straight from the bat in-game store for purchases.

With games like The Secret World we should have learned that combination of those three [Purchase + Fee + In-game store] things is red flag, plan to fall on to if base doesn't grow into X players. TSW is technically sound game, but its designs and theme are out there which didn't get mass attention forcing F2P transition to become sustainable.

So what this can mean to TESO that is, based on heard, years behind in design curve, has most awkward MMO combat ever created and dead world with next to no meaningful interactions? To me it's red flag that they try and want hook *HC* ES fans into TESO for Y months, after initial buying, and after players starts to drop out make F2P transition. 

While bolstering in-game store with vanity transmog items, pets etc.

Don't get me wrong. I don't wish TESO to be utter failure and flop, but all heard from testers combined with how little developers actually has shown and told don't breath confidence into me."

sturdyliver,Catholicism,1389375039.0,"Cry rooms are rooms built specifically for mothers with young children so that the children can scream all they want without anyone in the church being distracted. As the oldest child in a large family, I spent a lot of time in one growing up. Usually they have speakers and glass in the front so that people in the cry room can still follow what is going on at the altar. I've seen them with curtains so that they can cover the front glass and double as a bridal room for weddings. I don't know when they first came along, but a lot of modern churches have them.

A lot of criticism of cry rooms comes from the fact that they effectively remove mothers and babies from worship by separating them from the rest of the congregation. In a lot of parishes with cry rooms, people look at you dirty when your baby screams in the pews rather than recognizing the gift of life. Also, I can tell you that the difference in behavior of a child inside versus outside the cry room is night and day. In the cry room, I would bring toys and not pay attention to anything going on in Mass, while in the pews, I knew I'd better behave and at least *act* like I'm paying attention. Cry rooms instill the Mass-as-entertainment idea into us at an early age."

My opinion? What she's doing is just as selfish as if you were to decide never to meet any of her friends ever again. Firstly, these are dates, they should be just the two of you otherwise they aren't called dates. Secondly she shouldn't be forcing you into interactions she knows make you uncomfortable. 

She obviously has the opinion of many people here: get over it. It's not something you get over, it's something that's a part of you and you learn to work with. Being around these people is draining, it's always going to be draining. You need to learn what kinds of situations you are most comfortable in and use that, if you want to compromise.

She is not entitled to meeting your friends, you do not have to meet hers, it's up to the two of you to decide how your relationship should be. You need to talk to her and explain that this is not something you want, or see yourself wanting in the future.

By the way there are plenty of people who are ok with hanging out just the two of you. I don't know that this relationship is ever going to be your ideal, or hers, but you can work to make it comfortable for you both by communicating. "

hotbox4u,AskReddit,1389375067.0,"First of all sorry for my english, its not my first language.

In the summer of 1994 i met this woman with the name Celine on a train from Budapest and striked up a conversation with her. I was going to catch a flight back to Brasil and she told me she was returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. We hit it right off. People often talk about chemistry and that when you meet someone special you know it right of the bat. Well i never believed in that. Until then. We spend every second of that train ride talking. There was no moment of awkward silcene, it just felt natural to speak to this stranger about pretty much everything. And for her it seemed like the same. When we reached Vienna i convinces Celine to disembark with me. I said that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy.

At that time i was pretty broke. I had spend pretty much all my savings prior on that trip and so we decided against a hotel and decided to roam around in Vienna. I cant put into words the magic of that night. Exploring Vienna by foot is something everyone should do once in their lifetime. We visited a few landmarks and then... laugh about it, but we shared a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset. Right there we knew that this was something very very special. We continued to roam around the city and we began to talk even more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, sex, religion, art, you name it.

 She told me that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she ""loved him too much"". And i had to admit that i initially was on this trip to spend time with my girlfriend who was studying in Madrid. But we had broken up when she was avoiding me while i was there. (A whole different story) I had taken 1 month off for that trip but we already broke up after 1 1/2 weeks. So i decided to buy a Eurail pass and to travel around Europe on my own. Pretty much to escape my own life. It was than that she told me that she was ready to get off the train with me before i convinced her. 

Right there i felt something i never felt before and never felt after. I could have just looked into her eyes for the eternity. And for her it wasnt different. But we both understood that we probably would not see each other again when we left. So we simply decided to make the best of what time we had left. If we a bed available... well, we sure would have used it. But there simply wasnt enough time. I explained to her that if given the choice i would marry her instead of never seeing her again. And i meant it. With every string of my heart.

Well this didnt happend. Im sorry. I brought her to her train and just as the train was about to leave we hastily dedicded to not exchange any contact information but instead agreed to meet together at the same place in six months time.

Yes, let's thank these poor women for letting us sexually objectify them. You know what? We should thank their parents, their educational background, and their childhood. After all, do you really think these strippers grew up in luxury? Heck no, they probably grew up in poverty, hence joining a profession that only requires breasts, a buttocks, and the ability to stand on two feet. Do you think their parents were *really* there for them? I'm willing to bet that their parents were absent/intoxicated from day one. 

These girls have been **literally forced**, by society, to take up the ""job"" of stripping. Any person who supports that institution is deplorable. So should they be respected? No, they should be pitied. And helped, too."

It's true that majority of the people who are idiots have bank accounts. Does this mean that everyone who has a bank account is an idiot? No.

Anyways, getting back to the main argument. I also said don't generalize the whole US. Which is a location parameter.

Whereas people who use common grossly wrong grammatical mistakes are tied to an intelligence parameter. 

So generalizing someone based off of their individual trait, themselves specifically stating something that isn't intelligent, is more suited.

Versus generalizing someone based off of their location.

Tuala08,AskMen,1389375171.0,"I agree society focuses on looks for women and heroism type skills for men and that evolutionarily humans have developed where men are the providers and women make the babies. However, I think maybe it is time to put aside base biological urges, surely we are advanced enough to recognized they do not need to run our lives. For example, at certain times in a woman's hormone cycle she is attracted to different kinds of men.  There are days when yah the stereotypical macho male is more attractive to me than the shy nerdy guy, but my rational brain says no, that is not what would make you happy in the end.  I want some caring and kind and isn't obsessed with looks etc.  

On the other hand I think happy healthy adults are people who have at least a baseline of confidence and some sort of stability in their lives and flow of income.

WinterCharm,apple,1389375238.0,"For that, You'd have to make them thicker... 

Thats really a compromise that i question over at apple - they could have made the unibody MacBooks and MacBook pros marginally thicker and used more powerful GPU's in the 13"", and 15"" models, and even dual GPU's in the 17"" model, had they kept it around, while simultaneously expanding the heat sink and still using the case for 12-20% of cooling. 

Their design decision was to go for thinner, instead of more powerful, and without the 12-20% you get from the Al, that wouldn't have been possible. 

I really do feel that the only MacBook Pro worthy of the pro name is the 15"" Pro with a 750m, and even there, they should have used the much more powerful 765m. Razer did it with their blade laptop, which is 14"" is about as thin as a MacBook Pro, so there is no real excuse. In a 17"" pro, if apple had been focusing on power instead of just thin and light, they could have put dual GPU's inside. 

In my honest and humble opinion, I think apple is blurring the lines far too much between their Pro and Air line. 

Give me a 13"" MacBook Pro with a dedicated GPU like the 750m. Give me a 15"" with the 765m and bring back a 17"" MacBook Pro, with retina display, and dual 765m GPU's. 

These iris pro graphics are best left to the MacBook Air and maybe a single baseline 13"" pro model... 

Every other pro - 13"", 15"" and 17""  should at least have the 750m or better. "

Ramos draws with a very emotive and expressive style using a lot of alternating straight and curved surfaces that have been exaggerated for artistic effect. They look like a comic book artist's take on George Bridgman's constructive anatomy, which I think *must* be a big influence on him along with perhaps a pinch of Burne Hogarth. While certainly strongly stylized, it's apparent that there is a real understanding of anatomy even if Ramos doesn't always follow the rules. 

But then the artists that they like better are the kind with hardly any anatomic knowledge at all in which everyone is drawn like featureless blobs of skin with hardly a hint of the artist's personal style. Sometimes the artist is competent in anatomy, but then still very plain in style making it look like it could have been drawn by any number of artists, or straight up aping Ditko/Romita. "

urfouy,AskWomen,1389375414.0,"I know I'm not the ""cool"" girlfriend and reading posts like these can make me feel like I'm jealous and insecure for not being okay with strip clubs.  However, in the context of a bachelor party, it's hard to see the motive as anything other than nefarious.  Let me break it down:

**1.  The last hurrah.**  In this instance, you visit a strip club and have a shitshow party because you presumably will never have that opportunity again once you marry your fun-sucking, harpy of a girlfriend.  If that's how my fiance feels about marrying me, then I'm offended.

**2.  To test his commitmentment.**  Maybe the real test should be not going to the strip club in the first place, because a large part of staying committed to one person involves avoiding temptation right off the bat.

**3.  Celebrating a life event.**  So you're going to celebrate your commitment to me by wasting money and rubbing up on other women?  I don't get it.  Could we celebrate our lives together with a butt plug and some restraints instead?

I've given it some thought, and I would be okay with my boyfriend going to a strip club for his bachelor party if that's what he really wanted.  I know he's not going to leave me for a stripper, and he's probably got enough sense not to be goaded into having sex with a prostitute.  What a romantic memory for him to have when he thinks back on his wedding!  

However, I would hope that he would feel the same way as I do: excited to start his life with me, and underwhelmed by the idea of marking that occasion with sex workers.  "

Ralkir,changemyview,1389375423.0,"&gt;I agree that there is this attitude among many hard scientists, but that attitude doesn't discredit the established work of prominent social scientists.

You just lost the argument with this line. Your view is:

&gt;you should form your beliefs based on the consensus and common beliefs of experts in that field. 

The thing about experts in hard sciences is that they are experts in the scientific process as well. This means they are experts in what is scientifically valid as ""fact"" and what is not. Since there are more hard sciences and thus hard experts than soft ones, then the consensus of these experts is that many things soft sciences attribute as fact is not fact.

So knowing this you now have two contradictory statements. According to your belief you must automatically go with the consensus that soft science are not as valid. But you state this:

&gt; but that attitude doesn't discredit the established work of prominent social scientists.

So which is it? Either you must end up Changing your view (in which case I'll take my delta) or you change your belief about the soft sciences, which is the entire point of your CMV in the first place. "

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389375552.0,"&gt;This is the biggest problem that I have with utilitarian/consequentialist thinking. It depends on exactly this possibility. However, this isn't realistic. This will never be the case and if it were we could easily solve all of life's problems because we would know every single possibility of every single action and it would be pretty apparent which course of action would be the best. Essentially, we would be God.

You're absolutely right, and I think there are many flaws with the point of view that it's hard to justify some of the moral claims.

&gt;If we accept that it is morally permissible to end someone's life because they will lead a life of poverty it would logically follow that we could kill many human beings living in poverty at this very moment which I, and I think most people, would rightly reject.

The thing I would like to address here is a simple word from this sentence: **someone**. Who is a fetus? What person is it? An individual living in poverty is a person - they have a name, memories, a personality. A fetus doesn't even have the *capacity* for that until the 2nd trimester.

&gt;And that is my solution. We need to fix these issues by dealing with poverty, unemployment etc., not by abortion. We, literally, shouldn't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

I absolutely agree. But should we be making people's lives *harder* than it already is by raising a child they may not want?

&gt;If it doesn't, it follows that we can end its life whenever we please and for whatever reason.

Well no, not *when*ever we please. Most of the limits on abortion, while somewhat arbitrary, are framed around the concept of ""personhood"" and viability outside the womb. When a fetus *can* live on its own and has reasonably developed central nervous system is when I would say that it acquires rights.

Let's say that there was a human body but it had a supremely underdeveloped brain and needed to be connected to you to gain the development. And not just for the 9 months of cerebral development, but you would have to care for it for at least another ~16 years. Would you be willing to make that sacrifice?"

Vegemeister,AskMen,1389375605.0,"&gt; Making the test mandatory is an assumption that everyone cheats. I find that ridiculous. 

It is an assumption that *some* people cheat, that it is not socially practical to test the paternity of your child unless everyone does it or you do it in secret, and that some people are too naive to conduct secret paternity tests and are raising other men's children while having none of their own.

&gt;I'm not trying to protect my power or any such nonsense.

Then what is your motivation for opposing mandatory paternity testing?  As I said in the other branch, the cost is less than $200.

&gt;Like I said, my SO and I love and trust each other equally.

I do not doubt that.

&gt;And if all women are so likely to cheat, who's to say the men aren't out there banging other women and impregnating them?

Undoubtedly, some are. But those men's wives aren't pouring their emotions and labor into some other woman's child. And none of them are putting off getting pregnant again because of a bastard they don't even know exists.

&gt;You know how I know my SO is not doing that? Same way he knows I'm not: love and trust.

This sort of sentiment is exactly why paternity testing should be mandatory. Trying to verify that the child you are raising shares your genes and that you have successfully procreated gets you accused of *not loving your significant other.*

ebonlance,Warmachine,1389375632.0,"15 points is tough for any warlock; one that wants a ton of Heavies like Abby makes it even worse.

If you're intent on using Typhon (not a bad plan) I might structure the list like this:

Abby +5
Typhon -12
Raek -4
Shredder -2
Shredder -2

This gives you a lot of options. Typically I'd put Playing God on the Raek and Forced Evo on Typhon - this sounds weird but Raek having 2-handed throws is nasty. Have a Raek leap behind an enemy, throw him toward Typhon, and let Typhon very, very easily finish the job himself. Forced Evo and Tenacity stack, giving Typhon a very respectable defense. The two shredders are little guided missles for tying up an enemy, don't expect them to contribute a ton at low points. 

The Raek also grants Parry, meaning that if Abby had Flight she can fly right over and finish the job herself if need be. Having an accurate assassination warlock around is a huge boon at low points. 

The feat is useful but any savvy opponent is going to kill your beasts in one go if they can."

I am curious about this power women seem to have because in my experience and observation it always seems like the men who have the power in the relationships. The women (that I know) care too much, become committed and invested and the man decides she has gotten too fat, or is putting work about him, or is too boring in bed and up and leaves.  
I think you should have hope! Everyone here is collectively helping me understand the pressure from the male point of view. I really didn't know there were so many.  What am I confused about though is that women also seek approval from others, and in extreme cases this can lead women to sleep around because they are looking for male approval. However, I think for the majority, while we do look for our peers to think our outfit is hot or whatever, it doesn't seem to have the same effect on our self esteem.

&gt; I'm not that kind of person though to write someone off I love just because of a decision they would want to make.

Sometimes a deal-breaker is a deal-breaker, even if you love someone. My girlfriend broke up with me a week ago. She is bipolar, and literally can't handle a relationship because she feels smothered. Doesn't mean that she never loved me. But love isn't always enough.

I also used to be married. I figured out I was trans during the marriage. It wasn't okay with my wife, so I didn't transition. Eventually she came to realize that I would need to transition eventually so she left me for someone who actually wanted to be a guy. It was a dealbreaker.

Sometimes love isn't enough. Doesn't mean that that love is not real love, because you can love someone but know that a relationship can't continue.

Obviously I can't tell you what might happen in a theoretical relationship. It's very possible that you can get over your girlfriend getting a vagina. But you also need to consider if that is really okay with you.

Truly submissive females exist, but so do truly submissive males. That's where the flaw in that logic is.

goingnowhere21,AskReddit,1389375929.0,"I've really had to think much about this over the past few years. I was raised Serbian Orthodox, but not to an extent where religion was a main part of our lives. My parents never pushed it on me, and it was really only once or twice a year we would attend church. Ultimately, I feel I believe in a God, but not to the extent that organized religion does. I don't really support the Bible, nor not everything said to me in church. Although I have heard some great sermons before by very kind priests about being good to one another. Christianity has such a violent past, and I don't like associating myself with that. I still have full respect for anyone that follows any religion, as long as they're a better person for it. Atheists have my respect too, because their way of thinking is completely reasonable. 

I think the differences are what make us unique, and instead of fighting each other because we're different, we should embrace our differences to learn from each other and respect our beliefs. It's a little corny, but for me, it's true."

""The only issue here is whether its legal or not.""

Excellent reply! Why does the nuance always stop right there and proceed no further with you guys?

The law being loopholed to enable approaching half of all guns to be passed from background check cleared buyer to unbackground checked second hand buyer, is an issue, with the argument that only crazies and criminals kill people, NOT GUNS, then you resist all talk or ideas of reforming a law that invalidates approaching half of all gun sales, from being prevented to be sold to criminals and crazies.

If your only logic is, MUH LAWS MUH FREEDOM, you make your camp look wilfully ignorant and irresponsible. Laws like that should be tightened."

You probably don't want to start with ""Hey, you're cute, let's go out sometime."" You're better off trying to comment on something like ""It's always so busy at this time"" or ask for help picking something out. 

If you're in a situation where you have more time, like a couple other posters said, you could write your name on a napkin, have a drink sent over etc. You could also introduce yourself, have a chat, then go about your business and if she's interested she might approach you again. 

Common ground is your friend here. Try your best to quickly find something you can connect over. Is she wearing a concert t-shirt of a band you like? Reading a book you like?

I'd say both were fucked though because there ARE some skills (other than baby making) that come naturally more to men than women and vice versa and we need that balance for survival.  I went to an all girls school and it was so obvious how important just having male presence can be... people who think that if women ran the world then there would be no wars has never been in an all girl situation for very long. Something about having some testosterone in the room actually affects how women act towards each other. I have also seen this in the small office I work in, how much better the atmosphere was when there was a man working there.  
However, yes it is harder to make more people when there are less women, but why is all of this so based on biology? I feel like shouldnt we be advanced enough now to admit/realize we can move beyond that?  Just because a guy can't make a baby or a woman isn't very good at sex or whatever, doesn't mean anyone is expendable. Maybe I am just way too idealistic but I think everyone has inherent value for things under than their sperm, womb, money or looks.

edit: also, the Marlins are hemorrhaging money and fans because Samson and Loria don't know how to do anything besides sign big name free agents and cross their fingers for good results. Samson won a World Series 10 years ago, true (he was busy engineering the inglorious end to the Montreal Expos when the Marlins won their first in 1997, so please don't try to give him credit for that), but immediately after that he traded away the best hitter of our generation (along with the rest of the team) in what many consider to be the worst trade of the decade. They are 939-1,004 under Samson, and they haven't had more than two winning seasons in a row since they won that World Series. 

The comment below (or above) mine doesn't surprise me at all because Cubs fans are probably the only fanbase more miserable than the Marlins' — because they haven't won a World Series since 1908.

slockley,AskReddit,1389376185.0,"&gt; What if there is a god, but not the one you pray to? (and they are a lot of them to choose from)

Christianity is an obvious choice in that case.  Many views of God are widely inclusive, so it's an easy in on those.  Christianity describes the path to Heaven as being narrow and exclusive of other ""gospels.""  So Pascal's wager would lend one to side with a highly exclusive religion, of which Christianity is one.

&gt; If you base your faith on a wager and you're right, isn't god going to think you're an hypocrite?

The bible recognizes that people are self-interested.  It is assumed that people are out for their own well-being, and it is indeed part of how we are designed.  God never begrudges self-interest that isn't in violation with His interest.  So, assuming one sides with the Bible, I think it's okay.

And even if the path to a saving belief in God isn't perfect, hypocrites get to go to heaven too (per Christianity).  All sin is forgivable.  Ultimately salvation is not dependent on a person's love for God but God's love for that person.  Nobody impresses God with how authentic they are, but some get to spend eternity with Him anyway."

rws247,AskScienceFiction,1389376257.0,"&gt; Most FTL travel isn't any different from modern day travel

That's not true. FTL stands for Faster Than Light, in contrast ""modern day travel"" is bound to a limit of the speed of light. FTL is by definition a means to travel faster than possible via normal methods (rockets, ion drives, supercolliders).

As /u/colsatre says: FTL is a category for all means of travel that beat the speed of light. Travel by wormholes falls in this category. In most lores, there is only a single form of FTL travel, so that could simply be called the FTL drive (without specifying what form of FTL).

dHarmonie,ChronicPain,1389376262.0,"Well I'm female so the first thing to go were bras followed by restricting my activities and I went to PT immediately after x-rays confirmed that I didn't have any fractures. Physical therapy has honestly helped me most because it's given me better body awareness and taught me how to fix my more common hyperextension related injuries myself instead of getting stuck in the diagnosis loop. 

Your pain is probably different than mine, but experiment with propping yourself up in different ways with pillows or on furniture to make yourself more comfortable until you can get a proper diagnosis and treatment thing going. It took me years to figure out the pillow thing so I hope that helps.

I can't take NSAIDs or analgesics that are normally OTC so my relief had to be 100% from finding comfortable positions and icing/ heating. I bought a boyfriend pillow, the ones with the arms? I flipped it over so it makes a wedge then put pillows on one side to distribute my weight more towards the un-injured half of my chest while still lying down relatively flat. (Hospitals do something similar to keep bed sores from forming. I saw them do it to my dad when he was sick and thought ""hey there's a good idea for joint pain). It made it so my abs weren't fully contracted (like in the fetal position) or extended (lying flat) so that my ribs didn't have a lot of pulling from my larger muscle groups. The other one was holding a pillow close to my chest and then another in between my knees so that when I lay down on the uninjured side, my body didn't kind of 'fold' on itself.

He doesn't willingly/actively go himself (as far as I'm aware), but has gone for bachelor parties etc. Is that true, that typical guys go rather frequently?

Edit: I should add I've never seriously dated anyone who's gone to strip clubs frequently, actually none who had even ever been to one, so I guess I know the answer already, but I'm not really knowledgeable on the frequency of these sorts of behaviors. Current boyfriend has a particular group of friends who seem to go all the time,  and he seems to think its typical, so I have no idea.

Edit 2: I guess I'll add... I don't trust people tell me how they really feel about things. If someone says they don't enjoy something in order to grant me security, I think they're full of shit but let it go because there's no point in working myself up. "

 particles and ground fruit pits, and these rough-edged particles are not
 appropriate for use on sensitive skin.**  However, most skin types can tolerate

When I wasn't single, it almost never crossed my mind to do those small little things like what you want. Now that I have a job and can afford stuff, I'm a little more prone to just randomly getting something for a friend. (currently single, so no gf to give gifts to)

I'm not big on receiving gifts, and that turns into me also not being one to give gifts either.

Simply put, you'll just have to keep telling him what you're wanting. Eventually it will stick in his brain. After 4 years, I think he's just incredibly happy to have you around and may not feel like he needs to show it through a random gift of flowers or dinner."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389376473.0,"Cool story, that. Basically, Irish and Scottish people (and other European minorities) weren't considered ""white"" until they could point at brown and black people and say ""at least we're not them."" So they became white by being racist against black people. Also, by being perceived as at least a step up from being black.

This is also how Jews became respectable in New York, to a certain extent: by being racist fucks against black people. Some Jews argued for gathering power and allies amongst the black communities to tear down barriers between their two populations and the rest of ""white"" (read: not black or Jewish) population of New York. Other Jews said ""nah, let's just show the rest of the white people we're like them by being assholes to black people.""

Of course, this didn't fully work, and racism and antisemitism continues to be a powerful force. But it did kind of work in that most people now consider those of Scottish, Irish, and Jewish descent to be white.

Yay?"

_Wilfred_,AskReddit,1389376775.0,"I was raised in a christian home. Always had to go to church on sunday and got into it more when i was older. Went more than once a week and was fairly involved in the church i attended. 

After graduating high school I took a philosophy course and stopped going to church. I wanted to hear more opinions about life, and try to make my own conclusions. After a lot of thinking and learning i still dont know exactly what I subscribe to.

I really think that the idea of religion is a good thing. As humans we are limited in what we know about the world around us. We will always have unanswered questions in our lives. Thats fine, but some of those questions cause more anguish than others. Religion fills some of those holes. You can find peace in the thought that God has a plan for your life. Its comforting to know that God is going to take care of you when you die. When bad things happen in your life its easy to turn to God. Even though everything in your life is up to you, people still admit that God is in control and that he has a plan. Its like a survival technique, something that we are born with. Its a simple way to deal with life, good or bad. It allows us to remove ourselves somewhat, and that helps ease our way into the next stages of whats going on. 

I would compare religion to a really good SO. You can turn to them and trust them in your time of need. You can credit them when everything is going well in your life. It doesn't really matter who that SO is, as long as they fill the roll that you need. Tall god, small god, rough, tough, soft god. Its the idea in general that helps you deal, but really life would go on just the same without that."

RichardBehiel,spacex,1389376941.0,"Oh yeah, I don't think SpaceX needs to make commercials.  It's not like any billionaire is going to be watching TV and then all of a sudden be like ""You know what, I feel like buying a rocket.""

That said, I do think that having the support of pretty much an entire nation would benefit SpaceX.  If nothing else it would be a great PR stunt, and they'd probably make a little more money off of merchandise (which I know is pretty negligible, but still).  Keep in mind that SpaceX does care quite a bit about PR, given the quality of their webcasts, videos, twitter/facebook posts, the user-friendliness of their website, etc; they do want to get the public interested in what they're doing.

Furthermore, think of the children!  How many more STEM majors would the world have in a decade or so if SpaceX became a household name?  Elon Musk is all about helping humanity, so I wouldn't be surprised at all if he decided to advertise SpaceX, if only for the sake of increasing the popularity of engineering among the youth.

However, I do think it's a bit too early for SpaceX to advertise.  I think the ideal time to drop a mind-blowing commercial would be right before the first crewed Dragon launch.  Get people all hyped up about it a few days before it happens so that a ton of people watch the webcast.  SpaceX would be the hero that put Americans back into space, and everyone would know about it.

Anyways, just some thoughts."

The way I see it, it does both; shrewd and smart marketing... some of us may not like that but the fact is that it just plain works in the current business climate...  even better when both sides of the issue are fighting over the media and giving it tons more attention and, by proxy, free viral marketing,  which is why the show has been running for so long and kept a reasonable modicum of popularity.

I think the same impulse will likely always be with us. Whether it manifests as abstruse debates over Christology, or bizarre definitions of what it means to be asexual (apparently, asexuality is fully compatible with sexual attraction, sexual activity, etc?), or whatever. Meanwhile, society will continue on, for better or for worse. The faction of intolerant pedants may always be with us, but how much power they wield varies throughout history. In our society, they wield a fairly small amount. In the Byzantine empire, they wielded rather a lot.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389377071.0,"&gt;This will sound like I'm being facetious,

I was sounding a bit facetious as well, so all is fair :P.

I think we should simply go from the point of the view that needless suffering is not a thing we would want any creature to go through, and that there are plenty of humane, albeit expensive ways to sacrifice animals.  On top of this, if we're at least trying to reduce suffering since it seems that many are reluctant to forego meat consumption, there is plenty of evidence showing that stress hormones negatively effect the flavor and texture of meat.

&gt;But behaviorists and other scientists (and normal people) see chickens raised in battery cages or even in ""cage free"" warehouses, and they are very clearly not as pleased as are those on, say, an animal sanctuary.

My argument isn't that the animals aren't leading a less enjoyable life than those that are allowed to roam freely and live stress free, but that it's hard to to determine whether or not an animal would want to exist or not exist at all. Very few animals commit suicide, even in very dire situations - which suggests that animals have this much stronger desire to live. Why? Who knows.

&gt;I think it's safe to say that a being who has the capacity to know ""joy"" and suffering would not be grateful for a life that has none of the former and an excess of the latter.

I think it's good that you framed joy as such, because that's a very hard thing to pin down. What joys does a chicken have? They don't really spend a lot of time in play, but they eat a lot. They probably also derive some pleasure from sex, as that would facilitate reproduction. But chickens are essentially specialized reptiles, and reptiles don't seem to have the developed brain regions for complex emotional processing.

&gt;Regardless, even if we had no way of knowing how they feel for sure... why would we keep subjecting them to this awful, short life? If we don't know, isn't it better to err on the side of caution?
Basically, I don't think lack of understanding/inability to relate exact emotions shouldn't be a reason that we breed billions of beings into suffering every year.

I agree completely. The only reason such stress is induced upon these animals is because it is the cheapest way to do it that we currently know of. I don't think that's a good justification for it, and I want to see it changed."

slapdashbr,buildapc,1389377106.0,"Normally I would suggest the 4570 over the 4670 because the $20 price difference gets you a microscopic performance increase (you'll never notice the difference). For only $10 more, it's p to you I guess whether you care about the tiny difference. No game I know of will max out any haswell i5, even the slowest version let alone the 4570 or 4670, but I suppose it can't hurt. Other than that, with a non-overclocking setup, you don't need a Z87 mobo. An inexpensive B85 chipset mobo still supports all the features you could want. There is no SLI option unless you stick with Z87, but if you are using a 1080p monitor, you will not need SLI for the forseeable future. A single 770 is plenty powerful for any modern game. You can double the size of the SSD with the money you are saving. I went with the similar, but more compact fractal design arc mini R2. It has pretty much the same features as the R4 including a window, in mATX form factor. The R4 is quite large- unless you are building a super high end rig, I recommend going with the smaller case. Since you don't need any more power that about 500W, I also switched to a much cheaper PSU. The rosewill Hive line is good quality, the 550W model should be perfect for your build.

jenniferocious,AskWomen,1389377209.0,"I have personal space issues. If possible, I wouldn't sit right next to *any* stranger, be it on a bus or in a movie theater or wherever, regardless of gender. I really have issues with people I don't know touching/having physical contact with me, even if it is accidental. Being on a crowded bus or in another crowded place with lots of people in close proximity stresses me out and gives me anxiety, so I tend to seek out a place in a corner or against a wall. If that isn't possible, I make myself as compact as I can and try to maintain my personal bubble of space. Unless I *had* to sit down for some reason, I would rather stand and maybe have more space than sit right next to someone I don't know/am not comfortable with. It has nothing to do with being creepy or not, it could be the friendliest-looking or most attractive guy (or woman) in the world and I wouldn't want to sit so close. 

If a person *offered* me a seat near them, then I'd have to decide if it is worth it to possibly offend the person by declining. I might take it and deal with my discomfort to avoid potentially offending the other person, since I *know* that they are most likely just being polite and that my issues are completely unjustified. 

Anyway, don't take it personally. It isn't necessarily because you seem ""creepy"" or any other negative adjective can be applied to you, there are many reasons why a woman (or any person) may choose to stand rather than sit. I'm not the norm, by any means, but my issues are entirely my own and have nothing to do with the people around me."

If I don't run so well and find myself behind a shorter stack, I'll tighten up again and wait for hands I'd be will to sacrifice my tournament life on in 3-bet all-in situations, as well as open/call all-in situations.

You want to protect short stacks because having them at your table freezes many of the other players with slightly bigger stacks. They begin less willing to gamble when there are other players who are so flow to busting themselves. So be friendly to short stacks by being more willing to give them walks or by 3-betting if you suspect an average stack is trying to steal from them. "

Try the 3 second rule. Once you see a cute girl you have three seconds to approach. It worked well for me. If I wanted to approach and pussied out I would punish myself by adding exercises to my workout. If I approached I would reward myself with something (junk food, clothes, etc). After a while though, when I stopped having such severe AA, approaching became its own reward. "

Kodiac136,AskReddit,1389377348.0,"I lived in Poland at the time. I happened to be in Warszawa on business, but I lived in Łódź. So after I had finished up in Warszawa, I went back to the train station to catch a ride back home. There were 2 women walking around that were obviously totally lost and confused, so I went and talked to them. Turns out they were both from England and both primary school teachers. They didn't speak a word of Polish and couldn't figure out the train system. They were in Poland for a sort of field trip type thing, where they filmed parts of their journey to show their students. I helped them figure out where they needed to go-turns out they were headed to Łódź as well. So I helped them on the train and got them a taxi to their hotel after arriving. It was so much fun and I often wonder what they are up to. I got to say hi to their students on their film, I hope the kids thought it was interesting. I wish I could say hello to them again, they were great people."

As to why this answer, i suggest you watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww). But the idea I want to explore is that despite mathematicians dealing with infinity on a regular basis, we can generally push out some real answers to some of these problems. Some of these answers are not intuitive, but they do fit into observable problems (say in physics) that further enforces their validity.

Ultimately, in having to deal with infinity, one may not necessarily need an answer that pertains to the notion of a supernatural entity."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1389377538.0,"Are you fucking serious? What good does that do for the child? All it's going to do is shatter the image of their mom (which, trust me, is not something you get over in a day) and fuck up their view of relationships. 

This is the kind of shit kids have to go to therapy for. They don't fucking need to know. If one of my parents sat me down and told me that the other one cheated I would be so fucking pissed. I'd be livid. Unless she was abandoning the child because of it they don't need to know. The consequences *severely* outweigh whatever ""lesson"" they'll learn. Especially since *we don't line in a society that condones cheating at all.* They can learn their lesson some other way that won't result in their need for years of therapy. 

In fact, if you grow up knowing that the people around you have cheated you're more likely to think it's normal. It creates trust issues, anger, guilt, confusion, and resentment. 

There are consequences (like getting divorced) and then there's destroying her life for a one time major fuck up while using the kids as collateral damage. 

If they went to a therapist, the therapist would tell them *not to tell the child.* My parents went to couple's counseling (to try for an amicable divorce), and they were told not to tell us any details of what was going on. It was a little too late and I had learn some stuff, but that advice for them probably saved me a lot more issues. I don't *want* to know what happened. Of course if they sat me down and told me, ""Hey, your mother cheated"" I would ask details because they just opened pandoras box. It would be like a train wreck you can't look away from.

It sounds like you think the kids are going to learn their mom cheat, get pissed at their mom, and live their merry lives, and say ""I'm never going to do that! Yay!"". It's not going to fucking work like, I promise. They are going to grieve for the loss of who they thought their mother was. They are going to lose trust in her. Or, they might try to console her and feel like they have to make her feel better, and they'll feel guilty got it. They're going to have to choose sides. They are going to be put in positions that they should never be put into. 

This is not an appropriate topic for your child to know about. It's a separate issue with their relationship. You do not air out your dirty laundry to your own children. Even if your child is twenty something, *don't do it.* There are boundaries you have between children and parents, and telling them shit like this is not okay. I don't care what people think on here. ""We need to teach this women a lesson and the kids will know this is what happens when you cheat!!!!"" Nope. The damage is too severe for the children. You don't use your children as punishment, you just don't. "

Also, I loved how they proved my point that rights are only as real as we make them. Now, people will wonder why I think we should treat human life with dignity if I don't believe in human rights in a traditional sense and beleive it's socially constructed, and that's because I believe the GOAL of morality IS humanity, and the harm principle goes  very much against what a legitimate moral system is all about. Once morality doesnt protect human life and well being, it loses its utility and becomes corrupt. Which is how I can debunk this property right extremism libertarians have. It runs counter to the primary goal of morality...to enhance our lives and well being.

It was a joke and the easiest class I've ever taken. It was a lot of review for me and really, really basic Spanish. After that, I took the EM test and tested out of the whole series.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389377593.0,"It's a certain kind of fallacy to speak for everyone of my ethnicity, but I'll do it anyway. I grew up in a predominately minority area. Like you put all the white kids on one end of the gym, and all the not white kids on the other, and they'd out number us three-to-one. So maybe I have a little insight on this, I don't know.

Anyways, I really don't know how many times in my life I've been called cracker or honkey (this one ironically). You lose count. Never called anyone wetback, spic, or nigger. *Ever*. You don't fucking say those words. Not because I'm a minority in my childhood neighborhood, but because it was really obvious that nobody said ""cracker"" with the intent to start shit. Well, they might say it with a certain intonation if they wanted to start shit. But most people would go straight to ""bitch"", not ""cracker"", since attacking me for being female is way more convenient than the color of my skin. For white dudes, everyone goes straight to ""asshole"" or ""pussy ass bitch."" At least in my area and the years I was in high school.

But I hung out with mostly white and asian kids. We were always referred to as ""those crackers over there"" by other groups of people, especially if those people were non-white. They didn't seem to mean it derogatorily. We were just white.

So I was ""that person"" for a good portion of my life. Been called a cracker. Affectionately even. Don't mean a damn thing."

hopewings,babyloss,1389377618.0,"&gt; As for not feeling like a mom... Not sure anything but time and another baby will help me on that one. I wish it could be different, but I am in an odd space between two major life spans, and can't fully relate to either one anymore. I can't talk to other moms about 3 am feedings, diaper changes, or teething. But I don't fit in with all my girlfriends who have never had kids anymore either.

*Many hugs to you*

I remember that time.  It was very lonely, very dark and very sad.  I was a mother without a child, but I had not even experienced the trials and tribulations of new motherhood.  Nobody else in my life really understood except my husband and my mother-in-law, who were father and grandmother without a baby.  We grieved together, but it was a private grief, because all we had were a few mementos and some sad photos that we couldn't really share, because nobody really wants to see morbid pictures.  We are not religious either, but we are ""spiritual,"" and it did help me personally get through that terrible time.

But time and a healthy baby did help heal the wound, though I still think about our first little boy all the time.  The pregnancy with our second son was nerve-wracking, because I had a miscarriage (we lost a little girl at almost second trimester) between the stillbirth and giving birth to our second son.  After that miscarriage, which had its own complications including a multi-day hospital stay for a massive uterine infection (incomplete D&amp;C), I felt like I couldn't go on anymore.  I was fortunate to have such an amazing husband, who told me that he would love me and stay with me even if we could never have children.  I had to come to terms with that possibility and grieve thoroughly.

I'm very grateful to have gotten pregnant easily just a few months after that.  These days I look at our sweet healthy little baby boy who is getting so big, and I think about how old his older brother would have been.  It's a wound that never fully closes, but that feeling of empty arms and complete failure at not being able to be a ""real mom,"" that feeling did subside.  I even allow myself to feel joy and happiness sometimes, knowing all the while that I must cherish these moments, because I have known loss, and I know it can happen to anybody.

Finally, don't feel like you are a horrible person for not acknowledging your daughter.  As my husband told me, it's you doing a stranger a favor by not burdening that person with such heavy thoughts.  They are just making smalltalk to pass the time.  In time, you will be able to share these thoughts with people who are closer to you, but for now, take care of yourself and don't beat yourself up over every little thing.

coralshroom,AskReddit,1389377631.0,"i was raised catholic... i am quite firmly atheist/non-religious now.

when i was much younger, maybe around 10 or 11, the first problem i began to have with the church was that because of my gender, there was no place for me in it except as a follower. it didn't sit right with me to base my whole worldview on an institution that excluded me from even the most minor of roles because of this. as i became older and more informed, a lot of the language i heard in mass or in catholic publications began to disgust me, in the way it referred and/or gave special treatment to and/or totally excluded women, LBGT individuals, etc. 

then, when i was 13, one of my parents died. everyone was telling me to pray, say the rosary, ask god for strength - and honestly, it did nothing for me. it was a crisis point in my 'faith' (i use the term loosely, because religion was something i did because everyone else did, and apparently they took it more seriously than i), because the more i did it, the stupider i felt. i wasn't going to get strength from god, if this strength came from anywhere it was from me, not some abstract entity other people tried to hammer into my brain my whole life.

I already had a shaky foundation, and any questions i had were answered with, 'you just have to have faith' 'pray and the answer will come to you'. it just wasn't enough for me.  

it's still a point of contention in my family, because they expect me to come to church with them on the major holidays, and be baptism/confirmation sponsors, and i just can't do it.   "

Whatever that costs, provided it's not unreasonable.  A completely new car when he's got a 2012 is a bit of a stretch, but considering the severity of the fuckup, you just do it.

The older stock is more conservative about sexuality and gender expression in general, but even that really depends. 
This is anecdotal, but small cities that are more isolated tend to have underground hotspots and networks of LGB/t folks. The dating and living might be a bit more covert than a big city with a gayborhood. But the communities will often be closer knit and...more like actual communities. if you meet one ""hub"" or...there's a word for this, but I'm blanking on it...basically one LGB person who knows or has dated half the LGB population, you will know everyone.

This is also a much more compact build. The only thing that is truly less powerful is the CPU, but an overclocked i5 still has tons of power for any modern application. 

I would highly suggest taking the money saved, and investing in a good 250GB SSD, and depending on what you currently have, a high-quality 1080p IPS monitor, or maybe a nice mechanical keyboard and mouse. You could also bump up to a gtx 770, although the 760 should be perfectly good for gaming at 1080p IMO. 

Edit: Dell has just released some good monitors with their ""professional"" line, the P2314H is an excellent pick for gaming and general use. A bit cheaper than the top-level ultrasharp line, but still excellent quality and a 3-year warranty. It just started selling in the US for $169, I can't find it on the UK pcpartpicker but you should look for it in stores or somewhere you can order from. http://www.dell.com/ed/business/p/dell-p2314h/pd"

Are you bulking up with muscle?  Since it underlies your fat, it could be that you are gaining muscle faster than you are losing your fat.

I ask because I have a similar problem too.  I bulk up very easily with muscle when I do strenuous workouts with even just moderate resistance.  I bike ride ~100-150 miles per week.  Heck, just because I am overweight, all of my workouts can be considered high resistance.  My clothes (my 'fat' pants especially) are tight on me though I am in good shape.

Grew up in a very secular white middle-class society, family supported my fascination of all things science, and church was something you went to when

c) someone died
d) someone had a kid and a baptism is a great excuse to show off the baby for the relatives (and coax presents them)

Went through confirmation (lutheran style), figured out halfway in that I am completely faithless and wanted to drop out since it felt really dishonest to pursue it further after that. Finished it anyway after being bribed/guilt-tripped by the family (presents after confirmation is pretty much certain, I was guaranteed my first mobile phone, and they pulled the ""*your grandparents would be so proud if you did this*""-card).

joshuran,DnD,1389378030.0,"I had a changeling rogue in 4e a little while ago. Your back story seems pretty great, and I'd like to share one of my favorite things from that adventure (because changelings are great)!

My party was never told she was a changeling. They also believed I was actually controlling an assortment of characters who were connected by my main ""half-elf,"" the leader of a thieves' guild. Every so often, the story would necessitate that my ""half-elf"" go deal with her responsibilities, but she'd send a lieutenant along with the party. As a player, I also controlled that lieutenant (another rogue, of course), telling the party I wanted to try something a little different. 

She often did this to make her network seem bigger than it was, and to make herself look more ""imperial,"" too important to deal with minor issues. By performing ""great"" deeds herself, she only looked like a single ""foolish"" hero at best, or an ineffective leader who ran off to chase whims at worst. If people performed great deeds on her behalf, swearing full allegiance to her as they did it, proclaiming her glory all the way... that creates the reputation she wanted. She also hated to miss the action. She's been her own lover a few times.

Ultimately, the party discovered her secret by tailing one of her alter egos, and she failed the necessary perception checks to realize their presence! She tried to convince them she just had the ability to change into one other person, but they weren't buying it.

She also had more than a few tearaway clothes, and always dressed in layers. She had a portable hole in which she carried a multitude of gear bags, containing clothes, weapons, and supplies unique to each alter ego."

Amount spending? -We got them on sale! The three matching dresses were $50 and the MOH dress was $100 (our mother is helping her out with the cost, otherwise I would have helped her out if she needed it).

When were they ordered? -We did it about two months into our nine month engagement.

Where did we get them? -The three matching dresses they ordered from Kohl's. The MOH dress we got from David's Bridal.

Any unique challenges? -One of my bridesmaids is across the country due to grad school. They're all recently graduated or currently in college, so I didn't want them to spend a huge amount on their dresses. After going back and forth on what I wanted for them I decided to just pick a dress they could all order in their size. If all of the girls had lived near me I would have gotten them all together to discuss it in more detail. They were very kind in letting me pick something that I like so I, in return, am letting them take the wheel on any alterations they might need.

Add Mission to the bunch, and those are the only 4 cities in the GVRD with an violent crime index over 100, sort of making Surrey and Vancouver the bad apples of the bunch.

Edit* Little more info in the numbers, apparent the baseline of 100 is set from Canada average in 2006, and in 2012 StatsCan changed reporting to broader regions, so each municipality isn't broken out."

Only in recent times have we even begun to characterize logically what less recently was referred to as a soul. In the times of the ancients they may have thought that the voice in their head was that of the gods(Greek Muses).

WithMyFaceInMyPalm,AskMen,1389378245.0,"That was sarcasm and you're supposed to say ""I trained my husband"" or some such.

But really if a girl is teaching me how to get girls like her, and yet she herself remains unobtanium to me... then what the hell?

Anyway - In my opinion the most difficult part of the whole process is finding available, quality, approachable women once you get out of college. Talking to them and being confident is not remotely difficult compared to finding the right girl to talk to. Because when you find the right girl talking comes easy and they let you know they like things about you which boosts confidence.

Something like 80% of the girls in my dating range are taken and not available which makes approaching girls a pretty daunting task. My favorite, most consistent, and most natural tactic is to say SOMETHING to a girl you MIGHT like when you are out. Don't bust moves or inject yourself into their situation, just say SOMETHING to them at some point. Then, IF YOU GET LUCKY and happen to see them out and about again you bring up that you remember seeing them at such and such, and can start a conversation of sorts or just straight up ask for a number depending on circumstances.

Throw cold approaching out the window and forget it ever existed. It's wierd enough cold approaching a group of guys EVEN if you have a lot in common. Approaching a lady/group of ladies who automatically and instinctly have determined your sole purpose in talking to them is to sleep with them is just insane."

The problem with selling away half the team on a whim is that it alienates fans much more than winning a World Series endears fans. And doing it immediately following a World Series win completely neuters all the momentum and excitement built in that year. No one wants to spend time, energy, and money following a team that looks completely different every year. 

That's why the Marlins have spent only one season under Samson outside of the bottom 5 in attendance. Meanwhile the Cubs in that same span haven't spent a single year outside of the top 10. So I think you might be the only fan who feels that way."

She's not personally attacking him, she's not reminding him of his short comings out of the blue. 

Let me give you two statements, one in an abusive tone, and then again in a nice tone. 

""You're fucking stupid""

""Sometimes you do things that don't show off your intelligence"" 

See a difference? Hopefully not, because said either way it's abusive. Now let's do the same thing with her statements.

""That depends, is there enough in the millions of cereal boxes you have""

""You leave a lot of cereal boxes around, do they have any cereal in them or are they empty""

See the difference here? One is rude, it's snappy, the other is bringing up a concern.

After that, she is constantly raped, and in between riding a horse all day and being ridden like one all night, she can barely walk and wants to die. 
Even the scene that turns it all around fucks me off, as when she first says 'No', he clearly intends to ignore her. It's not before she introduces a fun new position to him that he decides to pay attention. Oh, what a romantic moment. And even after that, half of the respect she gets is for the son she's carrying.

Indirect observation is still observation, no? We wouldn't need to see a black hole directly to see its effects on the surrounding bodies or light. We're still gaining knowledge from how this happens.

I think the main thrust of my argument, is that while perhaps understanding of syntax and vocal distinction might be an instinctive trait, the overwhelming majority of our knowledge is garnered through empirical means. Even the idea of analytic truths is determined with our senses. Perhaps it's something I can't wrap my head around at the moment (and I will read your link on constructive empiricism later when I'm not working), but no one determines prior to the acquisition of senses that 2+2=4, even if it is a self-evident truth.

This will cost you $20 if you can't get the CPU at microcenter. If you can get to a microcenter, they offer the faster version of the i3 for only $129, and you can get at least some motherboards there with a $25-40 combo discount, so you may be able to save even more money. Anything else you should be able to order shipped to you even if you can't get to the store. An i3 with a GTX 760 will plow through modern games. For almost all games it's not even any slower than a quad-core i5. Given the price difference, this is pretty much your best bet at under $650. The case, power supply, HDD, etc. are all good quality as well, from the reviews I've read. "

pathein_mathein,AskHistorians,1389378712.0,"1. We don't know. We don't necessarily have records of critical reception other than what the plays themselves talk about and the victory records for each comedy festival. We don't have record of *Lysistrata* winning, but this in and of itself doesn't really prove much other than people voted for a different play. For all when know, they liked the music better. But...

2. ...the play is sort of less subversive than all that. Lysistrata is very much an Aristophanic hero - the sane person who realizes that a crazy world requires a crazy plan. **Everyone's** desperate for sex in the play. She has to fight with women wanting to leave the acropolis for sex more than making demands of the men. There's a certain ""when pigs fly"" (or, indeed, in the case of the *Peace*, dung beetles) to most Aristophanes that touches on the war, which seems to represent something more like a demand for different vision out of the politicians of the day that requires an outsider of some sort (a meme that we definitely still have in the U.S.), with Lysistrata being that outsider here. To that extent, she has to be a woman to make the plot function, not necessarily to make the fantasy of the plot (the fantasy of a sex-strike being fantasy enough). Note, for instance, most of the jokes don't operate from her being in control over men (those jokes would come in the *Ecclesiazusae*, another later play of his), but either the A) sex-mad Yakety Sax business of both genders (and this is probably more focused on the women), B) the sort of gender wars tropes of the chorus, and C) the sort of not-joke jokes of Lysistrata discussing women's troubles in war (which Aristophanes had poked at at least once before in the *Acharnians*, making this a full development of that idea). 

3. Yes, at least all the parts that spoke/sung. The second question is a bit more speculative. On one hand, it wouldn't be as atypical as us moderns seeing someone in drag during a show. On the other, well, comedy does operate by mocking mimicry.

4. Homosexuality in Ancient Greece is it's own topic and way beyond the confines of the play. It's safe to say that heterosexual and homosexual sexual contact isn't the same, so wasn't just something you would sub in."

I think this will tie into your response in regards to my analogy, so I will hold off before I get into that.

In regards to your analogy, I don't think it's undisputed fact that fetuses can think and feel and do things that a ""person"" can do. Given the current state of knowledge, it would be like saying: 

Some boxes will have humans that are kept alive on life support, but they don't have a brain and aren't aware of anything. They wouldn't even feel pain when squished.

Tuala08,AskMen,1389378969.0,"Don't be sorry! I appreciate any insight people can give and this is really fascinating!
I am glad you also tried to come up with a word for diminishing someone's femininity! I study languages and I hate when the language I am using does not have a term for the idea I wish to express. 

I must admit I do find maintaining my appearance helps me feel feminine but to me that is just all in my mind... That sort of 'today I feel sexy though yesterday I didn't' when nothing actually changed from one day to the next.  To me it would compare to a guy hitting a boxing bag a bit to pump up your confidence, I shaved my legs and put on some perfume to do the same... but it's more of an additive thing.  Like I have a baseline femininity I am just helping it along in my own personal way and no one can make me go below baseline.

I have always rejected though the logic=men and emotion=female link.  Some of my exes were waaay more emotional than I will ever be and so many were lacking in even an ounce of logic that I simply cannot imagine how this link came to be.  To me it is more of a personality/upbringing thing. My personality (if we use myers briggs) means I value emotion however I was brought up to think logic is better so I often have to struggle to reconcile the two but I think I have a fairly good balance. I also think that has a lot to do to with maturity, I generally feel that men who cannot express their emotions are all are rather immature.  Society needs to figure out that a balance is best, over relying on one or the other doesn't get us anywhere.

&gt; A man may give a person power to emasculate them as a form of trust.

What  I think I am aiming for here is that we instead say A person gives another person power to hurt them as a form of trust.  We all have to open up and be vulnerable and it's scary and its giving the other person some kind of power over us, but it doesn't have to be tied to your sense of being a man.

I dont think though that people assume I am feminine because I am a woman.  I honestly don't think anyone has ever assumed I was a very feminine/girly person (by traditional definitions of it). I come across as commanding, independent, sometimes scary, forward person. People are often surprised to learn I like cutesy things like sparkles.  I do hate that women have to somehow validate that they can be powerful and a woman at the same time. My definition of femininity IS powerful. "

Personally I (and many others) would not recommend mining on a laptop as they tend to overheat quite quickly when mining and running laptops at high temps for long periods of time isn't the best. But if you do decide to do it then it all depends on your hash rate. Right now your hash rate is more or less what you get during 1 hour worth of mining. So lets say that whatever laptop you have can churn out 50kh/s and that you then sleep 9 hours a day, 9x50x7=3150 doge for a week worth of mining.

dsklerm,AskWomen,1389379043.0,"I'm going to kind of ignore the issues related to gender assumptions (boys mature slower!) and just focus on the main issue to me, when it comes to significant age differences especially related to the 18-22/23 range. I really think those are very formative years, and I think unless it's with someone your exceptionally compatable with (and their exceptionally mature) it's harder.  when I was 23 I dated this 18 year old for a few months and it was just... Awful.  I don't think her age was the main reason why it didn't work we both were pretty broken.  But the issues of compatability run deeper than ""she thought the Simpsons were dumb and liked family guy instead.""   Activities we could do together were limited, but so priorities in life were different, what we were looking for in each other too.  We just were in such different places.  I would never say ""it'll never work"" but I think between legal drinking, living on your own, and college/entering the workforce it's just a crazy time in a persons life, and it's hard for people outside of that age range to date someone going through all that.  

I say this of course at the age of 27.   About two weeks ago I took a 21 year old out for dinner and drinks, and while obviously the age difference is greater than my ex, talking with her I am already noticing more is relatable. Sure just like my ex she doesn't know about those great Simpsons years... And sure she may prefer to go to a club instead of a pub. But were just *closer* to the same place in life.

Buick88,AskReddit,1389379086.0,"This may be buried, I'm a bit late to the party, but the question and the spirit of the inquiry made me too excited to care. 

I came to religion later in life, and it is not the faith of my family nor any of my close friends. I simply found what resonates with me. I am religious because I believe it encourages a kind of discipline that I find helpful and fulfilling. My meditations on the divine motivate me to both improve my own life and spur me to serve others. I acknowledge that this is fully possible without religion; I'm just doing what works for me. I also like having exemplars whose example I can aspire to, and religion gives me that. 
I am also an avid student of multiple religions. While of course this exposes me to cross-links/evidence of the more human origins of religion, it hasn't diminished my faith. I think religion is a way of responding to something that (given the ubiquity of religion) many people ponder and work with: the nature of the universe and its mysteries, the way to live well, etc. (again, wholly possible without religion, too). I delight in seeing the many paths to what I tend to conceive of as a single goal: ""hierophany,"" Mircea Eliade's term for manifestations of the divine. "

My sister gave me this book because she suspected HFA in me for years and wanted to get me on the road to further self-discovery.  She is by far the brightest and best of my family, a youth librarian, one of my best friends who knows me better than anyone else in the family.

* To set a text tag, you use the same user interface as for the coloured tags: File | Tags...  then either type in the name (if you haven't used it before) or select from the list. Alternatively use File | Info. Most importantly, you can set more than one tag (even if it's a coloured tag!). So I might have a file tagged as **bike**, **electrics**. For me, this is the great advantage over plain folders - although MacOS's Unix foundations does allow a file to be in more than one directory, it's not easily accessible from the UI, and there is no way of searching for a file on this basis.

* To use a tag as a search term for the **bike** tag in Spotlight without it being confused with the name or contents of a file, use the search term **tag:bike**. This is probably well-documented somewhere, but I haven't seen it."

Until then, we need to keep convincing men that they need to work themselves to death.  We do that by telling them they have to do it for their wives and children, and that they aren't men if they complain.

Anyways, it bugs the shit out of me that I'd be considered a ""good"" overweight person because I'm steadily losing weight. Fuck off, I don't want their approval. I do this for me -- it's my decision, my months of effort. Their decision to be assholes and spread shame on the internet contributed *less than nothing* to my decision to get in shape.

I hate the way some people judge fat people when we ""shape up"" and start to ""behave."" Like their shame had anything to do with my decision to improve my life. Nah, it had to do with the people that love me unconditionally, even when I was obese, that made me feel good enough and empowered enough to treat my anxiety medically and kick my sugar addiction for good.

So, this time Radio France didn't want to let it slide, and tried to prosecute him. I guess it took off and that the minister in question thought that it would be good PR to help them get justice by bumping the procedures.

Personally I am all for these anti-hate speech law. He said in one of his show, which are actually more like gathering for a fringe militant base of mostly everything extreme-right, that he regretted that he couldn't kill a journalist who was getting back at him and reporting on his behavior.

McLarenF1God,AskWomen,1389379581.0,"Yes, of course. Most people take a non-extremist view that is as much an equal rights perspective as it is gender specific. Often when people think of feminism, they think of this annoying extremist worldview, when it actually boils down to fair and equal treatment in the workplace, freedom in daily life where the role as a female isn't defined by societal expectations, and control over their own bodies without childish sexual discrimination by other women and men. With that said, these are not the things I think of when I hear the word. The term as spoken still leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and I'd rather let my actions speak for themselves. It's the same reason I don't identify as liberal or conservative. I find the further you go on either end of that spectrum, the more annoying and cliche the viewpoint becomes. I simply have my own opinions on the matter, that may move a bit either direction, but never to an extreme. I may qualify as a feminist, which is a liberal viewpoint, but I will absolutely not describe myself as a liberal feminist. That sounds like a thoroughly unappealing selling point, so I explain myself in a way that avoids this negative image.

And I am very thankful to him for it.


But heres the thing. I shouldn't have to worry about being attacked or raped every time I leave the house. He shouldn't have to be afraid to let me walk to my car in the driveway by myself after dark or to insist I not get gas after dark unless he's with me. I shouldn't have to take precautions like this because, as OP said, men do have critical thinking skills and rape shouldn't be such a prevalent thing. I've been raped. And of anyone tried to rape me again they'd be bleeding out at my feet in ten minutes flat. Unfortunately I had to learn to protect myself, because I learned the hard way that it's often men that won't take responsibility for their own actions.

robinhoode,BitcoinSerious,1389379795.0,"&gt; Well, your proposal is impossible. ""Knowing"" the pool size is impossible and unenforceable.

At the moment it's impossible because the pools are external to the protocol. Is it possible to make them internal to the protocol, and, even better, broadcast the size of the pools to the rest of the network?

&gt; The only good samaritans required are the ones writing the mining software.

It sounds like this is a small number. And it also seems like the ones that control the pools have a fair amount of power as well.

&gt; People aren't flocking to GHash.io so much as not bothering to change the default pool away from it on their new hardware.

I wasn't aware of this. Thanks.

&gt; Changing the defaults to use tools like P2Pool and getblocktemplate will help reduce the power wielded by large pool operators.

Right, but what I'm suggesting is that we not rely on the kindness of miners to move to other pools. I'm suggesting we make it a part of the protocol that it is actually more profitable to move to other pools, or better pools. All of this is very nebulous in my head, so I appreciate that someone will counter my statements to help solidify it."

SublethalDose,socialskills,1389379801.0,"&gt; make the other person feel inferior or submissive to you

I think this is the wrong way for OP to go.  For whatever reason, a lot of people with confidence issues, especially people with a history of social humiliation, see superiority as more achievable than equality.  They shoot for superiority but end up flip-flopping back and forth between feeling above other people (the feeling they try to generate from within) and feeling below them (the reality of their past and possibly ongoing treatment asserting itself.)  Imagining oneself as equal seems to be psychologically much harder than imagining the hierarchy being inverted.  However, in practice, trying to achieve equal status as a respected person is much more likely to succeed, much healthier, and much less likely to make everyone around you think you're a deluded douchebag.

The worst thing about being stuck in the inferiority/superiority mindset is that when people try to be friends with you and try to relate to you on terms of equality, you'll go crazy trying to figure out who is ""above"" the other person.  Their teasing will make you paranoid; your teasing will be too aggressive.  It will be hard not to poison the relationship.  "

I realized immediately afterwards the mistake I made. This was over 2 years ago and I'm still not over it. I made moves after that night, but that was it, I missed my chance. We're now good friends, but not sure how long it's gonna last though since I still like her and everyone knows that kind of thing falls apart eventually.

Move out, start making your own decisions. We grow up trusting that our parent's know what is best for us, but at a certain point we start to understand that they don't really know, and even worse, it sounds like your parents are living in a world that doesn't exist anymore and are trying to set you up to be a brood mare for the son of a family of higher social status in order to advance the family because ""My parents are just looking for the best customer before I become backdated (age past 26)""

Let me tell you, unless you and your arranged husband move back to asia (and maybe that's his plan), things don't generally work like that in North America.

I know you are worried about disappointing your family, but at a certain point they will all be gone and it will just be you living with the consequences of their decisions, unhappy and isolated. When this marriage happens you will not have any of the family you are sacrificing for anymore, you will be removed from them, taken away and alone. So think long and hard before deciding that you are making this decision for them.

The one person I think you are most at risk of betraying right now is yourself, and you are the only one that will have to live with the consequences of that for the rest of your life.

Set your wishful thinking aside, If you go through with this marriage you will most likely be unhappy. You don'e even know this boy, for all you know he is abusive and is just putting on a kind face until you are married and you are truly trapped. You need to make whatever decision you make for you. You need to take responsibility for your life and make your own decision or you may as well be a sack of flour being sold from one person to another."

Protip: NP's ult does more damage with each successive bounce, and the starting point can be targeted. Target something on the opposite end of the map of which the fight is occurring to inflict maximum damage to the enemy players.

Edit: Don't take ""NP doesn't contribute anything to teamfights"" as ""never engage the enemy"". While NP doesn't contribute much of anything during a teamfight besides his ult, he's useful for picking off fleeing heroes."

B. Writing isn't a hard science, and sometimes for fun phrases can be used which might not apply to reality, but which may apply to a fictional universe wherein there is some property allowing a kind of 'negative kelvin', i.e. like a black hole sucks up light, maybe some kind of 'black hole for heat' which can draw in so much warm it's effectively in the temperature negative.

It fits Ursa's kit decently well too, since ~~s~~he's an AGI hero that benefits from STR (from ulti) and she can certainly use the speed.  But again, might be better off with a blink dagger and go straight for heart or something like that.  

You CAN disassemble them and turn them into Manta Style + Heaven's Halberd later, but I honestly almost never see that done.  

It's not BAD on anybody, but there may be other items that are more cost effecient -- you might be better with Linken's, or Manta Style, or Heaven's Halberd, or whatever.  

It's generally considered a noob item... Not necessarily bad, but since it has no active ability, it's fairly low, long-term impact rather than having the ability to change the course of the teamfight like a Scythe of Vyse or Abyssal blade, etc.  "

JackPAnderson,BDSMcommunity,1389380094.0,"Hopefully you'll indulge me a bit of amusement with an irony of modern feminism. In pursuit of the worthy goal of freeing yourself from the yoke of your parents' and your priest's backward notions about sex being dirty, sinful, and only for procreation so that you could enjoy sex for its own sake and have the sex that *you* want to have, you gained a new yoke, put on you by none other than your Women's Studies professors! You just got slutshamed by them for wanting what they call ""degrading"", anti-feminist sex (assuming that you indeed want that)! 

OK, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about you and your boyfriend. As for whether he's a closet misogynist, I'd say: probably not. From what you've described, he respects you and your agency and your right not to like BDSM. Obviously you need to pay attention to his actions, as you would anybody's actions, but like I said, it sounds like he respects you and your wishes. Does he respect you outside of the bedroom? I'll just assume that the answer is ""yes"" since you're still together, but anyway, that's important. 

Regarding feeling like a prude, that's on you. You know what you like and what you don't like, so just own it and don't let anyone make you feel like you're a prude for not liking one thing or a slut for liking some other thing. People can say what they want to say, but you control how you react to it. 

Unfortunately, I can't tell you whether or not you'd enjoy submitting to him. If you ignore the feminism angle and just fantasize about it for its own sake, does that make you horny? If so, you can proceed slowly, and with caution, always making sure that he respects your limits. 

If it just doesn't make you horny at all, then you have your answer, at least for now. Desires sometimes change, of course, but neither of you can count on it. 

And I'm just going to say this: if he is kinky and you are not, that probably means that your relationship has an expiration date attached to it, unless you come up with some ""creative"" solutions. 

Good luck! "

Note: 

- Last minute concession from the Germans that disarming the warships had to happen in French African ports - not in France.  This would have likely made the terms acceptable to the British.

- As early as June 20th, Darlan had sent a coded order to the captains of the warships based in French African ports - do not surrender your ships intact to the Germans. On June 24th, he repeated this order with specific instructions to make preparations to scuttle the ships if it seemed likely that they would be captured. The British were unaware of this instruction and on June 27th the British government took the decision that the French ships could not be allowed to fall into the hands of the Germans and that the Royal Navy would ensure that this would not happen.

- Records show that the French Admiral only told the French Government of only one of the British ultimatums - that the fleet would be destroyed within six hours - the other choices were never relayed. "

Your perspective is interesting for me as well.

I think I agree that it would be different if I had some kind of large inheritance coming my way, or one of us made significantly more, or had a large amount of debt, but:

I make about 35k, he makes about 45k. 

He owes 12k on a car he bought new last year, I have a paid for used car from '99.

Both of us had family support and ended up graduating college with no student loans.

Our parents are in good health, and even if something was to happen to any of them, there isn't any massive amount of financial gain for either of us.

Anyway, I'm the one in our relationship who has been advocating for a joint account.

It would be so much easier for us both to contribute to a joint account and have all our joint expenses pulled from there, than to try to evenly split the many, many expenses. To list a few:

* Groceries: Costco, Trader Joe's, etc.

* Toiletries: Paper towels, tooth paste, shampoo, toilet paper, laundry detergent

* Laundry: About $40 in quarters one of us has to pull every month or so

* Rent: We currently each pay half separately.

* Utilities

* Internet

* Gas - for when we commute together or go on longer trips

It's just... Old. I love him and I'm tired of having finances and talking about who last paid for what. It's not that either of us cares - or is worried about the other not contributing enough, it's that each of us cares that the other thinks WE have contributed enough (if that makes sense).

Anyway, you're cool. Thanks."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1389380168.0,"Depends on what you mean by racism. Institutional? Very rarely. If we go by colloquial racism, undoubtedly happens a lot more often.

Still, the problem is that 90% of those instances are going to be interesting and maybe even news-worthy precisely because how very not mundane they are. As in that's not how racism usually works. Which is why I originally meant by

&gt;""yo, does this really fucking matter, in the grand scheme of shit that is racist?""

For instances of racism against white people to become a thing real people need to take seriously (other than isolated instances where anyone can both recognize harm *and* the rarity of the event), the very fabric of society itself would have to change. In other words, white people would not have disproportionate control of every single institution of power, and today's instances of oppression of minorities would fail to manifest in incredibly predictable ways today that echo historical oppression that everyone knows about (if they aren't incredibly stupid or some flavor of bigot, like a White Supremacist).

So what happens is that people in that thread are going from ""this isn't evidence of institutional racism, in all probability"" and making the assumption that ""this isn't racist at all"" and *then* people are making the assumption that they're implying that no harm was done.

And everyone is mad."

sockalicious,personalfinance,1389380264.0,"You've had other opinions, but here's mine:

It doesn't make sense to try to buy a house if you're going to want to sell it in 3 years.  It costs a lot to buy a house - inspections, appraisals, mortgage origination fees, title check, document prep fees; moving costs; etc.; and it costs a lot to sell a house: renovations, staging, seller's agent's commission, buyer's agent's commission, more document fees; time spent readying and showing the house; moving costs; storage costs; etc.  It's really tough to recoup those costs in 3 years.

Also, a house in 'fairly good condition' with 'no major problems' is that way right up until it develops a major problem - subsidence, or roof leak, or termites, or whatever.  If you're renting you just move somewhere else.  If you own the place you have to fix it.  You don't really get a choice.  Even routine maintenance on a run of the mill house will cost you well more than $150 a month.  I don't know, of course, but I'm suspecting that you're neglecting things like fire/hazard insurance, property taxes, landscaping and tree surgery, the occasional plumbing or electrical odd job that always pops up, and other stuff that everyone who's ever owned a home knows is an eternal drain on the bank account.

You've not mentioned anything about tax consequences - I mean your income tax - of buying a home vs. renting.  This varies from place to place.  You should really give this some thought because it can affect the financial impact quite a bit.

With regard to buying a house, then 3 years later renting it out and moving away - really?  If you bought a $150,000 Lamborghini, would you hand the keys to a dude, say ""please send me $600 a month, and I want it back in good shape when you're done"" and then move to another state?  No?  Then why would you even consider doing the same with a $150,000 house?  Seriously, being a landlord is a job; and being an absentee landlord is a way of taking a job and then not doing the work of that job.  It's a recipe for getting burned unless you know exactly what you're doing, and I don't think you do.  You'd end up doing public service - you'd most likely be paying for the privilege of hosting a series of deadbeats in a house that used to be nice before they ruined it.

With regard to IBM stock, it's a separate issue.  I wouldn't hold more than 5% of my entire investment holdings in a single stock, no matter how good it was.  That's because I can be wrong and stocks - really good, 100-year-history companies - can go to zero.  (Thanks, GM!)

I also tend to feel that taxes shouldn't make much of a difference in decisions about buying, holding and selling stock.  You buy a stock or hold a stock because you think the stock and the company will be worth more in the future.  You sell a stock whenever you don't think so.  It's that simple.   If you don't have a strong opinion about those things  - and in the case of IBM, it's pretty hard to be an expert on everything they do, I'd certainly never volunteer an opinion - sell the stock, or at least most of it, and put the money elsewhere."

Thus seeing tons of millionaires and billionaires pop up makes sense. However, I think the real issue is money in politics. Wealthy people keep funding politicians at an unparralled rate. In return they draft laws that are anti-competitive. Do you know how expensive it is to start a business these days? It's really fucking expensive. I'm trying to open a store front, and just the licensing alone is going to run me 50k. That's not even factoring in all the regulatory compliance costs plus the other startup costs. It'll probably run 200K+ just to start when it shouldn't have been more than 20k. It seems like motto is deregulate and cut taxes for extremely wealthy industries, and only introduce regulation when it ensures it makes it harder for competition to enter the arena. Then, never deregulate the bottom, in fact, regulate the shit out of it, just to ensure that those with money are the only ones able to participate.

If Cech is willing to pass on the knowledge and experience he has gained, and help groom Courtois to play with the back line, it could work out well for both.

TheDukesMistress,personalfinance,1389380487.0,"This just seems like a lot of effort. What if you both knew what, approximately, your monthly expenses were, and you contributed about that much per month to a joint account. Then everything would be pulled from there, and you wouldn't have to track anything in google, send money via paypal, or ever feel like one person owes the other.

I understand that we're young and that joining our finances could end poorly. We're not talking about taking on each others' debt or anything. Neither us really has much debt. He owes 12k on a car he bought last year, we don't have any student loans, we rent an apartment, we both pay our credit card bills completely each month... 

We're talking about having an account that we can pull all of the boring, stupid expenses from so that we can equally share the burden rather than worrying about that equal-ness at the end of every month.

I'm not advocating this so that I can steal his money or something (not that you've suggested this, others have though). I just want to spend more time enjoying the things that we pay for and less time thinking about who paid for what...

yepimalady,introvert,1389380553.0,"&gt;Things were complicated because I am a bit older than her so we did decide to be friends based upon that.

OK...but then you say:
&gt;She wanted me to go to prom with her, and we talked about dating in the future. I was sure it was going to happen but it just seems like it fizzled out of no where. I wasn't even trying to be anything more than a friend at that point she just started being weird.

Uh....um....she didn't start being weird, that *is* weird.  I wouldn't talk to any guy that I was ""just friends with"" about going to prom and dating in the future.  It doesn't sound like you had a clear boundary of friendship vs. romantic intent with this girl (or her with you).

It sounds like the best idea at this point would be to just leave her alone -- she's not talking to you, you don't want to get hurt further; she wasn't your friend anyway, she was someone you hoped to date but couldn't/didn't because you were older and she wasn't interested.

This is a great example of what I said earlier: if you want lady-friends, you need to be friends with them first, not attempt to date them and then try for a friendship-consolation-prize.  It just doesn't really work that way.

But good luck in the future finding women that you want to just be friends with!"
rockspeak,weddingplanning,1389380556.0,"Personally, I don't take it personally that the wedding industry markets their products to the people who are most likely to purchase them.  Time and time again it's proven that brides make most of the decisions in most wedding planning, and thus they market to brides.  I think the above example is an extreme case of marketing with humor, and isn't meant to be taken as a personal attack on all grooms.  The example even starts ""if you are anything like him,"" which means they're aware that some grooms are not like their founder.

&gt;  especially since these people are looking to me to help them undermine him

That sounds pretty fucked up.  If I had the feeling that a vendor was trying to undermine my FHs opinions, I'd question using them.  If I felt like they just thought I was the decision maker, I would find it a mild annoyance and continue using their services.

I am the bride, and I am doing most of the leg work, then making decisions jointly with my fiance.  I am closer to the generalized market for wedding vendors, so I have no experienced the outrage you are experiencing.  

However, were I in a similar place as you, I would be direct and upfront, as I am a direct and upfront person.  I would simply tell a vendor (in person, on the phone, or via email) ""I feel as though you're ignoring my fiance's opinions, and as we're making these decisions together, it's important to me as a customer that you listen to us both.  I'm not interested in repeating my fiance's opinions after telling you my own:  I'm interested in you taking direction from us both and giving us options that will work the best for both of us.  I understand that the bride is traditionally the person you work with, but for our wedding we're doing the research and making decisions equally, and I'd appreciate it if you treated us with the same amount of attention and respect.  Thank you."""

Anyways, I didn't believe in Bitcoins, and I still am relatively hesitant. I understood the concept of bitcoins but I never thought they would go mainstream. I always thought they would either:

A) Be used for illegal activities
B) Used by a small group of people
C) Eventually die off like the beanie babies.

Bakuwoman,infj,1389380642.0,"I can't speak for all INFJ's obviously, but here is what I have concluded after discussing this with others for a while: if you look at the feeling functions (Fi and Fe) those can be a good indicator of whether someone is empathetic or sympathetic. My personal conclusion is individuals who utilize Fi are more likely to be empathetic while those who utilize Fe are more likely to be sympathetic.

These are the broad definitions I use when thinking of empathy verse sympathy:

Empathy: Attempting to put yourself in the other person's situation and feel what you conclude they must be feeling. Another approach is applying your own personal experiences/emotions to a situation to determine how the person is feeling. In these cases, some can say they are feeling just as strongly as the other.

Sympathy: Basing your reaction/interpretation of a situation on your understanding of the individual. Your emotional reaction (if there is one) is not how you imagine them to be feeling, but simply reacting to the situation as a whole based on your interpretation of events and the person/people involved.

Now those definitions can perhaps spark an entirely different debate, but I just wanted to present them so it is clear what I mean when I say empathy and sympathy. Anyway, I'll tackle Fi first. An individual who has Fi as a function will either have or seek a strong sense of ""self."" Most emotions felt will be intense because of this - especially for ESFP's who are Se-Fi meaning their already strong feelings are amplified by their strong physical sense of self. Therefore, when an Fi user hears or sees something that will cause an emotional response, it makes sense that their approach will be empathetic/self-centered. Now I am not using that as an insult! I simply mean from their own principles, experiences, and overall feelings about the situation at hand. For an Fi individual, this approach results in a strong feeling of connection with the other person. Now I could expand on this a bit more, but I'm at work so maybe will edit it later xp! All I will say for now is empathy as a way of connecting with others is a very powerful and positive thing when done correctly. Regardless of functions, many people respond in a positive way to empathy.

Next it's time for Fe and sympathy. Fe as a function is about nurturing relationships by validating and valuing others. In order to do that, many Fe users will naturally try to understand others. This can be done in both a positive and negative way, but I think the evils/downsides of Fe can be saved for another topic. The point is, because of this tendency of Fe users to focus more on understanding others over themselves it makes sense that they will react to an event with sympathy over empathy. Now, this doesn't mean that an Fe user will always be right about their interpretation of how the other person/people feel, but their intention will be to try and grasp that verse placing themselves in the situation.

Example: The most recent episode of Elder's React covered the story about a man's wife who died of cancer a few years ago. Before she died, she wrote a letter and gave it to a friend with these instructions: When he gets engaged please send this to the radio station that fulfills Christmas wishes every year. The letter explained how she was happy he moved on and thanked the new woman in his life who chose to marry him. She made wishes for the family, new wife-to-be, and hospital staff. Obviously this caused strong feelings for many who heard this.

Empathy: One person reacting in particular deeply connected with the story because she lost her mom to cancer at age 15. She discussed how hard it is to suffer that lose, and referenced how close she was to her mother. For those watching her reaction that have gone through a similar experience, I am sure they felt a deep sense of connection and perhaps sadness when watching/listening to her reaction.

Sympathy: Another person throughout the video seemed to be trying to comprehend the deceased wife as an individual, and by the end said ""I wish I knew her as a person"" and was shedding tears. Clearly she felt a connection with that person, but it was focused around feeling as if she ""knows her"" verse trying to relate her own experiences.

This may not be a perfect example to some (especially since the people aren't typed or anything). My main point with this example though is both approaches result in feeling connection. One seems to come from a strong sense of self (Fi) while the other seems to come from a sense of ""knowing the other person"" through hearing the story (Fe).

fuckingchris,AskReddit,1389380673.0,"No, but can free will exist in a world engineered to the wishes of a being beyond the rules of mortality? I personally am an agnostic of the ""I dont care,"" kind, but if such a god did exist, whatever they said would be moral since they engineered the concept of morality, along with the processes that led a colony of chemical bundles known as life to develop the faculties necessary to invent a concept of objective morality.

What I'm saying is that if the CORE of all things wants you to rape children and murder strangers, to go against its will is to be, in essence, evil. Liberty, justice, want, and desire mean nothing in the face of a being in complete control. We would be no more than lines of computer code to such a thing. 

If the being was lying about being a god, then I have no doubt many people would attempt to discover the truth. If the being can shape reality to its will, then is there a difference?

funkymunniez,boston,1389380680.0,"I know exactly what was stated and once again, its disingenuous to state that brady is the worst qb left in the playoffs using metric based on regular season performance.  Regular season performance has never been a strong indicator of post season success regardless of what numbers the qb has posted.  Peyton Manning is a perfect example of this, racking up more NFL MVP awards than most any other qb has in the past decade but has had something like 9 one and done performances in all his playoff appearances.  The guy fucking sucks in the post season...sure has a shot every year, but if you were going to pick who you wanted to lead your post season team to the superbowl, Manning does not top that list.

The best metric for post season performance has, and always will be post season record over career, and where the losses happened.  Philip Rivers, never made it to the Bowl.  Manning, 9 times hes been one and done.  Luck, too small of a sample size but still sitting at 0-1.  Brady, 5 bowl appearances, 5-2 in the AFC championship, 17-7 in the post season, the only qb in the AFC right now with a winning record in the post season.  And all of this to state that the article posted used some pretty subjective qualifiers as to who is the best.

And by the way, you can't state in one breath that the Patriots as a *team* went 17-7 in the playoffs and then in the other say that Brady went 7-6 since 2006 in the playoffs.  Hypocracy much?"

For me I'd rather less options, but better quality. 

The best meal I had was at a dinner theatre type thing in a hotel (One night only) and it was a rolled pork loin and rice and veggies. Food came out quick, hot and their really talented chef made it just plain awesome(despite, apparently, being delivered the wrong type of pork). They sold out (180 odd tickets) and everyone was very satisfied with the meal and got their food quickly.

ctesibius,askscience,1389380981.0,"Technical and economic reasons are not entirely separable, but here's a few of the more technical ones.

* Wing area: if you look at the size of even a small aeroplane, the wings are quite large. These would have to be folded out of the way in such a way that they don't block vision, don't adversely affect the aerodynamics of the car, and are reasonably durable in the folded position.

* Usability: car drivers have no training for planning safe routes in a 3D space shared with other traffic and weather systems. Pilots do, but if you restrict the market to qualified pilots, you remove most of your potential customers. So you start having to look at high level routing control systems, rather than low level controls which just make the controls work without stalling the aircraft. This is hard, and getting approval for such an autonomous system faces similar difficulties to those faced by Google's driverless cars.

* Durability in general: a car is sufficiently robustly built that it will stand being bounced down roads of variable quality for perhaps 100k miles, and then can be repaired to continue its work. It can withstand a certain amount of crash damage without affecting its functionality, and can be reasonably easily repaired from more serious damage. All of this robustness comes at the expense of weight.

* Power requirements: a car engine requires fairly low levels of power to cruise at up 90 mph, but must run on pump fuel and work at revs and power settings which may vary continuously over a wide range. A flying car engine requires more than 2.5x the power to cruise at 150mph, but can run at a constant power setting for long periods and has no need of the flexibility of a car engine. There is a stronger requirement for the flying car engine not to fail in flight - for instance it is normal to have dual independent ignition systems and to check manually that both of these are working before take-off. It is possible to make an engine to satisfy both requirements, but expensive.

* Aerodynamics: a light plane is quite cramped inside and has little luggage space. This would not be acceptable for an expensive car for most users.

* Fail-safe: while a car is not fail safe in all respects (you can't swing the wheel hard over on the motorway without suffering the consequences), in many respects it is. Forget to put in petrol, or fail to top up the oil, and the engine will stop. For a flying car to reach this level of safety, it needs things like a large automatically deployed parachute, with the matching control systems - and even then it will not be as safe as a car. The level of intrinsic safety of a light aeroplane is not enough if you want this to be a car replacement.

I think that pretty much sums it up.  I was raised in a non-denominational, charismatic Christian faith, starting about 5 years old.  I believed everything I was taught, up to about 25 years of age (I was even a youth/teen associate pastor).  

Due to some personal issues, I started questioning the faith as I wasn't being ""healed"".  I couldn't help but start asking those difficult questions.  I looked into Buddhism, first, then started comparing the most popular faiths and dogmas.

It ended up being a two-year process as I struggled with everything, but eventually I realized I just didn't believe anymore.  I think it was another two-year effort to get my mother to accept it, but she has, though she says she still prays for me.

I think Jesus was a decent enough guy, very Buddhist if you think about it.  All he ever really taught was, ""Don't be a jerk.  If you have extra, share it.  Help others when you're able."""

And my answers didn't fit with what this woman was expecting to hear, I didn't believe that homosexuality is a choice or something that can be controlled or ""corrected"" because it doesn't need to be. And I didn't follow the same belief that abortion is terrible and the women who make that choice are going to go to hell and should be shamed publicly.

The link between obesity/hyperactivity and soft drinks is not sugar, but BPA.  This is the confounding factor that very few studies have controlled for, but virtually all canned soda drinks are lined with BPA.  A few sample studies (there are many more if you do a search on PubMed):

* Abnormal synaptic plasticity in basolateral amygdala may account for hyperactivity and attention-deficit in male rat exposed perinatally to low-dose bisphenol-A. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21277317

* Plastics derived endocrine disruptors (BPA, DEHP and DBP) induce epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of obesity, reproductive disease and sperm epimutations. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23359474

I also picked out Sanchez because he`s the most glaring example of why QBR is not a good metric.  If the author of the article wanted to make the statement that Brady had the worst regular season out of the remaining playoff QB's then there is no issue.

I thought ""great! this girl is texting me first, she's gotta be into me."" 

We talked through New Years Eve and through New Years day last week. Friday came around and I straight up asked her if she was busy that night, that's when she said she was leaving. I said that was too bad and that I wanted to take her to the new Movie Bistro we had talked about to watch American Hustle. I haven't received a text back since.

Religious texts are filled with messages and life lessons told in story format. I think this is because good, simple advice can have more of an impact if there is an epic tale spun around it.

I don't see in any way how many of the things in the stories could be possible though, so I don't believe it literally. It's like Lord of the Rings, there are so many great lessons in those stories but they are obviously not real settings. Just take what you can from it and apply it to your life.

RememberToBackupData,GradSchool,1389381236.0,"I got a Transformer last week. Sadly, being in Australia, I got shafted for the price. 

Anyway, thoughts:

1. ASUS wasted their time putting such a garbage trackpad on a touch device. They should have had the cojones to skip the trackpad altogether if they couldn't do a good job of it in the first place; it would have allowed them to make the keyboard larger, and solved two of the most common complaints levelled against the Transformer.
2. Having Windows on a touch tablet is really cool. I've made it as similar to Windows 7 as possible, so it's just merged into my workflow. Desktop programs can be controlled just fine with touch in most cases, although I have trouble with scrollbars for apps that don't support content touch scrolling (like Evernote note contents).
3. I've always read papers on tablets (previously a Nexus 7), so reading papers here works just fine. One issue is that text becomes a bit fuzzier in portrait mode because the screen resolution is pretty low (768 x 1366 in portrait), but it's still very usable.
4. I've begun retrofitting my old productivity apps for touchscreen use where necessary. I've made an overlay that allows me to select tools, highlight passages, and scroll through PDFs in Adobe Reader by touching buttons, for example. Having that kind of extendability in a tablet is *awesome*."

Remember that you both made vows, not just you, and there comes a certain point where it becomes clear that the honoring, cherishing, and faithfulness are only going one way, and when i say faithfulness I don't just mean sex, in your case it is clear that he is more important to himself than you are. It isn't even a matter of balance anymore, he is always more important.

After I divorced my ex after she cheated on me, I wasn't there to save her anymore. She slept around, she went off her meds, she lived in her car, she got kicked out of her pastor's house, and eventually got so sick of living with her own shit that she got a decent job, got an apartment, found a doctor who helped her find the right meds, and finally got a Master's degree.

As long as I was there to catch her, she never got tired of falling. Once falling meant she had to hit the ground with no one to catch her, she learned to catch herself.

At a certain point you need to say enough is enough, you need to give yourself the respect you have been sacrificing for him, he isn't reciprocating it back. And finally, eventually you have to stop catching him and let him learn the hard way, since the easy way hasn't been working.

peolerson,AskReddit,1389381409.0,"I am agnostic because I don't like religion, but I'm not really counting anything out either.

I don't like religion because I think it breeds arrogance in humans, especially Christianity (""I'm special because Jesus says so!"" ""We're God's *chosen* people!"") I know not all Christians are like this but that's largely the mentality that I've encountered. I also think religion is largely a security blanket for people who are scared to die. 

If there is a judgment and an afterlife, and if I have lived a life of goodness and honesty, then I have nothing to worry about. If there isn't a judgment/afterlife, then I won't be around to experience it, so who cares?

I have a lot of respect for world religions and spiritualities, but I feel like I'm limiting myself if I zero in on just one. Religion is cool, but I like being an observer instead of a participator.

Edit: I grew up Presbyterian and attended 3 years of Catholic school, which efficiently crushed any interest I had in Christianity whatsoever."

My breasts sit pretty high up on my torso, so I think that might have something to do with it, at least for me. But as long as the bands are comfortable, I don't see a problem. I think you're correct that the bras with open tops and vertical seams - half cups - work better on you than the others.

Things to consider: do the underwires sit directly under your breasts or do they sink down? In the Cleo Juna, is the lace sitting flush against your skin or is it a little loose? If it's loose, it fits properly. If it sits flush, it's too small. I can't tell in the pictures. I think the Bravissimo Hearts Amour bra is too small in the cup and is smooshing your breast tissue upwards, making you look flat chested. 

Hope that helps.

*I must say, If I ever get back to England (I'm in the states), I'm going to Bravissimo. I have one bra from them that I ordered in the Spring, and I think it's my best fitting bra. The Bravissimo brand half cups that you've got on are so pretty. I love the Sweet Bon Bon one!"

The knowledge that all bad things will be made right, you will live forever and you will be reunited with everyone you ever lost. How wonderful. Who could deny another that state of bliss?

Do you know how many times I've gone to work and people say I look tired? So putting on makeup hides your look of tiredness.

I think saying ""We have 1 seat reserved in your honor"" is totally tactful way to say ""You get no +1.""  If someone wants to bring a +1, they're likely to ask you or someone else (your MOH for example) if it's OK.  By then you're likely to know if you have some RSVP-nos and can fit in that one person.  If you can swing it, tell them yes!  If not, tell them no.  If someone asks after you've reached your cut off point for guests, it's not like you personally singled them out:  At the time they asked you about a +1, you literally could not fit one more person, so you had to say no, and you shouldn't feel bad about that at all.

Alternatively, you could wait to see if you have enough RSVP-nos to invite some of those friends who you had to cut from the first round of invites.  This would be a more strict ""NO"" when people ask about +1s, because you run more of a risk of over-seating, but explaining that you physically don't have room still shouldn't make you feel bad.

I WISH I had only 7 +1s to worry about, OP!  I have 23 just on my A list (and a B list of 40 people)."

Going off of Effexor has been really difficult for me because your body starts to go into withdrawal, which affected my mood and concentration severely. At the moment, I am at the final dose where I can start to not take it anymore but I will most likely go into withdrawal again once I take that last step.

IsNotACleverMan,nfl,1389381764.0,"1. Datone Jones, DE, first round (26th overall): He was drafted to fulfill a role that's very hard to play. I think expectation should be kept low because of that. He flashed some ability, such as against the Eagles and in other games. He was losing out on playing time but I think part of his problem was supporting cast. He needs somebody to help him out on the interior. I think he can beat single teams but he needs to finish better. 
C

2. Eddie Lacy, RB, second round (61): He's a monster. With an average run-blocking offensive line, he was the 8th best RB. If you factor in that he really only got going in Week 5 (after the bye week), he was 2nd or 3rd. He carried the team on his back (and sometimes carried the other team too) when Rodgers was out. He was a steal.
A+

3. David Bakhtiari, T, fourth round (109): For an undersized LT who was determined to be the starter on August 3rd, he did remarkably well. He needs to cut down on his penalties, which are mainly due to him being overwhelmed by some of the bigger pass rushers in the league. With another off-season under his belt, he'll be much, much better.
B

4. J.C. Tretter, G/T, fourth round (122): He got hurt so we never got to see him play. He was supposed to be a backup center, but that never happened.
N/A

5. Johnathan Franklin, RB, fourth round (125): A speed back as opposed to Lacy's pounding style, he was supposed to be a complement. He did well with that until his fumble against the Bengals. With the re-emergence of Starks and the imminent return of Harris, not sure how much he's needed, especially with his mechanics being subpar.
C-

6. Micah Hyde, CB, fifth round (159): Great pick. Was a college star but didn't have the speed most people like with a CB so he fell in the draft. After Casey Heyward's injury, he was inserted as slot CB in the Nickel. He's shown lots of ability, although his speed is sometimes an issue. He's a great PR, even with our terrible Special Teams. Has lots of potential for growth, especially if he can get just a bit faster.
B+

7. Josh Boyd, DE, fifth round (167): Good depth pick. He's a big bodied guy meant to help up front. He seemed to get off to a slow start without much playing time but, after Jolly got hurt, he got more and more time playing where he showed flashes of ability and the opportunity to get better.
B-

8. Nate Palmer, OLB, sixth round (193): Not sure why we keep drafting 4-3 DEs to convert to 3-4 OLBs but here's another one. A pure depth pick, he got some playing time with all of the injuries we had. He showed some ability but I don't think he's starter material. He'll definitely be a good Special Teamer though.
C-

9+10: Charles Johnson, WR, seventh round (216) and Kevin Dorsey, WR, seventh round (224): Both are lumped together because we saw what neither of them could do. Both were hurt early in training camp but the word is that both were extremely raw prospects with good physical skills. Johnson got signed by the Browns where he failed his physical since he had a torn ACL (you think you would know if you had one, right?) and Dorsey has been on IR all season.
N/A

11. Sam Barrington, LB, seventh round (232): More linebacker depth/Special Teamer. Has a good eye for the ball but I can't see him being more than a Special Teamer/emergency depth.

If I had to suggest something though, it'd be two hydrometers and a hydrometer sample tube. Always keep two hydrometers, because they're fragile as hell.

And for the record, if you're somewhat quick and coordinated, you can start a siphon with just the tubing.

Edit: Well, also requires no-rinse sanitizer like StarSan.

* Sanitize everything as usual.

* Put your new vessel in a 5 gallon bucket or similar container. Put both of these below your full vessel.

* Fill the hose with sanitizer. Hold it at both ends so it forms a U shape. Let out a little so that you have just enough empty tube to lower the end of it into your mead without dumping in sanitizer. Do so.

* Lower the other end into the bucket, dumping the remaining sanitizer. You'll have to do the next part quickly as the siphon kicks into action. After the sanitizer runs into the bucket, which will be very very rapidly, stick the tube into your new vessel and watch the mead flow."

jaynay1,pokemon,1389381833.0,"Huh?

That's almost exactly backwards.

Tiers tell you how popular a pokemon is.  While this occasionally has a correlation with strength in terms of base stats, there are plenty of lower tier pokemon that are strong.

Ditto was NU last gen but is arguably the best revenge killer in the game (Although let's be honest it can be played around if you know what you're doing).

Quagsire was RU last gen but has a niche with Unaware as an anti-boosting sweeper wall.

There's a guy on /r/Stunfisk who is a big fan of Alomomola as a Regenerator wall/Wish Passer with good reason.  It's pretty strong, and yet it was NU.

Tiers aren't just a popularity contest, they're exactly a popularity contest.  Some pokemon are used more often because they're powerful, but if you're only looking through OU for your team then you'll end up with a poor team."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389381874.0,"I mean that doing back-breaking construction or heavy labor jobs is ruinous on the body, it leaves you with aching muscles and tired joints.  It grinds you down and wears you out.

90% of all workplace deaths are male deaths, because if there is dangerous, deadly work being done, men are doing it.  Men live shorter lives than women, because they do more damage to their bodies and place themselves under more stress.  Men are as likely as women to suffer depression, but 1/10th as likely to seek help.  Men commit suicide at 7 times the rate women do.  

And men are far more violent than women, and violence is the primary way men express the rage brought on by living lives full of despair.  This is why the gunman who kills others and forces the police to kill him is a male archtype.  That's an extreme, of course, but men are *cruel* to each other in all kinds of ways.  Feminists like to go on and on about the violence men inflict on women, but that's nothing.  That's just *spillover*.  Men are so much more violent towards men than they are towards women.

The role men play in society is not all bread and roses.  It really sucks being a man, and you're really not allowed to talk about it or show that you're suffering.  Being a man means not complaining about your lot in life, so if you complain you're seen as less of a man.

The reason men do it, the reason they get up in the morning and put themselves through all the degradation and pain, and keep doing it day after day, even as it leaves them emotional crippled and leads them to an early grave, is because of women and children.  It's because we raise men to feel a duty and an obligation to grind themselves down to protect women and children from being ground down.

Or I could just quote Henry David Thoreau:
&gt;“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.”"

If you're in the US and you somehow have decided that both sexes loathe and despise men who aren't constantly seeking to dominate and control women, then I have to sincerely wonder where the hell you are living. I also have to tell you to stop getting your ideas about gender roles from porn, because porn is in no way whatsoever reflective of actual reality when it comes to how people relate to each other sexually and romantically.

 And stop looking to your teenage buddies to tell you how a man is ""supposed"" to be. You know what defines a man, as opposed to a little boy? Making his own decisions about what kind of person he wants to be, and actively working to become that person and live that life. It's completely possible for a man to prefer the submissive role sexually and still be a respect-worthy adult. Stop asking permission from porn and from the kids at the high school you attend(ed) to be the man you want to be and start making your own decisions about it."

robinhoode,Bitcoin,1389382056.0,"&gt; Without pools, the network would have become far more centralised, far sooner. There really is no technical solution that can mitigate the current scenario. It is more a game theory/political one now,

No doubt it's mostly game theoretic in nature at the moment. But I still believe a technical solution is possible. We found a way to broadcast knowledge about all Bitcoin transactions without issue, via the blockchain. Something tells me we integrate knowledge about pools into the protocol to help mitigate that risk as well.

&gt; Pools are masses of individual miners that are fully rational, that are more than capable of switching pools. The pool operator is not a dictator, nor can he punish dissent among miners, quite the opposite.

The real issue is not they will be irrational, but they will act rationally but against the future of Bitcoin, possibly with a large enough bribe. The current system make work well for decades, but if Bitcoin becomes a widely used currency, there will be manipulators who want to deliberate affect it's value for their own personal gain.

In my mind, centralization is a hard problem because wealth naturally collects, as many have shown in the Pareto distribution. Even if we could somehow change pools, we may run into other types of centralization. Who knows? But simply labelling it as a ""political issue"" and walking away isn't the solution, for me personally."

In the 2000 Sugar (National Championship Game against Florida State), it was a one point game at the end of the third quarter. The only game where VT was completely over matched was the 2011 Orange, which was a 40-12 pounding by Stanford."

dakboy,cscareerquestions,1389382101.0,"&gt;Do you guys think a $15k+ increase in salary would make dealing with my ex-boss easier?

Three points for you to consider.

* HR departments have learned through years of trial &amp; error that making counter-offers to departing employees is rarely successful. The employee usually ends up leaving within less than a year anyway, because their problems aren't directly related to the paycheck. **It's not and shouldn't be always about the money.**

* Someone once told me ""people don't quit their job, they quit their manager.""

* I personally have a graph in my head of salary vs. my ability to put up with BS. It's asymptotic - there eventually comes a level of BS where no salary is high enough for me to deal with it. There are some things in life that you can't put a dollar figure on.

Only you can say whether you could deal with a person like you describe. Me? I wouldn't go anywhere near the guy. If he's paying well above market rate, it's because it's the only way he can get people to work for him."

I'm more open spiritually now than when I was an angry, atheist teenager, I follow Druidism as a philosophy and I do believe there is a higher power out there but I see it more as a force of nature than a big man sitting in the sky judging every move we make. It's just a force, there's no way to appeal to it, and it doesn't make things happen with the intent of causing good or evil. So there's no point in worshiping or praying to it. If it makes you feel better, then right on, but it doesn't actually do you any good.

For some reason people seem to think that that makes me unhappy or something, actually I'm very happy and I have a great life. I just don't need the security blanket that I feel most people use religion as to make it through hard times or bad days. I don't mean to insult people at all, but you don't have to have religion to be happy. I think that's an opinion way too many people have."

I stated that the author of the article made a shitty argument, you made a pretty shitty argument, and regardless of the quality of my overall argument the metrics used by the author of the original article are extremely flawed because it is a fact that regular season performance is not an indicator of post season performance.

Even if I could convince myself to ""believe"" in a god that's organizing our lives and the universe, it would give me no pleasure, because I would still have the knowledge that all the scientific evidence we have disproves the grand majority of the religious truths that believers espouse. That knowledge would cause me to be depressed, not happy.
