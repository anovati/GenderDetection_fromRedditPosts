So, when something has ""filthy beats"" they are saying that they think the music is good since a song will also have a beat of some sort and in this case the word 'beat' is being used interchangeably with 'music'.

Now, the first part is actually a two part question.

""Sick"" or ""brutal"" is just like ""filthy"" meaning something is neat, cool, or stylish.

A ""drop"" refers to the point in a song (if it has such a point) where the music drops out and changes to a different beat. Take [this song here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGWnq3lazFQ#t=1m20s), you can get a glimpse of the song then at the 1:27 mark, the music 'drops' out and the beat changes. "

Even if you only go no-gi there's still a lot of caveats.

You can practice Muay Thai through sparring, obviously you can't go 100% all the time but you can sure as heck also do demos/smokers/amateur fights and see where your skills are. There are also inter-gym sparring nights and demos etc. Much of what you learn in Muay Thai carries over to a 'real'/street fight whereas you try pulling guard on some random guy and next thing you know you're getting your face pounded in as you practically knocked yourself out pulling guard and for some reason this asshole is punching you in the face as try to play your De La Riva guard game."

PositedSymbols,askphilosophy,1389670722.0,"&gt; To apply that to your example - it may be true the moral facts reduce to scientific facts (moral wrongness = pain or something like that) without all of our moral language being reducible to scientific language.

To speak of ""moral facts"" would be equivocal unless we were to determine what exactly we mean when we speak of moral truths. However, the ethical system you were alluding to here is a naturalistic, objectivistic framework. That is to say, the contention is that all moral utterances can be equated to propositions, which may either be objectively true or false (independent of any sentiment) and correlative to some branch of science (typically psychology, from my experience). 

And although I am a nihlistic ethical non-cognitivist, for others, this statement may create contradictory answers for someone who though they were a proponent of an internally consistent position: immorality is the infliction of pain. One could view the an arguably more simplistic deviation from the classical Trolley Problem such as to rectify the conflict for a supporter of the aforementioned: if there was an oncoming train, and the only possible way in which you could stop this oncoming train from steam-rolling five 'innocent' individuals was to shove a 'fat' man in front of the train --killing him in order to save the five--, ought you do so? If an objectivistic, naturalistic absolutist were to claim that any infliction of pain is immoral, then the sacrifice of one to save many others must be immoral. Yet, consequently, the same individual may not find such a sacrifice genuinely unethical. "

It's similar to a Reading/LA class where they read the book/articles/assignment the night before, then come to class ready to discuss and apply.  

It is a lot more work for the teachers.  Because it's a new program, the teachers don't have links to lectures they have previously done.  Every single day they have to be recording a new lesson for their class to view the next day.  And when they have 3-4 different preps, that's a lot of videos to record, edit, compress, and upload.  

Eventually the idea is that they would have a library of their lectures to pull from and that they would only need to redo lectures once in a while based on perfectionism, student needs, new information, changing standards, etc.  

Any program needs the kinks worked out of it.  At this point it means that the 3-4 teachers I've spoken to/heard speak about it are really excited about the format...but they're up until 1-2am recording/processing videos."

TofuRobber,ShouldIbuythisgame,1389670932.0,"I have it and played it a bit. Here's my take on it after playing for maybe 5-8 hours. The art is great. The colors are nice and the animations are well done. The music is good but it's not outstanding. It fits the game really well but it's not something that you look back and remember. The gameplay is pretty fun and interesting. The battle system is probably one of the most interesting thing about the game. The leveling up system is also pretty neat. It's simple but allows enough customization that you still get to develop the character's stats the way you want, kinda.

Here are some of my problems with it. The whole game is based on it's own lore like most tales games. The lore is pretty weak in my opinion with things just happening just because and it just made me question the foundation of their world. The voice acting isn't horrible but it isn't great. It's decent and works well enough that you'll get used to them. The characters aren't that interesting. The main guy character is suppose to be really smart and in the medical profession but he just ends up seeming ignorant of the world around him and ends up being the typical hero. The main female character isn't that much better. She takes on the role of the foreigner who doesn't know the customs of the land. She is the one with an actual goal and purpose in the game. She's suppose to be somebody of power but it turns out she's doesn't really know much about anything other than the fact that she has a purpose and you're left wondering what would happen to the world if she was alone.

Granted the game probably gets better as you play further but initial impressions means a lot to me.

This is still a good game. It's good for somebody who wants to play casually. The story isn't all that deep. Something is going on that can and probably will destroy/break the balance of the world and it's up to you to stop it. The characters each have their own problems that they have to deal with and there's a bit of humor with their interactions with each other. If anything, you play this game because it's generally a fun game to play. It's not too complex and is simple enough that you can basically pick it up and play it. The only really difficult thing is the battle system and even then it doesn't get too hard. On it's own, it's a good game, If you were to compare this game to other JRPGs then it doesn't rank that high because there are better games out there. 

This is my impression of it anyways."

First, I'll say that I don't think *you personally* are significantly overrating Rodgers, but that your assumption of what the majority of people think is a bit off.

At least last offseason on /r/nfl, there were very few people even acknowledging the possibility that there might be 2 quarterbacks who were as good as, if not better, than Rodgers. That ""unanimous #1"" is the biggest reason why I personally think Rodgers is overrated. It did die down a bit this year because Peyton Manning broke both the yardage and TD records.

For example, recently a bunch of us bought our own hard hats because we needed hard hats to be allowed on the work site (the software guys weren't warned of that in advance), and the test event was going to be over before we got purchase authorization. $15 hard hats, requiring pages of paperwork.

Mahhrat,AskReddit,1389671363.0,"By ""This"" are you referring to Gen Y, or even younger?

I'm a Gen X-er, and we seem to have fallen in the cracks a little bit as well.

To me, those younger than me are both more worldly and more idealistic.  If they've received a proper education, they're more compassionate, ecologically responsible and more forward-thinking than their parents.

If Baby Boomers have an almost universal fault, it's in two areas, neither of which is particularly their fault:

First is materialism.  Boomers expect that growth in things will always happen.  Gen Y/Z are more realistic about this - they understand concepts like peak oil, and the damage we're doing to the environment.

As a result of that materialism, Boomers are also far more selfish.  They have earned what they have and they are in no hurry to share it, which is why you have increasing numbers of ""grey nomads"".  I think the economy - particularly here in Australia - is in for a massive shock in about 15 years as the Boomers start really dying off.  The real estate industry will be massively over-saturated, and many service industries reliant on the elderly will be under-subscribed.  

Second is experience.  Boomers had parents that accorded respect based on knowledge, wisdom and experience that had remained largely relevant.  Younger generations have no time for that though.  They understand change has outpaced that knowledge in many ways, and any information they need is usually at their fingertips.

To flip the coin, Gen Y are far more sceptical.  They hold very little truck with traditional ""authority"" figures, which can make getting them to pull together on a topic difficult.  Employment is a great example - productivity increases with retention of longer-term staff, but Gen Y's natural cynicism and desire for instant gratification (see below) means they change jobs more.  

As I said, Gen Y are impatient.  If they can't have it now, they lose interest very quickly.  This can be a bonus, but in terms of learning, they can lose out.

I think Gen Y are better though because they're more open-minded.  As an X-er, I remember much stronger undertones of racism and sexism in my life than I see now, and I think that's fantastic.  My daughter, who's nearing 15, sees the various 'isms' and is confused and shocked by it - the idea of judging someone based on something they can't control is abhorrent to her."

No, I'm saying that I did say that.  

""...short women probably have it the worse as far as wage discrimination"".

&gt;It's dismissive and extremely misogynistic.

Why?

Fact one - Household income is calculated by combining the incomes of the working members of a household.  

Fact two - Short women are more likely to be married than short men. 

How can two facts be construed as misogyny?  Do you deny that these two facts are facts?

donaisabelle,MakeupAddiction,1389671517.0,"Lip liner is necessarily *necessary,* but it certainly helps a lot. If you're able and willing to reapply often, and you don't have a lot of problem with your lipsticks wearing off, you don't necessarily need it, or need to wear it every day.

However, I find it very helpful. I use MUFE's Lip Line Perfector (which is clear) for most of my lipsticks. I don't just apply it on the outside line of my lips to prevent feathering - I also fill in my lips to help the color adhere. It probably adds at least a few hours to my wear time, or helps me last through a meal with a much less embarrassing amount of color loss.

I think a clear lip liner is fine for most colors, so if you go the lip liner route, you don't necessarily need to buy a matching lip liner for each of your colors. However, I find that dark colors like my UD Revolution in Venom (a deep plum) are better with a matching liner, as well as bright reds."

Thing is, there was a huge hole behind the sandbags, so you could duck and stuff i guess, but i didnt know, so when i was jumping i prepared for a 2-3 feet fall, when in fact it was 5-7 feet. I fell with just one foot, injured it pretty badly and lay down in the hole, holding back tears, for a couple of minutes.

I, of course, being surrounded by all my friends, came out like nothing had happened, but when the game was done, my foot hurt like hell, i couldn't even walk because of the pain. So i go to the doctor, and he says it's pretty lucky i didn't break the bone, but i have to wear a cast and use crutches for 2-3 weeks.

calrebsofgix,WeAreTheMusicMakers,1389671946.0,"I posted it before but I think it works here too. To wit:

It all starts with an idea. This idea may come at any time. You may be riding a motorcycle through the desert. You may be backpacking in Europe with no one to keep you company but a monkey and an atlas. You may be taking a huge dump. Actually; you're probably taking a huge dump.

Once you have this idea it all boils down to a few basic things:

You know how to play the guitar? Good. Pick a key. Start with the ""one"" of that key (the ""one"" of C is... you guessed it; C). Now move on forward until you find what chord is next. It's probably the ""five"". I'm not going to give you a theory lesson right now. Figure it out. It may be the ""minor six"". Go for it. Just play these chords until you find the right next chord. It may take a while. Don't give up. There's only one right chord. You'll get it.

Now that you have an idea/concept/inspiration and a chord structure just start strumming it in circles. You'll get a rhythm for it after a few play throughs. Now add some words. They don't have to be good. Just sing the first thing that comes to mind that makes sense with the theme that you've chosen. This should be the melody. This isn't necessarily the words you'll end up with.

Once you write a vocal melody you'll probably find that the chords that you wrote are absolute horse-shit. They don't fit with what you wrote. There are better chords out there. Now find the right chords. Again.

Once you've got a rhythm and a melody and a chord structure you're ready to write some real words! Excited? Don't be. It sucks. There's far too much in rhyme theory to go into right now and I'm going to assume that you've listened to some songs and you know basically what's going on. I'm going to suggest you focus on getting yourself out of the ""A B A B A B A B"" scheme (or even the A B A B A B C C scheme) and focus on making good rhymes.

Here's what makes a good rhyme. It's simple and always right. I guarantee that if you find the sweet spot here you'll never go wrong. People love this shit.

Rhyme something with another rhyme that doesn't really rhyme. Here's an example that, shameless plug, I wrote:

&gt;Now through the motorhomes and coffeeshops I'll fly

&gt;Lookin' for your face in every window

&gt;and from the comfort of this

&gt;hotel mattress I

&gt;will watch the news and make plans for tomorrow

See how close/slant and exact rhyme were mixed? This is an excellent technique. It keeps people on their toes. Try, also, to include something visceral. Use imagery, both visual and olfactory, to allow your listener to connect with what you say. Don't be afraid to be too specific. The closer to home, the worse it hurts, the better.
Consider the idea of using internal rhyme to offset end rhyme (but not all the time) like in the following example:

&gt;I'm laughing nervously cuz I can't see

&gt;if my jokes are any use

&gt;when our friends see me now I am

&gt;terrified that they will know the truth

&gt;honestly in the hours

&gt;before you arrive

&gt;you know you make me feel

&gt;like everything well it all might be alright

That example includes both of the above-mentioned rhyme concepts. Get a feel for how long words take to say. Consider where the stress is in each syllable. Maybe read some Shakespeare so that you understand the subtle emotional differences between iambic and trochaic. Listen to the music inherent in the words. If you're really, really writing a song then every part should be able to stand on its own. The words should be a poem without the music. The vocal melody should sound good even if it's being played by a horn section on an easy listening record. The chord structure should move perfectly from one place to the next so effortlessly that the audience never even notices that there's any background music.

Now; take everything I just said...

and completely ignore it. When you write a song it should sound like you. Maybe you're looking for discord? Maybe you want to write licks. Maybe what really calls to you is three chords over and over again until your eyes bleed. At the end of the day, you have to make the listener feel your hand like a father guiding his child gently towards the future. I should never feel like I could've written your songs. Your songs should have external quality, sure, but they should flow from you. And sometimes that means just going with it and seeing how it all falls out.

If you want to write like Connor Oberst, Tim Kasher, Bruce Springsteen, or any number of other great lyricists (all debatable, I'm sure), however, the one thing you definitely have to do is take. your. time. and be sure that you do it right, whatever that means."

So if you want questions for your theory to answer, I would suggest to shy away from using loaded questions. The first question, in particular, is especially infringing because it assumes a factor which is certainly not true.

Here are some questions your theory needs to be able to answer:

1. What is gender?
2. Can gender be chosen or is it predetermined?
3. Why do the genders of men and women exist in different civilizations throughout the world (emphasis on different civilizations)?
4. Can gender be changed?
5. How many genders are there? Why?
6. What power should institutions such as government have over gender?
7. Is one gender favored over the other(s)?"

donaisabelle,MakeupAddiction,1389671964.0,"Not only do I reapply after meals - I completely wipe all my lip color off before meals, if I can do so without looking silly. I find that when I eat, I open my mouth really wide and somehow my lip curls all the way under and gets lipstick on my chin, so it's easier to completely remove and completely reapply when I eat.

As for drinking, I try to drink everything through a straw to avoid messing up my lips. Like, I drink hot coffee through a straw like a tool. As you get more experienced, you'll learn little tricks to maximize your wear!

My strategy for times when I want my lips to look really good as constantly as possible (say, at a classy party), I find it easier to use a low maintenance lip crayon like Clinique's Chubby Stick Intense that I can easily reapply on the fly if any comes off, than my complicated but normally long lasting matte lip looks. If I lose any color off my complicated look, it's so much harder to fix it on the fly.

I've found that /u/intangiblemango's four-hours-and-a-meal standard is a pretty good one to go by as far as makeup longevity. (If you haven't, read [her blog](http://www.brightestbulbinthebox.com/)... it's got a lot of helpful reviews about lip color longevity.)"

Slukaj,truegaming,1389672189.0,"&gt; Go here fight these guys, but you have multiple ways to go about each fight.

And the only variety there was that you had a bunch of different guns/plasmids.

Which Bioshock Infinite had.

|Plasmid|Vigor|
|-------|-----|
|Telekinesis|Return to Sender|
|Incinerate|Devils Kiss|
|Cyclone Trap|Devils Kiss|
|Electro Bolt|Shock Jockey|
|Sonic Boom|Undertow|
|Insect Swarm|Murder of Crows|
|Winter Blast|Bucking Bronco|
|Security Bullseye|Possession|
|Hypnotize Big Daddy|Possession|
|Enrage|Possession|
|???|Charge|
|Target Dummy|???|

Bioshock Infinite boiled some of the plasmids in Bioshock down into a condensed set of roughly the same powers, removing the more useless effects of each plasmid.

Yes, there were quantitatively fewer vigors than plasmids, but it's tough to say you had fewer options. *Aesthetically*, I guess you could say ""Well, I can't freeze guys and whack them with my wrench!"" which is absolutely true, but I'd just respond with ""Well, you *can* throw guys in the air with Bucking Bronco and whack them with your Skyhook"". Same underlying concept: immobilize target, beat them to death. 

|Bioshock|Infinite|
|--------|-------|
|Wrench|Skyhook|
|Pistol|Broadsider|
|Pistol|Hand Cannon|
|Machine Gun|Machine Gun / Repeater (Higher damage, lower ROF)|
|Shotgun|Shotgun / Heater (Incendiary)|
|Grenade Launcher|Volley Gun / Hail Fire (Weaker, less ammo, higher ROF)|
|Crossbow|Carbing / Burstgun (3-round burst)|
|???|Crank Gun|
|Chemical Thrower|???|
|???|RPG|

So we have the same number of guns in each. The only real argument you get is that you can't customize those weapons. Instead, you get variant guns which, while not as preferable, is still definitely a choice.

Environmentally, both made a lot of use of environmental hazards. Explosives, oil, water, etc. But Infinite has two additional mechanics that Bioshock did not: sky rails and Elizabeth's environmental rifts. And lets be real, those are *huge* differences compared to the first one. 

So maybe you lose one or two vigor powers, and maybe you lose some modifications, but what you gain are two really big level enhancements that let you really play with the flow of combat. "

I said that short females are more likely to be married than short males.  That's a statistical fact.  Where did I say that every short female will get married.  I thought we were talking about statistical averages?

&gt;Second saying it doesn't matter that she makes less because she'll get married is extremely dismissive.

When did I say that?"

You can believe whatever you want.  It doesn't matter what kind of opposing, plausible viewpoints are placed in front of you, you always manage to stubbornly cling to your own beliefs.  

You've got moxie, to quote that guy from Rocky.  

If I might ask, how would you define a stupid opinion?  Would it happen to be one that you are vehemently and juxtapositionally opposed to, or simply one with no viable application to the current discussion?  

I'll go out on a limb here:  I'm generally against abortion.  That being said, in the case of rape or incest, I can see how a person would see it as a viable option.  I'll not fault their decision; it is their decision, and the consequences, good and bad, are theirs to be owned and embraced.  

I'm just trying to understand how one can be so intolerant of an opposing viewpoint, to the point that further, possibly enlightening discussion is impossible.  

If you've suffered some kind of severe personal experience with the subject we're discussing, then I can see where you would be so hard against the very idea of circumcision that you simply cannot fathom another viewpoint.  If that's the case, then I'd like to extend my deepest apologies for the inflammatory language I've used in previous posts.  You're entitled to your opinion, and I'm entitled to mine.

&gt;I think the only time blame is worthwhile is when you're trying to make sure it doesn't happen again. But even then, I don't think it's a good idea to frame it as ""blame."" Just a slight alteration in how they approach this part of the conversation would help a lot. Instead of ""who's to blame,"" it should be, ""that sucked. How did we get to that point and how do we make sure it doesn't happen again.""

My response to her was:

&gt;Yes!! Thank you, that's exactly what I'm trying to get at. It's not about the blame at all, but it's okay to point out something that went wrong. Just don't focus on whose fault it was, because that's not the point.

That's probably a far better explanation of what I was trying to say.

But yeah, to me, it's not meant to be a way to avoid responsibility, and good faith is definitely a good way to describe it, and maturity definitely helps.  I want to be with someone that can understand what part of the situation they're responsible for.  For example, let's say my SO caused us to be late for something, let's say trivia with our friends.  Next time, maybe I'll say something like, ""hey, let's try to leave a little earlier today, I don't want to be late for trivia again.""  It addresses the problem, she's smart and mature, she knows that she caused us to be late, and there's no need to point fingers.  If it persists?  Then yeah, I'll be more direct about it, but so long as everyone is on the same page, it should be fine."

Do I have to keep pasting your same quite over and over again? You say short women are more likely to marry sooo... It obviously doesn't matter that they make less since as soon as they marry the big strong man will make up the money difference. You seriously can't see how dismissive and misogynistic that is?

fffangold,atheism,1389672662.0,"There is actually some pretty sneaky word play going on here.  
  
In Catholocism, there is a difference between redemption and salvation.  
  
Jesus's sacrifice is what redeemed all of humanity.   
  
Salvation is bestowed by God. In a basic nutshell, the normal method of salvation is entering the church, accepting the sacraments, avoiding sin, and confessing the sins you do commit to be forgiven and cleansed of those sins. The Catholic Church also teaches that there may be other paths to salvation as no one knows the mind of God, but the Catholic way is the sure way.  
  
Edit: Don't get me wrong, I still think Pope Francis is doing much better than his predecessors, particularly in trying to unite people around common goals and focusing on what brings us together rather than what divides us. But he is sticking to church teaching and hasn't changed it, he's just going with the more positive parts."

testudinidae,HomeImprovement,1389672665.0,"What is plugged in to the outlets on that circuit?  Lots of things?  A few things that draw a lot of power like space heaters, irons, or stereo systems?  Are you using any electrical outlet adapters or power strips to increase the number of things you can plug in to one outlet?  Is there any pattern to when the breaker trips?  Does it happen when you're watching TV, flipping a switch, or something?

It's possible that you have a faulty breaker.  They're really easy to replace, but you have to know what you're doing.  Messing with your panel requires working around your full line amperage, which will definitely kill you if you mess up.

I think it's more likely that your circuit is overloaded and the breaker is doing its job.  Someone along the way may have wired too many things to the circuit, or you may have plugged too many things into your outlets.  It's also possible that there's a wiring fault somewhere that is periodically grounding itself out.

If you don't know what you're doing, you should hire an electrician to have a look at it.  Do not go messing around with your panel if you don't know what you're doing -- even if you turn every breaker off, there are still wires in the panel that are live and will kill you.  Also, don't replace the breaker that's tripping with one rated for a higher amperage or your house may burn down."

ch0colate_malk,starbound,1389672726.0,"So i figured it out... When making a gun, in order for it to work in multiplayer, the projectile type referenced in the .gun file has to be a projectile that exists in vanilla. I doubt other players would be able to see the gun but at least the end result would work. However, most projectile files also reference a config file in the projectiles/explosions folder. So I thought, hey maybe it will work so long as the .config file is from vanilla and I can at least have my own projectile. So what I did was create a weapon with its own projectile that referenced bomblockexplosion.config (the file that zbomb.projectile references) the results were... confusing... So the .config file contains all of the information for the impact of the projectile, the explosion animation, sounds, and the in game effects. So one would think that if it wasnt going to work that none of those things would happen... However what actually happened was the projectile shot, hit the ground, played the animation and sounds from the .config file.... BUT didnt deal any damage... the reason this is strange is because the .config file contains the information for all of those in code... so it executed every part of the code except for the damage part... However in single player it would indeed execute the full code and damage blocks."

thedancingman4321,CarAV,1389672844.0,"Flat is ideal for home theater, where a ""perfect"" curve curve would be flat down to 15hz (subsonic). For car use/music, a great curve for sound quality would be flat down to 25hz, or maybe even a peak at 25hz. That will produce DEEP bass, and I can't think of a single song that has a note lower than 25hz. That being said, staying above the 0db point down to 25hz will make you happy. For curves like that you will make a decently large box (the size you are using is a good size) tuned to 30hz will generally play down to 25hz with a 3-5 db peak at 30hz, producing louder bass in general. It is easier to tune higher than it is higher, but people are generally happier with lower tuned boxes. 

This is where the sub comes into play. In your case, the sub you have is inclined to play higher notes since it has a higher resonant frequency. I would guess 40-50hz.  Most 12"" and larger subs have a resonant frequency around 33hz or so. They play louder are lower notes. 

The box you have will be punchy as hell (low kick drums are around 50hz), but will not really create the sense of deep, infinite bass, which I personally love, as well as a lot of other people. "

Unfortunately I'd be even worse off living with my grandmother because although she's a genuinely good person she suffers from some sort of paranoid personality disorder where she thinks certain people are out to get her, so if I had to be around her for an extended period of time I would probably become homicidal, lol.

I'm definitely curious.  I've never done it (although I did try, didn't work), I heard it feels different, so I want to know what it's like.  Plus, it's not invasive for me because no one is sticking anything into *my* butt, so while I can understand while women could easily be turned off, it's not so much a big deal to me.  I would never in a million years push that on someone else, but I'd definitely ask.  And the ""have you"" question is definitely due to the novelty of it.  Hell, I'm not even remotely turned on by anal, but there's this curiosity that I can't get rid of."

That said, I will offer criticism based on trying to fix the existing problems rather than tell you to scrap it entirely.

The bit about the ""super hot guy"" is bad -- you're making assumptions about the reader that are not very flattering, and you're also insulting yourself by comparing yourself to this made-up dude. The joke about ""orgasm output"" is a big nope for me -- too forward for a profile. The joke about your students finding your profile isn't funny enough for the amount of space it takes up.

I can understand where they're both coming from, but in the end it all seems to come down to the fact that it's easy for any particular person to assume that their own gender's preferences are better because they've only ever been rejected by the opposite gender's preferences, and getting rejected frequently ends in thinking you were ""unfairly"" rejected."

Which leads me to my first question for you: do you or did you deal with these same issues? If so, how did or do you deal with it? Jealousy was mentioned below, which is related, but not the same I find.

Further: 

Are you all in a closed relationship or an open one (ie. can the circle expand easily or are you otherwise traditional despite the polyamory?)?

Any kids?

Would you agree that marriage should be expanded to include polyamorous couples? And if it was done so, would you marry your other boyfriend?

How are the guys? Taking it well? Context: I was in a poly relationship with my at-the-time long-term girlfriend (+ technically her girlfriend also, but we never saw her, though it seems she was jealous of me), and my now-current boyfriend, but my boyfriend actively disliked the relationship between me and said girlfriend. Eventually she broke up with us to further the relationship with the other girl, and it was just me and him. I'm wondering if any kind of drama similar to this has ever occurred, or if my case was not the norm...

Sorry for so many questions, I've never really met anyone else in an active, practical polyamorous relationship before... (I think). Happy for you :)"

Ker_Splish,electricians,1389673310.0,"Aww shoot, my bad, I didn't see the reply man.  

I work in a ""closed shop.""  When you hire on, you immediately start on a probationary period, and start paying money to the union. 

In my case, because I hired on as a laborer, I paid entrance fees and etc.  into the NCFO union.  When management put out that they were looking for people who wanted to switch crafts and become electricians and machinists, I did the little song-and-dance, mostly for show internal application process, general electrical aptitude test, and interview at my shop.  

(I must mention here that this is where my 6.5 years as an avionics mechanic/helicopter electrician stuff from the military applied--the test was fairly basic, stuff like ohm's law, troubleshooting, electrical safety and how to make a 3 phase motor switch directions.)  

When the shop director told me I'd be going over to be an electrician, (he gave me about a week's notice), I basically just started showing up for morning roll call for a different foreman.  After I started paying into the IBEW, an impromptu apprenticeship ensued, until I had completed my probationary period (again!) and was eventually ""set up"" as a journeyman.

kempff,cheatatmathhomework,1389673334.0,"n. The rate of change is negative whenever the graph is going down. So, from -3 to 0 and again from 2 to 5.

o. (What self-respecting math teacher uses a lower-case ""o"" for *anything*?) The rate of change is zero when the graph is level. So, from 5 to 8. BUT WAIT ... it's also level at isolated points such as 0 (not o or O but 0 ... see why we don't use lower-case ""o""?).

* And just for clarification, at -3, 2, and 5 the graph makes an abrupt change of direction in such a way that the tangents to the graph on approach from either side do not close in on one another smoothly, so these three points are disqualified on that technicality. So is 8 because there is no such thing as a tangent approaching from the right.

p. The average rate of change is constant whenever the graph is straight, so from -∞ to -3 and again from 5 to 8.

* More clarification: Yes, the average rate of change is constant for 5 to 8 because the *rate* of change is *constantly 0*. Don't get hung up on the distinction between ""zero"" and ""constant"".

q. The average rate of change is decreasing whenever the graph is concave down, so 2 to 5.

r. The average rate of change is increasing whenever the graph is concave up, so -3 to 2.

* From -∞ to -3 and from 5 to 8 it is not concave in either direction, hence the average rate of change is neither increasing nor decreasing.

cgsur,AskReddit,1389673410.0,She probably has not been without sex for 1.5 years.
Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389673410.0,"My now ex was 11 years older than me. I was 19 he was 30. 

Now, here is the sad bit... his family even admits they were shocked at my level of maturity, and his mother when I finally got to meet her said it was, ""...a little sad I showed more maturity and promise,"" than her son. Many of his friends and family noticed an improvement in his character and thought there was hope for him in the long run, because of me. I at a party even before everyone left overheard his step mother (loudly) whispering to him, ""You have a good thing going for you... DON'T FUCK IT UP!"" 

The man in question was in prison a few times for drug possession (marijuana) and once for stealing a delivery van, but he was overall a very sweet man and I never was honestly never treated poorly. 

Now, in my defense, I was 19 and had an uneventful high school life (being the token gay kid in high school I never got a chance to date like my peers) so when I met him I was desperate for some love and affection. 

Yeah, didn't end up too good; first few months were fine. He had a few weird quirks but I helped iron those out. He started dressing better, grooming himself better, slowed down on the pot (at first), odd shit like that because he'd been a bachelor for so long. It was a nice feeling because I felt like a ""wifey"" and it was a good feeling, something I kind of craved. 

Then it all went to shit and more and more was pretty much expected of me. I got thrown to the way side for pot and booze and soon didn't feel like a lover, but more like a mother and that was not a good feeling - it got to the point the relationship mainly was centered around him. Not to mention I came to the conclusion that he was extremely immature and would sadly never grow out of it, but instead the more he got to know me the more and more immature he became. A weird example was near the end he only really got interested with sex unless it was outdoors, something I never gave in to, and that would upset him. 

I was with him for a year, but was done after 6 months. I was about to break it off, but sadly he lost his job and I spent 6 months more with him helping him find work... THEN I broke it off. 

However, I don't look back on it with much disdain, I actually learned a lot from it. I call it my training wheel relationship.

**Let me emphasize, these kinds of posters are the exception, not the rule.**

However, issues with negative self-image do exist, and those that have issues with it could probably use the help of a professional to help guide them through techniques to have a more positive self-image. While a positive self-image isn't going to abolish heightism or any of its effects, it will change their outlook on themselves, and potentially help them stop lashing out at others."

dakru,AskMen,1389673570.0,"There are two things that are likely at play.

The first is that when you have a girlfriend you seem more comfortable, more relaxed, and perhaps less desperate. All of this makes you more attractive. It's why many of the more effective ways to improve your success with women focus on building a better mindset where you're comfortable, relaxed, and not desperate no-matter whether you're in a relationship or not.

The second is pre-selection. The basic idea is that the fact that one woman wants you can make other women think (not necessarily consciously) ""well there must be something good about him"". For whatever reason this seems to have more of an effect on a man's attractiveness than a woman's attractiveness, although I wouldn't say there's never a similar effect the other way around."

akatokuro,changemyview,1389673639.0,"Let's examine the [aforementioned scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcLAOcutuxs#t=55) of his ""blunder."" 

Fight break out and he heads out. Lands on the skiff and Luke immediately uses his superior weaponry to destroy his blaster. Not phased, he uses momentary distraction to tie Luke up with fibercord, sealing the fight. However, the gunner on the sail barge decides that is a good opportunity to fire, Luke is able to move his lightsaber slightly to deflect the shot, forcing Fett to dodge and release tension on his fibercord, freeing Luke. Luke goes to deal with the newly arrived sandskiff. Boba gets up, and takes aim at Luke with his wristrocket, but gets hit from behind (mistakenly) by Han, causing his jetpack to malfunction and lead to his (movie) demise.

Breaking that down, Boba did well. Despite immediate setback, he takes the advantage, but is foiled by friendly fire. Then again he is ready to take the match point, but is hit from behind and subsequently suffered equipment malfunction. Now, the argument can be made that he should have taken care of Han first, but really who can fault him for being more concerned with the Jedi swinging around a lightsaber than the blind man.

While this is no evidence for a good reputation in itself, it certainly doesn't show incompetence. 

Looking back at what happens at ESB, it really is brilliance. He correctly predicts the Falcon didn't flee the system and is hiding, so he hides as well. As a result, he is able to track the Falcon (who he has been personally told not to destroy, but deliver to Vader), and extrapolate the intended target of Bespin. From there is able to alert Vader and setup an ambush to capture them as cleanly as possible. Remember there are two bounties here: 1 is on Han from Jabba, the other is on the delivery of the Falcon to the Empire, which he does to the letter. 

During their time on Bespin, he is confident enough to convince Vader to give him Han (thus completing the double-bounty), as well as challenge him for compensation should he not survive the freezing process. Just think about that, he stands up to Vader, the most notorious Villian of the Empire. Following this, he holds off Luke from getting to his friends, while also NOT killing or hurting him (remember Vader wants Luke, and doesn't want the Emperor's prize 'damaged'). Then he gets away cleanly with his second bounty of the day."

dakru,AskMen,1389673752.0,"&gt; They say stuff like ""I'm a boob/ass man"" ""I like White/Black/Asian/Latina women"" ""I prefer tall/short women.""

I see men frequently try to downplay their physical preferences in what looks like an attempt to make themselves seem less ""shallow"". Sometimes they completely ignore it and say ""no all I care about is personality"", and sometimes they obscure it (like the ""ambition"" example for women) by saying something like ""I just want her to be healthy"".

&gt; When you hear ""I want a guy with ambition,"" let's please be real and call it what it is, and you want a guy with money.

I'm well aware that money plays more of a role than what people like to admit, but I think it's more than just money. It's also social status and success, things that (even on their own outside of money) frequently do quite well with women.

Take, for example, a man being an athlete on a university sports team that does well, or a man being in a band in the local music scene. Even with no real implication of money in these situations, both of them will probably do better attracting women than the average man due to two things: success and social status."

testudinidae,frugalmalefashion,1389673798.0,"MFA has [a pretty good suit guide on the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1nt5wv/an_extensive_look_at_mens_suiting/).  Here's some info from that guide.

`Purchasing`

`MTM versus OTR - The biggest choice you'll have to make about suit purchasing is whether to buy a made to measure suit (MTM) or a suit off the rack (OTR). With a MTM suit, as the name implies, somebody takes your measurements - or in the case of online retailers, you take your own - and a suit is built specific to those measurements. The trade off of course is this method tends to be more expensive and takes longer to receive your suit. Off the rack on the other hand means buying a suit as it comes from the retailer. With an off the rack suit, you're going to want to get some alterations done so it fits you better. Many department stores will offer this service if you buy your suit from them, but look around and see if you have any local tailors that can do alterations as well.`

`Online Ordering: A Caution - Generally, your first suit – or first couple – shouldn't be bought online. There's a couple reasons for this, and the first reason is also the simplest. The best way to see how a suit is going to fit you is trying one on in the store – there's a lot that goes into suit fitting, and if you're new to suiting, you won't necessarily catch all the little details. Additionally, there will be some kind of salesperson there to help you. Now, this can be a little more hit and miss – some salespeople will have no idea what they are really doing. On the other hand, some have been working with clothes for much of their lives, and could point out things you miss. If the place you're ordering from has a great return policy, you can afford to take more of a chance in this department. Just something to keep in mind for anyone new to suiting.`

`Bespoke - Bespoke refers to a garment made entirely to the customer's specifications - a paper pattern is created just for them, which the tailor then uses to make all their suits. Here you can see a room full of patterns, each for a specific customer[1]  . Some of the advantages of bespoke include being able to tweak your pattern as you gain or lose weight as well as getting every single detail you want. This of course, comes at a price - bespoke is the most expensive suiting option available.`

`Cheap Suits - The biggest disadvantage of a cheap suit is durability. They also typically need a lot of alterations to look good because they're build to fit the highest number of men. That being said, there's a time and a place to buy a cheap suit. For example, if you're a student (like myself) you'll typically only get 5-10 wears of a suit per year. Durability isn't as much of an issue here as price. On the other hand, if you wear suits every day, you'll absolutely want to invest in a quality suit - a cheap suit will start to fall apart relatively quickly with that kind of heavy use. Finally, your options will be more limited with budget suiting. The higher the price point, the more non-standard options for details you'll typically find.`"

ChaoticParadox,AskReddit,1389673850.0,"&gt;&gt;Right, because guys are so accepting of fat girls, older women, girls with bad teeth, girls that don't wear makeup, girls that have the hygiene habits of men. Women shouldn't be put up on a pedestal, or held to higher standards. What would be completely unimportant in men are somehow dealbreaker ""flaws"" in women: if she doesn't rip out all her body hair, she's disgusting and vile, but it's somehow natural in men. If people continue to hold women up to ridiculously high standards, the ones that are deemed acceptable by society will hold their partners to equally high standards.

Did you really just try to pass off all this shit that's easily fixed with discipline as REAL problems? Your argument here is utterly infantile. Grow up, eat healthy, don't whore around when you're young, bath and brush your teeth regularly, shave your damn legs, and get off your high horse cause women put themselves up on pedestals and then expect men to treat them like princesses by default. Not only that, but you still have the nerve to bitch when we give you that much, and you wonder why we all turn into assholes. 

Unbelievable. You are insane. You're insane. You're asinine. You're short-sighted. You lack depth. You're depressingly uninspiring. You contribute nothing yet you expect everything. You're just awful. Euguegu-fuck you.

&gt;&gt;Even so, I don't agree with looking for casual sex in multiple partners. Having a sex friend is great, but asuming that the girl you just met is comfortable and willing to form a momentary sex partnership that precludes all form of relationship (especially if you're complimenting her and feigning interest in her life all night) is absurd and impossible. Unless each PUA was explicit in his interest, I could never support the red pill; it's nothing to do with mens rights or their confidence if the aim is to swindle others into touching your genitals.

Again, you're insane. TRP is not PUA. PUAs come to the red pill and realize they're still dumbass beta pussybeggers. TRP teaches men to be completely honest about reality. I hide literally nothing about my intentions and I don't give one fuck about what you think of me. You don't like what I have to offer? Great. Next! Nobody gets *swindled* into sucking my cock. They do it because they want to, and if they don't, I don't waste my time with them. Plain and simple."

&gt;“The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work,” Newell said. “It’s by giving those people a service that’s better than what they’re receiving from the pirates.”

He's saying that by putting anti-piracy measures in software, it becomes an major inconvenience and makes the pirated software the superior and easier to use version. The pirates are giving a service that's better than the legit product. In the case of software, piracy numbers are never indicative of a stolen product when the product is full of anti-piracy measures because a large number of people buy the software, discover the hassle of the anti-piracy measures, and download the cracked version.

It still relates here, because if I could watch a TV show any time I wanted, be it in my home or at the airport on my laptop, I'd pay for it. However, I cannot do that unless I torrent it, therefore the pirates offer a superior service."

The author of that comic *might* have been dealing with depression, I'm not denying it but for the love of god STOP denying that he's an introvert. 

In my experience I spent most of my time doing solitary activities because social ones were too draining for me. As I grew up I felt my social skills didn't grow much. So I can still relate to that comic, okay maybe not to that extent but I can still relate to it. Maybe your social skills might be well developed but mine aren't. Just because you can't relate to it doesn't mean that it's not about Introversion. I feel it's disrespectful to look at a comic and say - ""oh depression!.. this one frustration.. this one bad social skills.. aha! shyness! - that's not introversion"". Your identification of these things might be correct but IMO they're all still related to Introversion. 

It is not okay to keep pointing it out. If you feel differently about this then please let me know your opinions about this. I would like to understand this better from your POV too.

Another suggestion is Vanity jeans, as they have sizes up to 37"" inseam. Normally they're boot cut and mid rise, so it's worth a shot. As a bonus, they also used to be mid rise, though I don't remember anymore.

The other other suggestion would be to try a pair of mid rise men's skinny jeans. They often, on the right woman, look like a pair of boyfriend cut jeans. They may be an excellent option for you.

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389674139.0,"&gt; A women shouldn't have to get married to have a better income. 

My comments were not proscriptive.  They were not even normative.  We were talking about statistical averages through facts.  Nowhere did I say or imply that because this is how things are, then this is how they SHOULD BE.  I made no claim that anyone ought to do anything.  

My only claims were that (1) shorter women (as a group) face more wage discrimination in the workforce than short men (as a group), and (2) short women (as a group) have a higher household income than short men (as a group).  None of these things invalidate individual outcomes.  We are talking about statistical averages here.  

How is any of that dismissive to anyone?  How can simple facts be dismissive?  I'm not telling women to get married.  I'm not telling men to have leg-lengthening surgery.  I am stating statistical facts.  "

synthasaurus,AskReddit,1389674185.0,"PhD student here. Write with a plan. Before that, though, start by recognizing how much energy is wasted agonizing over a paper that needs to be written. Students get term assignments and do absolutely nothing for 90% of the term. You just let it hang over your head and spoil your mood. Instead, put a little bit into your plan. Write your topic sentence. Think about your sections. Draft an outline. It is better than weeks of, ""I have to write this paper, should get started, I'd rather be doing something else, life sucks"", or take 20 minutes to crack a book and at get some ideas floating around.

If you know what you want to write, write a more formal outline. Go get the books you'll need. Spend another 20 minutes flipping through them. Make some notes. Again, let those ideas float around for a few days. Keep your notes close, and when you have a good idea, write it down.

Once your outline is fleshed-out, write a section. Don't start with the first section. Do something in the body. Something you could write without research anyway. It doesn't have to be perfect, just get something down. That's enough for the day. You can edit later.

Tomorrow, come back and spend 10 minutes fixing it up. Much easier to start with garbage than with a blank page, isn't it? Now, write another section. You've already got your out-line, so there shouldn't be much thought involved. You're just turning point-form into paragraphs if you did your outline right.

Repeat for as long as it takes: review what you did yesterday, and write a few new pages. If you start to loose focus, revisit your outline and flesh it out a little more. Call it a day. Eventually, you'll have a paper. Keep on editing.

What I am saying is that ""getting in the zone"" starts days earlier. Writing is a creative process. You can agonize about deadlines and your under-preparedness, or you can take 20 minutes to get started, write some ideas, and put your mind at peace. Once your ideas are written, you can copy and paste to organize them. Once you have made a start, outlining (and full-on writing) is just a matter of filling-in-the-gaps."

For example, being a female in male-dominated spaces on the internet nets you some really weird reactions that won't happen in real life male-dominated spaces, and some really weird reactions that do. For example, if you were to play MMOs and out yourself as a female, you're likely to get the following reactions:

* free stuff because vaginas
* people accusing you of ruining the game
* people ragequitting because vaginas
* people whiteknight-ing because of the previous two
* people trying to find out incredibly personal information about you
* people treating you like you don't know anything about the game

In contrast to real life male-dominated spaces where you are likely to get:

* people treating you like you don't know anything about what you are doing
* people trying to get in your pants
* people ignoring you/minimizing interaction
* people mentally requiring more of you before you are seen as equal

There are only a few things that cross over into real life, and it is unfair to paint short guys that you might run into in real life as some kind of bitter rage-fueled misogynists because there are a vocal handful that are in a smaller corner of the internet."

We completely open up to each other, have long philosophical conversations, talk about what we want out of life, and shared our deepest secrets. I don't really open up to people about my life, so this was a big deal. I'm completely falling for this girl but she wasn't single, and I was moving across the country. We had been skyping a lot, I see her over the holidays, she talks about how she wants to come see me over one holiday, and how she wants me to come to a wedding as her date. Still not single. I head home over the summer, she is single. We go for drinks, hitting it off like usual, go back to my place. We scheduled stuff to do for the rest of the week, and things were going really well. A few more drinks, go hot tubbing, she's just wearing one of my tank tops, hardly covering anything. We go in and shower off, lots of laughter and flirting, just having a genuinely good time. Get in bed, hands start touching on the outside of clothes, I tell her how bad I want to kiss her, she says no... Aaand I didn't kiss her. Thought process went ""You know what, things went so well tonight, and we've got a full week to spend time together. Don't want to be too aggressive now since we're pretty drunk, but I'm going to tell her how I really feel tomorrow."" She seemed fine in the morning, but dodged me all week. We've hardly spoken a word since.

Python is a good one to start with.

And then you'd probably write something like... a program that implements an instance of escrow, or something... And writes an exchange function that says that if the consideration on one side is equal to a certain specific value, and the consideration on the other side is equal to a different specific value, the deal is approved. And comment all over that to signify to courts that it is intended to represent a contract, and... you're good. I think.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389674583.0,"&gt; What do you mean ""break through apathy""?? The goal is for you to find a way to break through to apathy.

I'm not so sure about that.

I come to TRP and PUA and game from a fairly different starting point than most guys. I actually started out with a lot of natural aloof jerk game and getting a decent amount of attention from women. I was worried that there was something wrong with me because I couldn't bridge that into a meaningful relationship.

Thanks to TRP, I at least had people who were willing to say that the way I am isn't so wrong. As an added bonus, it also made it vastly easier to understand my parents' relationship, my sister's slutty behavior, and my sister-in-law's insane attachment to my jerk boy brother who somehow always seems to be down on his luck.

I will tell you that with all that information, it never got easier for me to cope with the idea that there's no real benefit to be gained from women besides sex. Yes, it cleared up the point, but it hardly extinguishes the existential crisis that ensues from knowing that you will never ever truly possess a meaningfully invested partner.

The latest post on Rational male does a pretty good job of summarizing how a lot of us feel on the other side of TRP. http://therationalmale.com/2014/01/08/possession/

GeoffreyArnold,short,1389674879.0,"&gt; I think he may have meant that being short doesn't have to be treated as the worst thing ever?

He's had seven hours to explain what he meant, but he hasn't replied.  But, I'm willing to explore that possibility, if you wish to act as his proxy.  first of all, I don't think most of the posters here think that being short is the ""worst thing ever"".  In fact, I happen to believe that being short isn't a bad thing at all, and that only heightism is the problem.  But, putting that aside, I don't think that people here think being short is the worst thing ever.  But, because this is a forum about being short, it can seem that way.  If this was a form about hamburgers, you might be saying that some posters treat Mayo like it's the worst thing ever.  

&gt;And, while short people (men especially) are regarded as socially inferior in pretty much every dimension, there are a few posters in here that seem, to me, to have such a negative image of themselves that they have latched onto the easiest scapegoat - their short stature - and use it to lash out at anyone that suggests the slightest bit of anything positive about being short.

I can only think of about two posters who do that.  But, your point is taken.  However, we must also acknowledge that much of what's posted as ""positive"" are really just assertions of facts which are false, or some form of embracing the idea that you're inferior due to your shortness but that's ""not a big deal"".  

&gt;Let me emphasize, these kinds of posters are the exception, not the rule.

We agree on that.

&gt;However, issues with negative self-image do exist, and those that have issues with it could probably use the help of a professional to help guide them through techniques to have a more positive self-image.

That's true.  I don't think that should be the purpose of this forum, but that's just my opinion.  But, something like that might be very helpful to some people in their personal lives.  But then again, many people who come here to vent, may be very calm and collected when their away from keyboard.   

&gt;While a positive self-image isn't going to abolish heightism or any of its effects, it will change their outlook on themselves, and potentially help them stop lashing out at others.

Very true.  Even though, I don't mind the ""lashing out at others"" so much...so long as they're being honest and logically consistent.  I happen to think that ""positivity"" for ""positivity sake"" is a bad way to social justice.  But, you're right that self-esteem is important for a healthy life.  "

There's no reason for it to be more expensive than our current welfare system, though it could be argued that we don't spend enough on welfare as it is.  You'd also be eliminating government bureaucracy, which would cut down on waste.

The reason I am against money being required to be spent on something specific is that I just have a problem with welfare treating poor people like they're children.  ""You MUST spend the money we're giving you on food, healthcare"", and some people think we ought to even drug test them before letting them qualify.   If you give poor direct cash, they could even invest some of it and yield returns that could help them get out of poverty much more quickly.  I believe that poor people know how to spend their money more efficiently than the government knows how, and I think that also would be better for the economy."

This isn't atypical either, with, for example, clearance Nikes on their website being 5 times more expensive than in the stores. Lucky Brand Jeans, too, go for $20-$30 in the store clearance, and $70 on their website. (Which, by the way, probably won't work for you, but you might as well.

However, I think the better idea for ADCs is to create a non-crit build. I think BC/LW/BotRK/Runaan's/Frozen Mallet might make a really cool type of ADC build: Zero crit, but zero crit wasted on a non-IE build, or on effects like BotRK that don't crit.

If you buff FM for range, buff RH, and make one or two more on hit items for ADCs (maybe an Executioner's upgrade could be among them), you could theoretically make a legit onhit or arpen/onhit build for ADCs that focuses on RH instead of IE. It would be sacrificing a bit of damage for a bit of survivability, but it would be really cool.

I think mobility might be the one stat keeping that build from viability. The FH gives some kiting power, but... if you add a pd/ss challenging mobility effect to RH (straight MS if nothing else), that might put it all over the edge."

reyrey1492,AskMen,1389675211.0,"Okay, this is from a few years ago. A time when I was young and stupid. Quite socially awkward and very not good with women at all. Here goes:

It was '08 or '09, I had just finished a rehearsal for the ren fest. Group of friends, the entertainment director, and I went to a Bob Evan's. Old people food, but it's one of the ED's favorite places. Our waitress was pretty cute and the ED loves to play matchmaker sometimes.

All through the meal he's dropping hints (not too subtly) that I'm single. Really building me up like none other. The whole table of 10 other people joining in. Seriously everyone at the table is painting a veritable Mona Lisa with how awesome I could be for this girl.

Problem is I have no idea what to do with this precious gift. It's too much pressure for me. An hour and a half of building me up more and more it's time for the checks. All I would have had to do is say, ""So what's your number?"" Instead, very stupid, awkward me exclaims (I seriously yelled this at 10 pm in a Bob Evan's) ""Pretty women scare me!""

The waitress goes red, drops her head and shuffles off. I hang my head in shame. The rest of the table is busting a nut. Nobody says a word for an agonizing 5 minutes because they're too busy laughing their asses off.

I still have not been able to live that one down. I doubt I ever will."

I am naturally that guy . . . the big problem that arises from being that guy is coming out of it enough to really game a girl. Particularly it can be difficult to match energy levels with women who want you to come and play.

This weekend I went out and this pair of girls walked right up to me. The one girl is like three inches from my face just bopping up and down, trying to get me to engage with her. The first words out of her mouth were ""Why do you look so sad?"" And she's basically bopping up and down like a Jack Russell Terrier hopped up on ecstacy trying to get me to be more energetic.

I hate those moments. You cannot win in those moments. If you go out and start bopping around at her pace, she'll quickly lose interest in you because you ceased to be the distant guy that she found to be hot. But if you don't engage her, she'll eventually get dispirited and give up. I've never really found the right way to make that transition.

Actually, scratch that, the few times I was ever able to make it work I usually just grabbed the girl and started grinding and making out with her."

2) He sounds like he is just using you.  I see lots of behaviors in your post that that scream this in all-caps - continuing to do things that you don't like regardless of your protests, noticing that he's causing you to bump your head and ignoring it, etc.  This is not normal, and it is well within your rights to stop sex that you do not want/enjoy.  If he complains, too bad.  Sex is not an obligation, and you do not owe him a single thing.

3) Yes.  If he gives you excuses or whines, give him an ultimatum: shape up or ship out.  Be firm, and don't let him get you to cave or think little of yourself.

Are you aware that Asperger's Syndrome is considered an outdated diagnosis? Since early 2013, when the DSM-V was released, it has been simply reclassified as one of the upper-ends of autism spectrum disorders. Likewise, you may have been diagnosed with Gender Identity Disorder - this is gone too, it's now ""Gender Dysphoria"".

Have you had therapy or whatever for the Aspergers/autism? If so, if you don't mind me asking... how did that go, and what did it consist of?

Would you consider yourself Intersexed?

Do you identify as any other LGBT+ category?

Would you consider the transgenderism or the Aspergers/autism the worst to deal with?

Would you consider yourself lucky in the transgenderism colluding with the Klinefelter Syndrome? Or is this a case of a double-edged sword? For example, I myself am an MtF transsexual (likely not Klinefelter, though I've not been tested), and I would've given so damn much to have a body that wasn't so masculinized or absent of feminization (puberty effectively drove me to attempting suicide) and on top of that to start hormones at the very young age of 16.

kempff,askscience,1389675603.0,"Yes. Since the flashlight gives off a cone of light, the diameter of the illuminated circle will be a simple multiple of the distance away.

Let's say your flashlight is like mine and makes a rather wide cone so that at an arbitrarily standard distance of twelve inches from the wall it illuminates a circle measuring twenty-six inches across. I know from simple geometry - viz., similarity of triangles - that at 24 inches the circle will be 52 inches across, at 36"" a circle 104"" across, and so on.

This is more than enough to derive an equation; at a distance of x inches, the circle will be (26/12)x inches across. So shining it on the barn twenty feet away makes a circle just over 43 feet across, since the ratio holds as long as the units are consistent.

Over to you: If I am holding my flashlight level at a comfortable height of 43"" above the ground, where will the cone of light first strike the ground in front of me, and why do I favor this flashlight for walking around in my back yard?"

It's not as though without drugs, police officers would be out of jobs. The DEA would have tough luck, but your nearest police station would manage just fine. Police officers and police departments don't make their bank off of petty marijuana tickets and bong confiscations. They don't even go hunting for those guys -- it's a waste of resources and time. You're talking nonsense.

If you know of any hardcore drug dealers who are pushing coke by the kilo, go tell the cops about it. They'd honestly love to hear it. Call in the FBI if you want. They pick the low hanging fruit because that's all they can reach, not because they have a ""do not reach high fruit"" policy going on. 

I also don't know why you'd think catching big dealers would stop crime at its source. Catching one guy who sells drugs is good for the rest of the drug dealers. It creates demand. Prices raise.

Armagetiton,videos,1389675831.0,"&gt;The anti-piracy measures are in software because it gets pirated. You're paying for a specific product in a certain form, that's it.

And I argue that a large portion of torrent traffic are legit customers that are pirating the software because the anti-piracy measures are a hassle. Software DRM is not a solution to piracy, it's a cause. Another cause is regional releases; one region receives the software before another, so people in the region waiting for the release torrent it. 

&gt;If people could watch any TV Shows and movies anytime they felt like it in the comfort of their own home, people would still pirate/torrent because it's free.

That brings us to the rest of torrent traffic: people that never intended to pay anything in the first place, meaning it was never a lost sale. You're absolutely right, some people would still download it because it's free. However, products being available on services such as netflix reduces piracy [by as much as 50%](http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/09/17/netflix-ceo-says-torrent-piracy-in-canada-down-50-per-cent/). 

The goal of offering a better or at least equivalent service to the pirates is not to eliminate piracy altogether, that's simply not possible. The goal is to mitigate the damage and keep those willing to pay for convenience around. "

lamblikeawolf,short,1389676080.0,"&gt;If this was a form about hamburgers, you might be saying that some posters treat Mayo like it's the worst thing ever. 

True.

&gt;However, we must also acknowledge that much of what's posted as ""positive"" are really just assertions of facts which are false, or some form of embracing the idea that you're inferior due to your shortness but that's ""not a big deal"". 

I agree that the ""positive assertions"" about 'confidence' or 'you just have to talk to women' etc. are less than factual. However, there is a fine line to be walked between being comfortable with yourself and being ""inferior but it's not a big deal."" And I am not sure how anyone would clearly be able to demonstrate the difference in a few exchanges of words on the internet.

&gt;But then again, many people who come here to vent, may be very calm and collected when their away from keyboard. 

This is something I almost always forget to consider.

&gt;I don't mind the ""lashing out at others"" so much...so long as they're being honest and logically consistent.

Well, again, I think there is a difference between ""lashing out at others"" and ""ranting negatively"". It doesn't serve any person to be mad at person X just because they belong to the broader category R and category R as a whole statistically trends negatively in their treatment of short people.

Everything I didn't specifically respond to, just assume I agree with, otherwise this post of mine is going to turn into a mess."

MadreVolpe,relationships,1389676176.0,"Listen, you fell in love, and hard, but not with a person. You fell in love with what could be; ultimately most of your time with this person was through the lens of a screen. Sure, you might have had a great time in Texas, but so many relationships are easy for the first couple months. Real love, long last, I'm-going-to-propose-to-you-in-South-Africa love, is built on a foundation of trust, acceptance, and care. You were hurting and in pain, and honestly if he really was your perfect guy he wouldn't have resented you for it. Love is when a person is there for you even when you have stinky farts your period cramps or are having a bad couple of days.

My advice; take time to mourn what could have been, but remember that it was only one path of many, and feel lucky that he showed his feelings as soon as he did. The harder you cling the more it will hurt. Next, fall in love again. Dream about a proposal (maybe this time at the North Pole! Who knows?!) there are plenty of excellent men out there, and plenty of paths. Keep on dreamin' sista, cause one day it might come true :D"

Do this looking at a side view in the mirror, you'll probably notice your elbow move up a little bit with the weight. This reduces the energy spent by your bicep and consequently your gains.

Now go do bicep curls on an include bench. You'll find your elbow/arm doesn't move nearly at much, if at all. You'll also find that you will not be able to curl as much sitting at an incline because of this.

Give yourself a certain amount of 'cheat'. Work out what you really, really enjoy. I love tea and something sweet, so that's what I kept. I cut out/substituted the less important things.

Learn how to make healthy, filling and yummy food. Pot set yoghurt, honey nut muesli and fresh fruit is a breakfast that can get you well into the afternoon. Have wraps instead of sandwiches. Look for things like vegetable or high fibre pasta. Make salads something to look forward to with things like roast pumpkin and fetta. Make a trail mix with the things you usually pick out of the pre-made ones - mine is almonds, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, cashews, macadamias, turkish apricots, dried mango, etc. It should be something you *want* to eat; keep a small container in your handbag so you can graze and don't go looking for something nibbly that you might feel guilty about later.

3. It's that easy to bypass MLB's drug testing.

4. It's that easy to bypass MLB's drug testing only from 24/7 monitoring of a PED expert.

5. Is ""Bobby"" the person MLB hired to break into Porter Fischer's automobile to retrieve the second batch of documents?

6. MLB hired ex-Secret Service and FBI agents?

7. MLB offered A-rod a 50 game suspension, that he refused. The 162 game suspension? Three repeat offenses (50 games each) strung together for 150 games, and +12 games.

I do think looks absolutely have a hand in shaping who we become because of how differently society treats attractive/unattractive people. So, in that sense, our appearance does become part of us. But I also think it's how people handle that judgement that's more telling of who they are as a person than their actually appearance. 

Ultimately, people want what they want in a partner and trying to apply logic and reason and 'fairness' to those preferences isn't going to make any difference. Wealth and status can be fleeting and so can looks, but character and personality are what I try to judge a person on and what ideally, I would like others to judge me on. But, you know, that's not real life.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1389676648.0,"Everyone is initially attracted by looks.  To me, this isn't superficial so long as it goes deeper than that.  You need a partner that you're attracted to, right?  So looks are important, and aren't they the first thing you really notice about *anyone* that you don't meet online?  What basically happens is you see someone that you find attractive, or at least attractive enough, I suppose, and then you see if there's more to them.  If they're cool, then you try to date them.  Attractiveness is important to just about everyone.

But things like money?  Eh, that's a bit more superficial to me.  It means they're likely pretty materialistic, or maybe they don't want to work hard themselves.  They figure that if they marry rich, they don't need a well paying job, so maybe they're sort of lazy about their careers, I dunno.  Plus, someone can not have a lot of money now, but will later down the line.

However, having said that, I can absolutely see how money would be a +1 initially to what you think about someone.  So long as it's not the only factor, such in my looks example, it's not a big deal.

Because the camera is recording every other line. If you record in 'p' it's going to be progressive. That basically means the camera is going to record every picture as a whole at whatever resolution you say.

So! You can record st 1080i and save space but it comes put 'liney' OR record at 1080p and it not be liney but lit look better (but take up more memory on your camera).

reyrey1492,AskMen,1389676828.0,"Here's what did it for me: I looked in the mirror. I really looked at myself. I'm flabby, round, soft, just overall kind of gross. My face is fine-ish, but my body, the other 99% of me is not attractive. On top of that I was hospitalized a year ago for blood clots in my lungs. I'm 23, that's way too young for that shit.

I don't go to the gym for health, though. I go because I want to be good looking when I take clothes off. I want to be objectified for once in my life. I want the majority of straight females to find me attractive because that's what I want in my life. I want an attractive girlfriend so I gotta be attractive too.

I don't ask people out because I'm not confident. There are better, more appealing options to choose from so I feel like an afterthought. I'm the guy who's fun to be around, who can tell jokes, be entertaining, caring, etc. Some would say 'nice guy', but fuck that noise, I'm not a doormat.

Look in the mirror. As long as you're alright with how you look the motivation (in my experience) won't be there. When you're suddenly actually done with seeing yourself look the way you do is when you'll make the change. Hate your present self so you can make a better future self. 

Don't plan, just do it. Get the gym membership you've been putting off and then just go. Everyday. Keep going until your present you is your past you. Set attainable, realistic goals and keep them. "

jaynay1,nba,1389676848.0,"I mean the Saints won the Super Bowl with a defense that did nothing but force turnovers.

Wait wrong sport.

So at least for this season, there is virtually no correlation between TO% forced and defensive rating(R^2 for a linear fit was like .02, and nothing else was much closer).

However, R^2 for a linear fit between TO% and win% was even worse(And again, only used data from this season), at like .003.

Even throwing out the massive outlier that are the Trailblazers, you still only get up to R^2 = .05, which isn't great.

So while these models aren't all that useful because they're so scattered, there is still an (albeit extremely weak) negative correlation with defensive rating but positive correlation with win%.

Here's why:  Excluding the massive outlier that the Blazers still are, the strongest correlation produced was with Offensive Rating.  R^2 = .103, and the line of best fit was y = 1.0602x + 90.146

So basically speaking, teams that focus heavily on forcing turnovers actually somewhat hurt their defense(Weak negative correlation to defensive rating), but they help their offense a lot(Strongish correlation to offensive rating), and as a result, help their odds of winning a bit maybe(Weak positive correlation to Win%)."

TimDaEnchanter,leagueoflegends,1389676923.0,"I find that it is fairly easy to dodge from max range once you have boots, although maybe that's just me.  Then again, when I play against Mundo players, they usually try to hit me with a Q from max range, and maybe 10% of the time they were too far away so it never makes it to me, and then I can dodge a significant amount.

If they aim the Q so that it will hit a minion if you dodge, then they will only lose half the health cost since the other half will get refunded, but this limits the area they can aim the cleaver by a significant amount, and will push the lane, making it easier for the jungler to come gank him.

Either way, with his main damage skill having a health cost, he will usually lose fights/trades early, and won't really be able to ignore the costs until he gets his ult or Giant's Belt (at which point he usually begins to get extremely hard to kill).  However, pre-6 before he can back to get the giant's belt or whatever he might get, he can be bullied a bit, and if your jungler sets up a tent at top, you can hopefully get enough kills on Mundo that he won't become a giant problem.

Maybe it's just that in my elo, people don't know how to play Mundo, but I never seem to have too much trouble with it.  For what it's worth, I'm in Bronze I, but almost always have gold/plat players in my ranked games."

Wyboth,AskReddit,1389676991.0,"&gt;Words aren't physical violence. Go fish.

Yet, they can hurt a person all the same. Do you understand what a metaphor is? Because that's what I was making.

&gt;That's not my concern. Something will always offend someone. If you are easily offended, don't listen. You aren't required to be here.

You've already made this argument. I've already responded to it. I'm not going to repeat myself.

&gt;I'll say what I want, when I want. And you can't stop me. :)

You can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make him drink. I get it. I'm saying you *should* stop making sexist jokes, not that you *must* stop making them. There is a difference. The former is a suggestion, and the latter is an imperative. I've been suggesting this whole time. Of course, the decision of whether to stop or not is yours. I am simply trying to persuade you to stop.

&gt;I don't have to do what you tell me. It really is pretty arrogant telling someone else how they should live.

This is the same argument as your last paragraph.

&gt;There most certainly is. They don't need to be on reddit if they don't like the discussion. And neither do you honestly.

Not like they have to deal with it every day in real life or anything. What are you going to tell them then? ""Oh, you don't *have* to live on this planet if you don't like the discussion?"" Case and point: women cannot escape sexist jokes, so people should stop saying them out of respect for women.

&gt;Rofl. I feel great for saying it. Knowing you're offended it by it makes it that much more satisfying to me.

I see. You feed on pain. You enjoy watching people suffer. Don't deny it; you just said it. ""Knowing you're offended it by it makes it that much more satisfying to me."" That's the same as saying ""Knowing that something I said has caused you to suffer brings me great pleasure."" You aren't just apathetic towards the rest of humanity, you hate it with a passion. But why? Why would you *hate* humanity, when we have made so many accomplishments, and when you yourself are a member of it? Perhaps it is not humanity you loathe, but yourself, and you project that hatred onto others. I think this is the case. I doubt this will get through to you, but there's always a chance you'll actually listen and seriously evaluate your beliefs. If there's a chance, I'm going to take it. I have nothing to lose, and you have everything to gain.

&gt;I laugh at them. Not killing someone isn't a form of respect. Rofl. Are you fucking serious?

Killing was too extreme to get through, I guess. Substitute ""kill"" with ""punch"" now. You respect someone who insulted you enough not to punch them in the face. How about that?

&gt;Do you seriously think you're going to bring about world peace by telling everyone on the planet they can't use certain words?

We're going to bring about world peace by making everyone respect and cooperate with each other. Stopping people from saying certain things that offend other people is a small step.

&gt;And I'm arguing you can suck my dick. I don't have to do what you tell me to. If you don't approve of what I say, tough. Go somewhere else.

Addressed above.

&gt;You don't know me. :)

On reddit, where everyone is anonymous and people can say whatever they wish without being punished for it, our true personalities shine. Because of that, I think I've learned more about your character through this online discussion than I might have if we had talked in person. I've learned that you:

* will act without thinking of the consequences.

* only care about your own emotions.

* feel no obligation to respect other people.

* cannot empathize with other people.

Sure, I don't know everything about you, but I know that you have these personality traits.

&gt;And if your life is so good a simple joke can ruin your day, you deserve to be mocked. Talk about first world problems. ""wahhh someone said something I didn't like on an internet forum!""

It would be different if it was a one-time incident. But this happens to millions of women every day. Once they keep hearing misogyny over and over for that long, they can't help but be offended. You haven't lived it, so don't pretend that you understand it.

&gt;“It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what."" - Stephen Fry

Reply: Why do you see Karate as a waste of time?  It's no different than any other martial art.  It has it's background and history rooted in self-defense and has been split down many paths and has been changed over the years.

Why don't you think it will help in a fight?  Knowing how to defend a punch, and return one yourself isn't useful?  Knowing where to strike in order to stop someone coming at you?  I love BJJ and I love Karate, but if I get into a fight, I'm not going to the ground with a stranger by choice.  The idea of him pulling a knife from his back pocket and digging it between my ribs isn't really a turn on.  I want to keep my distance.

Also, if you look hard enough, and put some effort into it, you can and will find a legit dojo with people that are kind, understanding, and willing to help out no matter what.  The school I was going to hired my GF on to work the front desk because she was looking for a change in jobs.  After a while, she decided she needed better hours(that was the only reason) and she decided to leave.  No animosity, no anger, no bad blood.  They even allowed us to train for a few months free of charge because the owner knew we were in a tight squeeze for money.

So to say just stick with BJJ, and not learn to to hit back if need be is arrogant, dangerous, and just plain ignorant."

mirelliott,AskWomen,1389677190.0,"It's not your responsibility.... but the only justification I could see behind withholding tips, was to ensure that the server is aware in the future. 

By deliberately withholding money which is normally only withheld when a server has done something wrong/poorly, you are then taking on the responsibility to justify your reason, if that reason is not explicit (hint: its not). 

So, apparently it is not your intention to let your servers know WHY you have refused to tip (in your words, 'educating').  In which case I find your attitude disgusting.  You are doing nothing to benefit equality or feminism, merely acting like a self-righteous turd. While the issue of bill placement is a moderately valid one, chances are that your servers will not understand THAT was the reason for not receiving a tip.  Which saves you a few dollars, and ruins someone elses day.  Nice job.


Also, I notice that in your entire response, you addressed me directly as if I am your waitress (YOU are making a huge assumption).  I am Australian, we don't have the tipping culture, and I haven't worked in hospitality for many years now.  So none of this applies to me personally, but I have spent enough time in USA to understand how important tipping is. Which is why I cannot understand your attitude, at all.  "

kyrostolar,DebateAnAtheist,1389677545.0,"I think this question overall is an argument of semantics. As an atheist I hate the concept of God, and the concept of religion. I'm an anti-theist, I do profess some level of contempt for organized religion and the Gods that are part of that package.

The problem is that people don't hate Cuba, they hate communism. I would say I hate God under the right context, but I don't hate God - I don't accept the premise in the first place - I hate the collective idea and belief that has been named God and religion. An atheist showing contempt for God is little more than summarizing a contempt for the alleged authority in question that inspired hatred and oppression and ignorance in so many instances that made so many atheists reject religion in the first place.

If everyone in your church scapegoats their loathing of your homosexuality onto the name God, you learn to aim your hatred onto the scapegoat rather than the bigots that call his name. "

She's found what works for her: she enjoys travelling, she doesn't want to be tied to one relationship, etc. I'm happy for her that she's discovered that about herself and that she's living her life how she wants to. However, just because that's what works for her doesn't mean her lifestyle, wants, and needs are what's best for everyone else. Get a tattoo? Explore a new religion? Make out with a stranger? Fine for some people, not for others. 

That's not to say that everyone who gets married at such a young age is doing so for a good reason or that it will work out; but there are still quite a few people for whom marriage is just a continuation of a partnership that enriches their lives. For the author, marriage represents stagnation: settling down with a white-picket fence and the end of her adventures. For others, at the risk of sounding trite, it's the beginning of their adventure. The important thing is that you understand yourself and what you want to do with your life. "

auto_poena,MensRights,1389677681.0,"OP I think it's a quirk of the legal system. Aside from the possibility that the rapists were charged as kids and the hacker could have been charged as an adult, it's more related to the classification of crime. Unauthorized access to a computer system can be a felony or a higher class felony than rape, regardless of the motive of the hacker.

There isn't (and I think this is a crucial assumption of your friend) one judge somewhere going ""I'm specifically gonna charge the hacker more than the rapists because I live in a rape culture and don't view rape as a big deal"". For example people can be charged with things like misdemeanor breaking and entering and fathers can be charged with felonies for not paying child support. There isn't a law saying stealing isn't as pad as paying child support, but laws and sentencing guidelines can be vague and then you have stuff like this happen.

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389677690.0,"I agree that this menu looks a little...stark.  

Honestly I eat like this sometimes when I am a bit lazy, but ""vegan"" might be a bit more satisfying if you had actual meals.  Also avocados are *extremely low* in protein.  Only about 4%.  Get some corn tortillas, black beans with taco mix, salsa, romaine, and throw the avo on that.

Also, that breakfast seems a bit labor-intensive.  If you have a lot of time in the am, great, but sometimes it is good to have a quick go-to breakfast.

What do you like?  Tacos?  Enchiladas?  Lasagna?  Stir fry?  Burgers?  Sandwiches?  Chili?  Risotto?  Falafel?  

Almost anything you eat now can translate into a easy vegan meal.  

I would *definitely* look through some vegan recipe blogs for inspiration.  One of my favorites is http://blog.fatfreevegan.com/  (she is not actually fat-free) but look around these posts for other great blogs!

I hope this doesn't sound so negative!  I just want to make sure you meet your goals!   I also think that it is also easy to choose one meal across the week (breakfast? dinner? and make it vegan like 6 out of 7 days)  If you want any suggestions, what are you eating currently?

Kaisharga,NoStupidQuestions,1389677791.0,"Living is its own purpose.

Or, to be more blunt about it, life has no grand purpose. Life merely exists, and you have it. 

There's a couple things you can do about this. You can decide you don't want it and end yourself--but beware, once you quit, you can't ever get it back. 

Or, you can take advantage of this opportunity to do things and learn stuff and experience experiences. 

Or you can dedicate yourself towards someone else's purpose, and help with what you may consider a worthwhile and/or necessary agenda--some people do this freely, and some people do this in exchange for Stuff, and that's something you have to work out with the person or people who want to use some of your (limited and irretrievable) time.

Will you reproduce? Who cares? Do you? If so, then make arrangements for it to happen! If you feel like you must be remembered, you must leave your mark on the world, this is the most reliable and tested way to do it. But in the end, the legos go back in the box and nobody will remember you well enough to ask what kind of person you were or what stuff you did. 

That sounds depressing, but I submit that it is true freedom: If no one can judge you, then you are free to do as you wish, and take care of the things that matter to you without any sense of obligation to some ephemeral ""legacy.""

So live. Or don't. Just have all the fun you want before you cash in your chips, because the casino doors lock behind you."

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389678065.0,"First off, understand that the truly natural social gamers (he's one) use everyone around them as props.

If you have a pretty girl near you in your social circle, it attracts other women who start to wonder what the deal is.

The same thing works when you have a successful male friend. If women see you orbiting a successful alpha male, they assume that alpha male endorses you for some useful reason.

I happen to tolerate the guy because, to be honest, I can blow him out of any set I want and swoop any women he attracts, so I don't really mind him acting as a hanger on. I'm not even the only guy in our social circle who uses him this way. I have a young friend who did the hardcore weightgainer thing to put on muscle, and he uses him to draw women in because he's still rather social phobic.

Honestly, even though the social monkey is vulturing scraps, it tends to work out pretty well for him. The biggest issue I've noticed is that he has real issues landing the Big Fish when he catches one. When he gets that girl who's a solid 8, he falls completely the fuck apart in large part because deep down he has a serious beta provider need and low self-esteem (it's nightmarishly bad to watch). He can't meaningfully close anything above a six.

But in truth, the kid's never really been financially stable, he could use to lose a few pounds, and he's kind of a douche. Pulling 6s is basically a win, even if he's just too beta to land the 8s he occassionally attracts.

Of course, our weightgainer friend beats him up for not committing to a lifting routine (the social kid could be massive if he even put in three days a week of real lifting). I beat him up for not pulling his shit together financially. And when he has a girl hotter than a 6 hit on him, all he can do is sit there hemming and hawing about how he shouldn't fuck around on his LTR girlfriend who is a high 4 and keeps his ass afloat financially. (Somehow this isn't an issue when it's a 5 or a 6 . . . real inner game problems there.)

So . . . is he running the kind of game that he needs to be running and could be running?

Hell no.

Is he doing better than he should be given his current state?

Yeah."

Please tell me he didn't really word it this way. Please? Could it be that he sees your niece as a random, broken child that will be in your home and wants no part of that?

Honestly, I understand where both of you are coming from. You want to help her, she's family, you love her. I also agree with him *only* in that it could be challenging and difficult to handle for you guys just as you are starting your own life together.

How much longer until your niece finishes school? A year, two? 


&gt;  She's currently basically a drop out, due to what I see as parental failure (**my sister didn't make her get up in time to catch the bus,)**

I'm sorry, no. At 17 years old you should have figured out how alarms work and know to set them if someone isn't waking you up when your education is depending on it.

Are you sure your niece actually wants to finish school, or does she think maybe by moving in with you she'd be able to slack off and do nothing?

Maybe a good compromise would be telling her that her priorities are finding a job (part time) and finishing school *if* she was to come live with you.

However I still think maybe a simpler solution to this would be teaching the girl how to use an alarm clock and just get out of bed on her own. 

And also, don't do it because you feel as if you owe her mother. Do it because YOU want to help her daughter."

SophieCalle,asktransgender,1389678783.0,"Bucky is correct.  You'd just take the X sperm and apply the genetic code to the X egg.

However, that's where it gets tricky.  You see, for the new egg, they can remove the nucleus, but the mitochondrial DNA would remain the same as the donor's, effectively having three parents.

You could get around this, however, if you have a sister or any female-line women in your family, as the donor, as mitochondrial DNA tends to stay identical for centuries.

So, in theory, you, with the help of a family member, could have, effectively, your own eggs.  And, with that, you and your husband could have them fertilized in-vitro, transferred to your new womb, and you could (at this point it's a huge unknown) carry a child to term.

But, the bottom line is that down to the fertilized egg, it is going to be possible sooner or later.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389679087.0,"&gt; Most women can't tell the difference between assholes and winners

One can argue there is no difference, and that's a big part of why money doesn't matter.

True sociopathic money and nothing else gold diggers just aren't all that common. I think the gold digger claim tends to be something that's tossed out there by guys who are jealous of financially successful dudes.

I can remember a conversation I had with my brother a couple years back. FTR, my brother is the classic financially unstable jerk who women want to fuck anyhow. Now my brother has always been butthurt by my money. In fact, he's butthurt by every successful guy.

We were talking about this guy he was subconstracting some home construction work for who was fat and ugly and flush with cash from years of working as the CEO of a defense contracting firm. The guy's wife was taller, hotter, etc, etc, etc.

Of course my brother remarked about gold digging. Again, I just don't buy the argument that gold diggers are all that common when compared to women who sexually objectify success.

So, I poked around finding out about the wife. Wanna hear the kicker? The wife is also a fucking CEO of a smaller defense contracting firm and she made her bank by herself before she even met the guy.

Here's the thing you gotta understand. Women objectify success. They see that success as relative to their own. And that means that a successful woman is going to objectify a man who is even more successful than she is. 

The woman wasn't a gold digger. She was stuck in a small pool of potential mates and settle for the short fat ugly guy because he happened to be the only available male who was more financially successful than her. (FTR, the defense industry tends to encourage old school traditional no-divorce lifestyles among their executives as a means of insulating themselves against espionage, so her options for peeling off another woman's husband should be considered lower than average.)

Success objectification is a Red Queen Problem that forces women who seek it into a very small mating pool, and that small mating pool is very difficult to understand without some TRP knowledge to bring it into focus."

Give BF4 time, they are passionately doing everything they can to fix it so that we can get a wonderful experience, and the fact that they actually stopped development for other games, just to fix this for us, is amazing and a total game changer. 

As for being arcade-like, it kind of is, as it's slightly simplified, but then again, if you want the real experience, surround-sound, big screen and Hardcore mode is where you want to be :)

EDIT: I thought I shouldn't leave out the fact that I still love bf3 and still play it now and again for the rush and tdm, because they don't seem to have the tdm dynamic down right in BF4 yet, I tend to enjoy tight spaces and magnum-raping. And ofc, the maplist is still incomplete for BF4, so there's that. "

Tall_LA_Bull,sex,1389679351.0,"I had sex with a girl from Saudi Arabia pretty recently. She's in grad school here in America, but has lived in Saudi most of her life until she went to college. Gorgeous girl, and very sexual, but also very naive.

First weird thing was, she could only have sex with me if she got intoxicated first. I was uncomfortable with that a little, until I realized she hardly had to be intoxicated at all. Sober, she was too pent up to so much as let me kiss her. Then she took one small hit of pot, and suddenly she was completely horned up and super duper ready for it. It was like ""misbehaving"" in the small way of smoking pot suddenly made her not responsible for her behavior anymore. Kind of makes sense, considering her upbringing.

Then, once we got into it, she was very, very worried about what was ""normal"". Like I wanted her to play with my balls for me while I jerked off a little, and she thought that was the weirdest, most unacceptable thing, even though she'd happily play with them if she were the one jerking me off. Same thing for fucking her tits. Wasn't ""normal"". There was a couple other things like that, until finally I stopped and basically said ""I don't care what's 'normal'. I'm not asking you to do anything that's hurting you. Either quit worrying and do what I want, or I'm going to leave.""

And OH MY GOD did she love it when I got dominant like that. She immediately said I could do anything I wanted, and proceeded to love every second of it. It just allowed her to relax and not be responsible for what was happening. I slept over, and the next morning she said it was the best she'd ever had. Great sex for me, too, but I've never met someone so pent up about it at first."

This is where your argument become subjective, not objective.  Regardless of your opinion of the two parties (though based on your comments here I think it obvious with which one you side), both were equally accountable for any ""shutdown"" (and I object to the use of this term in a case where the vast majority of federal functions were still ongoing and the majority of federal employees were still going to work).  Knowing with certainty that pushing policies to which republicans would object would lead to that impasse, democrats were no better than their counterparts for pushing those policies regardless of the (slim) majority they held.

Furthermore, there would be no need for these continuing resolutions, which presents the opportunity for these shenanigans, if not for the fact that the Senate hasn't passed an actual budget during the majority of Senator Reid's tenure as Senate Majority Leader.

If anything, refusing to make any concessions regarding the ACA and its implementation has only left the democrat incumbents vulnerable to election losses as the program becomes more-and-more unpopular.  When the shutdown fiasco has faded from recent memory, everyone is still going to remember that the republicans want to do away with the ACA, which at this point only seems to be the advantage of republicans and disadvantage of democrats.

*Edit --* From the interview:

&gt;##Mulan Is Now Transgender As Classic Fairy Tales Get Re-Imagined In New Book

&gt;^^THE ^^QUEERTY ^^INTERVIEW

&gt;**Three of the characters in the book are gay: Rapunzel, King Arthur and Mulan.**

&gt;     Yeah. Mulan is actually transgender. She transitions to male by the end of the book.

&gt;**Where was the inspiration for having those characters be LGBT?**

&gt;     The first one I wrote was Rapunzel. Her story was initially that she just she cuts her hair off.
    And then I was thinking of what might happen to her. And it just made sense that probably she
    would end up getting hit on by girls. And in my imagination she’d be like: “Okay, why not?”

&gt;**She’s been stuck in a tower all her life. She wants to experiment.**

&gt;     [Laughs.] Yeah. Why not? Live it up! You don’t know until you try it.

&gt;     I do think those three characters appear in my head as gay or LGBT because that’s a large number
    of the relationships I know in my life. It just made sense.

&gt;**I agree. Especially with regards to Mulan. As I was reading the book, something clicked and I thought: “Of course Mulan is transgender. It’s all there in her original story.”**

&gt;     Right. I’m so glad to hear that because that’s exactly how it felt. That’s how it made sense to me.

HumanSockPuppet,40krpg,1389679547.0,"Of course. In fact, I think RT is better with smaller groups.

Only War, Black Crusade, and Deathwatch are more combat focused, so odds are the PCs will typically be together and fighting for the same goal at any given time. And any social situations which do crop up typically have the players in the same place, since they're all roughly of the same social class.

Rogue Trader, on the other hand, has greater potential for social elements than the other games. What's more, because the characters can come from such disparate social backgrounds (death worlders, hive scummers, imperial worlds, and all the way up to nobility), the characters may not even be socializing in the same places. That means more division, more separate interactions, and more segmented game-events for the GM to manage and run.

A GM could overcome this by shifting focus to exploration, dungeon-diving, and horrible monsters. But RT feels like it should be as much about politicking as exploration. You're trying to build a trade dynasty, after all, and trade involves people.

I'm running a seven-player Rogue Trader game right now, and lemme tell you...it's *hard* designing scenarios where everyone can be involved and having fun."

There's federal and non federal countries in the world with such subdivisional Houses, and it doesn't mean they're not just mono or bicamenral.                   

As for France, there indeed was a Upper house under the Restauration, yet this house and the current Sénat are separated by several constitution and upper house differents in power, member composition and elections, and even names. UK on the other hand has it's House of Lord running non stop since centuries, under the monarchy.
                   
Plus, the Chamber of Peers wasn't the first Upper House of France. the three previous constitution, under the republic and the Empire  - and in between -, had such Houses.                

There's no ground to call the Sénat a remnant of the monarchy.               

Also, the legitimacy of a House isn't put in question by its member being indirectly elected. The US senate was elected this way, and even nowadays their president is, although in a quasi direct way.        Several countries, even in Europe, have indirectly elected members, sometimes even by the president, or educational institution. Cf for example the Irish Senate or the German president..                    

As for France, the logic of the Houses is to have the lower one representing the people, and the upper one the territories. France is historically quite divided between the urban parts, more on the left, and the rural ones, on the right. On the past, these were heavy divides between republicans and monarchists. That's why in 1958 it was decided to balance it with two houses, even though France isn't a federal country.             

Also, because of the first years of the republic, when France was plagged by the Terror, there alway remained among French constitutionnalists the idea that the House making the important decision must have its power balanced by a second one, differently elected, as to refrain it from extremists changes. France history has been plagged with sudden political fever, as can be seen by its numerous constitutions, and it's seen as a good thing that a second house can be here to ""calmer les ardeurs"" (calm the ardors). Eh, one of the first name of France's upper house was even ""le Sénat Conservateur"" (the conservative senate).

Therefore caring more about looks than personality is shallow even by your very own definition. This isn't about attraction, I wasn't talking about that, I was saying caring about looks MORE than personality is shallow. My main point is that from his comment it sounded like all Tim1101 cares about is looks. It sounded to me like if an unattractive girl were to like him he would push her away just because of her ugliness. He would not like that person solely because of how they look. I'm not saying anyone here is shallow or that looks don't matter I'm just saying that his comment came off as shallow to me and I could see why Lizz_zero might see it as shallow.

Mac OS, on the other hand, is not designed to pursue the same approach as Linux, instead attempting to couple pragmatic efficiency with ease of use and design. 


The same goes for the iPad. Most people, and this isn't a bad thing, don't really need to customize their tech, they just want to record the concert, or take pictures on the beach. The iPad is for them. Which is why the ad works. It's perfectly in line with their philosophy.

i can definitely agree with you on that one. but really, theres no reason someone who WANTS to be fit (not necessarily skinny cuz, ya know, body types and shit) can't get fit. theres tons of info on the internet about getting fit, and if someone simply doesnt possess the WILL to do it, then yeah i'm going to not find them attractive.

Still, if you decide to brave the place on Black Friday, they've got the checkout line down to a science. They have a whole row of registers that only get used on BF. When you reach the end of the line, they tell you which register to go to; it's annoying the other 364 days of the year, but on BF it gets shit done. They have some person with a bunch of balloons at the end of the line and announcements are made where the end starts. They intentionally wrap the line around the store.

screech_owl_kachina,collapse,1389680254.0,"&gt;If you don't require people to have a job, they don't require a car.

I don't think that is realistic. 

What is realistic is that we really need to get smarter about this car thing fast. Most people drive in around in cars that can fit 5 people by themselves. This is more chassis weight to drag around for no reason. [Kei cars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car) are really something we should have been doing from the beginning.

In big cities especially, we also have their retarded notion that everyone has to come to work at about the same time. People therefore spend atrocious amounts of time idling and in the very fuel inefficient low gears. If you figure out a way to spread out start times and get people to work from home, along with smaller cars that allow more throughput on roads, you will save millions of barrels of oil.

We'll need every drop of oil. If people realized this shit sooner (or even today) we really could be set for another 100 years more like the cornucopians keep saying."

Especially if you hang out with other vapers :)    it quickly becomes a hobby as much as a habit.  I have said it is the new iPhone, everyone comparing the features of their setup.  Don't let peer pressure talk you out of a simple ego battery though."

ellathelion,AskWomen,1389680426.0,"I'm engaged to the brother of a long lost childhood friend.

We met (technically, again) when someone from our 'local' (as in, city) subreddit decided to make a facebook group, and I'd just gotten out of an abusive relationship and I needed to meet new people so I decided this might be a way to do so.

The reddit group turned out being a really weird - and in the end, toxic - situation, so neither of us have contact with them anymore. Anyway, in the early stages we (with others) did some voice chat over the internet. On this voice chat he got colossally drunk and when I refused to add him as a facebook friend, decided to (using drunk logic) try to convince me. One of his reasons I should add him was that he 'had a pretty vulva'.

Eventually I gave in to the pestering - I had only resisted because it was funny to mess with him - and we started chatting about pretty much everything. Meanwhile, I'd met a kid (first year uni) who was having trouble with his LDR (high school sweetheart). I convinced him to break it off, having been in a similar situation. The kid didn't sleep for three days, so I decided he needed alcohol and cheery company. I knew going alone would be trouble, so I convinced the both of them to have my now SO come as well. 

We worked on a bottle of scotch, and the kid fell asleep at about 8pm while watching Firefly. We stayed up talking and ended up making out on the balcony. We both agreed we had chemistry and started having casual sex.

About a month later, we admitted we had strong feelings - which was unusual for us and casual sex, as we were normally very good at staying detached - and got together.

Another month goes by, and he catches a glimpse of my childhood friend in a photo. 'That looks like my sister, weird.' We still didn't catch on.

A few weeks later, he mentions going to my primary school, and the cogs start turning, finally. My childhood friend had a hyphenated name, my SO doesn't have one.  
'Wait... S, as in M-S?' I asked.  
'Yeah...?'  
'That *was* your sister.'  

When we contacted his family about it, I was happy to hear that I was remembered as 'hilarious'.

I now live with him and my childhood friend, who is in the process of transitioning to male, and everyone is pretty happy.

**TL;DR My fiance actually met me when I was 8, was introduced to me, grunted in response, and disappeared into his room.** "

TroubadourCeol,SubredditDrama,1389680487.0,"Reminds me of a friend I have who insists that he's a  Major in the Army (which, at the age of 25, would make him the youngest ever to be a  Major), got over 2x the record of confirmed kills while deployed in Afghanistan, showed my other friends a *fucking stretch mark* and told them it was where he was hit by shrapnel while deployed, and claims to have beaten the world record for the longest distance confirmed kill.

Allegedly he has brain cancer as well, and it's terminal but the Army won't let him retire even because of that, so he's staying in college despite apparently owning a multinational company making software for oil rigs, based out of a small town in Montana. 

His favorite story to tell is about how he and his platoon(not sure on terminology here, sorry) of a couple hundred took down an Al Qaeda group of &gt;1,000 on their own by bluffing that there were more Army men than Al Qaeda guys.

Needless to say, none of my friend group takes anything he ever says seriously.

That doesn't mean literally everything belongs to literally everybody, though. People being free to take your stuff means they're taking the work, resources, effort/etc required to get it, which means they're stealing your labor, which makes you their slave. But none of us ""made"" the earth, so it's not ours for the claiming.

""Sharing"" the earth, however, can be accomplished ""virtually"" through taxes on land, natural resource harvesting, pollution, and possibly other Pigovian taxes (since ""inflicting"" ourselves on others damages their life-experience of the earth -- more like a fine imposed on encroachment than a tax, per se).

These can be distributed in the form of Basic Needs Vouchers (or even just as money, if people are comfortable with that level of freedom).

Hence the earth is shared, but private property is utterly upheld. Everyone has access to basic needs being met, but nobody is being stolen from.

I'd suggest just starting with Season 1 and powering through it.  It's a short season, and has a mix of really good episodes (Rose, Dalek, Father's Day, everything except Aliens of London and World War 3) and some painfully bad ones.  Then you get to move on to Season 2 and David Tennant."

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1389680886.0,"Those are the least of our problem. Mostly anyway. 

We'll be cutting Sidney Rice and re allocate that money to Tate and Baldwin. Browner is going to be cut unless he re-signs for the veteran minimum. He wouldn't be a starter anymore anyway. 

Clemons is going to be cut. He's not as good as last year although he's still getting consistent pressure, he's hitting home as often. In part that's because he's sharing snaps with Bennett, Avril. On the D Line, most important player is Bennett. I see us re-signing him over Cliff. Cliff is on a two year, Bennett is one year.

We have a lot of money tied up in Zach Miller. Although his contract was front loaded, there's still some millions there we can give to other guys. Paul McQuistan and Breno Giacomini's contracts (in the 1-4 millions) can go bye bye as well. Giac is better than ever before but we can still find cheaper upgrades. Michael Bowie, a  rookie 7th rounder finally just won and kept the starting LG spot over vet McQuistan and 1st rounder, James Carpenter.


Thomas is priority 1 A and Sherman is priority 1 B. 

Thurmond can bounce if need be, Lane has shown enough ability to play in the slot proficiently and I'm not sure if Thurm won his starting spot back last week over him coming off his suspension. 

So, Browner, Clemons, Thurmond, and maybe Cliff two years from now are likely gone.

All that considered, I trust our draft strategy. "

Skinnier boards flip easier but are less stable, wider boards flip slower but are more stable.  It depends on style.

* Police are alerted to the situation - we don't know where they are in the town. They could be on the opposite side. They could be in the middle of speaking to someone at a domestic disturbance. So, it takes time to finish up that - it could be only 30 seconds, but it's not instantaneous. 

* The police may then have to get back to the squad car - again, this could take a couple of minutes if they literally have to run out of the house they are currently in doing whatever they were doing when the call came in, or in a store speaking to the manager about a shop lifter, or getting ducks off the road or whatever. So maybe this takes a minute or two. 

* Start the car, and start heading towards the address (maybe they'll need to work out where it is using the GPS) - this takes maybe a minute. 

* Travel through traffic to get to the location - sure, police have sirens and they can speed, but that doesn't mean that 1.) they are physically able to get through traffic (if traffic is at a stand still, the police can't move either - squad cars aren't magic), or 2.) people don't get out of the way (sucks, but it happens).

Factoring that all in, eight minutes is really not that long. Sure, it doesn't help someone being murdered - but it's just about being realistic and understanding that police can't just materialize at the scene of an incident. "

fran13r,AskReddit,1389681333.0,"When i was 19, i overheard a group talking about a guy they were supposed to kill on the weekend. I knew who the dude was so i attached a lil note to a rock and threw it to his house in the middle of the night because i was freaking out and didn't know what the fuck to do, they could trace a text message or a call but nobody would fucking figure out who threw that stupid letter.

It was his aunt house, she sells madly delicious pastichios so i went to buy one as an excuse to ask about him the following monday, she simply told me that he moved to the states with his uncle to study engineering.

I didn't know the guy too well, i only played soccer a few times with him in the same plaza where i overheard the gang talking about him, i'm sure he somehow messed up and was in a bad drug deal since that's why people usually get killed around here, plus he was a bit of a dick, but everybody deserves a second chance and i don't think i would be able to sleep if i didn't at least try to help.

Ramsey was lucky to be at a team with weaker competition.

The difference between this year's offense and last years was Offensive Line play. Last year Okung played the full season healthy. Max Unger did too. McQuistan looks like a serviceable guard when sandwiched between those two guys. The combo of JR and Moffitt wasn't abysmal and Giaco was just Giaco. 


Also, Sidney Rice was really important in allowing Baldwin and Tate get 1v1s. They can't be double teams with any regularity. 

This year, McQuistan was shoved outside to LG, Carpenter, who sucks, played. JR Sweezy regressed, in part because Unger went out and still played through arm and chest injuries. When Giacomini got hurt, a couple of 7th rounders replaced him. Anyway, our o line was much worse than last year's.

But the weird thing is, after I gave up meat my diet became *so much more varied.*  I have never eaten a more diverse diet in my life.  Most meat-eaters go: chicken, steak, ribs, with the same sides.  First it is so easy to get substitutes for those things which are so much better for your health and the environment, but then you slowly learn about all of these other delicious, exotic foods.  Remember most vegans were hard-core meat eaters before.  I *loved* my steak and cheese!  

I mean, sure animals can die naturally, we just don't let them.  The average chicken is killed at 9 days old.  There is no ""putting them to sleep"" like we do to our pets.  They are usually strung upside down and terrified.  Their last moments are in great fear and pain.  I mean, what is instant?

This is due to the broader context of power imbalance in which these take place. Social justice warriors get all absolutist and fanatical with this, but there is a legitimate takeaway point, which is that in real life, if somebody doesn't like you because you're (white/cis/het/male/whatever), the world and your own resources are likely to be set up for you to manage, deal with, and work around it. But if somebody doesn't like you because you are (disadvantaged minority), the world and your own resources may not be sufficient, particularly if the somebody doing the disliking of you is a (cop/gatekeeper-to-service-you-depend-on/etc), and since you probably have more of these kinds of obstacles lying around, since society is __ist against you.

I'm competitive so if I start playing against others I'll want to be the best. Realized I needed to up my diet game to lose weight faster to get quicker... quicker.

Then got sick of losing a step at the end of games. Smoking gone. I now do cardio for its own sake.

My competitive drive is strong enough that I literally went into training for pickup sports and rec leagues. I want to win. That's worked for me because I picture myself as bigger, faster, and stronger than those around me. That was challenged and I responded.

I am better, faster, stronger. Each day it becomes truer. Those who can best me become fewer. It's egotistical and vain, but so am I. I would never belittle others, but I will most certainly use my weaknesses to my own advantage. I've started to gain weight (originally -30lb), but I realized it's mostly muscle. So I tied my setbacks to my ego and kept chugging along.

I read success posts on here and work harder because if they can do it, I obviously can. Because ego. I read setback posts and work harder because I am obviously beyond such failures. Because ego. It's not about anyone being worse, but me being better.

Also:

&gt; Define Inferno

I could, but I'd have to charge. (I love autocorrect sometimes.)

&gt; There isn't anything inherently bad about fan fiction (or better: Derivative fiction). In fact, it's a really useful starting point for learning how to write stories because you get to focus on the fiction and narrative rather than character development and settings (both really important in their own right but rarely do people learn discrete structures and limits at the same time or even the same class).

I agree with this, and I think it's part of why genre fiction with stock characters is so important: You have, on one hand, the ready-made cast, and, on the other, a ready-made set of locations, plots, and basic story structures."

Underfunding education for the common people is a classic conservative/reactionary technique. The king of all Russian conservatives, Konstantin Pobedonostsev, argued this notion all the time while he was the tsar's chief ideologue.

- Laos = ສປປລາວ/spplav

- Greenland = Kalaallit Nunaat or Grønland ^(that ø is a difficult sound for English speakers)

Anyway, my point is that we do it because it isn't always possible to pronounce the name properly. You may be able to pronounce a few of them, and that's great, but I seriously doubt you can pronounce them all.

And there's the case of Slovakia and Slovenia, where the two *already* sound extremely similar. Let's see what happens in their native languages.

- Slovenia = Slovenija

- Slovakia = Slovensko

plaidhat1,Astronomy,1389682394.0,"Dark Energy isn't a theory.  Much like ""dark matter"", it's a placeholder name for things we see happening but don't yet understand.  We see galaxies flying away from us at an accelerating rate, faster than we can explain with our current knowledge of physics, as though there were some force pushing everything apart.  That doesn't mean we won't figure what's happening, just that we haven't yet.  This is an area of very active research in physics.

Technically, you have a hypothesis rather than a theory.  Theories have been rigorously tested, where hypotheses have not yet.  Tired light was discounted not just because it isn't a complete solution, but because we don't see evidence to support it.  If you have evidence, please present it.  If you have no evidence, then why do you say we should reexamine an already-discounted hypothesis?"

Narudatsu,Maplestory,1389682559.0,"WARNING: INCOMING WALL OF TEXT AND POSSIBLE TL;DR

As the days of pre-bb start to fade away from my memory, I can't recall an extremely fond memory that stands out from the rest; whether it'd the intense adventures with friends into the unknown, or joy filled gatherings in friendly towns. However, I do have one to share that comes from only a few months and has really progressed until today. So I had spent about a month after returning to Maplestory since the days of Pirate. Walking down Henesys, I bump into a Luminous who's having trouble find her way to Kerning City. Yeah. Kerning City. A bit bored and  wanting to help, I led her towards Kerning City and we stroke up a conversation about daily life and I buddied her. As the weeks turned into months, she got up to my level surprisingly fast (I wasn't really motivated to train but rather henny hoe and meet new people) and eventually she and I started PQing. Eventually I realized how much fun it was to talk to someone I honestly didn't know. It was dangerous(lets be real now. Girls on maplestory.), but at the same time exciting. Eventually we exchanged Skype accounts and video chatted. We would always video chat and play Maplestory together, especially over the weekends. After feeling like we were actually good friends, I asked her if she and I could meet in real life. To my surprise she agreed. Over this past summer, we met up in New York City for the first time. She drove up from Georgia all the way to Long Island to meet me. It was an experience I've never had. Meeting someone from the internet in real life? I kinda got the same feeling you get if you see your favorite movie actor or singer live. Regardless, it was honestly the happiest and most moving experience I have had. I think this whole experience really made me reconsider why I truly love online games, not just Maplestory. It's for the companionship and shared interests that make games great among players around the world no matter where you are."

Nausved,introvert,1389682752.0,"Some of these are things he might like doing someday. But for now, it sounds like he's really not up for them. He's very young, but by 2nd grade, he's probably had enough good experiences and bad experiences to have some idea what he likes and doesn't like. These likes and dislikes will, no doubt, undergo many changes as he grows up—but for now, don't push him into things he's not ready for, or he might develop negative associations.

For me, there were a *lot* of things I was not ready for as a child. The things I was pushed into before I was mentally ready for them, like competitive sports, made me *hate* those things. Today, I *still* have hangups about physically exerting in front of other people, and I'm 28 now! I'm really sad about this flaw and deeply regret my negative early childhood experiences.

But there were other things I wasn't pushed into, and I naturally developed a curiosity for many of these as I grew up. For example, my first role in a play was one I took willingly, and I ended up really liking it—to a degree that surprised everyone around me, since I was excessively shy under almost all other circumstances. I'm very glad for this experience, because it has helped me in many walks of life; the tricks I learned for being brave on stage eventually helped in things like interviews and public speeches.

To take a non-introvert example, I also have bad reactions to roller coasters today because my friends used to pressure me into riding them before I was ready; they trigger bad emotions in me. But I liked horror movies and haunted houses as a kid (and still do), because no one ever made me bite off more than I could chew.

If I were in your position, I'd encourage him to try things that he's curious about, or that he's not sure if he wants to try or not—just so long as he knows he can back out gracefully (for example, it's easier to try new foods if no one's forcing you to clean your plate). But try not to push him to do things he *knows* he doesn't want to do."

AFormidableContender,confession,1389682947.0,"&gt;That doesn't make an opinion acceptable. Hitler believed all non-Aryans should be sterilized or killed. Should we accept him just because he had an opinion?

False dichotomy. 

Hitler's ethical code was objectively, and scientifically unsound. Even in his personal writings, he noted that even he did not necessarily believe what he was saying, but he knew it was effective to accomplishing his ultimate goal. 

You are putting forth a position [feminist] that one can easily argue is equally as hateful, entitlement-based, and irrational as TRP.

&gt;You thought some of the things I mentioned, about being shouted at and followed was unimportant. You're entitled to that, and I wasn't really asking you to get enraged about it, because I already know that you think I'm deserving of no respect, just because I'm a woman.

I don't think you're deserving of no respect because you're a woman; I think you're deserving of no respect because you're an *attractive* woman attempting to propose a position on gender dynamics you have no business having an opinion on. 

&gt;Actually, feminism has it's roots in Marxism, a leftist ideology. So, about as far away from fascism as you can get.

No. Fascism, is de facto socialist. Marxism is socialism. Furthermore, regardless of whether or not Feminism is Marxist in nature, it's Fascist in implementation.

&gt;You said in your last post that all society follows 80/20. Which I pointed out is untrue. European royals and nobility married for very different reasons than most people do today. Even royals today have a different dating experience than non-royals.

I suppose you have a point in that I did not specify, however I thought that was obvious as no one in their right mind would suggest the dating experience of medieval royalty is anything even remotely similar to the 2014 middle class...

&gt; I'm not just talking about Iceland. What I'm saying is that your community is far smaller than that of a country. If you read Malcolm Gladwell's book The Tipping Point, he talks in depth about how large our social circles really are, and the Six Degrees of Separation thing.

Your argument is non-sensical. I could research locations with smaller populations while having been founded earlier than the 800AD, but that would take a lot of time, so I'll do this: If you're going to attempt to posit that survival of the fittest is untrue because that would lead to incest, explain to me than how early homonids chose their sexual partners within a community/tribe. 

&gt; Most people date people who live within a 30 minute radius of their home. People who date cross-country or internationally are the exception.

Unless you live in Hollywood, all locations within a single city are 30min away. I can bus from one side of my city to the other in less than 30min.

&gt;Most people will get married at some point in their lives.

No, they don't. The marriage rate in The United States is only 51%, and of that, 40% of that 50 end in divorce.

&gt;Most people will get married at some point in their lives. Even if they had 1000 sexual partners, they are statistically likely to find an SO at some point in their life, especially if they want kids. So maybe, and this is a very doubtful maybe, the 80/20 thing happens for casual sex. But for relationships, it's very close to 50/50.]

Only if you encorporate the ugly or the physically handicapped, whom are only capable of attracting each other because they have no value.

&gt;Is an Alpha just a guy who has a lot of sex?

No. An alpha male is a man with an majority of strong social, sexual, and/or body language, and is given respect, and/or social and sexual leadership as a reward.

&gt;I don't believe in the Alpha/Beta theory. I don't believe there are two exclusive categories, most people fall somewhere in the middle, and some people are neither.

You can't be neither. There are only two physically possible options. Either you operate with a majority of strong social/body/sexual language, or you operate with a majority of weak social/body/sexual language.

&gt;Some things are relative. For example, when I say I want a funny guy, I want a guy who I find funny, someone who makes me laugh. I might think someone is funny, you might disagree.

You're honestly going to tell me you've never accessed anyone as being more of a quality than they are because you were attracted to them...? This is a common experience and people do it all the time.

If you get overwhelmed by how much you've read, and you think you have enough tha tyou should soak it in a while, then soak it in a while. If you get overwhelmed but you haven't read much of anything yet, then read more. Sometimes context helps, and sometimes you just need more stuff to chew on and become familiar with.

I want to hear ""I know we need to work on this."" ""You're worth it to me, I'll make changes"", when she says that I should just leave I feel like she doesn't care about our relationship.

This is the one thing I hate the most about women. They generally use this tactic at an unbelievable rate. And when they do use it, there really isn't a good response to it, which is why they use it. They want to play victim and give you no good answer. 

The reality is, she wants him to leave, but she doesn't want to be the bad person ending the relationship. She wants to crawl back to her family and friends and say how awful he was for leaving because she could never live up to his standards. 

But in regards to the sexting issue:  
&gt; She just claimed that she wanted to feel “normal” and that’s why she did it. I asked why she couldn’t feel normal with me and she had no real answer.

She's saying your no fun and she's trapped in a relationship with a loser she can't even sext. She has to go fuck around with other guys just to feel ""normal"" male attention because his is that beta. "

Why do you guys as a society keep letting these scumbags get away with it? If the courts are corrupt, perhaps it's overdue and time for street justice against these pigs. For the police that aren't part of this, please you need to step the fuck up.

My mother's close friend is bipolar, and in one episode 3 police officers had to restrain in her, during a manic episode. She went for one of the officer's guns, but luckily she was subdued properly. I thought, if that were US cops, she most likely would have been shot dead.

Do you honestly think that impurities are the only concern? Morphine addiction is a thing. There are many drugs which the government spends a lot of money trying to use in a beneficial manner which still end up ruining lives. Where I am, NBOMe being sold as LSD is a huge problem. But through trying to educate people, I've realized something: most people just don't care. Seriously! The amount of people who I've talked to who were aware of the deaths and still chose to sell NBOMe as LSD or take it 'to get high' is unreal. To believe that everyone will use drugs responsibly if given the change requires either a great deal of unfounded faith in human nature or a willful ignorance of history. Let's be honest: has legalizing alcohol stopped alcoholism? No, and I would argue that alcohol is not as alluring or addictive as heroin. We're going about this entirely incorrectly. What we need is an entire change in society that advocates responsibility and caution, and honestly I don't think that's going to change any time soon. It's easy to post on /r/psychonaut and say that most people would use drugs appropriately if given the chance. But that's because most of us here are responsible users.

Having been through a number of them (yay binge drinking), you can discern when you've had too much to drink...but predicting the onset is more difficult.

As far as your first question goes, yeah. You're going to remember not remembering. Blackouts almost always go hand in hand with hangovers so you'll wake up, irritable and nauseous, and that won't be the worst part. You might be missing articles of clothing or possessions. You might wake up alone...or with several people.

It's not as if your entire night is erased. That run you and your best friend made to 7-11 prior to the drinking is probably still tucked away in your head. You might even remember having a conversation with someone as you were in the process of blacking out (though the topic of conversation may not be as clear). Sometimes you'll come to your senses momentarily. Flashes of a dark room with a puke bucket or someone trying to get you to roll on your side. Really brief, hazy stuff; maybe only 5 minutes total of an entire night, maybe less. And 'stuff' is a valid term there because you don't have any context for the things you remember.

And then you'll roll over and realize that you slept with an old friend. Oh boy."

EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389684494.0,"Your findings are very interesting. However, your claim has been about the statistics not expressly agreeing with Campbell's findings, which does not make her findings untrue. It appears to me that she was able to analyze the findings in the BJS report and uncover data that the report did not think to mention.

I see why you would be frustrated with the nature of this citation, but I press you to actually demonstrate that it is incorrect more than just claim it is wrong because it's ambiguous.

&gt;It can't be cited as supporting the argument by itself, it doesn't even contain a breakdown of mortality (cause of death) to even make such a comparison possible.

You do realize, however, that in context it could be taken that the statistic is referring to leading cause of homicides? Full quote:

&gt;Women are **killed** by intimate partners—husbands, lovers, ex-husbands, or ex-lovers—more often than by any other category of **killer**. It is the leading cause of *death* for African-American women aged 15 to 45 and the seventh leading cause of **premature death** for U.S. women overall. Intimate partner **homicides** make up 40 to 50 percent of all **murders** of women in the United States, according to city- or State-specific data-bases (as opposed to the Federal Supplementary Homicide Reports).

This is clearly stated poorly, but would you disagree with the statistic if it was saying that it was the *leading cause of homicide for African American women* in this time frame? Just curious.

&gt;I don't think that the Washington Post exaggerates the discrepancy, there is absolutely no evidence supporting the statistic in the BJS report at all.

That's not what I meant. The Washington Post is exaggerating the intentions of Campbell's statistic and the importance of her involvement in generating the statistic. However, you and the Washington Post as well as others seem quite fixated on this one statistic... and you're also attempting to somehow blanket it as a feminist conspiracy... that's a bit much.

&gt;Jacquelyn Campbell is [a feminist].

Didn't deny that she is -- she clearly identifies as such, but people who write papers don't have control over people who use their statistics and take it out of context and it doesn't mean that those people use the statistics for the same reason she might have developed them.

And one person making one statistical inconsistency which is taken out of context... well, that's still not evidence of a massive conspiracy by feminists to misrepresent facts. It could have much more easily been incompetency. That could also explain why she doesn't want to answer it -- she knows she fudged the data and shedding light on that would only embarrass her. Hard to blame her for not wanting to answer questions on it. It's not like everything else she has written has been equally terrible, either, and she'd probably rather forget it than admit she messed up. Oh the humanity... 

I mean, if she was really trying to forge statistics here for personal gain and the domination of feminist politics, don't you think she'd be out their mouthing off about how it's true just like some of our favorite political pundits do? At least their strategy is truly effective at spreading false information.

&gt;If Eric Holder to giving a speech bringing attention to an issue in a field where you are working as both a researcher and an activist, using a statistic that is entirely unsupported by the evidence cited, isn't an example of ""the ends justify the means"", then I just don't know what is.

Feminists aren't rushing to defend his claim. There is no real ""justifying of the means"" going on here. Eric Holder used a statistic in a shitty way. If anything, it's evidence of a politician using a statistic out of context in an ""ends justifying the means"" sort of way. I wouldn't be surprised that there is an epidemic of politicians *doing just that* (hint hint, there is).

And that's one example, anyway. One, tiny little example. Would you like to deconstruct the entirety of that report and all its sources, as well as tackle other feminist academics, or perhaps are you willing to concede that there isn't such an epidemic of feminists saying that ""the ends justify the means""?"

My second foster mother hated me because I cried to go home (to my biological parents) all the time; she tried to make me shut up by taping my mouth shut and putting me in the closet, but eventually she gave up foster care altogether. My third foster mother kept me the longest, up until the court let me go back to my real family; she was a very experienced foster parent who'd been doing it for a long time, and she seemed to handle it by ignoring us most of the time, and then occasionally beating us or denying us meals if we got too rowdy.

Why do you say can't? Looks to me like you're confusing ""can't"" with ""don't care to"".

This whole mindset of avoiding pain reminds me of the quote:

**""We avoid risks in life so we can make it safely to death.""**

Guess it all comes down to that idea that if you're unwilling to reconsider your mindset regarding work, effort, risks and ""chores"", you're going to be saddled with the burden of never truly enjoying anything, because you're always going to be worried about the next time you have to experience some outlay of effort to continue enjoying something; if you're continually worried about potential future disappointment, that makes it difficult to embrace your current experience, and can be an indication of anxiety.

This is going to sound shitty bro, but ultimately, it's up to you to decide if something is worth putting in the effort for. Embrace the suck, reap the benefits. Or don't. It's totally up to you.

Maybe consider seeing someone about this difficulty you're experiencing, because it almost sounds like you could be dealing with a mental imbalance (depression/anxiety or the like). Then again, I'm no expert."

superjerry,nonmonogamy,1389684977.0,"Before I get into anything, it is important to realize that if it doesn't feel right for you, then it probably isn't right for you. You need to respect your boundaries and ensure your own happiness (you deserve it, anyway!), or else you will always be fighting an uphill battle.

Listen to the way you talk about this:

* I don't feel good enough.
* I feel sad he never had eyes for just me.
* I dread it and feel sick from the time I learn about his date to the time it's over.

Regardless of your boyfriend's positive intentions, these are your responses to the events happening in front of you. You deserve happiness, and how you see your boyfriend's actions is not giving you any. You must realize that unless your attitudes change or your boyfriend's actions change, this will continue to hurt you.

That being said, there are a few things that you mentioned in your post that need to be pointed out:

* I think that if I were good enough, he wouldn't want this.
* He's so willing to give me away. I must not be special.

These are not necessarily true. He wants this no matter how ""good"" you are, because you being ""good enough"" does not determine whether or not he sleeps with other women. Polyamory is about being complements with other people, not substituting other people. Apples might be your favorite fruit, but that doesn't mean you don't want to eat a banana every now and then -- and it's not like the banana is a replacement for the apple.

Likewise, he's not giving you away because he doesn't think you are special (unless that's what he actually told you). What are your reasons to ""give him away"" to these other women? Because he's not special? Of course not. You allow it to happen because you know that's what he wants; it has nothing to do with how special you think he is, and if anything it seems more like you are willing to give him away because you think he's special enough to get what he wants.

But most people don't think of it as apples and bananas. Most people want their romantic love to be exclusive. If nonexclusivity is hurting you, I think the only thing left to do is to be completely honest with yourself and with your boyfriend. Whatever you two decide on changing, it will probably be for your long-term benefit."

WolfPacLeader,DotA2,1389685281.0,"Alright, you seem to really believe in what you are saying, so I'm going to give an educated, thought out response as to why I believe you are wrong.

You've emphasized SK's strengths, I'm going to go over his weaknesses and why he is, and has been for a very long time, ignored by the competitive scene.

First of all, you are vastly overrating his stun.  If you are talking about single target stuns which cannot be AoE and aren't skillshots, there are only 4 single target stuns in the game, and the best, by far is DK's when cast from his ultimate.

Let's analyze his stun a bit more, more specifically, lets talk about the projectile speed and his cast animation, neither of which are instant.  In addition, the stun can be disjointed, which combined with the subpar animation, allows Anti-Mage, Potm, QoP, SD, OD, Jugg, Naix, Slark, Naga Siren, and Puck to dodge it as early as level 1 with relative ease.  By the time midgame has come around, anyone with a blink dagger or euls scepter can easily dodge his stun.

Ok, let's talk about crit skills.  There are 6 heroes who get passive criticals that are percentage based:  PA, SK, BM, Jugg, Lycan, and CK.

PA has the same chance to crit with a much higher payoff.  

CK has a 10% to crit at only a slightly higher damage, so when we compare the skills side by side with no other considerations, SK's is slightly better.

Bm gets a 25% chance to crit for 200% damage, which I would call pretty even with 15 for 2.75, except Brew also gets evasion.

Juggernaut gets a 35%! chance to crit for 200% damage, which means he will crit more than twice as often as SK, while still dealing about 70% of the damage.

Lycan gets a 30% chance to crit for 170% damage when he is in his ultimate form, so SK's crit is certainly better.

So of the 6, and Lycan being included isn't really necessary, SK has the 4th best crit.

Sure, his ultimate is nice, but if your team is losing a fight, respawning and fighting 1v3-5 isn't going to do anything, and if you are winning the fight, he doesn't need his ultimate.

As far as being a high priority target, SK is very easy to kite, doesn't do any AoE damage, and while he hurts when he can hit a target, that won't be that often without the help of teammates when playing against competent players.  


There is a reason people ignore him, and its because there is always someone who can do what he does better. 

Want a tanky carry with a good single target stun?  Pick DK, and he'll give you incredible pushing, the ability to lane mid, the ability to become a ranged hero, and splash damage.


Want a partner for Wisp?  SK doesn't offer the ability to trigger Tether's slow like CK or the incredible lategame potential of Tiny.

Want someone to burst down a single target very quickly?  PA does more damage.  Naix does more damage if the target is tanky and is harder to kite.  

The thing is SK isn't the best at anything, and is really quite subpar at most things.

The one place I would like him is in a dual core lineup with OD, to give the OD lifesteal, but I haven't seen anyone run that yet.

PathologicalWorker,science,1389685547.0,"There is a section of the Bering Sea that is international waters known as the Donut Hole. This area was completely fished out in the 80s. I mean there is no fish life in this area, thanks to all the countries that fished the crap out of it. NOAA sends research teams yearly to this area to see if life is coming back to the area but hasn't seen much increase in the last 20 years.

Now on to educating the masses I can only speak to what I know which is what the United States is doing to prevent overfishing (Magnuson-Stevens Act) and what certain other countries are doing (WCPFC). I will touch briefly on both so as not to bore the masses but still educate.

Magnuson-Stevens Act was originally signed into US law in 1976. It was amended in 1996 and reauthorized in 2006. The basis for the law was to create 8 regional fisheries management councils who would restore depleted stocks and manage healthy stocks. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) would oversee the councils and report to the Secretary of Commerce. NMFS, which is part of NOAA, enforces these regulations through a multitude of laws and regulations depending upon gear type, boat type, species type, and area. NMFS along with the US Coast Guard enforce the federal fisheries in all regions.

The Western Central Pacific Fisheries Committee which is made up of over 40 countries who participate to some degree. The WCPFC was created to manage highly migratory fish in the Pacific Ocean. It was originally founded through the United Nations back in 1995. Now the laws that all of this are founded on are a bit on the confusing side even for those of us who have a little understanding of how they work.  Basically how it works is if a fishing boat is in international waters and sailing under a flag of one of the members, they are able to be boarded by law enforcement officials (who are flying the WCPFC flag) of any member of the WCPFC. Now, the LE officers will conduct an inspection of just the fish they are catching and send their reports back to the WCPFC who forward them onto the parent country of the boat. Now enforcement is up to the parent country which most stick to rather stringently. 

Now if there are any other questions about either, please ask. I have about 45 minutes of time right now but will be back in a few hours to answer them. I have been in the US Coast Guard for 9 years and have enforced fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico, Bering Sea and Pacific Ocean (under the WCPFC flag).

SoyBeanExplosion,Metal,1389685593.0,"Well, two of the black metal bands I've been listening to recently are Watain and Valkyrja. Valkyrja's latest album is phenomenal, though I'd argue their strongest song is Oceans to Dust from their first album - Watain's is pretty great but it's a bit more influenced by Bathory and traditional heavy metal bands. Both albums have pretty strong production. Wodensthrone are pretty great too, Curse is their better album IMO. You could try Lantlos and Alcest too; Inquisition's latest album (2013) is very popular around here and the production is very strong. Deathspell Omega - Paracletus and Agalloch - Ashes Against the Grain might be up your street too.

It depends what you mean by 'poor production quality' though. There's a very analog sound to all black metal recordings because, well, that's part of what makes black metal what it is. If it sounded like it was all played on a computer, or recorded all totally separately and mixed together like butter, it'd be shit IMO. You need a certain level of rawness, it's about getting that balance."
WeaponsGradeHumanity,WorldofTanks,1389685596.0,"The T1 Heavy and M6 are both great tanks.  The ""grind"" through them isn't painful at all.  
The strength of the T1 is the engine.  At the outset of the game, you have the power to put a heavy tank somewhere on the battlefield where the enemy isn't prepared to see one.  After that, you have the ability to relocate depending on the flow of battle.  The trick is to always place yourself somewhere you can dish out as much damage as possible without taking any in return.  You're also fast enough to exploit weaknesses in the enemy line so don't be afraid to get close and bully smaller tanks.  
The M6 isn't quite as fast but it's more heavily armed and armoured.  This is where you want to start getting hull-down practice in preparation for the T29.  Find a hill and peek over it to use your gun.  If you must expose your hull, do it at a careful angle depending on where the enemy are and the ratio of frontal armour to side armour.  Also keep in mind that your gun fires twice as fast as a number of other tier six weapons like the KV-1S' 122m D-2-5T.  This means that you should be looking for chances to set up favourable trades where you can get in two shots for their one.  
The T29 continues the trend of losing speed in return for armour, firepower and gun depression.  "

enlightened-giraffe,photography,1389685645.0,"For me it's been the only way for a long time, even for casual shooting, but PS is just too bothersome if you only shoot raw. Lightroom is much much faster and you can always hop to photoshop for more in-depth post.

RAW doesn't only give you an uncompressed file, it gives you a much more flexible file, anytime you give a bigger boost in any direction the raw will look much better and cleaner, noise reduction works better as well. 

It's important to avoid the hassle though, if you always have to spend hours in post you'll end up shooting less. Look up a good workflow tutorial for Lightroom, check out the default presets and look up others or even make your own (+30% shadows, -30% highlights, +20% clarity makes most photos look a bit better) and apply them in bulk, then review and make changes where you see fit, doing the same thing in PS would take much longer."

All of this rhetoric is missing facts, the frist wave of imigrants was large because there were a entire segment of upper lower class and low medium incomes that could not integrate into our transitional capitalism. 

The country needed only cheap workers and shady entrepreneurs. Because the environment was more wild west than western Eruope, these skilled(communist education is quite amazing) did not adapt and to the capital based economy and got unskilled jobs that paid better that their vocational job would have, but still not enough to offer them a decent living. 

So when the floodgates opened, everyone that had some small degree of competency flocked to italy and spain(smaller language barrier(the communist educational system was lacking in that department.) And either continued with their unskilled job or found a vocational or manufacturing job. 

This coincided with a export of middle high income programers and engineers that realised the huge difference in wages between Romania and the rest of the EU however because of their comprehension of english and/or german they preferred emigrating to northern Europe, Germany and some the Czech republic and Hungary. 

Now, back in romania the economy was changing, low skilled jobs were being outsourced, or upgraded, so a lot of people found themselves unemployed, so slowly these people started going westward, the model worked for spain and itally, because the high demand of labor during the holyday season, but not as much for germany and france.

CaspianX2,movies,1389686039.0,"&gt;A woman is trapped in a castle/tower, gets to leave for a short period until something goes wrong, and a surly misanthrope with a non-talking, yet emotive and anthropomorphized horse-like sidekick helps her to find true love and break a magical curse/spell that changes her hair color and eventually threatens her life.

You can find a way to make comparisons like this for just about any movie. For example, here's a plot description of Fight Club (I picked the first movie that came into my head):

&gt;The protagonist develops a split personality. At first, he doesn't even know it has happened, but over the course of the movie he begins talking to this split personality, and at one point even gets into a fistfight with it. At some point the protagonist worries that this split personality might hurt his female love interest. Meanwhile, the protagonist must also contend with a secret criminal organization that has members seemingly everywhere, even in the police! This criminal organization repeatedly threatens to harm the protagonist during the course of the movie, and when the female love interest is kidnapped by a member of the criminal organization, it all culminates in a showdown in a high structure that results in the protagonist getting shot but not killed, and then reuniting with the female love interest.

An even longer description than yours, right? And yet it also describes the plot of Me, Myself and Irene, which absolutely *no one* will ever confuse with Fight Club.

I'm not saying you don't have genuine arguments against Frozen, but they're all in your *next* paragraph. Comparing the plots of two movies in this way proves *nothing*, especially considering that the main story arc in Tangled is about a girl coming to terms with her own identity and realizing the abusive nature of her caretaker, and Frozen is really about two sisters learning to reconcile their differences and bridge the rift between them. And while they may share certain motifs (shut-ins, magic color-changing hair, non-verbal anthomorphized horse-like characters), the story arcs for the two movies are very different.

It is honestly in this last point that I feel is one of Frozen's biggest *weaknesses*. The characters in Tangled grow and change in a more clear fashion than the ones in Frozen, and where Tangled is pretty focused on its three main characters, Frozen gets a bit too distracted by the periphery (Olaf may have been a funny and memorable character, but he doesn't really do anything significant to advance the plot). Additionally, I always get frustrated with a movie when conflict is created simply because characters choose not to communicate with each other, and nearly all of Frozen's conflict comes from this. It might as well be called Failure To Communicate Kills: The Movie.

I still think Frozen is a good movie, and in particular I have great respect for Disney in choosing to give it the ending it had instead of going for the stereotypical ending that it ultimately was just dangling as a red herring. However, I do agree that Tangled was a more focused and cohesive film. But Frozen's problems really had nothing to do with the stuff in that paragraph.

The carbon foot print of a vegan is far less than a meat-eater.  And you're right, it gets more meaningful the more vegans there are.  

&gt;The resources consumed by one average omnivore in pursuit of animal protein would nourish as many as 10 vegetarians (there's lots of argument about this stat - some would put the ratio higher)

&gt;Because production of their [meat-eaters] protein is particularly demanding on fossil fuels – for fertiliser, processing, transport and so on.

&gt; Farming carnivores like salmon is fairly disastrous ecologically, and involves a similar waste of food resources to meat - it takes 3-5kg of other fish to produce 1kg of salmon.

http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/feb/24/vegetarianism-save-planet-safran-foer

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1389686591.0,"Well I appreciate the time it took you to write all of this! Granted, I skimmed it, but I'll pick out the important bits:

------------

&gt; I have previously posted this on the Warframe forums, where it belongs, but the mods have swept it under the rug, in which, I don't think that the community at large will go read 13 pages to see more letters.

That's a bit unfortunate, though I'm not sure that's entirely the case. Perhaps it was the format or structure of the post, the sheer number of posts similar to yours, or maybe even the scenario you described. Anyway, that's not your point so I won't dwell on it.

&gt; I’d say to rework some missions and (keep) reworking the bosses, all of them are great for the most part. The maps need more variety besides the tilepieces, why not alternate routes that cater to players who want to stealth their way?

They are working on more Stealth elements in normal gameplay, though it is a very interesting idea to bring that into the boss battles as well (like Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut).

&gt; I’d just rework some of the weapons; give them some uniqueness like an alternate means of fire, or make the weapons feel and sound powerful. This would give more meat to the weapons, making them feel different in their way.

Damage 2.0 has done some of the usefulness in terms of stats. Different weapons in the same category may now cater to different types of base damage (Impact, Puncture, Slash), to varying degrees of success. Everyone's got their opinions of it; I just think it's neat. I do agree with your need for better sounds. Nice punchy gunshot sounds are always appreciated! 

&gt; Much like the weapons, it has to be Damage-based, or it’s not going to make the mark. It’s usually Nova, Mag, Rhino, Vauban, or Frost for those jobs. While Frost or Vauban are not damage-based, Nova, Mag, and Rhino are. This presents in little variety of use in frames, making the other essentially stuck in a tier below sub-par. Every frame has their niche role, but these frames set the standard for being powerful in general.

&gt; their builds for each of them. Streamline, Flow, Focus, and, Redirection/Vitality. Done. This is what the builds have boiled down to nowadays.

These are good points. DE is working on Warframe rebalancing, so that will become less of an issue as we go along. Altering the Warframe stats to allow better builds... it's both a valid topic, but also not as big a problem as you might believe. Yes, I'm sure many players use your described build. I definitely do on some frames! But others, I have different strategies, or use other combinations that suit the playstyle better. Maybe I'm the minority, but everyone has their opinions on how to play certain frames, and it's free enough that people will actually argue over this, so there's definitely some customization going on!

&gt; But should there be any major change, I would think Mods 2.0 should be ousted in favor to skill trees – diverse builds for every warframe,

That's going into some heavy territory. I don't think the issue is so large that we'd need to make a change of that scale. I do understand where you're coming from though.

&gt; But this is only scratching a broad surface of things. Endgame and Earlygame. This is another trend being thrown up in air, however an update to this letter will ensue soon; I have run out of time to think of mental ideas for this topic, as I have to allot my time on other important tasks.

You really don't have to; there are a number of discussions on the topic that I'm sure your input would be welcome there.

----------------

DE's mantra for this next year is ""THE YEAR OF YES!"" All the exciting things they've been planning, as well as all the feedback they've been receiving, is finally going to be put into play as we see issues resolved, lore revealed, and patches released. There are many things that DE has to address, and it'll take time to get 'em all sorted out. We'll see what the future holds!

If your concerns aren't addressed in the next few patches, perhaps you should submit a question to the Livestream Question thread on the Forums (which should appear a day or two before the Livestream)."

I'm not attractive either and it's something I deal with on a daily basis.  However, I am very persistent on having good hygiene and being well groomed.  I think it's a very basic and simple step to feeling better about yourself.  After I take a shower and dry my hair, I feel infinitely better.

I'm a horrible dresser and I'd like to be better about that but I'd also like to get in shape a little bit before changing up my wardrobe.

It's just something you have to work with and know that looks will only go so far.  Looks are an instantaneous thing but... I don't deem that the only thing when I think of attractiveness."

Think about this. Nothing has changed except a number. She looks exactly the same before and after you learned it.

Necron_Overlord,Cascadia,1389686859.0,"&gt;You say that not having a military is a ""ridiculous proposition in the modern world"", but you don't actually give any valid reasons why we need a military.

Pirates.  Waves of immigrants fleeing the effects of global warming.  Keeping right wing militia groups from getting funny ideas.  Keeping ourselves from being annexed by America the second the south realizes they need us to keep their economy afloat.  Lots of reasons.

&gt; How about we mind our own damn business and send peace corps style volunteers if we feel like it.

Because isolationism is not a realistic response.

&gt; Disaster response? Sure, but again why a military? How about volunteer firefighters and doctors.

Doctors and firefighters don't deter looters.  Bullets do.

CaspianX2,movies,1389687038.0,"Yeah, the film could have lost the Ice Song that opens the movie, Reindeers Are Better Than People, Olaf's Summer song (despite how amusing it was), and the Fixer-Upper song, and combined the songs For the First Time in Forever and Love is an Open Door, and they wouldn't have lost anything significant to the film's plot *at all*.

By contrast, you can listen to the soundtrack to Disney's Beauty and the Beast and basically have the entire movie's plot told to you through song. There's not one song in that soundtrack you can dispense with without losing something important to the plot.

At the very least I think that Frozen's Do You Want to Build a Snowman and Let It Go are both good songs that are important to the plot, and Olaf's Summer song is, as I mentioned, at least amusing. But overall, yeah, I think that this film's dedication to shoehorning in unnecessary songs hurts both its pacing and plot cohesion.

I mean, when the audience is supposed to be concerned about the film's heroine dying, do we really want to be forced to sit through a bunch of grey smurfs singing about a relationship that neither of the protagonists are ready for yet?"

Bapoos,polandball,1389687121.0,"In the UK there are laws about keeping with the general architectural style of the area.  If you're building a new structure it has to blend with the other structures rather than be an eye sore.  Some boroughs are stricter than others with applying this law but still, there is a good reason for it.

A mosque, like the one our subreddit local Muslim is asking for, does not belong in Europe in any stretch of the imagination.  It's too foreign and wouldn't sit well with other structures in its neighbourhood.

The examples of architectural styles you mentioned, although different from one another, have evolved from one another, having a Gothic building next to a Romanesque one isn't going to hurt anyone's eyes.  Having a Gothic building next to an Eastern mosque like those photos posted in this thread, will.  If a mosque blends, then of course I wouldn't have a problem with it.

Second Rule of Being Steve - You have to do something excellent in her presence, thus demonstrating your sexual worthiness.

By giving up meat alone you are doing more than if you gave up all daily transportation.

Quincies have been living in hiding in SS the whole time.  The king of the Quincies comes back to life after about 1,000 years.  Ichigo's dad is not only a shiba but a former captain of the 10th division.  Aizen did in fact play a role in molding Ichigo's powers (at least his hallow powers), Ichigo's mother was a quincy.  So Ichigo is part hallow, quincy, and soul rapest.

The quincies come out of hiding and start the 3rd reich.  SS gets its' ass handed to them primarily due to the quincy's ability to steal bankais.   Yamoto and his latin friend die in honorable combat.  Shinsui loses an eye and becomes the new captain commander.

The royal guard comes down to remind the gotei 13 of what a horrible job they did but offer some help in regards to a few characters (Ichigo included). Unohana is ordered to train Kenpachi and help him release dat bankai.  During this period of training we learn Unohana was the original Kenpachi and the person that Zarakai has been determined to defeat since childhood.  The conclusion of this fight is kind of up in the air, but Zarakai may have learned his zanpakuto's name.

Meanwhile at the royal guard palace, Ichigo enjoys a nice spa treatment by elvis.  Learns about his parents and the powers he inherits from Kanye West.  We learn that ""Old Man Zangetsu"" is actually the part of the Quincy King's soul just kind of hiding out until it's time to russel jimmies again or something.  All the members of the royal guard were appointed their positions because they brought significant improvements to ss and the gotei 13.  Kanye West basically invented zanpakutos.  He helps Ichigo forge his new one which is basically two smaller butcher knives.

Anti-whistleblower bills effectively block anyone from exposing animal cruelty, food-safety issues, poor working conditions, and more in factory farms. These bills can also suppress investigations into cruel horse soring, mistreatment of animals in laboratories, and other abuses. These bills could do this by:

&gt;Banning taking a photo or video of a factory farm without permission,
Essentially making it a crime for an investigator to get work at a factory farm, or
Requiring mandatory reporting with impossibly short timelines so that no pattern of abuse can be documented."

The thing that causes suffering is you feeling like you have these big expectations to make something of yourself here and now. Or at least, that's how it was for me. And I didn't see a clear path to that, or even the first steps to that really, and it caused me to despair often. 

Maybe it's a bit too zen, but obviously there is going to be a lot in your life that you can't control. There will be decisions in your life that take you to places you didn't expect. Trite stuff, but true. You'll keep probing at the question and things will happen and you'll start to get to where you need to go. Or, you'll get somewhere that you completely didn't expect and you'll find that you enjoy or are content with something that before wasn't even on your radar. 

The thing about working out though, for me at least, is that it wasn't really this big revelation. I'm sure some people have that big make or break moment where they get something that really changed the tide in their life, but I never got that. It was more of a steady trot to where I felt like I needed to go. And it also never ends. I'm still progressing on that route, and I still get frustrated, daily. It's just living. 

23 is just too young to really be fretting about if your life is going to matter. because really, that's the main fret, isn't it? You want to do something worthwhile. My advice for you is to keep doing stuff you enjoy, keep poking at this question but don't agonize over it. It's not magic, and it won't appear to you overnight (unless you're one of the lucky ones who gets the revelation/big-break). it's just accepting that not knowing and going anyway is pretty much how you have to live life if you don't want to be miserable.

above all, enjoy it. find a way to enjoy the uncertainty and how fucked up you feel like you are and you'll be leaps and bounds above everyone else. because people who made it in a career aren't necessarily happier than those around them, either. 

enjoy it! it sucks. it's awesome. it's a lot of things. and a lot of us have been there too, and are right there with ya.

oh, edit to add that I was such a fuck up in college, since you seem to be stressing about your past. oh man. You said you had a lackluster internship; well I slept through all my classes and quit the internship I had by not showing up one day without a call or email. Still, life is pretty satisfying to me. Keep going!

CaspianX2,movies,1389687853.0,"To add to this, Jar Jar Binks fails because his humor is all immature slapstick with an annoying accent.

Olaf succeeds because the humor of his character comes from one of two places - 1. That he is extremely, childishly naive, and 2. Visual humor using the fact that he's a living snowman.

Number 1 *could* be annoying, except that the naivete is so over-the-top (he even sings a song about wanting to do ""whatever frozen things do in Summer"") that it plays with being surprisingly dark for a children's film, and the other characters are fully aware of this and their reactions help to build *their* characters (""I want to tell him."" ""Don't you dare!""), and by going as far with this naivete as they do they are able to build this childlike innocence into something insightful in its own way, which helps to build the plot later on.

As for number 2, while Jar Jar may have stumbled around and hurt himself like an idiot, the visual humor for Olaf is far more original, and is closer to the sort of visual humor we got from Mr. Potato Head in Toy Story 3 during the tortilla scene - playing around with what a character like that would be physically capable of that other characters wouldn't.

Olaf is a much, much, much better character than Jar Jar Binks. There's no comparison here."

All dating and thinking about relationships does is create stress in my life and trivialize how awesome I am at a lot of other things. At first this I'm just going to love me and not let any guys in my life was more of a mantra than  reality. And I still have pangs of loneliness, but I'm happy and feeling great and empowered in a whole new way. There's nothing wrong with being alone. And when I think about it, I love it. All the fun, all the new experiences are ahead of me. I'm not compromising to placate my feelings of loneliness. I'm alone because I'm better that way.

However, when it comes to cultural assumptions about behavior between genders, there are some ridiculous assumptions about the differences between women and men that are more traditional than they are accurate.

Also, there is no data that links male and female physiology to career success in particular areas. The only real difference is the XY and XX chromosomes, which also come in other groupings (XX, XXX, and XXY) and are essentially a switch for determining the type of hormones a fetus is delivered, and subsequently the child as they grow. The different hormonal balance leads to some phenotypical differences between the sexes, but the capabilities of humans should not be constructed on gender lines.

Logically follows as... if an A is more X than a B on average, there may still be some Bs that are more X than some As. Therefore, it is actually wrong to say As *are* more X than Bs. Even more infringing to write policy based on a faulty inference like this."

I'm sure he will be more than happy to work with you on this game. What you've done here is pretty much discourage anyone that was looking to buy it, and doesn't know better.

I recommend to just start with a local beer with a medium alcohol content. If you don't like it, try a different beer or a white wine.

Moderation is key. When you feel like you've got a pleasant buzz going on, don't order another alcoholic drink: it will likely make you feel worse instead of better. Just get a coke or something. When you've finished your coke and you're still good to go, feel free to get another alcoholic beverage. You still need to discover your limit, so err on the side of not puking on yourself."

As for a Spanish ship doing that, there is no one to stop them. But they wouldn't profit much from sailing all the way to the pacific and back. Many of the countries in the area where they can go to refuel or sell their catch, won't take them in because of the country's membership."

Sui-Feng fights a robot-knight.  We learn Komamura is from a werewolf clan, he's forced to fight a little girl, he barely wins and turns into a dog in his attempt to beat up a little girl.  His friend MC Hammer (if you're too young to know who MC Hammer is google that shit) is there for support.

While all the captains that had their bankais stolen are fighting the quincies who stole them.  Urahara comes just in time with a solution involving a fusion of hollow spirit energy that the quincies can't control.  This leads to the captains getting their bankais back.  Great success!

Shinji, Rose and Kensei are fighting this one quincy who is a German luchador. Despite being captain class vizords they can't beat this guy.  I'm going to go on a rant because I really like these guys and they've yet to win a fight which is kind of annoying.

EDIT: more detailed
http://i.imgur.com/NtuZXGX.jpg

I'll focus on your fear of the effects of this on your future relationships and how you should mitigate those effects. Basically, at an instinctual level, 1) men are highly territorial and 2) very personal about how their mates perceive them(females are the choosers in primates, men want the females to view them as alpha). The first one has mostly been mitigated by environmental factors like social norms and their upbringing but still causes unease in most, and those probably will cease the relationship if they're not comfortable with it. Move on.

Those that continue it will face their biggest problem in the second thing, manifesting as insecurity. 

Many men, if they're ok that you've had many partners, will still have insecurity about how they compare to your partners. If they feel wanted, sexually and emotionally, and like they compare favourably in your eyes, they'll probably be ok with your history too. Otherwise, feelings of emasculation, irrational anger and frustration are not uncommon. 

Very little of any of this occurs at a conscious level.

That said, you will have a very hard time finding men who don't care about your sexual past and who also want a long term relationship.

[Ballast Point Yellowtail Pale Ale](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/199/696/) - Closest to the Efes style, a light yet still delicious beer that can be drunk all day in hot weather. Refreshing and delicious. 

[Racer 5 IPA](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/610/2751/) - A very drinkable IPA. Widely available in Southern California. Offers a lot of flavor but is restrained and mellow enough that you can drink them all night long.

[Lagunitas IPA](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/220/916/) - Similar to Racer 5, but kicks up the hops and the malt by a notch. May be a bit strong to drink a bunch of them but its perfect when you want a full flavored brew.

[Stone Smoked Porter](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/147/90/) - May fit better in the ""Casual"" category since its very drinkable and low alcohol, but I find myself sticking to one whenever I drink Stouts or Porters.

[Alesmith Speedway Stout](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/396/3833/) - A worldclass beer, rated one of the best produced in the US. Very strong at 12% ABV. Not something you can drink all night but an incredible experience when you're in the mood for something big and heavy.

[Left Coast Hop Juice](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/10046/38515/) - This one takes the IPA style and turns the hops and malt up to an 11. Delicious in small doses, but too full flavored to drink all night.

Most of these are from California and I haven't seen any of them here in Izmir. The best beer with decent distribution here is the standard Duvel (belgian). Other Belgian beers/Breweries I like but which are not as widely available here are Afligem, Kasteel Tripel, Chimay, and Westmalle. Good luck!"

Like the time when I texted her saying ""hey,"" then the nurse came in to give me another shot of Dilaudid (FANTASTIC fucking stuff btw), then a few minutes later I was woken up by another nurse coming in to check my blood pressure. Except I didn't know it was only a few minutes later. I thought it was an hour or two later. So preemptively (and without checking to see if she'd responded to me) I texted her, ""sorry if I didn't respond, ive been knocked out since the last text,"" and proceeded to hit ""send"" before my brain had caught up and said ""hey check a fucking clock before you send this"" but by then it was too late.

YouBWrong,comicbooks,1389689707.0,"I was having similar thoughts this morning.  The problem with guys like this is that they have no appreciation for these characters.  They are great characters with rich possibilities.  The fact that some superhero movies fails is not because the character fails but rather despite the characters.  

That said, I don't think that the writer is more at fault than the strategists behind DCs current push.  They actually do see this as some kind of race with the Marvel camp.  And they'd better put in the first string as soon as they can because there's no point in taking risks.  

Meanwhile Marvel is developing some of the most obscure properties in either universe with great success.  

I guess the lesson here is that if you see this all as a money making venture then you're going to make some money.  If you see it as an artistic venture and try to squeeze as much of these great stories onto the screen as possible for the sake of the characters and the fans, then you'll make a great movie (and probably a shit ton of money)."

It's not a super sexual show, but we did get to see a bit of their personal lives (as well as others', like McNulty, for example) but not in a way that was gratuitous or anything.

But I guess I am saying it is the opposite of your example: if you are there burning down houses (while smoking a cigarette) I can pretty much say I don't feel guilt for only smoking.

But the person you were originally replying to said he didn't have to feel guilty about overfishing.  Which is true.  You replied with he should still feel guilty for driving, etc.  That is when I pointed out not eating meat is a much larger factor than even all *transportation* combined when it comes to global warming.  

But there is no reason to think he is being reckless environmentally at all.  It is more common for vegans to be more environmentally conscious in general.

Yes, if the person you were originally replying to was ACTUALLY leaving on the AC all day with the heater running and had dozens of lights that he didn't turn off that would be one thing, but nothing of the sort was said.

And I thought you were referring to me as the ""thought I was better than everyone.""  But still, I don't see that too much with who you replied to.  He said he has no guilt about overfishing and such because he doesn't support the industry."
EnergyCritic,AskFeminists,1389690369.0,"Feminism has some core tenets, and then every feminist has their own opinions about how they should be applied. Most feminists fall into a category of some sort that stems from these core elements. 

Essentially, just like all other world-view/political/philosophical movements.

And yes, it's not a club nor a government nor an official organization.

&gt;So when feminist on this subreddit and /r/feminism say that the definition of a feminist is someone who believes in equality for women, they are describing every rational person in the world.

So we'd hope.

Feminism is not just the belief in equality for women but a set of core understandings of the nature of how women are disadvantaged currently, and have been much more disadvantaged historically, at the hands of something known as ""patriarchy"". Believing in gender equality isn't enough to be a feminist, but identifying as a feminist, adopting the core understandings, and being able to articulate your understanding at least a bit is all there really is to becoming a feminist. There is at least some sort of duty to spread the word associated with the movement aspect of feminism, but yea, it's not unlike any other movement.

&gt;If, hypothetically, there was a correct definition of equality, and a person supported that type of equality, one group of people (let's say /r/feminism) would call that person a feminist. However, another group wit a different interpretation of a 'feminist' (let's say /r/mensrights) would call that person an egalitarian. Neither group of people would be wrong in this instance. I think that when groups like /r/mensrights refer to 'feminism' they are referring specifically to radical feminism, which means think that the average subscriber to /r/mensrights is not misogynistic if they speak negatively of femism, nor do I think someone subscribed to /r/feminism is misandric if they refer to /r/mensrights in a negative way.

This is all based on the assumption that feminists proclaim that you *become* a feminist when you believe in equality, which they aren't... so I'm confused about the purpose of this model you have created and what exactly you are trying to say."

you can have qualifications coming out of your ears, but if you lack the ability to engage and associate with either gender as per the rest of the professional world you will always be marginalised as an outcast.

Many colleges make the mistake in thinking that special rules that would never be allowed to exist in the ""Outside world"" should apply to them, yet seem oblivious to notion that this massively undermines the capability and professional maturity of its members.

I guess for me it's because I spend so much time thinking about how terrible I am and how much I hate myself that I just kind of assume that's how everyone else sees me too, so it's rather overwhelming when people say or do things to show that they believe otherwise about me. I also sometimes question them and wonder if they're being honest. In the end, it just makes me feel really uncomfortable...partly because it's overwhelming, partly because it's hard to believe, and partly because I feel like I don't deserve it.

""I touch no one and no one touches me"" was a lyric by Paul Simon, but in truth no man is an island, as John Donne pointed out. Is your isolation by design or a consequence of some other factors?

I know this sounds cynical, but pets can help build relationships, both through shared experience (meeting people while walking the dog) and through receiving unconditional love.

But pets can't hug you? Yes, but they can help build empathy, and if you don't care if others live or die, it may well be that you have erected some shields to protect you, or that you are a low responded, and really don't care.

If you miss human contact, get a hobby, meet some others, and ask them some questions, and try to see the best in them. They may just surprise you! I wish you well."

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389692484.0,"I think it's great that you are doing this, and starting out easy (relaxing on restaurant bread) is a good idea.

Other people will come in with great advice, and make sure you look at other similar posts (since it is a quiet hour here on reddit), so here is just a few random things:

Give yourself boosts about why you are doing this.  Watch Forks over Knives with your family.  Watch the great episode of Dr. Oz and Rocco the Cowboy who reversed his diabetes in 28 days with going vegan.  Read about the Engine 2 diet and how an entire Fire Company reversed their health.  

Make sure you get your essential nutrients.  Instead of a margarine spread, try flax oil (and a bit of salt) instead of melted butter.  It is great on toast, popcorn, baked potatoes, etc.  It is also a great way to get your super important Omega-3 fats.  Take B-12 supplements.  And everyone, not just vegans, need D3 (look for veg versions).

Peruse recipe websites for inspiration.  I love fatfreekitchen blog.  She also has a way to search for certain types of recipes.  ""Eat to Live"" is especially healthful eating for people with health conditions.  I heard ""Ohsheglows"" is a good site.  Once again, search posts for more.  

Find an easy, everyday breakfast.  I like Food for Life English Muffins with flax oil and salt and blueberries.  Many people love oatmeal or just fruit and peanut butter.  You don't have time to think in the mornings.  

Keep snack food and back up food when you are tired or hungry.  Snacks can be apples and peanut butter, carrot sticks and hummus, avocado on Wasa crackers with balsamic and S&amp;P or just a handful of almonds.  Backup food are cans of vegan chili or soup, Indian food pouches, frozen veggie burgers, etc.  So when you are hungry you don't ""break""

Know what you crave and find substitutes.  Post here, people will have great ideas.  Make your favorite meals, just veggie style.  There are a dozen posts for what to do for cheese and eggs.  

Okay, it's late!  Ask more if needed!  Congrats and good luck!"

It still confuses the heck out of me. I love it!"
HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1389692497.0,"Each and every snippet of advice in that link is Classic Hamster Feed. Observe:

&gt;It’s not entirely about you.

**Translation:** You have free license to shift blame! That means blame your boring boyfriend, blame the alpha cock that pumped and dumped you, blame society, blame that nosy bitch in the next cubicle! Find a convenient target and let loose with your ire! It's NEVER your fault!

&gt;A man will either like you or not. And that is mostly entirely up to them, not up to you.

**Translation:** There's absolutely no correlation between self-improvement and finding a man! There's no need to develop feminine qualities, or useful skills, or a personality of any kind!

So go ahead! Bury your fist in that bag of Cheetos! The right guy will fall into your lap eventually! They're *supposed to*!

&gt;You have to go out there and get what you want, instead of staying stuck in something you don’t want.

**Translation:** There's no reason to work on resolving problems, or to negotiate, or to compromise when you have an unpleasant and messy argument with your boyfriend/husband!

Compromising is hard to do, and you should NEVER do anything that's hard!

If your *feels* tell you right now that you're unhappy, go out and find someone who will make your pussy tingle! Ideally, do this to a rapid succession of partners and associated social circles, leaving a trail of fire in your wake!

Remember, no one is allowed to shame you for it!

&gt;...you can’t somehow stop yourself from holding on to something that “almost was” love. But the reason it didn’t work out because it wasn’t love that was nurturing the relationship in the first place.

**Translation:** True Love™ is supposed to be eternal. So if you fall out of love with your partner at any point, it wasn't True Love™ to begin with! No love, no relationship; therefore your partner count is technically still low!

With this rationalization in your arsenal, you now have a blank cheque to fuck, suck, and jerk every dick you can get an orifice around, guilt-free!

&gt;You’ve made a mistake because you yearn for a loving relationship—which is but natural for all human beings to long for. So forgive yourself and don’t look at loving **the wrong person** as a weakness

**Translation:** Men pump and dump you. But it's not because you lack redeeming qualities. It's not your fault. They're just the wrong guys - and the only reason you love the wrong guys is because you've just got so much love to give. It means you're strong, and getting stronger!

Each alpha dick that pushes your vaginal walls ever-wider builds character!

**The key here is that women think ""beating myself up"" and ""feeling bad"" are the same thing.** They're so unaccustomed to feeling discomfort or dissatisfaction of any kind, that they readily (even willfully) misinterpret momentary discomfort as the greatest tragedy of their lives. They don't know what real unhappiness feels like - and it's all our fault. Us. Men.

We indulge women far too much. We set down our tomahawks, even on the war path, just to feed the laziness of our women.

That's why, when training a woman to behave properly, one of the best tactics is to get her to feel good about being denied what she thinks she wants. A woman demands something: you shut her down, establish your dominion, and she finds herself strangely attracted to the idea of NOT getting what she wants. 

""How can this be? I'm denied my special accommodation, and yet I don't feel in danger or wanting for anything. He must be a master of his environment.""

""I must fuck this man."""

As I slowly slipped myself underneath the thick and soft quilt, his snoring stopped but he remained motionless. I paused for a while fearing that I might wake up him but later his snoring returned and I successfully laid myself comfortably beside him. 

I couldn't sleep. My mind was still racing wandering about things that doesn't matter eventhough my body was exhausted. That's the cost of insomnia. Hearing the clock ticking through the silence of the room, I tried hard not to stir around in bed too much. He needed his sleep. 

After looking at the ceiling for approximately half an hour, I decided to turn on my DSlite for a little Mario Kart adventure. Maybe that will make my eyes and mind tired, so I can fall asleep. Slowly turning my body to my side, my back is now facing his. 

As I was choosing between Yoshi and Mario, I felt his hand gently touching my back, slowly reaching towards the front and then lowered to my nether region. He pulled my my hips towards him, I felt his warmness of his skin in the dry and cold night, and of course, his hard and raging boner. 

He slipped off my underwear swiftly. Before I managed to put down the gaming device and attempted to turn around to face him, I felt his breath on the nape of my neck as he whispered: ""No, I want you to play the game while I fuck you."" 

Slightly confused, I chose Yoshi and started my first round of Mario Kart while he pushed himself into me. I moaned as he kept thrusting into me, arching my back and pulling my hair. 

I wanted to give in to the carnal pleasure and stop the game but he disallowed it. So, there I was, getting fucked while losing rounds and rounds of Mario Kart as Yoshi. "

noname725,selfharm,1389692711.0,"1. I think that what you're describing sounds like it might be anxiety-related or something similar to that. It sounds like you start to feel that sick feeling when you realize that you haven't self-harmed in a while, and then the realization inspires a negative emotion (anxiety? something similar?), which causes the physical sick feeling. Our emotions and anxieties can definitely affect us physically as well. That's just my guess anyway. Perhaps you feel psychologically dependent on self-harm, perhaps you find it comforting... Obviously I can't speak for you, but these are just some guesses of mine. I could be way off!

2. People typically get stitches to reduce scarring and/or to close up a wound that is gaping and might need help with healing. I've read that if you can't push the two sides of the cut together to close the wound, then you should get stitches. It's kind of a personal discretion, though, I guess. I've never gotten stitches even though I probably should've many, many times...but that isn't necessarily a good thing. Just try to stay safe and take care of yourself. "

Here are some of the genetic tests they *should* or *probably will* test you for, given your history:  

*  Factor V - From [this website] (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/factor-v-leiden-thrombophilia): *""Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is an inherited disorder of blood clotting. Factor V Leiden is the name of a specific gene mutation that results in thrombophilia, which is an increased tendency to form abnormal blood clots that can block blood vessels.""* It is the most common genetic mutation; 3 out of 8 people have it. 

* MTFR (I refer to it as the motherfucker mutation because the acronym lends itself to it): Can cause some clots due to wacky enyzmes in the bloodstream. My hematologist sorta described it as the body having a bunch of Pac Mans (enzyme eating cells) eating the ghosts (enzymes) and with this mutation you don't have any Pac Mans. You can read more about it [here] (http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/MTHFR).  

* Prothrombin 20210 mutation: Like Factor V, this mutation can cause all sorts of funky things to happen with the blood. It was described to me as making my blood ""too sticky"" and it sorts of snowballs into clots. You can read about it more [here] (http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/110/3/e15.full).  

A hematologist (a good one at any rate) should explain what gene mutations are and how it affects the body. There are quite a few tests that can indicate what doctor's refer to determine if a patient is ""likely"" to develop blood clots. I have them all; sometimes, 2 mutated chromosomes in the same gene! I imagine that my blood is like maple syrup in my veins.

Family history is very important and it's good to know your history and let your siblings know what mutations you have as well. I am a triplet and I was very worried about my sister who was on Yaz. Turns out, out of my three siblings (an older sister and my triplet brother and sister), only my triplet sister had some of the same mutations. So, as I see, it was a mixed bag.

I really thought that I'd be done with this behavior by now, but here I am. 

It's frustrating that it's treated as purely a 'teen thing' or like it's a new phenomenon...when really it's a problem that goes way back into history and can affect adults as well as teens (and people of all genders, races, sexual orientations, etc.). There is a dearth of information and understanding about self-harm in general, and it'd be nice if what is already out there could include people of all ages.

Now the (2) is harder (actually it's not), because there is no way to record a dream. So you either believe me if I tell you a dream of mine or you don't. It won't really matter if you believe me, because it most likely has no impact on your life. I mean, I can't even prove you that I ate an apple an hour ago. Doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

To get to the religious part, guess we've all seen the fights over the imaginary friends. So it can have pretty real impacts on one life, if you believe the wrong guy. Even if (1) isn't even proven in any way."

A slut is a woman with a high partner count. But it's not the high partner count that's the problem. Rather, the high partner count is indicative that there's something wrong with her.

See, if a woman is good relationship material (feminine, empathetic, supportive, loving, etc.) then she'll get LTRed, usually in a committed monogamous relationship.

While she's in that committed LTR, her partner count holds firm. As a result, the kinds of women who are worth LTRing have low partner counts.

On the other hand, a woman lacking in qualities will usually get pumped and dumped. She's not enticing enough to be turned into a girlfriend, so she gets fucked and forgotten. And each time this happens, her partner count goes up.

So you see, it's not the high partner count per se, but rather what that number says about her suitability as a LTR."

I post there on another account sometimes too, and it's frustrating sometimes because there are occasionally some REALLY good discussions. Sometimes people post some really intriguing, insightful stuff...stuff that makes you think, makes you laugh, makes you feel like you can relate, etc. Overall I like the moderating team - they're pretty nice and they're quick to remove tasteless posts with gendered slurs and whatnot.

Buuuuut then sometimes it's just terrible, and there are some frequent MRA and /r/AskMen (which is often a cesspool, to be honest, though I admittedly haven't looked at it in months) trolls that make it hard to enjoy yourself on there. There's sometimes lots of mansplaining, and sometimes it's quite clear that (likely) guys are upvoting just what they want to hear and downvoting honest answers simply because they don't like them.

There was the usual batshit insane plot that MGS is known for, but you never had to wonder what was going on with Snake, or what his personal motivations were, in those games. 

Whereas MGS2, and especially its legacy within the game community and the series itself, is known for its postmodern story and themes. There is a great amount of characterization for Solidus Snake, but not so much for Raiden himself, due to the plot's unreliability of information. Coupled with the fact that players generally disliked Raiden in comparison to Snake, and you're left with a game that had tremendous lasting impact, but barely anyone really remembers the game fondly."

Hatewrecked,JusticePorn,1389694467.0,"But there's a legitimate difference between homosexual porn and heterosexual porn in the eyes of a child. That mandatory sex ed class in 5th grade never taught kids about bareback anal or handjobs, and a lot of parents don't have ""the birds and the birds"" talks with their kids. Any twelve year old would know that the guy puts his penis into the girl's vagina, and so when they watch heterosexual porn it's not a mystery (depending on the porn, of course). But with homosexual porn, there are no girls or vaginas in the equation, so the porn is by default a little bit more ""experimental."" So when these same kids watch videos of gay anal, blowjobs, handjobs, circlejerks or rimjobs or whatever the hell they're watching, they could be legitimately confused about it. Honestly, if I was a thirteen year old kid, I'd be more confused about male-to-male handjobs than I would be about some hetero fetishes like bondage or gloryholes or whatever. I honestly don't even think I realized gay guys can actually fuck until I was maybe 15 years old.

So anyway, yes homosexual porn would naturally be a bit confusing or misleading to a child who barely understands sex as it is, so in this case it is okay to throw ""fetish"" in with ""gay."""

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389694624.0,"&gt;all the same UKIP consider the EU to be oppressive towards their interests, and technically they are not wrong. oppression as a word does not carry strong meaning outside of such a context.

That kind of ""oppression"" does not justify stealing from EU, especially that again, UK joined EU, not the other way around and UK has full legal rights to leave EU. It just needs to vote for a party which will do so. No point for UKIP to ""sabotage"" EU.

&gt;because you would want to bring down the entire religion in order to make sure they cannot force you to do a damn thing

Why would I bring down whole religion in the whole world??? Are you mad? Just because some Muslims are terrorists would I have to bring down whole religion where at least 90% of people within that religion are normal people? The same works for EU. Just because some laws imposed by EU someone regards as unfair, he doesn't have any right to milk that party just because of his personal beliefs. He has a right to fight with it but not by joining them. After all, why would I even try to collapse whole religion to ban wearing bhurka in a country where people don't mind wearing it? It's their thing and if they don't like it they will vote against it. Same with Farage, he can look at UK's politics, don't pretend to be a saviour of Europe just because he's one of very few who thinks EU is a mad institution.

&gt;no you would be joining that panel to try and mitigate the damage they can do to your country's sovereignty, and you wouldn't want to bother talking about the issues of who the best prophet was, and all this after campaigning to be elected democratically into the panel of muslims on the promise of doing exactly that

That is again stupid and isn't different from scum behaviour of sabotaging and similar. THIS IS NOT A WAR! Even when an employee from one company is sent to the other to ""spy"" on them this isn't right. It simple lacks morals but nor Farage, nor his supporters have many morals left (look at UKIP supporters response in Farage's statement about accepting war refugees)."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389695627.0,"&gt;that's right everything that disagrees with your political view is nationalism, extremism, and/or terrorism, if they win those seats that's what the people in those areas wanted

They are nationalists, most of them. The same applies to BNP and even recent article from the internal UKIP forums said that at least 80% of BNP supporters will most probably join UKIP. I'm sorry, if someone from the party says so, there is something dodgy going on. Cameron wants to reform EU and even quit it if people vote for that. He doesn't behave like a typical nationalist twat, like Farage does. Have you read Farage's manifesto regarding immigrants? Look:

* EU citizens who have been established in the UK for seven years or more will, depending on their circumstances, be able to apply for permanent leave to remain (provided they fulfil certain criteria and are eligible to apply for work permits).*

Do you know what it means? Not hard to guess it means deporting all who have been in UK for less than 7 years but came LEGALLY under EU law. If that's not racist (deporting someone only because of nationality, whatever his situation is in UK and sole fact he came here legally) is fucking VERY wrong.

&gt;sure but using power achieved by the democratic process is not at all like killing people you don't like, and in history it was certainly not done by winning a democratic vote and using the seat as a part of a cynical self serving protest.

All would be fine if at least Farage donated money to charity. At least fucking half of it!!! He makes ""cynical"" protest but uses that money. Would you take free money knowing it came from drug selling? Plenty of people would and wouldn't find any problem with it, no moral compassion. I would probably take... but would donate all of it to a charity helping drug users.

&gt;not very many people do

Not many in percentage. Many in numbers (like whole cities). *The BNP put forward candidates for 338 out of 650 seats for the 2010 general election[148] gaining 563,743 votes*

Funnily, BNP doesn't have ""many"" supporters but when 700k Poles come into UK - FUCKING FLOODS OF IMMIGRANTS. Nice rhetoric.

&gt;well I'm sure a UKIP supporter would say the same about you.

They would probably say so but mainly because they do indeed lack brains. My goals are liberal and not liberal-extreme. UKIP is pretty much far right extreme (not as extreme as BNP though - at least officially). Deporting people just because of their nationality is generally wrong and you have a hint they plan doing so as described above. Supporting BNP is even worse as the party is clearly racist and yes, they would also say the same about me (that I must lack brains) but I'm not against people just because of their origin and because British race is the greatest. Some people should do more reading, for example about Nazis or Apartheid and visit some places (like death camps at Poland) so they could feel to their bones what being far right nationalist person is like. I bet most of them stay in their cosy homes and haven't even seen a foreign national personally but have the most to say about them and the whole topic."

silverionmox,changemyview,1389696855.0,"&gt;Marijuana use in high school students is currently on the rise, increasing as laws relaxing marijuana prohibition continue to be passed. Could be there causation between the two?

Given that the cannabis usage is lower in the Netherlands than in neighbouring Belgium (where it's more punishable and harder to get): no.

&gt;While its use may be relatively harmless to adults, it can have a number of damaging effects to the health of a developing mind

This is true for a wide range of substances and practices (alcohol, television, sugar,...). Using them responsibly is a matter of education and upbringing, not legality.

&gt;What do people suspect will happen once we take marijuana out of the hands of criminals? That they will hang up their life of crime and get a real job?

If they want to keep trading marihuana, that's exactly what they'll do.

But you assume that criminals are criminal because they are innately so... I disagree, but even assuming it's true, then they will be criminals whatever we legislate. So it's irrelevant for us to decide on legalisation.

&gt;gateway drug

Legalisation would prevent people from becoming familiar with illegal distribution networks. It would make the threshold higher again.

&gt;Nobody can convince me that this isn't going to result in an increased amount of people getting behind the wheel of a car while under the influence. This isn't just a case of ""live and let live"".

Ban cars, prevent all car accidents. Sorry for the facile argument ad absurdum, but it really boils down to this. A riskless existence can only be found in a coffin. We should aim never to drive under influence, regardless which and how many and how cheap the available intoxicating substances are."

However, when I was younger, even a few years ago, I would have been pretty devastated. At that point, I wasn't too confident in my ability to pleasure a woman, so it would have been the confirmation of my worst fears. Now I KNOW I'm good in bed, so I wouldn't assume it was my fault.

I think your best chance is to abjectly apologize for lying and promise never to do it again, but also insist that you love having sex with him anyway. Don't let him think that just because you weren't really cumming you didn't like it. You were absolutely enjoying yourself. That way, even if he breaks up with you, you've planted the seed of the idea that women can experience pleasure in more than one way, which is an idea he'll find useful in the future, and which also happens to be true.

In addition to almost 7 years as a confessed meme addict, I had moderated the largest meme forum on the Internet (at over 3 million subscribers) for over 3 years. You think I don't know memes? In that time I had removed over 4,000,000 posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I was one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how did I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups.

Dsf192,TruePokemon,1389698316.0,"Here's how Destiny Knot works...

It *randomly* chooses a combo of 5IVs from ***either parent*** and passes them.  Always 1 random draw.

For Example: Your Seadra (we'll assume it's male for the sake of example) is 12/29/22/06/18/17 and ditto is 31 x6, as we know..  The Destiny Knot may choose this spread of EVs to pass down:

M/M/F/M/F/X.  Then your offspring is going to look like.. 12/29/31/06/31/X.  The X can be any number between 0 and 31.  The spread passed down to offspring (M/M/F/M/F/X in this example) changes by egg.  So the next one might be F/M/M/X/F/F.

 Your best option is to take (if your Seadra has no IVs) one of the offspring with 2/3 IVs and then breed that with the Ditto.  Then take a newly bred one with 3/4IVs and breed that.  Then hopefully get a 5IV.  At best there's a 1/32 chance to get a 31 in the random slot.  So good luck."
PandaDerZwote,explainlikeimfive,1389698324.0,"Inflation means decrease of buying power for every dollar you own.  
If we have a market which is filled with goods and today there are 100 things to buy and 100 dollars to pay for it, 1 dollar per good would sound plausible. Now they next week, there are 110 goods (because economy grew) but 120 dollars to spend, money is now worth less, inflation happened.

This can have multiple causes, but first of all, you must understand why inflation is not bad for the economy and (partly) desired. Our system is depending on the flow of money. It will stagnate when nobody is buying or selling and because of that, it would be convenient to give a little impulse to people to rather spend their money than to hoard it. Inflation does exactly that. If my money today is worth 100$ and next year the same amount will buy me the same stuff 95$ will buy me this year and if I am rational, I will buy the machine that costs a lot of money this year instead next year. Thats the exakt same reason why deflation is bad. If my money is worth more tomorrow than it is today, I won't spend it today and no spending means hurting the economy.  

The source of inflation is highly debated. For starters, the goverment can increase the amount of money faster than the ""market"" increases and gives possibilities to spend your money (like described above) to inflate it artificialy. But it happens ""naturally"" too, if the economy grows there will be more demand, which leads to higher prices or the other way around higher prices means higher waages means higher prices means higher waages, it's almost vicious. There are other reasons for it too, like the fact that a company wont hesitate to raise prices (when oil is expensive for example) but it will only lower the prices of something every so slowly if it costs them less to make."

- When the companies lose money they fire the young employees with a temporary contract than the older ones with an indefinite contract. If you have an indefinite contract in Spain the company has to pay up to 45? days per year worked.

- Spanish banks are very reluctant to give credits, so the companies can't invest on new projects, which would help on making new employments.

- A lot of people on their 20s left their studies when they were 16 to work in the construction. When the crysis started, they found out that their expertise was no longer needed. If there aren't any buildings to build, there aren't jobs not only for the builders, also for the plumbers, painters.. that worked in them.

Lyte_theelf,MMFB,1389698516.0,"I understand how you feel. I've been there. 

You said you're not sure what's making you feel so down... It is something. Maybe even multiple somethings. Take some time by yourself, relax completely, and let it come to you. You're depressed for a reason and your mind and body are trying to tell you that.

It's always those times when ""everything"" is stressful that it's really one or a couple specific things that go deep.

For the longest time I was severely depressed and I was sure it was ""clinical depression"" and that something was wrong with the chemicals in my brain. I went to a therapist, she put me on drugs (as they do...) and while I did work through some important things, I never got over my depression.

In comes my current live-in boyfriend who is like a therapist for me. I just started talking to him about my past and he made me realize-- duh, I'm probably depressed because I have a terrible relationship with my father. It wasn't an issue I was running into every day, it wasn't like the man lived with me or was even in the picture and I didn't even think about him that often, but his absence and the way we ended things (and his death when I was 18) broke something inside of me that I had never even realized was broken-- and I called it ""being depressed for no reason."" I never needed drugs... I just needed to admit to myself that I missed my father and deal with what that meant.

It's probably that obvious thing that anyone would look at your life and go ""That's really sad"", but to you it's just something that happened, or is happening. 

Let yourself realize what it is and don't be afraid. Whatever the truth is, it's okay, and you will feel better for admitting it to yourself.

&gt; everything is so stressful, but I don't want to dwell on these problems. I dwell on them a lot and it consumes my energy.

You don't want to dwell on them, but it's all you do. So don't ""dwell""... follow them down the rabbit hole. Why do they stress you out? What is the reason behind the curtain that you aren't sharing with you?

You make a good point that Thorin's journey is brought to light more in the film, when in the book it was barely there at all: he goes from one type of arsehole to another. That's a very apt, if simple, description. Frankly, I've always felt that book Thorin is something of a substitute-antagonist of the story: since there is no clear enemy for Bilbo and the company to be facing, Bilbo faces Thorin's animosity instead. To be absolutely honest, I would like to see more of that in the film ; there's hardly any.

And the Bree intro? They need to produce a short film of it! Richard said it was two days of filming - surely there's enough material for us to see the ""Waiting For Gandalf"" mini-play? :D

Then Renly could have swooped with ample food from the Reach to save the people from the evil, incompetent Lannisters.

I find it absolutely hilarious that you are so so stupid that your complete inability to infer and comprehend a sentence and its obvious meaning which everyone else can, you think is a reflection on me.

zak75,tall,1389698967.0,"The fact that you use not fitting in a car or plane as your tall disadvantages kind of confirms my age/wealth theory. Try being painfully crushed into a school bus every day for over an hour or similarly crushed into a train seat for over two hours a day when I started working. Add in all the other physical annoyances of chairs, desks, beds, bathrooms, counters, etc. Maybe stuff like that contributed to being near crippled for a time in my twenties with arthritis of the spine. Doctors think it likely that height would be a contributing factor in my heart problems too.  
  
I wonder if younger people can imagine how hard it was to get clothes/shoes years ago and even worse how amazingly expensive it was too. Years ago it was extremely rare to find anything longer than 33"" (and those were rare enough) or over a UK11/US12 shoe in normal shops. Specialist shops weren't common and were very expensive. That's not a good combination for a family with not a lot of money. By about 11/12 I'd outgrown what was available but specialist stuff was too expensive, so my mum would do things like letting the hem down. You could always tell though and stuff never fitted great.  
  
There was one shop that had a small range of shoes that we could afford but they were still expensive and not the style someone my age would choose to wear. The cost meant I often felt guilty asking and consequently wore shoes that crushed my toes. From about 14/15 I didn't wear sport shoes/trainers again until I was an adult because there was only one shop that did my size and we couldn't afford them. Those trainers would probably be the equivalent of a PS4 now! So as a teenager my day began by getting out of a bed that didn't fit and getting into visibly ill-fitting clothes, unfashionable shoes that hurt my toes and a nice painful journey to school.   
  
I don't have great eyesight and my right eye has astigmatism, so I was meant to wear a patch on my left lens. I also have slightly crooked teeth so was meant to wear braces. I was also born with a minor hip problem that gives me a slightly unusual gait and stance. At one point I was a kid with the patch on his glasses that couldn't see great, who lisped because of his braces and who walked funny. Imagine if that's better or worse when you're twice the size of everybody else!  
  
I could go on but I can't believe how much thinking about this is almost making me want to cry, so I'll stop. All I'd ask is for people to not say that there are no real problems from being tall, as plenty of us will have experienced real problems."

Micelight,WritingPrompts,1389699019.0,"Eventually it wasn't willpower that pulled us away from the sound but sheer exhaustion as we kept getting up to bring the needle back to the start of the 'music.' Days had passed, the engineers and I completely transfixed by the music that flowed over us until hunger finally set in, and we motioned for the sounds to stop. Though no one got up to move the needle and instead tones of random noise shrilled through the air and finally put an end to our indulgence.

In stark contrast to what we had heard, this was chaotic and hurtful to us - an absolute atrocity that incited one of the younger engineers to leap up and tear the arm right off the 'phonograph,' leaving us in stunned silence.

""Who were they?""

An older member of the team postured to me and for once, in all my time as a Leader of Information, I had no answer. Though he was wiser than most, a genius of design by all accounts, and observing the minute was his life.

""You recognised the language. What I don't recognise is even more telling though. The designs do not resemble anything known to us.""

Strong wording from an engineer. Yet something in his expression made me believe him. Nevertheless...

""Why should you be so sure?""

""My father is the Leader of designs.""

That made sense. He held a similar air to his father, a council member wrought from the strongest metals whose certainty in his knowledge saw what many thought impossible to be fabricated. Of course he'd make his son knowledgeable in such things - no doubt an heir-to-be in the near future. Still, his knowledge of designs surpassed mine, and I had to agree that it was undeniable that this Voyager was a hole in my supposedly flawless logic - a new chapter in a book; not just a footnote or an archived incident report.

The signal... the device had been directing a weak signal behind it when it had been discovered. Perhaps we could ping it back to the receiver? When I voiced this thought, the heir apparent had just given me a look that practically told me to ""keep up,"" and with that he was motioning to his team to begin work on the Voyager, ignoring ""the elephant in the room"" (fantastic expression by them, it rolls so well in a sentence) regarding our days of musical coma.

I kept the disc in my possession with certainty that the chaotic sounds resembled something. Perhaps information in another format? My vision somewhat impaired by age, I would need a sensory expert to acutely report to me what the wave formations on the disc translated to. Perhaps visual cues?

Days passed before my hunch proved correct. In all, 116 images were recovered through a simple analogue coding, and for the very first time, I saw what had produced the wondrous noises. Humanity. Disregarding their terribly primitive boasts of technology, they were an impressive race through their sheer diversity. Colours along an entire scale, drastic physical deviations, nearly dichotomous cultures - they were an incredible testament to the flexibility of their biology (The main 'variety event' as we named it, seems to have been when a group of their early ancestors departed from what was known as Ethiopia, leaving behind other factions. This is in stark contrast to our own evolution where we as a species remained in the same area and shared the same genetic variations, and fanned out in a coordinated manner - like ripples in liquid). Of design in themselves, they were interesting to say the least. Bipedal, their design favoured momentum through forward inertia and left them above the ground at a height sufficient to observe their environment with their sensory organs. Eyes. They had these interesting eyes that were clearly dedicated to vision, yet unlike our own calcified lenses (of which far surpass human capabilities; and appeared only in the extinct ‘trilobite’ class on their home planet) they appeared to have some soft internal structure. An outer carapace of soft tissue (skin) formed a flexible sack for their internal organs (fascinating systems with designated functions – the heart being one in particular. Our entire circulatory system operates off a pulsing mechanism similar to how the human vein works – independent of any central pump and under negative pressure, moving liquid through constrictions of the walls and a series of valves, but I digress once again) that could regenerate itself with alarming swiftness in what was surely an evolutionary boon for the human race. Other organs such as the ear were more or less the same, as there are only so many ways in which vibrations can be translated to the ‘brain,’ and I wasn’t particularly surprised to see many features of our compatriot Directorate species mirrored in non-human fauna, such as gills and outer layers facilitating cutaneous gas exchange. The wealth of medical knowledge endowed to me in a few images segeued into their own prized designs – and then ended altogether


Whilst I was close to unprofessional levels of exultation at seeing the music makers, the absence of any military might was of the most interest to me – they seemed to completely ignore the concept of combat. What could be made of that? Divergence *always* ignited conflict. Whole planets in our colony systems lay beneath clouds of radioactive fury as a permanent testament to this, trillions of lives exterminated throughout the history of our existence for reasons that defied logical reasoning.

No. Surely they had wars. The absence of such demonstrations was one of peace. An invitation supplemented by star system maps and inscriptions detailing a relative location in the midst of 14 pulsar stars. A “return to sender” address. I informed the council. They listened to my voice of reason alone, the record kept absent from discussions, yet the Leader of Designs looked through my guise of objective reasoning the entire time – a cold, measuring stare that told me all I needed to know. He wished to design sounds of control himself, an obstacle I would counter later.

With the trace permit granted I had returned to the Voyager research facility when the engineers finally completed the preparations for a “phone home.” The internals of the device were diagnostic tools mainly, powered by a weak radioisotope cell that had somehow managed to slightly reverse the decay process and effectively recharge (perhaps a local neutron storm or solar emission laden with Proton-2 was to thank?) itself. The transmitter was boosted by our Giga Station - several ore dense planets turned into a supermassive signal array spanning an entire solar system – and we literally were waiting on the countdown, tinkering in front of the harnessed Voyager  when we heard several loud clicks fire off before we had any idea what was happening.

A ‘camera’ had just imaged 13 completely foreign creatures standing in front of a captured probe holding equipment (which upon retrospect, strongly resembled human firearms) and had 'hijacked' (in reality, it was already wired and ready to send a 'nonsense' signal that could be traced) the Giga Station array to send them off to an area of designated dead space. Panic ensued. They would wake to a console in their command centre depicting a team of alien organisms bearing down on a probe which proudly had a home address on it. A diplomatic disaster? Most certainly. Something that could render us unable to ever learn the secrets of the wonderful sounds. We had to give chase.

162.5 is just over 11 and a half stone, right? You're right in the middle of your BMI range.

silverionmox,changemyview,1389699243.0,"&gt; The EU is stupidly bureaucratic. Point in question: The European Parliament has been switching between Strasbourg and Brussels for twenty years at a cost of 150 million euros a year. It practically a parody of government. You'd think they'd be able to fix this sometime in the last two decades but alas. 

The only reason they didn't is because individual states can veto it. In this case, France blocks it. The parliament itself has had a huge majority for decades to cut the travelling circus.

&gt;Free trade already exists without the European union. There is no need for a political union for this. 

Free trade &lt;&gt; free enterprise. The EU guarantees the latter. In addition, it has also been able to set standards, and by being so big those standards become practically the de facto world standards.

&gt;The Euro handicaps the poorer regions of the Eurozone as they cannot lower their currency value, so they struggle to compete and export.

That's an argument against every currency ever. At least they finally are out of the periodical devaluation trap. I do think the Euro should be a bit cheaper, but that's a disagreement about the policy of the ECB, not the usefulness of the Euro itself.

&gt;International relations. Let's take the UK and Spain. Very different views on things like Gibraltar and the Falklands. It would be very difficult to get a European consensus on these positions. 

I don't see why ""difficult to achieve"" would also mean ""undesireable to achieve""?

&gt;One Europe military would suffer the same as above. Let's take Libya. France and UK want in, but the rest aren't as keen. Do the troops get sent? Another is say France and UK didn't want war. You can bet they'd still be providing the bulk of the military, and having to watch British and Frenchmen die for a conflict domestically unpopular.

Let's not put the cart before the horse. Obviously a EU *defense* force would be constructed first, and we'll see to which extent the expeditionary forces can be integrated later. Even if some countries keep their armies as they do now (mostly the UK and France, let's be frank), then it's still worthwhile if only to put the 3/4 of Europe's soldiers that are now fragmented into ineffectual toy armies to better use."

Redditors hardly represent the western world at large. I've noticed Askmenions are pretty conservative about sex, and they tend to be younger.

Because yes, divorce in many states really does ruin a man (been there, done that.)

A good way to gauge this is to ask men and women exactly what will make them notice someone in a crowded room. Guys will of course talk about looks and body. At most, they'll mention swagger or posture. Women, however, will lean more toward noticing men who appear hygienic, assertive and sure of themselves. Or how much fun they appear to be having. These qualities don't manifest in a man's looks as much as they do in the way he talks and what kind of people he's surrounded with. Dress is of course also a factor but I don't think that's exclusive to either gender."

wolfkin,boardgames,1389699708.0,"&gt;For some games it's important to get the feel of all the stages of it. 

that is just flat out true. Which is why I do love WIP but the very idea of that I think wouldn't occur to the fresh nubile gamer. It only occurred to me because I think things through. I generally have well managed expectations.

I saw Wii Sports as a fun but ultimately shallowish game and as a result in year 2 or 3 when everyone else literally flipped from loving it as the best game they'd ever played to it being the most boring thing the Wii had to offer I still maintained my muted affection for the game. And btw that was the most startling flip I think I've ever seen. For as completely bonkers as people were going for WiiSports I'm still sorta amazed and how crazy and hard everyone flipped on it.

My most shocked flipped was Uncharted 1. The entire industry used to go on and on and on about how revolutionary the game was and how they couldn't even really [explain why](http://xkcd.com/566/) and I'm lazy to really study the footage. SO when I finally got the game. I started it and after 40 minutes i was supremely disappointed. It was basically Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time plus guns. However once I reduced my expectations the game it was ended up being thoroughly enjoyable. Not Sands of Time enjoyable but honestly I never expect a game without Metroid Prime or Link to the Past in it's name to surpass Sands of Time. Which is why I was shocked when Ocarina of Time did it. ( i played that late)

Starlit is great they basically do in words (and pretty well) what Tabletop does. They explain why the game is fun. Plus they're pretty good about showing you what the game will look like. Their pro is doing all of that in under 10 minutes. I think they're the best short form show in that regard. DiceTower is more popular and it's useful to the not new gamer but for a new gamer Starlit is more friendly."

We stood there hopelessly waving our arms as the bus sped right past us and up the hill to its usual weekday bus stop. The one it wasn't meant to stop at on Sundays.

Then again i feel like how others feel it is hypocritical, only caring about the deaths of someone in their own country/part of the world while a terrible thing across the world barely register for them. The fact that 9/11 seems to be treated, still, like it's worse than the war that followed because it took the lives of westerners not 'foreigners' is the best example. I'm not trying to bash anyone that might have lost someone, for you it really is worse as you personally knew the ones that died, , but how the media/government changed the world and still milks this is just insane. There is also when a accident happens abroad, the new will go out of it's way to mention how many from our country that was in the accident or get a interview with someone from our country instead of someone that actually know something about the situation. Don't get me wrong, i think all stories are horrible and i feel a 'fuck that' feeling that make me feel bad for a while but no actual sadness

I do however feel something when i'm in direct contact with someone, near them, or if they are close to me.

silverionmox,changemyview,1389700123.0,"I think that religion should *never* be a reason to get around a general prescription. Adhering to a religion is a choice, after all. In particular, an employer can demand a certain dressing style from its employees - if they refuse, for any reason, they just can't work there.

For the same reason I'm also against banning them explicitly, because individual clothing choices are just that: individual clothing choices. Still, if eg. a local government has experienced trouble with religious symbols in the past, this can be a way to prevent these problems, and one that is perfectly within their purview as an employer."

Idiot American doctors tend to think in 1 dimension: i.e. you can have one and only one illness at a time. And if a patient claims their meds are not working, they think you're just making it up and dismiss you. They do not tend to use evidence-based medicine. It was unbelievably hard to present evidence from reliable sources (like NIH, peer reviewed journals, etc) to convince a doctor to run more tests. 
And going to a new doctor would mean starting the process all over again, wasting more time. 
American ER doctors are great, family doctors, not so much.

Lost_Afropick,AskReddit,1389700278.0,"Market forces.  Sports stars are paid highly because people are willing to pay to see them.  So long as they can deliver a sold out gate they deserve to be paid from that gate.  It's a choice.  If you don't believe they should be paid, then don't go to watch them, don't buy from their sponsors and don't buy their merchandise.  It's that simple.  They don't take money from people who aren't prepared to pay for them.  So if you aren't interested in sport, you aren't paying for it*.

There are vastly more doctors than there are elite high paid sports stars.  So very many more.  Too pay doctors what elite sportsmen get would mean that nobody would be able to afford a doctor.  If doctors were as rare as Kobes, Vetels and Ronaldos then they probably would be that highly paid.  (We'd also all be sick and live a lot shorter too).  Doctors supply a service.

already we have ascertained it isn't sexual assault its sexual assault and violence (a very significant difference).

you might be interested to know having critiqued other similar past studies the definition of ""Violence "" was ""anyone who has made contact to you anyway that you rather they didn't"" (or something to that effect) which included siblings and parents etc from their entire life.

Anyone with genuine statistical experience of composing their own studies and reports on these issues will tell you how worthless and misrepresented they are.

You would be absolutely shocked at how piss poor and misleading most statistical studies are, they are not even fit for purpose, because often they either serve an agenda or are part of an initiative from a politician or think tank.

this isn't tin foil hat wearing nonsense, get anyone with professional objective experience from say the national statistics office or the royal statistics society and they will tell you how appalling and down right misleading these kinds of reports are.

We got the local bakery to donate the bread from the previous day (they normally just throw it out) and just asked people to donate spreads (jam, vegemite, etc) after a few weeks it caught on, people would donate cereal and orange juice."

But also about history and other subjects you consider boring.  I get very frustrated talking to adults who seem to have no concept of history.  It lets them say things like these are the end times and things have never been so bad and foolishness of that nature.  So what you may think... these people go on to dictate policy and make the same old mistakes our ancestors have over and over.

You need an understanding of science, history and other things to understand the world around you as an adult.  Decisions you will make rely on your understanding.

You need to understand if not the complex science itself, at least the scientific process and methodology.  How it works.  So that you can be an adult and read a newspaper headline, glance over the so called study and look at the methodology yourself.  So that you can understand the back and forth arguments.  Why?  Because you may be voting about such things that affect all of us at an election perhaps.  Climate denial, abortion, robot rights who knows..."

gravvs,changemyview,1389700886.0,"Okay I pretty much agree with you. There are a few things I need to clarify. 

The social skills I'm talking about encompass a wide range of things. It's about charisma in general—not just with people one's interested in sexually/romantically. It's about becoming an interesting and confident person. It's about personal magnetism. All the things that make someone an appealing person. The kind of person everyone likes being around. 

When you start off as a chubby quiet kid who only plays video games and watches anime then you've got a lot of work to do. There's no one out there telling you how to act. You have to learn how to do everything yourself. In no way do I think it's male specific. Plenty of awkward chicks in the world who have to go through the same processes. 

As for the whole rejection thing I think women and men generally face the same amount of rejection—just in different ways (or better put we all face the same kinds of rejection—just in different amounts for different kinds). It all levels out though. 

Men are generally expected to be the initiator. It's a negative result of patriarchy but it's where we are. Fortunately it's changing (anecdotally most girls I end up with are initiators). But learning how to ask someone on a date without coming across as creepy or awkward or nervous is a learned skill. It takes practice. For both men and women. Men are just the ones who are 'supposed' to learn it. 

 You say that it only takes a lot of rejection to learn how to approach someone
&gt;Only if your goal is to bang them.

Yes and no. Only wanting to bang is a little reductive. It takes practice learning how to ask someone for something more than a friendship. Yes this probably means that one intent is sexual. But that isn't necessarily the only intent. Sometimes it is, but most of the time it's only part of a larger romantic interest. A lot of time men just pursue friendship because they're afraid of rejection and actually want a relationship. Then they misogynistically blame the friendzone even though they pursued friendship. Learning how to accept rejection in a healthy way is a hard thing to learn (for both men and women).

No one teaches you any of this. It's just something you have to try figure out. No one teaches charisma. No one teaches confidence. Redpill is seductive because it gives you a set of rules. It teaches you how to act. It gives you a process to go through. I think it's a poisonous philosophy because it mixes useful advice with misogyny and at times racism. "

bubbish,AskMen,1389701197.0,"Let's get a little more hypothetical here. Do you think maybe it's subtly tied to mindset? This example might appear unrelated but bear with me;

After my first year of college, I spent a summer working a desk job. It was boring work but I really wanted the money. I was paid per hour and I had nothing better to that summer so I really went for it. I got up every morning and was like ""let's really work today! Many hours! Lots of money!"". I was killing it every day for 3 months. When school started back up, I kept working evenings because that was the original format of the job even before that summer. However, I completely lost any drive to work any more than the agreed minimum (8 hours per week) and my productivity plummeted. I could still use every extra thousand as a student but I was just so sick of that office and those tasks.

I thought I got tired because I had worked many hours but that didn't make any sense. I wasn't physically tired, and I wasn't even sick of the intrinsic properties of those tasks because it was IT and that's still very much my forte. So I came to the conclusion that I was sick of the job because of my attitude. I got tired from pushing myself to earn money. I didn't hit any goal, I just wanted as much as possible.

Apologies for the long example but do you think I'm on to something here? What if you go into casual sex with a different mindset? Could you possibly prevent bad habits or negatively affected opinions if you focus on finding a healthy *""why""* of casual sex, just as I could probably have prevented my work problem if I had worked hard for a different reason?"

However, I'm pretty sure that ""fucking around"" is the right thing to do for &gt; 90% of the people who just started to get into fitness and did so to get into shape.

You do realize that subtitles are a form of translation. I dislike Subtitles. I can't speak the Langauge, so the natural cadence of Japanese doesn't assist me in understanding, it just sounds like distracting gibberish, distracting me from the words that are getting placed in front of the hand drawn images or well-placed cinematography.

Even watching good old films, like 8 and 1/2 was challenging as a sub, it's a race to read the text as soon as it appears because I have no idea when it will disappear. I either miss stuff that's on the screen or stuff being said. I'd be a terrible deaf person, I guess.

Dubs, especially now that the anime community has become profitable, can be rather decent. It's hard to not be excited when a company like Funimation and Mangavision announce that they're setting up a dub."

azoenophile,AskWomen,1389702016.0,"Singleton here. 

My partner of seven years broke up with me three days before Christmas because of a fight gone wrong. He thought I had said I was not attracted to him because of a comment I made (which had nothing to do with my level of attraction). He has really low body-image which he blames on me and our past sex life, so he ended things, saying he doesn't feel like I find him attractive. [that couldn't be further from the truth and I firmly believe that, while I will find a man much better for me in many ways, I will probably not end up with anyone more attractive than my ex. He's a fucking babe.] Clearly there were a lot of communication issues. I firmly believe the vast majority of our problems would've been solved had we moved back in together (his brother and family of five moved in a year and a half ago. I can't stand them, so I live alone), he agrees and our counselor agrees. However, he says there's just too much baggage to work through. I feel like I put the vast majority of the effort into that relationship, so I'm not going to sit here pining if he isn't willing to put forth small effort to fix things easily. We have amazing chemistry and it's always felt *right*, from day one, but I can't change his unrealistic expectations for relationships and I can't handle his complete inability to communicate like an adult. 

Started sleeping with an old friend who is in the process of divorce. He's been hung up on an old flame so it's been perfect to make dinner, drink wine, talk about relationship problems, and then bang it out. He's an incredibly generous lover and we fit well together. His old flame finally decided to try and make it work a few days ago, so my good sex is gone now, too. 

I'm not totally emotionally available at this point, though I've had plenty of people express interest in something in the future. I want to find someone attractive who enjoys similar things, who I can bang and have a good time with. Then I realize that has always been my ex and I get mad all over again. "

My thesis project is/was illustrating and re-designing book covers. Even if they aren't published, there is still a workflow and problem-solving process that happens. But perhaps that is easier than some other projects because if the book is well known, like mine are, then an art director can also see how you might have arrived at that final product and know what considerations you might have made to get there. (Because the client is ultimately the reader, even though the publisher is the one paying you).

I know the above poster said not to make fake work, but if you haven't found much beyond someone needing a CD cover or a band poster, then I think if well-executed, this is better than just student work.

bubbish,AskMen,1389702167.0,"&gt; I look at a girl I would have a one night stand with from a very different perspective than I do a girl I would be in a relationship with. I think most people do this? We want more from a person we are going to be in a relationship with?

You're right but I also think you're missing a key point - humans are masters of projection and as such we easily overlook those facets of a person which seem irrelevant to whatever purpose we have in mind with a hookup. In more specific terms, you might view a one night stand in a way which disregards her person as a whole. You know as well as I do that many strong relationships start out as hookups with no long-term intention from either side. This means that while we might look for certain qualities in a girl from the beginning, we mustn't forget that other qualities will make themselves visible with time and those might be more relevant to long-term partnership. I think it takes quite a strong and one-dimensional mindset to miss this aspect of a hookup entirely."

there is no value or point to me in trying to convince a single stranger to change their view, it makes no real world difference to me (genuinely).

but i do care about good information or someone making me aware of something i have overlooked or misunderstood or gotten wrong.

by being direct and emotionally unsympathetic, I can quickly and efficiently find out who is objective principle led and who is emotionally driven.

I don't care if someone is rude to me or direct to me or unforgiving provided that what they add by way of insight or information has value.

in its simplest way: knowing how you as an individual ""feel"" on an issue, is useless, but knowing information and logically objective perspective or information is not.

Whys should anyone care what ""person X"" feels on subject Y, they are 1 person in a sea of billions, unless the insight they bring measures up to the yardstick of objective logical merit, it genuinely has no value to me, you might as well be telling me about your favourite foods.

FreedomCow,AskWomen,1389702756.0,"This is an amusing but sad story from the halls of OkCupid. I had tried the website twice for meeting people, having deleted my account the first time and started anew a year later when I felt like using it again. This story is about the same dude in both instances.

First OKC: 

as usual, I'm a lady on a site loaded with guys and I am a bit overwhelmed by how many messages I received. One guy messaged me and seemed nice enough, looked cute in his photos, and his Q&amp;As weren't objectionable. As I start typing a reply, I get another message from him. No big deal, I figured he remembered something he forgot to add in his first message, something I do occasionally as well.

But then he sends me a third message. And then a fourth. He is actually starting to panic over my lack of a reply. He saw that I had looked at his profile and still hadn't responded to his contact, so *clearly* I was judging him for something and deeming him unworthy and he must frantically explain things away before I've even had a chance to accuse him of anything (which I wasn't going to do). It was the most absurdly desperate-looking thing I'd ever seen, and when message #3 came in I decided I wasn't going to answer him. 

Well, except for when he sent me message #5, saying he realized I was probably not going to respond at this point because he overdid it, and sorry and good-bye. At this point I chose to reply and say, ""Yeah, that was odd, good-luck in your search,"" figuring that would be it and he'd stop trying to talk to me.

And then he sends me two more messages about...whatever it was. More desperation in text format.

Second OKC:

I start up a brand-new account, and I get a message from this...dude. Who looks a bit familiar. And whose name seems familiar. And writing reads familiar. I look at his pictures and recognize some and HOLY SHIT IT'S DESPERATE-O. I actually reply to remind him about our previous interaction and asked him not to contact me further, to which he replied by calling me a Cunt. :( nooo

in all seriousness, I hope that guy gets his shit in order and stops behaving like that. I can't imagine how weird he must be in person.

---

I actually have one more. Another guy from OKC. I contacted him first but didn't get a reply for a long time because he rarely logged in; his response came right before I was about to delete my account, so I asked him to add me on Facebook so we could get to know each other. He seemed...alright, and I figured I should meet the guy and see what he's like. He invites me to some little music show next to a coffee shop, which was fun and different, and I got to meet his roommates who were really cool - but if they were not present, I probably would have been turned off from him rather fast, or at least said no to a second date. He did invite me to a house party after and I figured, ""Why not,"" and said I'd go.

MISTAKE. MISTAAAAAAAAAAAKE. I will say I'm a pretty fun chick and I can see why he was interested in me (especially since he told me he didn't actually talk to any other girl on that site the entire time he used it), but WHY was he suddenly so attached to me and desperate for my approval? He and his roommates put on a music show in their garage, which he played the drums for, which was cool. *Immediately* after they finished, he came up to me and actually felt the need to defend himself and say that he normally plays much better than that, he just made a few mistakes that's all!!!

Even better: I went to the bathroom for 5 minutes 'cause...I had to go to the bathroom. I come out and he finds me immediately and says, with sincere relief, ""There you are, I couldn't find you! I thought you just up and left!"" This may have been before the drums thing actually, I recall that because I was found that REALLY weird. Why would he think I'd just fucking ditch his party without saying good-bye? What reason would I have to do that?

 He wasn't *too* bad most of the time but I was uncomfortable anyway, and kind of tried to escape him and had to make up an excuse about getting up for work early the next day so I could just leave. I felt a little awful when he contacted me on FB a week or two later asking me if I wanted to get lunch with him (he had already tried to invite me to another party, and I had turned that down) and I had to work up the nerve to say I wasn't interested in seeing him again."

Scarlet-Ladder,TumblrInAction,1389703564.0,"I really hope this is a joke, but I'm going to treat it as if it isn't because I want to have a bit of a rant.

SJWs seem to want everything to be really obvious - the film can have no subtleties. For example, the writers have explained that Kristoff is Sami, but Tumblrites can't stop moaning about the fact that he doesn't explicitly say it, despite it not having any relevance to the plot at all for him to do so.

Also - how does this SJW /know/ that all of the characters are cis? I mean, they probably are (let's be honest), but it feels like the SJWs have a view of what trans people 'should' look like. As far as I know, Kristoff never got his bio-dick out on screen, so how do we know he's not trans? We don't. What they mean is 'he isn't what I think trans men /should/ look like: read, small and weak and female-looking'. 

I mean I'm just hypothesising here. But it seems like SJWs feel the need to be able to put people into tiny little boxes all the time, saying 'you should look like this because you're such-and-such'.

I don't even know why I'm typing this. I shouldn't put this much thought into a kids' movie."

If both of you consent (preferably in a way the law acknowledges) and are fully informed as to what's going to be happening (no pulling out your whips in the spur of the moment), then sex is just that: sex. Lots of people go out to bars/clubs and go home with a stranger who they don't know anything about; you could find out they had been 15 the week afterward and it wouldn't change the quality of the sex that occurred. 

As a lot of people have pointed out, the relative power thing is important to keep in mind as well as where you are in your life. If she's about to graduate and want's to see the world and try new things, dating someone who's nearing the age for settling down isn't the best option.

I also consider a 4-bet in this spot the same as a 3-bet while in position.

It would be much, much different if we opened from an earlier position and were 3-bet from the big blind, but because we're opening from the c/o we have to consider that our opponent is ranging us for having a hand like the one we're actually holding - and it would be a mistake to play our hand the exact same way we would if our opponent could see what we had.

A competent player could be 3-betting from the big blind with all kinds of hands in this spot, and I'm not going to let *him* take advantage of the fact that neither if us have any reads.

So if I have a hand that is good enough to 3-bet an OOP open raise, I'll 4-bet with it for the exact same reasons while *in* position (assuming that we're not being 3-bet after raising from an early position)."

ballepung,AskMen,1389704026.0,"Most definitely. That's arguably one of the reasons for why the human race has grown so rapidly. A man's ability to get a boner even from seeing a fairly average or ugly girl naked, is of key importance to genes being spread. A woman doesn't need to be wet to have sex(though it's obviously to be prefered). But a man needs to be hard. Had men been as hard to turn on as women, then we would obviously not have grown in number as fast as we have done.

It is common knowledge that women are generally more picky about choosing who they want to have kids with. Especially modern women, who are ""free"" from old-fashioned scrutiny and therefore allowed to follow their natural instincts.

The selection process has always consisted of men fighting for women, and women being the chooser. It's not just based on the structure of society. Biology plays an important part in this, and it will continue to do so.

Seeing as women actually *needed* men before, they naturally had to lower their standards. This society structure was obviously there not only for economical or religious reasons, but because it benefitted the common man who'd have a really hard time finding a partner in a free society.

If we compare the Western world in the 50's and the Western world today, then we see that things have turned upside down for the common man. It is now much easier to get casual sex, but also much harder to find someone to settle down with. The rate of childless and unmarried men seems to increase day by day, and that's not just because the rate of people not wanting marriage/kids are increasing. It's because women are allowed(hell, even *encouraged* to) to have lower standards when it comes to casual sex, and higher standards when it comes to settling down. As a result, we have a lot of frustrated lonely men AND women. The men don't understand what they are doing wrong, and the women don't understand why they can't get a ""good"" man.

It's a massive paradox, really. A world where women don't need men, is a harsh world where only the lucky will find a soulmate and have kids. But a world where women need men, is a sexist and unfair world. We obviously don't want *that*.

For all parts to be happy, we need to magically convince women from birth that they don't need men, but it's sure nice to have them. We need to magically convince them that a man doesn't need to stand out to be attractive. But is this really possible, seen from a biological point of view? Wouldn't that be like telling guys not to get a boner from wide hips and firm boobs?

codayus,AskMen,1389704211.0,"&gt; If make up and airbrushing were banned, models like Kate Moss and Tyra Banks, plus singers like Katy Perry would not have been signed

Really?

&gt; because they don't look good enough naturally without make up,

...really?

&gt;  they would therefore be replaced with women who do look better without make up, such as the American Apparel models.

Um...

&gt; This would in turn make women have an even worse negative body image, as the models would be changed to ones more beautiful than the previous ones

Why are you asking questions if you already know all the answers?  (Also, that doesn't even make sense.  What are people like, eg, Kate Moss selected on if not looks?)

&gt; So why do women think it's a good thing to get rid of airbrushing in advertising and magazines?

Because they disagree with your conclusions, obviously.  See also:  Why do people keep voting for [Democrats/Republicans] when its clear their policies will destroy the very fabric of American culture?  Also, why do they keep buying [Coke/Pepsi] despite the fact that [Pepsi/Coke] tastes so much better?"

FlagVC,MillerPlanetside,1389704235.0,"Where to start...

Ravens overlap with AV mana turrets, only they're more dangerous(while it does cost resources to pull a max).

I always found ZOE to have a bigger bark than bite(after the first set of nerfs), though I know a lot of people don't agree with me. So be it. But yes, it does overlap somewhat with charge.

For the NC MAX, it is and has always been -WAY- too front loaded. And as long as this stays the case, the MAXes won't ever reach a state that can be called balanced. The difference may be a ""meager"" 0.3 seconds, but when you're starting at 0.5 seconds or so for TR and VS maxes, an improvement of 0.3 is actually an insane edge. In short, however, the NC MAX guns are flawed by design in more ways than one.

Striker: Now that one should never have been a lock-on. Remove that part and it can be balanced appropriately. In case people want to know how this would work out, make it a 5-shot fracture and adjust damage accordingly. No lock-on, very low indirect damage, relatively high velocity and BOOM !! About as balanced as the striker could ever be. Because fuck lock-ons.

And then there's the Vanguard. Starts out as the worst one stock, but also peaks much better than both the Prowler and Magrider, giving the great NC tankers a massive gap in power* where there really shouldn't be.

*AV power, I know the VG lacks somewhat in the AI department. But just to beat people to the punch, the VG HE gun is not the decidedly worst one. That's a fabricated lie, as it's identical in all ways to the mag gun, except it hits harder on vehicles and enjoys the swivel-motion of a turret."

If you manually cast the orb ability (not autocast), then it will count as a spell and not draw tower aggro so the tower will continue to beat on your creeps,  not you.  If it's set to autocast, it'll count as a regular attack and draw tower aggro.

Never too late.

&gt; i use ""185/65R14 86T"" tires or will i have to go up in ratio to 70?

I'd go with 70 or 75. 70 will be just a little smaller than OEM (1.11%), 75 would be a little larger (1.87%). Either one is close enough to be acceptable. You can play with sizes here: http://www.1010tires.com/Tools/Tire-Size-Calculator/

&gt; How would the ratio (higher/lower) effect my performace or safety?

Too large could give you wheel well clearance problems, reduce braking force and engine power, and throw off your speedometer and odometer. Too small could give you ground clearance problems, reduce highway fuel economy (it's like taller gearing), and also mess with your speedometer/odometer. But 2% in either direction isn't too small/large; not at all.

&gt; Also do winter rims require special lug nuts?

Not as a rule, but there are a few different lug nut seat types. http://www.f150online.com/forums/members/kingfish51-albums-truck-pics-picture266-lug-nut-types.jpg If your winter and OEM rims are different, you could possibly need different lugs for them.

Those that fall into it are not the same as a 'naturally thin' person, and they don't tend to have a healthy relationship with food...of any sort.

However, I've never seen someone 'pressured' to be overweight. It usually happens when the person deems other aspects of their lives (job, family, etc..) as more important than really watching their bodies, or some sort of medical thing, (hormones, surgeries, sickness, etc) where they are 'seemingly' suddenly buying bigger sized clothes and wondering how they got where they are. Sometimes they don't have a healthy relationship with food...sometimes they don't have a relationship with healthy foods...sometimes other things come into play, (mental crap like with anorexia) 

so, I guess what I'm saying is that...Anorexia comes from 'caring too much about what others think.' Where the fat-acceptance is a part of the 'don't worry about what other's think, and just live'

Both groups can benefit from 'acceptance'. As in, learning to love your body for what it can do...and not necessarily how it looks. Which is a more 'healthy' way to see anyone. Shaming for either shouldn't happen."

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1389704801.0,"It's normal to be conflicted.  Society us tells over and over that we should love and respect our parents.  It's hard to overcome decades of conditioning like that.  Society also tells our parents should love and respect their children.  Obviously our parents 'forgot' their part of the equation and they also obviously don't care in the least.  

&gt; But on the other hand I have no support at all. 
Actually, you don't have any support now.  Your father proved that by not 'caring' about your upcoming graduation and I'm sure there are other examples you haven't told us about yet.  

One lesson I've learned over the years is that no family is better than a bad family.  It's a hard lesson to learn and it took me (literally) decades to learn this.  I tried to be a 'mediator' between family members and just ended up making myself miserable.  Once I stopped 'mediating' I started feeling much better about life and myself.

Stay NC for awhile and try LC later in life if you still feel conflicted.  I think you'll find NC is the way to go as Ns never change (IMHO).  

Congrats on your upcoming graduation and don't stress missing the ceremony to much if you can't go.  I didn't even think about going to mine as I didn't want to go through the hassle of trying to get my family there without killing each other.

Buzzword33,Hamilton,1389704900.0,"I didn't know which response between you two to reply to, but since this one comment seems to spark the majority of the comments, I will put it here:

Technically, it isn't a by-law. It is written specifically into the deeds of the property that you will clear the sidewalk in front of your property or face the fine for having it done for you. Upon signing and accepting the deed agreement for the property, means that you understand that it was a duty, and you accept it.

Also, for the question about a pipe bursting on private property, it is the city's responsibility to fix it. Under access easements (both the city &amp; utility[which includes both hydro and telecoms/cable]) can go onto your property to perform maintenance to their equipment. They have to keep it maintained and up to order (of course, sometimes this can be subjected to available manpower or the quality of service being provided by the companies).

The snow-clearing from sidewalks is just common sense. There is not enough manpower and equipment to clear every road and sidewalk in the city. Also, doing it alleviates you from being sued because of negligence to clear a safe walkway in front of your property.

Now, people either not being courteous enough to clear the snow from their property either to due laziness or physically incapable of it, should pay someone to do it, whether it be a private company, or that kid carrying the shovel down the street looking to make a quick buck."

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1389705362.0,"&gt; I cannot recall the author, but a while ago I came across a book that talked about regrets and how you should try to work out your issues with people you have been in conflict with before anyone passes away and you are left in a state of regret for the rest of your life.

While this advice might work for 'normal' people I feel it's a waste of time when applied to N-people.  N's, IMHO, NEVER change, they just find different ways to manipulate people, especially their 'loved' ones.  My ex-wife tried for the entire 4 years of our marriage to get me to make up with my ndad telling me basically what this author is saying.  She refused to understand the issues between me and him, actually all 4 of his kids and him.  Well, he died in 2000 and I couldn't have cared less.  Any 'regrets' I have is that I didn't have a normal set of parents, but I realize that the idiots that conceived me and my siblings were never going to be those kind of parents.

My mantra these days, and I've repeated it in several other threads here, is: no family is better than bad family.

Micelight,WritingPrompts,1389705648.0,"Before I go further, allow me to voice the reasoning behind the 'dead' space designation. As far as we knew, no organisms were able to resist strong electron exchange reactions with gaseous 'chalcogens' due to their extreme releases of energy. Oxygen is one element that is extremely good at accepting such 'donated' electrons, and indeed can be seen at work in the fires that continue to burn on planets hit by Oxygen Warheads, hundreds of years after the last man burned. As such, the supposedly unharnessed nature of Oxygen was accepted by our biology and we evolved as chemotrophs of lower energy oxidation reactions, endowing us with slower metabolisms and enviable longevity. Many organisms did indeed 'breathe' in a sense, but they were mainly consigned to methane or gaseous Hydrogen Chloride.


Hence when spectrographs of the 'dead' area revealed extremely high proportions of gaseous oxygen we thought that no such life beyond single cell extremophiles could survive. It stood with strong precedent, but as we now know, rules are made to be broken.


Our pursuit ship was made ready and with our FTL engaged we were able to bunny hop just in front of the signal, check that it was indeed still there, and continue onto the next projected way point. We left the well mapped areas of home and turned to simple surveyor maps; more and more, the signal of home became weaker and weaker until gradually the 12 engineers and I decided to turn off communication altogether and let our computer systems project the course of the 'phone home' signal.


It wasn't long after when we started encountering alien designs along with the eerily familiar hollow planets. Gutted and stripped, whole systems were effectively destroyed. Though in stark comparison to the designs seen in my youth, the equipment here was incredibly advanced. Planet crackers of extreme proportion lay derelict and scrapped in decaying orbit around their magnum opus. Harnessing fusion itself, some had turned gas planets into short lived stars that had had an artificially induced nova that spewed precious metals into what one could only assume would have been an enormous collection apparatus of unimaginable size.
Such technology stood in stark contrast to the pitiful Voyager we had picked up as a god may view his most lowly creation. This mission had very quickly turned from one of hasty diplomacy to that of an archaeology expedition. How long was the time period between the creation of the voyager and of these behemoths? For us the progression had taken millions of rotations - and in some respects we hadn't even surpassed them yet; could it be that Voyager was so old that what we were seeing now was humanity at present? If so, where were they? Out of the few inscriptions on the ships we could find, one bore a date proudly on it's hull: ""Commissioned 9231 CE."" We had one point, but like with any equation, we need to know 2 in order to figure out it's nature (the rate at which humanity advanced itself, and whether it was a linear progression or exponential). Voyager would be that second point; we just needed to find the rotation when it was first launched


We traveled farther and farther into the zone, seeing more and more systems *destroyed* by the touch of humanity. One in particular bore our first glimpse of their weaponry; and it terrified us. Ships the size of micro planets lay dead between the planets, their hulls several ""metres"" (as measured by the calibration circle of the voyager record) of solid Iron-titanium alloy torn open as if they were the thinnest membrane. Wreckage was strewn for millions of ""kilometres"" in every direction, inter weaved with shards of a planet (as identified by an engineer who had taken studies of geology and planet formation in maturation) presumable blown to pieces by a bomb of unholy energies. It was there we found our first specimen of a human, perfectly preserved in his life-suit and floating in the cold of space. When we went to take the helmet off post retrieval one of the hoses connected to a gas tank burst free and sprayed pure oxygen into the cabin, causing us to reel back as we inhaled the toxic element unprotected. We had been desperate and disorientated, and as we lay there choking one of the engineers farthest away began the vent process without warning, flushing out our atmosphere.

We lost 2 people. The entire time, that damned corpse just lay there looking upwards. Oxygen, humanity's life force was oxygen. They had harnessed one of the most insidious electron exchange reactions - a biological impossibility.


We jettisoned the body and made haste away from the wreck, science be damned.


As we progressed further towards the signal's 'home' the technology, strangely, became inferior. The terror of the colossi we had seen earlier ebbed into indifference as the ships became more shoddy and primitive. Though a trend began to occur. Colonies emerged on new planets, albeit  all abandoned (and in one case, dead from what later turned out to be a pandemic that had moved so quickly only one broadcast made it back to Earth) and stripped of resources. the question was still nagging us all. How old were these ruins? And where were *all* the humans, for surely an extinction would yield more bodies. Unfortunately, an oxygen rich environment destroyed evidence at a rate unfamiliar with us, so forensic investigations brought up null results.


We traveled. We bunny hopped to every location; and every location confirmed we were on track as the signal passed through. Still no sign of living organisms until about 100 rotations into our expedition, when our communications (that had been turned back on to idle scanning after our first encounter with human technology) array exploded to life. A wave of radio transmissions came through; some in audio, some as text, the latter of which I translated with haste. We had life, and a new course to follow. A tiny, oxygen rich planet hailed our craft as we approached, recognising us as alien but greeting us all the same. It was a breakthrough! An extreme feeling of happiness, pleasure and awe as we landed (amongst a graveyard of nonfunctional ships) in a decrepit facility. Humans! They moved as I had predicted, and though their language was incomprehensible to us in tongues, I was able to communicate via text with them and come to an understanding of their status.


Their facility was dead. It had been for hundreds of rotations. Systems had gone offline after an internal conflict had rendered saboteurs unto the main power and sustenance stations, resulting in mass die offs.What had been hundreds of millions was reduced to thousands, scavenging technology and using biologically derived fuels to power what few faculties they had left. Vegetative growths adorned most buildings as far as the eye could see, and those who were communicating with us were admittedly guarded as they approached the first newcomers in generations. Dead, this outpost was a shell of humanity, and they knew it. They no doubt assumed we were here to usurp them. But then someone asked about the organised noises, a junior engineer I believe, and the human gave me an expression of confusion. I went out on a limb, and using a word garnered from a single broadcast following a heavily distorted transmission of organised pitches, I handed back to him his notepad:


""Music. How did you create it.""


He looked at us for a moment,, flashed his teeth as his mouth formed an upturned crescent, and wrote back:


""Figures. You bastards looked miserable the moment you stepped off your shiny ship in your big life suits.""


Interesting. Was it really that trivial? Apparently so. His dismissal of such a powerful experience angered some of the crew, and it was only through rapid communications with the man did we ascertain that almost all humans had the capabilities to produce music. As if to prove his point one of his juniors retrieved for him an oddly shaped device with taut strings (a guitar as we came to know it as) and struck a few notes in quick succession, briefly transporting us back to those many days laying comatose around the golden record. Eventually our questions were exhausted, and the humans told us on a final note that it had been many generations since ships had stopped sending messages back to them - but news of bigger and more impressive fleets had been coming back to them for years before that as humanity expanded outwards amongst the stars.


We left. Or rather, 8 engineers and I left. The remaining two were endowed with copies of my notes on the human language and volunteered to stay behind on the decaying station - determined to get the systems working so that they could listen to the music stored digitally within.


Not far now. We followed the signal as far as we could go until we hit a solar system that perfect resembled the diagram bestowed upon us by voyager. Indeed, the amount of junk hurtling past our ship indicated that we were near the epicentre of the human exodus. The home world, Earth. 


Interestingly our radio had grown silent again, and as we passed the 6th planet Earth came into view. Then the 5th planet, then the 4th. Until we finally reached the far side of Earth's moon. Scans showed that attempts to terraform it's atmosphere and landscapes had been made - with genetically engineered organisms present in the atmosphere samples collected. Yet it had fallen short, most likely due to solar winds stripping the oxygen away before reaching breathable levels. A few faculties remained though, and on them we detected a sole life form sleeping. No one else, just this one last human amongst a meteor battered metal jungle of tunnels and atriums.

.________."
Micelight,WritingPrompts,1389705655.0,"We moved our attention onto Earth and were stunned. In stark contrast to what humans had breathed in the single living colony we had observed, the atmosphere of Earth was ideal for us! Almost no gaseous oxygen present, high levels of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and Carbon monoxide - and a small amount of methane. It was perfection for us. Yet not a single life form could be read on the planet. Every single organism was either dead or missing. The signal ended here; we were knocking, and no one was home.


Through our dismay precipitated relief. What could have been waiting for us had we met them? The same creatures had produced *mining* ships that rivaled the mightiest Capitol ships of the Directorate in size and power. Perhaps not so much of a loss after all? One could only postulate at the time. Though our mission wasn't done. Not yet. The tech on Earth was amongst the most primitive we had encountered yet, and with little difficulty we were able to access an information bank orbiting Earth (satellite, in effect) - a collection of knowledge broadcasting to a dead world. We read about their brutal wars shaping how they were (in stark contrast to what voyager had shown us), discoveries of how music and rhythms were embedded in humanity on a genetic level, and then - a history collection. A history of humanity that mentioned the voyager on a year (almost exactly the same as a rotation actually) known as 1977. 


What had taken us millions of rotations to achieve by was done in less than *ten thousand* by humans! What can one say to that? A race so rapid in advancing forward towards the technological plateau (the theoretical point at which technology would have to violate the laws of physics in order to be improved beyond perfection) could wipe out the entire known galaxy should it have the whim, and all we'd know about it would be the whistle of a single missile. What had we done? We had broadcast our exact coordinates along a timeline of human wreckages throughout space - the most modern being the closest to home! Had we skipped past them during FTL jumps? Had we been detected but given the leisure of life as a reward for showing them the way home? Where were they!?... The pictures! Had they, a race shaped by war with their first alien contact (read on), been scared off by our appearance? Or the opposite...


But we weren't done here. Not yet. We kept reading through the data banks. Humanity had been pillaged at one point by it's first contacted  ""extra terrestrials,"" a race of what resembled insects (on their own planet - they resemble nothing within the Directorate) tearing through the fledgling species' colonies with ferocity that had been met with what we had learned was what humanity did best. War. The concept of a Pyrrhic victory had been used to turn the tides, and eventually they had brought the species to it's knees - then extinction. They were machines. their ability to harness oxygen as an energy source allowed their metabolisms and biological processes to go at extreme speeds unknown to us, brain function included. Where we relied on automatons for speed, they merely used them as a supplement. They lived for maybe 100 rotations, maybe 120, but they reproduced exponentially to produce generation upon generation of soldiers who could not only withstand what was thought to be an environment impossible for sustaining life, but thrived in it.


Ancient history gave way to modern history, and I read out to the crew about the 'surge.' Humanity's aggressive push outwards. Remember how our species had evolved by moving outwards like ripples in a pond? This was a ""tsunami,"" a single shockwave to crush any extra terrestrials in their path, with any subsequent ripples minuscule in comparison. 


And that's where the realisation came in. The modern wreckages close to our outer worlds but juuuust out of contact, how long ago were they abandoned? 100 rotations by the looks of the projected data relayed to me by the satellite. Whatever grand notion we had of knocking on humanity's door was well and truly finished; very soon they would be knocking on ours with a fury so fierce it was hereditary.


We left the dead planet. We left the dead solar system. We left the dead sub-sector. We left the dead sector. We back tracked past all the derelict and destroyed signs of humanity we had passed, and with the greatest haste began making our way home.


I'm broadcasting this on all frequencies in all directions. Enclosed in a simple format are diagrams of humans, their anatomy, known weaponry (outdated by a thousand years at least. I'm so sorry), optimum biological conditions, language notes and my own recount of what we discovered. If we never meet, be warned that more than one golden record was sent out, and more than one plaque detailing their friendly intentions was shot from their homeworld. Should you find one, do not prepare for war. Prepare to flee. Run, just ""fucking"" run. ""Hell hath no fury"" like the humans, and they are coming in all directions, like a tsunami heading for the shore."

**Top Ten Reasons To Adopt A Black Dog:**


- We cannot clash with your furniture or clothing, and some of you actually worry about that.

- We cannot clash with any collar you might choose either! Ditto for bandannas. Accessorize us!

- Ease of vacuuming! You can quickly spot the areas of most urgent need.

- Excellent night walk protection, the ""bad guy"" won't see us til it's too late!

- We hide dirt well (doesn't mean we don't need that bath after a messy play, but your guests won't be able to see it so quickly).

- We make an excellent ""backdrop"" for a second, more colorful dog if you choose to have more than one.

- Availability! We are available now at every shelter you can imagine, in every age bracket, no long waiting lists, no long search!

- Status symbol potential. Black pearls are the most costly you know....

- No annoying queries ""what kind of dog is that"" people are content with ""big black dog"" and don't ask!


- We need you!"

If so, is it because they're paying me some attention, or because we really hit it off so well, or am I just over analysing this? Would spending more time with them or getting to know them increase these desires, or make them subside?

I had a crush on a male friend when I first met him. What I was kinda falling for was the way I imagined he wanted me. I continued to hang out with him and get to know things he liked and other things like that. I, now, know that, yes, he's still awesome...I don't fit his 'type' and quite frankly, he only fits my attractive meter when he's done up and quiet.

p3ndulum,changemyview,1389705878.0,"It's a class/caste thing - the definition of cliques, or like putting on a uniform.

If you're on the same team, you wear the same uniform, that way nobody is insecure about passin the ball (information) to the wrong person.

If you're not wearing the uniform, it's a statement that says that you don't belong there.

That's why companies have things like Casual Friday on a company-wide basis, setting the standard that says ""ok team, we're all going to be wearing the 'away'/alternate uniform on Friday"".

In the case if the Oscars, for example, the ""team"" uniform is designer brand names and labels. If it's a banquet for the city's firefighters, the uniform is, well, an actual uniform. If it's a board meeting at a Fortune 500 company, it's suits and ties.

Without the uniforms, things could potentially get convoluted, and you might have to deal with party crashes at some point.

Also, the way we dress has an effect on how we speak and behave. Like how wearing an Armani suit would make you hesitate to play in a sandbox or go mountain biking, a pair of flip flops and shorts might make it difficult for you to take things seriously at a cancer fundraiser - or, at least, not be *taken* seriously.

""Dressing up"" is mostly about creating definition than anything, even though you're right about it having little to do with the information that is being exchanged."

shor,mtgfinance,1389705911.0,"I would have thought most speculators would have been following the potential of this card and buying up as appropriate... 

If Corbin is truly the cause of the jump by posting that article, then the people on this subreddit are being spoonfed specs.

Chas Andres made Tectonic Edge one of his standout picks one month ago (16th December) on SCG:

&gt; Tectonic Edge is an even bigger target of mine—it sees play as a four-of in a bunch of winning lists and is my pick for the uncommon most likely to make the run from $2.50 up to $8-$10 this season.

From that time to today, over a dozen subscribers on the QS forum were heavily recommending the merits of this card as a spec.

1.  It is one of the most heavily played cards in Modern http://mtgstocks.com/analytics/mostplayed (15th most played card), 
http://www.mtgtop8.com/topcards (10th)
and http://mtgdecks.net/formats/view/Modern#mostPlayedCards-tab (7th)

1. Its relative supply is outstripped by demand, even for an uncommon, as Tect Edge is from a block which was opened in 2010 at a rate only two years into MTG's golden run, well before the big open rates of the SOM, INN and RTR blocks.

That's just two instances I'm aware of, in addition to the most-played charts but I'm sure there were many examples on other forums, sites and tweets where speculation on Tectonic Edge was gathering momentum."

From the link in my previous comment: 
&gt; The	[2012] poverty rate for women (14.5 percent) was 3.5	 percentage points higher than it was for men (11.0 percent).	The	extreme poverty	rate for women (6.3 percent) was	1.5 percentage points	higher	than	it was for men (4.8 percent). 

""Extreme poverty"" is defined as income at or below 50% of the federal poverty line.

As far as reactions from people. All my friends knew I was getting it done. Afterwards was funny because people would either ask if I lost a lot of weight. Some of my guy friends said they really couldn't tell a difference in my boobs except that I looked skinnier in general. 

Pretty much all my girl friends have seen my boobs, and they all said they thought the scarring would be a lot worse. It's pretty faded now and I doubt anyone would even notice.

How buying cheap goods from third world country where h&amp;s and employees working rights are not met very often is better than employing an immigrant in UK, possibly to work for cheaper but with the same rights as any other UK worker?

Also, what about moving customer services centres to India?

Aren't these also taking jobs from UK? Otherwise there would be customer services centres and more factories in UK (built by, staffed by, paid taxes by Brits, not Chinese or Indian).

Omega037,dating_advice,1389706095.0,"Well, for one thing it sounds like you might be dating a lot of girls with problems.  

That isn't too uncommon for a guy in his mid-20s, but I would take some time to reconsider how/where you are meeting women and their type.

It might also be worth nipping some of these reactions in the bud by saying ""oh, I don't do that kind of therapy"", even if you do.  Reiterate it if they keep trying to treat you as their therapist, and act like you have no clue what advice to give them.

That said, I am not a therapist and women I have dated have still liked to tell me about their problems.  Maybe not immediately or as detailed, but you should recognize that you might be getting some of this even if you were not a therapist.

As for number 3, consider this a free red flag before you get too invested.

I also think this will all change as you get older and the women you date are a bit more mature and professional."

Basically, ships are either stationary relative to each other, or moving in a single direction (ie: no turning/dodging), and the goal is to fire as many missiles as possible to overwhelm laser defenses. Laser defenses are laser guns that try to shoot down incoming missiles.

There are a few other tactics used in the books, including methods to try to blind the opponent's sensors so that the laser defenses are not as effective, or using laser defenses to try to cut through the enemy's ships."

Or somewhere where the only recognizable food is at McD's? Perhaps you would prefer to start small, travelling can be scary and overwhelming and some people find it good to start with an English speaking country first.  Then you can learn to deal with different currencies, customs, stores and food while at least having a common language. Or are you looking more for a wilderness hiking trip that doesn't depend on knowing the language?  If you want to start small try the Rhein hiking trails, some people will speak English because it is a tourist thing.  Or you could go South. If you are more interested in museums, history and castles, I would recommend Austria.  I would only suggest going to Asia if you are really ready to jump head first into a completely different world. I had been to Asia before but when I moved to China it was a huge culture shock.

So we still exchanged gifts and things like we always did.  We went shopping together and attended movies together.  Sex either came before or after our outings.  It was great.  So for us, number 4 wouldn't apply because we always asked each other about our day through phone calls and such.

relates_to_my_dick,AskReddit,1389706473.0,"I used to run at night at a park near my apartment. Not really sure why, I guess it just was relaxing to have the place to my self. Anyway, on Wednesday spring break last year, I was walking to the park which is literally across the street from the other side of the complex. As I walk down the side of the complex, I'm texting somebody when I suddenly hear ""don't look."" Now, my hearing isn't that good, so I look and ask ""what?"" Not a great move. Next thing I know, I'm slammed into a wall with four guys, one with a gun, over me. They proceed to rip my pockets to take everything in them, but they wanted my phone the most. When they cocked the gun and put it to my head, it realized I had no idea where it was, especially since it was dark and I was spinning from being beat over the head a few times now. After rapidly searching for a minute around me while screaming ""I don't wanna die,"" they ran off, I assume because I was attracting attention by doing so. The thing that pissed me off was that the moment they left, several people came outside who said they saw the whole thing. None had called the cops or thought to come outside (one group of people was like five big dudes who would scared off my attackers no problem). I don't blame them for wanting to stay safe, but I felt so alone at that moment and scared, being attacked and  knowing they all saw. Needless to say, I don't run at night anymore. In fact I don't really like being outside at night by myself without a friend or something, but at least I got my phone the next morning. "

And it assumes a certain familiarity with the bulk stores themselves in order to devise such a system, which people may not have if they've never personally known someone with a membership. As a single grad student living in the US, I've thought about sharing a Costco membership with a couple of other students and decided that for the above reasons, it was more of a hassle than it was worth.

At the university I attend, university employees are eligible for a free transit pass because there's a bad traffic/parking problem on campus and the school is trying to incentivize transit use. (Students don't get a free pass, but are eligible for a reduced student rate.) However, the school contracts out a lot of the low-wage jobs on campus, such as food service in the cafeterias. These workers aren't university employees; they work for the contractor.

Psythik,pcmasterrace,1389707321.0,"For running on 8-year-old hardware I'll admit the game looks pretty damn good. On PC it has the potential to look amazing.

There's a few problems I have with the game:

1. Single player is *way* too short. Like 1/4 the length of GTA IV. The characters are as uninteresting as the story, and the missions are boring and repetitive, even more so than IV.

2. There isn't enough to do, especially online. There are even *fewer* enterable buildings this time, and multiplayer consists of not much more than racing, deathmatches, and farming the same mission over and over again for cash. The lack of stuff to do turns players into assholes. If someone decides they don't like you, they can call for a tank and kill you over and over again. If you haven't saved up the $1.5 mil required to buy your own (which takes forever since most missions pay less than $5k), there's nothing you can do except leave the server since you respawn too close to where you died. 

IMO the only fun part about online is customizing your car. And even then that's rendered pointless because 99% of hosts turn Catchup on for races, which speeds or slows down cars to keep everybody neck and neck, completely taking the skill out of racing and defeating the whole purpose of tuning your car for performance to begin with.

The only way to have fun in GTA Online is to farm missions to earn money fast, because if you're not a multi millionaire in the game you're gonna get constantly owned by everybody else with their tanks, fighter jets, and upgraded guns. I literally spent an entire day doing the same mission over and over again just so I could have enough money to keep up with the bad boys. That isn't exactly my idea of fun."

One goes to a poorer neighborhood where many of the low-wage workers (food service, custodial services) live. This is the longest shuttle route -- the neighborhoods close to campus are much more expensive, so someone with a low-paying job can't afford to live any closer. It's about 15 miles each way, which is a long way to commute by bike, especially for someone who may be older or in poor health. Thankfully the university shuttle buses are free for students/employees, but not everyone has an employer willing to provide them with a free ride to work.

silverionmox,changemyview,1389707563.0,"&gt;Without the Euro or at least with a way out of the Euro this crisis wouldn't be as bad. Greece and Ireland could simple devalue their currency and export their way out of trouble. 

... Just like they didn't do before the euro? Periodic devaluations bork the buying power of wages of ordinary Greeks and Irish just as surely. Besides, according to that criterium the American Southwest and the Great Plains should be kicked out of the dollarzone...

&gt;A new, smaller EU could be more careful of allowing members in the central currency.

That's always nice, but besides the point (only Greece cooked the books, anyway). Accidents can and do happen. If you're going to have a currency at all, you need to accept that your central bank needs to back it up by acting as a lender of last resort for the states in it. The problem was not the eurozone an sich, but the policy.

&gt;The variety between countries allow for more economic and social policies to be tested.

That can still be done. Schengen was done by a few select countries and adopted later by others when the sky didn't fall. Most EU regulation is coordination rather than specific policies anyway.

&gt;Less bureaucracy, naturally

The EU has reduced bureaucracy significantly by coordination. An example: the European card allows me to enjoy healtcare in any EU country, it will simply be paid by the insurer in my home country. Instead of potentially having to deal with 28 health insurance systems, now it's vastly simplified.

&gt;More room for trade agreements with countries outside of the EU instead of the one Europe trading arrangement.

It's incomprehensible that you want your companies to deal with 28² bilateral treaties rather than the single Common Market... and that's just Europe. As the biggest market, the EU has such an influence that their standards are effectively the world standards in many areas.

&gt;More democracy as decisions are closer to the people that affect them.

I do agree that the EP should have more power, but it's the national governments who would rather hold their power and therefore block further democratization of the EU. The subsidiarity principle is well enough known and applied in the EU, anyway.

&gt;No spending on things unrelated or unwanted. If a country doesn't want a military, fine.

Would you also think that individual cities and towns in countries should be able to opt out of paying for the military?

&gt;Less protectionism. EU agricultural policy cripples African states.

olivermihoff,TheRedPill,1389707628.0,"Possible spoilers below, read at your own risk -

I saw it as a great movie also. It contrasted expectations placed on him by his wife during their relationship and her need for him to be outwardly ""emotional"" with her as something that men don't want (i.e. someone that constantly pushes your buttons). As a non-confrontational (yet resolute) person in my own relationships, that theme hit hard with me.

Also the idea that the OS was servicing several people at the same time was so true for females that have good personalities, they are often ""cheaters"" when they have great personality traits and communication skills. This is often true in real life as I've noticed.

The OS symbolized all the qualities most would want in a real woman, e.g. communication, dedication, availability, reliability, motivation, and someone who doesn't constantly challenge them to evoke anger or jealousy or other emotional outbursts... I guess if I didn't face challenges the relationship might get boring, but it's still much better than a constant state of arguing and obligation whereas a woman should add happiness to my life that outweighs negativity in most cases as I would for her.

It's a scary view of a ""way too believable"" future, I mean, this is exactly why they're working so hard on developing AI. Japan is having severe problems with population growth because people are becoming so isolated and embedded in personal technology. We're all frustrated with reality, and it makes us become undesirable people and poor communicators (socially) because our social skills suffer from being isolated even if our looks may not be what's hurting us.

The movie also reminded me a lot of Lost In Translation, the typical theme of loneliness and unfulfilled happiness and then settling for mediocrity of regular life rather than the happy endings of typical Hollywood movies. I enjoy movies without ""happy endings"" though, they balance out the other crap that Hollywood puts out."

And second, you're compartmentalizing the hand when you suggest that it'a spewy. Besides the fact that making adjustments is easy, there is an image and a meta game to consider.

Regardless of the hand, 4-betting here sends a message that if you're going to 3-bet from the blinds, you better have it. That way, the next time it happens, there's a higher probability of it (BB's hand) actually being a premium hand.

So for the cost of a single 4-bet early in the session, I've made it a little bit easier to play against my opponent for the rest of the session.

And then, the next time I open on his big blind from the c/o, I'm doing it with either a hand that I don't mind flatting with while in position against a premium hand, or I'm doing it with an actual premium hand myself.

If I have to flat, I'm getting excellent implied odds (assuming the stacks are deep), and if I have a hand like Aces or Kings, he'll surely consider the fact that I've now 4-bet him twice in a row - and now he has a chance to over play a strong, but still weaker hand than ours.

I'm also advocating playing in a way that allows opponents to assign whatever value they want to my hand, which regularly forces them into playin their hands face-up.

If I'm 4-betting here, I know that if my opponent just flats my raise, he probably doesn't have a very strong hand, which means that there will be plenty if flops where we can steal a decent sized pot while having almost no equity at all, which means that there's little chance of getting into a lot of trouble if we get played back at after the flop.

We also don't have to show our cards in that situation, so as far as our opponent is concerned, we could still have *anything*. And it's important to keep your opponents believing whatever they want to believe, but for them to not ever actually see our cards unless it's a winning hand (or was, at least, when all of the chips went in).

I'm talking about playing at a level where the cards don't matter. I'm talking about playing the man and letting him beat himself.

Because until the cards are face up on the table, they don't really matter.

At least, that's how *I've* learned how to play the game - I know that most others see things very differently than I do."
Analog265,LifeProTips,1389707766.0,"&gt; How is quite reasonably wanting to be paid back 'making it about you'.

Read the second part of that sentence and you'll see why. I don't even get why you're asking why I said that when i literally expanded on it right after. He seemed to have some cognitive bias where neglecting to pay back a couple bucks amounts to a huge, conscious betrayal worthy of ending the relationship.

&gt;Like gsxr I think, I respect and trust and place reasonable expectations on my friends in both small and large matters.

I wouldn't say an issue with a small deal of money is much of an indicator of respect and trust at all, its an issue of financial management. If someone was truly disrespectful or untrustworthy, it should have been very clear beforehand. I maintain that ""can i depend on him to pay back 20 bucks"" is a poor test of character.

&gt;Nothing wrong with that, but don't start beating us up about it and smearing a reasonable attitude.

I just think certain things that guy said seem quite petty, greedy even. It kind of makes me think a little negatively of his character when he tells me his best friends aren't worth sacrificing 50 dollars."

begreppet gubbslem är i botten bara ytterligare ett försök att manipulera män till att acceptera ""korrekta"" åsikter genom att framställa dem som åsikterna man bör ha för att få ligga

The sandy hills now silent, the echoes of screams and clatter of swords on shield long since lost on the horizon.
The chant echoed out now as the Rogashu shouted, ""On wards to death, left right left. Looking for life, right left right.""
The winter winds blew in and Thanes shoulder began to freeze, but as the son and heir to reputations of the legendary Count Darten he must not show his weakness. Thane had been, like all Darten clans men, abandoned as a child and it was accepted that if he was worth while he would survive. Alone men either became proud and free or they died.
His first few days passed by without major incident, but after killing a wild boar with a stick and nursing his own dislocated shoulder at 6 years old he learned what all Rogashu knew and what the Darten clan lived 'that it was a great insult to not push a life for all its worth and seek its most pure potential.""
He sought out greater prey, like his father and his father's father he fought bears and beasts and wore hide and by fifteen he returned to his Nomadic tribe, A man.

The burning camp had failed, the children enslaved and the women raped as the men died. Unworthy they never truly fought us.
They only battled to survive, but never aiming to win. Competitive no, their violence was fueled by hate or revenge and some sense of justice, but Rogashu knew that their was no world beyond the mortal plane and no great justice only survival and death.

Thane looked to his father the fourth Count Darten riding a large black horse and dragging the severed head of the camp leader behind him, ""My lord, why do we disgrace their leader?"" Looking at the gaunt face bounce in the earth, ""his children and women, why must we punish and violate them?"" His body still warm with the touch of the women and their cages full of children to sell, ""forgive me am I knew to this.""
He was, this was Thanes first battle at the forefront of his clan.
His father sighed ""we seek better, the people will hear of our crimes and the cost of defeat and they will fight us more valiantly for it,"" his father smiled, ""we do not torment dead men, we motivate the living.""

Embracing_the_Pain,loseit,1389707857.0,"Honestly, looking at your lists, I would say taking all of your unhealthy habits, and change them into healthy habits.

* Stop eating fast food.
* Stop overeating. Find a different way to deal with stress.
* Get on a regular sleep schedule.
* Find a gym program you can do and make it a regular habit.
* Get out more and be more sociable. Find a club or a hobby that requires you to spend time with other people.

Now trying to do everything on that list at once is a huge order. Don't worry about trying to do everything at once. Tackle it one at a time. Start by not eating fast food. For the next 400 days, cut out fast food completely. If you want to go a step further, stop eating out entirely. No fast food, no restaurants, and if you can no frozen meals.

Commit the next 400 days to only eating food that you cook and make yourself. It's a great transition to eating healthier, and eating less food. Plus, it will be way cheaper than eating fast food constantly. Think about this. The average fast food meal is around $10. Times that be three, and then by seven, and you will have spent $210 a week on food, which is $840 a month, and $10,080 a year just on fast food. Imagine how much natural and healthy food you could get for that at the grocery store. And if you're just buying food for yourself, it's easy to get a good amount of food for half that weekly fast food budget. 

Save that money and spend it on something really awesome for your 30th birthday. You're already on the right path to leading a healthy lifestyle, now it's time to make some tweaks to put the finishing touches on it. You can do it!"

First download networx or another bandwidth usage tool so you can know how much data you are pulling down. This way you will know for sure if you are actually saving anything. 

The next part assumes you have access to a spare computer/laptop and a place that has uncapped internet like your parents house or something. 

You can use this computer and install the software from logmein.com on it. This will allow you to connect to the computer remotely over the internet and stream the screen as well as audio from the computer. So basically you leave that computer on wherever it is and when you want to remote into it you go to the website and with a few clicks you are in. For me it is showing about a tenth the data usage when streaming a youtube video at 1080p which is my screen resolution. 

Remotedesktop is another option which does the same thing (although I dont know if it has audio) I am not as familiar with it but the logmein site is extremely easy to use. There are upgraded options for it but the free version works perfectly well. 

Basically what this does is have that other computer do all the downloading involved in streaming from sites like youtube or netflix and then you stream it remotely at a set bandwidth rate. "

Your selection of a blade material truly depends on what you need it to do.  Field dressing game go with 440 its soft but easy to sharpen, good pocket knife for everyday use I love 154cm since it stays sharp. 

A pen nib on the other hand doesn't need those attributes, its not (shouldn't be) cutting boxes, gutting game, or being sharpened.  Plus the tip is iridium, etc.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1389708310.0,"coming out is a very personal yet very important thing. the main thing is, is being ""in the closet"" keeping you from being happy? in some ways, i'd say yes to that question, based on what you are saying. some of your friends know, and they took it well, right? so that's a positive first step.

the most important thing is to be true to who you are. you are a private person. no one really needs to know what you do in bed or who you are doing it with. so if they don't need to know, don't tell them.

that said, i would at the very least say something to your immediate family. it doesn't have to be anything major and it doesn't have to be a big deal. simply, ""this is something that i've known and felt for many years, and it really hasn't seemed important to say anything, but i want you to know because you are an important part of my life. i'm gay.""

as for when friends or family talk about the ""hot girl in the miniskirt"" or whatever, if that makes you feel uncomfortable, just say that. ""hey, i'm sorry but that makes me feel uncomfortable. can we talk about something else?"" or ""i don't think sexualizing every woman you see is a good thing."" if they are good friends, and you are ok with it, why not say something about the hot barista? you don't have to make it sexual (a la the ""tenderize his meat"" comment) but something like ""wow, he has really nice eyes"" or ""the guy with the dimples is hot.""

the point is, whether you decide to ""come out"" (or when) you need to feel comfortable with yourself first. your sexuality is part of you but it isn't who you are. remember that."

myfriendscantknow,PurplePillDebate,1389708343.0,"Ok, here we go, then I have to get some sleep.

The Red Pill purports to have the actual truth about sexuality and gender, and offers advice on how to best manipulate it for your own goals. This truth is that men and women have very different romantic and sexual habits from each other, but mostly similar habits amongst themselves.

TRP focuses on women primarily, so I will too. Women are ""hypergamous"", meaning that they will always try to get the most attractive man possible to breed with and the most resource rich man to commit with, thus ""alpha fucks beta bucks"". This phenomena is still carried out in modern culture.

Women are also biologically more emotional and less rational than men, which is why it is good for their psychological well being to be dependent and submissive on an alpha man.

Women are also the selective gender. 20% of men sleep with 80% of women, because men want to sleep with many women and women want to sleep with good men.

Now culture. Feminism has done great harm to society. I won't get into actual political policy because that's more MR territory, but TRP holds that feminism has usurped the much better traditional relationship model and made women too entitled and not feminine or submissive enough. ""Girl power"" is not a good thing.

This shift has also given way to more promiscuity among women, which is a bad thing. It is bad because getting sex is easy for women. They are supposed to be the selective gender. Promiscuity will invariably lead to cheating in women, because they are hypergamous.

Also, promiscuous women will hit ""the wall"" in their early thirties. This is when their dating prospects will drastically decrease, because all men prefer younger women, while younger women still like older men.

All of this can be used to your advantage in multiple ways, depending on your goals. I'm not going to hash over every red pill ""tip"" like dread game, plate spinning, and agree and escalate though, this is already too long.

duckface08,Animesuggest,1389708496.0,"Depends on my mood and what kind of series I'm watching.

Typically, I pick up about 2-3 series every season and keep up with those on a weekly basis. Then, I usually have one or two other series that have finished airing to watch when I'm caught up on on-going series and am waiting for new episodes. For example, I'm currently keeping up with Hunter x Hunter, Kill la Kill, Magi (2nd season), Nagi no Asukara, Samurai Flamenco, and Toaru Hikuushi no Koiuta. Right at this moment, I'm caught up on all those series and am waiting for new episodes to be aired and subbed, so while I wait, I watch episodes of Scrapped Princess.

Sometimes, though, the completed series I'm watching ends up being so good that I end up marathoning it and falling behind on keeping up with my on-going series.

So, like I said, it just depends."

screenmagnet,sex,1389708542.0,"It's not really about the academics or IQ. It's about my level of independence and life experience. I left my family and moved to a different city at age 16 to start university. That's very different than a university student who still lives at home, is sheltered, and is micromanaged by mom and dad. My parents always gave me lots of independence. I went to high school in the downtown of a big metropolitan city. I was taking public transportation to school and back by myself from age 10. My parents never helped me with homework or even asked me where I was applying for university or what I wanted to study. I figured my career goals out on my own. Also, I started partying very, very young. Because I skipped a grade, my friends and classmates were always 1-2 years older than me. I started drinking at age 12, and smoking weed at age 13. My friends and I were having unsupervised coed parties and sleepovers by that time. I had unrestricted, unmonitored internet access at home, so I started reading and writing erotica and watching porn at age 11.

By the time I met my 28 year old 2nd bf at age 19, I already knew exactly what I wanted to do career wise, I was about to start my fourth and final year of undergrad (I said third year above, but that was a mistake), I had published research, I had lived on my own for 3 years, I had had sex with two guys, and I had experimented with cocaine, ecstasy, and most prescription drugs. So I had a lot more life experience under my belt than the average 19 year old girl. So yeah, I was able to handle a 28 year old grad student as my boyfriend."

welcome to life, bro.

it's possible that you just need to take a break from sex. try to do something with the guy you are interested in besides getting naked. go for a walk. get ice cream. go see a movie. watch a movie and snuggle on the couch. it doesn't mean that you are moving towards a ""relationship"" with whoever you are doing these things with, but it means that you are testing out being intimate with that person.

as for your actual sex drive, there are many things which can decrease your sex drive. first, as you get older, your drive will decrease. depression, certain medicines, and changes in the seasons (seasonal affective disorder) can all cause changes to your drive. take a few weeks off from trying to jack off or be sexual with someone. if it continues to be a problem, talk to your doctor.

Handyland,gainit,1389708885.0,"I can speak to a couple of your questions, but not all.

First off, how did you calculate your TDEE?  Most sites include a section about how many times per week you exercise, and how strenuously, or just how active in general you are.  If your calculator asked about these things, then 2400 should be an average; high for a low-activity day, low for a high-activity day.  Some people do adjust their calories based on activity, but it isn't necessary.  Just shoot for 300 calories more than your TDEE if you want to gain fairly lean mass, and more like 500 if you don't care quite as much about gaining some fat.  Be consistent.

As for number of meals, there isn't really any evidence that having 6 meals is better than 3 larger meals.  Some people eat more meals because they can't fit each larger meal in their stomach.  Since you have an office job, I'd recommend keeping it simple and sticking with less than 6 meals, otherwise you may find yourself having to work through some of your mealtimes, and missing out on calories.  The important thing is that, at the end of the day, you've hit your calorie goal, so choose however many meals that you'll actually have time to eat within the confines of your schedule.  Timing of meals aren't really important if you're having them throughout the day, though some people (/r/leangains) fool around with intermittent fasting like not touching food until noon.

I think you're overthinking things.  If you're a beginning lifter/gainer, just stick to a consistent and balanced lifting program, eat over your TDEE (see above), get plenty of protein in your diet (at least 120g), and eat a *relatively* balanced diet.  Hell, that last one isn't even strictly necessary for gaining, just for being healthy and perhaps *optimizing* gaining.  Just be careful about falling into the trap that many people here have; you start to think and worry too much about what you're doing in order to gain, and you end up either not being able to stick to a highly complex program, or not even starting one.  Don't overthink, just eat and lift."

&gt;Anyone who is genuinely concerned with falling birthrates should be supporting policies such as paid maternity leave, subsidized day care, flexible work schedules, affordable health care and so on that would make it feasible for more women who want babies to have them. As for the women who don't, we should be grateful in the knowledge that they are intelligent enough to make the choice that is best for them and then back off with the judgement

As far as myself, the only thing I'm certain of, is now someone will probably grossly misinterpret the information, and post it here as the crowning achievement of their rant about... whatever.

I'm actually against having too much interaction as it limits the exposure you can have to sentences and words - do you really need to write/type out ""日本"" or ""こんにちは"" 20 times when you could just write/type it once or twice when you're first learning them? In the time it takes to do that you could have looked at 1-3 more sentences/words depending on your speed/ability to recall.

Simbablk,sex,1389708981.0,"I've had this happen with one of my partners.  She told she *never* experienced orgasm during sex, so I was determined to make sure she did.  

It was a while before I found the right angle of attack to get her to cum from strictly PIV sex, so in the meantime, I found a way to make her cum while fingering her clit.  

In a position like **[this](http://www.sexinfo101.com/piratesbounty.shtml)** one, I was still inside of her while thumbing her clit.  This gave her the feeling of me still being inside of her while she built up to and subsequently had a full orgasm while I was still inside of her - until she pushed me out.  She had very powerful thighs.  That mixed with her involuntary upward thrust at the point of orgasm pushed me out of her and prevented her from being able to feel her orgasm while my cock was still inside her. 

To fix this, I had to overpower her the next time to make sure she felt it.  This meant putting a lot of muscle and power on her hips to keep her from bucking upwards and pushing me out - then driving deep into her so that she could feel the pulsing of her orgasm around my cock.  She loved it. 

So it happens - for varying reasons, but it happens.   "

I think the futurism of Back to the Future II was pretty ironic. It was a bit of a homage to Jetsons-type retro-futurism rather than the result of any great optimism. 1990 is well into the postmodern era, and after the dystopias of the 80s like Blade Runner and Alien.

professor__doom,Automate,1389709009.0,"&gt; What does the current state of productivity statistics look like

The chart[ here](http://money.cnn.com/2013/03/07/news/economy/compensation-productivity/) outlines the disparity I'm talking about.

&gt; I don't understand what that has to do with wealth distribution. 

Simple: manufacturing jobs pay better, at least in the US.  Manufacturing in Western countries is already highly automated, with a very high factory output/man-hour ratio.  The human jobs which remain in Western factories are tasks which are not easily automated.

Output per hour is a pretty standard definition of ""productivity.""  For a number of reasons, including the nature of the work and the continued strength of unions in the manufacturing trades, income has actually kept pace with productivity gains in the manufacturing sector, instead of lagging behind inflation like it has in most sectors.  Shifting manufacturing activities from overseas to onshore operations means more and better-paying jobs for working and middle class Americans.

And manufacturing jobs have fewer entry barriers.  Because of the highly specific nature of the work, many manufacturing jobs--some of which pay [very well](http://www.indeed.com/salary/q-Caterpillar-Heavy-Equipment-Service-Technician-l-Jackson,-MS.html)--don't require the massive time and financial commitment of a college degree, since only industry experience can contribute to job performance.

&gt; Irrelevant. You might do more harm identifying your identity than if you just let your views stand on their own, because it reframes the discussion into a Red vs Blue debate instead of two sets of beliefs in any selected combination.

I think it's relevant, as it points out how nobody with real political influence is even talking about these issues.  Both parties have just taken on different flavors of the ""makers vs takers"" argument.  The only difference between the two parties' rhetoric is which class is the ""makers"" and which class is the ""takers:"" Democrats blame ""the 1%"" and Republicans blame ""welfare queens"" for all our problems.  Two different versions of the same zero-sum, class-warfare line of bogus.

Neither even hints at the possibility that our problems might be international, rather than intranational, in nature.

I'm just bringing up the point that there used to be--and not long ago--influential voices in BOTH parties who advocated policies which favored American manufacturing and small businesses--and by extension, skilled employment--over offshoring and the ""walmartization"" of the American economy.  This sort of thought has disappeared from both parties, but I feel that the loss is especially pronounced in the GOP, where my sort of thinking on trade used to thrive."

silverionmox,changemyview,1389709085.0,"&gt; However come to the trading agreements. With the Europe having a single trade zone means each nation trades at the same tariffs or taxes. Now this is probably beneficial for countries which would get detrimental conditions attached or who trade mostly with other European states. Its not beneficial for those with strong outside links like the UK who can't have free trade agreements with the commonwealth, which is quite possibly a more important market, certainly a growing one. It already runs a trade deficit with the EU giving it a stronger standing point. 

I wonder why the UK has never made a point of promoting a positive project in Europe (trade treaties with commonwealth countries), for once.

&gt;Examples being the prisoner vote

Remind me what that is.

&gt; the enforced austerity

That's a matter of policy, rather than a fault of the EU. In addition, the EU only used it as a policy guideline because most governments of countries thought it was the right policy, anyway.

&gt;unelected officials

Elected bodies delegating executive power to non-elected officials is common practice in democratic governments.

&gt;A country is forced to follow the pack simply by the tyranny of the majority.

How can you think that? National governments cling to their veto powers, and that is the reason that for example the double seat of the European Parliament, the fishing quota etc. aren't resolved satisfactorily yet: individual governments can and do use their vetoes.

&gt;Two last points; the EU bureaucracy cannot be stopped. There are too many vested interests, too many countries out for free money over competition. If reforms were possible we'd have seen something by now. If the largest recession since the second world war can't stop it, nothing can.

These are just feelings of negativity that are so vague that they can never be proved or disproved.

&gt;Basically city states but they haven't needed to be taken in to larger countries and are some of the richest places on the planet.

Not everywhere can be a trading center. The EU has increased intra-European trade with 10%, fyi.

&gt;but the UK has London, which is what the EU is truly after when they seek the UK to join the Eurozone.

&gt;Good agility requires a combination of speed, balance, power and co-ordination.

Each one of those is a core component of being able to swim fast and well. So quite the contrary to your statement, swimming times are very relevant. The problem being you, like many, only think of agility in the classical sense of running. 

As for flexibility tests I would concede that women would probably out perform men. And would no doubt out perform them in the classic sit and reach test.

CrabCow,iRacing,1389709593.0,"I've been really enjoying this car/track combo because that car is a bucket of fun right up until you clip the rumble strip (Especially on turns 6 and 7 because you have to keep 100% of your grip there if you want a solid chance of a good exit speed)

It's just difficult. The whole week I have maybe two races where I was finishing 0x and I raced well over 20-30 races. It's hard to dodge some of the people who ride too hard, just be careful how you brake (Don't do more than a small dab of brakes in turns and gas to keep stable) and it can do some amazing times.

Now with Laguna Seca, this is a strange change for me. I love Laguna Seca and the MX-5 is INSANELY fun to drive on this track but getting a perfect race here is so difficult because, let's be honest, it's hard to go 10 laps without you losing it around the corkscrew (Or on it) or someone else losing it. I start last usually for these races and I probably won't try to qualify because I rather stay back and watch for those ""loose"" drivers. There is almost always an accident on turn 2 (Hairpin-like turn), as well as turns 6 (The very fast follow through before corkscrew), turn 8 (Corkscrew), and turn 9 (Extremely fast downhill after Corkscrew)... Nevertheless, I wouldn't say Lime Rock Park or Mazda's Laguna Seca are bad choices of track for the car, it's all about turning into those turns at Lime Rock (Turns 1+2 with how it thins, and that swift uphill turn 5 too, Turn 7 is a chance to pick up insane speed if you're smooth (100+ mph exit, if you're ballsy and skilled, 105+ mph))

**TL;DR: Lots of fun once you figured out the MX-5 on Lime Rock Park, Laguna Seca is scarier because few know how to turn in correctly and lose it, so you must drive defensively and carefully.**"
neotecha,asktransgender,1389709597.0,"On T, I had developed what my family referred to as a stocky build, which -- even when I was at my absolute healthiest (in terms of physical endurance and strength) -- I was always a bit over the top in terms of BMI. 

Now, it is a one of the areas that will trigger me if I think about it too much. Part of the problem is that I've gained a lot of weight since I was younger, so my band size is higher than I feel it should be. 

As you lose weight from spiro/androcur (which reduces the testosterone in your body, your muscles will lose mass, so the muscles in your shoulders will shrink down which will reduce the apparent size of your muscles.

Finally, you have to recognize that people aren't going to see your shoulders in the same light that you do. It's very possible that your shoulders would be in a normal female range, but you have your expectations too high. Note that when I say ""normal female range"", I'm talking what a cis girl might have, not what a cis model would have."

given his history, i can understand that. i'm sorry to sound harsh, but you knew that he had been lied to in the past. how can he trust you? trust, once broken, is hard to repair.

&gt; I had no friends! We were on a break. He could have been seeing other guys back in America too that he could have lied about too!

yes, he could have been cheating on you. he could have lied too, but unless he has (which there is no evidence of) this is a way for you to justify what you did.

if you want to keep him, you need to find out from him what you can do to fix it. first thing, for sure, is you need to tell him everything that happened. no lies, no half-truths, and no trying to put the blame on anyone else. even saying ""i was drunk and didn't know what i was doing"" is an excuse, because you weren't drunk when you lied, or when you sent the message to the other guy telling him to lie to your bf too. second, i would see if you can get him to go with you to a couples councilor. you have several issues to work through and it will take having someone there who is a neutral party to help. it can work, but you both have to want it enough to work on it."

Yield, while obviously influenced by light, nutes, etc - is most basically defined by the number of flowering sites you have. The above-mentioned techniques are intended to produce more. Read up. Experiment."

HalfysReddit,AskReddit,1389710004.0,"You drain the old oil out of the engine. You replace the old oil filter, and then fill the engine back up with fresh, new oil.

The oil is a lubricant, and over time metal shavings and other dirt cause it to not lubricate as well. So you need to replace it every now and again to keep your engine running smoothly.

You should check your car manual to see how often you should change your oil. For example, I drive a '94 Toyota Camry and my manual calls for me to change the oil every 7500 miles.

You can go to a shop and pay them thirty bucks or so to do it, or you can do it yourself if you have a floor jack and a pan to catch the old oil in (the fresh oil and filter shouldn't cost you more than twenty bucks altogether). Having someone else do it is convenient, but you need to trust them not to fuck with your car, and you're also paying them ten bucks or so for about ten minutes worth of labor."

Apparently, most red birthmarks fade after infancy/childhood and most of them appear on faces/necks rather than limbs, but mine is as strongly pigmented as it's ever been and hasn't changed over the years at all.

Physiology-wise, I don't get my period very often. I went to see a doctor about it a few years ago and she ran a few tests, all of which came back normal. She said that if it's not bothering me and I don't go for *too* long without menstruating, I can just keep going the way I'm going.

Simbablk,sex,1389710071.0,"Focus.  I find really learning to focus on my pleasure allows me the ability to cum at will (most times).  I can either fuck for over an hour or fuck for 15min - depending on how I focus my energy and process the feeling in and around my cock.  

As a result, I too often end up ending sex without me ejaculating - but I *like* this!  I enjoy the feeling of sexual energy coursing through my body.  It feels awesome.  It also gets me going for the next round (I sometimes battle with low libido - this really helps).  If sex goes too long, the woman can get sore and not want sex later - so after she's had a few orgasms, I simply pull out and stop.  It gives us both a break and let's the feeling subside if I were getting close to orgasm.  

If having sex without ejaculation is not a problem, then don't make it one.  Make it part of your sexual repertoire!  Make it something you do during sex and something she gets used to.  When you cum, you'll cum hard and it'll be great.  When you don't, you'll be horny and want sex again and again.  It makes the sex more mysterious and unknown!  Will he cum or won't he?"

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1389710115.0,"First of all: threatening to kill one's self to keep a partner in a relationship is a recognized form of emotional abuse and manipulation. This relationship is over and should not - *cannot* - continue under those circumstances. 

I suggest you call her mom, explain to her that because of the obvious circumstances you can no longer date your girlfriend, and you're concerned about how she's going to take it. Alert the mom that she needs to keep a close on on her daughter from now on. How you break up with her is kinda tricky - normally I would never suggest this, but maybe write her a kind letter wishing her the best but making it clear that you two can no longer be together. *Make it clear*: don't say 'take a break' or anything that can give her the idea you two will get back together. If you do it in person or over the phone she will likely get very upset, and will almost certainly try to manipulate you with suicide threats. 

This isn't to sound cruel - she is clearly going through a very difficult time and must be hurting inside a lot. But it is not your fault. She didn't try to kill herself because of you, she tried to kill herself because she has much, much larger issues that luckily she is receiving help for. You're 17. You can't help her. She has support from people who can - her parents, a counseller, and doctors. Keep telling yourself - this is not your fault.

You are about 5cm above average in my country, which has an average of 179cm for men in the 18-35 y/o bracket. So, you're tall-ish to me.

However, at *only* 6', you'd be considered '*average, for a girl*', in this subreddit.

2012 GTI 2-door 6-speed, bone stock

&gt; What are the good things and what are the bad things?

The interior, the Detroit wheels, the handling as all great. This is the first good car I've ever owned after a couple of hand-me downs and a couple of Cavaliers, so it's a big change. I've taken it autocrossing a couple of times and that's a hoot.  The bad... well it's already been scratched by the rear wheel well and I put two curb marks on one of the wheels because I wasn't used to how it turned when parking. Once in a while I get a rattle/clunk near the back passenger side that I can't figure out. And it's needed aligned twice and a new water pump in 22K miles, not sure if I dig that. 

&gt; How much did you pay?

About $25K. It was one of the few 2012s on the lot after the 13s came out so I went for the finance deal and they took a few bucks off. 

&gt; Anything special about your car?

Nope, bone stock. Once the warranty is gone at the end of the year I might mod a little. I want a set of Potenzas (for autocross) once the stock tires go. 

&gt; Would you buy it again?

I sure would. I wanted a practical car that was also fun and good on gas. It's easy for my elderly dog to get into and the back seats are surprisingly roomy for those few times I have passengers. If I had to shop again I would drive a WRX and possibly a Focus though, I guess the newer GTIs are going to be assembled in Mexico and based on what I've heard about the quality in the Beetle and Golf I don't know if I like that. 

&gt; Any funny stories?

I ground the wheel on a curb literally one week after taking delivery, and the only reason I was parking there is because the Bluetooth helpfully informed me there was no phone found (I'd forgotten it at work). I was reminded of the old Eddie Murphy sketch about cars talking to you ""_ding_... Some one stole your battery... I say we go get the motherfucker!""

Also, yes, I too took it up to max MPH for a few minutes on the interstate"
Ralkir,changemyview,1389710361.0,"&gt;No. Speed is only a minor factor and balance is absolutely useless. I will agree that it is a matter of power and coordination, and which one is more important depends on the stroke. The end result is that the physical requirements are different enough for it to not be useful as a measurement.

Wrong again. Balance is completely necessary, that is your body position in the water. Speed is a factor, it even said so in the link YOU provided. 

&gt;I would call running raw speed. I think of agility as the ability to change directions.

The ability to change directions while....running. Regardless, the link that YOU provided listed the traits of agility. All of which are core components to swimming as already stated and illustrated. "

I am just checking a few numbers on a German salary page. Looks like the average salary of a lawyer is almost equal to a developer. Always thought they would earn much more. But I guess this is just very dependent on where you work. A few weeks back I've watched a documentation about sales persons in a furniture store. Now I don't know if that's the usual salary, but some of them are earning like 10,000€ a month including bonuses for sales.

Handyland,gainit,1389710394.0,"First off, read the FAQ if you haven't already.

Appetite: Your appetite is limited right now, and is a large part of why you're a skinny dude.  What you need to do is force yourself to eat more.  You will adjust to the larger volume of food, and suddenly eating 1500 calories in a single sitting won't be a big deal any more.  Maybe try eating more frequently for now while you build your appetite, or make large amounts of food and just stay at the table for over an hour while you make yourself finish it.  Eating isn't going to be the most pleasant thing to do for a couple weeks while you try and ""grow your stomach"", if you will.  You should be constantly full, and if you aren't, you should be going to get food.

Stuff like GOMAD is suggested because it is really easy to drink some of your calories in.  Tons of people are fat in part due to high soda consumption.  However, drinking a ton of soda is terrible for you, so milk (or chocolate milk, or other healthy drinks) are suggested.  Milk is a good source of protein as well.  GOMAD is not at all necessary for gaining, but can be useful to supplement your diet.  I'm getting the sense that you're not really trying that hard to put down food though...a quarter of a gallon is 4 cups.  You couldn't drink 4 cups of milk over the course of a 16 hour day?  A while back, I had slowly increased my milk intake over the course of several weeks and managed to drink up to a half a gallon a day without really trying.  You just need to actually put in some effort to make yourself eat and drink more, because if you can't put down 4 glasses of a drink in one day, you aren't trying.  That's 2 ounces an hour.  As for what to eat?  Eat whatever you can eat a lot of.  Just make sure you're getting enough protein and calories.

It would probably be helpful to start counting calories if you haven't started.  Read the FAQ for details on how to find you TDEE and then either eat ~300 above that to gain slightly slowly but with less fat gain, or ~500 to gain more quickly, but with a bit more fat gain.

You say your gym is ""heaviy lacking Barbells"", and I'm not really sure what that means.  Are there some barbells, or none?  If there are none, can you go to a better gym?  If not, is there a good selection of dumbbells and machines?  Also, you should look up the meaning of the word ""redundant"".

If you can wind up somewhere with barbells, that will be your best option simply because there are plenty of balanced barbell programs out there that aren't overly complex.  They'll be easy to stick to and will give you good results (provided you do them right [read: follow the program, and with proper form]).  Things like Starting Strength (see the sidebar) and Greyskull LP (I like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ADuFA.png) version) would be perfect programs to choose.  If you can't wind up somewhere with barbells, search here on /r/gainit and over at /r/fitness for balanced beginner dumbbell programs.  If none of that works for you, you can check out /r/bodyweightfitness.  Most of what they do only requires having some floorspace and a pullup bar.  Check out their FAQ.

Read the FAQ."

bored_criminologist,AskSocialScience,1389710406.0,"Well, I started as an intern doing basic admin work. I eventually helped plan the implementation of a new smoking ban. After implementation they needed people to be safety officers to enforce the new ban so when my internship ended I transitioned to that position. I took my job extremely seriously and was able to lobby for an expansion of duties after about a year or so. With the expansion I got to write some basic public order tickets and serve as the first responder to disturbances. In that role I walked a beat and would be the first on the scene for incidents in my area. For minor incidents I dealt with them myself by writing tickets and stuff, and for major incidents I hung back and kept my eyes on the scene to provide police with firsthand accounts of what I saw. Basically I became a community safety officer with limited police powers. I also volunteered for things like event security.  I got a big break when in the course of my duties I uncovered a small drug dealing operation that resulted 3 arrests and 2 convictions. After that incident I received another duty expansion and was moved to an office in investigations. In that role I reviewed video evidence of known incidents and served on surveillance details.  At this point I finished my bachelors and was moving on to my MA. The department decided to put me through a Reserve Police Officer program so I could be more deeply involved in investigations. I went through that and became something of a part time investigator in my department. Then while working on my MA I got involved in crime analysis and crime mapping. That was my last position where I was doing statistical work that helped the department determine how to allocate resources. 

So basically find some low level nonsworn work to do in a department. Work hard and it will not go unnoticed. Getting your foot in the door anyway you can will open a ton of doors in the future if make the right kind of impression."

It's going to suck afterwards, too, because once you're in that relationship, you will see that relationship as your gauge for how much of a man you are. And that is really fucked up.

'Mirrey' (Mirreina in feminine) is the way a 'naco' retail worker, bus driver, shoe cleaner or in general face-to-public worker would typically refer to the client. It's a contraction of ""Mi rey/reina"" (My king/queen) and it's used as a way to flatter them to make them buy more or get engaged in... social situations, with the one who said it. This is most common in the metropolitan area (DF, Mexico city, Puebla).

The second one you got it right. That's the perfect example of a stereotypical fresa. Both nacos and fresas have a TV character recognised as their ultimate form, if you're interested: the ultimate naco is ""El Vítor"" from (La Hora Pico, Televisa), and the Ultimate fresa would be a tie between Mia Colucci (Rebelde, Televisa) and Bárbara ""Barbie"" Basterrica (Amor en Custodia, TV Azteca).

ForgottenLore,askmath,1389710854.0,"Let's first check the expected order of magnitude of the solution. To do that, we multiply the tape thickness (denoted t) with the ratio between The Earth's circumference (40,075km) and the center-disc circumference (82mm, denoted o1), and we get about 22km (14 miles). So we predict the order of magnitude of the solution is going to be in the tens of kilometres.

On to the problem. You have to figure out what the diameter of the tape will be when the 100m (denoted L) are rolled on. You do that by rolling one layer at a time on the disk and adding that to the length of the tape until you use up all 100m. The equation would be:

    100m = L = o1 + (o1 + 2Pi*t) + (o1 + 2*2Pi*t) + (o1 + 3*2Pi*t) + ... + (o1 + n*2Pi*t)

Each factor in brackets is the added length of one layer and n is the number of layers. Considering

    1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = (n + 1) * n/2,
you get a quadratic formula for n. You solve it and get n=600. So you can wrap 100m of tape 600 times around the circumference o1.

From that you calculate the new circumference of the roll of tape (o2)

    o2 = 2Pi * r = 2Pi * (o1/2Pi + 600 * t) = 25cm.

That's about three times more than o1 (=8.2cm), so the end solution is about one third of our estimated 22km, and that is 7km."

abeyante,AskWomen,1389710942.0,"Hahahaha well, um, what do you mean you've ""spoken to women""? Do you mean you asked women you were sleeping with whether you should do that? If so, that reeks of a ""I don't really *want* to do this but I *know* it would be sexy, so should I?"" If you've spoken to women you're not sleeping with, the same thing still applies. It sounds like you don't genuinely want to do it. Plus, take the act out of context (ask a woman about this who isn't currently aroused) and the logical ""ew that's gross"" part of the brain is still in control. That's like asking dudes if they want to get rimmed and having them say ""that would be kinda gross,"" yet when they try it *in context* for the first time they love it.

Also, if you have to ask (as opposed to doing it because you love the taste of cunny) then it's clear to women that you're not *really* the kind of person who could pull it off. It's sexy because it's so genuine. My boyfriend did it the first time in a way that implied he just *had* to stop for a second to taste it... because it was so delicious. That first time, it wasn't for me. After he saw my reaction he does it for both of us now--he wants to taste me, and he knows there's an added plus because it turns me on even more. It's hot *because* it's gross. My vagina is something I've been trained to find gross my entire life, something I've been raised to find shameful, smelly, and in need of constant maintenance. The idea that there are men out there who genuinely love women--and all their parts--so much that they actually *want* to drink my juices is incredibly sexy, and one of the biggest confidence boosts.

But if a guy *had to ask*, I would never want him to do it. Because it would show that he wasn't 110% into it. I've been with guys who thought cunny was gross, or who weren't completely enthusiastic about the whole thing, they just wanted their dick wet. It's totally different. And I would never enjoy a guy like that doing this because I would know he was doing it for me, not because he really wanted to do it. It would be weird, and it would be gross.

It's the difference between a girl who thinks semen is nasty trying to grin and bear it, and a girl who LOVES cum and wants to eat every last drop, even licking her fingers. Now, combine that with a hypothetical cultural context where male genitalia is perceived to be abnormal, gross, ugly, messy, and unclean (which I know is hard to really make equal since our culture treats penises as funny, albeit normal and just kinda sweaty, whereas even the *word* vagina brings up a cultural shitstorm in most places).

It has to be IN CONTEXT, and it has to be GENUINE. Then, IMO, every single woman will gasp and adore it. The reactions might range from ""holy fucking shit that's so sexy"" to ""ew omg I can't believe he just did that WOW amazing,"" but yeah. If it's *real*, it's ""a generally good idea."""

I'm toying with the idea of buying a new camera, specifically because of the recent advances in camera technology - better noise control, more frames / second, and maybe, to a certain degree, some of the hacks I've seen.

My problem is that I can't find a good site with a definite overview of what's available.

I can pretty much guarantee you that if he will not use condoms so soon with you then he is willing to do the same with others as well... Unless you told him you just tested clean then he doesn't even have the excuse of trusting your word on this (which is dumb to do anyway....).

The rest of that time is free to obsess over leisure and indulge our carnal thoughts and desires - ie, the hormonal-driven biological urge to fuck (or be fucked by) someone.

You probably used about 14 lbs of honey if your gravity reading was, as I suspect, 1.101 (24° Bx).

Potential Alcohol for that reading is about 14% ABV.

Wyeast Sweet Mead claims to tolerate alcohol up to 11%. That said, I hear that Wyeast might lose steam partway through or power up to 15% alcohol, sugars and nutrient allowing.

My guess is that if fermentation doesn't stall out early, you end up with around 11-13% ABV mead. That's a final gravity of 1.010 -1.026. That should leave you with enough sweetness.

If it ferments drier than you'd like, you can stabilize and backsweeten with additional honey, if you so desire. Look up potassium sorbate and potassium metabisulfite - their use is well-documented. How to backsweeten is similarly well-documented.

Fermentation times vary wildly and depend on several factors. Temperature is probably the biggest, followed by nitrogen and micronutrient availability. Batch size can have a small affect as well. My fastest was a melomel in four days in a warm summer basement. My slowest was a high(ish) gravity low-nutrient traditional that took nearly two months to come to a complete stop.

I keep [my notes](https://drive.google.com/#folders/0B8EtZLPjiym_X0I0dmhXdmNKaVk) available for anyone to read. Some of them are from very early in my learning process, so they may come across as naive in places."

TheFarnell,Quebec,1389711478.0,"Autres bons trucs pour les attentes et les visites aux médecins:

* Sachez quels sont vos symptômes, depuis combien de temps ça dure, et soyez prêts à l'expliquer concrètement quand on vous le demande.  ""Ça file pas depuis un bout, j'pense que je suis malade"", ça vaut rien.  ""J'ai des maux de ventre pointus dans le bas de mon estomac quand je mange, et ça fait trois jours que c'est vraiment rendu pire,"" c'est pas mal plus utile.

* Si vous prenez des médicaments, ayez une liste complète, et assurez-vous de savoir ce qu'ils sont et pourquoi on vous les a prescrits ou pourquoi vous les prenez.  Encore mieux, amenez vos contenants de pilules.

* Sachez aussi votre propre historique médical complet.  Maladies passées, traitements reçus, noms des médecins et des hôpitaux ou cliniques, etc.  Oui, c'est votre responsabilité de savoir tout ça, pas celle de l'hôpital.  Un bon jour on aura peut-être un registre informatique à travers les hôpitaux, mais pour l'instant, ça n'existe pas.  Si vous voulez chialer contre ça, parlez-en à votre député, pas l'infirmière qui vous demande votre historique.

* Soyez prêts à vous répéter plusieurs fois à du personnel différent.  Même si vous avez tout expliqué à l'infirmière au triage, ça veut pas dire qu'elle a tout parfaitement noté dans les 3 minutes qu'elle a passée avec vous, et même si elle l'avait fait, les médecins doivent faire leur propre évaluation.

* Soyez 100% honnêtes avec votre consommation de drogues, d'alcool, et/ou de malbouffe.  Ne mentez pas non plus sur votre age, votre sexualité, votre historique familial (ceci inclus les maladies mentales diagnostiquées), votre emploi, et vos habitudes d’exercice et d'hygiène.  Vous êtes à l’hôpital, pas au poste de police et surtout pas à un 5 à 7 de rencontres.  Vous êtes couvert par la confidentialité, et je peux vous assurer que le personnel de l’hôpital traite régulièrement avec des gens bien pire que vous.

* Ne flirtez pas avec le personnel.  Non seulement ils/elles n'ont absolument pas le temps, dans 5 minutes, ils/elles vont vous poser toutes les questions ci-haut.  C'est pas winner.

* Si vous avez besoin de chialer, faites-le auprès des gens appropriés *après* votre visite.  Vous n'aimez pas les temps d'attente?  Parlez-en à votre député, pas à l'infirmier auxiliaire qui n'y peut absolument rien.

* N'exagérez pas vos symptômes pour passer plus vite.  Au meilleur, ça va terriblement faire chier tout le personnel une fois qu'ils réalisent que vous n'avez qu'une toux.  Au pire, ça va vous valoir une évaluation psychologique.

* Si vous allez avec des jeunes enfants, leur apporter un jeu style ""Game Boy"" ou autre du genre est une bonne idée.  De grâce, apportez-leur aussi des écouteurs, pour ne pas déranger les autres.

* Vous n'êtes pas là pour écouter la télé.  Chialez pas pour changer le poste.  Amenez-vous un livre, à la place."

digitalpencil,worldnews,1389711720.0,"They don't *have* to pay them for anything, they *do* pay to remain Firefox's default search provider.

The reasons are multi-faceted. Primarily, Mozilla renews the partnership regularly and there are more players in the search bowl than just Google. In 2011, Google agreed to triple their payment for a 3 year contract comprising $1 billion USD to Mozilla. They did this because Microsoft and Yahoo were also in contractual discussions with Moz and Google will do just about anything to ensure Bing fails in gaining further traction.

There are also some subtler reasons; funding an open-source 3rd party ensures that the browser vendor market remain competitive such that an IE monopoly like that of yesteryear fails to develop again. Doing so could stymie further development of the internet as it did previously, which would directly affect their bottom-line. Couple this this with the reality of anti-trust legislation and the fact that Google are directly coupling Chrome with hardware/software via Chrome OS/Android; the financial support of a direct competitor can help them falling into a legal foul.

Put short, they don't pay this money out of the goodness of their hearts but because it makes sound business sense. It doesn't necessarily make a return, but it does act as a cheap insurance policy against multiple factors which left unchecked, could severely damage Google. 1 billion dollars is nothing compared to the potential losses found through anti-trust payouts, increased market competition and a static development environment."
klabob,hockey,1389711722.0,"So that guy looked at capgeek and last week news and decided to write an article while knowing absolutely squat about the team, nice.

You'd hope a writer would know that the contract spree Tallon went on was to put people in place to be able to not rush the draft picks, something the Panthers historically have done, the Blueprint. The Panthers had dealt numerous players for picks at the deadline and needed to refill the roster. They still had to remain at the floor of the salary cap, so it would have been terrible to spend 8M on one guy and have only 26M to fill in 10 players.

The plan was to have a competitive team and wheel and deal pieces along the way to make place for rookies once they come of age. Imo, what this news of spending to the cap means is that they will try to go for two top free agent and that it allows Tallon to trade Kulikov for something other than a pick and a prospect.

And to the question of attracting players, you need to show you are willing to spend and do what it takes to win. Also, the no tax is a nice perk."

I think the hardest deck to play (on a competitive level) is chain burn, and to do well with it and not get wrecked games 2/3, the player needs to have a really good idea of the current metagame and intricate card economy understanding.

I see that you're a very giving person and that it might be time to re-evaluate that because you might find yourself stretched thin. One of the cruelest lessons life teaches us is that we simply can't help everyone and that's not our fault. This year, make sure you take some time for yourself. 

Remember, it's okay to say no sometimes. 

This is also a good time to practice receiving rather than giving. 

And finally, think about your decisions carefully this year and really think about the small details before making up your mind. I see several big decisions in your future, ones that you should definitely think through 100% before you make any choices. "

superior22,summonerschool,1389711813.0,"Just for the sake of it, to maintain all three (and four and five axes, for that matter) you have to keep running in a straight line. You won't be able to catch and throw all of them if you have to switch directions. They always have to land in front of you.

During a team fight this causes one major problem, you WILL face check the enemy front line. Unless you're hyper fed (which to be honest isn't impossible if you abuse the passive) and one-two shot everyone on the enemy team will end in your death. 

It is a *fun thing* to do with friends or some players you met during earlier games, but I wouldn't suggest it for normal/solo queue games with strangers because you'll throw many games just learning to maintain three axes, wasting their time. There's a reason why these three, four and five axe skirmishes are mostly YouTube highlights and not seen in pro streams and tournaments."
Simbablk,sex,1389711815.0,"So, NSA sex can be tricky if not well prepared for.  One thing to note is that it is always appropriate to ask about STI history.  In fact, as I posted in another thread, I typically suggest both parties getting tested and bringing the results to a meeting so that both parties know for sure what the other person has/doesn't have.  That way there is no guessing about it. 

Also, setting up some rules for engagement.  Know what you're willing to do and what you're willing to put up with.  

- Are you monogamous to each other sexually?  
- Can either of you still have sex with other people?  
- Are you using condoms?  
- Is the woman on birth control and condoms aren't going to be used (this should only be done if all STI tests are negative)?   
- Are there certain days/times I should **not** call you for sex (this is typical for people with minor children)?

Set up rules and know your role in their life at the moment.  For instance, the very first rule was one I set up with a FWB in college.  As a result, I chose to make myself available to her at ALL times if she needed sex to prevent her from needing to fuck another guy.  That meant, when she called me at 3am to fuck, I got up and got dressed, headed to her place, fucked her, put my clothes back on and went back to my place to sleep.  That was our rule of engagement and it worked well for us.  

Sometimes bringing up a NSA relationship is awkward.  One thing is knowing if the other person has some sexual feelings toward you - either they've been flirting or making sexual comments during conversation.  Pick up on these subtle and not so subtle hints as to who you should approach for a NSA relationship. 

And finally, have fun!  Enjoy it while you're in it.  It might end abruptly or it might go for a long time.  Just enjoy it.    "

I was on a night train coming into Berlin from Krakow. It was a cold September morning and, since it wasn't a sleeper, everyone in our car was a bit restless from a long night in regular seating. Many of us were very hung over and a group of Polish guys were still very much hammered, having apparently stayed up drinking the entire night in their compartment.

As we were coming into Berlin, our train suddenly stopped. After nearly an hour-long delay that only served to make us punchier, we saw a bunch of orange-coated workers amassed outside our train car. They were all looking up at the car next to ours pointing and asking each other questions. Most everyone in our car had pooled into the hallway, opening the windows to see what was going on better. The drunken Poles were having a blast, not caring about the delay one bit.

Then, the workers in the orange coats started standing at attention and clapping. Another worker was slowly climbing down the car in front of ours carrying something. Once he got to the ground, he held a completely charred squirrel up by its tail and slowly, solemnly walked towards the utility workers with it held up in front of him.

All hell broke loose in our cabin. People were bawling with laughter - Germans, Poles and tourists from around the world were all sharing a moment of pure hilarity after a long night followed by a long delay. One of the drunken Poles was waving a red rose out the window and the whole group of them were singing some sort of funerary dirge for the fallen squirrel.

Even 10 years later it's one of my favorite memories of people just trying to get somewhere brought together by the absurdity of a situation.

Random832,TumblrInAction,1389712078.0,"&gt; Getting banged by five guys during ovulation (especially since this is framed as a contest between a superior and an inferior mate) actually would increase the tendency for her to get fertilized by inferior mates, who by virtue of fertilization would very (very, very, very) likely completely lock out any other mate (include superior ones) for about a year, as opposed to faithfulness to a superior mate (until fertilization, of course).

Er, not if all four additional males are genetically ""superior"" (granting that this is a thing for the sake of the argument) to the one she would would be with otherwise.

Seriously, why *wouldn't* you eat 5+ portions every day?! Don't you realize that you are living in a God-damned fruit and veg paradise?

Anyway, to answer your questions.

1. For breakfast, I eat some sort of cereal or an omelette with a fruit (grapefruit, apple, or pear) for dessert. Then an apple as a mid-morning snack. For lunch, some fresh vegetables (maybe a tomato, half a cucumber and a couple radishes), some cooked vegetables (for example, eggplant and snow peas with rice) and a bit of meat/fish/chicken, plus a banana for dessert. For supper, a bowl of soup, bread and cheese, and some more fruit (maybe a couple apples, or an orange).

2. See above — it varied depending on what I buy, but usually includes tomatoes, cucumbers, apples, bananas, and grapefruit.

3. Fresh fruit and vegetables are delicious, of course I feel better after eating them!

4. I have the opposite trouble, eating too much. Too many apples or other sweet fruit leads to gaining fat.

5. I don't really pay attention to the official recommendations. I eat the way I eat because I can afford it, because I enjoy it, and because it provides me with the nutrients and calories I need."

impy695,solotravel,1389712102.0,"Talk to your boss and see if you can get any more time off instead. It sounds like they value you a lot and may be willing to budge on that 1 month to keep you. Maybe see if you can suggest a smaller pay raise in exchange for more time off. If you decide to go this route I suggest you read some tips on negotiating salary and negotiating in general and practice with someone first. For example, I actually got 6 months off my job and took a pay cut when I came back in exchange.

Another thing to consider is if you do get a pay raise you will make more money to take shorter trips in the future. I'm back at work now and that's my plan. With that said I can say the IDEA of traveling for 2 or 3 weeks at a time does not hold the same allure. Since I haven't actually taken one of those trips though (just got back a month and a half ago) the reality may be very different.

Finally, if you take their offer, you can always quit in the future. You're 22. I traveled at 25/26 and I don't think I missed out on anything because I traveled at 25 instead of 22. If after some time you do decide to go this route just be prepared to burn bridges and possibly feel a little guilty.

Get your wallet at dogecoin.com  Download your appropriate wallet, unzip it, start it up.  Go to the much receive tab and anyone of those (you can create more) addresses on there is the address to that specific wallet and people sending coins to that address send coins to you.  You can create multiple ones to track coins coming from different sources.  At the bottom it will say out of sync and something about N number of blocks remaining.  Let the program run (it will take a bit at the beginning because you're new) to sync with all the blocks.

Time to start paying attention and check your surroundings. Check your locks, your doors, your windows. Make sure you put a priority on protecting yourself and your loved ones. 

Check your relationships. Theft isn't always of material possessions, especially if you've had your head in the clouds. Make sure no one is taking advantage of you or draining you emotionally.

&gt;The above examples subtly show how a girl doesn't actually care for you; she only cares about what you can do for her

Clearly, any reciprocation or unselfishness in a relationship is poison and contradictory to all evolutionary logic of attraction. Don't become a women's pet dog, I definitely agree there but there's no harm in freeing yourself from a malicious policy of control to being a decent person in moderation. In moderation, I'd do simple things unthinkingly for male acquaintances even(like example, helping this guy take care of his daughter recently so he could study for his bar exam, I generally find kids annoying). 

I'm not from the west so I don't know how jaded you are or what kind of degenerate rehabilitation center you're running but this is not the kind of control women want. One can maintain frame while *enjoying* their relationship. I would definitely, absolutely never settle for a woman who would not show any willingness or motivation to please me, but at the same time, why does that standard not apply to me? Besides, I *want* her to do things for her as well. And there is nothing beta about this. 

At the end of the day, I want a LTR with a partner I can be *happy*, not a dog I have to constantly be conscious of.

Also, not that it needs to be spelled out, but I'm speaking *generally.* Woman are not homogeneous, but there seems to be a preference that crosses racial, political, and professional boundaries that women prefer taller men.

Now, do I believe that all women prefer taller men? No. My fiance is almost 6ft tall so I *know* it's not the case. Is it possible my situation is unique and an outlier, statistically speaking? Yes.

As /u/dhporter pointed out on his [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1v6uuo/how_do_hibernating_animals_survive_without/cepaf30), bears develop a fecal plug (something like a cork) to stop them from defecating. And they produce very little urine so they can go months without having to go.

Bears aren't the only animals who hibernate, though. Some actually wake up for a few moments during their hibernating periods to move around, stretch and urinate or defecate. Other types of animals just go while hibernating, but the amount expelled is very tiny."

That being said, a healthy outlet of emotion is very beneficial to all children, male or female. Letting a child express emotion gives them a chance to both get comfortable with the experience as well as learn proper handling of the emotion. Most people who take the ""men who show emotion are weak"" norm too far miss the point that over-restriction of emotion actually makes you less able to properly regulate it when it becomes overwhelming. 

Dr. Ryan McKelley gave a pretty interesting [TED Talk](http://youtu.be/LBdnjqEoiXA) about the importance of emotions and social connectedness in boys.

It varies somewhat by state.

Because it is a cultural norm, I don't believe that a lot of thought is placed on the subject. It's certainly not something that gets brought up in dinner conversation... well, not often.

Babies are born, the Doctor will ask the parents their preference, and then does the circumcision as a matter of simple routine and that is about the last it's thought of.

Is it bizarre... yes. Does it bother anyone, not many but some for sure. 

There's a decent amount of literature on the web beginning to address the topic, specifically in relation to it's usefulness in consideration of hygiene and or its affect on sexuality.

I've heard/read theoreticals about lost sensitivity due to the loss of foreskin and an opposing view, that says that circumsised men might be more sensitive, leading to premature ejaculation.

I have no idea about the reality of either.

* **MBLAQ's G.O** - G.O is hilarious while simultaneously being very sweet and maternal to the people who are close to him so I think it would be fun to see him being funny on the show as well as seeing the sweet side of him get some attention.

* **Infinite's Sungyeol** - I feel like Sungyeol is the most underrated member of Infinite. When I watched their variety shows and reality shows he was always my favorite because it always seemed like he just did what he wanted and didn't give any shits about [his image](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lkqporWnP81qfqlq0.gif).

* **VIXX's Hongbin** - I'm more of an N and Leo fangirl myself but after the Voodoo Doll promotions I'd love to see more of Hongbin. He pops in and out of VIXXTV sometimes but I think this show would give fans an opportunity to see a more personal side of him. I would also accept N, he's charismatic enough that it doesn't even matter who they pair him with, he'd make the best show out of it.

Riot focuses on a balanced game, and that mindset won't change. I think, in that sense, Ghostcrawler is a great addition to the team.

The primary reason we are going with the modern style for all of our new construction is that it is significantly cheaper than doing something like an old-style stone facade structure like you want. We aren't a rich school. Notre Dame is. They can afford to build like that. We can't.

Also, in my own opinion, that style is for a different kind of university. We are not the same as Yale or Harvard or Rice or Stanford, and never will be. That's not who we are. The building style reflects the character of the university.

And as far as the ""...the modern look will quickly expire..."" that you said, that style of design has been around for a LONG time. [Here's a building in Germany](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Bauhaus.JPG/800px-Bauhaus.JPG) that was built in 1925, yet looks like things we are building on campus today. The style itself has already proven it can stand the test of time. The design may not be a ""traditional"" university style, but we are hardly a traditional university. The ones who have buildings like that have long since celebrated their centennials or even bicentennials. "
Lionstrong,SubredditDrama,1389712762.0,"Of course it's poisonous to self confidence. The running gag in that sub seems to be to ""just have konfidunce"", but the reality is you *need* confidence to be where you want to be.

Now, is that easy? No. You can't just *will* confidence. When I joined that  sub, I honestly thought there would be at least some mild flirting between guys and girls who shared something in common. The fact that they both need to stand on a chair to reach something from the top shelf, or something along those lines. But there was none of that. Unfortunately, /r/tall doesn't help the guys in that sub's self confidence any. On that sub you have tall *and* short women fawning and flirting over the men over there. On /r/short though, there are no tall girls hitting on short guys or even giving them a compliment. 

On the internet people can feel free to say what they really think. When you have a lack of positive reinforcement from the opposite sex, in a forum where there are no roadblocks to inhibit and you are in fact *encouraged* to be a little flirty.... it's hard to convince yourself you *are* good enough.

The major change is that after the NC, you have to balance Workshops, Public Schools, and the Guilds.  

However, after that, Acoustics and Architecture (where my Tourism started picking up), are on the way to Scientific Theory, which I grabbed before Archaeology (dig sites are massively important).  Cultural AIs will grab a few of those, but you should be at the point to grab at least one of those Wonders. I grabbed Porcelain Tower and Hermitage only and still won.

I've tried to think up possible reasons, but I cant think of any. For example in the article, 'Emma' is cited as a name given to girls named after their grandmas. But the gap between Simon not exactly being uncommon is too great for that. Any explanations? Or is it just part of the phenomenon of old-fashioned names making a comeback in recent years?"

Different regions of the worlds have different growing conditions and different plant genetics and such, and these can produce a wide range of tastes and aromas in the finished product.

I think it's similar to the difference between pressed, bagged tea-sweepings and actual decent single-origin loose leaf tea.

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1389712839.0,"&gt;People didn't accuse the Crown of being ""big government,"" they accused it of being tyrannical or despotic. It was only later that American political philosophies began to link the size of government to its potential for despotism. When the founding fathers criticized what we would call ""big government"" today, it was more about its efficiency or lack thereof. In this context, the quote makes no sense.

To disagree slightly:

Jefferson was afraid of ""big government"" in a more modern sense, but in two very unmodern ways. The first was in the Ancient Greek critique of democracy sense, specifically something like Aristotle, where democracy works best when people literally don't have the time for it because they're too busy on their farms. The second is that fear of what big government would do, in the anti-federalism of him and people like Madison. It wasn't so generalized. They saw the writing on the wall about slavery. They knew that the more centralized power the sooner that power would step in to stop it.

So it's not that it's totally disparate from a modern sense, but it's more (transparently?) classist and racist. "

Part of a performance is moving on with a mistake like it never happened and the audience generally doesn't notice small ones.

[Here's an article from Cato that I think describes well the situation..](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/egypt-committing-economic-suicide)

I don't really think there is such hope for this region in the short-term, any change will have to take a lot of time.. I actually believe that the country is in for a yet another cycle of socialism and Islamism.

The actual reason Libertarians and Liberals (and anyone with socially progressive values, really) do not exist is Islam. Islam is the exact opposite of social liberalism.. It originally developed from a tribal society and keeps a lot of its' tribal values, and that's why women are really not seen as more than the property of their husbands, that it did not abolish slavery (That happened in the Middle East [thanks to Westeners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_views_on_slavery#19th_century_and_later)) among other things..

Egyptian Socialists are really socially moderate as much as Islam would allow them to be, Liberals are either eventually [state-forced into exile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasr_Abu_Zayd#), [voluntarily exiled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamed_Abdel-Samad) (when some Islamic scholar says they're an Apostate) or [assassinated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farag_Foda) a result of [Islam's apostasy law.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam)"

We had success! Somebody got the Dice-A-Roo avatar, /u/bitterred and I blasted bad guys in NQII, and one pet got read a whole bucket-o-books. I don't think I'm going to do it every week, because that would be fucking miserable, but I feel like I got a lot accomplished toward one of my goals and it was pretty nice suffering with others on the subreddit.

I was also on the receiving end of a lot of kindness on Neopets this week. My husband traded a Draik to someone who scooped up a pet I was pound-transferring (never again!) MONTHS ago and jerked me around about giving him back, promising to do so and then transferring to other accounts and never again responding to my neomails. He was just an avatar pet (fire Blumaroo) to the person, but the pet was special to me because all my pets are special to me. He's going to stay safe on one of /u/ERTW82's accounts from now on, and I've already sent over the NP and NC items he'll be wearing for his customization. Huzzah! My husband is really awesome and surprised me in a wonderful way!

In this week's PIFF, /u/Doctor_WhoDat shocked my ass off by [sending me a Brown Paint Brush](http://www.reddit.com/r/neopets/comments/1uvxm6/payitforwardfriday_31/cembt8s)  so I could paint [AlexBlooming](http://www.neopets.com/petlookup.phtml?pet=AlexBlooming) brown. He's so pretty now! I mean, he was always a good looking Kau, but he looks so nice in his final color! I'm so happy it's ridiculous.

Greece and Byzantine went Freedom and were in Civil Resistance / Revolutionary Wave for most of the game, but they had &gt;60 happiness so they didn't feel the affects.

 I chose Order because I wanted the bonus for having the same ideology as everyone else since the AI loves Order. I probably won't choose Order again, because it only really helped for Happiness. 

Yeah, i think Songhai going for so many wonders was a fluke. Greece not giving troubles was half luck and half distraction.  He played tall (only 3 cities), which is very unlike him, but I had him distracted in wars with other people most of the game that he wasn't a problem.

**Is there ANY detail** I could give you that would negate the fact that the person who has committed himself to loving you, loving your body, and being your ONLY sex partner dislikes fucking you? 

See....that ugly fat girl? She still wouldn't deserve to be treated like that. She still would be entitled to confusion and disgust at his horrible behavior and worse communication. When people, especially sex partners, do shitty things for inexplicable reasons the best solution is not to turn inward and look for some innate personal flaw. The only solution is to give that person a chance to talk it out with you and see if there's something to be done. If that fails, if he won't explain why fucking you makes him dry heave, then you leave that man and you don't look back. 

**Why am I yelling at you?** Because you have this so backwards that straightening it out might be super helpful and freeing for you. The only question I have is that why, after the first time you had to beg him for sex, did you not draw a line in the sand? Why did you stick around after you had to listen to him quasi-vomit? I don't care why he did these things, although I do admit I am curious. Maybe that's all you are here, too...curious. But I doubt it because when you start excusing away the fact that it wasn't anything wrong with you, I think you're a little more than curious and that is the wrong way to think about these things. You're going to occasionally draw a weirdo out of the deck and you have to separate their unacceptable behavior from your own body and self. There is NOTHING that could be ""wrong"" with you to excuse this. 

We're never going to know. We simply can't. There's no way of explaining this reaction, this level of assholery, this level of callousness and poor communication. But I think it does, at least in part, explain some of your personal pain that you could look at behavior this wild and unacceptable and attribute it to you. What is the weight at which it is okay to hate sleeping with someone you SIGNED UP to sleep with?
How gross would you have to be before your self-esteem was so shattered that you'd hang with a guy who treated you like that because it was only fair?

A lot of rich people don't understand it either.  IMO the poor are often better at budgeting than the rich are because they constantly have to do it.

&gt;it ensure that their kids get taken care of instead of the parent(s) taking all of the money.

It ensures no such thing.

&gt;it ensures that the people have enough $$ to afford the basic necessities.

So would a negative income tax.

&gt;this is where i lose you. where are they going to invest it? who's going to tell them where to invest it? do you know how much that costs? i studied finance in college. you know what i got out of it in terms of investing? the safest investment is investing in index funds and everything else is a mess. the stock market earns on average around 7% a year. thats not going to help poor people out of poverty much faster (especially since the real return is more like 5% after taxes). investing should be lower on the list of needs.

Depends on where they invest it.  A poor person could have purchased some stock in a startup like Apple in the 1970s and they'd be loaded today.  The point is that they ought to have the freedom to do so. 

&gt;the problem is that a lot of people got into poverty b/c they didn't know how to properly spend their money. at least welfare programs teach you: this is about how much you should spend on food, this is about how much you should spend on insurance, this is about how much you should spend on housing. even middle class people aren't the brightest in how they spend their money (see: the housing crisis of 2008). i think the govt can at least provide people with a road map on how to spend $$ on necessities.

That doesn't teach people how to spend $ on necessities.  That's literally just telling them what they can and can't spend their money on.  It teaches them nothing.  Giving them direct cash would teach them how to budget more efficiently.

If people in other classes don't know how to budget, then why are you singling out the poor for the govt to teach them how to budget?"

jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1389713690.0,"&gt; So, what can I do to fix myself?

Realizing you need the help is the first step.  Therapy is probably the best option but not the only option.  Self-help books and/or online blogs might be cheaper options as well as freebie support group meetings (something similar to AA meetings in concept) if there are any around you.

You realizing that your wife doesn't mean to be mean/controlling is a big part of stopping it.  I'm opposite you in that I keep all my emotions/anger inside so while that usually keeps me from snapping back in anger at the time it can lead to other problems.  Fortunately I've been able to channel my bottled up anger into more analytical thoughts trying to figure out if their criticisms were correct or not.  I'm sorry, that's not very helpful.

I'm also with you on the perfectionist part of things.  Everything I do has to be 100% correct and even then I still feel it's 'not good enough'.  Took many years to tone that down to more livable levels.

Our healing is a long work in progress.  All you can do is try to improve a little bit every day.  Good luck and get professional help if you can afford it."

I'm in the same boat as you are, I have a higher drive than my SO and it's caused us some problems in the past. When I was first given the above advice I asked her if she felt loved and what I did to make her feel that way, she said 'yes' and then listed off the things that I'd do for her (cook dinner, hang out with her, hold her, take her out, pack lunches, take care of the car, blah blah blah) and I thought ""well, then what's wrong?"" Little did I know that what she really desired was deep conversation. She wanted to sit and talk about how we feel or debate a topic or go over anything that would make her seriously think. 

Just recently I spent a whole day just sitting there talking to her about everything that's been happening to me over the last few months, what I've been thinking/feeling, what I want. And then we discussed whatever was making headlines that day, ripping into the topic and just talking. The sex that night was amazing. The quickies that we've been having were forgotten, this was a long, passionate, love making that left us both satisfied. Needless to say that I repeated the process the next day.

Sadly she is now back in Grad School, and living one state over, so I won't be able to report on my success or failure on maintaining this, but my tip to you is to make him feel loved. But don't take his word, take note of his actions. What does he value most in a relationship/friendship? What can you do to provide that for him? And if you do so, will he return the favor by making you feel loved with physical intimacy?"

People who are shot many times have the bullet pass through or have it lodged somewhere in the body, and many people who actually commit gun crime use either a smaller caliber (which can actually bounce around inside the body under the right conditions but if they pass through don't do too much damage) and/or they are not using hollow-point bullets which expand on impact and are also way more expensive than full metal jacket. It's also really hard to actually shoot someone unless you're right next to them. Think a drive by shooting: they always got the little kid next door and not anyone they probably wanted to kill. When someone stand someone else it is usually a crime of passion and there is more fury behind it, not that there wasn't here with this guy shooting the man in the theater but honestly he was probably tackled to the ground after the first or second shot. 

This is a really basic explanation and some of it is conjecture (ie caliber used in gun crime and lack of hollow points and why) but that would be my guess. Also I'm on my phone so please excuse the crappy formatting."

Ching_chong_parsnip,sweden,1389713941.0,"Snabb sammanfattning efter att ha skummat domskälen i uppsåtsfrågan, som alltså gjorde att mannen friades:

1 - TT (den tilltalade) har berättat att han varit övertygad om att MÄ (målsäganden) samtyckt till alla handlingar, eftersom:

- MÄ lämnat samtycke till sex

- De hade tidigare pratat om okonventionellt sex, och TTfick indikation på att MÄ ville ha ""hårt"" sex genom att MÄ tagit hans TT:s och pressat den mycket hårt mot sitt underliv, samt att TT även fått fortlöpande gensvar under tiden de hade sex

- TT fick vid ett flertal tillfällen tydliga protester från MÄ, kroppsliga och verbala, som ledde till att han omedelbart avbröt vad han då höll på med och återgick till de handlingar som han uppfattade att MÄ samtyckte till. 

- De tydliga protesterna gjorde att TT uppfattade lågmälda användande av ""nej"" och ""sluta"" som en del av det sexuella spelet som innefattas i dominanssex.

- TT stämde fortlöpande av, kroppsligen och verbalt, med MÄ att hon samtyckte till det som hände. MÄ styrde bl.a. tillbaka hans penis mot hennes slida när han hamnat utanför. MÄ nickade även åt TT på hans fråga om det var okej.

2 - Ett vittne som pratat med MÄ har berättat att MÄ berättat för henne om vad som hänt, och att MÄ hållt med henne om att det varit ett stort missförstånd från TT:s sida, vilket MÄ även sagt till polisen.

EDIT: TT:s berättelse, som vinner stöd av vittnets och i viss mån även av MÄ:s uppgifter, gör att det inte är ställt utom rimligt tvivel att TT haft uppsåt till att med våld tvinga MÄ till samlag.

Nope, instead many seem to almost exclusively talk to others when things *aren't* going well.

Basing advice on a relationship solely on the bitch sessions isn't realistic. There is good on one side and bad on the other when it comes to every relationship scale.

If people can work through things, become better people to each other and learn to communicate better even dickish things/events *can* be overcome."

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389713980.0,"i'll chime in because you seem curious to learn about various INTP self-images and frankly i consider myself to be the most interesting person i know... not for any real attributes, but simply because my own experience is the only thing i can truly KNOW personally.  it has nothing to do with my superior-interestingness, it has everything to do with the fact that i'm stuck in this body and it's the only way i can navigate reality.  nobody thinks about anybody else more than themselves (thoughts are inherently self-centric) so i'm not going to pretend i'm bored with me.  if that were true living at all would be utterly and completely pointless.

on the topics of self love, self hate, self transformation, and behavioral causes, however, i don't know how to discuss without coming off completely inauthentically zen-pollyanna.  i believe that loving literally everything is a necessary condition of loving the self, thus self love and self hate are challenging to reconcile.  i also don't truly believe in free will which complicates the notion of self transformation and behavioral causes.

but given the confines of others' socially imposed restrictions upon me, i enjoy that i can write rather well and i don't enjoy that this skill has tempted me to 'coast' through aspects of life.  i enjoy that i fit a certain description of physically beautiful and i don't enjoy that my skin gets pimples, and my arms are disproportionately thick.  i enjoy that i can see many things others cannot, and i don't enjoy that this perspective can be alienating.

i do my best to try and accept everything and to try and change everything.  my presence in the universe determines that the universe will inherently unfold very differently than it would without my presence.  at the same time i recognize that the only thing in life i can ""control"" is my own behavior choices, which are all inevitably shaped by external forces."

devonclaire,weddingplanning,1389714004.0,"I kept a list in my kitchen of supplies/tools I would like to replace (or acquire) to add to my registry. Anytime I made a recipe that said to use a tool I didn't have, I would add that tool to my list. (So, food processor, serving platter, meat thermometer, etc.) Or, anytime I looked at an existing item and knew it needed replacing (gunky old spatula, etc.), I added it to the list. This was how I came up with what we needed to register for. I did the same for bathroom items, like new towels and washcloths. 

This might sound silly, but if you feel you don't have room for the items you want to register for, I would think about making room for them. Your wedding is one of the only occasions in your life where people *want* to buy you shit to make your life better, and I wouldn't pass that chance up. Maybe you have room underneath your bed, or in the top of a closet, to store a few larger items (i.e. countertop appliances) until you move into a bigger place where you can use them?  

Having said that, keep in mind that a lot of people will just give you gift cards, so you may not have to worry about not having enough space. In addition, you could always register for the items you want, and if you don't end up having room for some of the gifts, then you can return them to the store in exchange for a gift card equal to the cost of the item. Save the gift cards until you move into a bigger place, and then use them.

In short, I say register for what you want instead of what you think you have space for, because if you can't fit some of the gifts in your house, you can return them and get a gift card instead. In addition, I was surprised at how many items we didn't end up receiving — and it was fine with me. Presents weren't very important; I was just glad people came to my wedding."

If you don't like it, you can not go, or be firm it telling those around you what you're comfortable with.

A family fair? Totally unacceptable. The sexual implications are completely absent in a venue like this, and it should be kept that way."

BurningLed,DotA2,1389714095.0,"Don't discount the extra nuke you get in comparison -- level 1 and 2 bolas are 80, 120 damage, but level 3 is 240, and 4 is 300 -- at level 6 with 3-0-2-1 build, you can literally just 3x R, Q, E, and deal a total of 300+240+(40x3)= 660 damage purely off of your spells in the time they're rooted (i.e. totally unable to escape excepting a few specific root-allowed mobility abilities), as well as another autoattack that almost makes up for the one extra autoattack you get from the 1 you'd have in W (and just one-- it has a 30 second CDat one). In comparison, a 1-1-3-1 build deals 80+(70ish+30)+(50x2)+300 = 590 damage in that time, down 70 damage -- and your W has a 30 second cooldown at 1, while your Q has 10 seconds in the other build, 14 in this one. The extra time on your E can make up for it, but I find the extra disable time and CD reduction on your Q more consistent. The only situation in which I go the 1-1-4-1 build is when the increased magic block is necessary to keep them from popping my shield, causing me to lose the damage from it and/or killing me (e.g. if I were against a mid like Skywrath, which is actually an incredibly shitty matchup any way you slice it thanks to his silence).

The only other thing early W has going for it is W-Q combo, but for the most part your ult will do you fine until mid-late game, when it's a teamfight, rather than a gank, and you can't afford to ult into the enemy lest you get cc'd and blown up. That said, it definitely has application if you're sidelaning and want to go for pre-6 kills."

I think DmC actually has some of the best depth to its gameplay out of the entire series so far. With a combination of the angel pull and devil pull, you can spend entire skirmishes in the air, and they have a great spread of monsters that require unique strategies to dispatch.

DMC4 is probably still my favorite installment, though. Those boss fights..."

Right, I never wanted to argue that Nietzsche himself wanted to go out and kill people, only that in some cases his philosophy might not forbid it, which I think people are hesitant to read into him.

Scarlet-Ladder,dataisbeautiful,1389714139.0,"The trouble is that the same amount of money's worth is different depending on where you are. For example, in Australia the minimum wage is a lot higher than say, the USA. However, the cost of living is much higher too, especially for what are deemed 'non-essentials'. I know many people having to choose whether to eat or pay rent on time by the time payday rolls around. By American standards we earn a lot, but the cost of living adds up too. I'm not saying 'Oh, woe is me - I live in the poorest country in the world', but you can't compare wages without looking at the cost of living too.

Also, I find it hard to believe that every single area of Western Europe, Canada and the USA is blue. There are incredibly poor areas in all these countries. Why aren't they shown?"

You can probably work more than 30 hours per week.

What really makes being poor expensive is lack of contingency, lack of options and the resulting credit card debt whenever something unexpected happens, which makes it impossible to catch up. This can happen to almost anyone if they don't have an emergency fund. The trick is to not do something stupid, like buying a car, early on.

Sir_Fancy_Pants,AdviceAnimals,1389714161.0,"well without giving away too much personal information, I am now in a position where my opinion, influence and reasoned arguments carry more weight and significance than ""Mr and Mrs public"" to those that hold the ""keys to the kingdom""  (senior government)

the public are better served by me ensuring I openly and fairly expose myself to the truth no matter how uncomfortable and unfriendly it may be, and this can only be achieved by an objective evidence based process.

Unlike most people i try and consider something based on its principle and validity and not its emotional impact on a minority.

People are not generally rational and objective assessors, and so when discussing policy or process which govern and influence everyone, you cannot unfairly weight extreme emotion or impact of individuals against the majorities.

of course there are moral and  ethical issues where this does indeed come into play. but i genuinely believe gender identity is not one of them.

People often forget that for us to be free and to enjoy our liberty we must allow people to make their own choices and live their lives how they see fit (within reason obviously). naturally one would expect to see different leanings and trends amongst career choices and fields of expertise between the sexes, because truthfully i do not believe gender is an entirely societal construct, we have evolutionary hard wired leanings and preferences to our conduct and our behaviour, and these naturally have advantages and disadvantages in certain fields.

provided as a matter of policy and process, that anyone is not restricted in their choice to  follow or choose a path they wish to follow, I have no issue or wish to enforce or amend a quota or agenda of representation for gender by field or path.

or put more simply, provided there are no specific restrictions or processes that disallow anyone of any gender taking up any career path they wish, their actually personal struggle or journey of that path is not something that can be legislated or policed by an external force (government or any other agency)

I must say its nice to chat to someone who is worth speaking to, most of the Reddit comments and submissions are total garbage devoid of any merit, but you are a refreshing breath of fresh air.

hezec,MapPorn,1389714194.0,"Namibia is an odd one. The country is mostly empty desert and huge cattle ranches outside the northern part where most people live, plus a few European-founded towns including the rapidly growing capital Windhoek in the middle of the country. On average it's the most sparsely populated country in the world after Mongolia, with only a little over 2 million people. The economy is based mostly on mining diamonds and uranium, plus some nature tourism. De Beers Namibia, aka Namdeb, provides something like 80% of the tax revenues of the entire country. As this would suggest, the income disparities are *enormous*. The taxes do get used for relatively good basic education, healthcare and infrastructure, but sadly HIV and unemployment are still major issues.

Politically the situation is also a bit unique. It is a democratic country, but the former independence front SWAPO (Namibia only gained full independence in 1990) is still seemingly very popular and holds about 3/4 of power in the government -- there have never been implications of election fraud anyway, as far as I know. They were good friends with communist leaders (for instance, I believe there is still a Fidel Castro Street in Windhoek), which wasn't appreciated by everybody although their politics have never been particularly communist themselves.

I suppose the press is relatively free to do what they want; it's just that straying too far from the widely accepted ""party line"" probably won't get you many readers and even fewer actual results, so nobody really bothers to try, nor would the government care.

PatHeist,worldnews,1389714211.0,"What the fuck? These people don't deserve to die. It's a company - companies exist to earn money. A company with shareholders and a board of directors can and will only end up making decisions that seem like they would make more money, regardless of other consequences. No one person or no specific group of people made the decision to chop the forest down. It was a situation of everyone doing their job. In order to get companies to abide by 'moral rules' you have to make those things law, and fine companies enough to stop it from being a good business decision regardless.

It's the same thing with minimum wages. It doesn't actually cost a company significantly more to up the wages of their minimum wage employees by 50% in most cases, and it wouldn't actually make your burgers more expensive (until wages going up means that more people would be willing to pay more for a burger the price the burgers are currently at is still going to be the price they'll earn the most money at). The issue is that nobody in the company can make the decision to up those wages without convincing the shareholders that that'd be a good idea. And they can't, so it doesn't happen until minimum wage is made higher by law.

**EDIT 1:** Well, it seems no one here knows how publicly traded companies work... Let's just hang people who do their job, instead of holding a government that fails to regulate and keep track of companies responsible! That'll solve everything!

Europe: As an American we are led to believe that Europe (or pretty much anywhere else in the world) is inferior to the US. Holy shit that couldn't be further from the truth. My first trip was shocking to say the least. However I have learned that the following stereotypes are true. Europeans are healthier and happier. Their infrastructures are far superior to ours. They embrace green technology and in general are more advanced as a society than we are. And while the youth are always a contributing factor to the throw-away culture, it is far less prevalent in Europe. They expect shit to last.

Mexico: I understand why so many leave the country to come to the US, it's simply for lack of work in Mexico. However there is something to be said about these people because once they have saved enough greenbacks they all want to go back to Mexico to retire. The country is beautiful and has many wonderful cities and villages. One of the stereotypes I found to be untrue is that all water in Mexico is tainted. That is simply untrue and there are many cities and towns in which the water is just as safe to drink as here in the US (West Virginia excluded currently). Also, there are a lot of wealthy people in Mexico and they are almost always from Spanish descent and are taller and appear to be completely Caucasian.

From my first step father I have learned that pretending to be a person the other person wants you to be can't last long and eventually the house of Lies will fall apart, so try to look for someone you are actually compatible with, not someone you think you could be compatible with. 

From my second step father I have learned that we all make mistakes, but life is about overcoming difficulties and putting needs and wants in front of yours, especially when it comes to family members. As in difficult situations those will be the people that will come to back you up, treat others like you want to be treated.

irishguy42,asoiaf,1389714396.0,"1) Well, in AGOT, Tywin tells Tyrion that Varys' whispers that Stannis was bringing Melisandre from Asshai to Dragonstone. So, maybe a better question is: ""Why did Stannis bring her to Westeros, in his service?"" We know that once the two of them met each other, she immediately believed him to be AA and destined to beat the Great Other. But then we're still back to the question of why Stannis went there in the first place. But I see that GRRM says the opposite, that she went to him. Or, when GRRM says that she went to him on her own, does he mean that when Stannis came over, for whatever reasons he had, she willingly went to him/with him?

3) I don't recall, but did Mel see Renly's death in the flames? We learn from her POV that she does misinterpret things from time to time. So wouldn't it make sense that if she did see this death in the flames, maybe she misinterpreted that it had to be Renly that needed to die? She then starts down a mislead path that she needs to offer Stannis a way for Renly to die. If she didn't see this in her flames...well...I got nothing. Either way, she is complicate. She provided the means to do it, and she was willing to do it.

I think Stannis is somewhat, because he just wanted Renly out of the way and dead. He saw Renly as a traitor to the crown (his crown by right) and wanted him dealt with. Mel offered him a way to do it. Stannis didn't care how it was done, but he went through with her help anyway, and then forgot about it.

4) Mel is definitely meant to be a POV at the wall. Why? Well, I imagine something big is going to go down eventually with the Others, and it only makes sense for her to be there, as a priestess for the R'hllor, the opposition to them. I have no comment on her resurrecting Jon Snow. Part of me just doesn't see it happening.

6) She will be an asset against the Others, even if it's just inspiration and her visions. I don't honestly believe she will see Stannis again in ASOIAF. Stannis will never make it back to the Wall. She will be too consumed with the Queen's men, the NW, and the prospect of the Others coming. She also intrigued by seeing Jon in the flames. Also, her powers are greater at the Wall. What this means for the future, I haven't the slightest."

That's a generalized blanket statement, and I disagree with it in general.  Anytime I've compared the original, dynamic mastering of an album I love to a modern, compressed master, the dynamic mastering has always sounded better.  Sure, the compressed master has the initial WOW factor because it's louder, but when you level match them, the dynamic one almost always sounds better.  

Ruining the dynamics just for that initial WOW factor is just cheesy, but I guess it makes sense if you want your music to sound good on cheap low powered equipment like iPhones and laptop speakers, because more dynamics require more power.  But that seems like an extremely unprofessional thing to do."

tinkyXIII,TumblrInAction,1389714577.0,"I've known exactly one SJW personally in my life. Met her via mutual friend in 2012 and she seemed pretty cool at the time. Claimed she was trans-whatever which honestly I give two shits about either way, which looking back she reacted slightly odd toward. Like she was expecting an adverse reaction or something.

Anyway, I didn't know what tumblr was even about so I thought we just had similar interests out of luck (certain cartoons and shows, Homestuck, etc.), but as time went on I found she didn't really know much about shows she claimed to like outside of Supernatural. No big deal, she could just be a new fan. To a dozen series.

In the span of about a year she didn't really seem that off-putting to me. She even introduced me to my future fiance and even helped get us together. Then the plan was hatched for us to all move in together. It was a totally mutual thing and on paper made sense: Two of us already had income, and when little miss covert-SJW moved we could pick up the slack until she got a job. That is, until she couldn't wait and wanted to move in earlier than expected. Still okay at this point. Only I was living in a tiny apartment and there was no room. She insisted that was fine.

Oh boy, here we go.

The first problem I had was when I tried to watch Game of Thrones season 3. I waited until it was done to watch it all at once, but apparently the show was just ""far too triggering"" for her. I wear headphones when at my computer, mind you. I ask her if she'd seen it, but no, she'd heard enough from (wait for it...) tumblr. Fine, you don't have to watch me watch it, but I am going to watch it. Which led to her cranking the (thankfully pitiful) speakers on her netbook and play the same song on repeat. That became a constant thing, mind you.

Slowly things like that escalated with her. She had to be the center of attention at all times, which I wouldn't give her much of mine because I was (and am) madly in love. She saw this as the perfect opportunity to try and sabotage things with my girlfriend. She was ""dangerous"" and ""unstable"" in her words. This coming from the same person that was in hysterics for an hour after a random guy said hello to her on the street. I made the mistake of telling her one day she's going to draw attention to herself because she stuffs her massive tits into small tops in the summer and walks around a town known for partying and festivals like Kneivel Days. People stare. She screamed for five minutes before I tuned her out. Honestly, people stare at me when I wear anything but black around here.

I can't remember when she said it, but she was on some ranting spree and ended it by telling me I should check my (straight, white) privilege one night. I couldn't take it anymore and just went off on her and shot down any supposed arguement she had. Oh yes, growing up in the south in the 80s and being schizophrenic and poor really give me *so much* privilege. I hadn't really objected to much she has spewed until now, but everything that had built up just came out. To be honest I felt bad about it after, and almost apologized.

She eventually got a job (where everyone was against her, apparently) and quit that before getting a job in the medical field. I've heard she's still in town, and honestly would love to run into her again with my fiance (who also has beef with her), just to show her what being happy looks like.

We are definitely at a cross roads. For my standard to be challenged, I would say that there would have to be definitive proof that fetuses have brain activity at any given point in gestation. On top of that, I'm not sure what you could do to convince me that personhood is not a prerequisite for human rights. I simply don't think that a non-thinking, non-feeling entity should be afforded the same rights as one that does. As an example, I wouldn't let a fully functioning human suffer while a brain dead human was living comfortably - if it was in my power and the switch could better the functioning human.

Since this isn't the case, at least insofar as we know, then I'm inclined to believe that fetuses acquire personhood rights after the first trimester, and that's typically where I would cut off the permissiveness of abortion."

The real issue with putting valuable items in with everything else (aside from theft) is that a lot of the people purchasing them will be people intending to resell them. It's pretty common for people to go into a thrift store, buy everything with a brand name, and put it on eBay."

&gt;A lot of people seem to have the misconception that a birth certificate is solely a record of medical history. This is like saying your driver's license is exclusively used for the purpose of driving. Both items are identification documents used (and required) for MANY other purposes. So here's why this matters to transgender folks: It creates a conflict between identifications. So a birth certificate could say male, but the person's driver's license, passport, and social security could all say female. Now if this person is required to show their birth certificate in a job setting, they would instantly ""outed"" and also at risk for being fired (for ""lying"" on their job application). Or an even more idiotic/ironic issue is marriages. In states with gay marriage bans, it would be legal for a trans woman and cis female to be married. But it would be illegal for a trans woman to marry a man (based on the genders of the birth certificates)."

ShamelesslyPlugged,40krpg,1389714688.0,"The problem is with a sandbox the goals kind of get made up on the spot. I can see a few: 1) Escape; 2) Plunder; 3) Screw the Imperium.  

So, you'll want to dangle things in front of them to guide the narrative. Planetary governor is rumored to have a stash of archeotech. PDF is sympathetic to the whispers of Chaos. Smashing innocent farmers just because. Space port with 1-2 warp capable ships or merchants, also some perhaps interesting goods there. Small astropath outpost to summon some raiders (once the nids arrive, this option is no longer available). Beating on the genestealer cults just because.  

Basically, sounds like you let them stomp around for a bit either gaining stuff, trying to take over the world, or getting out of there. In the process of that stomping, they run into the cult with the same goals. If you're feeling ambitious, DH-style acolytes show up. If they leave the world early, have the ship they take get infiltrated by the genestealer cult. Otherwise, they're caught in the middle of the Nid invasion. At that point, they will likely run - unless they've conquered enough of the world to try to make a stand.  

If they run, you can do an awesome chase scene to the starport with apocalyptic set pieces and the occasional fight. Then either they fight off boarders as they escape, or if they have the right skills you can do piloting and shooting to fight other ships. I'd oversimplify it as opposed to doing Rogue Trader (although that's an option). If they stay and fight, you'll have to figure out a campaign system."

clairebones,TwoXChromosomes,1389714742.0,"Just interjecting to this thread because of your comments on forgetfulness, hope that's ok.

My SO has ADHD, which mean I have to be strategic about asking for help around the house. Schedules don't work and reminders don't work, because he does know that the things need done. He just has trouble doing them, because he gets distracted so easily. Even if he's standing in front of a note or a list of things to do, he just won't do it because something else will come up in his head first. But at the same time I know he isn't lazy, because he does get frustrated with himself if he realises I've done a bunch of chores without him helping.

Usually what we do is that I wait for a time when he isn't busy, and then I ask him to help me with something *right at that moment*. Reminders, and requests of ""Can you do this at some point tonight"" just don't work because he honestly won't get a moment in his brain when that pops up. SO we agree that when something needs done, and I ask at the right time, he does it right then and we can both relax. It does feel bad at first because you do feel like you're nagging, but it has worked out better for both of us in the end."

Did I ever say this is exclusive to tall people or is something all tall people think? No. I gave my input on why you shouldn't use such a line. In the discussion we were having about comebacks to height remarks. In fact I specifically said that what such an attitude stems from is not a trait unique to tall folks quote, unquote (for EMPHASIS) ""not at all"". And then I heavily, although apparently not thickly enough, implied -- in closing my remarks with it will be ""hit or miss"" -- that it may or may not work. It could go either way.

Reason-and-rhyme,summonerschool,1389714783.0,"The way you should build Lux mid is completely dependent on a) your matchup and b) how well you carry out the laning phase. One of the biggest choices you make on Lux is whether to run Lich Bane or not. The pro of it is, it stacks incredibly with your passive and makes you a really fearsome midgame duelist. Your max damage combo is already Q &gt; Toss E &gt; AA &gt; Detonate E &gt; AA &gt; [then if they're still not dead and running away] R &gt; AA. You can see how this already incorporates 3 spellblade activations, and if you're really quick you can get off an AA between the Q and E toss, meaning you proc the passive 4 times. 

So that's a lot of damage and if you get ahead in lane absolutely take this route, it will allow you to burst anyone except the full tanks after you poke them a bit with your outrageously long range poke.

But if you fall behind, getting off those Lich Bane procs will put you in a dangerous place. Lux's AA range is nothing special and she's quite squishy naturally. So I would recommend building it if you go up two or three kills in lane and you aren't particularly scared of enemy bruisers. This is mostly a mid game item, however, and in teamfights you'll usually be engaging at a much larger range. Not that it won't still be useful for cleanups. 

Matchups that I suggest Lich Bane against: Katarina (this is a no brainer as she'll be popping up within AA range whether you want her to or not, and you have no way to disable death lotus besides killing her), Fizz, Zed, maybe Gragas, Akali... Mostly melee attackers who will try to play aggressively to protect their ability to farm. Start building Sheen early against these guys, switch to your CDR/regen core (morello or Athene's most likely) if you start falling behind as most melee mids have huge burst potential if they get just a few kills. If that's the case then you'll want more regen to be able to poke them to the point that they don't want to go all in against you. 

Aside from that I agree with the suggested build, Athene's is strong against long range mages similar to yourself (other lux's, Ziggs, Ahri, Veigar, Ryze, etc). The main advantage you have over most of those champs is spell range, and a shield. But you're going to have to be casting often so I usually go first item Chalice in those matchups.

Basically, learn to balance poke and all in, based on your matchup. You can win trades at almost any engage range *as long as you can convince your opponent not to go all in*. Shielding preemptively can help.


Support lux is... Well she only really fits in a kill lane. The shield helps win trades but you have literally no sustain, if the enemy lane has a Sona, Soraka, Nidalee... You'll be pulling your hair out because you wasted all your mana winning damage trades that they just heal up within a minute.

Obviously go Spellthief's since you'll be trying to land AAs anyways. After that it's up to you how hardcore of a support build you go. Usually I still build full AP, maybe a Sightstone if the team bitches about vision a lot. Talisman has a much more useful active lategame so it might be worth selling your Spellthief's or Frostfang later on.

Lux is a fun, medium skillcap champion that fits pretty well into most team comps due to her combination of utility and extremely ranged damage. Well worth learning if you play mid a lot."

Then make sure that none of his medications have a side effect of lowering sex drive. After that, have a blood work up done to see if it's anything medical.

I agree with the Q-W build if you want to play Ember in a sidelane, because you won't be able to get the level advantage necessary to make the Q-E build (which I more or less always take in mid) effective, but this is because Q-W allows you be more effective in a lane in exchange for kill potential (because you can repeatedly W people with the 6s cd until they're forced to back off or die), but this is if you want to safelane farm and rush that battlefury -- generally a poor plan; I usually stack battlefuries in pubs (though I agree that against top-tier players, you will get more out of something like bottle, drums, deso, mael, crit) but I acquire them by taking mid lane, getting fast levels, then running around killing people nonstop with his 600+ unavoidable damage at level 6 (with a 3-0-2-1 build, 3x R, Q, and E). 

You will actually get your battlefuries slower (both because farm does still generate more gold than kills, and because you'll want something like phase+bottle first), but that's okay because you're shooting for its W synergy and split-push strength (you're great at split pushing because you can drop a remnant at side shop and get to rax, then instantly jump away), rather than farm acceleration (though that helps too)."

Chrozon,hearthstone,1389715158.0,"A bit late reply since I was at school. Sure the mage spells were nice but you don't know what my neutrals were, which were loaded with crap like raid leader, windfury harpy, lord of the arena, frost elemental, and generally loads of neutrals that do not go well with mage.

A mage without AoE or decent draw potential falls behind so fast. That mage run I lost to a warlock who opened turn one with 2x wisp + Abusive sergeant, because I couldn't deal with it fast enough to not die.

Sure the spells are good, but most of the spells trade 1 for 1, you can't get a 2 for 1 with a fireball, frostbolt or polymorph, those spells are effective to keep board control, which is hard to do when you don't even have it.

So the only games that I actually were able to be in a strong position were the games where I was able to safely get out my one auctioneer, and defend it, which isn't easy, and were maybe 2-3 games. The rest of the games I had to stall crazy and hope I top decked Deathwing, I literally kept him in my mulligans because he was my only chance of victory. That's also why counterspell was so important, so I could protect it from hex and such. Still even with Deathwing I had to bait him to play everything he had so that when I played him he couldn't just flood the board and win cause I can only deal with 1 target each turn.

So saying my deck was great because of a few decent mage spells and a slightly above average legendary is not really correct, and when I first drafted the deck I was even doubting I'd go over 7.

I'm not really sure what point I was trying to make earlier though. I'm totally for nerfing flamestrike in arena, since it's ridiculously effective. I guess I was just trying to make a point that it's possible to get +7 without OP spells, as long as you analyze your deck and figure out what strengths it has, and how to play it correctly.

TL;DR: My deck wasn't that great."

Also, if you do get that Boston gig, you are in a pretty sweet location.

ironic_mustache_ride,chicago,1389715224.0,"I'd love to see some positive solution for the mental health services that were discontinued in Chicago within the last few years. 

More services like Thresholds http://www.thresholds.org/about/ or Heartland Alliance http://www.heartlandalliance.org

would be a great thing. I love how comprehensive their services are. Unfortunately, these types of services have wait lists, are severely underfunded, and cannot meet the demand for their services. 

The closure of multiple psych health centers in Chicago has left a vacuum that I hope can be filled before people end up in jail, dead, etc. 

Also I would like to add that the people who work for these organizations for a living make so little money. It amazes me that the typical social services worker has an advanced degree, and possibly multiple certifications, licenses, etc....but get paid so poorly. And it takes mighty balls of steel to do some of the work they do. One in particular, Assertive Community Therapy, social workers go out into the field and engage chronically homeless people in the hopes of getting them into some type of housing, assessing their needs for medical/psych care, etc. How many people would go into tens of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt so they can make shit money while trying to engage homeless people in conversation?

There really isn't much of a ""procedure"" to put it in, long syringe with lidocaine, shot straight to the arm and all you feel next is just... pressure. There are no incisions with a scalpel or anything like that, the implant is in a bigger syringe (smaller than a straw) that get's ""injected"" in there. Heals in 1-2 weeks and there is really no pain around there. You also have to go when you're ON your period, but I lied and said I was when I wasn't and I don't think it made a difference.

I can feel it, make it pop out a bit if I flex, press on it so the sides show, all in order to freak people out.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1389715545.0,"HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! 

**Clears throat** - Buddy, I worked at one hotel for 4 months, and another for about 6. In 10 months time I had honestly seen some shit;

**Hotel One** - This hotel was the ""premiere"" hotel in my town. How I don't know. But I had to help out with laundry one day and there were fucking stained sheets everywhere and bedding. Greasy pillow cases, blood stains on everything, and bathrobes with skid marks. And this hotel that was demanding damn hundreds and hundreds of dollars a night and couldn't even be bothered to replace old bedding. Oh no, and the cheapest rooms this hotel had to offer didn't even have bathrooms.

OH, HELL NO. 

You got the ""European Experience""! You got to share a common bathroom in the middle of the damned hall and because of that I remember at one time professional cleaning crews had to come in and super clean the carpets because this one gentleman was so excited about his ""European Experience"" - that he shit himself with joy! He left a fucking trail of *SHIT* from his room... to the broom closet that was a bathroom. Yeah, the other people were thrilled at having to go either up or downstairs to take a piss.

The kitchen was another hot mess. Constantly failing inspections, but managed to somehow stay open, I think it was because people were paying $30 for a plate on average. It wasn't even ""real"" food. These cheapskates ordered all their shit from Sysco and were marking shit up to cost 10 times as much. 

**Second Hotel** - This one was more tame. IT was a Marriott so the policies were strict, so the only crazy that happened was there the guests:

I remember an abusive woman who's husband was in a wheel chair and her son had down syndrome. All the boy did was cry, which was unnerving because he was in what looked like his 30's and husband you could tell would end it all if only he had a gun. But this WOMAN was so loud and obnoxious and just generally abusive the cops were called on her twice in a week - but the cops didn't know what to do because no other hotel had room to take her and they didn't want to displace a mentally handicapped man. The only person she liked was me. Why I don't fucking know... but I became the token person to go deal with her if things got crazy. 

The other story was how a bunch of parents and kids came along for a hockey tournament. The kids were awesome, the parents were shitheads. I remember my mother calling me (she worked nights, I worked mornings) to tell me that the kids had hidden themselves in their rooms (most likely going to bed), and the adults managed to fill the dining room with alcohol. 

The adults got more and more wild to the point the parking lot she claimed was filled with cruisers. I was told it had became a brother, boxing, pissing, and drinking match all in one and some folks spent the night in jail while the kids (Ok, teenagers actually) got to be babysat by the local P.D. 

The clean up the next day was fun. "
heres_a_llama,Christianity,1389715545.0,"All the time! In my case, I converted. I am not a Jew in their eyes because the rabbis who sat on my beit din and the education I received from my sponsoring rabbi and community do not meet their muster. 

But, if we're working from some view that I am suddenly considered a Jew in their eyes, then I also do other things that would be wrong in their eyes, because I seek out an egalitarian community.

Thankfully, though these really big differences exist between us, I strive to respect them, and 99.99% strive to respect me.

I am one of three non-Orthodox women in the SF East Bay area, for example, that keeps the family purity laws. This means that prior to resuming intimacy with my husband, I have to immerse in the mikvah, and someone has to observe me doing so. This could be another woman who had to go that night, for example, or someone trained to be a ""mikvah lady."" 

I told the mikvah lady (the rabbi's wife, the rebbetzin) who organizes the immersions for the community that I wouldn't feel comfortable putting the other (Orthodox) woman in that situation. I'm not a Jew in her eyes, I can't serve as a witness, and I wouldn't want her to be put in the position of having to either stay quiet and do something against her religious principles to be polite for my sake, or be forced to ""embarass me"" by saying she didn't want me as a witness.

I guess the only time I get really upset is when they not only tell me that I'm wrong, but they do so in a way that states that ""if only"" I would receive ""proper"" education, that I would ""clearly"" make the same choices they would. It's insulting and infuriating."

gyrorobo,motorcycles,1389715713.0,"$1250 seems a little bit overpriced unless, but not too much if it has been very well treated. 54k km is a lot of distance especially on a dual sport. It shouldn't be *too* bad if it was properly maintained (top end replaced with that mileage hopefully)... But I can't say for sure, I'm not a mechanic.

I purchased my 2000 KTM 400 EXC for $1350 (&lt; 5000 Miles) and all she needed was a new battery, fork seals, and a cleaned carb. I got lucky and also bought at the end of the season though, along with the guy being a genuinely very nice fellow. He was getting older so he didn't ride much and wanted to see it get some new life since it hadn't been run in 6+ years. [Picture because I love this bike](http://i.imgur.com/6AhbOtg.jpg)

That being said, 2 strokes make awesome little bikes that you can still ride even after you've gone to bigger badder things. I learned on my KX and I still have her around. Plus they're great for learning bike maintenance because replacing and repairing things are usually easier and more frequent which means lots of practice!

Edit: Honestly though anything that looks well and runs well will do just fine. It's your first beginner enduro bike and it'll be fun no matter what it is. Buy it an learn now, upgrade to something you truly want if you find joy in offroad!

Tavarish,Games,1389715723.0,"The Wolf Among Us S01E01 was released on 11th of October, 2013. Today is 14th of January, 2014. It has been three months since release of first episode, just like OP has stated.

We have no ETA, no release date, for S01E02. Just that we may get more information about possible date at some point of January. Lets assume E02 comes out by end of January it means they still have three [3] episodes after that to release.

On Steam it says *""Episode 1 Available Now, Episodes 2-5 will be released periodically until Summer 2014""* which to me means that all episodes will be out by end of May / mid-June. Which means 4 to 4.5 months to deliver three last episodes. **If** E02 comes out by end of January.

Either TellTale steps up their game and stops fucking around and can produce one episode per month, but something tells me that estimated schedule wont hold up. That last episode will come around ~1 year mark of E01 release. If they mess up delivery of TWAU it will eat up a lot of goodwill that gamers have towards them and if they mess up TWD S02 delivery I think it will kill all goodwill.

Don't get me wrong, I don't want TellTale to fail. I'm just afraid that they really are spreading themselves thin and/or messing around with project priorities which in return has hurt development of TWAU. In future I will step back from TellTale products and wait that ~1 year after which purchase whole season of X.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1389715764.0,"Well, in my mother's case, it's her name on the title for the house. All the cars are in her name, she has the best credit score, and she's the breadwinner. She's retired, my step-father still works most days and comes home in the evening, so my younger half brother would be awarded to her care. 

She stays in an unhappy marriage with my step-father because they are just a few years shy of 60. They don't have the motivation to start over. They own the nicest house on the lake, they have the nicest cars for their upper middle-class income group, and they don't want to lose any of that. My mother would get everything in the divorce but have to pay alimony and would be overburdened with caring for the youngest (middle school puberty is rough). Realistically, it's not too difficult but it would mean forgoing on the usual 2 vacations per year. No one, I mean NO ONE, wants to stop going on vacations.

On a side note there are some doubts wether or not my step-father is cut out for living alone. Some nights he might believe himself capable; however, from an outsider's perspective there is no chance of success.  For instance, he has not paid bills or taken the financial reigns from my mother in 20-something years. The apartment/bachelor living situation is very expensive in the area. It would eat his paycheck. He hasn't cooked (except for Sunday pancakes) a proper dinner in YEARS. He would be living off of take-out and Hungry Man microwavable dinners. Most importantly, there would be no one around to schedule his doctor appointments so he'd be behind on his health.  

I think it would be more reasonable if they have extra-marital affairs rather than divorce. But they don't look for companionship outside the marriage - I find that sad. Their incompatibility and dislike for each other is all they have in a lonely marriage for two. I wish they found happiness before it's too late, I certainly wouldn't judge them for it.

megawompwomp,AskWomen,1389715899.0,"My boyfriend and I met on OkCupid (and from the looks of this thread, we aren't the only ones!). A year ago today (yes, I remember the dates), he sent me a brief message and I replied. A few words turned into a few sentences which turned into a few paragraphs. During the messages, I mentioned a sushi place that I enjoyed, and we decided to meet there after a few days of back-and-forth.

The man who met me at that sushi restaurant was handsome and charming. There was an absolute ease in our conversation - I had never been on a date with someone who ""clicked"" so effortlessly. When the restaurant closed, we went to a local bar and stayed there until it, too, closed, sharing a few drinks and continuing the conversation. After 6 hours, we ended the date with a kiss and a promise of another.

We continued to date, eventually deciding that we both wanted something more serious. Going out once a week turned into a twice a week, which turned into a few days a week. We talked every night - neither of us really enjoy phone conversations, so this was out of character. We met families and friends, went on vacation together, and started to plan a future. 

We decided late last year that we should move in together. Part of me wondered if it was too soon and feared failure, but something just felt right, especially when I would hear him say ""let's go home."" 

We celebrate our one year anniversary this weekend. If you told me a year ago today that I'd fall in love with the man who messaged me that afternoon and that a year later we'd be in the process of taking the next step toward starting a life together, I would have laughed in your face.

heres_a_llama,Christianity,1389716031.0,"&gt;Wait, which rituals are those? I'd just assumed that the priestly offices left along with the Temple.

For example, each Shabbat, we read a section of Torah, broken down into seven sections. We call a person to bless the reading of that section. First always goes to a Kohen, second always goes to a Levi, the rest go to Yisrael. 

&gt;Do y'all believe in reincarnation, or is that mostly only found among Orthodox Jews? 

Are you referring to the Thirteenth Principle that /u/namer98 posted yesterday? If so, it is one of the three principles that I cannot say 100% ""I believe with perfect faith"" to, and thus didn't feel comfortable asking Orthodox to convert me. If it could be understood metaphorically, I'd probably be okay. But I've always heard that it has to be understand literally, and thus I can't say Ani ma'anim to it...

&gt;What's the general approach among Conservative and Reformed Jews to Kabbalah and other mystical traditions?

I'm not a particularly spiritual, fluffy, mystical person, so it doesn't appeal to me. There are some lessons to be learned from it though, so I wouldn't say that it's to be ignored either...

&gt;One of my high school instructors was a Conservative Jew who went to an Orthodox synagogue (presumably for lack of other options in the area). Do any of you do this? Does the opposite ever happen?

I have lived in areas without Conservative synagogues. At the time (about 5-7 years ago...) I went to the Reform. I couldn't do that anymore. Orthodox wouldn't accept me as a member of their community without another conversion. I'm not sure what I'd do, to be honest.  I can't imagine an Orthodox would feel comfortable in my synagogue because it is egalitarian.

&gt;Are you allowed to enter churches? I recall namer saying he wasn't.

I will go to a church if my friend or family member is being married or buried. My family is more important to me - shalom bayit.

IntellegentIdiot,bestof,1389716071.0,"Your points might have been valid in the 90's but certainly not recently. On the face of it, it might seem like a reasonable suggestion to just get a better job and it may work for some people but on the whole jobs are finite. If a company doesn't need someone to do a well paying job, they're not going to employ someone. All the well paying jobs are pretty much taken until someone leaves. Even if all the people on low or minimum wage took the time and effort to improve themselves there would still be the same number of positions. It would increase competition for new vacancies but ultimately almost all of those people would have to keep their existing jobs.

The solution is to create more jobs at that sort of pay level and you do that by creating demand for the product those companies make or services they provide. To pick the first jobs from your list, demand for plumbers, electricians and carpenters would rise if there was a demand for construction, which would rise if everyone else had more money. If you increase the wages of the people at the bottom of the chain it creates demand that can be satisfied by those further up."

abeyante,AskWomen,1389716102.0,"&gt; We've all concluded that they have a mild form of autism (or something similar) that was just never diagnosed. I really don't think what was done was carried out with malicious intent.

I'm an autistic woman, and I want to tell you that this right here makes me absolutely sick. Please, PLEASE don't feel like you can't do anything, or can't cut contact with them, or whatever, because they're autistic. For one thing, autism has nothing to do with whether or not there's malicious intent behind abuse or assault... Also, a great number of sexual abuse cases have nothing to do with malicious intent. That has zero baring on what happened here. *It doesn't matter if they didn't understand the problem with what they were doing*, all that matters is that it happened, and that you really shouldn't ever have to interact with that person again. 

I know plenty of autistic people with no comprehension of cause and effect, or of theory-of-mind/learned empathy. I know a few sociopathic autistics who don't understand the pain they inflict on people around them. When they do horrible things *they are blamed for them* just like everyone else. If anything, it's worse, because this demonstrates that they really should be taught these things, and instead of getting the proper reaction (""holy shit so-and-so did something *really fucked up* we should teach him why that was wrong/put him in a program/get him some help"") the problems are being brushed under the rug because of some strange avoidance or fear of...what, exactly?

Why do you still have to interact with this person? Can you just say: hey, it doesn't matter why they did what they did, or whether or not they understand it was wrong, this person is damaging to me and upsetting to be around. Even if you don't ""blame"" them, it can't be exactly fun and games to have to be close to them still. You shouldn't have to interact with your abuser because they're autistic... I really don't understand this."
