KneeDeepThought,cringepics,1389290594.0,"Old folks are the biggest trolls on the planet. Your basic troll is just someone doing whatever crappy thing they feel like and using anonymity to escape consequences. Old folks almost never face consequences for any socially reprehensible act, so they take advantage and treat people like crap to their face whenever it suits them. No one's going to cold-cock an old lady for ""accidentally"" spilling hot coffee all over you or calling you every name they can think of because they don't like the way you look. Seniors are like trolls who don't need to hide behind anonymity anymore and can brazenly screw people over all the time with no penalty.

There isn't any clear teaching i got this from, but I'm sure that Christianity reinforced my feeling that intimacy had to be coupled with 'true love', whatever that was.

I love sex, but I hate it too because I want it and but feel bad that I do...

crazy personal story: My 2nd partner was just a one time thing with a girl I had crushed on for years but I was so adamant about 'respecting' her that we had sex and I never actually looked at her privates because I was afraid she'd think I didn't care about her if I didn't look only at her face, like if I looked at her body it meant I saw her as just a body.

Yea, I was messed up back then, and the shadows are always there.  Took willful practice to overcome some of this crap.

The real kickers were two things:

1. There's virtually zero support online for the RMX2, and minimal support for the RMX. I can solve things on my own for the most part when I have good online support (just googling stuff), but in this case I couldn't find a single instance where anyone was complaining about the same problem I had.

2. When I opened up DJuced, it sounded like crap and the buttons still weren't working 100% accurately. The headphone cue was just playing the mix louder over both the speakers and the headphone (and no I was not plugged into monitor). The audio sounded crackly, too. I know it's not my songs because I had played these in Traktor before and never had an output issue like that. It sounded like clipping, but even when I turned the volume down it wasn't fixing anything. 

The combination of there being minimal online support, failing to agree with traktor, and being underwhelming when I got it to work in DJuced, combined with the amount of effort it would take for me to switch DJ software made it an easy choice to pack it up and return it to Amazon. "

I would say it's best to make sure whoever you date is clear on what your role was in the military. Make sure they know you were in combat--if you told me this I don't think I'd ever straight up ask you, ""Did you kill anyone?"" because it doesn't really make a difference to me. Some women will want to know, and I think the earlier they know this the better.

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389291022.0,"Well when the whole thing started, she made it clear to us that we were the bad guys for being white men. I suppose she wanted us to feel like a minority or something. She'd do little games which visually set us apart from the class, subtly pinning us as the enemy. For instance, one game was where she'd ask about things, and every time you answer yes, you take a step forward or backward. The questions were things like, ""Has anyone ever used a slur against you. If so, step back."", ""have you ever taken a vacation out of the country, if so, step forward."", or ""did your parents buy your first car? If so step forward."" Now, granted, I know I'm lightly privileged, and it's not something I like to showcase to the world. I try to be fucking humble about it. But she is the one that forced me and my buddy to let everyone know. 

At that point, we realized that there was no point trying to apologetic. She intentionally tried to point us out and force some sort of white/male guilt on us -- which we wouldn't take. She wanted us to ""realize we were bad people"" or some shit. So instead of taking her route, we went with our own unapologetic douche route -- after all, she was a douche first, so we'd just return the favor. 

Initially some short haired lesbian and some fat chick (both white, mind you -- the minorities were surprisingly in agreement with us. It was the white chicks who had an issue.) would try to argue with us. But they eventually realized it was a useless effort since we were basically just trying to troll at that point. So there wasn't much reaction by this time other than, ""Yeah, those are just the douchey white guys,"" type of reaction. What made it kind of interesting is we sort of became the leaders of the classroom. Everytime a question was raised, they'd expect a response from us, in which case, we'd just play into our character that she created which was douchey white rich males. Our answers were always stereotypical which I believe sort of lead the class discussion. So I suppose it wasn't too bad.

NotAPimecone,AskMen,1389291259.0,"My BMI is pretty high, my BMI is over 30 and classifies me as obese. I do consider myself overweight but BMI is a poor indicator as it doesn't take into account anything else about the structure of your body - percentage and distribution of fat/bone/muscle, whether you have a broad or slim build, etc. 

I'm healthy and active (lots of work around the house and yard, regularly commute to work on a bicycle), have excellent blood pressure (in the ""optimal"" range when tested recently), and have no indications of diabetes (SO is diabetic, used Her kit to test). Most people, if asked to guess my weight, underestimate by 50 pounds or more. 

My SO and I have gone onto the DASH diet - currently on day 5 of the initial phase which is sort of like a ""cleanse"" - bread, fruit, and starch are more or less eliminated and the meal plans result in approximately 1200 calories per day. This is more for Her than for me - it would be good for me to lose weight and while I am ok with my body now, I will be even happier when it is leaner and healthier, but She needs to for health reasons (she weighs about the same as me but is shorter, and diabetic), and it's not really possible for just one of us to go on a strict diet while the other is eating whatever they feel like.

naveedx983,AskMen,1389291277.0,"As someone who is just left their twenties a few months ago here is what I would tell myself from 10 years ago:

* Take care of yourself, you didn't pay much attention to your fitness in your teens, and it gets harder to maintain or lose as you get older.  Form good working out habits now, they'll do a lot for you beyond just staying in shape.

* Don't be afraid of things, when something makes you nervous tackle it head on, the feeling you get for overcoming that fear is amazing, and it builds on top of things.

* Don't be so self conscious, people enjoy genuine people, and if you're always worried about looking dumb or saying the wrong thing, people won't be as open to connect with you

* Grow a backbone, if you like her ask her out, if she says no don't hold it against her,  move on.  There are too many women out there who are awesome to get hung up on one that doesn't like you back.

* Save some money when you can, life throws curveballs at you, your ability to handle these situations well can keep you from a painful cycle of loans and credit card debts.

* Don't take shit from people, stand up for yourself"

They also weren't very popular outside of Paris, and indeed, there was comparatively little unrest in the rest of the country in support/imitation of the Commune, even in the big cities (Lyon being kind of an exception, IIRC).

I think the ""charm"" of the Commune is that it's like a ""pocket revolution"". Not a lot of people, very limited time span, etc. It makes for fascinating observation while being a whole lot less complex than the events of 1789."

shadow1515,Fitness,1389291572.0,"&gt; Its almost like your body goes through withdrawal when you don't get them.

I'm actually really surprised I wasn't able to much solid research on this with a brief search. The word endorphin is a portmanteau of ""endogenous morphine"", and as might be expected endorphins are thus known to be useful in mitigating various types of pain, improving mood, and other things people typically abuse opioid drugs for. Nevertheless, I [can't find much](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22endorphin+withdrawal%22) about withdrawal or discontinuation syndrome associated with endorphins specifically. It could be that there are mechanisms in place to prevent physical dependence on endogenous opioid compounds, leaving us with only a psychological addiction to them."
WraithPDX,worldnews,1389291572.0,"US National Cemeteries don't have *convicted* war criminals. Yet some of the interred have very bad, controversial histories. For example, Gen. John DeWitt is interred in Arlington and he was responsible for the illegal internment of Japanese Americans. Lt. Col. Frank A. Barker is interred in Arlington and likely on the Vietnam Memorial and he was one of the higher-ups who was actively and directly involved in the My Lai Massacre. He was KIA before the investigation started. These are just two, further investigation would probably turn up many, many more.

I'm not saying US national cemeteries are direct comparisons to Yasukuni, but the internment of some of the individuals is comparable and can be just as controversial to some.

I've not heard how Yasukuni portrays them as a victim of WW2. Can you elaborate? I need some context to go with this before I can really comment on it. I could see them arguing that they were acting in a way to benefit all of Asia and that would make sense with some of their views of the time. Outside of the atrocities committed by the IJA, I could see them arguing that what they were doing was no different than the US and Great Britain at the time, and I've heard those arguments more than a few times. But I don't imagine they are saying ""Look, Nanking was an outright lie and no killings occurred!"" like some of the batshit crazy right-wingers over there seem to think. 

I also don't think it's fair to compare Shinto to something like Christianity. Nearly everything in Japan has a kami associated with it. It's less about worship of those dead than it is paying respects for their sacrifice and service for Japan as a whole. Also, were all shinto shrines privatized after the abolishment of State Shinto? The wiki specifically says that Yasukuni was privatized after the war, but I can't find any sources that suggest any others were as well, such as the Atsuta or Ise Shrines."

NomadicScribe,TrueChristian,1389291648.0,"I think that Ken Ham will probably win, or at least, whatever words are exchanged will be construed as a victory. It isn't just because of the ""[pigeon chess](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pigeon%20chess)"" idea, but because of Ham's vantage point: his ideas are non-disprovable and rely on a combination of faith, selective evidence gathering, and some imaginative speculation. I'm not saying he will change Bill Nye's mind, but neither will Ken Ham's mind be changed, and he'll be able to fall back on his faith that many of the large unknowns in the universe have already been solved. He will simply conclude by declaring that Bill Nye's heart has been closed to God's love, and say that he will pray for Nye's salvation.

Furthermore, I'm not sure who will be editing the video of the debate, but if it's anything like Ray Comfort's ""Evolution vs God"", you can bet that it will be edited to Ken Ham's advantage.

I think, overall, the increased attention for AiG could be a good thing for evolution advocates. At first, it will make Bill Nye look bad: he went up against the world's most prominent Young Earth advocate, and couldn't change anyone's mind. But later, the subject will be given much closer scrutiny, by a much larger pool of people. Instead of being dismissed as some obscure religious faction, the Young Earth Creationists will have their claims tested more seriously. In my opinion, this will make them look far worse than they ever have, because no amount of testable evidence will ever support their claim.

It won't just stop at the academic level: even if Ken Ham releases a heavily edited version of the debate on DVD, YouTubers and bloggers will pick it apart mercilessly, just like they have done with Ray Comfort. 

In the end, truth does not have an agenda, and no amount of debating or political maneuvering will make the Young Earth hypothesis true. Better to get it out and get it overwith, than for the Young Earthers to carry on for another few decades insisting they are an oppressed minority. "

feedmahfish,askscience,1389291715.0,"Fish are poikilotherms, meaning they are ectothermic and do not have mechanisms to maintain body temperature.  It simply is what the outside is.  

Physiologically speaking, that means the energy demands of the fish change with the environment.  At higher temperatures, they need to eat more to get more energy for growth and reproduction.  Why?  Because physiological processes such as respiration, enzyme binding, and cellular growth/production occur faster at higher temperatures (a basic lesson in chemistry right there).

At colder temperatures, these processes slow down because physiological demands decrease with temperature.  Thus, a fish is respiring less, it is moving a lot less, it is eating a lot less.  These fish will have good survivability in that low temperature climate.  Putting a fish in cold water is a good way to lightly anesthetize fish in that you are getting them cold to the point where you can tip them over with your finger (it's actually quite fun).

Fish can die at too low temperatures or too hot temperatures because of protein denaturation, altering physiological demands causing stress, and potency of water quality variables (like ammonia toxicity).  But, they can survive at low temps (relatively speaking), or warmer temps for a while if the energy demands are met while in that altered temperature state.

Missionary was never that easy for us, usually we had to use a pillow or some other leverage to make it really pleasurable for the both of us.

First of all, learn what sturdy furniture lines up perfectly with her sitting on it and you standing; or for that matter with her on her hands on knees and you standing behind her. I figured out that my kitchen counter and my current bed are perfect for the former and my childhood bed(don't ask) is perfect for the latter.

Try doggie style with your GF on her belly and a pillow under her hips, that worked perfectly for me and I could get really deep; ended up being my favorite positions.

A position we really got in towards the end of our relationship (I don't know what the technical name is sorry) was having my ex lay on her side, me straddling her ""bottom"" leg and wrapping her top around my Torso. Gets you really deep, you can use the leg wrapped around you for thrusting leverage and you still have a free hand to molest/tease/grab whatever you like.

Reverse cow-girl is always a good one too.

What others have said, pillows, wedges, really anything you can think of. I found this stepping stool that was just the right height for standing sex once, the problem we found on our third go round though is its way too easy to get caught up and knock your partner off.

At least half the people I know think they NEED money to have any chance at a decent relationship. Being at uni, that kind of misconception is everywhere. Of course this doesn't come up much in conversation, people just assume that you also feel the same way. I know a few people that are aiming for high paid jobs for the reason of women. But they would never admit it publicly (not quite sure why they told me tbh), they just say they want a comfortable lifestyle and so want the money.

As for looks and height, that can manifest in many different ways and is so common that it's kind of ""normal"" to be slightly insecure about it. So much that you may not even realise anything is wrong as they aren't acting unusual. Do you know anyone that takes ages to get ready? anyone obsessed with a certain part of their body? hair is the most common in males I've noticed, that and of course muscles. 

Recently a guy I live with had a girl over and begged me to move his drying underwear to my room so she didn't see them... Normally he's a really confident guy, but obviously there is a fair bit of insecurity under the surface.

Reduced GDP is irrelevant if there are no jobs for some people in the first place. If a person doesn't have a job in the first place, how do they reduce GDP? I believe the previous recession of 2008 created a permanent job loss in the US. Many people are out of unemployment compensation, and are now faking disability to get SSI. Now add in Obamacare, which further reduces jobs, especially in low profit margin areas like fast food. McDonalds and other fast food places have to reduce workers, and hours for workers cannot go above 32 hours per week so the business does not have to pay for medical insurance. Medical insurance is a HUGE expense.

No, out of the studies I've read, many seemed tinged with fear, rather than facts.

I was also bullied for my weight, called fat on a daily basis, even though I was as skinny as a stick :( I developed crippling self-esteem issues and social anxiety and couldn't get out of my house for *more than a year*. He knows this, my whole family does. I still think I'm ugly and fat.

The worst part is that he was encouraged to keep doing it. His friends and random people(since he has 5000 Facebook ""friends"") laughed about it and congratulated him on the bullying(literally saying things like ""omg you're so mean to bully her lol""). An uncle told him nicely that it was disrespectful and mean. I told him politely that what he was doing was wrong and offered him some advice. But instead it's like ""lol if you're so butthurt about it THEN DON'T LIKE"".

Quick edit: Also he posted the girl's Facebook name... and because he has so many ""friends"" it's possible that she might get some mean messages too. It's horrible."

hermithome,AskHistorians,1389292022.0,"&gt;This is only a technicality. If you expose 4 people, and kill them, then expose 4 more. The total number exposed is 8. But 4 are dead. Expose 12, with 8 dead and the total number of exposures that be counted as able to expose so to speak, is still only 4. 

Actually, it's not just that. Selecting someone for Sonderkommando doesn't automatically expose them to everything. To the fact that people are being gassed in the showers? Yeah, they get exposed to that quickly but things like chinks and weaknesses in the system take time to discover. So if you rotate the guards regularly, you are exposing less people, not more. Not only does the current number of people in that position stay the same (dead men don't tell tales), but if you kill them quickly, they don't live long enough to learn weaknesses.

Also, not only is Kapo not perfectly analogous with 'bad apple', but that's phychologically very different. The sense of power that they had is crucially important, and unlike punishing other prisoners, or giving certain prisoners more 'cushy' jobs, or an extra piece of bread, there is no power or control to be had in cleaning up dead bodies.

Tri-Polar,sex,1389292060.0,"To point one: Not necessarily.  While some women may not enjoy it as much, quite a few definitely do.  Men aren't always more sexual.  I believe I have a higher sex drive than my boyfriend does.

To point two: Having likes and dislikes is normal, and so is telling your partner what you want.  I wouldn't say that on it's own is a red flag.

To point four: This would really be more a matter of opinion.  If you're okay with looking at and posting sexual things online and she is judgmental about it, I could see it causing an issue or two.  Not a red flag if it's something you agree on, but if you disagree she might judge you for thinking it's okay, so possibly a problem.

That being said, it does sound like something is up and she's using this as an excuse.  It is possible she's always had a problem with it and was pretending not to, but if that was the case most people would've come clean sooner.  You mentioned that you travel for work sometimes, and you said she's been having trouble finishing for 4-5 months, were you on a trip for work 4-5 months ago?  From the sound of it you're still trying to make her stay and I advise against it.  Even if you do talk her into staying, you won't be happy.  You'll wonder why she wanted to leave, if you're really satisfying her.  You'll be paranoid that she'll do something like this again.  You're hurt and confused, you've been together for such a long time and you don't want to let go.  Holding on is only going to hurt you more.  The best thing to do is let go.  Don't keep asking her to stay, don't try telling yourself she'll decide to come back.  It hurts, but moving on is for the best sometimes.  If you work through this you'll always have a doubt in your mind, this was enough to make her want to leave once, it's not something changeable, what if she wants to leave again?  It's hard to be happy after that."

Clearly someone on a bike cannot very easily impeded a vehicle. However, if I was on foot (after parking my car, which is what I was about to do when I realized he was coming after me) and he tried to do harm to me, than yes I would be fully justified in needing a CCW.

A CCW is not about ""being tough"". In fact, when you *have* one you have to not be the tough guy. You have a legal right to carry a deadly weapon, but not the right to brandish it in public like a ""tough guy"" as you put it. In fact the ""tough guy"" thing to do would be to fight him in the street right?

If you (as the original seller) had to sell directly to an end user and not to someone who intends to resell it, you might not find one at all, or might not find one who's willing to buy at an acceptable price. Instead, you find the pawn shop (which is at a central location and buys lots of different kinds of things), and then they deal with finding an end user to sell it to (or, rather, since it's at a central location, the person buying it will come to them... or not, and they now have lost money on something they can't sell.)

The fact that they're not ""poor orphans one meal away from starvation"" doesn't mean that losing money doesn't mean anything - on the contrary, it means they can _afford_ to fail to sell some things, and therefore can afford to buy things they might not be able to sell.

LucasSatie,talesfromtechsupport,1389292317.0,"I really feel that this changes based on location.

My school district is one that overpays its teachers. A full-time teacher with a Bachelor's Degree starts at $37k. Master's starts at $45k. Every after school activity they moderate or coach adds $6.5k to their salary. 

Now, obviously some of these teachers really earn their salaries but I also had a lot of teachers that did nothing outside of class time. They would grade all assignments during class time and thus only worked 8 hours a day. 

One teacher I remember had a BA and had 27 years under his belt and was making $70k for 9 months of 40 hour work weeks. Expand that to a full year and he was making the equivalent of $93k a year. And this isn't including all the paid holidays they get.

Tell me how that's underpaid?

Author's note: I know a lot of this because many teachers were forthcoming about much of this information. That and there was a website that published the teacher's salaries in my school district so we could search for their salaries. 

*I understand not every district is like this, I'm providing my anecdotal evidence to prove that ""teachers are underpaid"" is not always true.*"

To fix the issue you need to let the Logitech Software do it's thing.  First map your Joystick to QWES (This is the best IMO for dodging) or AWSD if you want camera control instead.  In the game you will need to go to System Configuration, go to GamePad settings and TURN OFF Enable Gamepad (This screws things up).  For me I had to reboot my computer for this to take affect.  Now I always run with the joystick and it doesn't randomly start walking a direction after release.

Because I can guarantee that a fall of as little as 5 feet onto a harness can and does cause serious injury without some kind of single use fall arrest system.

Source: I used to climb 150m radio masts for a living, with a fall arrest system consisting of 'scaff hooks' which clipped onto the mast structure, connected to a fall arrest tear away unit as described above by 1m of strong material. The tear away until was about 15cm long, and then connected to the harness. If you fell, you fell a max of ~2m (scaff hooks taught downwards below you -&gt; dangling from scaff hooks, although ideally you should be moving them often enough you only ever fell maybe 50cm), which would cause the tear away unit to deploy to prevent injury, and need to be replaced. I've seen what happens when people fall and the unit fails to deploy properly, or had be fallen on in the past from a shorter distance so appeared to be fine but was already stressed and deployed too easily. Sure, no-one died, but several people ended up with broken limbs, cuts from the harness webbing digging in, bad bruising, unconciousness, etc."

hurston,childfree,1389292448.0,"To take your points in turn :

- A sense of belonging is not strong enough in itself to warrant spending 20 years of your life bringing up a kid. You may get a sense of belonging from doing so, but it is not the cause. A sense of belonging can be had from many places other than having kids.
- Why would others approve of you having kids? There are various reasons (justifications) that would cause this peer pressure, and while someone may give in to peer pressure to have kids, it doesn't necessarily mean they want kids any more than if the peer pressure wasn't there. There are many people who have peer pressure to have kids but still don't want them.
- This is part of the nurturing instinct. Having a kid produces feelings of bonding, happiness, love and fulfilment as a reward for carrying out your biological imperative. Those of us with low or no nurturing instinct may not feel these emotions.

Yes, I agree for most people having children is worthwhile.
Each person may have an answer that satisfies them, but that doesn't mean the answer is correct. If people don't understand how their bodies work, then they can't be expected to be able to express that."

Some people get a job that works Sundays.  That would get you out more.  But again, if your parents are super controlling,  you may not realize that many 16 year olds have jobs and just say 'heading out ma' and leave the house.

So are they going to make your life hell if you resist, and how much is not going to church worth it to you?  It all depends on you and them.  We don't want you to be hurt or financially ruined simply to make a pointless stand when you'll be legally free in 2 years."

Agree 100%.

Young adults can^[1]

 * sign up for the military
 * buy a firearm
 * purchase alcohol and tobacco
 * have unprotected sex
 * have a tattoo

I see no reason to deny a young adult a medical procedure which is safe and will not put their life in direct harm if that is what they so choose at that time.  

This philosophy of ""let's make sure *nobody* makes mistakes"" (e.g. the kids who get sterilized and regret it later) is bad for society.  Maybe after seeing how sad and devastated that ~ 25% is, the rest will think about it more before committing.  This leaves those who are firmly decided with the ability to get their sterilization and a bit more to think about in the way of consequences for those who aren't convinced. 

^[1] I am in no way implying that everyone who makes these decisions at a young age are always making the right decision for their lives at that time.  I am literally saying that they *can* make these decisions.

Poland is completely landlocked. Austria's a lost war away from being history. I do, however, very much agree with Ottomans &amp; France being up there.

Here's my picks :

1 ) France (easy to blob, starts with a huge advantage over England)

2 ) Castile (Somewhat remote, has very nice chokepoints between them and the rest of the continent, a very friendly Portugal, and a free PU over Aragon most of the time, and with the colonist national idea, they can have the most colonists in the game as far as I know)

3 ) Ottomans (hugely strong, in a better tech group than most of it's neighbors, with sick national ideas)

4 ) Denmark (incredibly easy to form Scandinavia with only 1 conquest required)

5 ) Japan Shogun (Dark horse, I know, but, it's SO easy to unite Japan and when you do you're a massive fish in a pretty small pond. Even Ming can't step to you. You won't have any real competition until Russia makes it's way over to you, but it's not too hard to colonize eastward and monopolize Mexico and the NA west coast before the Europeans do, which often gets you in contact with them early enough to westernize, catch up, and compete. Alternatively, you can colonize all those tiny islands in the south Pacific, and get that sweet sweet same continent tax bonuses instead of the usual colony tariffs.

silly87,AskWomen,1389293009.0,"I know the immensely popular opinion here is that there's nothing wrong with a taken man going to strip clubs, but I respectfully disagree.

I believe that if *you* have a problem with it, *you* are justified in feeling the way you feel.  Many women have no problem with it, and that's great for them.  But I think it's wrong for them to shame other women who do take issue, or make them feel like that somehow means they don't trust their partner or that they're insecure.

Most women would *not* be okay with a random girl giving a naked lap dance to their boyfriend/husband, but it suddenly *becomes* okay when you're paying for it and other men and naked women are around.  I think it's a perfectly reasonable reaction for a woman to still not be okay with it.

I never cared if boyfriends went to strip clubs on occasion, though I don't think I ever dated a guy who did.  The deeper in love I fell with my now-husband, the more I felt opposed to the idea of him going to a strip club.  If he wants to fantasize about other women, that's his right.  But no, I don't want other women writhing around on his dick and rubbing their tits in his face.  It's not that I don't trust him--I'm 100% sure that if he went to a strip club, he wouldn't do anything wrong.  He's never actually been to one and has always said the idea doesn't interest him, and that's why he never went before he met me.  So when his friend was having a bachelor party at a strip club, I told my husband I didn't feel comfortable with him going there, but that he should feel encouraged to go to all of the other bars they were planning on going to.  I was actually surprised when his friend was perfectly understanding and didn't question it at all.  Part of me felt like I should just be like all women are expected to be when it comes to strippers-complacent.  But I knew how much it would bother me and it's not like he was begging me to let him go, so I expressed my feelings and he made the decision not to go to the strip club.

No, I'm not insecure.  I'm not afraid he'll like strippers more than me.  I'm very confident and comfortable when it comes to our sex life and how I know he sees me.  I don't view other women as threats.  I trust him.  I'm not afraid he'll cheat with one.  I just didn't feel comfortable with other women being naked and on top of him.  And you know what?  Despite what society has shoved down our throats, *I'm allowed to feel that way and not be called names.*

All that matters is how you feel.  If you're uncomfortable with it but feel that since strangers on the internet say there's something wrong with you for being uncomfortable you should let him go, that's a problem.  If you're pretty okay with it and just wanted to see if others felt the same way-great.  If it's something that will really bother you, tell him.  There are tons of other things guys can do on a bachelor's party.  If you don't think it'll bother you, tell him it's fine.  Either way that you feel is fine and you shouldn't feel like you're in the wrong whether you're okay with it or not."

mrcleanup,relationship_advice,1389293083.0,"&gt;She's currently on disability for the depression but has stopped going to her therapist.

That is because she is self medicating and *you* are her drug of choice.

&gt;The second I'm home from work I have to be with her every second of the day or she will freak out and cry about how I don't love her anymore.

Right, she needs her medication to make her feel better, that's you.

&gt;When we do fight I always stay very calm (which she thinks is because I don't care about her) but she blows up in a rage, screams, throws stuff, has hit me and spit in my face. She always threatens to hurt herself if I left

My ex wife did exactly this. I had strong reservations but I eventually married her because at heart she was a good person and because I knew how much she needed me. I could make it so she had a happy life, how could I deny her that?

Marriage didn't solve anything though, over the next four years the relationship got harder and harder, we fought all the time and I finally caught her cheating with a guy I knew in the hotel we stayed at on our honeymoon when she said she was going to the city to see her therapist, who, incidentally had been urging her to tell me about the affair for quite some time.

What I learned from all this is that you have to be true to your feelings. Be who you want to be and don't compromise your fundamental sense of self out of kindness. I wasn't even letting my ex wife be in a relationship with the real me, she was in a relationship with me acting how I thought would keep her happy. Real me was frustrated and tired of all the stress. We had a relationship based on fiction.

She always yelled and thought that if I didn't, it meant that I didn't care about the argument. Growing up in her family, if you didn't yell, you weren't emotionally invested.

So after the divorce my ex wife slept with a bunch of guys, lived out of her car for a while, lived with her pastor for a while until she got kicked out for not following the rules, generally hit rock bottom and then... she got tired of her own shit and started clawing her way back up, worked with her therapist to get on better meds, and went out and got a master's degree. She is more together now than when I was helping her because as long as I was holding her up she never learned to swim.

I know this is a hard process for you, but it is necessary. We all have to be able to stand on our own two feet, know who we are, accept who we are, be true to ourself, and share that person honestly in order to have a good relationship. It sounds like with the two of you together, neither of you is able to do that; she can't stand on her own, and you are betraying your own happiness in some kind of twisted trade to give it to her, but she can't use your sacrificed happiness, and you are finally realizing that.

It is noble to want to help someone, but you can't be a sacrifice for her.

You are doing the right thing.

[Edit: The other thing I learned is that you find a great relationship, you don't make it. The hardest relationship lesson to learn isn't how to hold on, it is when to let go.]"

Our school have a very detailed (albeit slow) website, where we can report all of our problems - they're then assigned to different support-departments (from remote install, to physical repairs and anything in between).

When I started at the school, so much shit was broken. The worst was a projector with ~1/5 dead pixels.  They'd all whined and complained to each other, but not a single one of them had contacted support - they'd just gone around and whined, and brought it up at meetings.

I reported all the stuff that was broken or unusable, and within two weeks, it was all good.

I remember my Junior year when the website that published the teacher's salaries was mentioned in the newspaper and it caused a major shit storm within the school. The support staff union (administrative assistants, receptionists and the like) went on strike at the end of that school year because of the major disparity between salaries. 

We had one teacher who taught speech, was an assistant coach of the freshman boy's soccer team, directed the spring play and was the coach of the debate team who pulled down $115k one year. And no, he did not teach summer school. "

And finally, if we don't compete/make the playoffs next year then JG and this coaching staff are gone.

In their worldview, putting up with bullshit isn't worth it to them since they aren't emotionally invested. We need to understand each others' perspectives a little more before jumping to judgment calls.

That being said, as someone who prefers commitment, everyone has to compromise and swallow their pride to some degree to make it work in the long run. Even the most level headed people have their moments of irrationality, and a relationship is accepting a person at their best and their worst. You should never have to put up with constant manipulation and distrust, but you need to accept some level of annoyance and misplaced passive aggression.

I expected him to want to run blood tests to check. He did not, stating that blood tests for certain hormones are pretty difficult to use because there is no ""baseline"" of normal. Every woman's body need it's own ""right"" level of P to cycle well. What's right for one may be too low for another and too high for a third. 

He felt confident in skipping a series of costly blood tests, and diagnosing me based on my symptoms. 

We tried one round of clomid last cycle to see if it would ""improve the timing and quality of ovulation"" (I O on cd21 usually) because that might cause my body to start making it's own P sooner (thereby yielding more and lengthening my LP). He said if it was going to work, it would right away. It didn't, so this cycle we are adding in vaginal P suppositories (!)

I think the key is to make sure all your products work together, and that you're applying the thinnest layers possible so that your face isn't inches thick in make up. Less is definitely more. Also try leaving each layer a little while to set before you put the next product on, that way they go on top of each other rather than mixing together and forming a layer of mush that gets everywhere. Another thing you could try but I'm just speculating here, is to get a tissue or a q-tip (no q-tip if you wear contacts though, the little fibres get everywhere and suck ass) and dab along the corner of your eye and waterline to sort of suck up any excess moisture before you apply your make-up. This definitely helps when you line your waterline so I'm thinking it maybe might help a little bit.

Reading your post you seem more intelligent, well spoken, and self aware than most people I see on the internet. I've met some people with really high IQs who are egotistical assholes. There is a lot more to being a rational, moral, and good person than IQ, so don't judge yourself on just that number. Many people have trouble with math, so don't take it to mean that you're stupid. A lot of really smart people think that they can just put in minimal effort in school and pass with flying colors. For some people this works out, and for others it doesn't. What is more important is to be a motivated hard worker with good social skills. These are key to landing a good job, getting promotions, etc. But most people who think they can put in minimal effort don't get very far. So my suggestion is use your imperfections to motivate yourself to be better. 

If you want some tips on math, I can give you a couple (I'm a physics major, so I've had lots of math). Think of math as a toolbox to solve problems quantitatively, many people just seem to think it's a device to torture students, but really it's just an exercise in logic. I got Cs in all my math through calculus 2, but once I got this in my head, I got As from there on out. Just learn the symbols and terminology, as you would learning a language, and from there just try and translate what you see into logic based statements. Also, think about the graph of whatever you're talking about, a lot of the weird symbols and notation you see is just a way of talking about some characteristic of a graph. I hope it gets easier for you. If you want to go into science you will need lots of math, but with how good you are at writing, you may want to try and be a science fiction writer, or something along those lines. Good luck!"

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1389293440.0,"i definitely think it is a common misstep not to view social issues as economic issues, but the main point i was trying to make was simply that capitalism (in many manifestations) provides a very quick route to institutional change because it thrives on flexibility created by competition.

government by nature is going to restrict and allow certain freedoms it situationally shouldn't simply because universal pragmatism is a physically impossible pipe dream.  people who vehemently support or oppose any system of government confuse me because their stance seems to rest on a false premise of human permanence (recourse to ""human nature"" sometimes seems to happen far too quickly in our political world, and it deeply fails to account for inevitable generational shifts which occur as reactions against the issues of a current environment).

capitalism appears to provide an open door policy for economic transformation and i think this likely impacts its ability for rapid social change.  social change occurs when powerful people have beef with the current situation.  people become powerful in capitalist societies by acquiring money and class status.  for a while there was an easy path to gaining these things FOR SOME PEOPLE (college), but the ease of this path flooded the market with powerful people and the worst ones created some very serious problems for the world at large by trying to solve their own petty grievances with greedy means. 

certainly not all social changes in a capitalist system are inherently GOOD, they are simply solutions to old problems that bring with them new problems.  we do not choose the social contracts we are born into, we are merely faced with the options to adhere to, ignore, or attempt to transform our social contract.  for many many many generations slavery was an institution poised in permanence as an element of human nature.  in reality, it was simply a solution to the problems of the powerful: because it's pretty commonly agreed upon that having to work in order to survive is a kinda lame part of being human."

nappythrill22,Sacramento,1389293516.0,"First and best tipoff is mismatching piecemeal parts. If you have ever seen some of the local stolen bike chop shops, look at their inventory (there's one on either Franklin or 24th, south of 12th Ave/Sutterville that has been there for years if you need an example). 

Basically, to prevent the bikes from being identified as stolen, they are often disassembled, and then reassembled with other parts. Usually this mean front and back wheels/tires that don't match, very expensive frames that are scratched up being ridden by someone who is *clearly* too poor to afford that frame, etc.

I'm not saying for certain it *was* stolen, but if you know what to look for, you will start to see them more often that you previously realized.

Right neighborhood, Check. Ghetto/possibly homeless looking dude, check. Peculiar looking bike that resembles other bikes known to be stolen reassembly jobs, check. It's called profiling. The police use it ALL the time, and although it's not enough to give LEOs PC, it can be a *big* tipoff.

&gt;Swing is the temperature difference between where a system comes on and then goes off. EXAMPLE: The thermostat is set at HEAT, a target temperature set at 70F, and the swing number set at 3 (+/-1F). The heat would typically come on at 69 and go off at 71. Most Ritetemp thermostats have the ability to set the swing. Below is a swing chart. The lower number gives a higher comfort level as the room temperature is more constant and the HVAC system will cycle more often. The higher number is more efficient and the HVAC system will cycle less often.

Tarnsman4Life,BDSMcommunity,1389293526.0,"Lets break this down from a Masters prospective

*I have such a lot of guilt and shame about submission that I tend to pull away and reject my dom as soon as the sex is over. Like I'll accuse him of only wanting me for a fuck, will rewrite it in my head so he was taking advantage of me in some way, and feel completely embarrassed about myself.*

First of all you have nothing to be embarrassed about.  Many people, especially women are naturally submissive. Its really a beautiful gift you give. There is nothing to feel dirty about at all. Talk to your Dom about some kind of aftercare.


*I want to embrace my kinks. Any boyfriend I've had has said that I am a natural sub, for whatever reason. My ultimate fantasy is 24/7 submission and I know this.*

That is a good start; being true to yourself and satisfied with who you are is paramount to happiness in life. Have goals, work towards those goals and don't settle.

*So I noticed I only really want to masturbate when a guy (preferably a dom) is aware that I am, and will text guys if I'm horny. Or go on cam, etc. I then decided that I do this because I'm incapable of feeling pleasure without a man manipulating me into it. But that's not true, it's just something I was once told.
And quite a few times, guys have told me ""but I thought you were a NICE girl!"", which I hear.. so much. It makes me question what I'm doing and feel very ashamed. And not a sexy shame.
I like being called a slut during sex, but it's so charged with emotion now, because of the fact that I've been called that with utter disdain. As in, not, ""you naughty slut"" said with desire, but ""you're such a slut"" because I know the word for a kink/fetish, or because I've kissed a guy in public.*

Being turned on and driven to serve dominant men is nothing to be ashamed of, you have a deeply written need to serve, it is natural and you should embrace it. Ignore catty/passive aggressive/people who don't understand you, there is nothing wrong with anything you have posted participating in. Fuck society if they want to label you, the question becomes are YOU happy with your actions.


*My current sort of D/s thing is very intense but we have never discussed a safe word, which I feel is a bit of an issue. He more or less does what he wants until I show obvious resistance. This makes me feel perhaps more insecure than I would otherwise. He also refuses to be my boyfriend but is happy for me to become his slave.
I'm wondering if maybe there needs to be more of a stable/trusting base for this kind of situation? I know you don't have to be a couple but.. does there have to be a kind of love there? If only the kind of love you show for a dear friend?*

If you feel the need for a safeword with your dom then do not be afraid to bring it up in conversation with him. D/S relationships, even the deepest M/S couples thrive on communication and wither due to a lack of it. Don't be afraid to start an open and frank discussion about things you simply can't handle.

Next; define ""boyfriend""? Does he just show interest in ""playing"" with you then kick you out or leave? Or does he simply not wish to do all of the ""Normal"" younger people social functions with you representing himself as your boyfriend?

I would never be a ""boyfriend"" in the classical sense to a slave girl period. Inside or outside the bedroom, you are my slave, I am your Master. That said; I also have no problem going to functions with a girl. Some men/women simply view D/S like this, nothing wrong with it but it's not for everyone.
It all comes down to what do you want from the relationship, what do you NEED from the relationship, what is he giving you and are you happy with what he is giving you. 

*Sometimes my current ""D"" will pull out after quite kinky/rough sex and leave me on my own immediately, which brings up a shitload of abandonment issues and makes me feel like I'm not enough, or did something wrong. This then confuses him because, in his mind, he's fulfilling my fantasy by treating me like just a fucktoy. But I feel like the point is to treat me like a toy.. but one you value a lot in some way? I like being objectified, tied up, used, but I wanna be protected as well and prized and kept safe. I'm not sure how a D would communicate that, all I know is that I feel I don't have it at the moment.*

It sounds like you need some aftercare, if you have not already mentioned all of this to your Dom, you need to. If you have and he doesn't care you need to re-evaluate your relationship with him.

You seem like a natural slave; I wish you the best of luck finding that 24/7 ownership you crave and within your current one.

And when we say the first group is ""feminine"" and the second group is ""masculine"" all we're doing is referring to a very common, relatively inoffensive set of stereotypes for the sake of convenience.

If its closed you should go to Rigoberto's (across the street) and if you're drunk you should go to Sun Taco. Being drunk makes it harder to notice the smell of sewage which consistently permeates the air surrounding sun taco.

Ok, I'll be the one to say it. Downvote away. No. I can't think of anything else other than the rise of a despot, followed by an uprising, is just part of their lifestyle. No other explanation seems to make sense. 

The US has a similar thing. ""Despots"" are large US corporations. When they get too big, with too much control, they might be broken up by the US Supreme Court or people might find an alternative. This type of ""uprising"" ~~is not as damaging as~~ has fewer dead people than other types.

&gt;ISO metric fastener material strength property classes (grades).  As given in ISO 898-1, ISO metric fastener material property classes (grades) should be used.  For example, fastener material ISO property class 5.8 means nominal (minimum) tensile ultimate strength 500 MPa and nominal (minimum) tensile yield strength 0.8 times tensile ultimate strength or 0.8(500) = 400 MPa.  (In a few cases, the actual tensile ultimate strength may be approximately 20 MPa higher than nominal tensile ultimate strength indicated via the nominal property class code.  Consult Table 10, below, for exact values.)  Many anchor bolts (L, J, and U bolts, and threaded rod) are made from low carbon steel grades, such as ISO classes 4.6, 4.8, and 5.8.

Basically metric class 4.* is pretty similar to grade 2, class 8.* is pretty similar to grade 5, and class 10.* is pretty similar to grade 8."

SlickKat88,LucidDreaming,1389293747.0,"I've started to think this as well. There are at least four different locations that I frequent throughout my dreams. Each time I am in them I find that I'm approaching similar scenarios/questions/issues that I have previously in those locations. For example, there is this large three story house that I arrive in. In the house I walk as I would in reality, though the house is suspended in complete darkness (sort of like stuff floating in space) and I float when I exit the home. Often times there are people there, as if I'm entertaining a small get-together. The faces are never clear, but I'm often facing the issue of finding balance between them and I. I'm starting to think that they are manifestations of various parts of me.  

Other locations include a large school (similar to a college) where I am in a race for time and unable to remember my directions though I feel as if I have been traveling the hallways long enough to know them like the back of my hand. Failure is often associated here.  

So, all in all, I definitely experience something like this during my dream states. Figuring out the meaning is the exciting part, I think."

Basically I decided on a pessimist approach,  I talked to my docs went off BC and consulted an acupuncturist that specialized in fertility. She had me chart my temps for a 2 months while I came off BC meds (we used condoms during that time) and then we used diet and needles to adjust my cycle temps a bit to make conditions ripe for  baby.

 * stretch daily
 * avoid processed ""junk"" and ""fast"" foods, eat fruits, veggies, and ""organic"" foods if possible. 
 * exercise semi-weekly minimum, put up the money for at least one personal trainer session so you can state your goals and get a list of exercises that can help you achieve it. 

**establish financially healthy habits**

 * Figure out when you wanna retire. 40? 50? 60? Older?

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1389293925.0,"I play at a shop that gets 16-20 people for standard FNMs. The meta is midrange heavy, consistent players include two gruul ramp decks, three U/W control, two mono black devotion, one mono blue devotion, and one esper control, along with a collection of assorted players who don't show up regularly enough to be predicted. I usually go 3-1, and go 4-0 more often than I go 2-2 or lower. Blue white control is the hardest matchup.

The decklist is:

Mainboard:

4x favored hoplite

4x hopeful eidolon

4x ethereal armor

4x pacifism

4x observant alseid

2x fabled hero

2x ordeal of heliod

4x divine favor

2x Calvary Pegasus

4x gods willing

4x brave the elements

2x Phalanx leader

1x banisher priest

17x plains

Sideboard:

4x rootborn defenses

2x ray of dissolution

4x celestial flare

3x glare of heresy

2x last breath

The deck effectively curves out at three, so you play it more like an old school red sligh than a traditional white weenie. A one land hand is viable provided you have a one drop creature and at least two ethereal armor. A one drop creature, two lands, and three ethereal armor is a turn three kill.

The strat changes depending on how much and what kind of removal the enemy has. If they're running red and relying on burn for removal, then you push full bore. One enchantment will take most of your creatures out of burn range, and you'll go for the kill quickly. If they're running green and are relying on big creatures and deathtouch to handle aggro, then you use pacifism to lock their creatures down, or pro green to dodge them until you can get an ethereal armor for first strike. A turn three polukranos looks small in comparison to a hoplite with a divine favor and ordeal on it.

Blue and black are treated similarly. Black is the easier matchup because black is trying to advance their own board state which means that they have to choose between a doom blade and an on curve pack rat, or a downfall and propogating a rat, and if you can give your creature pro black by keeping one mana open you make them waste a turn against a deck that averages a turn five kill. That's back breaking. Post board, a lot of black decks will opt for devour flesh, and you'll need to adjust slightly, play two creatures, and wait for the devour flesh before you voltron, unless one creature is a phalanx leader, then you can voltron the leader, and still buff your other creature. If they do opt for pushing their board state, you'll blow up their packrats, bestow an eidolon, and lifegain faster than they can Gary.

Blue, blue white to be specific, is a pain in the ass because they don't have anything to do in the early turns except screw with your board. Detention sphere, rift, voyages end, counterspells, and the omni present threat of a verdict post turn four makes it a nightmare. If I had the land base, I would consider splashing red for boros charm, but I don't, and the deck is very white mana dependent. The goal is to try and put yourself far enough ahead by turn four that you can shoestring a win before they find their elspeth or aetherling. You'll probably draw one, maybe two defensive cards, and if you're really lucky, they won't pull a verdict until turn five, when you'll probably have rootborn and enough mana to cast it.

white, on the other hand, is brutal, because you can't go pro white without losing your enchants. Chained to the rocks is a backbreaker, as is pacifism pre board. Fortunately white is seen as a weak color, so you won't see those cards very often, and white is also choosing to forgo advancing their own board in order to hinder yours, so it can stretch out longer than usual, and give you a chance to recover.

winkers,AskWomen,1389294120.0,"I'm a guy and am *not* going to share my story re: this topic.  I just wanted to point out that 'taking a life' in any context is typically a wedge issue, where it will quickly divide up people into distinct camps.  You can just see that from most of the comments here (supportive vs. unsupportive).

My advice is that when you do share this part of your life with someone that you also accompany it with some emotional context for that moment and going forward in the future.  ""I've killed people"" is different than ""I was in close/live combat"" and even that is different than ""I've had to fight for my life.  It was something that I would not wish on anyone.""

Anyway, to address an unasked question that I see by reading between the lines in your post, you are not scary per se from reading your various replies and history.  I don't know if you smile naturally, like to talk about things other than violence, or have a kind presence.... but.... here's my advice... Truly envision the kind of person you would like to be for yourself and your circle and then be that person through good acts."

The cheese not being (mostly) melted is another big difference between the burger they photograph and a real burger.

So from that perspective, just hold on and you're apt to start meeting people you connect with. (Quite honestly, if one of my friends said they loved middle school I would be a little scared.) 

Your issue is confidence. Why in the world would you actively tell your only real-life friends that you're anti-social and overweight? I promise, they can detect that on their own. Your whole post is just filled with nothing but negativity and being down on yourself. Do I understand the feeling? Absolutely. But from someone a few years farther down the road, being down on yourself is the best way to stay lonely. Confidence is one of the few things in life that ""fake it 'til you make it"" is a valid approach. You have to get out and do things in real life. Exercise. Devote time to friends. Take a chance, and then take another, and if you fuck up you realize that everyone fucks up in high school and you try again. But again: it gets better. It gets so much better.


TL;DR: Things get better when you take action to make them better, and being down on yourself is the best way to make sure everyone else thinks of you that way too. "

tom641,Cynicalbrit,1389294225.0,"On the subject of the game being balanced around 6v6, i'd like to point out something from LoL they did recently. They've been introducing alternate playmodes that only stick around for a short time, and play radically different. I like to think of them as something like the Mutations from Left 4 Dead 2, back when they cycled through them every week. And yeah, it was good silly fun, and one of the modes was the option to have 5v5 matches where each team gets one champion with 5 people playing it. So you'd get 5 Ziggs VS 5 Kassadins and it was silly and fun and unfair as all fuck most of the time. You'd have one champion, Fiddlesticks, who can ""fear"" someone and basically stun them for 3 seconds, and you have everyone on the team chainstunning so they can have 15 SECONDS of time to beat on them without any chance of fighting back. It caused a lot of issues in the mode, because that's not how the game was balanced. So don't try to change Titanfall even if you don't like the idea of only 6v6 FPS combat, it'll be a much worse game for it."

With my father I have few 'safe' topics like baseball that we can prattle on for hours about.  If you don't have those, good conversationalists often ask 'how's work?' or 'how was your weekend?'/'Any good projects?'  Sometimes people are boring, but usually they are interested in at least one thing that you are.

It's also possible he's listening but not comprehending since he doesn't understand your world, and knows that you are shy so doesn't want to impose his ignorant opinion on it."

This is like the record label industry, or car dealerships.  The manufacturer (Wizards, or a band, or Ford) benefits from local resellers (LGS, Record labels, Car dealerships) who add value to the product.  But I can still go to a ford dealer and order exactly what I want.  What if I could go to my LGS and order exactly what I wanted, at fixed prices? And if my LGS decides to go above MSRP to rip off players, I'll find another LGS. 

I don't think cards need to retain value for the game to retain value.  I am frustrated that I want to play legacy because of the depth and card choice available in the format, but I am locked out because of the price of entry.  I understand people who have already purchased cards at inflated prices will have ""lost"" money.

Whatever field you're going into, go on craigslist, monster, ect and start looking for the basic qualification requirements of the entry level job in that field. Not your dream job, the actual job you will need to take when you graduate and are broke and desperate. Make a list of EXACTLY what skills and programs they are looking for. Doesn't matter how prestigious your college is. Sacrificing a few ""fun"" electives for things like basic photoshop and web-design will open up doors for you when you graduate. I promise you. 

The reason is this--I looked at the college course guide like a kid in a candy store, and I definitely had a blast, but at the end of the day I paid about 100k and was lacking some basic skills I had to teach myself later.

I know this isn't the sexy type of answer you were looking for, but the truth is it's a lot easier to go out for drinks with friends/girls, hit up music festivals, buy drugs, and travel to exotic places when you have a job that's paying you more than minimum wage.

This is really important when explaining your arguments to capitalists (especially libertarians/ancaps).  Many libertarians will definitely agree that state intervention on behalf of corporate interests can greatly limit people's options and make it harder for them to own their own businesses or form co-ops.  I am absolutely against this, I just think that in a truly freed market, some people might still choose to work for a boss and I don't have a problem with that.

However, she couldn't get past it, and that's why there has been no wedding for the past 5 years. Now she is reaching the point where she realizes she either has to marry you or leave you and find someone else to start over before her bio clock runs out.

steve496,nfl,1389294590.0,"The thing about Kap (as opposed to, say, Cutler) is that he hasn't been a starter for very long.  If we extend him this offseason he'll only have been starting for a year and a half, and while the team's been very successful during that time, he personally has not been impressive for all of it (although part of that, admittedly, is that he was dealing with a decimated WR corps).

Hence, while I think he's going to get paid, I don't think he's going to get paid quite to the extend that Flacco (or even Cutler) did.  The situation is perhaps most analogous to Aaron Rodgers, who signed an extension after one full season as a starter for 6 years and $65 million.  Admittedly that was in 2008 - there will be some inflation - but I don't know if it gets up to $20 million.

My best guess would be something to the tune of 5 years and $80-90 million.  I think he gets paid; I think he gets paid a lot.  But I think it stops short of the $20 million mark."

Consoles cease playing games with each gen now. PC has no such problem. 

&gt;product reliability

The PS3/360 had massive reliability issues...

Locking them down to one platform? Or making them rehash a series that needed to die e.g. Halo to the point that the devs left and formed a new studio?

&gt;online service

No better but you pay for it. Right...

&gt;community

This is entirely down to perception. Having played on each platform I've found it's gone in this order, from best to worst: PC, PlayStation, Xbox.

Umm... you can get Netflix on any PC. And probably most phones too.

I can also sympathize with the lack of maternity leave in the US, but I think there's also a need to acknowledge that much of the world has moved on. For instance, I'm in Canada and mothers get 15 weeks plus a shared pool of 35 parental weeks. But I suppose that's just the US-centrism of reddit.

Aside from that, I think it's important to distinguish between two types of male complaint. If you're talking about formal power structures and a dude says 'well men are sexually harassed too', then he has failed to appreciate the central point you are trying to make.

But I don't want to lump in men who want to talk about prison rape when we're talking about rape, or the higher drop out rate for men if we're talking about education. I've been in plenty of threads were guys have been accused of 'derailing' when they genuinely think that the experience of men is relevant to the discussion.

Excluding male experience from those kinds of discussions - especially if done with dismissiveness - is what leads to the birth of the more vitriolic men's right circles. That to me is counter productive."

I think you're right, but I think some guys get really pounded with the message that approaching women is somehow ""bad"" -- if you listen to some women, they talk about male interest like every man who hits on them is another straw on their back, and they're about ready to break.  

We don't teach boys how to approach girls, and girls how to handle that (or -- even more radically -- teaching gender neutral ways of expressing interest and gracefully rejecting it when its not wanted), we just leave it for them to figure out on their own in a world full of really conflicting messages.  The closest we ever come to *teaching* gender relationships is ""sensitivity training,"" which is exactly what leads to men using this zero-pressure approach."

He was probably the best husband my mom ever had. My sister's dad was an addict, and was physically abusive towards my mom. When my sister was born, my mom left him (moved states away), unwilling to put her baby through the abuse. He died of an overdose when she was 12 or 13, and she never got to meet him. For good reason, though. My mom certainly wasn't going to fly out there with her, and she didn't want my sister to be alone with him if he was on drugs.

My dad has narcissistic personality disorder, and decided to leave my mom (for an ex-girlfriend of his - that whole thing was a mess my junior year of highschool) after 18 years of marriage when she stopped allowing him to manipulate her. He was emotionally abusive towards all of us, and the only one of us that speaks with him is my brother.

So, my mom's gotten much closer with her first husband. They were married when she was 18 or 19, and my mom says they 'were just too young.' He wasn't abusive. He wasn't an addict. They parted on really good terms. He wanted to fly down and meet everyone. It wasn't as though he was forced to interact. And it was really cool, to me, that we all got along so well. It was kind of weird, though, because he's basically an animal whisperer the same way I am. And he also said that I reminded him more of my mom than my sister did, which is another thing that has never been said to me. If you look at pictures of my mom when she was my sister's age, they look exactly the same. I take after my dad's side a lot more. 

Besides which, they were married and divorced about 40 years ago. It's not like he's been pining away somewhere leading an unhappy and miserable life. From what my mom has said, he's a pretty charismatic guy. I don't think he's been unhappy and alone for forty years.

So, I mean, I guess for some people that kind of situation would be heart breaking, but it wasn't in **this** situation with **these** people, if that makes any sense."

- I'm going for repeatable precision so I need computer controlled movement &amp; positioning on a straight rail and smooth mechanics with no play or slop.
- I'm designing for manufacturing so every part I choose has to be easy to manufacture or available in quantity off the shelf.
- I'm shipping so I have the added constraint of shaving as much weight as I can.

The rail will be the biggest part and the first one I want to avoid shipping.  By picking a commercially available straight edged ladder from a (inter?)national supplier I make sure all my customers can locally source the rail themselves, at whatever length they need."

My foster mother slapped her hand on the table mid rant and told her that she lost her chance to have control over my life. That they would actually treat meet like a person abd that they would support whatever I did. And if I messed up then I would get the proper type of punishment.

Let me also say I am unequivocally, 100% behind gay marriage in every state. I am on your side politically in every measurable way. 

I want to say all of that because I want to push back, just slightly, against what you're saying here. Not because I don't agree but because I think you/we might be parsing what this individual said incorrectly. 

**Wasn't it ALSO political?** Is there any way it couldn't be? And, if in your instance it wasn't, do you think it wasn't political for other people? I guess I am asking whether it being about love and it being about politics are necessarily mutually exclusive. I love my partner and I may someday marry him but I'm not going to pretend that wouldn't be a financial and a political arrangement. At the center of every marriage there should be love but inasmuch as this is a deeply politically contested issue, I am not sure this professor is wrong at the text level. A bigot and an idiot? Sure. But I'm not sure that is the same thing. 

I think for the judges that passed the issue, this was a political decision. I think the people who took advantage of the window were doing so for political motivations alongside all the other reasons you want the state to recognize your committed relationship. The problem I have with this professor cum politician is that there isn't anything WRONG with it being political. I want it to be political because I want real change at both a federal and a state level. I am totally fine with that. I think her statement is meant to demean and undermine your love for your partner and the love of countless other people and that's absolutely shitty and wrong. But I love the rhetoric she uses to do it because her rhetoric bespeaks a fundamental misunderstanding with what's at stake. Your LOVE isn't going to change or alter based on a marriage license. That love stood up for fourteen years without her approval or anyone else's. The marriage, on the other hand, was an opportunity, it was political, and it says a lot about what the citizens of Utah want for themselves and their neighbors and the state. And that's great, isn't it? 

Maybe I'm way off the mark but I think she's basically shooting herself in the foot. It won't sound that way to the people who agree with her, it never does. But it says a lot about the fight AGAINST marriage equality and it contains its own counter-argument. "

Instead, add two more Call of the Conclaves (2 for 3 is value town)  and 2 more Dryad Militants. If you can afford it, run 4 Experiment Ones instead of Dryad Militants, because they're a much better one drop. 

Take out the two Sundering Growth and sideboard them; if you really need instants in the two slot, put in 4 Selesnya Charms (only 30 cents a piece) and maybe 2 Dryad's Militant. The Selesnya charms are extremely versatile and can help you get rid of fatties and gods, or flash you 2/2 vigiliance or helps you trample or save your creatures.

After while it nearly everyday. and once or twice months after this ritual started we got a little handsy 2-3 times. Now I consider all those times just hanging out. WE did them after and before the handsy thing came in. and HAndsy was never discussed or mentioned. According to you would they all be a hundred dates?"

stln00b,AskReddit,1389295056.0,"I'm sure I have quite a few, but the story about the blizzard/sex shop reminded me of this.

Many years ago I was working for a chain of convenience stores in the midwest.

Well one night a storm came in to town and it started snowing *heavily*. Not a blizzard, but we still had like 5-7' snow drifts in the morning.

Anyway, by 8-9pm, it had already dumped so much snow that I couldn't move my car. I called my district manager and told her that I wasn't going to be able to make it in the morning because of the snow.

She began bemoaning the fact that a lot of other people had called out and she really needed me to be there in the morning. I explained that while I appreciated her position, if I couldn't move my car, I couldn't get there. She then tells me ""Well, call me in the morning, if you still can't move your car, I'll come get you.""

OK, that sounds fair. So I check in the morning and low and behold, I can't move my car. I page her and when she calls back, I let her know and she says ""OK, give me a few minutes.""

She calls a coworker with a Jeep and makes him come get me and take me to work. Cool. No biggie.

Sun comes out, snow starts melting, and by the time I'm done with my shift, the streets are fine. Just a bit wet.

Anyway, I obviously don't have a car, so I call the district manager who said she would give me a ride *to* work, to see if she could give me a right *from* work.

She tells me that she would love to, but it would be inappropriate.

I really disliked that woman."

Similar reasons why Indonesian food isn't mainstream, nor Burmese.

The only time I did enter a Jolibee in San Diego, I thought it was just a KFC &amp; Burger Chain that served some Filipino food. Speaking from an ethnic Chinese perspective, Filipino food, prepared by my Filipino friends' mothers, reminds me of Americanized-Chinese food, instead of say, other Asian cuisines.

bitbucket87,AskMen,1389295369.0,"When we got there, the ambulance had already taken him to the hospital.  He was pronounced an hour later.

It was a gunshot wound to the head (357).  Initially everyone thought it was self inflicted, but within 48 hours the cops took his wife into custody.  Turns out she had been having an affair, shot him, and tried to make it look like a suicide.  Why she shot him instead of divorce was never really explained.  He was laying in bed and had GSR on one of his hands, indicating he had a hand up in defense.

She went up for life with no parole.  Best part is she was a prison guard.  I guess her years as a 911 operator and reading crime novels made her think she could get away with it.  This was coming up on 13 years ago.

Worst part?  2 weeks before this happened, they found practice suicide notes in her tower after her shift.  She was trying to get his handwriting right.  This was brought to the attention of her supervisor, who called the sheriff.  She spun a story about how she was a writer (true) trying to get into the head of one of her characters.  The sheriff and DA decided there was no crime and nothing they could charge her with.  They didn't bother informing her husband or anything.  Two weeks later he was dead.

I cleaned up the mess off their waterbed as best I could (think pulp fiction here) and went home.  We put her up in our place, fed her our food, and put our dogs outside for two days so her dogs could be inside with her.  We were weirded out for a long time after that.

hurston,childfree,1389295545.0,"The first two points can be summed up as the effects of hormones by proxy. People who have a strong nurturing instinct are not able to comprehend not having kids. As I said in another comment, they think that people who do not want kids are either confused or that there is something wrong with them. It is their job to tell them to do the right thing and have a kid, which they think will make the other person happy, even though it may not. Peers pressure may make people HAVE kids, but it doesn't make people WANT kids.

The nurturing instinct doesn't just kick in after the fact, though it is greatly increased by having a child of your own. People will make cooing noises over other peoples kids, though for some, there is less of a nurturing instinct and they only like their own kids. There are people who grieve if they are unable to have kids. There are people who will end a relationship if the other person doesn't want kids. There are people who will get married to someone they don't really like but is available and have a kid before dumping them because it was really all about having a kid. These are not the actions of people acting on reason.

The answer to your final point about the experiment is possibly. I know of one women who after having a kid refused any further sex, having got what she really wanted. There is of course a much higher chance people have kids if they both want sex and want kids. Of course, the experiment is immediately answered by contraceptives. You don't need to have kids to have sex. Why spend twenty years bringing up kids if it is only about the sex? No reason at all."

And they'll have to hire someone else to do them now, and maybe they won't be as efficient or effective in doing so, so it'll seem like they're working harder. But they aren't, and the office will likely suffer for it.

If she wanted you to do more work than you were hired to do, she should've offered you a raise in addition to the extra responsibility she wanted you to take upon yourself.

When you get hired, they aren't buying your time. They're buying your effort. If you complete your job with extra time available, that's still *your* time. All they bought was the effort required to complete whatever you finished, and you gave that to them.

I keep saying this, so I'll just reiterate: If a boss wants you to do more, they should be willing to pay you more to do it. Who was doing it before you got there? How much were they getting paid?

crankypants15,NeutralPolitics,1389295575.0,"Many stores already donate non-produce items (canned or boxed) to food pantries in my area. Why should they donate to SNAP when there is a process already in place? The problem is, no store wants to risk a lawsuit by donating produce past its expiration date, if someone gets sick. (In ""produce"" I include fresh fruits, veggies, and most anything that needs to be refrigerated.)


Also, the SNAP program limits buyers to certain products but cashiers rarely enforce this, thus there is a huge loophole for SNAP recipients to buy junkfood using your taxes. 
Alcohol is an obvious thing cashiers will not permit.

use_more_lube,explainlikeimfive,1389295579.0,"Turn it around - why do women have so little hair compared to other primates, even female ones? 

I think the aquatic ape theory is wrong, [and I'm not the only one](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/19/science/why-humans-and-their-fur-parted-ways.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm) 

Given we ""nest"" in the same place, parasites (fleas, lice) could build up in our home.  A gorilla or chimp will find a new place to sleep every night but we didn't. 

Naked skin is easy to check for parasites, so selection probably favored the hairless. 

Babies are now born hairless (they have body hair until about the 8th month of pregnancy, then shed it all in utero, so this is fairly ""recent"") and our species favored it. 

As to why? Well, sexual selection and natural selection.

Aleysia,AskWomen,1389295799.0,"I was in an emotionally abusive LDR, and it started out abusive but I didn't recognize the red flags for what they were, for several reasons that I won't get into.

I started out very much in love, but obsessed with trying to better understand his personality -- I guess part of me was looking for a comforting explanation. He always had a reasonable-sounding explanation for everything he did and for everything I did wrong in his eyes. I believed him, because I've always been around people that were self-aware and considerate, so I didn't suspect his words and figured he must be saying these things because they were true.

There were a few good moments, as there always are, and I prolonged the relationship partly because I didn't want to lose those, partly because I thought I could change things if only I could get at the root of his issues, and partly because I still cared at that point if he thought my reasons were trivial and unimportant and easily dismissed.

I finally ended the relationship when I realized that I was crying several times a week, too embarrassed to tell my friends how things were going, thankful when he worked nights so I wouldn't have to talk to him, uncomfortable with being anything other than cheerful/accommodating/opinion-less shell of a person around him, and living with a dark cloud over my head the rest of the time. 

The breakup was every bit as bad as I knew it was going to be, though made much easier by the fact that we were long-distance. He raged and claimed that I was giving up without even trying and begged me not to break up with him (and said things like, ""you didn't tell me you don't like being manipulated!""). I was sad because I still cared about him, but I knew that he was the problem and I just wanted to be done with it. I was distraught for 1-2 days and couldn't concentrate at work at all, but I no longer had that cloud hanging over me. I hadn't realized how heavily the whole thing weighed on my heart -- the shame, the anger and sadness, the worrying about what the future would look like.

I regret the relationship very much, but not what I learned from it. I'm actually much better off now (6 months post-relationship) than I was before it (15 months ago). Those 6 months, I've spent working on myself and am now worlds happier with my life. Fortunately or unfortunately, one of the major things that initially motivated was the realization, post-breakup, that I have to not only protect my own interests but also actively pursue them. Not to be selfish and inconsiderate obviously, but just an awareness of the fact that there really are people who will walk all over me without a slightest care if I let them, and that the universe won't necessarily drop good things/people/etc. into my lap.

nikorasu_the_great,ExploreFiction,1389295804.0,"""And that's how you win."""
Misanthropy-Divine,introvert,1389295804.0,"What I mean by that point is that you shouldn't pursue a relationship as a means to cure your unhappiness with yourself. If you're saying, ""If only I had a girlfriend, everything would be better,"" then you probably shouldn't go looking for a girlfriend, because then suddenly she's your ""savoir,"" or you'll realize that she's not going to take your problems away (no one except yourself can take your problems away), and then you'll dump her and move on, inflicting a pretty wide swath of emotional destruction and not making any progress to show for it. I've seen this happen multiple times, and it never ends well. Fix your issues first; make sure you're okay living with yourself before finding a relationship.

Who cares if you go against the grain a little, or even a lot? I'll give you a glimpse into my own life: In an unabashed fan of metal and am in multiple bands; I pretty much live in the sci-fi and fantasy genres in my free time; when it comes to my wardrobe, I've been told several times I look like I've walked right out of the 1990s at my most recent, have 18-inch-long hair, and have a collection of t-shirts which pretty much advertise my aforementioned loves of metal, sci-fi, and fantasy. In short, I'm an unabashed oddball that sticks out like a sore thumb everywhere I go. Even so, most of the people I've taken the time to cultivate a friendship with respect and appreciate me for being my own person, even if I do come off as a bit odd. The ones who don't simply don't pay me any mind, and that's fine with me, as well.

What's the moral of that rant? It takes time, but once you get comfortable in your own shoes, the people who are worth it will stick around.

coveredinbeeees,Christianity,1389295827.0,"&gt;If someone's view that  
&gt;&gt;a relationship that does not end in marriage is a failure  

&gt;then they have not been given a healthy model or practice to dating.

I agree. However, I think that this attitude is often the natural extension of the statement ""the goal of dating is marriage.""  If the goal of dating is marriage, then any relationship that does not result in marriage is a failure to accomplish that goal.

&gt;What needs to happen is that if dating someone doesn't work out it should be viewed as, ""Okay, so here were the red flags in this relationship. I'm going to make note so I don't make the same mistakes or look for the wrong thing again.""

This is actually a good example of the issues I have with saying that marriage is the goal of dating - it too often assumes that if a relationship ends, it's because of ""red flags"" or ""mistakes"" when that is not necessarily the case. I believe that it is possible for two people to have a relationship that is not a ""mistake"", but doesn't result in marriage.

&gt; I think maybe it would be better worded to add, ""...to that person.""

Sorry, I should have made that explicit in my definition - the purpose of dating someone is to determine whether you should marry that person.  As such, dating at an age where marriage is not a realistic possibility can only have limited usefulness."

""Labeling for Fish

Except for raw molluscan shellfish, certain species of large tuna, certain aquacultured fish, and fish eggs that have been removed from the skein and rinsed, if fish are intended for raw or undercooked consumption, they must be properly frozen before they are served. If this process is done off-premises, purchase specifications ensuring that proper freezing techniques are used to destroy parasites must be provided. Labeling or other information should accompany the product to advise as to whether the product was frozen properly. This is necessary because fish from natural bodies of water may carry parasitic worms that can infect and injure consumers who eat such raw fish dishes as sushi, ceviche, green (lightly marinated) herring, and cold-smoked salmon. The worms are often deeply imbedded inside fish muscle. Thorough freezing kills these worms if the fish are subjected to a low enough temperature for a long enough time.""

Sorry but I don't agree with this. I don't go to the /r/xboxone subreddit and start talking about things unrelated to xbox? A subreddit is a dedicated place to talk about that thing. You don't go to subreddits to talk about music you like or something funny related to the internet, you go there to talk about that topic.

what_a_cat_astrophe,AskWomen,1389296041.0,"My boyfriend keeps in touch with his ex girlfriend.  She is very emotionally unstable and it isn't too uncommon for her to say some very inappropriate, sexual things to him on occasion when she is drunk (to which he just ignores her).  The nature of their 6 month relationship (about 3 years ago) revolved mostly around him wanting out, and her essentially threatening to hurt herself if he left.

She bothers me, but I trust him enough to let it go.  I have no reason to feel discomfort or worry unless he were to encourage it.  Besides, if he's really worth the love I feel for him, I wouldn't have to worry in the first place."

mkvgtired,news,1389296050.0,"In all fairness, the lines are a bit blurred. Most of the borders in the ""Middle East"" are remnants of a former imperialist age. For instance a lot of people would likely consider Eastern Turkey ""Middle East"" but many would probably not consider Istanbul to be. 

For instance I was lucky enough to be able to visit Eastern Turkey and Northern Iraq. Under the Ottoman empire the the Kurds were a separate territory. After WWI, the Kurds were poised to get their own country, but Ataturk, a Turkish/Ottoman General conquered them during negotiations. Because the allies were so warn down from war, they accepted Turkey's current borders, along with the borders of Iraq and Syria that negated any self rule to Kurds. In short, ""Kurdistan"" would be Middle Eastern, but Modern Turkey straddles Asia/Middle East and Europe. 

The Turks are still fighting the Kurds. Only in the past few decades have the Iraqi Kurds gotten mostly autonomous status. Yet they still fight with the South. And the Kurds in Iraq still fight with Turkey, leading to Turkish military attacks in Iraq fairly often (not most people know this). This is just one tiny corner of this disputed region, so as you can see, plotting definite borders can be difficult in such a fluid region.

[This is obviously a parody](http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-september-4-2013/sir-archibald-mapsalot-iii) but unfortunately not too far off. 

TL;DR: Middle Eastern borders are a complete cluster fuck. So dont feel bad if you didnt know the exact borders, because in all honesty, they're relatively new and more of a concept than a definite border. "

They would have us come in to do pricing and stock, and when we argued that we were working for no pay, they would say ""but you are making your base rate, just with no commission"".

KRNMERCILESS,weightroom,1389296257.0,"Here's a personal anecdote that I've learned from training the general population. Take it for what you will, but I feel as its more appropriate than spouting off the science behind it.

When I get a new client who claims to be sedentary, I'll have them do a set of single leg-lower (both legs up, drop one without touching the floor, back up and switch) to test their core function. This loosely mimics the ab activation pattern that happens during walking. **I'll show them how to perform the exercise, but will not go into the deeper queues of the exercise.** Things I look for are things such as how their pelvis/lower back is aligned against the floor, how their pelvis/lower back shift during the exercise as well as what muscles are activating.

It *should* be that when both legs are up, the pelvis has a slight posterior tilt, and the dropped leg side remains flat to the floor. However, what I'm seeing is people anteriorly tilting their pelvis, causing their lower back to arch and hinge through the movement causing ""lower back pain."" This is where I'll go into the deeper queues of the exercise to get them aligned how I want (lowerback tight to the floor, hips slightly off the ground, hands by their side, inhale as they go down), and then have them re-perform the exercise, and all of a sudden they feel it in their abdominals. 9/10 their lowerback pain is gone. I'm batting 100%, but there is always margin of error. ^((eg., people with spinal disorders)^)

All of that being said, walking with heavy weight is most productive in *proper alignment.* I find that concentrating on shoulders back, staying tall, slight squeeze through the glutes and full extension through the legs (at the hip and knee) during the natural gait cycle places a great amount of stress to all aspects of the core (especially depends on the exercise."

This is because they tend to see markets as both naturally emerging and the most efficient way to allocate resources (which I generally agree with, with some exceptions).

However, what anarcho communists really believe, if I understand correctly, is that in a world where each individual has access to means of production, they will be able to produce whatever they want and because they enjoy doing so, they will have no problem giving away the excess as long as their needs are met by others.  So for example, those who enjoy gardening and farming will grow food for everyone, those who enjoy construction will build buildings, those who enjoy carpentry will make furniture, etc.

I've also seen the view that this was the natural social order before states forced people to use money.  People would just make things, and if you needed something from another person, you just asked for it."

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389296383.0,"&gt;So are you attracted to skills and talents (assuming the skilled individual is someone you find attractive physically)?

Yes, strongly so, to the point where it will make a plain girl look beautiful in my eyes if she's got skills I admire.

&gt;If so, what skills, talents, and passions attract you?

Artists, musicians, and women who are really good at crafts.  Like if a woman can knit a beer cozy, I immediately think more highly of her.  If a woman sings, I'm putty in her hands.  I have no defense against a woman with a pretty singing voice.

The women I'm always most attracted to are very creative, intuitive, smart and feminine women, and they all express that through their skills and talents, so when I recognize a woman has those skills and talents, I take an interest because they usually connect back to those personality traits I find admirable in women."
Flugelnull,AskWomen,1389296389.0,"I think guys list 'emotional' and 'not crazy' in the same category. 

Although I hate to generalize, most women are more emotional than men. That is not to say they act on these emotions, but they're more aware of them. Women also occupy a different social space than women. A good example is the cliche of women ""being-nice-to-someone-they-hate"" trope used in TV shows and movies. Things like that don't make any sense to us.

The term crazy comes from the few who *do* act on these emotions. Since men are often poor communicators with a narrower emotional spectrum, we can't follow the logic that leads to this behaviour. When we see other girls empathizing and sympathizing, we assume it's a girl thing and brush it off as all women being crazy.

Sorry for the sweeping generalizations, I watch mean girls last night and didn't understand it."

inamorata4,AskWomen,1389296399.0,"This is definitely true.  As we get older (30+), pretty much everyone in the dating pool has significant baggage from exes, that's just a given - the norm, not the exception.  I'm a 32/F, and I can think of very few instances when someone I've dated since I've been in my 30s actually spoke fondly of an ex.  Most of them were labeled ""crazy"" in one way or another.  It's very easy to hate on a bf's ex alongside him, but as I've gotten older (and been called ""crazy"" myself by a few men), I've become skeptical.    
To summarize, guys I've dated have slapped the ""crazy"" label on women who: show strong emotion, ever cry during an argument, don't show enough emotion, act too possessive for his liking, cheated on him, have significant body-image issues (what woman doesn't?), have had substance abuse issues, ever disagreed strongly with him on some issue(s), etc.  These are not desirable traits in a partner, and there are degrees of ""bad"" to each one depending on the individual, but I don't think it means these people are inherently bad or evil people, like they're made out to be.  If you've dated 50-100 people by the time you're 30 (what I'm guessing the average is), atleast a few of these issues are bound to pop up in a few people.  
So basically, since I naturally assume/know that everyone has some form of ex-baggage, when I see a guy listing ""no crazies"" in his dating profile, that just tells me right off the bat that he's quick to round people down to ""crazy"" when they do anything not to his liking, and I'm gonna have to listen to hours and hours of him ranting about how horrible his exes were, and then he'll probably end up doing the same about me when we inevitably break up.

The only thing that worked for us was exhaustion.  Run them, run them every day.  My big baby is the sweetest most well behaved guy I have ever had when he is exercised regularly and a pure evil ball of destruction when he is not.  It sucks sometimes getting up 30 minutes earlier, but it saves my house and my sanity.  At the bare minimum we do 1.5 miles (loop the neighborhood) in the morning.  When schedules allow, we do 1.5 miles after work or more if we have time.  On most Saturday mornings I take him to trail nearby and we run.  Just let loose and fucking sprint a half a mile then calm down and run 3 miles.  When we do that first thing Saturday morning, he is an angel the rest of the weekend.  Seems to really help his mental state too.  He is naturally anxious and a bit fearful but that lets his mind rest and then with a properly exercised body he can totally relax.

If we skip a few days, all the bad behavior comes back and he doesn't listen to any commands or follow any house rules.  I am firm believer that dogs and kids (and adults for that matter) can't operate properly without regular cardio.  So, even if all you can get them is a 15 minute daily walk, I'm sure it would help.

Regarding the kennel, we have a kennel for each dog, but they are never put in there unless there is a good reason (need to calm down, stranger in the house like a repairman, or dinner time since my toddler loves to throw his food overboard from the high chair thus encouraging terrible begging habits).  The kennels are in the living room with the doors open all the time and my boys go in there when they want to.  One of them loves it and the other (the lab mix) ain't so convinced that it's cool. "

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389296513.0,"&gt;I feel a distinction between pure sexual desire of a woman and the feeling of intimacy, trust and feeling happy being around a certain person.

My rationale behind that is that you might be less motivated to find a partner in such a way. Sex is often an important bonding experience for people due to the release of oxytocin (among other neuromodulators) in the brain, and this facilitates the experience of love. 

So much of what we think and feel is influenced by hormones and neurotransmitters across the brain. I would put forth that if you masturbated 10 times prior to meeting someone that could be a potential lover, your perception of them could be skewed since you're not getting that base attraction and you might simply frame them as a friend. Your body is complacent because it doesn't feel the need to procreate after 10 orgasms in one day (and phew, what a day that would be)! You might be missing out on the opportunity, because you're not simulating that warm and fuzzy feeling, to find a lover.

&gt;I think high testosterone also might sometimes produces things as making out with someone while clubbing or one night stands you might regret the next day.

Possibly, but there are huge individual variations.

&gt;But we aren't saying masturbation is a replacement for sex in a relationship are we? :)

My concern is that some people do replace sex with masturbation, and these are the ""average person"". And what is the average person? I would say the majority of people you meet fit that, and there are plenty of people that are susceptible to things such a porn addiction, low sex drives, high sex drives, etc. The average person is such a fuzzy concept, I'm not sure I could argue against it.

So ultimately, it has the *potential* to damage relationships. I would say that masturbation is beneficial in the same way that sex is beneficial (although sex perhaps moreso due to the social benefits), but ultimately, it is something that should be done in moderation and not whenever someone feels like. You wouldn't tell someone to have a shot or eat a hamburger whenever they feel like, because if they did it truly at that rate it could become unhealthy."

Its more about skills, ambition and personality than it is about physical attractiveness. There are plenty of women out there that are both very physically appealing to me and are very skilled, and I definitely feel like I would have sex with them, but I would not want a relationship with them, and I would never make a move on them solely based upon that. 

For women that I am attracted to in general, first of all, no necessary physical attraction, I find those women that express intelligence, confidence and ambition are more attractive to me than those that can play an instrument, or are skilled at something. 

That being said, most women I have been attracted to have been art or english majors in college while I study physics and mathematics. "

majekmistake,kpop,1389296594.0,"I really liked Demion's debut, [Ask Her Out](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS4bnAqLYOU). I thought the song was really catchy and kinda cute without being overly aegyo drenched. Unfortunately, as much as I liked it, I couldn't help thinking that their group doesn't really have a lot to make them stand out in the crowd. They've got some good singers and good visuals and they dance well but so does every other rookie group. I'll be watching for them to put out more music but I think they need to step up in their game if they want to go anywhere in this industry.

Another 2013 rookie that I'm excited for is AlphaBAT. Their debut song, [AB City](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO3gf--ipCc) isn't very good but I'm sincerely hoping that this is going to be one of those cases where we all look back at their debut in a few years and collectively cringe and then laugh about how much better they've gotten since then. From the pre-debut covers they've posted ([TVXQ's Love in the Ice]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPKFwhoifhU), [Infinite's Nothing's Over](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd2c_7Jn5Zc), and [100%'s Bad Boy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xLaQYpOKrA)) it sounds like they've got a lot of really nice voices and their dancing is really on point so there is potential for them to do so much better than AB City. Also, I actually really like the lettering concept but I think their company is using it in the wrong way. They're making it really kitschy by just plastering it all over their clothes and making their songs about it when they could be using it to make their members easily identifiable and unique in the group. With the letters they've set up a structure where it's super easy to distinguish the members and while it's easy to match the faces with the letters they should be going on variety shows or putting out a reality show or even little youtube videos so we can put personalities to the letters as well. I think they'll do better if they fans can feel like they know them on a more personal basis."

Your body could be so sex driven that it is constantly trying to feed the motivation circuity for it *because* you masturbate frequently. Who knows? I certainly have a higher sex drive after not fapping and I agree it can be very distracting.

I think masturbating once a day isn't a problem unless you feel it is. Are you distressed by how much time you spend masturbating? If not, then who cares? Many of the people at /r/nofap seem to have a real problem with it, and I'm talking multiple times a day, hours spent looking at porn."

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389296852.0,"&gt; All human beings carry about a set of words which they employ to justify their actions, their beliefs, and their lives […] I shall call these words a person’s ‘final vocabulary.’ […] I shall define an ‘ironist’ as someone who fulfills three conditions: (1) She has radical and continuing doubts about the final vocabulary she currently uses, because she has been impressed by other vocabularies; (2) she realizes that argument phrased in her present vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts; (3) insofar as she philosophizes about her situation, she does not think that her vocabulary is closer to reality than others, that it is in touch with a power not herself.

&gt; The opposite of irony is common sense. For that is the watchword of those who unselfconsciously describe everything important in terms of the final vocabulary to which they and those around them are habituated. To be commonsensical is to take for granted that statements formulated in that final vocabulary suffice to describe and judge the beliefs, actions, and lives of those who employ alternative final vocabularies.

Land of the subjective, but the net I see is dominated by cat pics and their equivalents - where the majority of commentary isn't about serious matters.

Might be a bit weaker than first appearances, though, in that most of those commentators have probably had a stab at a political post or two (without having done the reading) - meaning that they could still be classified as ""ignorant idiots"".

Still, this place as a hub of contentiousness has it so far more people are willing to jump into the fray regardless of the chance of stuffing up.

Strikes me that even if you have a lower rate of serious posts that are incorrect, you're still going to have more ""ignorant idiots"" showing up per post than the general internet."

I *always* leave the inner limb/fade thick and static until later on in the tillering process because the inner limb is where a lot of the power in a bow comes from, and if it's damaged a lot of that power is lost.

In fact, it bothers you so much that I'm not feeding into your entitlement that you're doing the only thing you know how to do: threaten me. Nobody puts baby in the corner, right? 

Oh, you'll make a new account? Wonderful. Never heard that one before. 

Guess what: If you fuck up on the new one, I'll get rid of that one too. In the meantime, learn that ""No"" is a complete sentence and requires no justification. Alongside that, this attitude of yours is precisely why people like you don't need a safe space.

The space is to protect *us* from *you*. This behavior is pretty common with straight white cis people who are unaware of their entitlements and privilege."

On multiple occasions, I asked my team which league they were in (for statistics only, it's not as if league is a strict determination of skill) and there were _always_ at least two bronze leaguers and never another gold leaguer. 

When league first started, I played with and against a lot of great players. They played well and actually counterbuilt. I faced teams that purchased four Weakening Curses, and it was a challenge. Last season, though, I hardly ever encountered even one weakening curse, and the outcome of the game was literally the team without the guy who thought he could 1v5 throughout the entire game."

I would definitely take 6.5 or maybe even 7 inches over 5 inches though, if given the choice.

All of the above assume maximally firm erections. If a dick isn't fully rock hard, it doesn't matter how girthy it is...it doesn't *feel* thick unless it's very hard.

I never encountered a guy on eH that thought he was due anything. You can pay for eH in blocks of months and get reasonable discount. I paid for 6-months and met my husband at about the three-week mark. I feel like if you're sincere and want to actually have a relationship the likelihood that you'll meet someone appropriate is high enough that no one feels slighted (at least, I never encountered even one person with that mindset). I went out on several dates and even the one guy I didn't hit it off with at all was polite and respectful, just not for me.  

My thought-process going was, well, if you're paying for it it's less likely that you're going to be some troll who wants to send out abusive messages and dick pics. I figured they'd have a little more 'skin in the game' if you will. It takes about two or three hours to go through the personality questions and you can't contact people directly from the get-go because of the 'guided communication' feature. Another thing I really liked was that there was no browsing of profiles, either you're matched with each other or not (and if not, they can't see you). Plus, at least on eH I had a CS rep who would ban someone with a quickness if they got nasty (or if it turned out they were married or otherwise lied in their profiles). 

I think both views have their merits, and both sites worked for each of us in different ways, right? The same in terms of organic-ness (is that even a word?) being as they're essentially the same medium. I've been with my husband nearly six years now, married 5 years in July. "

I've only just started my second cycle using Clomid, but so far I have literally zero side effects, physically or emotionally. You are likely to start at 50mg, and your doctor will (hopefully) be very attentive to how it's affecting you. 

I know a lot of TTCers are kind of against prescription help (no problem with that--if you want it to happen naturally, that's your choice and I commend you). Personally, I wanted and welcomed all the help I could get. If it gets me a healthy baby sooner, I am willing to try it! Good luck!"

3. You found a more lucrative job, e.g. your dad gave you his surfboard shop.

4. You went to prison on drug charges.

For a long time I was able to ""manage"" with running and lifting weights, biking, etc but a time came when I couldn't stop thinking about wanting to die anyways and so I went on an SSRI. It's helped quite a lot, but I also know it only helps as much as it does because I'm also hitting the gym and doing a bit of therapy too. For some people, exercise is all they need to manage depression but for many others it's not quite enough.

13thmurder,AskReddit,1389297471.0,"At the store i used to work at as a cashier, there was a very strict rule about cashiers talking to each other... that being, that there would be none, ever. Unless it was absolutely necessary for the job, but then it had to be as quietly as possible, and as short as possible.

It was a large store, with only 4 cashiers at a time scheduled due to a limited number of cash registers. Also, all of the cashiers would stand behind one tiny counter together. There usually 5 managers on duty at any given time, since the store had 5 different sections, one managed each. 

Anyway, the managers really liked enforcing the no talking rule. If they even thought cashiers were talking to each other about something not 100% work related, they'd be over telling us off right away. Funny thing, these same managers would just stand around talking to each other all day, loudly, about completely inappropriate things. Usually they'd stand around blocking the lines for customers.

Even when the store was completely dead, it would be fully staffed, and if any of the cashiers said a word, a manager would be over telling us off.

I mean, of course no employer wants their employees talking to each other on the job, but still... i doubt most are all that strict about it, right?

It was however a seasonal job, which ended after a few months. Even though i worked with the same people almost every day, in the end they remained total strangers. It's really weird, how you can stand around with people for hours a day, just a few feet from each other, and work as a team with them, but still not know anything at all about them at the end of it.

Some of his basic tips? Smile. Remember people's names and say it (a person's name is their favorite word). Make eye contact.

Necron_Overlord,AskMen,1389297570.0,"&gt;To be fair, isn't it kind of unfair to treat her hostilely for being unavailable and unambiguous about that?

Depends.  There's one girl who comes down to the store regularly, whom I've talked to dozens of times, played against in three or four games, and still reminds me that she has a boyfriend *every single time I say hi to her*.  And I've played against *him* dozens of times.  

She acts like its suspicious that I remember her name and what armies she plays, which would be weird if I didn't remember the names and armies of every other regular.  As you might imagine, the fact that she doesn't bother to remember my name and treats me like I'm interested in her booty, when I'm just trying to treat her like a fucking member of the club, gets really aggravating.

I bet she whines on the internet about how she gets a hostile reception and its all a big boy's club, and never sees how she creates her own reality.

you don't understand economics period. 

The economy is not a algorithm, inflation is generated by individual prices, that are decided by living people, they will always seek maximum gratification trough their behavior, that being said lets do a hypothetical and lets hear what faults can you find in my reasoning.

if people get a bonus of 500$ they will spend 500$: Walmart will be sold out the first month, it will want to obtain larger margins, this can be done by:

- increasing stock, but this requires increased logistical costs, more spaces more trucks and so on.

- It can raise prices, but this might make them less attractive for consumers, but considering they already are the cheapest alternative and this option doesn't really cost anything; this is the measure they take for the next month

It's closest competitor, has the same dilemma regarding the volume of merchandise. But observes that Walmart increased prices, becoming a closer competitor to his price point, this makes previous Walmart clients potential clients to his company, so even higher sales are anticipated. This instantly calls for stoking on more products, it's a business no brainer. This as previously stated requires higher costs, but given the circumstances he can soak up the initial costs only by the increase in sales. His supplier however, needs to employ more men, and run more kilometers, and asks to renegotiate the contract. 

After a couple of months, the new terms include sufficient logistical support that the supermarket can sale continuously without being out of stock, but at a higher rate, as suppliers don't use economies of scale, more trucks require more costs. The only option for the supermarket chain is to raise prices appropriately, sure it won't attracted as much clients as Walmart but he still sales more than at the beggining of our tought experiment and now has a larger price point for each individual product sold, so his end of the year profits will be marginally better.

Now to dissect your word vomit:

&gt;There is no reason to think that switching from means tested welfare and tax credits to a basic income scheme would cause an inflation shock.

Yes there is, an increase in monetary volume dispels its value.

&gt;We have high unemployment, low inflation and a MASSIVE amount of excess reserves in the banking system. All this points to that in the short term, the Fed couldn't cause hyperinflation even if it tried because 4 years after the recession we are still in an economy held back by weak demand.

First off, you have an adequate level of unemployment, Spain has high unemployment. 

Secondly:excess reserves=less monetary volume in circulation=low inflation

The main point of the fed is to keep inflation under raps because of your highly open economy. If the dollar plummets things would get expensive really fast. Also, most deposits in your currency would be liquidated, and that would be a growth in monetary volume that would make any monetarist wet the bed.

&gt;Well what happens if the inflation actually is large? Then the federal reserve will end quantitative easing and start selling bonds to lower the inflation rate and take money out of the system. We will simply no longer be in a weak economy hovering at the zero-bound interest rate anymore.

Ending QE will only make state borrowing more expensive. If the fed where to sell in parallel, its state bonds, as you are suggesting, it would only lower their value, why buy state issued bonds when the fed is selling them at loss just to decrease monetary volume. But don't worry, although our economic overlords aren't smart they also aren't that stupid.

&gt;When a certain group is increasing its nominal income faster than everyone else then they will 4x always as long as 2+2=4 always see a real increase income regardless of what happens to prices and inflation.

Income=/value

&gt;In short, people who admonish the threats of inflation seem as in touch with economic reality as those who a crying for a gold standard.

 all of the above prooves you are so knowledgeable, you invented a completely new branch of economics, I recommend calling it kinda-economics"
bosh-head,TwoXChromosomes,1389297648.0,"Well I suppose it's okay to do a lot of things for silly reasons. Things that are rather inconsequential, things that aren't going to have a harmful impact on the lives of others. The problem comes when your actions have serious effects on the lives of people, or when you think your reasons are good but they actually are not.

If you believe that god wants us to dress a certain way, then you end up segregating the world into people who dress that way and people who don't, which is equivalent to people who are doing what god wants, and people who are not.

Causing these sorts of divisions in humanity over fictional stories is not a good way to promote a world in which we can live together happily &amp; harmoniously."

AnimusHerb240,occult,1389297916.0,"Karma is simply cause and effect playing out, but the catch is that there are so many nuanced avenues for cause and effect to play out (of which we are not normally cognizant) that the trends may seem almost mystical, in a way. There is nothing mystical or supernatural about it, rather more statistical.

If you lie, you carry the burden of having told an untruth, and that will manifest in your life in some way. It's like setting a little 1-microgram weight on a scale...there are measurable repercussions. Again, there is no good and there is no bad.

If there are things in your past for which you feel any certain flavor of shame, that shame retains a presence within your sphere of influence and will play itself out in the way you carry yourself, in the vocabulary you use, in the company you decide to keep, in the way you take care of yourself and your life affairs.

I think a great example of karma is the effect industrialization has had on our planet's ecosystem. If there are less trees, there is less oxygen and more carbon dioxide. Cause and effect. ""Good"" and ""bad"" never come into it. It isn't ""bad"" if our whole planet catches on fire and cracks in half, that's just what it will have done if it does that.

Another good system that shows how karma plays out is within family dynamics. Secrets of the parents, repression of life aspirations among them, too...family history of abuse, shame, and gender roles imprinted on the parents...these things ***WILL*** manifest in the burgeoning personality of children raised in that environment. We can't really ever ""keep a secret"" in the way we think we can...avoiding the consequences of information by hiding it from relevant parties. The secrecy just changes the way the information takes place, makes it toxic and convoluted, in a way.

Within a finite system, all actions play out with equal and opposite reactions just like our laws of physics tell us, even emotionally/mentally/socially."

A Calvin and Hobbes CGI bullshit, like they did with Garfield, the Smurfs and others.

It will most likely involve some bullshit adventure to save Calvin's dad's job or to stop some bullies at school or some other shit like that. Hobbes will be defined as a real tiger that has some magical powers that turn him into some stuffed doll, and he can only turn real if people use the power of imagination and friendship. There will be a lot of overly corny jokes and absolutely none of the witty charm the comics had, because they need to tone that shit down for the kids. The movie will end with the family realizing Hobbes is real and having him as a member of their family and having a big fucking family friendly supper together. And before the credits, Calvin and Hobbes will do something wacky, and Calvin's mom will scream ""CALVIIIIIIIIN!"" and Hollywood will get money and every fan of the comic will collectively suicide.

DrinkyDrank,TumblrInAction,1389298266.0,"I have my own issues with academia.  How about this?

Academic feminism means:

*  Finding real problems and abstracting them until they are meaningless bullshit in order to maintain a relatively comfortable first-world/middle-class life.
*  Arguing with fellow academics about said meaningless bullshit.
*  Generally fulfilling one's own distorted and contradicting self-image as both victim of the 'privileged' and savior of women everywhere.

Like you said, it's pretty similar.  I would just point out that when I was in college studying political theory, a lot of the self-proclaimed feminists in my class were very open-minded and flexible with what feminism meant to them and how they would apply it in their lives.  All of those authors you listed contradict and argue with each other about what feminism is or should be, as academics are wont to do.  It makes sense that a younger generation, that didn't grow up in the 60's and 70's, would adapt their values so that they make sense in world that has gotten better (relatively) at treating women as equals.

RJ815,truegaming,1389298410.0,"Really? Do you know which games specifically caused that? I mean, it could be that I just have limited reference pools and missed out, but the JRPGs (and just more modern Japanese games in general) I've seen tend to be more repetitive and handhold-y than the WRPGs I've seen, but then again there is the whole Tolkein-esque trend and WoW clones in the West too, though I feel like that came after JRPGs got influenced by one or both of those trends according to you.

There are definitely some JRPGs that I like, usually the turn-based combat ones as mentioned before, but JRPGs as a genre (especially with the likes of Final Fantasy post-X and certainly post-XIII) seem to have lost any real sense of popularity in the West due to being too easy/boring and patronizing for Western audiences. It's also really weird because Japanese games used to be known for being insanely hard, yet now the popular perception (whether it's accurate or not) is that they're far easier and repetitive and patronizing and have ""no player left behind"". Maybe it's just a matter of Westerners seeing a mix of good and bad with their own native games whereas very little Japanese stuff actually gets localized and the bad style might seem more memorable."

I also have a cheap plastic vibe that gyrates (very low frequency, powerful vibrations). It is ribbed and I think it was called 'the thumper'. I have tried to replace it with a higher end gyrator but can't seem to find any with the same kind of vibrations. This is actually my favourite vibe ever.

Excellent point. In other cities up north where they do plow the side streets I have seen entire blocks of parked cars literally buried up to the luggage racks in plowed snow. There aren't enough teenagers or $20 bills to go around for that kind of problem.

I have no trouble at all driving on, or parking on, packed snow (I drive a fwd sedan) as long as it's more or less even. I have been driving all over south city, including the Hill, the last few days and it's not difficult, but there is a learning curve.

Generally, while playing a game, you aren't multitasking, and games are still largely built for 32-bit, which means they can't use more than 4 GB anyway.  Given that Windows, by itself, only uses 1 GB or so, you're not really going to use more than 5 GB or so while gaming.  I still like to recommend 8 or 16 GB; RAM is cheap, and it future-proofs the system a bit.

FWIW, I don't think 32 GB is ridiculous either, I can see a bunch of plugins and software synths on a big project eating that much.  I'm also preparing to add RAM to a bunch of servers that currently have 96 GB each, though, so you may want to take my thoughts on RAM with a grain of salt."

almightybob1,bestof,1389298716.0,"That is not what /r/fatpeoplestories is about.

FPS is not about fat people. It is about fat people *who expect the rest of the world to cater to their fatness* and/or *who display incredible self-delusion and logic-wrangling to justify their lifestyle*.

A fat person has three choices:

1) Try to get healthy.

2) Don't try to get healthy.

3) Try to change the world and redefine ""healthy"" so that they are considered healthy.

If someone chooses option 1), they are inundated with support and encouragement. Check out any of the Fat2Fit stories in the sub for examples.

If someone chooses option 2), well fine. If they want to stay overweight and are prepared to accept the consequences of that, fair play it's their choice.

FPS exchanges stories about and mocks the ones who choose 3).

Nobody can make a fat person change their life. Not through encouragement, not through shame. Only the person themselves can do that. Trying to pass it off as ""society shamed me"" is a convenient excuse, but at the end of the day the responsibility for a person's health lies with that person, not with society. Their choices will determine what happens to them. FPS is a reaction to an increasingly popular route people choose."

hurston,childfree,1389298758.0,"I have had more than glares of disappointment, but this has had the opposite effect on me, it makes me dislike children more. Liking other peoples kids but not want any yourself is the result of a moderate nurturing instinct. Like the mating instinct, the nurturing instinct is a broad scale rather than black and white.

Regarding your flip side, and referencing my comment above about the nurturing instinct being a scale rather than black and white, there are many people who have relatively low levels of the nurturing instinct who in the past would have had kids due to social pressures but now have the choice not to. I agree that for these people the biological imperative is weak, because all people do not have the same level of hormones, just as they people have different levels of testosterone and oestrogen to drive the mating instinct. Everyone is not biologically the same.

Finally, why do you think it is called the nurturing instinct rather than the nurturing decision? I agree we are not going to be changing eachothers minds though."

If person A and person B walk into a room and person B starts freaking out and refuses to talk to person A and wants to leave, according to your definition of prejudice person B is in the wrong. Why would they randomly do something like that just because of some arbitrary factor of person A's appearance or personality?

But then if you look at the situation in context and find out that person A belongs to a group of people that has systematically abused people like person B, that reaction starts to make a lot more sense. They react negatively to that person not because they are arbitrarily deciding that they don't like them, but because history and lived experience has taught them that being around that person will likely result in bad things happening. It will cause them stress, as well as the potential for physical harm or even death, with little consequences for person A.

To conclude, kids on a reservation not wanting to play with the white children which might hurt their feelings is in no way comparable to the systematic genocide which has been perpetuated against native peoples in the Americas for the last 500+ years."

JoshuatheHutt,environment,1389298922.0,"I like how so many people are calling for a ""cull"" of the human population or to limit births, as if this doesn't happen naturally. 

Birth rates drop once a population, particularly mothers, become educated. The population moves from a subsistence economy to a more modern one. Families don't have to have so many kids to work the land and feed themselves, so they start to invest resources into 2-3 children. 

People are also failing to recognize a positive side effect of having large populations, especially an educated one. We have more smart people solving problems today than ever before who are innovating new technologies. 

The planet will max out around 9 to 11 billion people. To feed them we need to go after the low hanging fruit that is wasted food (upwards of 50% of food ends up in the trash in the US). Innovative technologies, permaculture practices, and cheap green energy will take care of the rest. 

We won't have to artificial limit our population, especially if we take the time and money to invest in educating the populations that are still experiencing high birth rates. "

My bf was nervous when I went off my bc pills and wanted to switch to the withdrawal method. But we had a talk about what I would do if I got pregnant, and since he knows I am absolutely certain that I would get an abortion, it has set his mind at ease.

Also, does she specifically want you to come inside her, or does she just not like condoms? Because you could also pull out rather than using a condom, if you think you have the necessary self-control to do that properly.

In general, if you trust her to take the bc pill at the same time every day, and never miss or throw up a pill without telling you, then you should feel confident in using the pill alone. If she is the forgetful type or you don't trust her or just want a method that is in your control, then by all means use condoms.

bosh-head,TwoXChromosomes,1389299166.0,"I think they obviously hold to an idea that says women have a special obligation to be modest, and that idea is itself morally wrong.

How do they view people who don't subscribe to their ideas? That's going to vary on an individual level, but if they say they don't at least view those people as doing something *wrong*, as doing something that is against God's wishes, then they are not being logically consistent.

I wouldn't at all be surprised for them to try to claim that however, we see religious people adopt this attitude all the time. That is a concession that religious people have been forced to make in modern society. They've had to concede, even though there's no way to logically square it with their beliefs, that it's perfectly okay for *other* people to do things that are against God's wishes. 

The strength of this concession, or whether it exists at all, can vary issue by issue and by region. 

(Is it okay to say gay people are sinful? Most still say yes, but in some circles that will get you in trouble, and I expect that to be increasingly the case. Is it okay to say black people are black because of the curse of Ham? Well, that used to be a Mormon tenet, but they had to revise that, and no one could get away with holding that belief without being considered a racist today.)

There's no getting around the fact that if god really wants women to cover their hair (or their entire bodies), then women who don't do so are wrong. There's no getting around that logically, at least. And that's part of the reason why I criticize those who hold that belief."

* Where were you born? **Orange County, CA. Yep. The OC. It really is embarrassing when people call it that, though.**
* What languages do you speak? **I speak enough Spanish to get by, and in a pinch, I can muddle my Spanish enough to pass it off as really bad Brazilian Portuguese. Otherwise, just English.**
* What is your ethnic heritage? **My dad is from El Salvador and my mom is mixed Irish-Italian. I'm pretty much a mutt.**
* What is your Favorite Disney movie? **I think my favorite Disney movie would have to beeeeee.... Aladdin.**
* Who is your favorite author? **George Orwell. Brilliant.**
* What is the most beautiful place you've ever been? **The Pelhourinho in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. It's the historical district of Bahia, and the former capitol of Brazil, and it's incredibly charming with stone paved roads and Easter colored buildings stacked side by side.**
* What is the band/song you can listen to all day long? **Probably Daft Punk. I do that most days, anyway (but it's just so good for staying productive!)**
* What would be your last meal? **Ethiopian. Doro tibs. OM NOM NOM.**
* What is your favorite animal? **Zebras are pretty amazing. Have you ever heard the sound they make? It's like a hybrid of a horse whinny, dolphin chatter, and magic.**

* Who is your biggest fictional crush? **My biggest fictional crush. Oh my my my. Probably Jesse from Pitch Perfect. Such a cheeseball, but it's pretty darn cute.**
* Who is your favorite artist? **Edgar Degas. I think it's because I'd always wanted to learn ballet, but my parents could never afford it, so I've resigned myself to appreciating it from afar.**
* What is something you are afraid of? **Spiders are a very recent/new fear, but otherwise, I think it's just normal parent fears like my son being hurt or lost or him losing me.**
* What is your favorite memory from this past year? **My favorite memory of the past year would have to be the night my boyfriend, son, and I picked out a Christmas tree. It was the first time they'd ever really spent time together and the way they connected was amazing. I'd never experienced that in my previous relationship, and it just made me love my boyfriend that much more.**
* What are you looking forward to in 2014? **Helping my son grow and further develop, developing my new blog, getting my finances under control!**
**What was the last TV series you binged on? OR if you're not a Netflix binger, what is your favorite series?**

All the stuff people return because they are too stupid to figure out how to work it (like expensive accessories and such), then return it claiming it is 'defective', goes straight into what they call 'field destroy'. It has a special tag assigned to it, and then gets thrown in a bin in the back room until it is full. All the old strategy guides that haven't sold after a while get 'pennied out', which means, they are still in the system, but are marked down to a penny in price, and then manually taken out and put in the same field destroy box. When the time comes to get rid of it, the district manager is supposed to come and destroy the stuff. All strategy guides get the front cover ripped up so you can't resell it. If your manager is cool, sometimes they'll let you take them home before they're destroyed. I got loooooooooots of free stuff this way when I worked there. 


**Edit: also, many chain stores like Target, Walmart, stuff like that, do the same thing. But they send it to 'recycling' places to be destroyed. Most places will flip the stuff for profit though, because quite frankly, it still works perfectly, but has been opened, so can't be resold as new. "

EOverM,worldbuilding,1389299293.0,"I've decided on a way the universe is structured that is reasonable, and has no current evidence that says it isn't that way.  Namely, that spacetime is quantised - we don't yet know if it's continuous or not, so who's to say it's not made up of discrete chunks?  Crossing the boundaries between quanta (which is something that every single piece of matter in existence does at all times, as the quanta are smaller than all matter can be) takes energy, which manifests as ""hyperfriction"" - it's responsible for the lightspeed limit and inertia, among other things.  Specifically, though, it reacts to acceleration across the boundaries.  Inertia comes from objects ""sliding"" along the ""edges"" of the quanta, thereby continuing forever without slowing - changing direction or speed requires acceleration across boundaries, and therefore an input of energy.

Now imagine that you can pull space apart at the boundaries.  What's between them?  Well, higher-dimensional space.  In the same way that punching a hole in a folded piece of paper gives access to the other side through the third dimension, punching a hole in fourth-dimensional spacetime gives access to a fifth.  There are dozens of FTL technologies in use in the galaxy, and all use this feature of spacetime in a slightly different way - not all accessing the same fifth dimension.  Different techs utilise different dimensions with different properties - some allow travel at a velocity far greater than light (no hyperfriction), some afford zero-length distances between two points in the fourth-dimensional universe, others are simply much shorter distances, allowing sublight travel to take a far shorter time.

Ultimately I've tried to avoid something that will sound ridiculous when it's eventually disproven - the technologies are all reasonable, based on a single concept.  If that concept turns out to be untrue, then fine - the story's just set in an alternate universe where that *is* the case."

Arrange for him to see your boys, and maybe tell the boys it's time for a ""full physical"" or something like that. I'd say a male dr would probly be better than a female one, just for comfort. When the dr checks them out, if they do have micropenis or something he can discuss with them what that means, and maybe even have a puberty talk with the older one. Heck maybe the 8 yr old too.

potato1,TwoXChromosomes,1389299558.0,"&gt; I think they obviously hold to an idea that says women have a special obligation to be modest, and that idea is itself morally wrong.

That's not true of individuals. I have friends who wear hijab because it says to do so in the qu'ran, not because they believe that women need to be modest. Modesty is one possible reason why someone would instruct them to wear hijab, but it is not the only possible reason (another would be because hijab will protect their hair and/or skin from potentially cancer-causing sun damage). Just like I'm sure some muslim men grow beards because it says to do so, not because they believe that men need to hide their chins or for any other reason going beyond that.

&gt;How do they view people who don't subscribe to their ideas? That's going to vary on an individual level, but if they say they don't at least view those people as doing something wrong, as doing something that is against God's wishes, then they are not being logically consistent.

&gt;I wouldn't at all be surprised for them to try to claim that however, we see religious people adopt this attitude all the time. That is a concession that religious people have been forced to make in modern society. They've had to concede, even though there's no way to logically square it with their beliefs, that it's perfectly okay for other people to do things that are against God's wishes.

Not all religious sects believe that those who do not follow their rules are doing something ""against God's wishes."" Jews, for instance, do not believe that gentiles need to keep kosher or wear kippah.

&gt;(Is it okay to say gay people are sinful? Most still say yes, but in some circles that will get you in trouble, and I expect that to be increasingly the case. Is it okay to say black people are black because of the curse of Ham? Well, that used to be a Mormon tenet, but they had to revise that, and no one could get away with holding that belief without being considered a racist today.)

It sounds to me like you don't believe the revelation changing the church's stance on black membership was genuine. Is that so?"

You seem confused. On one had you seem to think people can behave perfectly if only they were communist, but at the same time hate how selfish ""capitalists"" are. There is no such this as a communist state where people have justice (I assume you care nothing of freedom). I mean I must be wrong things are so much worse now than they were even 50 years ago (never mind, violence, poverty, famine, disease or life expectancy). Communism and socialism never work because people like you think you know what's best for everyone else, and anyone who disagrees with you is a subversive to be locked up. Maybe when you grow up (and have things to worry about long after your dead) you'll realize their is no easy answer, and most people want to be left to live their lives without your ideas of what justice is. 

Edit: and don't mistake charity for philanthropy, they are similar but not entirely the same.

HalfysReddit,TwoXChromosomes,1389299722.0,"I really think this is one of those things that simply can't be argued one way or the other with any amount of certainty. There's so many factors to consider, and each individual experiences reality through their own mind.

For example, women are often dismissed as candidates in male-dominated fields. Just for simplicity's sake, let's narrow this speculation down to the field of firefighting. So, women aren't given the same immediate respect men are when pursuing a career in firefighting. Is that sexist? Yes. Is that wrong? Yes. How much of an affect does this have on the collective quality of life experienced by women everywhere? *Who the fuck knows?*

No one can tell you with any amount of certainty what numbers of women would be firefighters today if sexism just didn't exist. No one can tell you with any amount of certainty the difference in quality of life these women would experience in that alternate reality.

Now I know the scope of this argument is very limited, but the same phenomena can be applied to any form of prejudice experienced by any group of people. The best we can do is speculate about the expected differences in quality of life. And to dismiss someone as an ally for freedom because their speculations don't line up *exactly* with yours, even though the both of you have the same end goals, is just petty IMO."

As a fan of the franchise I can tell you that it is a faithful adaptation of the old games that attempts to keep the overall experience and feeling of the game. I like it overall, with the caveat that the game could of been even better had it kept a bit more of the old school XCOM featureset.

Many feminists I know are housewives, are happily married and are very good at cooking, cleaning sewing etc. Feminism is supposed to be about having the freedom to do what you want to do, to have your thoughts and opinions matter as a person and not have to have society's permission to live your life. If that means society has a problem with you cooking and cleaning and staying home with the kids, fuck em. Do what makes you happy as a person, not what society expects you to do as a woman.

Normally I'm anti-strippers / strip clubs because unless you know what you're doing, you just end up with an empty wallet and blue balls. For a bachelor party it's a lot of fun though. So yes.

&gt;Alcohol?

Should be a given.

&gt;Drugs (hard or soft)?

Depends on the kind of crew you roll with. Both kind are fun in the right hands.

&gt;Club/Dancing?

I don't have a problem with clubs but might not the best idea for a bachelor party unless you're gonna ball out and order expense bottle service and all that shit. Bachelor parties should be a ""guys"" night, not a night where your friends are missing because they're trying to get laid.

&gt;Poker game with the guys?

Would be a solid pregame

&gt;Lazer tag?

Eh kind of kiddy but could be fun as hell if you're fucked up

&gt;How open/honest would you be with your SO? 

Don't have one so N/A

I think a bachelor party is like most nights out. You can plan it perfectly and have the best night on paper, but what's really going to make it fun and memorable are the guys you go with and making your own fun.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1389300089.0,"The problem with this isn't the idea that we shouldn't be looking for ways to eliminate work, it's that it's so divorced from the consequences of libertarian ideology and super unrealistic. It rings of the same old ""well we should be free and not be weighed down by duties and crap!"" angsty libertarians always like to go on about.

The thing is, this article is unknowingly divorced from the core of libertarian ideology, which states that while you are technically free to not work, if you want to not starve you have to work because otherwise you're stealing from workers. 

If you're gonna develop a society without work...you need to...well...work at it. It has to drift that way, trend that way, and it'll never happen under a system of unregulated capitalism, which libertarians are a big fan of, and is very work centric. You need dirty statist ideas like basic income to give people a viable alternative, combined with extensive use of technology that can do the labor we otherwise would have to do ourselves. Until we have the technology to free us from menial work, and until we have the social structures (which are only gonna be accomplished via government intervention or ""force"") to allow people to make a living without working, which is never gonna happen under a libertarian ideology, we can't eliminate work. Even with these things, we will still need work...we'll just need a lot less work where we might only see labor participation rates around 20% as opposed to the 50-60 we have today.

So I have to chalk this up to more libertarians being in lala-land. While I think the minimization of work is a worthy goal, it CAN'T happen under an unregulated capitalist system that libertarians value. The idea is essentially unlibertarian, because they're still in the ""if you don't work you don't deserve to eat"" mentality. Heck, this is a major reason I so vehemently oppose libertarian ideology...because we can work toward accomplishing these things today in a modern post industrial society, while unregulated capitalism just leads to a life of people working super long hours for super low pay. A libertarian lifestyle is a race with no finish line, where no matter how much we produce, no matter how successful we become, people will forever be enslaved because they will always have to work for mere survival while those they work for just get richer and richer. It's a reduction to serfdom, not a path to TRUE freedom. I left libertarianism, quite frankly, not because I'm anti liberty, but that libertarianism doesn't guarantee TRUE liberty for most people."

`TO ALL CONGREGATIONS`

`Re: Adjustments to Draw Close to Jehovah`

`Dear Brothers:`

`Some changes involving our understanding of the meaning of God’s name and what it represents
have been made to the first chapter of Draw Close to Jehovah. Because this book will be
studied at the Congregation Bible Study beginning the week of January 6, 2014, arrangements have
been made to update the text in the digital formats that are available on jw.org by December 31,
2013. Updated files in the EPUB, HTML, MOBI (Amazon Kindle), PDF, and Watchtower
ONLINE LIBRARY formats will be released simultaneously. The audio recording of chapter 1
also will be redone and released at the same time. If the updated chapter is available in the language
of your congregation, the brothers assigned to conduct or read for the Congregation Bible
Study should be sure to use the latest text. Check the publishers’ page for the words “December
2013 Printing” to ensure that you have the latest text. This appears in all electronic copies except
the HTML format.
At times, you may notice that the text of publications on jw.org does not match what is in
a printed copy of the same publication. Reprinting publications to include updated information
can take months or even years. However, the copies on jw.org can be updated more quickly.
Therefore, the publication on jw.org will always contain the most up-to-date version of the text.
Printed copies of the book Draw Close to Jehovah that contain the aforementioned changes will
not be available before the book is studied in the congregations. Therefore, do not request a new
printed copy in expectation that it will contain the updated information.
We are pleased to have the means to make these updates available to you quickly so you can
benefit by having the updated understanding available when you study this material.—Prov. 4:18.`

`Be assured of our warm love and best wishes.`

`Your brothers,`

`cc: Traveling overseers`

`PS to coordinator of the body of elders:`

`Since this matter is time sensitive, please arrange for this letter to be read to the congregation
at the first Service Meeting or Watchtower Study after its receipt. Thereafter, it should be
posted on the information board.`"

Do you believe that the revelation was genuinely believed?

&gt;Then they are ignorant of their own religion. The reason for doing it is spelled out in the text itself, and it is modesty.

First of all, the qur'an instructs both men and women to dress and behave modestly. Second of all, I would hope that you're aware that many religious texts are widely regarded by followers as not intended to be read literally."

I make sure to get a turret up if they are going gas heavy or I cant figure out what they are doing. With the starport proxied there isn't enough time to get vikings/ravens back home if they banshee rush as well.

Come to think of it, my Samsung smartphone has the company logo on the face and I also think that's annoying...as a designer, I constantly think about it and look at it and think that.  Apple doesn't do that, they only do it on the back of the device (Also not a fan of ""MacBook x"" under the screens of Apple Laptops).  As a Casio watch fan, I've always thought there's too much unnecessary typeface clutter as well (e.g., ""Illuminator"", ""Multilingual"", ""Data Bank"", ""Pro Trek"", ""Triple Sensor"", etc.).

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1389300514.0,"About a year and a half ago I got into smoking this fake weed shit. XLR-11 to be precise. You don't want none of this  - this shit is **bad news**.

Anyways I got *too* into smoking it. I was getting fucked up every hour that I wasn't at work. I got into two car accidents because I was fucked up. I lost a shit ton of weight because I was fucked up. My family couldn't reach me for like three weeks because I was fucked up.

Addiction ain't no joke.

Anyways, cut to the day I decided I had to quit this shit *real soon* before I ended up killing myself. I locked the door to my room and turned off my cell phone. I then proceeded to withdraw, and experienced a more intense hell than anything reality could ever offer me.

In terms of just physical pain, I would have rather had my skin boiled. Before this event I had no idea the human mind *could* experience such levels of pain. Aside from that, I was terrified for no reason, I sobbed like no grown ass man should ever need to, I puked. I had no idea if I was going to die or not. I had no idea if I was ever going to feel sane again. And I couldn't even ask anybody for help because I was an idiot and got fucked up on research chemicals. I still have no idea what I've done to myself. It's entirely possible I'l just drop dead in a few years from sort of delayed aneurysm or some such.

The withdrawal, or at least the intense and painful part of it, lasted four days. Then it was about three months of minor psychosis. Followed by chronic anxiety that I still deal with to this day.

But yea the hardest part of my life was experiencing my own personal hell and thinking about the fact that this was how my mother was going to find the corpse of her dead son.

The burden is not on me, but on the one making the claim. What I know is that no sufficient evidence for the existence of god has ever been publicly presented.

I can't prove that god doesn't exist, but I can assert that there's no good reason for believing that god exists that have been publicly presented (and therefore, no good reason to be following these religious beliefs we're discussing).

The claim is that god exists (or that certain religious beliefs are justified). That claim is the one I'm rejecting. The burden is on those making the claim to demonstrate it.

In practice, when there's no good reason to believe something is true, we simply regard it as false (even if we can't prove that it's false). In practice, we should treat religious beliefs as false.

&gt; Second of all, I would hope that you're aware that many religious texts are widely regarded by followers as not intended to be read literally.

For example, if you look at substance abuse, a lot of communities will just push ""don't drink"" and then have the community backing that.  If the big issues don't go away and someone has an addictive personality and shifts to addiction to porn or shopping or whatever else, that's fine because it's not drinking.

Basically I think a lot of addiction communities miss the bigger picture problems.  It is most likely helpful for some, but a good chunk of people just shift addictions rather than working on the underlying issues of addiction.

The proposed predominance of 'A' lattice microtubules, more suitable for information processing, has been falsified by Kikkawa et al.,[37][38] who showed that all in vivo microtubules have a 'B' lattice and a seam.

Yes he makes a good point about people having to be patient, but to be honest most fans **are** still getting behind the team. I've barely seen anyone not support the team, you can complain about some decisions and still be supporting the team.



It's the same logic that the ""There's starving kids in Africa"" argument is based on.

Just because you have to watch watch shite football and haven't seen the success that we have, doesn't mean we aren't well within our rights to complain when we see such a sharp decline.

Very few people ""aren't getting behind the team"" people are however, having a little moan and trying to get to the bottom of whats wrong.

I mean Christ imagine if this happened at any other club. I think our fans have handled it particularly well. Moyes would have been hounded out by most other teams fans after the results we've had, including fucking Newcastle's I'd guess. But no the large majority are getting behind the team and willing them to succeed by supporting the team.

Granted, I didn't marry my abuser. So we have that difference.

The first time he kicked me was four months into dating. I was shocked. He'd yelled at me before, but that was the first time he physically lashed out. But he was still so sweet, and was always so good at apologizing and making me realize that he didn't mean to hurt me or scare me.

Besides, he was really stressed about getting a job. He was under a lot of pressure. Normally he wasn't like this.

It was sporadic at first. Then his outbursts would become a weekly thing. I remember one time he was texting me while I was out of town, telling me that I couldn't make him happy anymore. I felt like shit. I realized that I had felt the same way last weekend as well, for the same reason.

As forgiving became easier (because he's under so much stress, and I'm certainly not helping by being so stupid anyways) so did the outbursts. Every other day. Every day. Multiple times a day. I learned later that there's generally [a pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cycle_of_Abuse.png) in a abusive relationship. We were almost always at ""incident"". Our honeymoon phases of happiness and forgiving started to only last hours, and I lived for them. They seemed to be the only times we could be happy. When I'm in a joking mood with my friends nowadays I tell them that we got along best when we were sleeping. It's not a lie though.

After a while he stopped bothering to apologize. Why should he? I was always making him angry- he was depressed and I was his girlfriend. I'm the one who's supposed to make him happy. If I can't even do that, he has every right to be angry at me, doesn't he? I just needed to be better. If I wasn't so stupid, so embarrassingly incompetent, he wouldn't have to yell at me, or tell me how much I was messing up. He'd always give me warnings that I needed to act fast to make him happy- he'd grab the sides of my back and pinch them. He'd glare at me. These were signs that I had about thirty seconds to make him laugh. Not smile, laugh. If I didn't, my day was going to be miserable. But he's pretty considerate; he would warn me.

If I could calm him down early in the day, that just meant I was safe for that moment. But anything could switch him off, and the countdown would start again. 90% of the time -probably more than that- I couldn't make him happy quickly enough.

But it was my fault. Because I wasn't doing anything well enough, and I was already making things worse by just being around. Except he wanted me around, as awful as I was. When I'd try to leave, he'd convince me he'd treat me better. Then I'd come back, in the sun of our fifteen minute honeymoon (sometimes not even that) and then deal with his rage all over again.

My ex was never as violent as yours was- he preferred verbal abuse as opposed to physical, although sometimes he threw drumsticks by my head because he was frustrated while practicing and I was being annoying by sitting there and watching him like he wanted. But I deserved that too.

Oh yeah, another big difference between our partners is that when I told mine I thought he was abusive, he pushed me out of the hammock we were lying in together onto the ground. In his defense, I should have known better and told him how kind he is instead. I loved him so much, enough that I would have given my life for him if I thought it would have made him happy. And when he was happy... God, those few moments when he was laughing and smiling were the highlights of my day. When something good happened to him (not me; good things that happened to me were generally boring) and he's kiss me out of delight... I was ecstatic. 

The entire relationship after the 4th month was spent trying to recreate the first three. Know why? Because those first three months... they were amazing. We were both always happy, always wanting to be together. It was great. I'd never been happier before those three months.

Then I ruined it by being so stupid and inadequate. By not doing what he said. By heavy stepping when I should have walked on eggshells. By not saying things he wanted me to say.

That was three years ago and I'm still dealing with the psychological consequences of him being in my life. Still.

I hope you stop being me. Because he's not going to stop being him. Abusers don't reform, they're just great at promising they will.

Please, PM me if you'd like to keep talking, even if you end up staying with him. "

I'll never trade that Beartic since he's a ""true"" shiny, one I found by myself. She has some sentimental value attached to her.

If you say SVExchange defeated the allure of them being rare, you should say the same thing about fishing shinies and the PokeRadar. Why not the Masuda Method too ? Lots of people hunt for shinies and amass a considerable amount of them. Are they less rare ?

Sure, Instacheck and SVExchange might have provided easy shinies. But I appreciate every shinies I've got this way."

SO's should know what the general plan is.  You don't want drama if they find out a secret, and you don't want the guy to feel guilty or inhibited.

You can expand from there depending on budget to a road trip or getaway location, but the essentials in my book are male bonding, good food/booze, naked women.  It is a bacchanal event, and should be enjoyed as such.

Kaisharga,DnD,1389300994.0,"It should also be mentioned that in addition to everyone's Second Wind, usable once per combat, and Leaders' healing powers (usually also limited number of uses in any given combat), you can spend your healing surges in between battles to heal up wounds without expending a power. And since your healing surges themselves don't replenish until the next day, this becomes a limit on how many fights you can get into and still survive before a proper night's rest.

So Second Wind is a way to make parties without a dedicated healer feasible, Leaders have encounter powers that heal with bonuses so it's still useful to have a healer in the party, and the number of surges you get--dictated by your class--sets the timer for how much trouble you can get into in a given day...instead of ""well I guess the healer ran out of spells to cast today,"" it's, ""okay, are we all still okay on surges?

DuckyFreeman,explainlikeimfive,1389301041.0,"I'm all for gender equality, but it doesn't apply here in the modern sense. Modern gender equality is the result of building a society that allows couples to eschew ancient gender roles. As ancient nomadic tribes, someone had to go get the food while someone stayed back to raise the children, maintain the living quarters, and prepare much of the survival equipment. Hunting can be agreed to be the more dangerous of the two roles, leading to a requirement for more strength and endurance. That does not mean that it was more important than the womans role. The need to cook, clean, and raise children led to other advantages that women still have. Things like better smell (to tell if the food is bad), the ability to better listen to multiple things (you need to hear the baby and the wolf in the woods), more fat storage (to feed babies), I'm sure even women's apparent creativity and artistic drive could be linked back to the need to create effective clothing and shelters. 

In short, humans have survived because of our ability to create societies and work together. That requires an effective division of force that has led to the genders receiving a certain amount of specialization. Neither role is more important than the other, as the village would collapse without both. It's very much possible to be different, but equal."

Our world is ingrained with social norms and instinctual tendencies.  However that doesn't mean its right or wrong.  It's just how things are.  That shouldn't affect how you choose to live your life.  Honestly I choose to follow the unbeaten path as it's more fulfilling to me.

I believe its okay for us to live towards self discovery.  It's a choice ours to make, it doesn't make one greater or lesser than anyone else.  It's our life and we can choose how to experience it.   We fret and worry so much that we forget how to be grateful for being alive.  In the end we will all grow old and pass on.  So before then choose the life how you want.  Live life foolishly and wisely my friends.

behemuthm,TrueFilm,1389301183.0,"I seemed to have picked up on something and curious what y'all think:

This is a sci-fi film. Set in the near-future, the love story is definitely front-and-center, but living in Los Angeles and know what things are planned for in the future (the ability to ride the Metro to the ocean, more skyscrapers downtown, etc) - the subtlety of it all was just awesome. Notice how all the packaging (food, drinks, etc) is all minimal and recyclable? Not to mention the video game he plays, with AI that's clearly beyond what we currently have. It wasn't in-your-face. Going back to the Metro scenes - there's a shot of him riding and you see a building in the far background with an elevated platform and the metro reflected in it - that shit *doesn't exist yet* and it's all in the background. No keyboards in the film. Lots of voice recognition and dictation. And the idea of a surrogate lover because there's now a market for it? Brilliant!

It's not a cold over-glowy sci-fi film like Minority Report (which threw so much ""look at how nifty and *futuristic* we can be!"" in your face) - Spike specifically said he didn't want cold tones for the future.

I dunno - I was geeking out on the nice little touches throughout the film and curious if you folks picked up on all that neat stuff too."

SelfMadeSoul,AskReddit,1389301247.0,"In 1997 I was working for a medium-sized telecom as a as a dial-a-sysadmin for their customers.  The director of our department originally ran a ISDN &amp; dial-up ISP that was bought by that telecom to be their Internet/Data division.  Prior to the sale, the ISP had also been a reseller for a Unix vendor that no longer exists. 

One night, I get a support call from one of their customers, a small dial-up ISP in a small town.  Their only Unix server blew a main board, and they needed to get a replacement via 24-hour support.  I got their information, called the vendor for them, and discovered that their support contract number, which they purchased through us, had never actually existed. 

I immediately went to our director, and his unphased response was ""sounds bad, do whatever you have to do"". Basically we resold them a support contract that we had never purchased for them, and this guy pocketed the cash for it personally. 

So it was on me to ""do whatever I have to do."" I asked their only tech guy (who knew zilch about Unix or Linux) how much time he had available to work on this problem, and he said all night.  I spent all night on the phone with him, walked him through buying a copy of Redhat at the nearest 24-hour place that sold it (Walmart!!), ""borrowing"" their secretary's PC, installing Linux on it, and compiling a custom kernel with a driver for the UNIX vendor's filesystem format.  
Once he had the host on the network, I was able to take over and drive. Twelve hours later, we had their web, SMTP, USENET, and Radius authentication all ported to Linux. 

They asked what they should do for long-term resolution, and I recommended that they sue my boss (personally) for the cash, then use it to build a Linux server farm to replace their one obscure Unix host. 

I moved on to a better job in another city after that. My former boss is now a major IT Executive. 

**TLDR;** my boss defrauded our customer for major cash, and I stayed up all night to port them to Linux for pennies."

screenmagnet,sex,1389301274.0,"Ah, I see. Back when I was online dating before I met my bf, I was always very upfront from the start that I was looking for a serious relationship and that eventually I wanted to marry and have children. If a guy told me he didn't want to marry and have kids within the next 5-10 years, or I thought he wasn't marriage material, I would stop seeing him. I was looking for a husband, but I was very picky, so I didn't want to waste time with guys who didn't have the same goals that I did. The less time you waste dating the wrong guys, the more time you have to find the right guy to build a life with. That's the way I see it, anyway.

Some men think the attitude I outlined above is a red flag. But to me it is just common sense. I don't get men who only want to marry women who aren't looking for a husband. That just seems counterproductive to me."

&gt; **• Simplification comptable pour les entreprises.**

&gt;Quelque 1,4 million d'entreprises de moins de 10 salariés seront exonérées de l'obligation d'établir une annexe comptable et de publier leurs comptes (même s'ils devront toujours les déposer au greffe du tribunal de commerce). Les entreprises de moins de 50 salariés auront, quant à elles, la possibilité d'établir un bilan simplifié. Cela pourra faire économiser jusqu'à 3000 euros à une TPE. L'ordonnance devrait être prête à la fin du mois.

&gt;**• Déclaration sociale nominative**

&gt;Jusqu'au milieu des années 2000, toute entreprise devait déclarer les salaires versés à ses salariés à tous les organismes sociaux (Assedic, 1% logement…). Aujourd'hui, un portail commun existe. La prochaine étape - expérimentée par 30 entreprises - sera de générer automatiquement les données à l'administration via le logiciel de paie. «Les entreprises n'auront plus rien à faire», précise l'Élysée, où l'on chiffre entre 20 et 25% les économies sur la gestion de la paie. Une cinquantaine d'entreprises pourraient être concernées d'ici à mars et 500 en octobre.

&gt;**• Création d'une unité de production**

&gt;Un tel projet est ultraréglementé: l'entreprise doit fournir une étude dans chaque domaine (urbanisme, santé, environnement…) et obtenir une autorisation pour chacun. Les délais peuvent aller jusqu'à 7 ans. La région Midi-Pyrénées expérimente la fusion de toutes les autorisations pour qu'un accord soit donné au bout de 12 mois maximum. L'entreprise n'aurait plus qu'une seule étude à faire réaliser, représentant selon les cas une économie de 40.000 à 200.000 euros, a calculé l'Élysée.

&gt;**• Construction de logements**

&gt;Le gouvernement travaille à des dispositifs qui réduiront considérablement les temps de procédure pour les constructions de logements. Grâce aux ordonnances, la lutte contre les recours juridiques abusifs - pouvant retarder la réalisation d'opérations - sera renforcée. Lors de sa visite, François Hollande procédera à la signature d'un protocole qui engage l'État à céder en plein centre-ville de Toulouse un grand site appartenant au ministère de la Défense, devant permettre de construire 750 logements sociaux à proximité de la future gare TGV de la Ville rose. Il s'agit de «la plus grosse opération de cession de l'État réalisée à ce jour» pour construire des logements, selon un conseiller.

&gt;**• Conseil de la simplification**

&gt;Confié au duo Thierry Mandon-Guillaume Poitrinal et constitué de 12 personnalités qualifiées, ce conseil sera officiellement intronisé par François Hollande ce jeudi. Dix groupes de travail seront conduits sur différents thèmes où l'État pourra simplifier les procédures (exporter, céder son entreprise…). Une centaine de propositions devraient être faites dans l'année qui vient. L'École d'économie de Paris pourrait être chargée d'évaluer l'impact sur la croissance du «choc de simplification»."

Sarahmint,Naruto,1389301321.0,"Sai and Sakura both like books (someone else pointed that out).

Here is the reason Sai and Sakura are perfect for each other;  **Sakura converted Sai.**  It was not Naruto (but naturally he gets the credit for everything).  Sakura took the time to read Sai's book and interpret it.  Sakura spoke to Sai and convinced him to not go through with the mission to kill Sasuke.  Sakura made Sai curious about ""bonds"" and what it is like to love someone that you would go through anything to get to them.  Naruto was only a secondary help with Sai, who looking at Naruto miss Sasuke said ""So that is the face I should have had when my brother died"".    

Later on, Sai's face shows emotion when speaking about, or thinking about Sakura.  **She makes him feel emotion.**   Not going to look for them, but the pages where he tells Naruto ""I can see on your face you love her"" (I think Sai loves her but doesnt even realize) and when he looks at Sakura ""Your words may be sincere, but your smile is not"".  This is coming from someone who is not suppose to have facial expressions or know what facial expressions mean.  He made such a bond with Sakura and Naruto that it may have even surpassed his beloved brother.  Sakura is a highly intelligent doctor and shinobi.  She would enjoy time with him.  There was even a moment when she was taking a morning walk and found Sai painting.  The two had a conversation (in the anime, the scenery was romantic) and Naruto was jealous.  Sai made a joke about it and Sakura hid a laugh.

All this went away when Sasuke made a brief appearance and all the forgotten feelings of her crush came rushing back.  With Sasuke, he can basically have any girl or woman he wants (except for Hinata, which is where the charm mostly comes from)."

kellykebab,funny,1389301381.0,"Well that's why I asked what your expenses were and gave you opportunity to clarify your income as well. Depending on your situation, I don't see how it's anyone's fault but yours that you kept spending money you didn't have.

During the period I mentioned in my own life, I made ~$960/mo after taxes from my day job, with the possibility of maybe $100-200 more from miscellaneous hustling. Rent was under $400/mo, and I bought dirt cheap food, rarely eating out. I had zero debt, which helped, but lived pretty irresponsibly: saving nothing, and going out drinking a lot. I did have occasional bail-out help from family in emergencies, but only a few times a year. And I could usually count on a decent tax refund early in the year. But beyond that, I didn't have food stamps or a trust fund or anything like that and somehow I overdrew maybe once every 6 weeks at most. There were times when I had 68 cents to my name for like 5 days in the dead of winter, but somehow it usually worked out. 

I realize others have it even harder than I did, which is why I asked for more details to your story."
McFemale,DecidingToBeBetter,1389301381.0,"I used to look at my dog and think about her inevitable death and start sobbing and looking at videos of dogs being put down (to prepare myself? Who knows? The depressed mind is just weird). When I talked to my therapist, she pointed out that I was missing out on the good times because I was so filled with worry and sadness. I used thought stopping and replacement to help. When I have an irrational fear about the future I tell myself, ""In this moment, I'm ok."" Of course when I started this I would start thinking, ""well what about when I'm not ok? What will I do then? How will I plan for that if I don't think about it now?"" My therapist reminded me that when I have a crisis, at that point I can think about what to do and I will deal with it then. So when I start asking myself all the ""what ifs"" my answer to myself is, ""In this moment, I'm/she's/he's ok."" Now since I always know what the answer will be, I don't bother worrying about it because it would be a silly waste of time to sit there asking myself questions and giving the same response every time.

redditerrrr,beyondthebump,1389301385.0,"My husband and I both work.  Wiggle is in daycare full time.  The best practices that we have developed are as follows.

* Split the morning routine for Wiggle and the doggies so that each morning is the same and nothing falls through the cracks (a few days of hungry dogs made this point pretty necessary)
* Husband does drop off in the morning on his way to work 
* I do pick up in the afternoon since I get off work an hour and a half before my husband
* Wiggle &amp; Mommy playtime until Daddy gets home
* Daddy does bath time which serves a little Wiggle &amp; Daddy playtime each day
* Mommy and Daddy have a drink and/or cook dinner together after Wiggle is in bed (Mommy &amp; Daddy need time each day too!)

On the weekends we try to maximize the time we all have together and do something fun, even if it just means a quick breakfast at Waffle House before running errands together.  When I first went back to work I was very worried about the amount of time Wiggle was separated from us, but over time we all adjusted quite nicely.  I have a fantastic daycare and that helps a lot.  The teachers are amazing, the facility is very nice, and the other parents are cool.  It's good to have that peace of mind when your little person spends so much time in daycare.

Of course, this is the ideal day.  Sometimes Wiggle falls asleep before Daddy is home and sometimes I go to happy hours with friends after work.  Bottom line, with the morning routine and dedicated family time each weekend we get enough time together that the little hiccups in scheduling don't have that big of an impact.

EDIT: wanted to add that you get what you pay for with daycare.  There are less expensive options and there are more expensive ones.  In my area, the choices were private homes or very low quality day cares or a name brand.  In my limited experience, the name brand was worth it for us.  I pay more than anyone I know, but I am so plugged in to what Wiggle does each day and that was worth it for me.  Fortunately, we both have good jobs so that works for us."

wildweeds,Frugal,1389301437.0,"When I moved from NC to WA this summer, I sold as much as I could before going.  This reduced space, cleared my head, and gave me money to fund the trip.  I used a gps and picked the shortest route, stopping for gas whenever my tank was half full, and pretty much lived on one meal a day plus abundant water, dried apricots, and trail mix.  I had fans that plugged into my outlet, which had room for a phone charger and the gps as well.  I often took a nap midday in some random city's parking lot then continued on my way.  At night I slept at a rest stop (my seats fold down and my trunk is hatchback style so I turned my back area into a bed with some boxes around the edges).  I checked my tires at every single gas-up or rest stop.  Instead of a Uhaul, I bought a trailer from harbor freight and then sold it afterwards.  Learn from my mistakes:  a)make sure to make the walls sturdy.  b)make sure to set up the lights so that you can drive safely on the highway at night and when changing lanes or turning or slowing down don't almost get hit.  c)make sure to have a spare tire for the trailer, and be serious about not driving it more than sixty miles per hour if you don't want a flat.  d)if you cant afford to do that then just get the uhaul trust me it isnt worth the fear and hassle.  But, at the end, instead of being out all that money from Uhaul, you can sell the trailer and get back your money.  Took me one day after listing to sell mine in late August.  I also returned the spare tire to the store and got my money back on that.  Had the trailer been in perfect condition with no scratches or visible signs of use I could have just taken it apart and returned it as well instead of selling it.  "

I know a lot men say just a look and question is all it takes to get in the mood, but honestly if you take the approach of working up to it even a little bit, it can help a lot. Think of the tired housewife stereotype, where by making dinner and complimenting her, making her feel sexy and wanted, doing the little things to make him feel desired might help. 

Hard to say with little context. Since you want it every day, you can apply it as little or as much that works.  I mean I'm a 23 yr old guy, but sometimes I wasn't in the mood all the time. When my ex took the time to spark the emotional connection.. even a little bit, start out with a hug, or good conversation, or remembering good times ( ;) ) it got me in the mindset for it.

Come to curse, get your server, with your choice of mods, easily installed, packaged and distributed to all your friends through our one-click launcher.

I thought I'd gone too far (I tend to get paranoid with too much weed - a main reason I avoid) and that I would die that night for what I did to myself.  But before I went home to await my impending doom, one of the guys there had some night vision goggles.  I went outside and we laid on the ground under some bushes watching people walk around in the night.  It was amazing.  When I got home I logically decided the best place to die was on the living room sofa and that when my housemates found me, I really should have some nice music playing for them.

This is actually a real argument sociologists and historians have made. Most advanced industrial countries experienced huge influxes of women into the labor force during WWII and needed additional sources of cheap labor during the postwar boom. While it's not really true that this directly increased exploitation measured as  the ratio of profits to wages  (these same countries had massive increases in the standard of living), it did dramatically change the structure of the workforce and everyday life. 

What this meant was actually a big topic of postwar feminism. Obviously, the arguments were different, but at about this same time there was a lot of interest in the non-compensated status of domestic labor, like the Wages for Housework movement, and what it meant to define women as workers. 

You can argue that with the neoliberal present, a lot of the security that was implied in the postwar social contract and built on unequal gender roles has actually evaporated, which is a major reason for a perceived crisis in masculinity, so in a cockeyed way this guy is right.

atrain728,DIY,1389301895.0,"Any reason you wouldn't just run one drop per room, and add a switch in the room when necessary? Four per room seems like a great deal of unnecessary cable. The rooms with lots of consumers (office, living room) will probably use more than 4 anyway. Most rooms will use 0-1.

Also, make sure you follow the wiring diagram for the cable. You can get it to work without following the proper wiring diagram (for most purposes) but with a lot of cables over long distances - if you ever have to re-wire a jack you won't want to have to check the wiring order on the other end."
goocy,skeptic,1389301897.0,"OK, let's talk consciousness.

It's an incredibly misunderstood concept outside of psychology, mostly because of its very poor definition in philosophy. For example, the attention-related part ('awareness') and the awake-part (in contrast to unconsciousness) are two completely separate systems in the brain. The first is probably an [artifact from prioritizing information processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemonium_architecture), because the higher parts of the brain are organized like a central information hub. I'm up-to-date on the second network, and it's the most interesting so far (because you can use it to measure wakefulness in coma patients).

When we're talking about consciousness, we probably mean the process that observes &amp; categorizes the world and decides to act. Neurologically, this is again a separate network, the one that gives us the feeling of free will (which is increasingly [seeming to be fake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will), btw).

That's why consciousness certainly isn't an entity, it's at least five different processes in the brain. And as long as you don't believe in an immortal soul, consciousness is gone when the brain is dead."
mrcleanup,offmychest,1389301907.0,"Do you shower in the morning or at night? (assuming you shower daily)

Do you sweat in your sleep at all?

Do you wear full body pajamas?

The thing that matters most is the oils in your skin. If you shower in the morning, you have more oils on your skin by bedtime than if you shower at night. If you sweat at night, more of these oils will transfer to the sheets. If you wear full body pajamas, they will soak up more of your oils so your sheets don't have to.

So what do these oils do? Nothing really on their own, but bacteria love to eat them, (it's what makes your armpits stink, bacteria farts). So over time, more oils accumulate, and the bacteria reproduce and this causes two things to happen, the sheets start to smell, and they also start to discolor.

So the more frequently you wash your sheets, the more often you eliminate this food source. (your body oils) Also, if you let it build up too long then it becomes harder to wash it off, and the discoloration gets hard to get out.

As a general rule of thumb, two weeks is about as long as you should go as a clean sleeper if you want to keep your sheets from looking discolored and getting stinky. A night showerer in full body pajamas could possibly go a lot longer because they aren't actually in contact with the sheets much (the pillowcase is an exception). But a morning showerer who lives somewhere hot and sweats at night will want to wash the sheets more often, probably once a week if they want them to stay nice.

Of course, everyone will have a personal tolerance level, but in general, if you are noticing that your sheets are discoloring or have an odor then you need to wash them more frequently, and if they appear clean and don't smell, then you are probably doing just fine."

Its possibly we are not at war with Syria today because Obama looked at the politics of the war and decided on another avenue. Are you upset that we are not at war with Syira?

bobmuluga,AdviceAnimals,1389302096.0,"Netflix was part of a market Blockbuster didn't join until they saw there was money to be made. They were competing just fine with Netflix until Redbox came around and fucked over their physical stores revenue. By 2009 Redbox had 17% of the market share on DVD rentals. Currently Redbox does over 50% of all DVD rentals in the US and they have an up and coming streaming service that is likely to take off and directly compete with Netflix. In all honesty with Netflix's declining numbers when it comes to DVD-by-mail and the cost of having those distribution centers catches up you could see some major problems for Netflix. Redbox will be filling that gap and likely profiting from it both in streaming and DVD rental.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1389302143.0,"&gt;For someone who grew up during segregation, this is a valid opinion because it's what they grew up with. Older people tend to stick with their beliefs. Even though we now find that racist, racism was a common practice just a few decades ago, and we as open-minded individuals have to take that into account.

We can acknowledge the fact that they lived in a cultural climate that was rampant with such things, but that doesn't mean that we should consider their opinions when it comes to things such as human rights and equal treatment of someone. If a racist individual claims that we shouldn't let black people be pilots because their bodies aren't well equipped for it, is their opinion really *as* valid as evidence that contradicts that?

&gt;While we have our own opinions, so do they, and we don't entirely know why they think that until you ask that person personally. It's rather close-minded to assume where their heads are at

I don't think many people who are saying ""Mind your own business"" are saying that we shouldn't discuss concerns with someone, even if they are coming bigoted roots. However, if someone isn't willing to open their mind and consider the evidence or current culture, then I don't see much point in being open-minded to their ideas since they're refusing to be open-minded to mine."

I've dated extraverts but we need different things from each other and it makes for rough relationships.  Now, introvert /= boring.  I want a guy to be able to carry on a decent conversation, I want an adventure partner who loves doing stuff as much as I do.  I also want a guy who is comfortable with himself and can sit quietly in a room with me while we both read, or surf reddit side-by-side, or whatever and be perfectly fine.

To be perfectly honest...

This is more likely the problem:
&gt; I don't have a lot of women friends and there is a reason. Once things go sour and we've had the ""I Just want to be friends"" they usually stop communicating with me on their own or I just leave because I can't handle being friends with someone I am still attracted to.

You don't seem to have women friends because you have failed romantic relationships that you have tried to salvage into friendship.  I can tell you right now, I don't have any exes that I am still friends with.  I have a couple on facebook, and a few in friends groups that I see occasionally, but none that I still invite to hang out on a regular basis.

If you want lady-friends, you need to be friends with them first, not attempt to date them and then try for a friendship-consolation-prize.  Friendship should be the prize first and foremost.  Because if friendship wasn't the goal first and foremost, then what you're describing sounds like it could be bordering on [this comic](http://i.imgur.com/5TjPf.png) from [this artist](http://callmekitto.tumblr.com/) which is not something ladyfolk generally respond well to."

I had a feeling someone was going to say No True Scotsman but I still think the problem is just with the people. If some women interpret feminism to mean they should physically attack men who haven't done anything, does that mean feminism is violent and unfair? No, these people just wrongly interpreted it for cruel purposes.

I just spent two weeks studying hateful/derogatory speech at an Orthodox college and the short answer is that no, shaming or attacking or being violent to others--especially fellow Jews--is just really wrong. Nobody is perfect, so pointing out that someone is doing X incorrectly isn't a good thing--the thought process is that the accuser is equally guilty of his own sins and shouldn't be pointing out others. You're not even allowed to comment in passing that so and so ate pork / didn't go to shul / was rude to his mom, let alone go up and humiliate them for it.

It actually was bothering me a little too, because I kept seeing your pictures and going ""No way, she's way too big to be a 30DD!""  But projected breasts tend to seem a lot larger than shallow breasts, so it's all starting to come together.

Yeah, you can buy inserts - they're sometimes called ""cutlets"" or ""chicken cutlets"" (ew), and if you search Amazon for that you'll find them.  I know I've seen them at Dillards before too, if you have a Dillards in your area.  I think some people here have simply cut out the pushup pad of an old bra and used that for an insert.

I'm not sure on the Stocking/Zipper stripe.  Those two have tended not to work for shallow breasts (though I don't have nearly as much data for them as I do the Eyelet Lace).  For me personally, the Stocking Stripe had too much projection and cut in too much at the top, so it may work better for you."

What I'm saying is you can't just spend a healing surge whenever; something has to happen that costs a healing surge.

No.

Is that wrong?

&gt;A free market is self-regulating with immediate rather than delayed feedback mechanisms. Consumers immediately shy away from bad business practices, with no victims on the consumer end.

No.

&gt;Inequality and huge disparaties in standards of living in a free market society is merely the result of lack of effort (or maybe ineptitude) on part of the lower income bracket. In either case, it does not constitute a moral problem, and the poor can only blame themselves.

Most guys are trying to get laid anyway they can, even if it's subconscious. You use what tools are given to you. Maybe you're not that super attractive guy, but you're nice and can promise a girl a relationship if she'll put out. Which isn't to say the guy doesn't care about the girl too, but sex is clearly a major factor. Unless he's really just that lonely that any human contact with a girl makes it worth it.

So when I guys says ""oh, I just don't want to get laid. I want to be in a relationship"" most guys know enough to call *bullshit*. If you could live the playboy lifestyle, you would. So you're rationalizing, plain and simple. And so you get made fun of because you have to commit to some girl in order to get laid."

Anyway, it was night and I was lying on the ground on guard duty together with someone else. Everyone suspected the whole time that at some night, they would make a fake attack (some clues and insinuations) and that whoever didn't react probably would get hell so we were agitated. In the middle of the night, three people came close to us and I said loudly and clearly the parole word. They didn't respond. I said it a second time, a little louder. Still no answer. So I took a  shot at them (with blanks of course).

Turns out, the other group had a patrol and no one bothered to tell us. They were furious, as was everyone who had to get up at three in the morning and get battle-ready, meaning getting your boots, grab your gun and crouch towards some hole in the ground (we were around 100-200 people)."

This was exactly me an year ago. I once met her in an elevator with a bunch of strangers. I just said ""Nice weather"", and started my first convo with her. Like winter's nice, summer's harsh, rain sucks, and then what's your name, and so on. Later we kept exchanging hellos. Cracked a few jokes now and then. And then once I just asked her out. She said she has a boyfriend, so I dropped pursuing (nothing to pursue really after that).

But if you start talking, you'll know if she's going to take it cool or if she'll freak out. This girl was super cool and matched my wave length, so I took the risk. Also she works for a different company, but we meet in the same building and she knew no one from my company, so that's another advantage I had (no shaming if I got rejected 'cause the word wouldn't go around).

But I had also approached a girl at work, like 5 years ago. She and me were like good friends, used to chat all night and stuff. I told her I liked her 'cause I really did, and that's it. The bitch freaked out, stopped talking to me, made me feel like shit, the word got also got around, and I had to quit the company. Now, I was a bit of a pussy back then but now I wouldn't quit and I'd just not give a fuck as long as I'm not going to be fired, but anyway that made me absolutely immune to rejection because no other girl freaked out like that ever since."

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1389303135.0,"This topic delves much further into psychology than philosophy. We, as humans, make a lot of generalizations throughout our lives. It helps to speed the thought making process and basically is the brain's way of making a shortcut. For instance, we can reasonably assume that a blade will cut us and it will hurt (as opposed to a dull blade or a fake blade). This in and of itself may seem trivial but think of all the actions you do because you assume a certain procedure (hot water is the left knob, righty tighty lefty loosey, the car's ignition is on the right side of the steering wheel).

What this means is that when a person can look at something and automatically make a judgement of they ""like it"" or they ""hate it"" it's because of these generalizations. 

Of course, this usually just applies to instant reactions (a man walks up to you with a knife, you'd be afraid). When you are faced with a situation in which you have absolutely no prior experience, then you'd go into the logical deduction phases."

Why would you say that?

As a personality, a captain, and a locker-room presence, it's clear that Crosby is a better leader. He contributes more defensively. And to compare career stats (so far):

**Crosby**

Points per game: 1.42

avg season +/-: 13.1

Avg Time on Ice: 21:10

**Jagr** (NHL only)

PPG: 1.20

avg +/-: 12.1

Avg Time on Ice: 20:42+

*+ not on record for his first 8 seasons*

Time will tell if Crosby will last as long as Jagr has. Purely from a talent standpoint, I'd say they're comparable. However, as a member of a team, I don't think it's a stretch to say Crosby's a better hockey player.

Thjoth,Planetside,1389303188.0,"I played EVE for nine years and right at 16,000 hours, and although I don't anymore, I like to think it actually positively effected me in a lot of ways.  It greatly improved my ability to interact and strike deals with other people, for example.  That was actually a tremendous help to the rest of my life because I'm a high functioning autistic who had an utter and total lack of social awareness for a very long time, but EVE and the people I met there (who I still regularly talk to) really helped to compensate for that.  I still have a total lack of social awareness, but I can deal with it now.  The vast majority of people can no longer tell that I have a disability; they just think I'm a little ""quirky.""

The biggest positive to it, though, was gaining the ability to crush one's emotions into the back of your mind while you're dealing with a negative or just generally extreme situation.  Even in real life, when something goes wrong, I still instinctively speak in my extremely calm, measured, ""Fleet Command"" voice in order to avoid getting others wound up, and immediately begin working to rectify the situation as best I can.  Any kind of unsuppressed emotional response or hesitation as a fleet commander was the kiss of death, and losing in EVE was truly traumatic, even more traumatic than a car accident or anything like that in reality.  I haven't been in this kind of situation, but I would honestly say that some of the bad situations you can find yourself in in that game will trigger the same kind of response as getting into a potentially deadly confrontation in reality.

Frankly, I don't think the word ""game"" should really be used when talking about EVE.  I don't know what word should be used for it, because that word hasn't been invented yet, but it's evolved into something else entirely.  For the few people that it truly connects with, it becomes a real, meaningful stage of their lives, or even a permanent part.  In my case, it was a completely life-changing experience."

dunnoyabassa,relationship_advice,1389303193.0,"first of all, let's reexamine your goal here.  you want to stop talking so much, but why?

&gt;I hate myself for being this way

there it is.

this isn't about how much you talk, this is about how you feel about yourself.  i imagine if you found a way to stop talking entirely, there would be plenty left in your head for you to beat yourself up over.

your history of abuse is heartbreaking, and while i expect you've heard the line ""it's not your fault"" quite often... it doesn't seem like you've internalized the message yet.  while i suspect and hope you understand it wasn't your fault you were abused as a kid, it doesn't sound like you've fully grasped the concept that you truly don't DESERVE the hand you've been dealt in life generally.  nobody does.  we're born to our parents through sheer dumb luck, and we don’t get to choose how they treat us.  sometimes they are billionaires with lavish inheritances sitting in the bank, sometimes they aren't.

the thing is when we hate ourselves and we look at the future, we idealize some illusion of perfection hoping we can actually reach it.  we think ""if i am just ENOUGH all my hopes and dreams can come true, and i can be permanently happy and full of bliss.""  

but this simply isn't true.  

the fact of the matter is, things much less severe than abuse continue to hurt in life forever.  we go through breakups, we go through job losses, we get in car accidents, and the furnace breaks.  we can always look back on what we did or didn't do and determine why it wasn't ENOUGH.  the truth is though, there's no such thing as enough; we could always have a little more, we could always try a little bit harder.  the definition of ""enough"" is something we can only know in retrospect.  to constantly try to be ""enough"" is hopeless.  sometimes we succeed in spite of poor efforts, sometimes we fail in spite of great ones.  there isn't some state of permanent bliss that some people have managed to attain by having ENOUGH glorious things happen to them.

the fact of the matter is you have a slightly unique habit that happens to make you self-conscious.  you talk a lot.  that's all.  you don't talk too much, or too little, or just enough because all these ideas imply there is some perfect target of ""the right number of words to make people like me.""  there is no such thing.

you have no control over how other people choose to behave.  unfortunately this fact has led to some very very difficult experiences for you, and for that you have my absolute deepest sympathies.  HOWEVER, this fact is the main reason you shouldn't be so preoccupied with tailoring your behavior to please other people.  you can't be anybody else, and other people's experiences aren't some shiny gold trophies free of unpleasantness.  you need to own who you are, love who you are, be who you are (chatterbox included) and apologize to no one for it, including yourself.

the road to self love is a long and hard one, but it's worth it because loving yourself is awesome.  loving yourself isn't awesome because boys date you, or because you get good jobs, or because everything that happens to you suddenly is always great.  loving yourself is awesome because when boys DO dump you, or when you DO get fired from a job your reaction isn't to say ""am i talking too much? what's wrong with me? why did this happen?""  your reaction is to say ""fuck that i rule,"" let's try again next time."

I'm not even three months into this and I've lost 40lbs. As a very short women, with an 8-5 desk job who didn't start weighing all that much, comparatively. I feel like I cracked some sort of code on this diet. I don't know how, or what I'm doing right or wrong. 

I keep waiting for a stall, or to stop losing, or to gain some back, or what have you. But it just keeps coming off. I'm not complaining, I just feel like my friends that are seeing me go through this diet, and ask me for tips because they to want to or have started keto, aren't going to have the same luck I've had and get discouraged.

I fit into that second group, not the first. It sounds like you do too. I tried everything I could think of, for over 10 years, to control my drinking. All that time it got more and more out of control. The only thing that has ever worked for me reliably and long-term is abstinence. Many other alcoholics have also found this to be true.

On the bright side - now that I've gotten the liberal arts out of my system, I'm in a much better position to study something that'll get me a normal, better-paying job. And since I already have a four-year degree, the career change isn't going to take forever. Hooray!

But I only wanted to date men who were in the stage of their life where they were looking for a future wife. If marriage wasn't even on the table, then there was no point dating him to find out if I would fall in love with him or not. On the other hand, some men I met said they wanted to start having kids in the next 3-5 years, and I knew that was too soon for me (I was only 21 at the time).

Those women you describe are probably desperate because their bio clock is running out. That's why I started the husband search in my early twenties. I wanted to leave myself plenty of time because I didn't want to be one of those women who spent their 20s partying and then wake up at age 30 afraid they will end up alone and looking to lock down a man ASAP. I didn't want to have to settle because I was running out of time. That was always a big fear of mine. So I made sure not to waste my 20s sleeping around without a care for the future."

namer98,DebateReligion,1389303381.0,"&gt; You need to understand the essence of the Law. If you have done nothing during six days, what is the meaning of the Sabbath then?

If I do nothing, on the seventh day I do nothing because God commanded it.

&gt;Because assuredly you don't need to rest the seventh day if you have slacked the other days of the week... Why would God want that?

When we rest, we do it because God rested. What does it mean for God to rest?

&gt;Likewise those disciples, hungry or starving had been unable to gather the other days so why would observing Sabbath be good for them?

To say they are starving is making a leap not found in the text.

&gt;Jesus stated that Sabbath should not be the highest priority law since it has been made for men's comfort (i.e. not working 7 days a week).

Exodus 35:3

&gt; but it's better to understand its meaning than following it blindly in my opinion.

So, what does it mean for God to rest? And what does it mean for us to emulate God resting?"

tecmec,engineering,1389303385.0,"&gt; both Saskatoon and Regina have a fairly large tech sector, R&amp;D, etc

I graduated from the U of R in 2011. No, Regina and Stoon do not have much of that at all. Name 10 companies in Regina that make some sort of electronic product. I sure can't. You can work Sasktel or Saskpower, but you're not really going to be ""designing"" much. It's high-level (almost management) type engineering at best. There's PTI if you wanna design transformers. What else? Norantel closed up shop. There are two consulting companies (Alfa, and some bigger one that I can't remember the name of) that do building electrical systems. Stantec probably has a couple EEs on staff. That's all I can think of. With so few companies here, how many could possibly be hiring EITs? Especially with the U of R pumping out new grads every year.

I suppose you could call up Commutron (in Elbow) and ask them if any of their clients are hiring. They may be more familiar with some of the smaller local companies that may exist around here. 

Saskatoon does have a few more companies that actually build things. But still, they're small companies mostly (I think).

Most people need to leave Saskatchewan if they want a job designing things as an EE. This is oil country, unfortunately. Go work at a mine as a controls engineer. :/"

So while I prefer a certain type, I will absolutely date someone outside that type if they are an awesome person. 

An insistence is when you will only date, say, tall boys or skinny girls or girls with big boobs, and you refuse to step outside of that. More than that, you will announce this insistence to everyone, usually putting down people who do not fit your requirements. This is when it stops being okay.

This is also the reason I really hate it when guys say ""no fat chicks"". Although it has nothing to do with me, I am angry and frustrated that so many guys think it's totally okay to openly announce this and hurt my friend's feelings in the process.

Hmmm... its interesting you forget he did that after countless US officials admitted to doing the same. Hillary Clinton came out with it too. So did Obama. And all of these people were talking about the same specific events. They were both being forthright, and unified in regretting the actions and manipulation in regards to the mujahideen of Afghanistan.

&gt;The country has a well-earned and well-deserved reputation for condoning terrorism, if not outright sponsoring it. 

Hmmm...

I wonder which other country can claim the same. More so than any other country on earth. And if its not terrorist groups outright, its supporting despotic rogue regimes supporting terrorist groups or sowing internal instability, radicalism and militarization that fosters it. All in the name of its own geopolitical interests.
(Pakistan's Islamization under the dictator Zia-ul-Haq was also done under US funding and approval, because Zia was such a good dog)

I'm not nor will I ever condone Pakistan's *cooperation* with the US(and others like Saudia) in creating these terrorist groups and then when their use by the US had passed, trying to buddy up with the new group.

He drinks out of a sippy, but only water.  We offer whole milk in a sippy at mealtime, but he doesn't really drink it.  My next hurdle will be getting off the bottle.  My plan was to nurse in the morning and at night and have whole milk at daycare.  But, once he got on the whole milk, he was happy with it.  We started doing a more filling solid foods breakfast and now he doesn't nurse or have a bottle in the morning.  That left only a nighttime nursing session and once a week I am out of the house after work so he was used to getting a bottle from my husband.  About 2 weeks in that pattern and I had quit pumping at work and ran out of freezer stash so we just switched to the whole milk bottle at night.  There were a rough couple of evenings, but he gets more whole milk and it seems to be more filling so he quit waking up in the middle of the night and he likes that better.  I guess I got lucky, but kids are resilient and if you can stomach a few angry days then maybe you can be done?  Maybe try keeping his belly full during the day with solids and offer the sippy with milk a lot?  That way he doesn't have that usual feeling of hungry/tired/want to nurse?

waferdog,minnesotavikings,1389303682.0,"The story of how the Vikings became the Vikings is kind of interesting.  I'll try to present it in as concise a form as I can.  This is off the cuff from memory so there may be a few items not dead accurate.  

It all started in the 1920s actually.  Ole Hausgrud owned one of the earliest NFL franchises, the Duluth Eskimos (there is a very good article on them from 1989 in the SI archives somewhere, they were also the inspiration for the movie Leatherheads).  They only played a couple of seasons before disbanding/were sold off.  Unofficially, through many machinations, they became the Redskins. But that's a different story.

Ole no longer had an NFL team but what he did have was the rights to any NFL team in Minnesota.  This would be important a little over thirty years later.

In the late 50s, the Twin Cities was an up and coming urban and wanted in on the big league sports.  An ownership was put together and attempted to get an NFL franchise but were rebuffed.  They had a backup plan in the new AFL (The NFL and AFL merged in the early 70s to form one league).  As soon as they were awarded the AFL franchise the NFL decided that they did not want to lose the market so they immediately gave them a franchise.  This is were Ole comes back into play.

Since Ole owned the rights to an NFL franchise in Minnesota, he needed to be either bought out or brought in.  They ended up bringing him as one of the original owners (I believe there were 10 in the group).  Now, Ole was from Superior, WI originally (right across from Duluth, MN) and had gone to school at Central High School in Superior.  Central's mascot?  Vikings.  Central's school colors? Purple and gold.

As an aside, Bud Grant also attended Central High in Superior although he was a few years after Ole.  Doug Sutherland, defensive lineman during the 70s glory years, was also from Superior but I do not know if he attended Central."

porpoiseoflife,worldbuilding,1389303815.0,"I'm going to waffle for a moment and say...

It depends. 

Are your races all monolithic? Does each race have one and only one cultural identity? Are the governments and/or religious leaders of each race in near-absolute control over their society? Are your gods real, capable of walking your world and dispensing boons to the worthy and punishments to those that break the laws of the gods? If so, then you could probably get away with one for each race. 

But that type of inflexibility might lead you into problems at some point. What would happen in wars when one race conquers another and enslaves their people? Would the victors forbid their slaves from worshiping their old gods? Or what about a civil war that disrupts the main government's absolute power over an area? Would the old ways all continue to hold sway, or will new and different and possibly heretical ways begin to come to the fore?  

/u/atomicpenguin12 covered how major religions are born, and did an excellent job of it. So I won't bother to repeat everything that he (Or possibly she? It's hard to tell on the internet at times.) already covered. But I will mention one other thing...

Every permanent society, regardless of how small, has a religion. A tribe of 12 people struggling to survive in the wilds of Kamchatka have their own gods. Every small Polynesian island has their gods. An African village barely eking out an existence on the Sahel has their gods. Even the Internet has created its own nascent gods; as the cults of Godwin, Gaben, and Wiki have shown, not to mention the fanatical devotion of the Cult of Jobs, belief is a standard condition of the human species. How many people guard against the Great Law of Archdaemon Murphy with the mumbled prayer of ""Maybe I should get some extra supplies..."" and invoking the name of Justin Case, the Patron Saint of the Prepared?

(Yes. I know that the Church of Gaben is a satirical thing. But religions need not be serious to become real. They only need to be.)

But in contained societies, the gods become small. Principles such as Good or Justice or Disease or War matter less than the spirit that protects a spring of good water. Or the spirits of air that hold back the wind so that an arrow flies true. Or the spirit of the herd that brings the deer back through the valley at the same time every year. These, and many others related to the daily and consistent necessities of life, were the among first religions of this world. Yet in most places these religions are dead, for there is no one left who remembers the names of their spirits. The only non-tribal environment that I can think of that hasn't lost touch with the older spirits would be the Shinto-dominant areas of Japan.

Religion need not mean *GREAT HONKING HOLY MOTHER OF SOCIAL STRUCTURE, BATMAN*. Religion is found everywhere in all societies. Always remember that as you are building your world, and leave room for things to grow."

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1389303825.0,"Two wrongs don't make a right, and you don't deserve abuse.

Honestly, if he's going to forgive you then he needs to forgive you. Holding resentment towards you isn't forgiving you. Granted, letting go of resentment is *far* easier said than done. But verbally abusing you when he's been drinking is no way to deal with that resentment and anger. 

I know a lot of people see cheating as the ultimate wrong in a relationship. I don't really agree. I don't think it's OK, I just don't think it's the worst thing you can do to a partner. I honestly think abuse (physical, verbal, or emotional) is far worse. A cheater hurts their partner as a side effect of their actions. An abuser is purposely trying to hurt their partner. 

My advice is to seriously and soberly evaluate this relationship. It might be time to end it. If you feel you want to salvage it, then you two need to work out the anger and resentment and forgiveness soberly. 

You really don't deserve abuse.

Good luck."

If we're gonna be rational about it, what difference does it make whether you personally killed anyone? Sure, it makes a difference on an emotional level, but on a rational level if you are part of the military, especially in a war zone, then you are participating one way or another in killing.

Think about how difficult it is to convict someone of rape nowadays, and realize that back then you were lucky if it was even taken seriously as a crime at all. And that's only taking into account the more civilized times and locations.

The fact that you can even suggest that everything now isn't automatically better on the whole than it used to be means you aren't taking into account all the perspectives and information.

And if you're trying to suggest specifically that everything got better between the 40's and the 80's (or whatever other random timeframe you're thinking of) and then everything somehow took a nosedive, you're even more obviously wrong.

does people ""inside a circle"" fighting for money, power and control translate to them being representative of the people that live in the country to you?

mrcleanup,confession,1389304062.0,"&gt;This girl was my antidepressant.

That's just the thing. These relationships are all just bandaids. You don't trust yourself to provide validation of yourself so you are forced to get it from someone else. Without the bandaid, you are forced to acknowledge the wound underneath and your unhappiness. You don't love yourself more when you are in a relationship, they distract you from it, you rely on their judgement and ignore your own.

I believe that to have a good healthy relationship each person must know themself, accept themself, and share themself truthfully.

You clearly don't approve of yourself and until you do any relationship you have will be flawed. How can you ever trust that someone loves you when you so clearly disagree with their decision, and see yourself as so deeply flawed?

One of the hardest things is to look at our shortcomings and our problems, stop wishing we didn't have them, start accepting that they are a part of us, and start figuring out how to live with them in a way where we can know that the decisions we are making are the best we can do, and respect ourselves for it. It can be enough knowing that you aren't perfect, but that you really are doing the best you can for yourself and for others.

My wife for example, she isn't perfect. Sometimes she gets really angry, her brothers have tempers and she does too, but she hates that part of herself, she refuses to let it control her but it does control her when it comes. So what does she do? When she senses it coming, she ends the conversation, she tells me she needs to *not* talk about it right now, that she needs space because she is very angry, she goes to another room to get space. And I give her that space, and later, we talk. She can't control how she reacts, but she can control how she acts, and she can face her rage on her terms.

Face your shortcomings, see where they take you that you don't want to go. Identify the problems it causes, be brutally honest. Then, learn to spot the signs that this is coming, head it off, take it somewhere where you get to decide how it affects your life.

I can't know what specific answers will work for you, just that they will only work well if you find themself, and that once you learn to love yourself, then your relationships won't need to be bandaids anymore."

TheMarkHasBeenMade,nursing,1389304198.0,"People can be bitches. That's something I went into my career knowing and expecting because I've seen it everywhere, especially in my clinicals. No matter what you do, some people just don't plan nice in the sandbox. Don't let it get you down, though. Keep talking to the people who are nice and leave the craggy sourpusses alone. Always display the same nice attitude towards them, but I wouldn't waste your energy on trying to get too friendly with them. Work professionally around them, offer help if it seems like it's needed (and wouldn't be minded), and carry on your business. 

There are plenty of people who will enjoy your pleasant persona if you shine it on everybody. Whenever I pick up the phone, I try to sound positive and ask how the person is doing before we get to business. And people really appreciate that, and will be nice back to you more often than not, especially if you're consistent about it. I greet all my colleagues, and take a little time to chat up those who want to tell me about how their holiday was, etc (smalltalk can be just a thirty second thing before you move on back to work but it can still help to keep the mood up).

And regarding that charge nurse, keep aware around her if she's doing that sort of thing to you. There's nothing wrong with you calling her out on bending the rules in her favor; it's not fair, it's not professional, and you shouldn't have to deal with it. It helps to know when to stand your ground some, too. Some people who are catty will respond with respect to you standing up for yourself or others where it's appropriate, and those who don't are scummy and a poor excuse for a nurse. There was one nurse who wouldn't lift a finger while he was charge; he changed his assignment to have a super easy workload and then he'd sit around playing games while the rest of us were busting our chops, and if we asked for help we typically couldn't rely on him. Eventually enough people piped up about him to the management that they brought him in to the office to speak with him on the matter and he was pulled from being able to do charge for a few weeks.

Make a team with those who don't mind hearing you out, and if you don't have many senior members among you, don't be afraid to refer to your hospital policies and procedures for guidance on best practice and clarification of information. But don't be afraid to ask questions in times where you need more experienced guidance, especially if it's on the verge of an emergency. And know your chain of command. If your charge nurse is straight up ignoring you and you're dealing with the endangerment of a patient's life, you can always contact the nursing supervisor stating you've got an emergency and you need help immediately.

It's a shame you can't have more widespread acceptance of working together as a team, it greatly changes the mood on the floor and makes the job a lot more pleasant and stress-free. Get your experience at that job but don't be afraid to seek other employment while you do so. It couldn't hurt to try to find other options while you're employed, more experience as a nurse opens up wider ranges of nursing jobs. Talk to your nurse recruiter or management about switching departments within the hospital, if they know you're looking for something else but you're willing to stay an employee in that facility, they're usually pretty helpful about seeing what's open.

Don't give in to the catty bullshit! It doesn't have to be like that at work! "

HalfysReddit,TwoXChromosomes,1389304222.0,"&gt; Surely you aren't saying that just because we aren't keeping tabs on everyone's quality of life as a result of gaining employment or not due to gender, there isn't a point to discussing it. That would be absurd. We can in fact track the general quality of life of men versus women(or any majority versus minority) based on things like census data and polling, though.

I'm not saying that there's no point in discussing it, I'm saying that it's incredibly arrogant and unhelpful to spout one's speculations as fact. And while census information and self-reports are useful data, they're often not as reliable as we like to believe they are, and very often I have witnessed data being skewed to serve an agenda.

&gt; Also, nobody is saying that people should be dismissed as allies because they don't believe the exact same. The idea is that if someone is entering a space where the acknowledged intent is to discuss the issues women face, trying to discuss men's issues inherently minimizes and detracts from the stated goal of the conversation.

This is actually exactly what the author of the article argued. You want equality? Cool. Are women way more oppressed than men? Say yes or you're not welcome here. Do you want to talk about the issues men face? Say no or you're not welcome here.

The goal of feminism is different depending on who I've asked, but primarily people have argued that feminism is for gender equality, or that feminism is for advancing the rights of women. If it's the former, then there's no reason to suggest that feminism should limit its focus to women only. If it's the latter, then these arguments are valid, but I would have to disagree with their definition of feminism, and we'd still be holding conflicting opinions."

screenmagnet,sex,1389304281.0,"The blood flow to the penis is therapeutic. Cialis is often prescribed after surgery for prostate cancer, which leaves a man impotent for 2 years until the nerves heal. Unfortunately, going 2 years without any erections is not good for the penis -- it basically atrophies and can shrink or never become erect again. So right after surgery, the men start taking cialis every single day for 1-2 years to maintain blood flow to their penis until they start having erections again. This is referred to as penile rehabilitation following prostate surgery, by urologists in the field.

Recent studies also suggest a variety of other health benefits for low dose daily cialis:
- treats BPH (enlarged prostate)
- reduces inflammation in the body
- May improve cardiovascular health
- increases testosterone/estrogen ratio
- treats pulmonary arterial hypertension

My hunch is that a decade or two from now, tons of men will be on low dose daily cialis, particularly men with metabolic syndrome or at high risk of heart problems. Possibly women too."

WiFi is in all ways inferior to a hard-wired connection. It's higher latency, it's lower bandwidth (in practice) and it's not bidirectional. 

The difference between wired vs wireless will manifest itself differently in different applications. It makes almost no difference for bandwidth heavy things like Netflix or torrents, while it's absolutely deadly for any kind of hosting, which obviously is affected (and affected not linearly) by the number of clients."

Anyway, I'm white as fuck, so everyone was surprised when I would switch to Spanish when they struggled with English. But more than one time, strictly out of curiosity, I would pretend to not speak Spanish around certain people. A lot of the younger Spanish people in need of assistance were curt, rude, abrupt.

MikeyDeez,socialwork,1389304392.0," I can't see how you were discriminated against according to the laws. Its up to you to make known the ""need for reasonable accommodation."" Your employer isn't even allowed to ask if you have a disability or what your disability is. However, if they asked if you can perform the job ""with reasonable accommodation"". 

From the [EEOC](http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/disability.cfm): 

&gt;Disability discrimination occurs when an employer or other entity covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, or the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, treats a qualified individual with a disability who is an employee or applicant unfavorably because she has a disability.


&gt;The law places strict limits on employers when it comes to asking job applicants to answer medical questions, take a medical exam, or identify a disability.

&gt;For example, an employer may not ask a job applicant to answer medical questions or take a medical exam before extending a job offer. An employer also may not ask job applicants if they have a disability (or about the nature of an obvious disability). An employer may ask job applicants whether they can perform the job and how they would perform the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.

&gt;After a job is offered to an applicant, the law allows an employer to condition the job offer on the applicant answering certain medical questions or successfully passing a medical exam, but only if all new employees in the same type of job have to answer the questions or take the exam.

&gt;Once a person is hired and has started work, an employer generally can only ask medical questions or require a medical exam if the employer needs medical documentation to support an employee's request for an accommodation or if the employer believes that an employee is not able to perform a job successfully or safely because of a medical condition.

Personally, I'd encourage you to tell employers after you're hired.  Its only hurting you and the company to deprive them of a great worker who's totally capable of excelling at the job by not requesting reasonable accommodations.
 
I have a numerical/mathematical learning disability which while severe, goes unnoticed by most because I am a great speaker and writer and honestly, I don't do much math at my job.  

However, its nearly impossible for me to keep track of time, and remembering dates or anything tied to a numerical value I can't turn into a word is out of the question.  At too many jobs I didn't say anything because I was afraid people might associate ""LD"" with ""stupid"".  

With my current employer, my supervisor commented (not necessarily in a disciplinary way) about my slight tardiness. The next day, I asked the company HR lady (its a small company) to meet with my supervisor and me.  I gave my supervisor a copy of my psychological assessment and explained my condition. She was more than understanding and even goes to the trouble to write out every meeting/deadline she gives me on a sticky note because she knows the numbers won't stay in my head.  

I know everybody is different and a learning disability is a different ballgame than Terrible-Palsy. I think its admirable how you refuse to let your diagnosis define you.

thehalfchink,DotA2,1389304668.0,"First thing you need to know about the differences with LoL and DOTA2 is that supports are much stronger in DOTA.

As a support in LoL, at every stage of the game I felt squishy and useless; except for warding (which supports still primarily do in DOTA). However, in DOTA there is no 'Ability Power Carries', so 'casters' have strong base damage on their spells - particularly supports.

Most supports have stuns, snares, and similar CC abilities - as a result, some supports make **great** gankers; you'll often see supports rotating from lanes once their carry has secured safe farm, so that they can help out other lanes. In most cases, the early and mid-game can be determined by your supports. Constant ganks, good vision/warding, and roaming through the enemy jungle can psych out the enemy carries, or deny them farm (which also delays the late-game, and may delay the time it takes for the enemy carry to 'come online'). On average, if your supports can't secure your early game, the carry can't carry into the late game (note: not always the case, if your carry can still somehow secure farm).

I'd suggest playing supports for a while until you've seen what the carries can do; how to secure farm, when to engage/disengage from team fights, and when to just avoid team fights in general and keep farming.

If you want to play a stealthy hero who can both nuke, and has invisibility (and also a very strong skill set), I'd try playing Nyx Assassin. A ranged, skill-shot stun (can hit multiple targets), a mana burn that deals more damage and burns more mana based on enemy intellect, a damage reflect that also stuns on first instance of damage dealt per attacker, and an ultimate that grants invisibility, and bonus damage on first attack that breaks your invis."

I would like to preface my response by saying I would never call that person ""crazy"". I wouldn't put crazy as a deal breaker on my profile either. That being said, I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with her at this point in my life. I have been with a couple of girls who have depression (at the very least) and it is just not something I am comfortable going through again in my future relationships. I would very much like to be their friend but the thought of being with someone whose demeanor could totally change for no other reason than a forgotten medication puts me off dating them.

Also, the sight of an eight inch penis is very appealing, so you have that going for you as well.

As far as your girth goes, experiment with positions, wipe away excess precum and wetness during sex, and make sure you are as hard as possible (cock rings, pumping, cialis, good diet and exercise, kegels, etc). Those things will make the most of the girth that you have. Also, tease the girl with a finger for a long time before you insert your penis.

You don't need to wait a couple of months. Just start with stronglifts 5x5 (very similar to starting strength) - you literally start with an empty barbell (so you can concentrate on form without actual load) and it's a simple linear progression from there.

Also start trying to max out your bodyweight squats and pushups at home/work etc.

I use Mukluk boots but I really hate them. They're not waterproof at all and her feet are always soaked through.

Hence, she is shamed, for poor judgement.

My sociology teacher explained another reason people are justified in being so uptight over keeping such seemingly tiny and harmless social rules(granted he was speaking in response a question about freedom of drug use but I think a part of his answer applies here). A social system can absorb some deviation, but too much of it and it causes fractures and cascade failure, since failure or drastic change in one aspect of society invariably negatively affects other important social systems.

 Society can absorb 100,000 slutty women, not much changes. But if you go past say just for an example, a large proportion, like 3% of attractive women being complete whores, than it upsets the system, causes all sorts of unpredictable domino effects(use your imagination). Societies have evolved to enforce limits, on an individual level, to restrict rapid social change, because it is disastrous for stability and growth."

insidia,teaching,1389305350.0,"1. Get really good at working efficiently.  WORK when you are at work- don't spend time on other things.  Figure out a system to prioritize tasks, and what works for you to move through them as quickly as possible.  

2. I set a really clear boundary, that I do not work on weekends.  If that means I work longer days during the week, fine.  If that means that some stuff doesn't get done as quickly as I might like, that's fine too.  Realize that it's generally not the end of the world if you take one more day to get an assignment back to students.

3. Collect less stuff.  Think VERY carefully about if it's really worth the time every time you want to collect something.

4. Create an obligation that requires you to go- join a workout group, a choir, whatever it takes to say, ""nope, sorry, I have to go do this other thing for me now.""

5. Become okay with not doing everything well.  This is hard, but it's HUGE.  Pick one or two things a year to work on- it's a marathon, not a sprint.  For example, this year my goal is to create an essay rubric that really works for me and my students, and get better at communicating with my advisory group.  I will continue to do the best I can at everything else, but these are the areas I'm really focusing on for improvement.

6. Don't check work email at home on the weekends or evenings.  Just don't do it.

7. Specifically for writing teachers:  I give feedback to the penultimate drafts of papers.  This takes lots of time.  What I do is I have the final drafts (which don't receive detailed feedback, but simply a grade from my rubric) due on a rolling deadline, 1 week after they receive their feedback from me.  I create a Google doc that I share with students to track deadlines.  It really helps to manage the workload."

If you don't wish to reveal more, that's fine. I'm still confused how it would be possible to overdraft *that* many times. Perhaps I wouldn't be as interrogative if you didn't blame the banks for your problems. 

&gt;how do you get out without sacrificing your living conditions or food situation

Well, you make sacrifices. There were days where I had to eat nothing but ramen or had to sell clothes I liked. The fact that you're 40 and this is still your attitude is the biggest source of confusion. The bank is taking a risk by continuing to allow you to spend money that you don't have (technically a pool of money that actually belongs to other people). Hence the fees. I wish the world was more lenient to those with low income as well, but it clearly isn't. It's a bit odd to blame the bank for not also functioning as a charity.

Maybe you were taking care of a kid or had to help your parents with their prescriptions or had a mountain of student loans. I could certainly understand all that, but with no more info to go on, yeah, I'm a bit suspect of your spending habits.

I don't honestly know what would have happened differently if I didn't get the occasional gift and have since switched banks so there's no way to check the record. I suspect I would have spent differently if I knew I couldn't expect emergency aid though. For one thing, I would have sold my car much sooner. And I probably would have looked for a higher paying job or at least something truly full time (I was doing 30-35 hrs/wk). 

I should make it clear though, there were many times where that .68 balance was remedied by my own resourcefulness rather than receiving a ""loan"" from others. And remember, I didn't have a credit card to defer actual payment to the future. I could only ever spend what was on hand. My point is that even with no outside help, I usually found a way. If that help hadn't been an option, I probably would have just planned better.

Again, I don't have a lot of info to go on, so please excuse my condescenscion, but without more details to the story, it just sounds like you didn't know how to spend within your limits. You brought up that rather incredible -$3500 figure in the first place, so it's not as if there isn't a bit of a mystery going on here.

However, it sounds like you don't have any interest in truly clarifying the reality of your circumstances, so I'll just drop the line of questioning. Sorry if I offended you."

* Although there is a maximum limit on the transaction size, the radio aspect makes it suitable for mass scanning. The low transaction size implies that any given customer is unlikely to spot the anomalous charge, and then probably only weeks after the event.

ironic_mustache_ride,chicago,1389305580.0,"What about Quinn makes you have a negative opinion of him?

From what I've seen he's a solid moderate who was given the shit job of having to unfuck decades of corruption and in the meantime, made some solid decisions (gay marriage, medical MJ legalized), butted heads with general assembly when he wouldn't pay them until they produced a solid pension reform plan (good effort by him anyway). He's not popular because he is not a game player, and I personally would love to see someone in office who is more to the left, but will settle for someone who isn't bat shit cray cray (Blago), or more crooked than a question mark (George Ryan). 

I'm personally saddened by the pension decision. Imo, people who depend on their pensions were fucked over not by Quinn, but by the previous governors who left the pension to be someone else's problem.  Had anyone taken a stand years ago the consequences would not have been so far reaching, but of course this would have been politically unpopular, and shit, those Gov's had bribes to collect. No room for integrity when you're trying to make dat chedda. 

Quinn is not popular because he doesn't play the games. He makes tough decisions that no one else had the balls to make, and still finds time to make net positive moves for the state. So while I don't agree with him on an ideological level I would be happy to keep him on board for a few more years. 

I saw him at the blackhawks rally over the summer, it was sickeningly obvious how much his rivals want Quinn to be seen as an unpopular Governor. When he got onstage there was a small group of people toward the front of the crowed that boo'd the shit out of him through his speech. Sad that the game players could not put their bullshit aside during a city-wide celebration. "

That being said, and I don't mean this in a disrespectful way, but I highly doubt your sister had actual intentions of committing suicide. I get the impression this was more a cry for help. Suicide victims tend to  give away possessions for quite some time leading up to their suicide attempt, and they also tend to do something lethal (ten Tylenol might make you puke but you ain't gonna die).

With that in mind, this is a cry for help that *should* be taken seriously. From what she wrote in her diary it sounds like she may have a form of bipolar disorder, and may currently be experiencing a manic episode. Just as a quick intro to bipolar, mania, the ""highs"" of bipolar, is the same root word from which we get ""maniac"". Basically, when one is manic, one is incredibly confident, thrill-seeking, impulsive, and reckless. They own the world and can do whatever they please and you *will not* convince them otherwise.

Really though a diagnosis you can trust can only come from a licensed professional. She'll be seeing a therapist (or multiple therapists) during her stay in the psychiatric ward, but I'm going to suggest contacting third party therapists now and setting up a therapy session for when she is released.

I am mentally unwell myself OP - I think it's important for your own psyche that you know it wasn't your sister who swallowed those pills, it was her mental disorder that swallowed them. A lot of people are probably going to want to blame her for these actions, and she's going to need support and understanding from those closest to her.

Again, I wish you and your family well."

If that's what the company does, and it appears to be common, then I see no issue with that.  Plenty of people I work with refer to PL as ""Vacation Time"".  Additionally, boss's hands might be tied and has to charge PL/PTO/Vacation.

I'm calling bullshit on the forced to resign.  In most states, if not all, forcing resignation is illegal since it disqualifies you from unemployment benefits.  If it's not BS, I'd immediately call a lawyer (most lawyers who work in this type of law offer free consultations) and ask what to do if it happens (make him fire you, resign and sue, etc.).

I think what is more likely is a miscommunication where his boss said something like, it's fine for him to take time off if he needs it, and if he's still distraught on his return he will need to take a leave of absence."

He wants to be worthy of the men he admires, attractive to the women who arouse him, and satisfied that it's okay to take a rest and enjoy the down time. You probably feel quite similarly, and that is a crucial common ground between you.

Your doctor's decision to override your emotional system has consequences that impair all of those motivations in both of you. If your counseling program does not find a way to fill in the gaps created by the short-circuiting of your emotions, then it is causing harm at a great rate. Your man is hiding his feelings from you because you two are not meeting on that common ground. He feels ashamed that you can't be happy being married to him, and the easiest way to counteract those feelings is to find a way to recover the sensuality he longs for.

Your depression stems from self-criticism in your head. It is probably a recording of criticism you received early in life; maybe a judgmental mother, an alcoholic/irrational father, or a sibling with a very different personality than you. Church and school leaders are also common sources of those early-life recorded messages. None of it begin with the life you lead today. So nothing your man does has any impact.

Few things undermine the shaky, stereotypical masculine personality (that we are taught to emulate) as much as being unable to acquire your approval. Few things can suppress the internal self-hatred that comes from that inability. Masturbation is a surprisingly effective coping mechanism.

If you want to see him return to more normal behavior and be more open to negotiating with you, then figure out how to make him feel admirable. If that sounds like the opposite of what you've been trying, then I hope you recognize the ineffectiveness of the way you've been treating him. If you don't take a goal-oriented approach in this matter, it will not improve.

So how do you make a guy feel admirable? You have to provide sincere external validation of his decisions. Have someone praise his favorite jacket. Go talk to his boss and ask why he hasn't gotten some recognition for all his hard work. Find a way to inject your (manufactured, perhaps) surprise at how he handled some problem. 

I hope you feel like you just want to make it better because you love him. Read past my dumb words and try to feel the truth of what  I mean. He wants to be with you so badly that he's willing to simmer in terrible conditions. It probably depresses him that he needs to overcome his emotions to feel happy. It will probably enliven him if you find a way to make him feel good about himself. But aim high. After all, you never want to discover too late that you could have made it work but instead just decided to watch it end.

You are not at fault, but you have a chance to change his life. Be the change you want to see in this world.

Hope that helps."

TheIdesOfLight,blackladies,1389305795.0,"&gt; The side note: I know one of the other mods reblogged this already, but can we just take a moment to think about what had happened. And I know this is really obvious, but like Eartha Kitt, a Black woman spits truth, something that is real and deep and meaningful, and a white woman begins to cry, presumably because she found it as a personal attack. This doesn’t cause people who think critically about the white women’s reaction, or about the truth behind this Black woman’s words, it causes sympathy for the white women and literally harms the Black woman. Because in the United States white women’s tears and feelings are literally the pinnacle of what we should find sympathetic. Not kids being sent off to war, to kill people. But the tears of a white woman. Now I know that part of this is the patriarchal assumption that women need to be protected and nurtured, but it’s also part of the racist-ass structure of the United States in which “women” means “white women.” Would President Johnson and his wife’s careers and lives have been put on hold if Eartha Kitt had burst into tears over her children being sent to war to kill people? Hellllllllll to the no. But show a white woman crying, and suddenly everyone involved is a villain.

Nowhere does the paper indicate obese people are doomed. Sure, they will probably end up putting weight back on but the controls, on average, put on weight too. So ultimately, they still may have ended up thinner than they would have been had they never went on the diet.

potato1,TwoXChromosomes,1389306013.0,"&gt;In practice, when there's no good reason to believe something is true, we simply regard it as false (even if we can't prove that it's false). In practice, we should treat religious beliefs as false.

I'm not telling you you should believe anything, and in fact you probably shouldn't, but claiming that no religious beliefs whatsoever are factually true is to ignore that religious beliefs are metaphysical claims, and therefore completely unprovable. Under falsificationism, the foundation of modern philiosophy of science, that makes them *unscientific,* and therefore neither false nor true. To claim that all unprovable statements can be assumed false goes against modern philosophy of science. In practice, you may as well treat whatever you don't see evidence for as false in your personal life, but in a conversation like this one, asserting that all religious beliefs are false is misguided.

Your man wants to admire himself. He wants to be worthy of the men he admires, attractive to the women who arouse him, and satisfied that it's okay to take a rest and enjoy the down time. You probably feel quite similarly, and that is a crucial common ground between you.

Your doctor's decision to override your emotional system has consequences that impair all of those motivations in both of you. If your counseling program does not find a way to fill in the gaps created by the short-circuiting of your emotions, then it is causing harm at a great rate. Your man is hiding his feelings from you because you two are not meeting on that common ground. He feels ashamed that you can't be happy being married to him, and the easiest way to counteract those feelings is to find a way to recover the sensuality he longs for.

Your depression stems from self-criticism in your head. It is probably a recording of criticism you received early in life; maybe a judgmental mother, an alcoholic/irrational father, or a sibling with a very different personality than you. Church and school leaders are also common sources of those early-life recorded messages. None of it begin with the life you lead today. So nothing your man does has any impact.

Few things undermine the shaky, stereotypical masculine personality (that we are taught to emulate) as much as being unable to acquire your approval. Few things can suppress the internal self-hatred that comes from that inability. Masturbation is a surprisingly effective coping mechanism.

If you want to see him return to more normal behavior and be more open to negotiating with you, then figure out how to make him feel admirable. If that sounds like the opposite of what you've been trying, then I hope you recognize the ineffectiveness of the way you've been treating him. If you don't take a goal-oriented approach in this matter, it will not improve.

So how do you make a guy feel admirable? You have to provide sincere external validation of his decisions. Have someone praise his favorite jacket. Go talk to his boss and ask why he hasn't gotten some recognition for all his hard work. Find a way to inject your (manufactured, perhaps) surprise at how he handled some problem. 

I hope you feel like you just want to make it better because you love him. Read past my dumb words and try to feel the truth of what  I mean. He wants to be with you so badly that he's willing to simmer in terrible conditions. It probably depresses him that he needs to overcome his emotions to feel happy. It will probably enliven him if you find a way to make him feel good about himself. But aim high. After all, you never want to discover too late that you could have made it work but instead just decided to watch it end.

You are not at fault, but you have a chance to change his life. Be the change you want to see in this world.

Hope that helps."

I do this till I get 100 antimatter condensers and the upgrade that unlocks, and then I save up and continue buying temporary pledges until I hit the amount of cookies I want to reset with. Last time it was 100qa, this time I'll try for 150 or 200. Before I reset I sell all my buildings for the extra cookies they net me.

miked4o7,DotA2,1389306077.0,"&gt;The idea of steam is great, and it's success has little to do with the way valve is run. What competition did they have from the start? Steam was shit for years (and not shit like origin, but really really bad) when they started to force it on people with CS 1.6.

You don't think that Valve's structure has anything at all to do with the way that decisions are made, with figuring out how projects progress, how projects are canceled, or how projects are kept going for long stretches of time even when it's not directly profitable to do so?

Pretty much everything Gabe as ever said about the way that Valve works directly contradicts this.


&gt;And going public wasn't whether or not they were succesful but rather to have you ask yourself what investment bankers would tell Valve to do as to be more appealing to investors.

Right, but the fact that Valve is *not* public makes this irrelevant.  If anything, what you're arguing for here is not the limitations imposed by Valve's structure, but the limitations imposed by going public."

Zel606,financialindependence,1389306090.0,"I have to echo the ""normal"" aspect.

As great as homeschooling ""can"" be in some aspects, those children are often deprived of the adequate social skills to properly interact with their peers, making it difficult to make friends.

They do make friends, but their social skills are stunted by the lack of interactions.

I highly recommend starting a charter school, or if the parents can find a few other like minded in their city they could pay a few private tutors to teach small classes to their kids and create their own 1 class school for their child.  I realize this can be an undertaking, but its just one of many compromises available to the parents to achieve their goals.

I'm personally against standardized tests and firmly believe they are the bane of great education.  Unfortunately we've tried turning school into an assembly line, thereby trying to grade the end results in some standardized way."

Before this happens, you need to push them to sign a rental/lease agreement that protects your interests so you have recourse. Spell out your message in detail. Put reasonable consequences for non-compliance.

&gt;a ""last hurrah"" for a condemned man

This isn't it at all (as /u/diet_mountain_dew [rightly pointed out below](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1usc0z/opinion_on_fianc%C3%A9_going_to_a_strip_club_for_a/celjknz)).  The party is not for the bachelor, it's for his buddies.  The ""last hurrah"" isn't for a ""condemned man,"" it's a last hurrah for the relationship he had with his friends, which will necessarily change as he takes on the role of a husband.  

The bachelor party is their last chance to abduct their friend, get him uncomfortably drunk, and have an irresponsibly good time with him.

&gt;It was a problem for a couple of his friends who thought I was a major buzzkill for ruining *their* imagined fun, since he was the first in his peer group to get married and they had seen a lot of stupid movies.

I'm glad you and your husband were on the same wavelength in this matter, but it would really upset me if my partner felt this way about my friends."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1389306189.0,"I remember as a kid, my best friend was from a Mexican background. I once asked him, ""Hey, what's it like always having white people on TV when you're brown?"" He responded with, ""What are you talking about? We have like 5 channels dedicated to brown people."" 

Years later I hooked back up with him and mentioned how that conversation must have gone completely over his head when we were kids. I was trying to ask what it's like being a minority around a lot of white people who clearly dominate the social narrative. His response was basically, ""No, I understood the question just fine. It was just a stupid question. Obviously white people were all over the media -- I wouldn't be asking why there are so many brown people on TV in Mexico. That's just life. It was a stupid question to be honest. What if you were in China and I asked you about what it's like being white when all the media has yellow people all over (his words)? It doesn't mean anything, you're in their country so it's expected. I was just trying to point out that I at least had some Mexican programming, which is nice."" He works in finance now and has a gaggle of half brown Mexican kids with an amazing RP wife. 

The point is -- and what I took away from that conversation -- racism does exist at an institutional level. You'd have to be fucking retarded to think it doesn't. It does. For instance, blacks and whites mirror each other on drug abuse rates (in fact, it's pretty equal across the animal kingdom) yet blacks have a 5 time higher incarceration rate for drug use. It sucks, and is frankly detrimental to our social fabric. But that's a separate issue all together. 

Minorities do see the the challenge. It's not something they aren't aware of. Just like people here who are realizing that the seduction game goes by a separate set of rules, so does being a minority. Yes, it sucks having those rules, but that's life. You can either bitch about it, or understand it and leverage it. Yes, if you're born as a minority in this nation, you're likely to have a more difficult time becoming successful than a rich white kid (shocker). But at the end of the day, you can bitch until you're blue in the face, it's not going to change that reality. All the successful minorities of the world recognize this low income stable they are in, and understand that if they want out, they'll have to work harder than most. Simply asking the stable owner to buy nicer things for the place isn't going to solve the problem. Only hard work will.

That's why I think TRP is different than places like MRA and Feminism subs. They aren't trying to equip themselves for the real world, but are instead crying at the world hoping for it to change to suit them. Yes, you should bitch a little and push for change, but at the same time recognize change takes a while and it doesn't happen overnight. In the meantime, you need to understand how the system is played and do what you have to do.

Right now, I'm in the midst of raising 250k for a company I want to start from the ground up. A feminist/MRA will sit back and bitch about how hard it is, and how it's not fair that trust fund kids can do it w/o much effort. Me, on the other hand, recognizes, ""Hey, I don't have 250k in liquid equity. If I want to make this business happen, I have to figure out how to make it happen."" Instead, feminists/MRA will just start a Tumblr and bitch about how the government doesn't give them a quarter million to start their stupid little bracelet company -- and when it fails, it's because it's not fair that everyone is buying the better bracelets, and people should instead be forced to buy bracelets on an equal basis. 

I feel like white women almost want to feel objectified and discriminated against. They want to feel this to rationalize their shitty situation in life. They don't want to compete and deal with their boring life, they want to find an excuse of why they are lazy. ""Oh, I'm fat and people don't like fat people! It's NOT FAIR!"" Well, stop being fat. WTF is wrong with you? It literally takes a lack of action. It's the opposite of laziness. Just stop fucking eating so much you pig. ""Oh, men only like hot girls."" Well, lucky for you, you're a chick, and there is an entire industry around being attractive. I've yet to meet an unattractive woman that couldn't be attractive with a little work. But sorry to tell you, it starts with growing your hair out, not using black lipstick, and throwing away those stupid boots. ""Oh, but I like to be comfortable. It's not fair that I have to be attractive all the time,"" Yeah, well me neither. I'd like to wear gym shorts and sandals everywhere I went. But then people would think I'm a fucking slob.

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1389306268.0,"Gotta be honest OP, I think it's more that she's afraid of being single again, and is showing you this attention in an attempt to convince you that the marriage is worth saving.

Personally, I'd go through with the divorce, mainly because of her comments about never being sexually interested. That's just hurtful, that's not something one decent person says to another, let alone their SO and co-parent to their children. That just comes across to me as malicious.

That being said, it's your marriage OP, and if you genuinely do love this woman it's not worth ending your relationship just so you can sleep around. I mean that's fun and all, but it's not nearly as fun as it looks from an outside perspective. Grass is greener, blah blah blah.

SpagNMeatball,DIY,1389306301.0,"[Here is a calculator](http://www.stevegs.com/utils/beltcalc.htm) you can use.   
I am no expert on the actual calculations, but I know putting a larger gear on the motor and smaller gear on the brushes makes the brushes spin faster than the motor.  If you put a smaller gear on the motor and a larger gear on the brushes, the brushes spin slower.

Again, I'm not an expert, but I think you want the motor to run at its designed RPM (1750), then change the gears to make the brushes turn at whatever RPM you want. I suspect that you want the brushes turning slower.  You may actually need a bigger motor. 

Based on the calculator-   
When they were all 19, the brushes were spinning at 1750 RPM
  
When the Motor was at 40, The brushes should be at 3684 RPM

If Motor is 19 and Brushes are 30 then Brush RPM is 1108

You need to find a balance between the RPM and the power of the motor. You may need some more calculations to determine the power required to turn the brushes at a specific RPM, then match the motor to that. But I'm not sure how to do that.

The good news is that current hardware is so powerful this is less an issue than it was, lets say five years ago. In addition, Windows 7 and even more so, Windows 8 do a good job of staying fit.

You'd probably have to wipe a box with Windows XP every year or two to keep it running fast.

Then there's all the loader services and applications that come with modern games.

Look into cleaning up your start-up - programs that launch automatically when you boot up your pc - you can do this in task manager (CTRL+Shift+ESC) under the start-up tab, and turn off anything that you deem unnecessary.

I had been trekking for a while, running with friends from Elektro's power plant to the North West Air Field. I was all geared up and was nice and happy. I ended up sitting on top of the radio tower for a while with no issues, until I saw something...

...two tiny moving figures at the northern end of the runway. They were two friends, one being kitted out in army gear and the other with an orange raincoat and blue jeans. I tracked them for a while as they ran around until the army guy stopped and orange raincoat man ran ahead. As soon as he stopped, I fired and killed him instantly. The raincoat man immediately combat logged (as I was then about to fire on him), and I thought no more of it.

I go down to loot the body and all of a sudden, I hear about three or four M4's going off. One was my friend, shooting at people. I asked who they were, and he told me: ""They're all wearing army gear except one guy in an orange jacket"" - the guy had combat logged, got a bunch of friends and came to hunt me down. I immediately made a mad dash for the radio tower and my friend stayed on top of the fire station with his M4 while I sniped from the office below the top deck of the tower.

You can say a lot about this whole darknet market community, but professionalism is not one of its traits.

Personally, I think at this point the most pragmatic solution is to completely decouple the marketplace and the escrow business. BTC provides native escrow facilities, without relying on a third party (thus allowing to steal BTC). The problem is that marketplaces get greedy, and the status quo puts the marketplace in control.

A marketplace should just be for supply and demand to get in touch with each other (like eBay), and nothing more."

md619,AskMen,1389306484.0,"&gt; There are asexual people out there. Yes, there are. Women and men. They enjoy companionship and romantic attachment, but have a low or nonexistent sex drive, or aren't motivated sexually.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; There are tons of men who would say (note the difference here) ""I don't want to just get laid; I want to be in a relationship."" This includes some sensitive types, sure ... but it also includes men who might self-identify as ""sex addicts,"" men who are bored with endless one-night stands, older men who don't run around with hard-ons all day long, etc.

These are all exceptions that no guy would probably comment on anyway if he knew. I'm only saying a generality exists, not that it makes sense 100% of the time.

&gt;Also, there are a lot of women that don't like man whores, because they don't want to be used as a human masturbation toy then discarded along with the condom. They want men who want to actually spend time with them that doesn't involve getting him off. 

Sure, women don't want to get used. But most of them will take that risk in the moment if the guy is attractive enough anyway. You don't think all the girls who throw themselves at movie or rockstars know what's most likely going to happen? Women want to fuck too.

&gt;On a related note, there are actually men out there who want a woman to talk to, not just use as a conquest. Vaginas are indeed awesome, but - guess what - the women they're attached to are awesome as well. Funny, insightful, supportive, caring, fun, smart, and getting to know them can actually make you a better person. 

Sure, some of them have those qualities. You've left out all the negatives though. It's a fallacy anyway. I can't get to know a girl unless I'm committed to her?

&gt;Do I want to sleep with a ton of women? Honestly, no. It's a hassle. The kind of women that give in to bed-post-notchers are usually gross. It's really no more fulfilling than masturbation, which doesn't come with the expense, mess, time, and consequences of bagging Lady Beer Goggles.

It can be a hassle but everything you just said after that is so wrong I'm starting to question if you've ever gotten laid before. And no, that one time you got drunk and fucked a fat girl doesn't count.

&gt;The best sexual satisfaction comes from a sexual relationship, and that doesn't get achieved in one night. It takes time figuring your partner's body out, and for her to figure yours out, and - if you work on it - you'll have the most mind-blowing sex in a monogamous relationship that no amount of one-night stands will ever equal.

You honestly believe that? Sex rarely never gets better after a long time in a relationship. Usually it's the opposite. What happens is that when it starts out, it's new and exciting. But eventually you've fucked that girl every way you can imagine and then some. It's fucking hard to keep that spark alive, especially if you start out on a high note."

Wolf_Stansson_DDS,AskReddit,1389306532.0,"I agree with many of the points you made.  If I happen to repost this, I will make some changes. Making a point to emphasize that doesn't represent every restaurant is important.  I will state that it is more representative of a standard mom and pop restaurant.

I will also concede that the one wrong bit of information said was typical food costs.  I am not a chef.  I am a businessman, and an expert cook for my specific niche only.  I know my niche extremely well, but I am not a food-service lifer.  In fact, at this point, I have another job and only do back office stuff.

You're using atypical numbers to refute some of mine too, though.  Let's assume for this that it is your typical mom and pop non-chain restaurant.  Sandwich shops, pizza places, Chinese places, etc.  I don't want to use a place like Chili's because they can get away with charging more and because they probably do enough volume to change their costs quite a bit.  I think most people would understand why McDonald's is able to charge $1 for any size drink (insanely high volume), and why Chili's can charge $2.99 (you are stuck there, and can't go to the convenience store down the street.  Plus, people stay longer at restaurants like this and will likely get more than one refill).  

The absolute highest you will see in my area (Denver, which I would guess is much closer to the country-wide average than CT) is $1.99.  The $3.00 example might be true on the East Coast, but again, I'd guess most of the country is a whole lot closer to $1.69 than $3.00.  I will downsize the size to 16 oz, but again, my original post specified that it was accurate for **my restaurant**.  Adding a caveat that these are my costs and my costs alone would help clear this up, but this isn't crazy low.  It is pretty close to the average costs in my market.  In fact, I just looked it up and my main competitors charge $1.69 for a 21 oz drink, and $1.50 for a 21 oz. drink.  My $1.69 for a 24 oz. drink is right in line with the market.  I looked up a few sandwich shops around the country (Georgia and Minnesota) and their prices were right in line with my competitors.

1. I know that equipment cost is not part of food cost.  As I explained before, this is a substitute for the cost of ice.  I don't use energy or water in my food costs in my accounting, but to the layperson, I am explaining that there is a cost here.  If I didn't serve soft drinks, I wouldn't have to have an ice machine and my energy and water usage would go down.  Since you've brought up this point about nine times, I'll ignore the substitute.

2. Using a reusable glass isn't a fair comparison, because my whole point was that cups, lids and straws cost money and are a factor in the pricing of soda.  Again, this is for a quick serve restaurant.  Lots of to-go orders, plus even when I give them a reusable cup on an eat-in order, many patrons request a to-go cup at the end of their meal to get one for the road.  At a minimum, they are using a straw.  Sticking with these costs.

3.  Not counting water, as I didn't in my original post.
 
&gt; If you look at just a single glass of soda, at a restaurant, you're lucky to get 10oz of soda

4.  This is by far the most incorrect assumption in your response.  We aren't looking at a single glass of soda, we are looking at the average consumer who gets, as I said 1.5 or 1 refills.  Even with a small drink (small is 16 oz. medium is 21 oz, large is 24 oz), we are looking at a minimum average of 16 oz.  **My market** will typically be about $1.69 for a medium (21 oz.) and $1.99 for a large (24 oz.).  I will overcompensate for this by shrinking the size in my analysis to 16 oz.

 Going with only the syrup costs.  Keeping it $.017/oz.  McDonald's and Chili's and even small chains get it cheaper, but going with a real number that a standard mom and pop would get.  The vast majority of people get one or more refills.  I'm betting that it is even more at sit-down restaurants.  In their analysis, my Pepsi rep used 1.5 refills as the average based on data they have collected.  Even if it is only one refill, as my original post said, your 10 oz example are just flat out wrong.  In my example I used a 24 oz cup because that's what I use.  This is putting you at 24 oz of soda as a conservative estimate, 36 oz as the average an expert used.  We are going to be conservative and call it a $1.69 16 oz. soda.  They are using a conservative average of 16 oz, and a more likely average of 24 oz.

Again, this is for a mom and pop type restaurant that uses to go cups.

Here is my revised breakdown that is absolutely typical for the average restaurant in my market.

* Cup- 7 cents
* Lid- 3 cents
* Straw- 2 cents
* Syrup- 27 cents (16 oz at 1.7 cents per oz. [~$68 for a 5 gal BiB, yielding 3840 finished oz, at a ratio of 5 to 1 water to syrup])

For a total of 39 cents, or a food cost of 23%, or about 4.6 times higher than the example I refuted. When you compare this to the more accurate target food cost that you were so kind as to provide, it is a whopping 5% higher margin than their food.  Yes, it is still a high margin, but it isn't 95% and isn't really that high compared to food costs, **which was my point**.

If they get 1.5 refills (again, the industry average according to a third party expert), the cost rises to 52.8 cents, which gives us 69% margins, or 1% higher than my original post.


I appreciate your breakdown here, and that you are civilly contributing to the discourse, but I stand by my point and almost everything in my original post other than industry standard food costs.  

I will admit that my 24 oz soda for $1.69 is a little bit cheap, but considering that the closest competitors are $1.50 for 21oz, and $1.69 for 21 oz,  it isn't too far off the mark.

In the future, I will make my point using even more conservative estimates, but the point stands.

What we have done and what I think he is suggesting is made a sister clan for the play station guys. We all use the same sub and discuss things about the game and even have some cross platform members. With the limited size of clans and the fact that they already have a solid 80 try hard mother fuckers on the Xbox where exactly do you see space for a ton of play station recruits? If the clan limit size was increased you may have a valid point about joining the main clan (just like casual would merge the Playstation and Xbox clans) but as it stands now there is no room.

It seems like you have more of a problem than just not having space in the clan for play station guys though and legitimately don't like Reddit Black. So why even make all this fuss? Join another reddit clan that is active on the PS3/4 (reddit east perhaps) or try and find more like minded individuals to start up a tryhard clan similar to reddit black. If you get a decent set of members and can show weed thumb (the leader of rBLK who I believe has a PS4) that you guys are serious and have talent I am sure he will seriously consider a sister clan deal like reddit casual has.

TL;DR: there's no room in the current clan for a decent sized Playstation clan so join a clan that has a Playstation division or try and make another clan to hopefully join black at a later date. "

Is it actually work? I wouldn't say it requires ""dedication"". Yes, a friendship doesn't grow by its own but you actually enjoy it while you develop it, the best way to develop a friendship is while you both are doing other things while together.

It usually is a succession of a small steps, usually involving quite a lot of small talk while discovering and sharing interests.

Secondly, it's not illegal to be high, it's the usual charges the police slap on (disturbing the peace, public intoxication, DUI, ect.) while under the influence that get you. 

Now, there are some jobs that don't require drug tests, and along with that, they take the responsibility and liability of potentially having employees who occasionally show up to work high. Because of that, the employer then can't run to the government and demand they be compensated since they didn't require drug tests and assumed all responsibility. 

So, considering he sneakily passed the drug test, and we're back to post 1 where it it'll end up costing more in attorney fees to get hard proof that this guy illegally purchased drugs. It's best to just cut your losses and go the least taxing route."

Gollygoshdarnscurvy,AskWomen,1389307003.0,"Depends.  I am kind of anti-social, so most of the time I'd bring a book so that well-meaning, wonderful, friendly people (male and female) wouldn't try and strike up a conversation.  But I certainly was never *offended* by it, and usually ended up being glad they had made the effort, despite my being a turtle.  I talked to a lot of guys that I really wasn't romantically interested in, but enjoyed talking to nonetheless.  

With one exception.  There was one guy who I swear just LIVED there, and would hit on any freshman girl sitting alone.  He would just carry around refills of juice, moving from table to table as each girl left.  He was the main reason I started bringing a book.  It was weird.  He was also like 30.  That is not the main reason it was creepy, but it was a not-unimportant secondary reason.  I felt like he thought girls were a sort of gazelle, to pick off from the edge of the herd.  He informed me, unasked, of the best make-out locations in the library, and told me I was soooooo pretty.  

In short: talking to people is nice!  Strike up a conversation.  Suss out whether or not you'd like to get to know them better.  If you would, do so.  *Do not* slide in and go straight to ""You're hot!"" And if she doesn't want to talk, leave her alone.

A few years ago there were several people demonstrating 30m read capability, but I can't track them down and I do see multiple sites saying that this is a difference between RFID and NFC. It is possible that they were showing this on RFID and assuming that the results transferred over. I'm not saying that this is the case, but I haven't found the citations that I expected. I may have to build some kit to test this myself.

On tracking - the difference is that with a chip and PIN, you have to plug the card in. I'm thinking of something more like the shoplifter detection gates common fitted at the exits to shops: since these already work on RFID, it would be fairly simple to repurpose them to acquire your card id every time you pass. Shopping malls are already tracking phones to get similar data, but they can't usually associate these with individuals. (To confirm this last point, you may find a small sheet of A4 pinned up obscurely near the exit to a shopping mall where you are unlikely to notice it - e.g. in the Oracle in Reading)."

Admiration is also an unusual word to use. I tend to only admire those I aspire to be like. Admiration and Aspiration are strongly interconnected (for me at least). If I admire someone, it's usually another man who has had success in life, and whose success I aspire to emulate.

I'm assuming you mean why do scorpions and lobster have 8 walking legs and two claws at the anterior (head end) with all legs attached to the cephalothorax.  But in reality, that's where the similiarities stop.  The body plans of both, when examining them, and how they come to be evolutionarily, are actually quite different.

In decapods, all 10 legs are true legs, including the front claws (the chelae).  You'd think that the chelae in scorpions are also legs, but really the chelae of the scorpions are actually pedipalps which, in arachnids, are [homologous to the second pair antennae of crustaceans, the big antennae; meaning the presence of them is evidence of shared ancestry between the groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedipalp).  Therefore they are arachnids and not a decapod because the claws aren't a leg, but a modified pedipalp.  Thus, these are not the same claws as what we see in the Astacidean and Brachyuran/anomuran crustaceans.  However, they do perform an analogous purpose.

I don't know too much about comparative anatomy and evolutionary morphology, so I'm going to let somebody else chime in there.  But I just wanted you to know that while they may appear similar in body structure, they really aren't all *that* similar as you think!

To be honest mate - if it's a case of her wanting to get out of the relationship, and she uses *that* excuse - the holiest of holy insults - then I'm sorry but she's vermin.

She's deliberately trying to hurt you for some reason, or she is profoundly *profoundly* uncompassionate - in either case, you're better off in the long run.

No Ottawa defenceman has negated as many breakaways as EK has since his norris season and he's been fantastic defensively, however he can't shake his reputation of being a liability no matter what he does.

He's not Chara, but he's far from a liability and is definitely not just a one-dimensional player. His speed allows him to catch up to nearly any player even when he does choose the wrong time to pinch. Only thing he doesn't do is hit often, but when he does it's because he has a golden opportunity. "

6 No, you order the drink. In our free society women are free to make their decisions and speak their opinions and desires EXCEPT in a bar. In the bar, women revert to their roles from the year 1952 and you order her a cosmopolitan and tell her to be quiet when the men are talking.

WTF is wrong with you? It literally takes a lack of action. It's the opposite of laziness. Just stop fucking eating so much you pig. ""Oh, men only like hot girls."" Well, lucky for you, you're a chick, and there is an entire industry around being attractive. I've yet to meet an unattractive woman that couldn't be attractive with a little work.

Before this, I even agreed that there was a level of undue discrimination. It exists. Logical, it's fucked. But at the end of the day, this is how the game is played. I don't give a fuck as to why things are right, and why things are wrong. I want to be successful in this jungle of life. Is there a double standard with men and women? Yes, yes there are many. Are they justified? Yes, most of them are. But it doesn't matter. At the end of the day, it's very fucking clear an overwhelming majority of men don't like sluts.

porpoiseoflife,lotro,1389307736.0,"I only have lower level experience, as my main is still only level 73, so I can't comment on the endgame portions yet. But I can comment on the early-game experiences.

First, my favorites:

* **Minstrel**: I find it to be a very fun and easy class. Once you get past the initial 10 levels, the Mini is capable of opening up some significant cans of whoop-ass on anything short of a multiple pull of Elites. The rotation is easy: Piercing Cry, Minor Ballad, Perfect Ballad, Minor Ballad, Coda. Lather, rinse, repeat. If you're fast, you can pull off the whole thing in 5 seconds, and that's a lot of hurt in a short time. Healing is simple and direct, and groups always love healers to join up.   
* **Burlgar**: I'm a sneaky person in real life, so stealth classes usually mesh well with my personality. Burgs are fun, but not at all easy. You have to think about the fight constantly, using your stuns and your tricks whenever they are open. The best secret I've found is to never let the mobs get the upper hand. Stay on top of them or you are in for a lot longer of a fight than you wanted, and a burg does not fare well in a long 1-on-1 fight.  
* **Guardian**: Leveling guards got whacked upside the head with the nerf stick with the huge update, at least in comparison to before. I've gone to exclusively sword-and-board fighting so that Shield Slam is handy, mostly because SS is one of the hardest hitting skills in the arsenal. Haven't tried tanking with it yet. Almost afraid to.  
* **Champion**: *All I wanna do is shinga-shing-shing-shing and a boom-boom. Yeah, shake your butt!* If it absolutely positively has to be destroyed overnight, ship Champ Express. I don't always leave a bloody trail of destruction and chaos wherever I walk. But when I do, I play a champion. Nonstop violence is the forte of the Champ. Don't think. Just kill.  

What I don't like: 

* **Hunter**: There's too much standing around involved for my tastes, and I couldn't get one past Lone Lands without throwing my hands up in disgust and deleting it. That and you can't throw a rock in Bree-town without hitting 15 of them. There's too many Hunters in game, and the world would be a better place if people would stop making them.  
* **Loremasters**: I can see why this might be a good class... Only I fail miserably at any and all pet classes. I respect those that can pull it off, but they aren't for me. Period.  
* **Captains**: See above.   
* **Wardens**: I've found this to be needlessly complex. I don't need 35 different ways of killing something. I just need four or five. Props to those that can manage it, but I just can't take the constant yammering inside my head of 1-3-1-3-2-4 2-1-3-1-2-4 2-3-1-2-3-4 over and over and over again.  

Finally, there are Runekeepers. I haven't tried them yet. Maybe my next TP grinding toon will be an RK, just so I can give it a nice test drive."

If you have trouble coughing up the phlegm, bend over at the waist when you cough so gravity can help you out. And as far as antibiotics go, they kill off all bacteria, including the good kind.

Aleysia,AskWomen,1389307850.0,"I think the thing to keep in mind is that a mark of immaturity is when a person cherry-picks evidence to supports the point they want to make, and angrily refuses to consider anything to the contrary. A ""reasonable-sounding"" explanation is *not* difficult for humans to construct and doesn't necessarily have to do anything with reality (e.g. think about all the stories that are created around religion and gods).

Don't get caught up in his certainty that he is right. It literally means absolutely nothing and simply exists in his head, and you'll realize that after you get some distance and perspective. 

One of the things that traps you in the relationship is the unstated belief that his well-being is a complex and important thing, and yours is like that of pet dog or something (his happiness is your happiness, he doesn't need to concern himself with understanding let alone accommodating your opinions/feelings, you should just get over bad incidents, you should love him no matter what and be satisfied to have a relationship, etc.).

No matter how much you care about him, realize that nothing requires you to put up with... THAT. You may feel like you ought to, but I'm here to tell you that it's not true. It's a huge problem, but one that is not yours and cannot be fixed by you. Let go. 

Edit: And whatever thing you feel like have right now with him... there are a lot of other people in the world who will treat you so well in comparison that you'll be shocked at what you put up with now.

dakru,AskMen,1389307923.0,"&gt; Why would women find a married man more attractive???

Pre-selection. A man will generally be more attractive to any particular woman if she knows that other women want him."
pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1389307924.0,"It's a paradox because casting a wide net is a necessity if you are going to get any responses, since a lot of what goes into whether women respond is arbitrary, and the chances are low. Yet, at the same time, it's such a turn off to women to think that a guy is contacting so many women, personalized messages or not. Understand that you're sort of screwed and don't get down on yourself for it. 

Sending personalized messages is good. Make sure you really look through her profile and comment on things about her. Compliment her looks but more importantly, compliment her brain. The best compliment I have ever received is when someone told me they like the way I think. And remember that ultimately the biggest compliment is for you to show interest in her life, her goals, the things she cares about. 

Women, like most people - but especially women, really hate to feel pressured. So I think a good strategy is to drop her a compliment that shows you looked at her profile, suggest a date idea that has something to do with her interests, and then leave the ball in her court. I would be careful about asking questions unless they are really playful ones, because from a woman's perspective, why do I owe you an answer? I have no idea who you are. Questions are a form of pressure. Pressure makes me feel awkward, and feeling awkward makes me run away.

Maybe you can also suggest interesting date ideas. If it were me, this would catch my interest and I would think, hey, at least I get to do something cool. Also, the sooner you meet in person, the better. Chatting, messaging, texting, calling --- they are all messy and awkward. 

Try not to say to much about yourself in your messages. Let your profile do the talking. To me, guys who try to sell themselves is a turn off. And no, there are not types of bragging that are more acceptable than others. I've had guys try to talk about what caring and loyal boyfriends they are, and they just end up sounding conceited and, at best, desperate. 

If it helps you, don't think of all the unreturned emails and messages as rejections. Women just get so many of them that we don't look at most of them. So whether we respond is largely based on chance.

wordserious,WritingPrompts,1389308100.0,"I like silence, and that was the main reason why I chose my career. But the reality was, I was wrong. It was a noisy place, and I should be thankful because that's what saved my life. But let me start from the beginning.

Of all the noises in the world, the two that I really despised were the alarm clock and the vacuum cleaner. Imagine my frustration, rudely awaken from the mother of all hangovers by the combination of those two noises.

What were they thinking, making all that noise that early, and after what had probably been a wild party, judging from the pain throbbing behind my eyes. Unfortunately I couldn’t remember the party, the occasion, or even who had spent the night and was so carelessly vacuuming while the alarm clock blared. I vaguely remembered that I was supposed to be alone. That thought scared me half-awake. There are very few things scarier than realizing you’re not alone when you should be.

First things first: first, stop the blasted alarm clock. Then find and stop the vacuuming intruder. Whoever it was wouldn’t be much of a threat. I mean, who breaks into somebody’s room and starts cleaning? Without opening my eyes, I reached for the table with the intention of destroying the alarm clock to pieces. Or at least shut it down.

Sharp pain stabbed through my fingers as my hand encountered something sharp on the way to the table, way sooner that it had the right to encounter anything. That was not the biggest surprise, though. No, the real surprise was that as soon as my hand met the unknown sharp object my body seemed to take flight in the opposite direction. That was what made me finally open my eyes.

At first I couldn’t make heads or tails of the mess about me. Then my eyes focused on a tiny red fish floating right before my face. I blinked a couple of times, then finally realized that that was no fish: it was a small drop of blood. Instinctively I looked at my hand.

I could see the painful puncture where my finger had met the edge of the life support panel. Life support panel. Life support panel! I refocused my eyes and finally understood the vacuum cleaner noise. Vacuum indeed! The O2 indicator on the life support panel was creeping down toward zero, and then I saw the “hull breach” indicator blinking madly right above it.

Instinct took over and I immediately sealed the inner hatch of the command bubble, hoping that the breach would be somewhere else on the station. The hatch closed with a delicious *clank* and immediately the noise of air being sucked into the vacuum of space stopped.

I silenced the alarm and started venting the outer atmosphere to space. I would need to do that before I could stabilize my orbit, but I figured I had a few hours before my fall to Earth became irreversible."

I don't know what his was made of, but actual battle shields were heavy, wooden or steel, which made them more stable, while prop and larping shields of carbon fiber and whatnot are light and as such much more chaotic.

You don't need to go abroad to find a good quality wife. In fact, if you can't cut it here, you'll just be bringing her here, giving her a green card, and she'll quickly realize you are a bitch and ditch your ass for a real man. That's the truth. I've personally seen it happen.

Now, are you good at playing the game? I've been to Ukraine, and holy shit was it amazing. I thought I was being punked. So many beautiful women, with blonde hair, tall, amazing asses, perky tits, and slim as should be. I was getting pretty much proposed to by solid 9s (It really puts shit into perspective btw).

But this is because I have a level of game. The standard for a place like Russia is very high for women. But if you can't attract a good woman in America, what makes you think you'll get a good one abroad? They are all bitches at the end of the day. You may be able to pickup a good one abroad, but eventually she'll figure out you are a tool just like all the native women have, and next your ass for a real man.

Re. safety of squatting, I can tell you that my knee doesn't have full flexion and I've been told by every physio and ortho I've seen that I probably won't get it, and once I'm within about 10-15 degrees of normal, to stop trying to get more.

p_iynx,fatpeoplestories,1389308312.0,"""The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa is 12 times higher than the death rate of ALL causes of death for females 15 – 24 years old.""

This is from the South Carolina Department of Health. 

Eating disorders also have the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, according to the same page. 

http://www.state.sc.us/dmh/anorexia/statistics.htm


""Although eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder,  the mortality rates reported on those who suffer from eating disorders can vary considerably between studies and sources. Part of the reason why there is a large variance in the reported number of deaths caused by eating disorders is because those who suffer from an eating disorder may ultimately die of heart failure, organ failure, malnutrition or suicide. Often, the medical complications of death are reported instead of the eating disorder that  compromised a person’s health.

According to a study done by colleagues at the American Journal of Psychiatry (2009), crude mortality rates were:

• 4% for anorexia nervosa

• 3.9%  for bulimia nervosa

• 5.2% for eating disorder not otherwise specified

Edit: Downvotes for providing sources. Classy, reddit. Whatever, I'm keeping it up. I'm the only one here who is providing any proof for my claims, and I don't care if you don't like what you're reading. Eating disorders are incredibly deadly for young women. That's the truth. Minimizing that fact doesn't solve ANYTHING. I'm not a obesity apologist and I think HAES is bullshit. But the fact it, the mortality rates are incredibly high. Something like 40% of people with anorexia die after 15 years. It's horrible. I almost died from it."

Two weeks later I was at his house and he called me his girlfriend.  I was very excited and we had a very fun weekend.  Problem is, I came home and checked OKC and there he was still.  Plus I googled his user name and found he was on another site too!  Oops!

I called him that night and said that I love being his girlfriend but I'm not his girlfriend until he gets off of the dating sites, so that's his choice.  And if he's not ready, that's cool, but I'm not his girlfriend until that's done.

He asked me to please not make it into a bigger deal than it was, and that for the most part it was just an old habit after being on there for 4 years, and the messages amuse him.  That's fine I guess, but still, I won't be your girlfriend until you're off.  He got on his computer and I sat on the phone with him while he deleted everything.

People were not jerks about it, most of the time the dibs were claimed on spots right in front of each person's house. 

Is dibs a silly tradition? Yes, totally. But it was reasonable under those circumstances. Now, if people try to claim dibs in a heavily populated area where there is more multi-unit housing dibs seems really kinda stupid. Just because you dig out a spot for yourself, doesn't mean that for the 12 hours your car is out of that spot while you're at work that spot is still ""yours."" My neighborhood is full of multi-unit housing and I don't see anyone who claims dibs. I would laugh if they tried, but thankfully I think most people around here get it. If you go more north where there is more single family houses, yeah, dibs everywhere again. I think most people intuitively know when dibs is appropriate and when it is just asshole behavior. "

Portugal. The Man. Im a big fan personally - try *In the Mountain in the Cloud* and *Evil Friends*. 

On An On comes to mind, and I think their album *Give In* was one of the best of the year.

Also try Ted Leo &amp; The Pharmacists, especially their earlier albums like *Shake The Sheets* and *The Tyranny of Distance*.

Also Spoon and Modest Mouse!! Two awesome bands. 

I think you would also like Local Natives, The National, Guards, Ra Ra Riot (often compared to Vampire Weekend), Pacific Air (great new album!), Shields, Grizzly Bear, The Zolas, Mansions on the Moon, Yukon Blonde, Electric Guest, Broken Social Scene, Two Door Cinema Club, The New Pornographers, The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Andrew Bird, TV on the Radio, White Arrows, Cut Copy, Tokyo Police Club.

It's part of the accommodation process of taking classes here (when in university courses or at a job here, you *will* work with the opposite sex).

soccerdadak,Dualsport,1389308960.0,"I second [ProCycle](http://www.procycle.us/bikepages/dr650.html).  They've got a good range of products for the DR.  I went through a few different vendors to get the kit I put on my bike (and am still putting on).  [TPI](http://www.tpimotorcycleparts.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=30&amp;Itemid=53&amp;TreeId=21) is also a good place to go.

I can't recommend tires as I'm moving to more street focus than dirt ([Shinko 705](http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/shinko-705-dual-sport-tires))

I put [Wolfman Expedition Dry Bags](http://www.wolfmanluggage.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_id=96) on my bike.  I like them.  Easy to use, easy to carry, though a bit fiddly to put on.  I've put the bike down, twice, with no issues to the bags, though I know they won't hold up to anything serious.  Nothing's ever gotten wet, and I've ridden in some absolute downpours.  They were less than half the cost of hard case systems I was looking at.

I added the [fuel canister holders](http://www.wolfmanluggage.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;product_id=254) for the Primus fuel bottles.

I put an Acerbis 5.3 gallon tank on as well (like [this](http://justgastanks.com/product_info.php?products_id=2716) one, but I got mine from ProCycle)

I got LED turn signals (generic, I think $25 a pair), as well as the HID headlight from ProCycle (highly recommend.  Plug and play and makes a huge difference in visibility).  The LED turn signals are a bit of work as they require a diod kit, but even that was straightforward.

I ditched the stock handguards for a pair of [Barkbusters](http://www.twistedthrottle.com/barkbusters-vps-handguard-for-7-8-handlebars) (saved my hands in a head-on wreck with a car)

I also picked up a large rear rack from [these guys](http://www.moto-racks.com/DR650-buy-page.html)

Until I get the new seat (and probably after), I've added a sheepskin buttpad (I bought [this one](http://www.alaskaleatheronline.com/servlet/the-16/Sheepskin-Motorcycle-Seat-Cover%2C/Detail)).  Made a big difference on that less-than-luxurious stock seat.

Finally, I picked up a [Kolpin Fuel Pack Jr](http://www.amazon.com/Kolpin-89185-Fuel-Pack-Compliant/dp/B00384CCBA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389308232&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=Kolpin+Fuel+Pack+Junior+with+Pack+Mount) to be mounted flat across the rear rack.

Also, not totally bike related, but I recommend a bluetooth headset/communicator.  Play music, answer phone, etc.  Makes those very long rides that much more tolerable.  I got the [Sena](http://www.amazon.com/Sena-SMH10-10-Motorcycle-Bluetooth-Intercom/dp/B0087NAWYQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389308629&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sena+smh10) and have liked it well enough (good battery life, ok audio quality, easy to use, easy to mount).

**Next on the list (to be ordered this month):**

New seat from [Seat Concepts](http://www.seatconcepts.com/products#!/~/product/category=1671358&amp;id=7268100) (half the price of Corbin and others, but great reviews and testimonials on ADVRider)

[DG O-Series slip-on exhaust](http://www.amazon.com/DG-Performance-03-6500-O-Series-1997-2012/dp/B0031BL3BA)

[MondoMotos Bullet LEDs](http://mondomotos.com/lighting/led/MM10) (more visibility)


Here's [my bike](http://imgur.com/a/5xxyU) without the rear rack (it arrived while I was at the shop installing everything else...go figure).

So after already being on a binge for a few days, we smoked some bulbies of his shit. Later my friend &amp; her bf and my roommate went out for drinks and I was to meet up later so I could take a shower or something first.  The details are pretty fuzzy, but I do remember panicking because I couldn't find my glasses.  I spent a long time in the bathroom looking for them in full blown tweaker mode.  My friends ended up calling me, wondering where I was at.  I explained to them in a panic about not being able to see because I couldn't find my glasses.  One of them, bless their heart, came back down to the house to help me find them in a very obvious spot.  It was such a 'duh' moment but I was really fucking high. So we all just laughed it off.

I've also snorted meth off a bathroom counter at a local pub on multiple occasions.  Looking back that wasn't very hygienic at all.

Another bathroom story was being high on mushrooms when I still lived at home and my parents were out of town.  Their bathroom is narrow, like a hallway and one wall is a very large mirror, which takes up most of the wall.  On the adjacent wall hung a much smaller mirror. It was like looking into infinity and I spent a good amount of my trip in the bathroom because of it."

Did you generally date older men, or was it a surprise to you when you fell for him?

How did family take it?

How much does it piss you off when strangers take you for his daughter? (Though I suppose that maybe he could look great for his age.)

Did he have any initial hang-ups?"

blackpony04,AdviceAnimals,1389309239.0,You have obviously never owned a Siberian Husky. Mine would actually grin at me and run faster because it was a game to him. And that fucker could really run too. We learned to just aim him towards a safe area and he'd eventually get trapped in someones backyard. I honestly don't think he would ever come home on his own.

No. That's just false. I mean, seriously dude. That's just not the way the world works. It may be that way in a lot of cases, but I can point to just as many examples of honest marketing that don't rely on lying. 

&gt; I think you're trying just a bit too hard to condemn Alienware. 

No, it's just that as someone who's had a CrossfireX setup and been crippled by the single side of RAM, I find the blatant misrepresentation to be particularly offensive, especially when hundreds of dollars are at stake based on that claim. It's not like an advertisement for McDonalds or a cheap oil change with conditions; some people will see 6GB of VRAM and 4GB of VRAM and will undoubtedly decide that the extra 33% of VRAM is valuable, despite not being able to use it, and those people will be paying hundred of dollars for that ""privilege"".

pizzaandburritos,dating,1389309276.0,"Maybe means no 90% of the time. She was probably just trying to be polite, given that she was in the uncomfortable position of cutting your hair. Now, if she contacts you, great. But if she doesn't contact you after a week, then find a new barber. If you choose to have her cut your hair again, the least awkward thing for both of you is to say, ""hey, I'm sorry about putting you on the spot last time. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."" And leave it at that. Don't ask again. The way you handle the situation says a lot about you. If a guy is able to diffuse awkwardness, I count him as a gentleman and I would actually rethink my initial rejection of him. On the other hand, a persistent guy or a guy who decides to pretend I no longer exist is a big turn off for me."
