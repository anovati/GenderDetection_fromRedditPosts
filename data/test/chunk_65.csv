FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390410719.0,"Is it a lot, most, or just the people that show up as compatible for you?  Maybe it's not as common as you think, it just stands out more because it's super odd to you, or maybe seeing 30 profiles like that seems crazy, when there are actually hundreds or thousands in your area.  It's like going to a bar, meeting 5 guys, 4 of which are lame, so therefore, a lot of guys are lame.  But really, you only met 5 guys, and maybe the other 20 were really cool.  

Also, I set up a profile for a friend and got to see all the messages sent/profiles/etc. - while stuff like this definitely happened, I wouldn't say it was necessarily in excess.  Some people don't know how to handle dating, and even less so for online dating.  Actually, most people I've met have no idea how to properly utilize/optimize online dating.

&gt;wouldn't you want to be perceived as above average and super cool?

Yes, but most people don't know how to talk about themselves without sounding like they're either putting themselves down or bragging. I think they try to balance things out, and in the process, go for middle of the road.  Either that or ""yeah, I'm just your average guy, really down to earth.""  Contrast this with women that are fun and like to have a good time.  Yeah, no shit.

&gt;Some tell really weird, not funny or offensive jokes in the first messages. 

People are *stupid*.  Trust me, girls do this, too - maybe not so much on offensive jokes, but I've gotten some pretty terrible messages.  Either they're legitimately trying to be funny, or they're seeing if your senses of humor align.  It kind of makes sense - if that's the person they are and you don't like it, then better to get that out of the way (I personally wouldn't do it, but I understand the reasoning).

&gt;A lot of the pictures I see make no sense to me at all. 

The absolute best method for pictures is 1 head shot, 1 body shot, and 1 action shot.  Additional pictures are fine but unnecessary.  Most people don't realize this.  Hell, when I was helping my friend make a profile, she and my girlfriend were trying to pick out her pictures, and I turned down just about every single one and picked out the ones that would be best.  The thing is, guys know what guys like and girls know what girls like.  If you want the right pictures and you're a guy, it's better to have a girl pick them out.  Most guys have no clue what types of pictures actually appeal to women, so they go based on their best judgment, which might not be that great.

And to add, I met my girlfriend on an online dating site a year and a half ago.  I almost didn't message her because I didn't like her pictures, to be honest.  Then I met her in person...damn.  HUGE difference.  She looked just okay in her pictures but fantastic in person (and she wasn't too into our first meetup because she was getting sick of the whole online dating thing, so she wasn't even trying).  It's funny how different men and women see things.  Like I said, I picked the pictures for our friend - they weren't the first picks to them, but she had 100+ page views in a couple hours and probably 40+ messages.  Hell, she had maybe 10 messages when all we had up were the pictures.  So bit of advice - if you want people to look at your profile, have a (tasteful) guy pick them out.

&gt;Why do guys think posting pictures of their car ... is something that will interest most women?

Refer to the last point for this one.  Also, funnily enough, the friend I was creating the profile for is obsessed with cars.  She was *very* interested in the cars/bikes that people had in their pictures, although she would ignore them if she didn't like the car/bike.  I don't get the car thing either, though.

&gt;Are they trying to look cool and prove they are desirable to women or invoke some sense of jealousy in me?

Women do this, too.  I don't get it.  I did it once because it was with some of my family, but I noted that in the picture - it was a great picture with my sister and my cousins, and we were all having a good time, probably the most fun picture of me that I had, so why not?  Plus, it shows that I have a blast with my family, which I'm sure a lot of people would be happy to see.  But yeah, just some random woman and no explanation?  That guy's an idiot.  Every time we saw that happen when looking through profiles, we'd all shout, ""Next!""

Also, paraphrasing a quote, but imagine how stupid the average person is (in this case, average guy), and then realize that half the population is dumber than that.  That should give you an idea of what you're dealing with."

unicornbomb,bettafish,1390410738.0,"First things first, grab a heater. The 25watt hydor theo is a good compact size model with adjustable temperature settings. Adjustable is good, since preset models are rarely accurate and the actual tank temperature can vary widely depending on the temperatures outside the tank. With the cold snap we've been having, my heaters are set a good 8 degrees higher than normal to compensate and keep the tanks at a steady 78 degrees. 

As far as the filter -- what type of media is in it? Ideally, you don't want to replace filter media ever, short of it falling apart. Beneficial bacteria that keeps your water quality good and the tank properly cycled lives in that media, so replacing the media means tossing all that good stuff. 

Carbon filter media is largely useless in spite of most filters coming with it -- studies have shown that the carbon itself is really only effective for about a week, and even then its really only useful as a temporary measure for removing medication from your tank. 

Better options for filter media: plain ol' filter sponge and biological media like biomax or seachem matrix. I also like Seachem purigen for keeping water crystal clear and nitrates in check. Personally, I use all three stacked on top of each other in my filters -- a filter sponge, followed by purigen, followed by a small bag of biomax. 

I never replace any -- the sponge gets squeezed out and rinsed in old tank water once a week, along with the biomax. You 'recharge' purigen when the media turns dark every 6 months or so by soaking it in diluted bleach, followed by dechlorinator for 24 hours before returning it to the tank. 

As far as plants go -- I'm a huge fan of live plants. Well planted aquariums require fewer water changes, have a more stable cycle, and the water quality is better. Plants readily eat up excess nitrates and nutrients that would otherwise encourage algae growth, whereas in a non-planted aquarium, the only way to get rid of them even slightly is to do a water change. There are a few plants that dont require planting in the substrate like java fern and anubias, that you can just tie to decor with a piece of cotton thread if cleaning is a concern. "

But first, if a number is divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. In other words it must be an even number, that also has 3, or at least a number divisible by 3, as a factor.

So, n³ - n = (n - 1)(n)(n + 1).

* In any set of three consecutive integers, at least one them must be even. Any product having at least one even factor must be even; **therefore n³ - n must be even.**
* And in any set of three consecutive integers, exactly one of them must be 3, or a multiple 3. Any product having 3 or a multiple of 3 as a factor is divisible by 3; **therefore n³ - n is divisible by 3.**

Still i just stayed clear in my desicion and of course i had fear, but when you love something you just work it out, and the universe somehow makes it possible too.

She's not the worst person in the world. That unlived life of craziness and exploration is a bit of an illusion and she got suckered into it. The people who feel the need to sow their oats are generally unsettled, unsatisfied, unsure of what they want, afraid of making long term decisions, not really secure in their identity, etc., and those things are not good for maintaining a relationship.

She fucked up bad, but the silver lining is that you deserve someone who is better, more sure, more faithful, and now you get to go find that person."

I agree that it can be discomforting, but I feel like there might be some deeper seated issues if a message from an anonymous stranger makes you very upset. And perhaps in most instances it doesn't, but it seems that the focus of the OP's argument is women that have intense reactions to it."

beefcakez,naturalbodybuilding,1390411108.0,"&gt;Several years ago, after chatting with Arthur and reading some of his thinking on the topic, I began charting other lifters' reps at 80 percent max. I found that guys who were so-called ""fast"" gainers were only able to do 4-6 reps at 80 percent, while lifters who seemingly never made great gains were able to rep out at around 15-20 reps with 80 percent of their max. Apparently, so-called ""fast gainers"" have rather poor anaerobic strength endurance.

His charting documented 'fast gainers' as such, so maybe you could reverse this and see by testing your rep-endurance at 80% of your 1 rep max. If you could only do 4-6 or so, then you could generally classify yourself as a fast gainer. 

Keep in mind that this is speculation. The 4-6 reps are generally evidence of a higher percentage of type II fibers, which grow much faster than Type I fibers (hypertrophy wise).

Heck, why don't you freeze sperm and get a vasectomy? Or submerge your testicles in hot water daily? Or volunteer for a clinical trial of a male contraceptive? You do have options - why aren't you taking them?"

Ugye alap dolog, a függőség a dopamin miatt alakul ki, stb., mindenki vágja már ezt a részét a dolognak. Na most mi történik, ha megvonod magadtól a dopamin termelést? Az agyad ugyanúgy sóvárogni fog utána, és nem fogja tudni máshonnan pótolni, tehát előbb-utóbb a cravingek egyre erősebbek lesznek, és nem fognak csillapodni. A megoldás az, hogy keresel olyan módszereket, amivel ismét tudsz dopamint termelni, és azzal az agyad ellesz egy ideig megint.

Hogy hogyan lehet alternatív módon dopamint termelni? Jó a kérdés, a válasz pedig nem annyira egyértelmű. Mindenkinek meg kell találnia azt a dolgot, ami képes az agyában dopamint termelni. Sokaknak ezek extrém sportok lehetnek (ejtőernyő pl.), másoknak lehet, hogy a zene. Nálam ez utóbbi bizonyul nyertesnek (illetve biztos az ejtőernyőzés is megtenné, de hát nincs rá pénzem).

Nem olyan régóta elérhető nálunk is a [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/), és ami nagyon jó, hogy gyakorlatilag korlátlan mennyiségű zene van benne, mindenféle stílusban. A függőséggel jár, hogy az agyad változatosságot is ""követel"", különben nem termelődik annyi dopamin. Tehát a megoldásom az, hogy minden nap hallgatok ÚJ zenéket, és ezzel csillapítom a dopamin iránti éhségem. Eddig működik.

Pár éve volt egy szám, amit először meghallgatva szinte orgazmusom volt, képes volt annyi dopamin terelődni a szám meghallgatására, mintha kivertem volna."

shadow1515,askscience,1390411208.0,"I listened to a Radiolab podcast the other day about using rings in coral, clams, and other shelled animals to show how days used to be shorter on Earth millions of years ago and thus track the gradual tidal locking of the Earth and Moon.

My question that they never really explained was: What is the mechanism of the formation of these rings and why does it apparently rely on daylight instead of climate, when the large annual ring *is* based on climate?

Background for those who don't want to find/listen to the podcast: they can see a bunch of tiny rings in coral, and then a large ring about every 360 or so. So, one ring is produced each day and then a large ring during some growth spurt in the summer (which apparently only lasts a few days? they didn't really explain that in detail either). If you look at coral that are millions of years old, you start seeing more small rings between the large ones. According to the biologists interviewed on the podcast, this is a good way to show how there used to be more days in a year. The daily rings are still made with each day/night cycle, but for some reason the large ring always came just once per revolution around the Sun."

Honestly, you shouldn't.  Would you turn down an otherwise great girl that was super unattractive to you?  That's not unreasonable - just because she can't control it, doesn't mean you *have* to make it okay for you.

I'm the same way.  Sex can be more spontaneous and happen anywhere and anytime without condoms.  It also actually feels good, while condoms take the sensation away.  Also, condoms feel tight, and that's uncomfortable and not something I want during sex.  I've been with girls in the past that couldn't go on birth control, and I understand 100%.  But now that I'm with someone who is, I just can't go back.  I'd lose so much about what makes sex so great to me.  I mean, does someone really want to be with me if I'm just going to see our sex life as ""lacking""?  I don't think so.  That's not fair to either of us.

Serae,AskWomen,1390411364.0,"I hope I can be of some help.  I am not mean to people but I always find myself feeling outside of other people.  No one dislikes me but I feel like I am easily forgettable from time to time.  I am miserable with relating to people who aren't similar to me and often ended up on my own when I should be with larger groups.

It took me years to learn to connect with people in simple ways and become part of a group.  If asking co-workers, friends or acquaintances about me they would say I am friendly and nice.

I find that people like to talk about themselves.  Even I do.  Asking questions makes me come across as friendly.  I know the difference between being nosey and just continuing a conversation...although I don't know how to explain it.  Let's say a friend is talking about their boyfriend who may or may not be an utter ass.  Maybe you would normally tear down her choices by invalidating her feelings, dissing the boyfriend, telling her that what she should be doing instead...  Let's change the focus.  Ask her how she is feeling.  Ask her how she wishes things would change.  Ask her what is making her happy.  If she's not then ask her if being happy is worth making some changes.  Ask the questions but leave the dialogue up to them.  In time you come across as more caring and invested in the other person.

A big thing to think about is: how is this thing about this person that I would usually insult really effect me at all?  I think you might find that you may be complaining or addressing things that have nothing to do with you.  Maybe you go to a friend's house and it's really messy.  But the two of you are going out for fun.  Is it necessary to comment on a place you won't be hanging out?  Or simply: it's there home, not yours, why does it matter?

If you feel like you are doing these ""digs"" in order to feel better about yourself then your energy is being wasted.  My mother does this and never got over it.  If your identity in the eyes of other is important to you, then you need to take actions to change it.  People sense your disappointment in yourself.  Don't give them that bad energy.  Find things about yourself you are proud of and make that a focus (but don't brag).

Recognizing this and wanting to have better relationships is great.  I wish you the best!

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390411367.0,"&gt; That wouldn't happen if you fed the poor like churches do.

Churches only do so much.

No, we're looking at history, as well as unregulated economies around the world.

&gt;At the expense of millions of other people. What you are is selfish, by forcing others to do your biding. Churches dont force everyone. Why do you?

Because it doesn't get done otherwise. Also, the millions who pay the most would actually be the best off anyway, so the loss will be small compared to the poor person''s benefit.

&gt;Actually, many Liberals do want to take the rich down a notch.

Only because they're perpetuating poverty and exploitation among others.

&gt;The Constitution and Declaration of Independence did that from the start. We just had to go to war with the Democrats to make it happen.

You do realize that modern democrats aren't the democrats of back then? Haven't been since Nixon's southern strategy.

Also, the constitution and declaration only gave equality to rich, property owning white males.

Buscat,Fitness,1390411380.0,"Definitely some weirdness going on with your arms/back angle/bar positioning. You seem to have the bar positioning of a low bar squat, but the back angle of a high bar, which is causing you to have to use your arms to keep it from sliding downwards. You also must be arching your spine a lot to have your head/neck/shoulders/chest so vertical relative to the ground, but it's kind of hard to tell from that angle.

http://i.imgur.com/K8DJxVm.png

high bar is middle, low bar is right. When you have the back angle and bar positioning right, you should be able to rest your hands on the bar without them supporting any weight. I put my thumbs overtop the bar, to make sure I'm not using my hands to push it up at all."

soitcause,changemyview,1390411577.0,"&gt;It's not the lack of style that impressed me but rather the violence, resentment and contempt that I received as a woman. Harrassment in the form ""hey darling, what ya wearin'"" is annoying but not offensive.

A lot of people have violent, abusive and frankly misogynistic fantasies. I think it has less to do with being a woman than being a woman *on the internet*. There are no consequences for belittling people like that, so there is no filter. 

&gt;I can't speak on behalf of women, but sincerely neither can a woman. 

Well yeah, I wasn't asking for someone to speak as the representative of all women, more so just wanting to know what one's expectations are going into these situations.

&gt;I think any human being deserves some inherent respect and definitely not the type of violence I witnessed that as a man I have not. Sure I have had a ""gimme your address and I'll kick the shit out of you"" or ""I hope you die""...but very rarely and usually in very childish form.

Have you ever played an online game with any kind of chat function? This kind of behavior is not solely limited to women on dating sites.

I think we agree.

My guess is they'll replace him and probably look to shake things up in other ways, too.

That's exactly the question that *I'm* asking. The words and phrases are already archaic; if you give them a study guide to the meaning, how long will it be before they start substituting the modern usage for those spots on which they get stuck?

For an analogy, some GLs have a shortened form of some of the ceremonies. Conn used to have a shortened opening, which was supposed be be used only on nights where you had non-Masons waiting (for a presentation, etc.). It saved only 3 minutes (I've timed it), but many lodges started using it anyway for all meetings. And then it morphed into a short closing. And then yo had several years of Masons who had never/rarely heard anything differently, so instead of following the monitor, they followed what was familiar. Next thing you know, we've got 10+ years of lodge using ""short form"" opening and closing. "

MZago1,powerrangers,1390411675.0,"Much like u/oracle712 said. Nothing big will happen. I like to think that maybe Samurai, Super Samurai, and Mega Force suffered from low budget in anticipation of Super Mega Force. That Sabah new an anniversary was coming and wanted to invest much more and create a great season. Sadly I don't think that will be the case. This season will be heavily dependent upon new footage but they're going to be lazy and recycle Sentai footage. I have low expectations for the Mega War. We'll see a few people helmetless briefly, but it's going to end up being very brief shots accompanied by grunts and groans that do nothing to follow up on our favorite characters or explain them to younger fans who haven't seen those seasons. The war will end with the Rangers winning at no loss. All their powers will be retained and nothing significant will occur.

For what it's worth, I hope I'm wrong. I want them to shock me, but I doubt they will. In a perfect world, maybe the create a wormhole from the SPD rangers coming from the future, the RPM rangers from their alternate universe, or from the fact that we don't know how the first 6 seasons will be represented with all the power transfers. This worm hole would allow Lord Zedd to come back from the past and challenge a new team.

tamasuperstar,reddevils,1390411823.0,"I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure they're actually very different players.

Obviously the ideal would be both but that would never happen.

Gundogan is more of a playmaker, who can contribute defensively and also bomb forward. From what I've seen he seems to be the second coming of Carrick, but with more potential and far far more mobility.


Vidal on the other hand is less of a playmaker and more a absolutely complete box to box midfielder. When people talk about replacing Roy Keane, I see Vidal as the absolute ideal for this. While Gundogan reminds me of a better Carrick, Vidal reminds me far more of the second coming of Roy Keane, even coming with a bit of the insanity and ego.



I could be completely speaking out of my ass, but this is my understanding of the two.

Gundogan - Much more a specialised Playmaker.

Vidal - Much more of a Roy Keane moulded box to box.


Who do we need - Both, but failing that I'm really undecided. I'm inclined to say Vidal, and that's coming from someone who considers Gundogan one of his favourite footballers about at the moment. But Vidal seems to be a fucking sensation and a one of a kind that we'd be mad to not try to get. Plus Playmakers like Gundogan tend to be more common than such a complete player like Vidal. Gundogans nerve damage worries me too.

TL;DR: Heart says Gundogan, Head says Vidal."

Kelmurdoch,askscience,1390411858.0,"[lapsed masters in virology answer]

First, cancer and a viral infection are not the same thing, and I'll leave that argument to some other question.

Virus's only objective is to replicate successfully, they do not do so consciously or anything like that.  That they may or may not kill their host is only seen on a evolutionary scale; individual viral particles do not care, they only replicate.

Many viruses 'live' in a parasitical relationship with their host, never killing, and often only impacting their host minimally.  An example are Herpes viruses, HSV1 and HSV2.  Human Papilloma is another example.  They are highly specialized to infect their host such that the entire viral load is able to replicate but not so quickly or destructively so as to negatively affect their host, for then the host would not be a good site for viral replication anymore.  Most eukaryotic viruses throughout the natural follow this pattern, so in that sense to answer your question, most viruses do not aim to kill their host, they 'aim', as a whole, to replicate most efficiently, and they do so by keeping their host alive while replicating.

HIV and things like Ebola kill their host mostly because they are newly introduced to their host species, often coming from another closely related species, like any of the apes.  Their replication machinery is not tuned to cause little harm to the host, rather it overloads the host system and causes the host to die or be negatively affected.

HIV and Ebola are thus 'bad' viruses, in the sense that they decrease their own ability to replicate by reducing their opportunities to replicate.  I wold wager than given enough generations HIV and Ebola would both become relatively benign infections that do not kill humans, which would maximize their ability to replicate."
Not2original,bicycling,1390411866.0,"Definition of terms:

* Single speed- a bike with one gear, and either a coaster break, (trying to back pedal applies the break) or rim breaks. (levers on the handlebars and attach via cable to rubber stoppers on the front and rear tire rims. If the bike has this type of breaking the rider and pedal backwards with no effect (free wheeling). This is mainly used to make sure the pedals are in the proper position for starting off from a stop and cornering.

* Fixie: A single speed bike that usually must have rim/disc breaks (depending on state law) because the pedals are directly tied to the speed/rotation of the rear tire.  **The rider will be unable to coast on a fixie bike**  Like when you were a kid riding a big wheel, pedal real fast then take your feet of the pedals as you speed down the hill.  (this is why rim/disc breaks are required in some states)  

More advanced riders, can/do/and will clip in to the pedals and can apply opposite directional force to slow the speed of the rear wheel, or force a skid of the rear tire in order to slow down/stop.

Hope this provides some insight and knowledge for you."

mandym347,Sherlock,1390412417.0,"They already skipped over the canon's way of getting Watson married, and that was actually described in the Sign of Four, unlike her sudden and mysterious death in between stories.

In fact, if they were going strictly by canon, Mary would have been introduced in series 2 and casually mentioned as dead at the beginning of 3 when Sherlock comes back.  lol  I actually liked her in the first episode that I saw, but I think I value sticking to canon more.

If I remember correctly, and someone with a better memory for the stories can certainly correct me, Watson in the stories at some point sells his practice and was surprised by the sum he received for it, and only years later finds out that it was Holmes who had put a cousin up to it and provided funds, all to get Watson back at Baker St after the death of a wife (the exact number of Watson's wives were never really defined).

myimportantthoughts,poker,1390412429.0,"&gt; How can I determine mathematically if that's an acceptable range?

What do you mean? 

This would depend a lot on the stake, reads, tourney /cash, stack depth etc.

I don't think it is possible to work out the perfect answer here, I don't think any poker player or computer program in existence would be able to say: this is the correct flop x/r range. All I think we can do is make some assumptions and come up with a few ideas for having a somewhat balanced range.

Are you looking for a chart like this:

Lets say we have 4 sorts of hands, top pair+, fdraws, oesds, and air that is just a high card ( including gutters)

Bet on the flop: 80% of top pair+ hands, 50% of flush draws, 25% osed straight draws, 20% of air

Check fold on flop: 70% of air (no pair or draw) 25% oesds

Check call on flop: 10% of top pair+ hands 25% flush draws, 25% oesds

Check raise on flop:10% of top pair+ hands, 25% flush draws, 25% oesd, 10% of air.

This is a very very rough guess on my part, don't start using this in every SB/BB encounter.

I cannot imagine how complex this would be to create if we want to be 'mathematically acceptable'. If everyone on /r/poker created their own version they would all be different, and no doubt CC0 will explain that my version is terribly unbalanced.

The only certainty that I think that I can come up with is that for every path where you are continuing with the hand you should have some value hands and some bluffs. I also think that when we have a strong hand, we generally want to be betting, as this is the best way to put chips in the pot and get value. "

ibbity,rant,1390412465.0,"Are you bitching about SAHM moms who are MARRIED, or single mothers who stay home and live off of benefits? These are not the same thing and should not be treated as such; the former may not be out in the world earning her keep but she isn't costing society anything, either. The latter is. 

The married SAHMs that I know stay home because the cost of full-time childcare would be more money than they could make taking a job (look into it some time, childcare is fucking BRUTAL on the bank account), or because they homeschool, which is not exactly the same as sitting on their asses all day whining about how harrrd their life is while doing nothing. These women tend to have a lot of children, too, and if you think that dealing with 5-8 kids under 12 years old 24/7 + being in charge of educating them is easy, then you have another think coming. That shit is cray.

On the other hand there are a subset of SAHMs who have what I like to call ""Superior Stay At Home Mom Syndrome"" where they think that they are morally superior to working mothers because they stay home, and that kind does nothing but yammer about their boring children and passive-aggressively snark at mothers who have jobs as being inferior parents, and this kind drives me up the fucking wall.

When her solution is as simple as swallowing a pill every morning, with no loss of pleasure and no side effects, then yes, swallow that pill. If she has side effects,  then as I said, its too bad for her, she just wont be in a relationship with me, I honestly do not see the problem.

We all have requirements for a partner, they all differ. You might want someone who is tall, handsome and funny. I want someone who is tall, funny and on the pill. 

Well, I have NEVER had to think about other solutions, as Ive never in my life been in a relationship with someone, who made a big deal out it. I didnt even know it was a big deal, until I came on reddit. As I said, Ive met one single girl in my life, who had side effects.

As for why Im not taking the options, its pretty simple, theres no need. If I ever fall madly in love head over heels, with someone who wont take bithcontrol, I might look into differnet things. I know myself well enough tho, that it will annoy me to no end and take away from my pleasure. Having to suddenly think of all these restrictions under sex, instead of just having fun with it, just seems tedious, I cant even imagine. Having to track cycles and pulling out, shit. 

So long story short is really, I dont care if you want to take birthcontrol or not, its your choice and I respect that. Just dont expect me to be around for it. There are plenty of guys out there who will accept it and appreciate getting sex, it wont be me.

Airazz,cars,1390412797.0,"Smugglers are still popular in my part of Europe. 

When choosing a car, they make sure that it's both reliable and cheap. Reliable car is necessary to run away via unpaved forest roads and shit. Low price is good if something happens and they need to abandon the car. CTS-V Wagon from that other comment would be nice and fast, but it would also be too expensive to be worth the risk. It would also suck monkey balls on a dirt road.

Next is weight: remove everything that's not necessary: seats, spare tire, all trimming and shit. More space for your goods. Of course, the suspension is toughened up too, the engine is beefed up a little.

One neat trick they have is adding engine coolant to the windscreen washing fluid reservoir, then running its tubing to the fuel intake. Move the windscreen washer lever, coolant gets into the engine and you get a very very thick cloud of white smoke from the exhaust. Used just before a sharp turn, helps lose those who are chasing you.

Here the most popular cars are Subaru. Reliable, can be found for a low price, four wheel drive. Outback's for the richer smugglers, Legacy wagons for the beginners. Audi 100 Avant are also common. Most are 4WD, as smuggling something via the main roads would be silly.

She was by far the best pull for me in my life so far, an 8 on bad days, curvy where it mattered, ridiculously blue eyes, etc. We had copious amounts of casual (and great) sex over the space of about 6 months, then when we got really close, she kinda distanced herself from me and communication broke down for a while.

Then, at the start of last summer, we start talking again and before you know it, back to our old ways, and yet again, we got really close, and then (yet again), when it looked like we'd eventually start going out properly, communication breaks down yadda yadda yadda.

I can only imagine that when this current relationship breaks down (and knowing my track record, it will), we'll end up hooking up again.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1390412869.0,"&gt; And can you please elaborate on how feminism has obtained such power to keep men from expressing their masculinity unless it has their stamp of approval?

It's nothing so severe, IMO, but there is a trend not entirely related to feminism. From what I've read and worked with, it has more to do with spending and voting habits. Women spend more in general for numerous reasons. They're also more more financially stable. Men are less predictable (""overconfident""), take more risks, save more, and tend to spend more on irregular purchases when we do spend. We're not the best consumer base to pander to.

Women are also more politically partisan. It's not just that they vote Democrat more than men, but that they do so more strikingly than men do so for Republican. 

A lot of these general patterns makes women more frequent targets of pandering by politicians/parties and corporations alike. I see this not only anecdotally but as someone who has worked with big data from commerce.

It doesn't bother me significantly on a personal level, since I'm not that conservative (I argue with libertarians all the time) and I already dislike mainstream media. There are factors pushing towards feminine biases/preferences in our society, but I see it mostly as a result of accidental, not deliberate conspiracy."

There's your problem right there.

It is not ""stirring it up"" - it's law - you're legally protected to be safe in the workplace, and your company is required to do something about it.

I had a coworker become extra touchy-feely when I broke up with an ex - he would come up behind me and give me back rubs or touch my back and ask how I was doing, and I was mortified.  I told my manager, who told me she had gotten complaints from other women, and she told me to record the time he did it again and she'd see it on video (security cameras).

monster_woman,offmychest,1390412978.0,"You can learn to talk yourself down. It will take years of practice, but you can do it. First you need to be in a calm place that you feel is safe. What I do when I panic or get paranoid is first take deep breaths and regulate my breathing. Talk to yourself out loud and tell yourself something positive, like it will be okay. Or nothing's wrong. Whatever makes you feel okay.

Then you have to remember the truth is usually a place in between the worst and the best. So, let's say I think someone is lying to me. But I know that can't be, because the person is a friend, and they wouldn't lie. I tell myself the real evidence I have for that thing, like, okay, I know he told me the truth, because I saw X, or I talked to Y, and she told me the same thing. And I focus on that truth, on what I really know is real. And I will also tell myself how, even if he did lie, it isn't that bad, but you know he didn't lie, because of whatever evidence I have. It's hard when people have done bad things in the past to work through that and believe that not everyone will lie, but it's true. People are not the same and just because one person lied, doesn't mean everyone will lie about everything. Then after I calm down, I'll take a nap or drink some tea or do something relaxing.

Just keep being kind to yourself and you can help yourself to feel better. But you have to be a friend to yourself and treat yourself like you would treat a friend. I hope things get better for you."

vyvantage,AskReddit,1390413150.0,"I've been interested in programming since I was in about 5th grade or so, and when I was 14, I got a job working register at a local CVS.

The register wasn't one of those new networked register machines, it was just an old PC running a 'register' program connected to a cashbox.

Out of all the employees, I was the most computer savvy, so whenever an issue would pop up (blue screen of death, updates needed, etc), the managers would just give me their log-in and have me deal with it. It became a convenient excuse to be 'fixing a computer problem' all day while I was really just dicking around running out the clock until closing time.

During one of these all-day computer dickings, I stumbled onto the interface used to set up and plug-in promotional scripts into the register program (round up a few cents for cancer, special 2-for-1 deals, etc).

**Long story short, I wrote my own register script for a cash-only donation-type promotion, asked customers if they would like to give to charity, pocketed the difference, and bought myself a new car in time for getting my Learners Permit—all at age 14 while working minimum wage as a CVS cashier. I quit soon after with a few grand in the bank.**

mhblm,explainlikeimfive,1390413157.0,"I'm not exactly sure if this falls under the same paradigm, because I haven't read up on it as much as I have traffic stops. But generally, the police are allowed to make seizures of money if they have evidence that the money was associated with illegal drug activity, even if they do not have enough evidence to charge the person with a crime.

What amount of evidence they need to seize cash is unclear, and is a subject of ongoing debate. It has also been noted that this kind of seizure opens the door to a lot of police corruption if the standard of evidence is too low, since police departments get to keep some or most of the cash. There was a notable case decided about six months ago in which a couple who was carrying about a million dollars in cash was pulled over in Nebraska. The couple later claimed to be transporting the cash for a friend who had saved it over a period of many years in safe deposit boxes, and who was investing. They consented to a search of their car (again, **never do this**) and the cash was found. The police arrested the couple for suspected drug activity, though no drug paraphernalia was found in the car. (It should be noted that the police could have simply arrested them for the traffic violation and searched the car at the station.) At the station, the money was hidden and a drug dog correctly identified the location of the money, giving the police evidence that the money may have been transported with drugs, and allowing them to seize the cash. The couple was then released, as there was not enough evidence to bring the case to criminal trial.

A federal judge later decided (rightly, in my opinion) that the dog search was not evidence that the money was linked to the drug trade, since it is known that some unknown percentage of all money is tainted with drugs. The judge then concluded that the transportation of large amounts of cash, while suspicious, does not give enough evidence of drug trafficking for the police to seize property. 

If the police had had a positive dog sniff before searching, they likely would have been able to seize the cash.

In short, the DEA would likely be able to seize large amounts of money following a major drug bust, as this money was suspicious and Mike Ehrmantraut was employed by a drug lord. "

And especially in situations like this, where there is no immediate physical danger, we have time evaluate possible motives.

However, the red flags that are raised by this behavior are the *same* red flags that are raised by unsettling behavior done in person.

So it is difficult, and unwise, to try to numb oneself to the red flags themselves.

Some people, no doubt, have the ability to segregate these situations. To ""only be upset by this behavior when done in person and threat is clear"" and not ""when done from a distance and immediate threat is unlikely.""

I was still 21 when we married (a week before my 22nd birthday).  The primary reason we married (in my mind) when we did was financial.  She wouldn't live with a man outside of marriage.  I didn't see the point in paying rent at separate places.  I figured we would marry eventually anyway.  So I said fuck it, let's just do it.

Maybe we're the exception that proves the rule?  Sometimes I think we are the couple who beat all odds or something overly romanticized like that.  But it's more likely because she's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I won the lottery there."

If I try to ""market"" myself then it's called lying. I can't win. 

&gt; Guys who have on their profile that they are interested in long term dating (ie we assume these ones are not just looking for hook ups) just write messages with ""hey"" or ""how are you doing tonight?"" Why would they expect that girls would respond?

They probably have no clue girls want more conversation than that. Source: I used to be like that.

Some guys just make no effort what so ever: obviously dirty clothes, bad lighting, blurry web cam etc. While others are downright terrifying like photoshopping the picture to look like a zombie. Why would they not want to put their best face forward so to speak?

Well, some guys think ""just rolled out of bed"" is a hair style. No, that's no style.

Shutting down the run and pressuring the QB is probably a better pass defense than having a shitty front 7 and an awesome secondary because receivers will get open eventually. Especially if you're facing a mobile QB, CBs' jobs would be near impossible.

Keep in mind though that the secondary is not a one man (or 4-man show). They get a lot of help from its front seven. There's a lot of talent there. The combination of personnel they can send out there on 3rd downs and the speed and strength of the LBs matched with Mebane, McDaniel, and Bryant shut down the run (if they stay disciplined).

anon_smithsonian,askscience,1390413598.0,"I had a roommate in college who believed that squeezing the excess air out of a two-liter bottle of soda before replacing the cap helped preserve the soda's carbonation while it was stored. I've never been convinced of this--and, in fact, have come to suspect it actually has the *opposite* effect--but I never really did any tests to prove/disprove/test this since, without the test equipment necessary to capture and measure volumes of gas, determining which had more carbonation would largely be a subjective test measure.

But over the years I've thought about the mechanics and systems involved in this scenario (because, without being able to test this and really get a definitive answer, the idea has continued to linger) and I am curious to know if my thought-process and understandings   involved are correct.

#**Why (I think) this doesn't work:**

* One reason squeezing the excess air out of the bottle does **not** help slow or prevent carbonation escaping the fluid is because the CO`2` escapes the liquid independent of the other available gases outside of it... so having more or less air available inside the bottle does not slow or speed up this process. ^(*Although that isn't entirely correct; see my next point.*)
* The amount of air inside the bottle ***does*** matter in terms of *pressure.* At normal atmospheric air pressure (and below), the CO`2` can escape freely... but as the bottle's pressure increases, it is more difficult for the CO`2`  to get free and the rate of carbonation loss slows. 

#**Why (I think) it actually speeds up carbonation loss:**

* Doing this actually is making it *easier* for the carbonation to escape. If the plastic bottle is closed in its original/natural shape, as CO`2`  escapes the pressure will shortly begin to build up and the rate of CO`2`  loss will slow down. But by deforming the bottle's shape to expel the air before closing it, it actually allows for the bottle to expand and return to its original shape before pressure will be able to continuously build and slow the loss of carbonation.

So, if I'm correct on this thus far, then would the more effective way of stymieing loss of carbonation be by somehow increasing the amount of air (and therefore the pressure) inside of the bottle while it is being stored? 

Is my understanding, here, correct? Am I missing anything? I'd like to have some second-opinions and make sure I'm right before I go and laugh at my old roommate about being wrong about this... but she studied molecular biology so I have to make sure my facts are right."

As has been brought up, BC can be terrible on many women's bodies, I appreciate that you understand that, but also understand that they may make a stand to protect their bodies from pregnancy as they wish. And if that means condoms, then condoms are to be used. Pregnancy does far worse to a woman's hormonal balance, and then if you decide to break up, well...that's an even more undesirable situation for the woman to find herself in, regardless of how much help you say you will give.

And condoms do not weaken any sort of bond, so saying that would automatically put me off, and make me think you were strictly being selfish. The bond comes from the release of chemicals during sex, and those happen with or without condoms. Your (or any individual's) attitude does more to cheapen the connection than anything else."

nevertruly,AskWomen,1390413934.0,"Look to meet women who have their own successful careers.

Edited to elaborate:

It sounds like you were jobless with a bad living situation before you suddenly made your money through bitcoin. Being jobless and in a bad living situation is not attractive to most people because they want to have a partner who is able to be financially and socially stable on their own. Otherwise it is a lot of pressure to take care of and continue to take care of the person (as in, hard to break up because it means they would be making you homeless). There are a lot of people who are 'big plans all the time' who are really 'not going anywhere at all and not really going to.' so they don't know which you are. To be honest, it doesn't sound like you have a job now, so you went from a jobless/bad situation prospect to essentially a lottery winner. If you aren't working and didn't work for your money, there are some women who will still consider dating you pretty risky while others will think that it's a good chance to take. If you are dating young women who don't have their own career and aren't socially/financially stable themselves, then your money is likely to be a lot more of an enticement than it would be to someone who is already happily stable and successful themselves.

One last point, for a lot of women, you actively lying about your situation would be a deal-breaker regardless of the cash involved. For women who are willing to overlook the lying, you will have to just sort through which are simply forgiving people and which are looking to cash in. This kind of thing happens to lottery winners and widows who inherit too - there will always be people who are looking for an easy situation. If you look for people who don't *need* that easy situation, you are more like to find people who are interested in you for yourself.

Homelessness isn't a choice. No one makes the choice to live on the street. To assume these people are free loaders is naive. The VAST majority of homeless people live with some sort of disability and cannot just go get a job. The majority of college graduates can't even get a job. 

And say they are making a decent amount of money. So what? They're homeless. What's wrong with being a good person and sharing the wealth that you have with them? If everyone decided to suddenly stop giving homeless people money, they would die.

Never shave a sammy if you can help it - if you trim them down to the skin it will never grow back right - but just trimming them down to an inch of fur shouldn't cause long term problems. Also, if you do trim, watch being out in the sun too much - their skin isn't made to be directly exposed to the sun, so they sunburn easily if trimmed.

She got tired while playing outdoors a lot faster in summer - she might run around 20 minutes at the dog park before flopping over, where in the winter she'll run around for an hour and still be ready for more. You'd definitely want to avoid having them outside in the heat of the day in Florida - I made sure to walk her around dawn and dusk during the summer so that it was cooler. Make sure your pup gets lots of water! A lot of parks will have water, but I have an H2O4K9 water bottle that I bring to the park so she can get a drink at any time. I also might be over-estimating the amount of exercise that's actually required - she's a spoiled little princess and I cater to her every whim, so she gets to go outside pretty frequently :)

Not sure about the radio and TV - I live in a house so I haven't had to worry about it. She is pretty noisy though - it is apparently her opinion that I'm not allowed to be outside in the yard without her, so when I'm out doing yard work, I can still hear her even though she's inside!"

You are paying for a service, (an education), if you can't understand the professor, tell them. Would you deal with poor service in other areas?

Plus, you're paying thousands of dollars for this degree. Why have someone's accent or poor English negatively harm you and your understanding of the material. If the professor knows you are having difficulty understanding, one would hope they would help you. If not, there is the department head, then the dean. The more of you who state you have a problem, the more likely something will be done.

Tuala08,AskMen,1390414135.0,"1. No, not inflate, but be more descriptive than just say average. What does average mean to them? I have no idea. That tells me nothing about who they are. If they say I like to drink beer, fix cars and watch tv than that gives me a sense. Maybe that is average to them. Or maybe it's I'm an ambitious go getter etc etc.  Just saying 'average' is not informative enough.
2. Well when they just say hey, then I reply with hey, and then what? Nothing happens. Or they ask 'how you doin' and I say 'fine' and again nothing.  What is the point of that? Just wasteless small talk.  All I am looking for is someone to ask a question, show they read my profile and are not just writing hey to every single girl. To me it is as simple as saying ""hey, where are you in picture 3?"" Or ""Hi, you say you like to read, whats your favourite book?"" Just something to show that they took the time to read it, and it gives me a reason to write back.
3.Same sense of humour is great, but why would you start off with the most crazy joke? I would ease someone into it, make a little sarcastic comment and see how they respond.  And why would you start with offensive jokes? Does anyone really like 100% offensive humour?
4. Again not inflate but why can't they turn on the light and put on a clean shirt? I put in effort to either take new photos for my profile or find cool ones from my collection.  I do not cover myself in makeup and get them professionally taken, but I make a point of taking a shower, brushing my hair... just looking overall presentable.
5. Okay, I see your point here. Definitely, if they have a passion share it. Maybe in my area there are just lots of car passionate guys, I just thought it was weird just how many had cars.
6. Yes that one is definitely a bit judgmental but I dont see why a guy would be interested in a girl who is surrounded by other guys. I think it seems like too much work and like the person will always have too many other people to be paying attention to.

captain_craptain,chicago,1390414150.0,"&gt;Also, many of the charter schools are half empty so, no, you don't need to ""win a lottery"" to get in.   

You sure about that?  

&gt;Generally, charter schools admit students based on lottery.  

[The source is cps.edu - look right at the bottom of curriculum.](http://www.cps.edu/Schools/Elementary_schools/Pages/Charter.aspx)  

They may be half empty by CPS standards where they sit children on the big radiator and in makeshift desks to cram them into classrooms sure, but Charter schools don't report directly to CPS.  In fact they are held accountable independently. That is to say they are actually held accountable.  Just because they have a smaller teacher to student ratio does not mean that they are sitting empty.  Sure they could jam-pack more kids in there but that would defeat the purpose of what a charter school is for, better education and better teacher/student interaction.  

&gt; charter schools do not, on average, show greater levels of student achievement, **typically measured by standardized test scores**, than public schools, and may even perform worse.

Perhaps, and most likely, this is due to the vast amount of teacher cheating going on in the CPS system and around the country (See Atlanta) so they can get more Federal funding.   [Source1](http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/JacobLevitt2003.pdf)  [Source2](http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/247) [Source3](http://www.wbez.org/story/illinois-looks-possible-cheating-isats-90157)  [Source4](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/standardized-test-cheating/)  

In fact, one way I can poke even more holes in your theory on standardized testing being relatively equivalent in CPS and charter schools is [this brief that the Chicago Teachers Union created, published and distributed](http://www.ctunet.com/quest-center/research/position-papers/text/CTU_Testing_Position_Brief_web.pdf) themselves denouncing standardized testing as a waste of time and resources.  If they didn't make it so obvious their disdain for standardized testing I might actually question the cheating, but that has statistical evidence to back it as well.  

 * [Article about pros and cons of charter vs public](http://www.publicschoolreview.com/articles/123)  

 * [NPR article critiquing the CREDO study and how it may have been flawed](http://www.npr.org/2013/07/16/201109021/the-charter-school-vs-public-school-debate-continues)  

 * [Article from Center for Public Education breaking down what charter schools are and how most of the studies done to compare them to public are highly flawed studies.](http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/Main-Menu/Organizing-a-school/Charter-schools-Finding-out-the-facts-At-a-glance)  

You can't rely on a single study done with a small sample set where they took student data and created a 'composite student' and then compared them to a 'composite student' from the other side of the coin.  They need to take the time and do comparisons of real actual data over time and stop with this extrapolation bullshit.  

Charter schools have smaller classes, they aren't sitting half empty.  That is a myth put forth by the public schools and their unions, particularly in Chicago because they are upset over public schools closing.  Well they closed the schools with bad test scores....how many of those were charter?  None.  How many teachers cheat on standardized tests?  A lot.  

Now where would you rather have your child go?  I would definitely pick a charter school if I had the option."

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1390414154.0,"Just be aware that women can develop side effects and complications after years of being on the pill.

I was once of those women who happily took the pill will minimal side effects. Years later, the side effects suddenly hit. I completely lost my sex drive. And I developed gallstones and pancreatitis and had to have surgery (which went badly wrong, landing me in the ICU for a week). Now I no longer have a gall bladder. And I had to wait three years after quitting the pill to get my sex drive back. 

If you don't want to get involved with a girl who is on the pill, that's fine. I have no problem with that. You are right - we absolutely have the right to use whatever criteria we want when looking for a partner. But what would you do if your girlfriend suddenly developed side effects or health complications while you were already with her? That's what happened with my bf. When we first started dating, I was on the pill. I went off of it about 8 months into our relationship. So what would you do in that situation? Dump her?

I also am upset with the general attitude in society that birth control should be the woman's burden, and that hormones are no big deal. It is this attitude that got me taking the pill in the first place. And my doctors were more than happy to write the prescriptions without really going over the risks or side effects. If I hadn't grown up with the belief that taking the pill was the only responsible thing to do for a sexually active young woman, I would have given the decision a lot more thought, and I could  have avoided a major surgery, hospital stay, years of illness, and years of no sex drive (which caused me and my bf a great deal of stress). Even now, *in this very thread* I am running into the same attitude that I am irresponsible for having sex without using a hormonal method or the IUD. I am getting judged for not wanting to put foreign substances with medical risks and side effects inside my own body!! As if I don't deserve to have sex unless I'm willing to put my health and well being at risk. THAT is a shaming and sex-negative attitude!

Btw, as to the American thing, I actually think the U.S. are the highest users of the pill, and of hormonal contraceptive methods in general. Probably related to the insane amount of money spent by pharmaceutical companies on marketing the pills. Non-hormonal methods (IUD, pull out, cycle tracking) are most popular in less affluent countries, catholic countries, or among Europeans who strive to live a more natural lifestyle."

ljak,DebateReligion,1390414216.0,"""Gods"" is a very vaguely defined concept. What properties must a thing possess in order to be called a ""god""?

The set of properties has been completely different in different times, different cultures, and different places.

The ""gods"" of Hinduism and Buddhism (devas) are more similar to angels in Abrahamic religions, whereas the ""God"" of Abrahamic religions is more similar to something like the Hindu Brahman (or Atman), which is not considered a ""God"" at all.

In Ancient Egypt, Pharaohs were ""gods"". In many languages, the very word for ""God"" is the same as the word for a very powerful individual (""Elohim"" and ""Adonai"" in Hebrew, ""Lord"" in English). The ""gods"" of [Cargo Cults](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) are actual people from more powerful countries (the US).

If an atheist wants to make his life easy, he just has to use the most outlandish definition. Bearded guy in the sky throwing thunderbolts around (by the way, the term ""atheist"" was first applied to the early Christians due to their rejection of such beings).

Using a definition like Anselm's, Descartes', or Gödel's would complicate things quite a bit, since now we are talking about a philosophical concept and not an anthropomorphic personification for natural phenomena.

Using a definition like Spinoza's, Einstein's, or William Blake's basically eliminates the theist/atheist distinction, rendering the term ""atheist"" meaningless."

it sounds like you need to talk with him and get it all out on the table. if he is encouraging you to have sex with other women because he wants you to be happy, let him know that you are happy with things the way they are. if he is encouraging it because he wants to (1) live vicariously through you, (2) wants to have a ""shot"" at a 3-some with you and another woman, or (3) wants to open up the relationship so that he can have sex with other men or women, then that needs to be addressed.

no matter what the reasons are, you need to talk to him about what you are feeling and thinking. if his talking about those things are making you ""wrong"" then he should know so that he can stop.

both of you need to agree on the terms of your relationship, and if you can't then you need to know that before you go much further. you've only been together for 6 months, so things are still settling but you should have an open and honest conversation about it now, before it becomes a bigger issue."

The Netherlands has a similar requirement for its royalty - all reigning monarchs of the Netherlands must be born on Dutch soil in order to be eligible for the crown.  During WW2, when the Netherlands was invaded by the Germans, Princess Juliana fled to Canada.  As she was pregnant and expected to give birth in Canada, the Canadian government declared the hospital grounds she was staying at to be ""extraterritorial"", and the Dutch government-in-exile immediately filed a claim for the land, which the Canadian government recognised, enabling Juliana's daughter to be born in (temporary) ""Dutch territories"" and therefore be in line for the throne.

I have a ton of vals in there - they're growing back, I actually have them in the back and along the sides, trying to make almost a cut scene like you're looking through the vals and you see this unlikely community I'm trying to set up in the middle of all the lush vegetation.  

I'm currently following these [estimated levels for dosing](http://www.aquariacentral.com/forums/showthread.php?136668-Co2-Fertilization-Algae-and-more-updated-10-10&amp;p=1257519&amp;viewfull=1#post1257519), but running 1 teaspoon of KNO3 since the second burn off which varies anywhere between 10-12 grams for 20 ppm supposedly from the calculator I saw on the sidebar here... 

As to the Dwarf Hair Grass, I completely agree, the problem with this tank is having everything stay in the substrate after planting.  At the top of my ladder, with the tank half full, I am literally taking a bath moving anything in the tank I can't do with my [long plastic tongs](http://www.kensfish.com/aquarium-supplies/aquarium-maintenance/tom-aquatic-gardner-large-274.html) - EcoComplete does not always like to cooperate.  The tank sits about 6' with the canopy off.  Impressive to look at, a bitch to swim in and maintain. 

Edit:  I run my CO2 directly into my filter intake.  I had cardinals in there a month ago - I gassed them accidentially when I was treating BGA and left off the filter and air pump.  Sad day.  The fluval is pointed at the top of the water - creates agitation to increase the exchange of gases.  If I'm already doing that, I'm not worried about a bit more from the air stone.  Directing flow like this also keeps maximum water movement throughout the whole tank - oxygen to all dwellers, and no dead spots.  

To add insult to injury, if they don't stay with roots that are long enough, I watch them drift away in the current I have against the front glass.  I'm actually trying to grow some trimmings/loose plants on my shelf in the back under the light until they are tall enough to submerge better..

CaspianX2,patientgamers,1390414776.0,"A few of these selections are questionable.

Eternal Darkness was a pretty decent hit for the GameCube, and we haven't seen a sequel in part because the developer doesn't make games too often, in part because their last two games (Too Human and X-Men Destiny) received poor reviews, and in part because the developer has shed a lot of employees in the decade since Eternal Darkness was released.

Tenchu was a success on the PSOne, so much that Sony added the game to their Greatest Hits line. And the game is hardly ""forgotten"" - There have been 8 sequels, generally seen by critics as having a steady decline in quality. The last game in the series to receive any decent amount of praise was Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven on the PS2.

Oni over-promised and under-delivered, culling many of its promised features before its release. The final product also had underwhelming graphics (even for the time) and poor AI. Not a bad game, per se, but hardly a ""classic"".

Devil Dice, lauded in its time as a great action-puzzler, actually *did* receive a sequel on the PS2 called Bombastic, which was widely ignored by the general public. And apparently even this article failed to notice its release. Can we blame the developer for not bothering to expend much effort on another sequel?

A few games I would offer up instead as ""forgotten classics"":

Crystalis - At the time, it was seen as a solid alternative to Zelda, yet in the years since, the game has only resurfaced once, with a port/remake on the Game Boy Color.

Startropics - Another game with some similarities to Zelda, and generally respected as a classic on the NES, Nintendo released one sequel on the NES and then never touched this series again (save for quietly releasing it onto the Wii's Virtual Console). The game doesn't even merit an appearance in the Smash Bros. series - not even as one of the game's zillions of stickers!

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project - Everyone remembers the Ninja Turtles arcade game, and a lot of people remember Turtles in Time, but no one ever seems to talk about the game that came out in-between the two. EGM even named it Best NES Game of 1992. Of course, because of licensing issues, Ninja Turtles games haven't exactly been frequent choices for re-releases, but even when the arcade game and Turtles in Time saw a port and re-make to modern consoles in 2007 and 2011, this game was left quietly in the past to collect dust.

X-Men and X-Men 2: Clone Wars (both on the Sega Genesis) - Two of the best X-Men games ever made have never seen a re-release or remake because Sega never acquired the X-Men license again. One wonders what they could have done with the license on the Dreamcast...

The ""Soul Blazer Trilogy"" (Soul Blazer, Illusion of Gaia, Terranigma) - Seen as some of the best action-RPGs ever made, developer Quintet has unfortunately seen a decline in their fortunes in the years that followed, and are now likely a defunct developer. Americans didn't even get the final game in this trilogy (one of the few cases where Europeans were more fortunate), and in the time since not one of them has seen any form of re-release.

Blast Corps - One of the best games on the N64 and one of Rare's greatest games ever, yet Rare has shown little desire to return to this franchise, which is a shame considering how amazing the destruction and explosions could look with next-gen graphics.

Space Station Silicon Valley - Like a cross between a cartoony platformer and Grand Theft Auto, where you would ""jack"" various robotic animals. The game was ported to the PSOne and a Game Boy Color game was made as well, but after that, neither DMA Design nor Take-Two (now Rockstar) have shown any interest in revisiting this title.

The Colony Wars trilogy - Three slick, classics space shooters on the PSOne, followed by.... nothing. In fact, after Sony bought out Psygnosis, and then transformed them into Sony Studio Liverpool, the developer pretty much only worked on Wipeout and F1 games until the studio was closed in 2012. And as much as I love the Wipeout series, that is a sad way for such a great developer to die. Sony hasn't even re-released these games in their PSOne Classics, which doesn't make much sense, since they were pretty popular in their day and Sony still owns all the rights to them.

Einhander - This game was like a wake-up call: Holy crap, Sony can make great games that *aren't* RPGs! Everyone who played this game raved about it as the best shmup in ages. Yet in all the years since, Square has never returned to this series or even this *genre* as far as I'm aware. Pity.

Vagrant Story - Only the third game to ever get a perfect score in Famitsu magazine, this game was gorgeous, a tactical masterpiece, and featured a deep, engaging story, taking place in the same world as Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy XII (which used some elements of its battle system). Still, Square Enix has shown no interest in revisiting the game with any kind of follow-up, probably because the game's director, Yasumi Matsuno, left the company during Final Fantasy XII's development due to illness (possibly in part thanks to the stress of working on the game).

Skies of Arcadia - Probably Sega's last great RPG (well, depending on whether you count Shenmue as an RPG). Sega re-released it on the GameCube, but since then they've never bothered going back to the series, instead merely giving the characters a few cameos in other games.

.... anyway, for fear of seeming long-winded, I'll stop it there, and that's not even getting to more recent consoles, or handhelds for that matter."

SteveCFE,truegaming,1390414844.0,"The characters (except Connor, though for the first few chapters he was fairly good he didn't really develop past that) were all pretty good - Haytham should've been the main character, he was fantastic, and so was his plot twist. The ship part was really good, at first, though became a little repetitive (I believe AC4 fixed this, but I'm still scared to pick it up after playing AC3) and felt too disjointed from the rest of the game. 

The rest of the game was a bit of a mess. The gameplay was a little boring, the storyline was all over the place, and it was all buggy as hell. The game peaked with the early plot twist, which left me wanting more story of that quality - and subsequently being disappointed. 

And don't get me started on the crafting. In every other game I've played, from WoW to KotOR to any other game with a crafting system of any kind, I always get too into it, to the point where when I play ~~Mine~~craft I'm quite happy to let my friends do all the fun stuff and just have me as their crafting-bitch back at base. But AC3's is the first crafting system that I didn't enjoy - hell, I didn't just not enjoy it I actively disliked it. It was so irritating and pointless, and whilst many crafting systems in games are unnecessary (eg-In WoW, and pretty much every game, you can have top tier gear without crafting a single item) the system in AC3 was just plain redundant. It was past the point of being unnecessary fluff, and to the point where it negatively impacted my enjoyment of the game as a whole. 

As I said, I still haven't bought AC4 or any DLC, because I still have the taste of shit in my mouth from AC3. "
FireSail,tall,1390414845.0,"I remember, ever since I was a little kid, I always liked taller girls. I used to be terrified of growing too tall so I avoided milk and drank caffeine as a teen as much as possible. I feel really grateful that I'm this height (5'6""/7"")- it would be torture for me if I was like 6'2"" and had a taller girl kink. So in a way, I feel you bro.

Maybe it's weird - I used to be ashamed of it because of societal pressures - but it's really not a big deal and a lot of times girls are only self conscious about it because of those same societal pressures. I've dated girls from 5'5"" to 6'2"" and while they most all started out concerned about the height thing, once they understood that the man they're with loves it, they really start to embrace it. The current gal I'm seeing is around 5'10"" and has been insecure about her height most of her life - now she proudly goes around and calls herself Amazon Queen. 

My advice to you is scope out tall girls on online dating sites - there's tons - and message one. They'd be thrilled to hear from a tall guy that's not intimidated and actually loves their height. There's probably not many 6'5"" girls around, but a 6'2"" girl in heels should do the trick."

I worked at UTC for a bit, and my god it was disgusting to see how shitty they treated their engineers. The company barely cared about the quality of their products, and discouraged all innovation. The primary goal for the last decade has been extending the life span of outdated products by offering small repairs and updates to parts that are currently out in use, as opposed to creating better aircraft. Even the engineers are run by business majors.

Yes, if something loses you money or barely makes any money, you probably shouldn't do it.

Recently my littlest brother asked me about dental dams.  Yay!  He's been listening to my safe sex talks!  Then he admitted he partially wanted them because he doesn't like the smell and look of his girlfriend's vulva - t's freaky-looking and weirds him out.  But he knows he needs to reciprocate, and likes her doing stuff to him (they're not having PiV sex yet, thank God, he's only 15 and his Mom just died, one thing at a time, dude), and wants her to feel good.  So he thought maybe a dental dam would help, so he wouldn't have to taste it at first until he got used to it - plus also safe sex.  

My response: ""Well... I guess I'll take it.  But let me give you a few pointers.  Pussy is both an acquired taste, and delicious.  If you're  thinking of having sex, and that you're mature enough to do so and all of that... WORK ON ACQUIRING IT, BRO.  Also, if she becomes pregnant, I will ensure it is an only child.

danielbearh,ENFP,1390415054.0,"HS is a bitch. No joke. You're stuck, day in and day out with the same people for years on end. You want to move around and find people who are like you... A good group of friends. The problem is, everyone is changing during this time in your life. People are finding themselves, discovering their voices, what they like and dislike. This often shifts social circles a great deal. And it blows!

I was in your position in HS... I potentially had it worse. I graduated with 32 kids. 11 were guys like me. There were only 3 iNtuitives, two ENTJs and me... I lacked anyone I could connect with, and I really struggled with depression at that time.

The great news is that it gets better. For real. Wait till college... Here's what will be different--most people will be a little bit farther along in understanding who they are. You'll go to a school with thousands of students. You'll find an area of study, extracurricular activities, &amp; groups of friends that -you- actually have more of a say in. You're not locked in the same building with the same people forever.

In college, don't like the people in your classes? Then join a club. A sports team. Your student government. Become an RA. It really just gets better and easier to find friends.

Keep your head high, focus on making yourself the coolest person you can (by learning to give in a relationship what you hope to get,) and by college, you'll be set.

I switched it to a fun joke about what she had studied and that her back up plan is to be an evil scientist, I snuck in that she had been focusing on said schooling but now had more down time, and I truthfully said she was looking after her parents during a difficult time but is soon to be packing up her stuff and does anyone have any recommendations about where to move to?

&gt;In International Dairy Foods Association v Boggs, the 6th circuit found that the two milks are in fact different, disregarding the FDA’s prior determination, and struck down an Ohio regulation prohibiting milk producers from labeling milk as coming from non-treated cows.

Litigation is going to happen, period, and if you don't think so, let's come up with a good definition of ""GMO"" that works in all cases, and doesn't require an extensive regulatory regime to test for possible cross-contamination or escaped traits that would require labeling. We'll have to figure out who has the burden of determining whether a given product is/is not genetically engineered, what that burden consists of, how often it has to be met, any conflicts with federal labeling laws... you get the idea.

My point is that the existence of litigation over an issue cannot be used to show that there is a problem. Did it cost Oakhurst and other dairies money to get that decision? Obviously. It also cost Monsanto a lot of money, I'm sure. But that's just how the world works. Fact is I could file a suit tomorrow alleging that you've arranged to ""crowd-stalk"" me or some other paranoid nonsense, and it'll probably cost you some non-zero amount to get it tossed.

Oh that's bullshit. Saying you prefer it is one thing, but saying you would break it of for HER is just justifying it for yourself. If you don't want to have a relation without condoms that's your choice. But don't pretend you're doing her a favor by breaking it off.

Edit: Let me add this: Even though I would like to respect the fact that different people have different preferences, I think it's extremely weird to break up a relationship over the use of condoms. Especially if even legitimate health issues on her side would not be an acceptable 'excuse' for you.

If I were in the beginning stages of a relationship and you told me the use of condoms would be a dealbreaker for you no matter what my preferences/health issues were, that would be a dealbreaker *for me*.

I would not want to be in a relationship with someone that would rather not be with me than be with me with condoms."

Amonette2012,AskMen,1390415460.0,"Can I comment as a woman here? I feel you're just not very informed about birth control. Let's take a look at the the three most common types of non-barrier birth control and reasons why they aren't just a magic bullet:

-The coil or IUD - these are great - if you can stand having them implanted. They can cause bleeding, pain and other complications, and some women have such tight cervixes that they can't get them in there. I tried to have one put in and it's possibly the most painful medical procedure I have ever endured. Essentially you're shoving something quite large and made of metal into your womb, and a lot of people really don't want to do that.

-The pill: while pills work well for most women, they can also cause weight gain, skin problems and bleeding at any time of the month, and some types can put you at risk of DVT, heart attacks and strokes. Not to mention that forgetting your pill happens, and you're more likely to notice that you've forgotten a condom than you are to notice that you've missed a pill.

-Implants - these can interfere with epilepsy and other medication, cause headaches, bleeding and weight gain as well as other side effects.

Also there are ethical and environmental concerns with hormonal contraception that some women are not willing to accept.

See, what you don't seem to realise is that in order to prevent our own fertility without using condoms, some of us have to accept side effects we don't really want to deal with. It's not as simple as it might seem. It seems to me that you're putting your own sexual enjoyment above the health and wellbeing of someone you're supposed to care about, and this attitude would stick you straight in the 'do not date ever' discard pile for me."

**Defensive coordinator: Ray Horton**  

&gt; Horton has 20 years of NFL coaching experience, including three seasons as defensive coordinator. Last year he was the defensive coordinator for the Cleveland Browns, which ranked ninth in the NFL in yards allowed. Horton also spent two seasons (2011-12) as the defensive coordinator for the Arizona Cardinals, under Titans head coach Ken Whisenhunt. As a player and a coach, he has participated in a total of five Super Bowls during his NFL career.

**Linebackers: Lou Spanos**  

&gt; Spanos has 19 years of coaching experience, including 17 years in the NFL. The past two seasons, Spanos was the defensive coordinator for UCLA. Prior to his time with the Bruins, he spent two seasons as the linebackers coach for the Washington Redskins and 15 seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

**Defensive Backs: Louie Cioffi**  

&gt; Cioffi has 18 years of NFL coaching experience. Last year, he was the defensive backs coach for the Cleveland Browns. Under his guidance, cornerback Joe Haden earned his first Pro Bowl selection as he posted four interceptions. As a secondary group, the Browns ranked eighth in passing yards allowed and third in the NFL in fewest yards per passing attempt (6.15). Before joining the Browns, he spent two seasons (2011-12) with the Arizona Cardinals as the defensive backs coach.

They had been coming back home from a family trip -- her father, mother, and younger sister, who was 7. They were seated in the back row of the plane.

When the stewardesses started to distribute toys to all the children on board, with a ripping sound, a large hole about 1.5m in diameter appeared on the back wall, and she could see something that looked like a large fan. They could see the ocean from the window. When the plane started to descend, the seatbelts cut into her belly and became very uncomfortable; her father, mother, and sister removed them but it was stuck and she couldn't remove it.

The moment the plane crashed, everyone passed out. When she regained consciousness, it was dark. ""Dad, Sakiko (little sister),"" she cried, and was able to touch them in the dark. They were warm, and still alive. Her mother had died instantly. (cont'd)"

Lintheru,compsci,1390415524.0,"Really interesting. Im trained in CS but work in computational biology and definitely have the impression that every piece of code I create is a prototype that is not meant to be shared. Testing is considered time taken away from writing the paper and documenting is frowned upon because ""who is gonna read it .. noone is going to use this after us"". Also I'm hired to do research, not be a software-engineer (this is the mentality of my supervisors). 

I really wish it was different though. My work would feel more meaningful if I could hand it to a grad-student or the next postdoc and let them improve upon it instead of seeing it wither away in a repository somewhere. Unfortunately the pressure to produce at least X papers a year means if I ever have 2 hours available then I should be working on a figure and not refactor or document. Its kind of silly really, because after a year we would be much more productive if the code quality was better. 

I suppose one solution would be to change the funding structure so for every 4 PhDs or 2 postdocs you have working on a software project you should be forced to allocate money for one software engineer to document, maintain and incorporate the new code. If a postdoc is qualified, of course, you could require for 25% of that persons time to be spent on ""software engineering"" tasks. In my current project I think this would be ideal."

FireSail,sex,1390415566.0,"Speaking as a relatively romantically successful short guy...

Most women are going to rule you out. Fine, whatever. You don't want to date most people. 

You're going to have to be totally on-point with everything - how you dress, interact, what you have going on in your life. Girls who have a height limit are going to be too fixated on that. Fuck 'em, whatever. Why chase someone that isn't attracted to you? 

The reason this height thing gets on so many short guys' minds is that most of the avenues we think of as access to finding mates are heavily oriented around appearances. In online dating and at bars where there is a plethora of dudes, women filter by height, generally.

But outside of the meat market is where you can really shine. Social groups, activity clubs, etc., where your passion for things and your character comes front and center. If you connect with a girl that has a similar outlook on life and worldview, that's going to do more for you romantically than anything physical. You'll feel more confident and she'll feel safe and at ease with you.

The whole game of women trying to send signals so that guys ask them out is pretty lame, I agree. In most situations I don't mind asking the guy out just to cut to the chase. But once we are on a date we are testing not just sexual chemistry but the ability to have fun with each other. The former may be hard to tell but the latter should be something you can tell if you have social skills. Things like: does she genuinely laugh or just smile?

Maybe they talk too fast, or too quietly, or a million other reasons. If you are paying for a course, I better be able to understand the words coming out of their mouth.

Best example, I completely understand the English coming out of my 4 year olds mouth because I'm around him all the time, and know/understand his way of speaking. A stranger, or even my parents have difficulty because they aren't use to his ""English"". Because I have a 4 year old, I can understand most 4 year olds because their English is generally the same. 

If I have 5 classes, all taught by 5 different nationalities, ones I haven't experienced before, even though they are all ""speaking English"" there is a good chance I will have difficulty understand each one. Though the severity will vary. I'm only around the 45 to 75 minutes 2 to 3 times a week for 15 weeks. There is no way I could learn all their English speaking quarks in that time so I can also learn the material. And I shouldn't have to. 

If, as a student, I'm having a problem understanding the words coming out of their mouth, I have ever right to ask them to help me understand them better. Either provide better notes, or slow down, or allow me extra one on one time to get information cleared up on the subject matter.

I'm a native English speaker and I have a tendency to speak quickly. I remember being with a group of german kids. They spoke English, but my speed hindered their understanding. Once they told me I was able to modify my speed and there was no more confusion. "

Unrepentant_Priapist,todayilearned,1390415864.0,"Urban/Rural and alcohol don't appear to have much to do with the disparity:

It's already normalized for population; it's sorted by ""Deaths per 100,000 People"".  The DOTs [data for vehicle ownership](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/pl08021/fig3_2.cfm) doesn't suggest that car ownership is lower in urban states; it actually seems to point somewhat in the opposite direction (I wish they provided raw numbers rather than just a picture).

A bit of cursory googling revealed [numbers on drunk driving fatalities by state](http://www.madd.org/blog/2013/november/2012-drunk-driving-fatalities.html).  I averaged them out using the red/blue classification from the submitted chart, skipping Puerto Rico as it isn't in the original data.  The averages are basically indistinguishable; 30.6% for red states, and 30.7% for blue.  It's not surprising, the numbers for all of the states are pretty close.

While I was averaging, I averaged the raw numbers of traffic deaths from the original chart; the average red state had 665 traffic deaths, and the average blue state had 626.  Pretty close, which is actually statistically odd, given that the average red state has two thirds the population of the average blue state (4,870,754 and 7,402,424 respectively).

A possible potential cause is a disparity in vehicle miles driven; [this link](http://dc.streetsblog.org/2012/11/20/why-traffic-deaths-are-more-common-in-red-states-than-in-blue-states/) references our chart and speculates that this is the cause.  Averaging [this data](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/13juntvt/page6.cfm) (I used the June 2012 numbers) reveals that there were 4,326.33 million vehicle miles traveled in the average red state, compared to 5,615.30 million in the average blue state.  So, DC Streets Blog got it wrong; if there were a correlation, we would expect traffic fatalities to be 23% lower in red states, not 6% higher.

The only other potential cause I could come up with is that people in blue states are anecdotally more affluent, and as such might be, overall, driving newer cars with better safety equipment.  I couldn't find numbers for average vehicle age by state, just the national average of ten years.  But, numbers for median income are [readily available](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/statemedian/), and with raw data, so we can test that hypothesis.  The average household income in red states is $57,942.74, and $69,330 for blue states.  So, the data bears out the anecdote regarding general affluence.  Without vehicle registration stats, though, it's impossible to say whether that translates into the vehicle fleet being newer in blue states, and the hypothesis might be a stretch anyway.

I'm not sure we can draw any conclusions as to why the disparity exists.  Various other statistics suggest that the quality of life in blue states is generally higher than in red states, and this may be considered supporting evidence for that conclusion.  Unless Democratic policy is significantly better than Republican policy, which isn't a conclusion that I necessarily subscribe to, I would agree with you that it's unlikely to be related to election patterns."

as for him, it is very possible that he wants to be with a man - he is bisexual too, right? it's also possible that he just wants to have sex with multiple people.

the thing is this, in every relationship there is give and take. no one gets all their needs met by one person, but if you are monogamous and committed, you learn to live without getting those needs met. that's part of being in a relationship. so if he can't do that, you need to know now and find someone who can.

&gt; he should try to talk to me instead of give an order

absolutely. you are a person not a machine, animal, or slave. you have the right to be given a choice and to be talked to about your options and whether you want to do a certain thing. if he is pushing you to do something you don't want to, or trying to ""make"" you do something you are against, then he is not treating you like a person anymore."

As for having a girlfriend suddenly get side effects is a completely differenth thing to me altogether. That would be a person Ive been with for a (most likely) long time, and I already have a deep bond with. It is completely different to me than starting up a new relationship that has restrictions from the get go. 

A few years back I had a girlfriend who I loved beyond everything, the one that got away if you will. She developed cancer in her vagina, I dont know the english word of where it was, the mucous membrane maybe? Im not sure. Anyhow, it prevented all sex from being done, as her sexdrive went to 0, which was understandable. I stayed throughout, supported her all the way.

So yeah, if my girlfriend suddenly had serious side effects, then screw everything, Ill gladly do it. I just wont invest myself in something, that I know will annoy me. It is a different story altogether, adapting to a person you love with all your heart, than someone youve just met.

What Ive described through my posts, are my ideals of what I want in a girl and what would be a no-go for me. So it all depends, as everything does, on the situation. "

Squick warning: Disturbing imagery to some

Over a span of two or three weeks, I turn a sexy girl into an object. I do a variety of things to her, but only a little each time, dragging it out. I also have sex with her whenever I'm horny and feed her with a funnel whenever I need to use a toilet. At some point, I probably cut a hole in her to painfully fuck, maybe in one of her tits.

The first day, I damage her vocal chords so she cannot speak. The second day, I suck out her eyeballs, sucking on them while still attached before popping them in my mouth like grapes. Then next day, I remove her fingernails with pliers. The next day it's her toenails. Then I begin amputating parts of her (which I cook and eat)... Fingers, toes, hands, feet, lower left arm, upper left arm, repeating this segmentation on her other limbs... I use a meat slicer to remove her tits, set to the thinnest slice setting, and make sandwiches for myself from the sliced meat.

The resulting torso when I'm done would be a weakened fucktoy and toilet that slowly dies of malnutrition. She should be light enough at this point that I can just pick her up and use her like a fleshlight, moving her entire body up and down on my cock.

When she finally dies, I remove her head and see what it feels like to fuck a neck hole (body side). I then clean her torso and take what edible meat is left to eat from her. When I get horny again during this process, I try fucking her other neck hole (head side). I might fuck her aorta at some point too...

For me, this is a sexual fantasy that I masturbate to. I have no intention of actually doing it, but it would be so sexy if I did. It's the worst way I can think of for someone to die."

captain_craptain,chicago,1390416161.0,"Actually Henry Ford created the 5 day work week and healthcare has been around for centuries.  Much longer than any union.  

http://worldhistoryproject.org/1926/9/25/henry-ford-announces-5-day-work-week  

http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/ford-factory-workers-get-40-hour-week   

http://images.rarenewspapers.com/ebayimgs/12.28.2009/image071.jpg  

They may be responsible for the 10 and then later on the 8 hour workday but that certainly isn't the standard everywhere these days.  Everyone I know in transportation puts in at least ten hours a day if not more, same for sales and other lucrative jobs.  The only jobs that may still rely on the 8 hour schedule are the menial and simpler jobs like retail, warehouse labor and other unskilled labor.  

I will bitch all I want to because I've been a Teamster, I was one for six years.  I didn't have a choice because Illinois has stupid union shop laws and I wasn't allowed to leave.  Believe me I tried, they did nothing for me other than try to pressure me into voting for the people they liked and taking money from my paycheck with no real return.  

So why would I want to pay some idiots to sit in a union office and figure out ways to be a loudmouth and influence politics in my state so their Democrat cronies stay in office and in turn keep cities and states like Illinois and Chicago bankrupt because they are unable to elect a single competent politician?    What's the upshot here?  

They served a purpose at one point in time, they have outgrown their usefulness and are just a little conjoined fetus twin hanging off of businesses clinging to life and sucking blood from their host while at the same time trying to kill their host by regulating it out of existence.  

We now have OSHA, the NLRB and other government agencies that can and do handle all of the responsibilities that unions once had.  Oh and by the way, the unions may be loud but they aren't nearly as big as they make themselves out to be which is why I hate their picket lines.  Because they pay people to come in and make them look like more than they are, unions protest in 'solidarity' with other unions.  AKA ""I'm a zombie and don't know why we are protesting, but I love making picket signs and that blow up rat is awesome!""  

Unions only make up about [11.3% of the working population](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm)  They are 35% of public sector employees which is absolutely awful...and the rest of us honest hardworking Americans have to constantly listen to you guys bitch and moan about how you deserve more and now.  Well guess what princess, you can't always get what you want and sometime you need to work hard to get it, not just punch a clock and show up on time.  

So anyways, yeah unions suck.  They are not what they used to be and need to go away."

Borror0,Quebec,1390416200.0,"Dans le contexte actuel, la croissance d'emploi faible de la dernière année peut, du moins en parti, être blâmée sur la hausse des redevance minières.

Cet effet n'a pas été ressenti dans le reste du Canada, alors que nous partageons la même politique monétaire, alors c'est le résultat d'un changement de politique gouvernementale. 

Bref, réduire un peu les redevances serait probablement une bonne première étape.

Par la suite, il y a un bon nombre de changements que le gouvernement peut faire pour faciliter l'investissement et le développement économique, sans que ça lui coûte rien. Réduire le salaire minimum, réforme de la fiscalité (plus de TVQ, moins d'impôt, moins de crédits d'impôt) avec un impacte neutre sur les revenus, réévaluation des normes de certains industries, etc. 

Parfois, le problème est que l’interventionnisme maladroit de l'État est la cause du problème. L'imposition des standards de la classe moyenne en logement rend les loyers à prix modique plus rare, par exemple.

I was at a gas station down south and some guy in a pickup truck pulled in behind me and yelled ""Hey you"" really loud and started walking towards me.  He was walking with an aggressive posture.  He was very muscular and was flexing as he approached.  He started giving me some sob story about needing money to buy diapers.  He got really close and was in my personal space.

At no time did he ever say anything like ""give me money or I'm going to kick your ass"".  He just kept standing really close while flexing and ""asking"" for money.  At one point I turned and looked at the cashier in the building.  It was late at night, and we were the only two people at the gas station.  When I looked over at her, he was still talking about diapers when he suddenly stopped mid sentence and said ""she ain't gonna help you"".  At that time it was obvious that he was indeed robbing me in a very unorthodoxed way.

I pulled out my wallet half expecting him to cold cock me and take it.  But he didn't.  I gave him a $20 and he gave me one of those shoulder ""bro bumps"" and said thanks.

This was before I started carrying a concealed pistol.  If that happened again I don't know how I would react, but I probably would have warned him to keep his distance, and if he continued toward me then I would draw.

Is the game headed in a good direction according to you guys? Or is it going downhill slightly? Really wondering what reddit thinks of it as I feel it's been going downhill slightly.

When I got mine, I removed the stock, grip &amp; rails while disassembling the rifle into its main components. I then rinsed the metal pieces with mineral spirits and then let them sit in the spirits for only about 20-30 minutes. My gun was in pretty decent condition, minus the remnants of them drilling out the stock- that plastic stuff was all over the rifle's innards. I took them out, dried them off, cleaned out anything that was still floating around inside, and then assembled it while lightly oiling it.

Hope that helps, and enjoy the gun!"

Eagle-Eye-Smith,lebanon,1390416611.0,"Israeli here. Let me try and explain things from this side, and please, **please** read all the way through.

Annexing Lebanon, or any of the parts of Lebanon, is currently not in the interest of the Israeli government. Why? Well, the Israeli public wouldn't give them any support towards it. It's one of the reasons that they backed all the way to southern Lebanon after the invasion of 82- Keeping Lebanon would have been a logistical nightmare with no feasible positive outcomes, because no Israeli civilian really gave a shit (other than security threats, hence the southern Lebanon ""buffer zone"").

The attitude I see a lot of times, especially from people in arab countries, is that Israel just wants to expand everywhere. Nope. The Israeli government was always more focused on the West Bank, mostly because it was driven by the ""Dati Le'umi"" (""National Religious"") crowd- The west bank, to them, feels more ""Israeli"" than mainland Israel itself- It's ""Judaea and Samaria"", locations that appear prominently in the bible, with a lot of Jewish holy sites and biblical sites. And these guys have some close friends in the Israeli government.

I don't know what you guys think, but the vast majority of the Israeli public **hates** the settlers. They're annoying, racist, childish, they treat the IDF like it's their private military, and generally think that they're above the law (since, according to them, the law of the Torah comes before any civilian law). You might remember a news story from a few weeks ago, about how a group of settlers walked into a palestinian village and started throwing stones, were caught, and almost lynched, only to have some people in the village defend them from severe beating. After this story was published on Walla, an Israeli news site, whose visitors are almost universally right wing, 90% of the comments were about how the settlers should have gotten their asses kicked harder than they were. 

The reasons we keep them in the West Bank are-

a) They prevent future Israeli governments from pulling out and thus ""endangering"" the Israeli public (many people in Israel believe that if Israel withdraws from the west bank, it's going to turn into a terrorist hub with missiles in close range to major Israeli cities)

b) They're extremist-religious dumbasses, so we might as well stick them over there instead of having them fuck things up in mainland Israel

c) They're Jews, so even if they're really annoying, the Israeli public feels they're still a part of ""our"" group, in a sense- The annoying uncle of the Jewish family.

Now, while the Dati Le'umi crowd is a minority in Israel, it's quite a large minority- I believe about 13-18%. The rest of the citizens of Israel couldn't give less of a fuck about the occupied territories in the West Bank. Their concerns about the region are purely security based. Shit, I have friends here who couldn't point to where the West Bank is on the map.

So, how does this tie-in to Lebanon? Well, the Dati Le'umi crowd doesn't really give a shit about Lebanon, it never did. It's mentioned in the bible once or twice, but other than that... Meh. It was never really predominantly Jewish, there aren't any Jewish holy sites there, and it's generally uninteresting to the Jewish religious crowd in Israel. And with the rest of the secular population not really caring, the Israeli government really had no incentive to take Lebanon for themselves. It's just pointless. The only reasonable incentive for staying in southern Lebanon throughout the years was the security incentive, and that was blown out the window once Hezbollah managed to increase their missile range and hit targets while still staying north of occupied southern Lebanon. Eventually, the Israeli public realized that the whole thing is stupid, and elected Ehud Barak, who in his campaign promised that if he is elected, he will withdraw the IDF from southern Lebanon (which indeed happened).

TL;DR- Israelis don't really care about Lebanon. Snap out of your superiority complex."
Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390416614.0,"In case you haven't noticed, the culture of this particular subreddit is not one of brutal onslaughts of critique without respite, nor one of lack of concern for the consequences of the things that we say, and the way that we say them. I'm sure you can find other subreddits that might suit you better.

*Utter failure*, *shittiest thing I've ever fucking seen*, *shitty painting*.

You're directing your own anger and frustrations over who-knows-what (perhaps your own art?) at someone who's barely getting started - someone who's likely at a stage where being berated by someone like you might push them away from art, instead of encourage them to correct their mistakes and pursue it further.

Often in the middle of the night, if I wake up, I'll find him sleeping on his back with his legs up, as if he were propping a book up on his lap or something. He looks ridiculous, and sleeps like that no problem. He likes to grope me in his sleep, which I think is really cute. He'll roll over and cuddle me, and if his hand slips by my butt, he'll give it a couple squeezes, all while he snores away. He also has a tendency to fart in his sleep, which is almost always followed by a quiet ""heh-heh"" and then snores. If you ask him things in his sleep, he will respond back, but his garbled responses are hilarious. I always give him a kiss goodbye in the morning and say ""I love you baby"", and he always responds back, but it always comes out as ""Iyuuuhfwtuh"". 

But my favorite thing is when I wake up in the morning. He's usually facing opposite of me when I wake up, and no more than a few seconds after I get out of bed, without fail, if I look back, he will *always* instantly be spooning my pillow.

I had difficulty dating between the ages of 22 and 27. I spent much of that time concentrating on getting a Master's Degree, advancing my career, and remodeling a run-down house to live in. I went on *many* first dates during that time, a handful of second dates, and never once had a ONS. I don't feel that I missed out on anything, I don't feel that I was pressured to do one thing or another, and I don't think that society has cast me any particular role that I must play.

No known snake could get their mouth around an adult human's shoulders unless the person had an abnormally small frame, and even then, only the largest few of the largest species of snake would be able to manage that much. You're 100% safe from this.

I've looked into it to know realistically what species of snake would be the most likely to be able to swallow someone whole and alive because that's a fantasy that turns me on. Anacondas come the closest, but still can't pull it off.

Also, even if a snake could, no snake would. Large snakes like that constrict their prey first, killing them fairly instantly via crushing. No slow painful digestion.

Serae,AskReddit,1390416898.0,"It's not really a question that needs to be asked, honestly.  Generally interaction should make someone's intentions clear.  You can just ask and inform, ""Hey, I have kids and don't have a lot of time away from them.  I would love to hang out but I need you to know that I am a package with my kids.  If having kids around isn't your thing, that's fine.  But I want you to know what to expect if you want to get together.""  Honest communication is great.  

Or just look at how the other person reacts.  Let's say you have kids and I am the person without kids showing interest.

""Hey, want to get together sometimes?""

A yes or no answer will suffice.  We try to make plans.  If you want to bring your kids this is the time to bring it up.  Make it clear whether or not hanging out with you means I will be interacting with your child more often than just having one-on-one time.  It helps when making plans.

Maybe the thing we are trying to plan (wine tasting for example) isn't kid friendly.  Obviously if I turn you down I'd let you know that I wouldn't want to bring a child to a winery.  However, if you're game for another activity we can do something else.  Maybe a museum, zoo, aquarium, public garden and lunch?

If things went well and were fun then bringing a kid along isn't such a big deal.  There are things that both kids and adults can do together for fun.  Would I prefer to spend one on one time with the adult?  Sure, but if they are going to bring their kid along that doesn't mean the relationship has to end.  Not at all.

An example of avoiding someone with a child I would assume means that the person would constantly turn down offers to hang out or they, themselves, would never approach you to do something.  

I hope that helps a little?"

jareths_tight_pants,Hair,1390416969.0,"Your thinking of a relaxer, which is a chemical process that breaks the bonds of your hair so it can be shaped then re-formed. It's similar to a perm, which makes straight hair curly by wrapping the hair around rods then dousing it in permanent solution. A relaxer is something that African Americans do to straighten their hair. It is permanent, but I'm not sure that's what you're looking for. Most women who style their hair do it daily using a flat iron or a curling iron or a blow dryer and a special round brush."

She would stop when she got to a V, and visibly would strain to putting a W sound (like wector, willain, and wiolet). I finally told her that she was trying way too hard and to just do the V like she would in German. I told her that while it wouldn't be completely correct, it would feel and sound more natural than a W sound and would keep her from having to strain every time she came to a V. Over time after that she started doing that, her V's morphed into the more correct English V than the German V. I was proud of that one."

I've seen girls in bars pull the ""he touched me/tried to grab my ass"" sexual harassment card and see a poor guy get his ass kicked by a bunch of whiteknights simply because he refused to buy some random girl a drink.

That's right, *not* buying free drinks for women now ""constitutes aggression"". This guy uses ""whiteknights"" and ""beta"" unironically so you know he's the real deal.

&gt;[I have always wondered, wouldn't it be cheaper in the long run to pay for sex with a hooker, then have a wife? Over the lifetime of marriage, you could spend well more on wife's upkeep, then on hookers. Plus you don't have to listen to the hooker yell at you. And hookers are probably better at sex. And hooker can't divorce you and take all your shit. Unless you marry her, but the she becomes a wife. I've read somewhere that ex-hookers make best wives...](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1vt3ey/to_the_guy_who_said_but_i_bought_you_a_drink_when/cevviuw)

Not sure where that came from....

&gt;[I think I'm the only one that likes to treat women, and doesn't expect anything in return. Even when my wife's friends are in town (we live out of state) I always treat them. Call it misogynist, call it chivalry, call it white knighting...call it old fashioned, but I was brought up to act like a gentlemen, and always treat a lady.](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1vt3ey/to_the_guy_who_said_but_i_bought_you_a_drink_when/cevqq1o)

Medical mj is fucking legal in Illinois, just fucking accept it already and stop making baseless associations between cancer patients and people who break the law just because they find relief from their symptoms from smoking it. 

There is zero correlation between the two. And I would like to know what exactly this fear mongering legislation is based on. Let's look at Colorado...we're already a few weeks into them having free access to marijuana, has that state turned into satan's playground? Have people stopped going to work just so they can toke up? Have people been running around shooting at random strangers, has crime gone up at all because of their unrestricted access to marijuana? No. So, whyyy on earth are we still afraid or allowing people access to medically appropriate care? 

Why is there a $150 annual fee to get access to marijuana? I wish they would explain that. That's amazing to me! Oh yeah you got cancer, that fucking sucks for you man. We'll just go ahead and extort money from you based solely on the misfortune of needing a medication that relieves some of your suffering. Feel like a criminal yet? No? Well let's throw in some fingerprinting on top of that. 

Here's what really sets me off as a nurse. Some people use marijuana to relieve them of pain. Now, our standard pain medications are narcotic based, and the side effects are severe, people develop a tolerance, people die because they OD on pain medications, they vomit because the amount of narcs they need is so high it makes them nauseated. Their bowels stop working, all sorts of complications arise from this, let's not forget that we are giving people addictive medications that could lead to them developing an unhealthy dependency on this drug. Marijuana doesn't have any of these problems. It could be a great alternative, and can probably stimulate people's appetites instead of suppressing them like chemo and narcs tend to do.

Also, these people...who are cancer patients and spend much of their time in hospitals...are not going to be allowed to smoke their weed while they are in a hospital. Yeah...because whoever made these rules is a fucking genius.

lim (A/B) = lim A / lim B, and lim (A + B) = lim A + lim B. These are nontrivial results, so don't use them without first proving them, unless your professor has allowed you to.

Another powerful tool is the monotone convergence theorem. 

let a_n be monotone increasing, with upper bound M, and b_n be monotone decreasing, with lower bound L. The monotone convergence theorem says that a_n and b_n converge. If it's possible to show that M = sup{a_n}, or that L = inf{b_n}, you can say that a_n -&gt; M and/or b_n -&gt; L

For your specific problem, try multiplying xn by (1/n)/(1/n), and use the fact that for the natural numbers: 1/n, 1/n^2, 1/n^3, ... are all monotone sequences (make sure to show that this is true if you haven't already!)."

Qinella,DebateAChristian,1390417195.0,"&gt;Could they walk on water? Or feed 5000 people? Or raise the dead? Or come back from the dead themselves? There are tricks, and then there are miracles.

The point isn't about magnitude. And you know what? I would be amazed if someone could actually turn a staff into a living snake, probably more impressed than turning water into wine. My point is that magic tricks don't prove divinity (as you admitted in your earlier post, despite providing the miracles as evidence for divinity).

&gt;To what end though? And how could you attribute to Satan all the good works Jesus did? He healed countless people, upheld the Law of Moses, displayed an incredible example of love and grace, showed deep knowledge of scripture.
Jesus was quite obviously a good, sinless man and teacher, certainly worthy of a rabbinical following, even excluding the miraculous works. 

Again, this fits within the Christian framework. Satan is known as ""the deceiver"" because he seems charming and good but is actually tricking you. And why wouldn't he know the scripture? In Matthew 4, it says he knew the scripture as well as Jesus. It makes perfect sense (again, within the Christian framework) that Jesus could have been an agent of Satan working to deceive the Jews.

&gt;He never exhibited any sorts of lies and deception, other than to caution his followers not to reveal him as the Messiah (he did this on his own).

If he was actually an agent of Satan, then the entire thing would have been a deception. But if he's trying to trick people into thinking he is the son of God, of course he would not outwardly exhibit poor behavior.

&gt;Could Jesus have actually been a tool of Satan? Could the adversary of God also be one of his most outspoken preachers? It seems highly unlikely.

How does likelihood have any bearing on this discussion? Miracles are unlikely, yet you believe they occur.

&gt;I'm not sure your background, but is that how some other religions, e.g. Judaism, view Jesus? As someone trying to divert the Chosen people away from God?

How is this relevant? Are you trying to set up an ad hominem argument?

The point is that you have absolutely no way of demonstrating or even arguing that Jesus was not actually an agent of Satan and that the entire writing and canonizing of the Bible was influenced by Satan. If you believe there is an evil being that has power to influence things on earth, this is entirely possible.

omgwtf_throwaway,asktransgender,1390417242.0,"Stats I've read (source is the praeger handbook of transsexuality) state that the numbers in modern times are near equal.

The book mentions that there are a couple reasons for the disparities in the old studies. First, trans men were just not seeking medical treatment, and were just presenting male and socially transitioning on their own. Second is gatekeeping, as trans men who *did* present for treatment did not often receive a diagnosis or hormones due to the overwhelming focus of the medical community of the time on straight trans women.

I think the rumor still persists because the media sensationalism that still surrounds trans women, and because how trans men may feel unwelcomed in trans communities at times.

CaspianX2,videos,1390417293.0,"Others here are pointing out that he's ineligible. As a Californian, I want to stand by gabesunday to say that even if he were, he is not someone you'd want leading the country.

After Schwarzenegger was elected, he pushed through a special election that California didn't want, to try to force California to accept ballot propositions that were all seen as unpopular. They were all defeated (by up to a margin of 30 points), and the whole thing was seen as a waste of money during a time of fiscal hardship.

On top of this, rather than working to come to a compromise with the state's Democrat-controlled legislature, he simply blamed them, infamously calling them ""girlie-men"" at one point.

His effectiveness as governor only improved when he reluctantly started bringing his policies back from the right to the center, but by that point his agenda had deflated.

By comparison, current governor Jerry Brown has done a tremendous job bringing California back from the brink, largely because he's been shrewd and fiscally responsible, making calculating cuts to California's budget and in turn asking voters to pass propositions that, while not very popular, were intended to help solve our budget crisis. They passed, and in that same election our state legislature got a Democratic supermajority for the first time in 80 years (thus giving them the power to finally overcome the Republicans' obstruction).

As a result of these things, California now has a budget surplus and is actually passing budgets more or less on-time, something that seems like it hasn't happened in ages in this state. And while I'm not thrilled with every decision Brown has made, I have to hand it to the man that he took what was seen by many to be a hopeless situation and turned it around into a much brighter one.

For all Arnold's fame, his political legacy is one of squabbling with unions and legislators, and this is absolutely *not* what our nation needs right now in a leader. I don't think it's what our nation *ever* needs. And as much as I respect the man as an action star, bodybuilder, charity organizer, and all-around likeable personality, I don't want him to go back into politics *ever again*."

jareths_tight_pants,AskWomen,1390417332.0,"You're probably not letting the stuff dry down or you're using products that are incompatable with each other. Foundation and concealer need a clean surface. You can use a moisturize/spf before, but it should be completely dry. Wait at least 15 minutes before applying foundation. I use my fingers. I dot it on then rub it around then pat it so you can't see streaks. Let that set up for a minute. Then apply concealer, wait another minute. Then finish setting it with powder. Don't rub your brush/sponge on your face, pat or roll. You don't want to dislodge what you just did.

If you have oily skin you can use a mattifying primer (wait 1 minute before foundation). Liquids work best. Cream foundation is for dry/normal skin.

If your mascara and eyeliner are smearing on your face then it's probably your moisturizer. Again, everything should be dry before you apply any cosmetics. You can take a tissue and press it around your eye to absorb any left over dampness after the under eye moisturizer has soaked in for 15 minutes. It could also be that the eyeliner is too soft. Try a waterproof one instead of a kohl one.

And no, makeup doesn't have to be expensive. Some expensive products work better or last longer but overall you can find decent stuff at the drugstore. Milani and NYX are great drug store brands.

Well, our TA was a nice Chinese girl whose English was very good except for a few little hangups. One problem was that whenever she said ""Bonus,"" it came out ""Boners."" There were many many times when our entire lab section had to stifle laughter when she would talk about ""All the boners you're going to get!"" or how we ""Really needed to think about the boners,"" or to ""Make sure that you can hold more boners.""

Edit: 

TL;DR of how the conflict began and riots started - Ukrainian government pissing off citizens as they were displaying characteristics of an authoritarian regime. Ukrainians wanted to be a member of the EU and were close. Putin started whispering in the ear Viktor Yanukovych (Ukrainian President) and Vik backed out of EU talks. This was the boiling point and protesters gathered. 

Since they began (2 months ago) there have been scores of skirmishes, but these are the first deaths. The violence has increased in frequency over the last week, but it hasn't been completely peaceful until this point in any way.

A lot of it is illegal, but I've done and said stuff that I can't help but question now.  I really thought something was wrong with me to the point I found myself destroying some of my childhood pictures, and that isn't cool.

I finally realized that my entire life.  From that borderline ""we should IQ test this kid"" type stuff to my strong moral convictions are biproducts of the people around me trying to protect my innocence.  I was such a happy kid, but it went on for too long.  It made me selfish, and it also made me a little desperate.  

My older brother and my younger/twin brother hung out all the time, and they hung out with a bunch of the neighborhood kids.  That left me with one friend, and we'd watch our brothers who were effectively the same age as us go hunting, get into fights, go to concerts, drink, and smoke way before any of us should.

Our sameish age brothers got to do grown up stuff while we didn't, so we emulated them.  It wasn't until fairly recently that I learned some of the sick shit the older kids put the younger ones through for ""initiation"". They tried to help me, but the exclusion drew us right into it in other ways.

I'm not saying my fucked up shit isn't my fault, I'm just trying to express how insanely complicated things were, and are when raising children.  I honestly don't think I can handle it."

captain_craptain,chicago,1390417504.0,"&gt; Charter schools only have a lottery if they have more applicants than applicants.

More applicants than openings you mean?  

Sure that makes sense, and since the CPS site says that it typically is by lottery only goes to show that they have a high demand when there are openings.  I have seen documentaries/news-clips that show how hard people try to get in.  There must be a lot of demand if they need to do a lottery and CPS says that this is the normal method of accepting kids.    

&gt;Charter schools SHOULD score higher because they can kick any student out for any reason, a ""luxury"" CPS schools don't have. CPS teachers/schools have to educate all comers, no exceptions.  

I think your reasoning is flawed.  CPS may not be allowed to just kick kids out (what ever happened to expuslion?...)  but Charter schools **don't want** to kick their kids out.  They are looking for the easy out like a CPS official might be.  They took these kids in to help them improve, they have highly motivated educators who have an incentive to turn around a problem child.  

Plus any kid who got into a charter school obviously has a parent that cares about them or they wouldn't have tried to win the lottery and get their kid in.  Do you really think a parent like that would just ignore disciplinary issues and not do anything to work with the school to correct it?  

Plus they won't kick a kid out for doing poorly on a test, they will work with them on improving for the next one.  *After all, that is what they scored the best on.  Improving the test scores of lower class and English learning students. So it's not like they turn away ESL kids.*  

And the biggest thing you missed from above that I hoped would have prevented you from thinking #2 was a valid point was that the studies that compares the test scores uses **composite students**, as in imaginary, made up from a set of statistics.  How can you really compare a composite student from a charter school with that of a composite student from a public school when, as you pointed out, kids that don't cut it in the charter school go back to public school?  

The study is flawed, CPS teachers cheat to boost scores and I just don't think the comparison is valid.

Capatown,EvilAsks,1390417554.0,"Nelson Mandela was the head of UmKhonto we Sizwe, (MK), the terrorist wing of the ANC and South African Communist Party.

-Amanzimtoti Shopping complex KZN, 23 December 1985

-Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court, 17 March 1988

They both can fuck up your organs pretty badly if you overdo it, which plenty of people do.

And yet, people consider LSD to be a hard drug - relatively speaking, it's pretty harmless, it's not addictive, doesn't stay in your system, and it's not something that people really do on a consistent basis.  You do it once, and then if you feel like doing it again, it's really not for a while at least - it's almost never (if ever) an everyday thing.

mrcleanup,atheism,1390417734.0,"Well, if you are religious... Check out the gospel of inclusion.

The story goes like this. A charismatic christian pastor rises through the ranks and founds a megachurch, he is heavily respected and backed by big names in the Christian community, he is responsible for getting other big name pastors started too, TD Jakes among them. And then one day while he is watching TV and they are showing terrible conditions in (I believe it was) Somalia, he realizes that these people, starving children and all, are already in hell. He asks god why he lets this happen, and God asks in return why he doesn't go help them, and he cries and responds that the world is too big, he can't help everyone find god. At which point god reveals to him that he is exactly right and that is why he sent Jesus to redeem everyone. The only hell, he is told is the hell we create for ourselves here on earth. There isn't any hell waiting, everyone has already been redeemed. God found us unable to achieve salvation on our own, he knew we could never do it, so he sent Jesus to fix it... done.

Now clearly this pastor was quickly abandoned by the church because if there is no hell then there is no requirement to go to church or tithe, or even find Jesus, you have already been redeemed no matter what. And that isn't great for revenues or political influence.

It has been a slow business rebuilding a congregation under this new philosophy, but the movement has been growing. It's interesting how quickly the church can switch from praising one of it's leaders as a mouthpiece of god and then so quickly denounce them for blasphemy when they don't like what god says.

If god is love, the answer can be pretty clear, there is a hell, but we made it, and in death you find only the sweet embrace of god, you leave the corruptions of man behind.

Now, granted, this is all advice from an agnostic atheist on reddit, so take it all with a grain of salt."

HumanSockPuppet,TheRedPill,1390417744.0,"No. In a society where females are not culturally forced into being faithful, what you have is a majority population of (beta) males with no incentive to work or contribute to society. That means no engineering, no advanced research, no scientific development, no firefighters, no police, no maintenance infrastructure or labour.

It's how places like Somalia end up as violent, stagnant shitholes. All the men fight, none of the men work.

**That's why ideas like ""monogamy"" and culturally-enforced fidelity came into existence in the first place.**

See, without regular access to sex, men spend a lot of their time in pursuit of it - only working as hard as they have to in order to win a female's attention, or fighting with other males over what few females are available.

But if you can convince your society of ideas like ""cheating is wrong"" and ""one man, one woman"", then you can guarantee that betas have a better shot at having a partner. Then, they can set aside their pursuits and their differences long enough to accomplish complex tasks that benefit the society as a whole.

Societies with aqueducts, penicillin, combustion engines, advanced armed forces, and a population of satisfied males surpass societies that don't have these things.

And it all starts with keeping your women in line."

Squat 3x5,
Split squats ,
Bench 
BB Row,
Chin ups,
Dips,
facepulls for shoulder health

other day:

Squat,
Deadlift,
OHP,
Chins,
Dips, 
hang cleans,
facepulls for shoulder health.

Obviously, everything needs to be done explosively and these lifts build strength.

3x5 on squats deads, ohp and bench. if they want, they can do two additional sets of 8. 3-4x8 on everything else

they just need compound lifts. keep it simple

goodguygaymer,AskReddit,1390417837.0,"&gt;Now, feminism enters 
the picture. It enacts a 
policy called “affirmative

“equality” for women. 
Instead of worrying 
about meeting the needs 
of society, the policy is 
focused on making sure 
everyone has access to 
each job, regardless of whether or not they’re qualified. 


&gt;As a result, five men lose their hunting jobs to five women. But 
because women lack the capacity to meet the demands of the hunting 
job, their output is very poor. Soon society suffers a food shortage. 


It seems like you make some rather blatant generalizations that are very anti-women, including references about how women vote the same way children do. Maybe I just saw the specific example and am taking it out of context.

Tuala08,AskMen,1390417841.0,"Well I felt this was an important question to ask, and frankly there is no way it state it more positively. I meant that I am not trying to be malicious and mean. I am simply trying to understand. Sure in some ways it is judgmental because whenever you make a decision about someone, positive or negative it's making a judgment. 
I did not mean that profiles had to be written to my expectations. This has noting to do with entitlement. As I tried to explain, it's just something I do not understand and would like some clarification about. No need to be mean about it. 

I agree dating is 2 way and I work hard to write interesting and indepth responses. But when someone has nothing on their profile, a picture of a car as their profile pic and writes 'hey' in the message, how am I supposed to come up with anything to say! I am just saying that I need a little something to work with. 
I did mean really offensive jokes. This was just an example of something really strange, but I have also gotten rape jokes etc.

Lol I know they are humans and make mistakes. I am not crazy. I am not talking about people who don't know how to use their cameras... I am talking about the people who don't even turn on a light and don't put on a clean shirt. 
Why did the car comment make you angry?  My point was I see two options 1. you really like cars or 2. you are trying to market to the superficial crowd.  If 1. you should talk about your passion in your profile, give some context, give something I can ask you a question about. if you are 2. then you should have a nice car, no?  I don't care about cars at all, I was just trying to understand this behaviour because some profiles will not mention a love of cars, just have a car as their profile pic as if I should be interested in them just for the car but it is not even a nice one.  It's just like if I try to pick up a guy based on my looks alone, surely I should make an effort to appeal to my target market?

GuiltyKitty,Thetruthishere,1390417851.0,"The story is interesting, so I took the liberty and made it actually readable:

So today, I felt the need to share my experiences with the so called “shadow hat man”. I have recently been talking to a friend about my encounters with him. I want to make clear that I googled the subject thoroughly before writing this and found that he seems to be a common experience people have – but my last experience with him is somewhat disturbing and I need to know what was going on then as nobody has written about this specific topic in any of the forums yet. Here are my encounters: 

1.) When I was about 5-6 years old, I was in my room, listening to some childrens cassette (it was early in the morning, the sun had begun to rise so it wasn’t pitch black anymore but still very dark). I used to have this old desk, which was standing against a wall and had a built in shelf on top of it. On the shelf, was a lamp, with an elongated shade that threw a lengthy shadow against the wall. Now, under the shadow of that lamp was the control for my heater in that room, a little device with a red and an orange light, those two were placed perfectly under that shadow of the lamp shade. 

So anyways, I remember being scared by some part of the children’s cassette and I looked up to the shadow on the wall and all of a sudden there he was, standing there, the lampshade had become his hat and the lights from the heating control his eyes. His body (the shadow) had gotten pitch black, darker than before, and he was moving a bit because HE WAS LAUGHING THE MOST EVIL LAUGH I HAVE HEARD IN MY LIFE. I am not shitting you. He laughed at me, and I screamed and ran to my parents. Nothing happened a long time after that, just a few other “paranormal” experiences I can’t quite explain – nothing involving him though. 

2.) About a year ago, I saw him again, this time in my own apartment in a different house. Now we’re talking about 18 yrs. later approx. I woke up in the middle of the night and he was standing, in my bedroom, a few feet away from me, watching me.  His appearance was the same as last time, but this time, no eyes (because of the missing heating control I guess). Big, dark, wide brim hat, no face and a trenchcoat closed up so it covers the lower half of his face. Typical description as it seems. He just stood there and all I thought was “oh it’s you again.” and in the next second he was gone and I went back to sleep. 

Now I have to make clear, that in my adult life, I have never been really afraid of him. The idea of him does not scare me. Just what he might do, but so far nothing had happened. Until about two weeks after that visit. And this is where this get’s so fucked up but I really have to get this off my chest. I remember, that I was half dreaming, half awake, I had seen him in my room again, watching me and then in my dream – things were sort of intertwining. It could not have been sleep paralysis as I was able to move! So he sort of…enters my dream, and…starts grabbing me, forcefully yet gentle and we…well...we end up…having intercourse…kind of…and it was pleasurable. He never talked, I couldn’t even hear him breathe, and it was very, very short as I probably moved around so much that I woke myself up. And then he was gone. 

I haven’t seen him since then. I somehow get the feeling this ‘man’ is after negative feelings, in general . Fear might be something he is looking for yet I have never felt it that much in his presence. Maybe he had not liked me enjoying what he did and he stopped because he would’ve hoped for me to scream in fear again. But I didn’t fear for my  life – nothing. So last week I had one of those inexplicable occurrences again, not linked to him, but I remembered what had happened and talked to a friend about it, I left out the last part though as I felt not comfortable telling her. And I sort of would like to know if he’s still there. 


Does anybody have any idea what this all could’ve meant? It seems people are afraid of him but not so with me. And above all I ask myself why he has “intruded” my dream like that back then. Does anybody have similar experiences? 

P.S.: I should mention that I had phases when I was younger, about 6 yrs ago, where I would halfway fall asleep and I would hear familiar and unfamiliar voices calling my name, in a questioning manner as if “are you still here? where are you?” in that sort of fashion. But only my name. 

P.P.S: I would appreciate if anyone could post some links concerning my problem.

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,xxfitness,1390417924.0,"Is this the first time you've started a fitness regime? If it is your first attempt, he gone a bit cray cray. If this is one attempt in many, your husband sounds like he is scared and that he has some trust issues when you say that you are going to follow through. It seems like his solution is to bully you through the hard beginning part in order to keep you going. 

If this is the case, I would sit and ask him why he doesn't believe you when you say you are committed to getting healthier. I would also take an honest look at your own actions to see why he might not believe your change. Then you can discuss how by going to the trainers you have made a commitment to getting fit, and by going to the gym on a regular basis you are showing that dedication it might make him feel more secure. If he's worried about you quitting he's going to freak out at any sign of you taking a rest. Sometimes just hearing you reaffirm your goals and that you are serious will help him chill out. It will also give you the space you need to have your ups and downs as you build a relationship with exercise.  

On top of that, I would take time for yourself to lay out what *your own goals* are. It sounds like your husband did a great thing by taking the reins and signing you up for trainers. Oftentimes we could all use a bit of a push to get us going. But after that it sounds like you are continuing more for him than yourself. Lay out what you want from working out (health, more energy, weight loss, learning to appreciate the amazing machine that is your body). This will help both of you because it will make *you* the leader of your own fitness journey. And if your husband understands you are invested and have very real reasons why you *will* achieve these goals he will be less scared of you ""falling off the wagon"" so to speak. 

Good luck! I myself have just started exercising and lifting from being almost completely sedentary due to a chronic pain disease. There will be ups and downs, but listen to Dory and just keep swimming. When your body starts doing what you want it to, it is an amazing and powerful feeling. "

mkvgtired,technology,1390417933.0,"Actually [several municipalities in the US have done this](http://i.imgur.com/2LiOok4.png). (Source: muninetworks.org). Chattanooga, TN was one of the first to offer gigabit speeds and now more municipalities are following suit. Local legislators from Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Ireland, Brazil, as well as from all over the US have come to Chattanooga to see how they did it. There are over 180 communities in the US with publicly owned fiber service to at least part of the metro area, and 40 communities with a publicly owned network that offers at least 1 Gb speeds. 

In addition to municipalities starting their own gigabit networks, [public private partnerships](http://gigabitsquared.com/) are expanding. The one linked will be installing gigabit networks in 6 cities within the next couple years. It is a coalition of universities who decided private providers are not innovating fast enough. There are other public/private coalitions like this. 

In addition to G^2 installing fiber on Chicago's south side, the city is pulling its own fiber as part of a sewer revitalization project to help offer lower cost of installing the fiber. So between both efforts, much of the city will have upgraded speeds. Other cities are pulling fiber as part of construction projects to help lower the cost of fiber installation as well.

**TL;DR: The first municipal networks in the US have beat this Canadian city by a decade. More and more municipalities are installing their own gigabit networks.**

bhaw,summonerschool,1390417961.0,"&gt;To achieve this, we keep focusing on ways to be aggressive and try to kill them, ...

Being aggressive is the correct way to deny cs. In low elo, however, your opponents often won't realize when they're at a disadvantage and will go for CS anyway. Because of this fact, your goal in low elo shouldn't be to get more cs than your opponent, it should be to farm kills on them.

&gt;...but that is often too dangerous and can have the opposite result of our intentions.

Don't get discouraged. Every time you die or lose a trade, identify what caused it to happen. Did your opponents have an item or creep advantage? Did you miss a skillshot? Did you engage with important skills on cooldown? Was your lane partner too far away to help with a trade? Did you extend too far without appropriate wards/knowledge of the enemy jungler? By understanding why you lost the engagement, you will be able to prevent the same mistake from occurring in the future. Every lost trade/death makes you a better player. This same train of thought should occur when you win a trade, as well.

Your goal is to know the outcome of a potential trade before you make it. Then, you will be able to pick only winning engagements."
funkymunniez,Patriots,1390417961.0,"No, I'd rather spend the money on a CB or Safety that can stay healthy into the playoffs.  Talib seems to be the type of player who ends up just breaking, much like Amandola, and can't end up playing all 16 games.  And his recurring hip felxor injury is worrying to say the least that he'll break again when the playoffs come, and we just won't be able to hold up with the rest of the cast the Pats have.

Oh and lets not forget, is it going to be worth it to resign Talib with all the Free Agents that are going to be coming up after the 2014 season? Mallet, Bolden, Devlin, Ridley, Vereen, Slater, DJ Williams, Connolly, Solder, Zusevics, Kelly, Siliga, Wilfork, Chris White, Steve Gregory, McCourty, Adrian Wilson, Gostkowski

Free Agents this coming season: Edlelman, Talib, Blount, Collie, Hooman, Mulligan, Svitnek, Wendell, Carter, Spikes, Fletcher, Aiken

Lot of bigger Patriot names on that list.  So is it worth it to put up some big money on Talib with no guarantee he will play 16+ games and have to let go some of those guys?  I don't think so."

Since what you are advocating for will likely require either hormone-altering drugs or a surgical procedure, and since you are the one that is pushing the issue, you might want to be prepared to pay more than half. You might want to be prepared to pay for the entire cost.

In response to the OP in general, it is your prerogative to have whatever standards you feel are right in a relationship. Just understand that these standards will limit who you can be with, as those you're with often may not share these standards, so it's better to talk about these hard standards early into a relationship."

You suddenly have a 4ft cock. Now what? (NoName, I know it's tough to think that small, just play along. :P)

If you had to choose between sleeping with your mom, or the corpse of Steve Irwin, which would you choose? Just for laughs, let's  say if you pick your mom, she'll be completely infatuated with your cock from that moment on, and turns into a you-obsessed sexual predator. Have fun!

It's fine with me if people take their interests somewhere because they disagree with our rules. Our rules are not in place for no reason. They also have very little to do with incest, but more to enforce the reddit TOS and keep us from getting banned. We don't have a rule saying, ""No mom/son stories,"" or ""No gay stories,"" because we want people to be able to post their content. It's when it borders on child grooming or non-consent or blackmail that we step in and remove the post.

Tacking onto that, our rules have cut down on a lot of the pedo-erotica, and trolls. There's a reason we have rules, ALL subreddits have rules. We're not excluded from that just because we cater to a certain fantasy. The majority of websites have rules. 

Again, my post had nothing to do with rules but more of an information thing, so I'm not sure why you brought it up in the first place."

If rubbed lightly with only small pressure increases as I am getting closer to orgasm I still feel the sensation I'm going to pee but that is when, if I/or my hubby keep going, I'll have an orgasm and sometimes (but not all) squirt some too. It definitely isn't pee.

olov244,AskReddit,1390418458.0,"(warning: a little sad)i used to go running with a friend around a small lake, it was just over 3 miles. she had just gotten off work, we ran our loop, and walking back to the cars she heard an animal in the woods. it sounded like just some random bird squawking to me, but she swore it was a hurt animal.

so she takes off into the woods(i couldn't let her go alone so i follow), it quickly turns to swamp, she takes her shoes off, i keep mine on. before you know it we're both up to our waist in swamp. side note, this lake has alligators in it, we're close to the NC coast, also snakes, etc. so she sees it's a baby raccoon on like an island with his foot stuck in something. we figure it's some litter/etc. so i go looking for some sticks to help it without getting bitten. everything i touch is soaked and breaks. i finally find two decent sticks and then see an adult raccoon coming straight at me, i freeze(baby raccoon is still yelling, and i'm up to my waist in swamp). the adult raccoon stops and looks at me, then takes a wide loop around me, looks at my friend, then carries on it's way. i get back to my friend, and give her one of the sticks, we try and lift the raccoon out of the water to see what has it's foot stuck. we fight and fight and all of the sudden, a snapping turtle head pops up with the baby raccoon's foot in it's mouth. we tried poking it's head, legs, lifting it up(it was probably close to 3ft from side to side), everything, the more we fought, the more it fought. the raccoon was trying to bit it's own foot off to get free. the little island the raccoon was on was basically just floating weeds and he was slowly going down.

it had to be over an hour into it, and we finally had to give up. i knew we weren't going to win, and i told my friend we'd get out and call animal control or something to get her to leave(or she would have stayed till it drowned).  we get out of the woods and the squealing stops.... she breaks down crying, we sit on the edge of the woods for a while, then hose off outside her office. she calls me and we talk for her 30 min drive home and for the next few hours(she was scared and didnt' want to keep thinking about what just happened) till her gf gets home from work. she's got the biggest heart of anyone i've ever seen, if i ever get married she's gonna be my best woman

she had no idea turtles could do that, or get that big either"

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390418461.0,"Yeah, it's definitely strange, but maybe people do it just in case there happens to be a perfect fit.  For example, it's not a preference, but I think people with red hair and green eyes are especially attractive compared to the same look with any other combo - so maybe I'd look for them as a ""get lucky"" type of thing, but honestly, I really don't care either way.  This might be a terrible way to put it, but it would be like asking a dealership what cars have an actual electrical outlet - I can't imagine ever needing it, and it really doesn't matter, but if the feature is there and I like the car, then why not?  I'm sure there are far better examples, but that's all I got right now.

And some of those questions really are terrible.  ""What do you find more attractive, passion or intelligence?""  Uh, what?  That's a horrible question, and I'm not answering.  But there are some that I do like - for example, ""what's bigger - the sun or the moon?""  If they pick ""the moon,"" we have a potential problem.  That will cause me to check the rest of the profile to see if she really doesn't know or if it's just a joke, so that helps.  Also, things like ""has cats"" (I'm allergic) or ""smokes"" are immediate dealbreakers, and I don't have to waste my time.

Honestly, I'm really just that good.  My first couple days on the site, I made a bunch of mistakes - I read a bit about how the matching works, thought about everything, and then created a method that I thought would be optimal.  It's a bit formulaic, which may be offputting for something like this, but to me, it's necessary.  It also worked incredibly well, and is in no way manipulative or anything like that (like the PUA stuff), so I have no problem using it.  Most people tend to be impressed by it, and actually, that's why I was recruited to make my friend's profile."

Niedermeyer90,investing,1390418467.0,"I agree, but I think everyone sees that coming...and don't you think that's already priced into its current trading multiple discount relative to its peers? If people though Apple was on a high growth trajectory the stock would be priced wildly different. But relative to its competition, it's cheap by all metrics, especially after its recent successful expansion into China with cheaper iPhones (also $200 and less). 

Plus considerable technical support at $525, if that's your bag, the fact that every major bank has issued $600+ price targets on the equity, and other blah blah reasons people tout about why Apple is cheap / a good value.

My perspective right now is neither to panic nor to buy aggressively; I think investors in Apple just need to **chill** and resist the urge to make a hasty decision. It's a great company in a bit of a transition period as it has become one of the more mature companies in the field. But it trades at a very fair value right now, and if you invested a while back with a low cost basis (mine is less than $400/share), you need to wait for a few macro and company-specific trends to play out before you jump to a decision.

Borror0,Quebec,1390418476.0,"Je suis en faveur d'un revenu minimal garanti, aussi. C'est le morceau d'information qui te manquait pour mieux comprendre ma position et ne pas penser que je suis littéralement Stephen Harper, mais celui-ci le remplissait pas le critère nécessaire pour être inclus dans l'énumération (c'est-à-dire, ne coûter rien).

Je considère le salaire minimum comme étant un outil inefficace et inefficient pour réduire le taux de pauvreté. [Les études sur l'efficacité de salaire minimum au Canada](http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/02/19/want-to-help-the-poor-dont-waste-your-time-with-the-minimum-wage/) ne sont pas favorables, surtout lorsqu'on ajoute l'effet de celui-ci sur le taux de chômage. La plupart des travailleurs au salaire minimum sont jeunes et font partis d'un ménage qui n'est pas à faible revenu. Pendant ce temps, le prix planché empêche certains travailleurs de se trouver un emploi. Bref, c'est inefficace et inefficient. On crée du chômage et on redistribue maladroitement.  

Ceci n'est pas de devrait pas être surprenant. Le salaire minimum est une solution de prix s’attaquant à un problème de revenu. L’issue n'est pas que le salaire de certains individus est trop bas. Le marché fait bien sa job, sur ce front. Le salaire représente réellement la valeur de leur contribution. Le problème c'est que le revenu final n'est pas assez haut. 

Pour cette raison, le salaire de ces personnes doit être bonifié par l'État. Malheureusement, le bien-être ne fait pas la job correctement, en parti parce qu'il est trop difficile d'y accéder (paperasse, bureaucratie, etc.) et en parti parce qu'il est trop difficile d'en sortir à cause de taux d'imposition marginal effectif trop élevé. Une personne sur le bien-être n'a pas d'incitatif à gagner plus de $200 par mois. Après ce montant, chaque dollar gagné est compensé par une perte équivalente de bénéfice. 

Un revenu minimal garanti permettrait de régler ces deux problèmes, en intégrant l'aide sociale dans la fiscalité. On pourra ainsi fixé taux d'imposition marginal effectif plus raisonnable, en diminuant la vitesse à laquelle on réduit les bénéfices. 

Réduire le taux de pauvreté au Québec est parmi les raisons les plus importantes que je m'implique en politique, prenant seconde place seulement à un traitement plus adéquat des personnes souffrant de santé mentale. Par contre, comme on le dit souvent, il faut créer la richesse avant de la redistribuer. C'est dans ce cadre qu'il faut analyser mes positions. Il faut prendre les solutions les plus efficientes pour améliorer notre économie ainsi que les solutions les plus efficientes pour combattre la pauvreté. 

Parfois, une solution à un problème va avoir une impacte négatif sur un autre problème. Un revenu minimal garanti, par exemple, comporte un certain incitatif à ne pas travailler, ce qui est mauvais pour l'économie. Pareillement, hausser la TVQ est régressif. L'important, dans tout ça est la somme, le résultat final. Il n'y a pas de panacée. Tout traitement a des effets secondaires. L'important est donc que les effets secondaires soient moins pire que l'alternative. "

I am literally speechless at the idea that someone, somewhere, thinks this is the appropriate course of action.

It makes no mention to the displacement they cause, the police presence they bring with them and the large class of people working to support their out-of-touch and extravagant lifestyles: the tech support.

Wait, is this person claiming that increased police presence and working-class jobs are negative influences of tech employees?

Uh huh. And all my other points about the various definitions and burdens that have to be hashed out, likely in litigation with the companies who are seeking to remain labeled ""GMO-free""? The point is that both situations will experience litigation, and passing or not passing the law will still leave the lawyers richer."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390418590.0,"&gt; Got your address, etc.?

Part of the same groups of people, present at the same events. Probably could find my address if they were determined to, but that doesn't matter as much as actually interacting in person.

&gt;That's not the basis of control. The basis of control is through the attempt you are making in this conversation. You aren't trying to control these men directly.

I'm trying to contribute to changing OP's view. Which is the point of the subreddit. I am not trying to control or change the behavior of men in general.

&gt; They can place a scenario in your head for what, like 10 seconds before you can forget it? Also, in that scenario, you're most likely already interested. It's probably not a rape fantasy.

Part of the problem is their assumption that I am already interested in the scenario they paint. 

And if it *were* actually a rape fantasy they unfolded for me, that would actually be more okay *for me specifically on fetlife* because that is something I am into. 

&gt; Are you saying that anyone who offers unsolicited sex talk on the internet is a potential rapist? I don't think there's even a modicum of indication that that's true. You seem to have a sexist paranoia.

I am not at all saying that. 

I think what I said to /u/ZippityZoppity is what I'm getting at:

However, the red flags that are raised by this behavior are the same red flags that are raised by unsettling behavior done in person.

So it is difficult, and unwise, to try to numb oneself to the red flags themselves.

Some people, no doubt, have the ability to segregate these situations. To ""only be upset by this behavior when done in person and threat is clear"" and not ""when done from a distance and immediate threat is unlikely.""

And probably, the longer we interact online, the more used to this type of segregation we will become.

But most of us aren't there yet, if we have the ability to get there.

And I can't recommend learning to overlook the behavior itself. That can get dangerous."
FactualPedanticReply,AdviceAnimals,1390418591.0,"Some are poorly-made and difficult to clean, but others (the higher-end models especially) are better. Some even open along their length for easy cleaning. If you're going to be masturbating and cumming anyway, you're going to have to clean cum off something, somewhere; keeping it all in one dedicated spot is arguably better. 

Also, dildos do get gross if you don't clean them between each use. Just a hot water rinse with a little soap is all they need if it's going back into the same vagina it was just in. If it's going between users, or between the anus and anywhere else on one user, disinfection by boiling is highly recommended - or just put it in the dishwasher!

superior22,summonerschool,1390418670.0,"Two important things, doesn't matter if Bronze, Gold or Challenger. Always pressure something and vision!

You always want to pressure something. You've destroyed your opponents tower and gained an advantage for your team. Now pressure something else. Take their buffs if they're up, go for dragon, rotate over to another lane and help them take another tower. All of these things will push your advantage further.

Now comes the vision thing. You never want to be in a spot where you don't know where your opponents are. It doesn't help your team at all if you push up to the second tower and get dove on by three opponents. You didn't apply pressure, you gifted them gold to come back. If you watch some high elo streams you'll notice relatively early that they always push a wave past the river and then go to another lane. Most likely you don't have vision past the river so you don't want to walk further. The enemy might wait for you. If you took a tower and / or killed your opponents go into their territory and put some wards down. Since they're dead they're obviously not there. You've got some free time to gain vision. If you know where your opponents are, they can't catch you out. Most lower division games are thrown because people walk around in areas they don't have vision on."
Miliean,AskMen,1390418673.0,"&gt; objectively insensitive position 

Well, it is but that's only because of the limited availability of BC for men compared to women. 

You dislike condoms, and that's fine, lots of people do.  You refuse to do a relationship where condoms are a long term requirement, that's fine as well.  The problem is that the only other available option is for the women half of the relationship to take on an additional burden of alternate form of BC.  It's that last bit that most people take issue with.

It's basically forcing someone else to take action to fit your own preference.  Personally, I agree with you.  Condoms harm the feeling of sex enough that if there were no other birth control options available I would consider not perusing a relationship with that person. 

It's one of the main reasons I support a male pill (among so many good reasons).  It allows the man to make a choice like this without it being considered an ""insensitive position"" because of the limitations on birth control technology. "

*""You must have looked up these facts and thought of these arguments ahead of time because you were anti-women to begin with.""*

A big part of the problem is that many feminist beliefs such as the pay gap are already mainstream and most people have heard of it. Nuanced information used to counter it take a lot more reading/digging into. People get the impression that you're trying too hard and must have had an agenda against women.

It becomes as though being informed and legitimately concerned about intellectual honesty makes you an ""Angry Bitter Man"". It's thematically similar in some ways to the Angry Black Man/Woman stereotype used to discredit certain people. Focusing more on the messenger and how angry/emotional he must be or how he must be insecure or have an agenda; focusing less on the message.

I learned and gave up this approach quickly IRL (since I'm not protected by anonymity). Instead, now I feign ignorance and ask for evidence when people try to persuade me with misinformation/disinformation. Because it's much more acceptable to be stupid and ignorant.

PinkiePai,AskReddit,1390418912.0,"Feeling kinda crappy. I was depressed as hell and hating on myself, then I got fuckign drunk as hell. 

Came out to my girlfriend as MtF transgender on 1/10/14, so 12 days ago. 

Things were okay at first, but she's been feeling anxious and worried because she's not sure how she feels about this shit yet. I don't blame her one bit, I love her to death. I understand. But it doesn't help me any. I feel like a complete piece of shit for even telling her about any of this shit because all it's done is upset her and make her feel like anxious, worried, and upset. 

She had no idea that I would have ever been bi, let alone transgender, so naturally it hit her like a fucking train. 

I thought she would be a lot stronger than this, at least just for me. We've been together about 3 years now, I'm 21 and so is she. 

At this point I just wish I could fucking disappear so I wouldn't hurt the people I love for wanting to live my life the way I've always wanted to. Suicidal thoughts are a daily, constant occurrence. Fuck, the only reason I didn't fucking blow my brains out when I was 14 was because I didn't want to do that to my parents, to have them deal with that emotional trauma. But here I am now, going through the same dilemma once again. 

I feel like I'm just going to end up being nothing in life. I can't decide what I want to go to school for so much that I'd indebt myself for all eternity. I can't make enough money to ever afford anything but subsistence living, ala paycheck to paycheck. All the normal life shit plus struggling, wrestling with gender identity. 

It all makes me want to jump off the fucking bridge, I don't want to deal with this shit. The moments leading up to death are scary, but the act of actually going out is generally peaceful. It's like sleep. I'm so fucking tired, all I want to do is take that final sleep. 

I'm seeing a therapist but it doesn't fucking help me much. Even if I decided RIGHT NOW that I was going to transition, I don't know how the fuck I could afford it. I can barely afford feeding myself and keeping the heat on. 

Don't go calling the cops on me reddit, I'm drunk and probably just going to play video games and cry myself to sleep. This is my daily routine.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390419144.0,"Well, the only reason you can't OD on nicotine is because it's only given in ridiculously small amounts.  It could have been some DARE scare tactic bullshit (or biology, can't remember), but I remember learning at some point that 1 drop of nicotine is enough to kill you.  Cigarettes only have trace amounts because of that.  The fact that it's controlled doesn't make it any less hard of a drug.  What if people were only able to smoke meth or take cocaine in such small amount for that to get nothing but slightly buzzed?  Would they still be hard?  ODing is ODing, and just because it's hard to get enough to do it, doesn't mean the drug isn't harmful.

And I don't think death is really what makes a drug hard either.  You don't have to die from alcohol poisoning, but just to have it in general is bad enough.  And it's easy to do - you drink enough to get to the point that you can't remember anything, and then you drink some more because you aren't functioning enough to know any better.

And about LSD:

&gt;In most cases, the psychosis-like reaction is of short duration, but in other cases it may be chronic. It is difficult to determine whether LSD itself induces these reactions or if it triggers latent conditions that would have manifested themselves otherwise. The similarities of time course and outcomes between putatively LSD-precipitated and other psychoses suggest that the two types of syndromes are not different and that LSD may have been a nonspecific trigger

Plus, you'd have to probably take quite a lot to have long lasting effects, and I'm not even sure if that's true.  But for what it's worth, I've had a bad trip, and I almost don't like calling it that because it was still an amazing experience."

ljak,philosophy,1390419157.0,"I think that this was strongly implied in the Matrix trilogy, specifically in Matrix Reloaded, in which supernatural events (miracles) are observed in the supposedly ""real"" world.

In Lacanian terms, the Real exists beyond the symbolic, whereas the world into which Morpheus pulls Neo still operates according to a symbolic order. Perhaps Neo's sacrifice at the end of the trilogy represents him finally experiencing the Real, but the viewer only sees it from the symbolic perspective. Perhaps if the Wachowskis tried to show that scene from Neo's perspective, it would look like a [snow crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Crash)."

Now if the kids were...absolutely insane?  Like, kick the cat, screaming, spitting on strangers, breaks everything they touch even at the age of 10 insane: that's going to push me away.  I certainly wouldn't be friends with everyone who had kids, but I also wouldn't be friends without everyone who didn't have kids either.

DaEvil1,nintendo,1390419508.0,"Judging from what Nintendo has shared in terms of development on the previous consoles coupled with leaks which have turned out to be true, the progress on their console should be something like this:

- Nintendo is hard into development of their next console. They start developing a new console well before the release of the current console. Couple this with the weak performance of the Wii U, and that development may have been boosted even more forward than usual because they'll want to have a contingency ready if things keep looking bleak for the Wii U. 

- At this point they will be somwehere between having decided on the controller to have the control prototype ready along with concepts for utilization of the controller.

- The hardware specs wont be finished at this point, and will be flexible to a certain extent, but they will already have a clear price range in mind.

- The current concept for the console will quite possibly be a concept they've had in mind for a long time but haven't been feasibly until recently. If the leak about the name here is to be believed, it would point to their handheld efforts and console efforts be united to some extent, most likely in terms of using a 3DS and/or a potential successor as a controller for the next home console."

If you're going to make a decently-sized comment about what this study lacks based on a single chart, you should at least check more than the first couple comments for an OP link.

Note, I'm not saying I expect *everyone* reading this thread to do that - just those that leave sizeable comments critiquing a study they haven't read.

Also, I stand by my assertion that the graph standing by itself isn't terribly misleading. When you look at the complete data, there *aren't* any deathstar drives, there aren't any particularly weighty outliers, and the bottom seven drives were all Seagate...it's a pretty accurate picture of the wide range of models they tested.

Neither I or the authors are saying that Seagate is utter shit and should never be purchased - on the contrary, they own 12,000 of them, even after testing them.  There's a price/failure tradeoff, and they're generally happy with all of the drives they have.  I think their perspective is that Seagate is just less great than the rest of them."

The main one I noticed about a bunch of sheltered upper-class white kids who try to ""live it hard"" is how fucked up their ability to empathize is. 

There's a difference between how they became ""cold"" for lack of a better term, and people who really had it hard and become cold, and I've known, lived with, and fought both.  people who grew up hard have to do it because they either had to, or think they had to survive.  It's a stone faced cold that is almost all business, or all rage.  Uppers, they on the other hand turn cold because they want to.  They do it by beating the shit out of siblings, killing animals, burning down forests, etc.  Something in them want's to turn to that dark, and I think it is 10 times scarier.

Scarcer,microgrowery,1390419703.0,"Sounds like you may be getting ""damping-off"", which is a fungal infection that especially attacks the stem of rooting clones.

It may be a damp-off infection attacking your two plants. It's possible you have too much moisture, you don't want your plant so wet that it's as if they are constantly submerged up to the stem, just wet enough that the plant doesn't starve and dry out, so observe that.

Is there a tiny bit of slime where the infection is happening?

More importantly, go to your local grow shop right now and get some organic fungicidal soap that includes copper, and spray it on the plant ASAP. Try to keep the stem dry for the next few days.

**Tip:** Hydroton isn't a very good growing medium as it has no weight to anchor the plants down with. (This is especially the case in flood to drain systems.) If I were you I'd switch to another medium such as lavarock. Hydroton can be layed on top to prevent moisture loss and block light."

I send you a giant virtual hug! (if you want it).

The kind of strength that it takes to do what you have so far done is very, very impressive, and I am in awe of it.

I hear how much damage you've taken, I hear how much it has caused you to doubt yourself.

I hope these steps you've taken can feel like the foundation on which you'll build yourself back up.

You are a wonderful man, for doing this for yourself, for doing this for your kids, for sharing with others.

I hope you are able to find people who have been through this and truly know what you are going through.

Whatever horrible things she made you feel and think about yourself, there are just as many good, strong things inside you.

You just did something few people will ever have to do, and probably not many could. You were able to pull off this amazing feat even from a position of heartbroken self doubt. Incredible.

If you can do this, you can handle whatever comes next. 

Keep taking time, as often as you need it, to replenish your resources. Your body needs food, sleep, laughter, touch.

I am keeping you in my thoughts. I send the warmest wishes I have your way."

planejane,AskMen,1390419862.0,"I'm another success story, although it's not for everyone. I had gone off hormonal BC for a few months after a break-up, and was surprised how much I liked not being on hormones (I'd been on the pill for 4+ years). That might be part of /u/missmisanthropy 's problem, if she didn't go off hormonal bc for a while first. I had similar issues when I went OFF the pill (weight gain, then loss, acne, mood swings, etc.) but it all subsided a few months before I got an IUD. If anything, my mood swings are less without hormones than they ever were when I was on the pill. 

I had it put in and it was rough for about 3-4 months-horrible, massively heavy periods, cramping like I'd imagine labor feels like, etc--but after a bit it all subsided. It's still heavier than it was before my IUD, but it's manageable. 

The only part I strongly dislike in her comment is that the copper f*'s your biological chemistry. No moreso than a piercing. Hormones mess with SO many different systems. Maybe it's beneficial for her, nobody's wired exactly the same, but to imply that the copper has MORE of a biological impact than hormonal BC is laughable."

2: No-Fap is a spiritual, inner experience, as well as a physical, outward one. No-Fap allows you the opportunity to challenge yourself, while improving yourself, gaining confidence and newfound skills along the way. Taking a drug to do this, is more or less, like taking steroids in sports. Sure it would help, but it takes away from the true meaning of the game, of trying to get better yourself, and opens up health issues that can be devastating.

&gt;The lower receiver is the engine of the firearm

No, I'm pretty sure the Bolt and chamber are the engine, the receiver is more akin to the frame.

&gt;30 bullets, half a second

Talking about (and incorrect) firerate as a downside. What anti-gunners don't realize is that automatic fire is not what people use, and they wouldn't use. Semi-auto is and always will be king for fast and accurate target acquisition. Sure at a range for S&amp;Gs I would dump a mag full auto, **once**, to see what it's like. Automatic is not for hitting targets, but for suppressing them.

&gt;high powered assault weapon, sniper version

lol, congrats, you found an AR with a scope and bipod

&gt;this is the engine of the semi automatic. Without it, it doesn't function

It doesn't function without the barrel either, or the bolt. Or those damn tiny but powerful springs in the trigger group. Why is the receiver being thrown under the bus? Ban the trigger springs!!!!

&gt;talking about the 3d printed gun as if it is as bad if not worse than the ARs

Seriously, it shot like one or two 22lr before failing. And I'm pretty sure it is manual action.

Closing thoughts:

People have been able to make guns at home for a long time before 3D printing. And I'm not talking about your 12Ga zip gun. Ak-47s have been made out of plumbing pipes in the middle east. Stamped out, blowback operated rifles like the sten gun are very simple to copy. Plus AR-15s aren't the problem.

The other problem people don't factor in is the cost of phones, virgin customers have to pay full price for their phones because they are non-contract plans, the reason you can get an iPhone for like 99 at atnt is that they subsidize the cost in exchange for the promise of getting your business for 2 years. 

Basically, if you don't have 500+ dollars to pay up front you are caught in this cycle of either not getting a smart phone or getting a fairly priced one but being stuck with an overpriced 2 year contract.

CaliBuddz,atheism,1390420369.0,"God damnit. I hate things like this, so allow me to try and help. To begin with morality evolved alongside society. Morals began small. Dont kill people for example. Because it was not advantageous to not kill other people. Morality allows us to live together in harmony and is continually evolving as society progresses. This is because as new generations get used to new morals ""outlawing slavery, equal rights, etc"" they become the norm and now this generation can deal with other things that are problems and can help society function better. This has been happening since ancient times and with the advent of language it has only continued to evolve and has been allowed to fully take form in progressive movements. Morals are just there to help facilitate society. The bible is a perfect example of antiquadated morals. It is filled with things that would have helped society ""at the time"". Granted some things in it still hold true, but that is because those traits are some of the basic building blocks that have become the norm. 

As others have said, morals are very objective and no two people will have the same values. But in the end morals are the glue that holds society together. Something is considered ""bad, immoral, or evil"" if it disrupts the flow of society. We dont need an almighty ghostly creator to tell us not to kill people. We can fucking figure out by ourselves that it is bad to kill others because then they can no longer help society. Same with slavery. It was good at the time (not saying slavery is good, just that it was a fundamental building block of many countries and cultures), but as society got more advanced those peoples would be better off not getting treated like mindless workers and being able to help society in their own way. This is because everyone (while out for themselves in the end) needs to make a living. And the only way to make a living legitamately in society is to offer a service.  The same can be seen in womens rights. In america women gained their rights after two massive consecutive wars where they worked hard (while the men were away) and proved that they could add a massive positive economic benefit to the country. We realized that half of the countries most intelligent people were wasting away and accordingly society changed. 

We are not as high and mighty as many people like to think. In the end we are animals that have animalistic needs. Morals are an evolutionary trait that help to ensure survival. That is all. The perfect example are prides of lions. Why doesnt the strongest lion just fucking eat the others so there would be less competition? Because then he would be losing value and potential gains. We can go in depth about really specific morals but many are just by products of the advent of conscience thought and language combined with basic evolutionary moral traits. 

To sum up. Morals are an evolutionary trait that allows us to maximise efficiency in society. They evolve over time and compound on each other as new generations become used to new and previously ""progressive and groundbreaking"" morals. Add that to the fact that humans like to bitch about things we have a problem with and it is clear to see that morality is basically a compounding of thousands of years of advancing beneficial thoughts that have their roots in basic animalistic survival traits.

They are without a doubt the most comfortable and most stylish shoes that I own. I have received many compliments from both men and women when wearing them. Sometimes I tuck my jeans into them, sometimes I don't. They are so fucking warm and so fucking comfortable, especially when I take my socks off. What makes them so comfy is that there is sheep's wool on the sole, so it actually forms around your feet after time.

And for all of you that think that I'm gay. First off, I'm as straight as my dick is hard when I fuck my fiancee. Secondly, a little known fact about Uggs is that they were originally made for men. Here's the history:

Uggs were created in the 1950s for Australian male surfers who wanted their feet to be warm, as well as comfy, when they came in from the surf. Visitors from Europe saw the shoes and brought the trend to Europe, where women from America brought that trend to the states.

I paid $155 before tax for them. They are regular sized Ugg boots (not super short, but not the super tall ones) and they are brown."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390420452.0,"While that is *very* true, it is not as simple as thinking of it as ""generalizing online interactions to real-world ones.""

This is an instinctual reaction/response.

I really do think that, through repetition and experience, it can be contextually modified. 

But thinking about this fear/threat response as an over reaction very well could place doubt across the board.

It needs to be handled in a way that the response itself isn't diminished or doubted, and is still present when it needs to be, in person. 

So not:

""This type of advance is harmless, few guys are bad, chances are his motives are good, this is an overreaction"" 

but:

""Something about this doesn't feel right."" *check context*
""okay, don't have to determine his intention, because he is not here""

On the other hand,  if they are lasting more than a few days, or are more than mild they could indicate something more serious.  


2. Usually fermented foods / yogurt / probiotics are suggested, but IIRC colonoscopy shouldn't have that adverse of an affect on your gut flora.  If you aren't making your own yogurt you may be having additional complications if the yogurt has any remaining lactose (if you don't tolerate it well) and IIRC many commercial yogurts do.  

Never tried a probiotic enema before.  Might be something to discuss with your doctor.  "

soxandpatriots1,technology,1390420517.0,"In the United States, college and university are often interchangeable in casual conversation, especially when discussing undergraduate studies. The main difference is that a college is usually smaller, focuses on undergraduate studies, and gives out only Bachelors degrees, while a University is usually larger and has graduate programs with more research going on, and they award Masters and PhDs in addition to Bachelors. 

You may also hear Universities refer to the colleges within that larger University, so a large university may have a college of business, a college of engineering, etc. In the United States, we also have community colleges, which seem in line with your idea of a college. Community colleges are usually two-year institutions that offer diplomas, certifications, and Associate's degrees.

So right now, I'm attending college in the United States. I am in my 4th year and will receive a Bachelor's degree, just like I would at a University. However, if I want to do additional schooling and receive a Master's or PhD, I would have to apply to a larger university that has graduate programs in the field that I want.

Some names can be misleading, such as Boston College, which is called a college, but has lots of graduate and research programs. Usually though, colleges and university adhere to the general criteria I discussed earlier. "

Not intelligent

Emotional basketcase

Not conventionally attractive"
soitcause,changemyview,1390420531.0,"&gt;Anonymity over the internet is not, and should not, be treated as a social ""letting loose"".

Except that's how it *is* treated. Whether or not it should be that way is irrelevant if all you're trying to do is go about your business on the internet. People in general are assholes when anonymous. This isn't limited to harassing women on dating sites; anyone that's played an online game for any period of time can tell you that it's impossible to keep track of the number of times they've been called a faggot or how their mom's a whore, or how they're mentally deficient to the point of it being a miracle they can move their mouse. It's kinda strange to me that, given this extremely widespread pattern of behavior, people are still **shocked** when they're on the receiving end of it.

&gt;but there's a difference between saying, ""hey, I don't want to bullshit around this, I'm interested in casual sex and you're really attractive"" and saying ""hey you have really hot tits and a nice ass, I really want to stick my dick in that shit"". One's frank, the other is objectification.

They've both objectification; one's just more explicit than the other. The first guy is still telling you that he wants sex and you're attractive, therefore his message. Your attractiveness is the only thing being evaluated.

As for your first point, why shouldn't that be the first thing they bring up? If it's something that's important to both of you, then it's valid as a point of discussion. If he's more interested in figuring out sexual compatibility because he tends to get along with most people then of course sex is going to be one of the first things he asks about. Granted, the ways in which this demographic chooses to do it are typically tactless and degrading, but it's expressing the same sentiment. 

&gt;I agree, which is what makes issues like this so tiring to me. I'm tired of having to explain why it's offensive to me that men are so aggressive on dating sites. But it happens.

I agree that in general it's a stupid discussion. That said, no really ever stops to question why men (not just these men) feel the need to be so aggressive in their online approaches. Or maybe people just don't care. Either way, it seems to me as if people just stop the discussion at ""Ick, this is offensive"" whilst there's room to actually shed some insight on the situation as a whole.

&gt;And not approaching someone due to fear of rejection/laziness/general disinterest in being an active participant in your own romantic life is not the same as** being aggressively approached in an unacceptable way**

That's a fine analysis, but you have to remember that that's from *you* perspective. A guy is not thinking his approach is aggressive to the point of being unacceptable. A guy may think that someone being lazy/unresponsive/whatever in lieu of his genuine efforts feels entitled because of the position society puts women in. Exactly how it feels may not be the same, but you can't discount someone's shitty experience just because you think it isn't equivalent.

I think there many parallels that could be drawn, but the larger point was that this kind of behavior isn't exclusive to this context. I admittedly why people are still so taken aback by it. Perhaps these are people who don't have much experience in these contexts, which is pretty understandable. My issue is more with the tirade that goes on among long term internet users who *know* that this isn't the only context in which this happens. That's misrepresenting the issue completely."

JohnTesh,conspiracy,1390420656.0,"I'm not saying everyone has shitloads of money, and I apologize if I gave that impression.

If you are asking for what the pattern looks like, many small businesses are bootstrapped on credit card debt and/or loans from friends and family often combining to less than $10,000 USD total. 

Some people get a second mortgage on their home, or use their home for loan collateral, but these are clearly not options for people who do not own a home.

The SBA gives small business loans with less of a collateral requirement, and there are often small, regionally targeted ethnic/geographic/demographic programs that award grants or small loans.

If you are so inclined, you could try to find angel or seed funds to invest in your new company, but this is typically only for people trying to build high growth companies with the intention of scaling, not a neighborhood restaurant or plumber or CPA.

Generally speaking, there is a combination of these things that can be used to get started, and to fund growth after startup but still in the early stages.

As for the best combination for someone with an iPhone and a bus pass, I do not know your skill set. If you are a lawyer or CPA, I would imagine you could get started for relatively cheaply with a computer and a few software/service subscriptions. If you are a developer, you can easily open a free heroku (or whatever) account and build a cloud based SaaS company for almost nothing, and scale it as you get customers. If you are an advanced materials engineer, I would imagine it would cost millions and millions to build your lab, and it will be practically impossible to fund that from nothing. There are plenty of things in between these examples, I was just picking different ends of the spectrum for discussion.

jianadaren1,buildapc,1390420693.0,"&gt;It therefore behooves one to get the most RAM per single card possible.

Not necessarily the most RAM possible, but rather the most RAM you're likely to need at a price you're willing to pay. Top-end current-gen games are pretty much all perfectly fine with 2GB at 1080p. I've only seen 2GB become a constraint at 4k with 4xAA and even then only on a handful of titles. And *even* then you can cut the AA (who needs it really at 4k?) and you're likely fine.

In short, 2GB is fine unless you have (or plan on getting) some serious monitors. If you're really worried go for 3GB, but more than that is just being paranoid."

ptam,AskReddit,1390420696.0,"Don't know why people are downvoting you. I understand why you feel that way. Functionally speaking, you only need one shoe for each kind of activity you'll engage in. But to others, the variety of shoes can do different things to complement different wardrobes, and they can behave more of an accessory than purely functional. I like to do what you say others do, spending lots of time finding the perfect shoes to fit my style and taste, as well as having comfort and the ability to endure the kind of work I know I'll put it through, because much of your physical comfort or discomfort is rooted in your feet, and what you're wearing can either gain immensly or look imcredibly disjointed when you wear the right or wrong shoe with it. I only end up buying one or two of each kind I used though. Two sneakers, one dress shoe, one pair of boots. Just so each sneaker fits well with either bluer tones or red tones in the rest of my outfit for the day."

Tuala08,AskMen,1390420705.0,"Whoops. I tried to phrase my question diplomatically and show that I really just interested in everyone's opinions, not in being mean, but apparently I did a poor job. 

1. Honestly, I would say that (well maybe not the scratching yourself part). Part of my issue with those words is that average and normal can have vastly different meanings. What does average mean to you? It's just really uninformative. I would try to say it in a fun way, like include some story about what you had to go through to get your car and that you are proud and passionate about it. This to me would be much more effective than a picture of a truck. That means nothing to me. If you talk about working hard to earn and save the money or carefully repairing an old truck, I think that is really cool. Or talk about your favourite kind of beer and why you came to that decision... by giving a story it gives me a sense that I know a bit about you and can see how you communicate and that maybe we would have fun talking.

2. I guess I disagree with the method of writing 100 'heys' to get one 'hey' back.  I think it's better to be more selective in who you write to and spend more time on them.  Sure it might seem like more work but if you write one genuine thought out message a day and get one reply is that really so much more work than writing a hundred short messages? And you are more likely to get a response from someone who is actually a good match for you because you have taken the time to write to someone for reasons other than they are a girl. If you look at online dating as just a faster way to get a hook up then 'hey' away, but if you are looking for a relationship I think one ought to ignore the 'numbers game' mentality. Pick a few people who seem worth it to you and invest the time in them.  What I would like in a message is just some proof you read my profile and you are writing to me for a reason.  Ask some question that can open conversation a bit better. It can be really simple like ""I see you like foreign languages, which ones do you speak?"".  If you think the person seems super awesome from their profile than I would go a bit more involved. I always carefully write a message and try to ask some fun questions while including a bit of information about myself. I just wrote to a guy who says he is a geologist. I said (among other things) ""I think it is so cool you are a geologist, I consider myself a hobby rock nerd.  I love going to Natural History Museums to see all the cool rocks and fossils"". He quickly wrote back and asked me what my favourite mineral was. I thought that was awesome and took some time to decide. I am super excited and impatient for him to write back!

Apparently the not having a good camera thing is more of a problem than I expected. I guess in this sense I have become a little snobby/spoiled in that I am usually surrounded by people who have the best of everything... ie most of the students in my university always have the newest iphone etc so I didn't really think consider that so many people would not have a good camera available.  I am also grateful to the people who responded here that explain most guys only have their picture taken when a girl forces them to! I have never thought about that.  Therefore, I vow to be less judgmental about the quality of someone's photo. However, if I was serious about finding someone and not wasting my time, I would look for someone who could take a decent enough photo of me. "

Since cutting out processed foods, I salt most my food now. To be sure, if you're eating a lot of processed foods, you're getting plenty. But too little salt can be harmful.

dsklerm,AskWomen,1390420846.0,"Any open ended question tends to work well with most people.  When I was younger I had a tendency to dominate conversations, not let people get words in edgewise etc.  I like listening.  Start basic show you're genuinely interested by asking follow up questions.  You don't want to pester, I try to keep my own anecdotes and opinions at a 1:2 ratio just because I know I end up rambling. But basic things like  How her days been, what she's doing this weekend, etc tend to genuinely get the ball rolling pretty well    This is good to because you'll be able to pick up pretty easily how interested they are in the conversation.  Short brief answers you might just be annoying her for example. 

As with any conversation eventually you get on something specific.  Keeping it open ended makes sure that it's something they feel comfortable talking about.  Whenever I hit a stall in conversation things like asking how people reacted or felt to the situation they were in, or if they would do whatever again, and why seem to work... But nothing is universal. 

These aren't tricks for talking to women, they're tricks for talking to people.  A lot of people like to talk about themselves, or through the proxies of their interests.  You can learn a lot about a person from a few well placed questions, but there isn't a flow chart or anything universal, ultimately both parties have to want to have the conversation.

About two months in, three of the damn junkies got together and decided to break my window, toss a firework stand smoke bomb in, and raid me, so I grabbed my illegally possessed Title II weapon (SBS) from under the bed, and proceeded to break the following laws:

* felony brandishing of a firearm
* discharge of a firearm within 50 feet of a residence
* possession of a firearm in relation to drug offenses
* possession of a firearm under the influence of a controlled substance
* possession of CDS with intent
* possession of CDS paraphernalia
* possession of CDS (seperate charge, because I liked smoking weed.)
* possession of a dirk knife in public
* assault with a deadly weapon
* discharge of a firearm with intent to kill

I have no idea if I hit the bastards, but they piled into their car and fucked off.  Left me with a broken window and a big dye stain on the carpet from the smoke bomb.

TyIzaeL,AskNetsec,1390420933.0,"Skimming, the article seems to make two points:  

1. Using an unpriviledged port (port &gt;1024) for SSH is bad.
2. Using something other than port 22 is annoying for users, whose applications all default to 22.

For #1, port 222 is &lt;1024, which classifies it as a privileged port, meaning a non-root process won't be able to use it, so this argument isn't applicable to using port 222.

For #2, it's a valid point, but users should be able to edit their ``ssh_config`` files under ``~/.ssh/config`` or they can be set globally by the admin in ``/etc/ssh/config``. Below is an example ``ssh_config`` file that uses port 222 instead of 22 for host ``www.example.net``. 

    Hostname www.example.net
    Port 222

Using a config file like this will allow programs like ``scp``, and ``rsync`` to automatically use the non-default port without any extra effort. For more info, try ``man ssh_config``."

ljak,philosophy,1390420975.0,"It's not a metaphor, but the purpose of the argument is to figure out the way that things really are, not to explain the fact that the universe exists. The latter is an entirely different topic.

One form of the argument goes like this:

If it is possible to simulate worlds, and we can conceive of reasons to simulate them, the odds of a given reality being simulated are very high because for every ""real"" reality there will be many simulated ones.

Or in the form of Bostrom's trilemma:

&gt; ""A technologically mature ""posthuman"" civilization would have enormous computing power. Based on this empirical fact, the simulation argument shows that at least one of the following propositions is true:

&gt; 1. The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;

&gt; 2. The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;

&gt; 3. The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.

&gt; If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one’s credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).

&gt; Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation.""

Sparkdog,BSG,1390421016.0,"I feel like some of the other comments here are missing your point.  The question as I see it is basically- if Cylons can broadcast everything about themselves back to the resurrection ship in order to download, why aren't they just broadcasting *all the time* so the rest of the Cylons always know everything that other Cylons in the field are doing at all times, instead of needing for someone to be killed and download in order to find out about something important going on.

The only answer I can come up with is this:  Resurrection technology was designed by the Final Five back on the first Earth.  The point of it was to attain a form of immortality.  It wasn't a robotic military asset.  Thinking of resurrection technology as something that should be a flawless and perfectly efficient system of data collection is off the mark.  It was a technology designed by ""people"", not a cold, calculating computer.  The ""Final Five"" of the first Earth lived in a free and peaceful society and wouldn't have designed a system where someone else could be remotely monitoring your whole life.  It was only a system for continuing on in a new body if you died.

To the other Cylon models, the ""imperfection"" of resurrection was just another custom of how their ""divine"" society operated.  They wouldn't even really consider trying to ""improve"" resurrection - that was just the way things worked."

I have no idea. _but you go on to claim that this absence of evidence means it (i.e. rape)didn't happen at all._ 
 
The thing is, you don't really know, or you have doubts. Now, if your point was to say that they might not have a case in court, I'd take this as a reasonable statement.

You could block out the majority of the last name, leaving only the first, middle, and second letter visible, as well as the first names of the parents on both certificates or again, the first, middle, and last letter of them to make sure they line up correctly.

Because asking a girl on a date is a standard interaction between men and women. Listen, this is what you do:

You, after class when she doesn't seem rushed, ""Hey, you seem really cool. I'd love to take you on a date sometime - can I give you my number?""

From there, she will either accept your number and text/call you and you can set up a date, or she won't and you've got your answer. For god's sake, avoid the basic mistake of inexperienced guys and don't ask her to ""hang out sometime"". Make it 100% clear you want to ask her on a *date* and go from there. "

It forces them to fight, because they've already been marked and will go to jail after this is over. At this point, the protesters must pull a coup d'etat and depose the current government to avoid being jailed en masse. This is really not in the best interests of the government.

Hanlon's Razor applies here; assume stupidity before malice. So we assume the Ukranian government is stupid before assuming that this was done as a false-flag operation by agents provocateur who represent parties with a vested interest in deposing the current government. They could be an ultra-radical wing of the political opposition. Or Russia. Or a NATO actor. Or who the fuck knows.

We don't even have cap room for all our own free agents, and I suspect we'd rather have Boldin and Whitner back than anyone available in free agency.  We'll add some bargain-basement veterans, but if we give out any contracts with an AAV over $1.5 million to anyone who wasn't on the team this past year, I'll be surprised.

In the draft... Watkins would be nice, but ultimately I think it would cost too much to move up and get him.  Its a very deep class, especially at WR, so we can probably get someone pretty good at 30, or give up a 3rd and get someone very good at 20, rather than giving up all our extra picks to chase after one particular player.

The revelation hit them, and since they were relatively intelligent females (I wouldn't hang out with stupid people anyway), their minds were changed, and they were okay with the fleshlight.

HaydenTheFox,gaming,1390421200.0,"The problem is just the overwhelming precision of the mouse. It's why many console FPSs include an auto-aim feature. Controllers are objectively less precise in a twitch-reflex situation than a mouse, and altering something in-game would, most likely, not change the gap.

Let's say you increase the MoA (how tight a spread of rounds a weapon has at range) of the weapons in the PC as compared to the console version, or make the first-shot recoil greater. Even the average PC player is going to have techniques to counteract that. Everyone knows how to avoid recoil, that's something that you pick up naturally. And most people know how to burst-fire to increase accuracy. It's hard to alter the game so that you eliminate enough of the gap.

Since you are using Exava, I would consider dropping Mogis's Marauders in favor of [Gore-House Chainwalker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=270796).  The Chainwalker is a common (currently selling for as little as nine cents each on TCGPlayer) in keeping with the budget theme.  I would also recommend adding some Rakdos Guildgates (currently at thirteen cents each) to shore up the mana base.  

Edit: Also, I see that there is a comment stating this on TappedOut, but 18 lands is not enough.  I recommend 23-24 lands for this deck."
apis_cerana,MorbidReality,1390421276.0,"Thanks. There will of some of the victims have already been translated (quite well, it seems) in that one link you posted -- but something that struck me in one of the papers is the short blurb about the victims' families going into the mountain to see the wreckage for themselves, to get closure.

Many of them had a hard time getting there, having to hike through treacherous terrain, and a few gave up. Some were stopped by the crew that were already there. The sister of one of the victims brought beer and peanuts (a favorite of her brother) to leave by the site, and the family of a victim came from Hong Kong and hiked to get there as well. I think this was mere days after the crash; I can't imagine what the families of the victims went through during this time. :("
ElderKingpin,malefashionadvice,1390421278.0,"I'm gonna throw this out here and assume that you're asian.

First step, don't use pictures of non-asians for your hair inspirations. You can use them to see what looks good, but don't assume it'll work for your hair, because it most likely won't. You need to specifically look up pictures of asian men pulling off a specific hair style because asian hair is straight and usually super thick, so you'll need to accommodate that.

Second step, get a good BARBER (don't go to super cuts or mega cuts or whatever). This phase in your hair style is going to be huge, and it's going to take several months to get the hair cut you like and the one that fits your face perfectly. So find a good barber, preferably someone who knows how to cut asian hair (using scissors more than shavers, shavers give the asian fro). Develop a good relationship with your barber and learn to trust them with your hair, because you wear your hair with literally every outfit, so it matters.

Third step, find some pictures and then figure out what you like. Get multiple pictures and bring them all to your barber, and your barber will tell you which one's will be able to do with your hair type. When I went from growing out my hair to getting a hairstyle, it took my barber about 2-3 trips to get the layering and texturing right (went about once a month, now I go about every 3 weeks). And don't be afraid to mess up, and if you do happen to mess up with a hairstyle, live with the fact that you're gonna have to have a sub-par haircut for a few weeks before you can cut it again."

My LDL has dropped super low, even lower than my HDL, which went up a bit. I actually started cooking to save money instead of eating out at lunch, but it has also improved my overall diet.

Knowing where to start can be the hard part. I do recommend thug kitchen (link below) simply because I found it an easy way to get into cooking. I also recommend cooking your week in advance on Sunday, that way it's already prepared.

My personal day:

Breakfast is salmon, nuts, and a banana

Daily snacks include yogurt and berries and vegetables with hummus, sometimes an apple.

I prepare lunch and dinner on Sunday, then eat it throughout the week.
For lunch I alternate: a quinoa dish one week, a brown rice and bean dish one week, and thug kitchen taco/burrito recipes for two other weeks (www.thugkitchen.com).

For dinners I am eating sauteed veggies (chopped and mixed on Sunday), chicken (cooked on Sunday), and a hard boiled egg (cooked on Sunday).

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1390421410.0,"It could be different. Usually the prescription vitamin D is D2 while most of the over the counter stuff is D3. D3 is considered more potent by some, although other people say it doesn't make that much difference. 

There is no harm in trying a different form, especially since you are getting tested regularly. It might be cheaper to get D3 over the counter than get it by prescription. I buy it off the Internet and a year's supply is less than $20.

As for dosing, the 50,000 IU is a weekly dose used to correct deficiency. Usually people only take it for 6-8 weeks, not years. The 5,000 IU is a daily dose. The maximum safe daily dose is 10,000 IU. When I was deficient (level was 21 ng/ml) I took 10,000 IU a day for 6 months then dropped back down to 5,000. After a year I dropped down to 4,000 (mostly because I found 2000 IU pills cheap) but went back up to 5,000 last year when I found cheap pills in that size. I feel better on 5,000 than 4,000.

Optimal blood levels for D are considered to be 50-70 ng/ml, although what optimal really means I am not sure. Lifeguards run around 70 during the summer. My endocrinologist has seen patients with a level of 100. I think how high your level gets is not strictly dose dependent, different people absorb it differently. Plus you get it from sun exposure. I tend to go outside a lot in the summer. You will have to experiment a bit to find what dosage gets your levels up and where you experience well-being. For me going from level 50 to 55 was beneficial. "

ptam,AskReddit,1390421412.0,"I'll take on Archer here, since I just to be ambivalent to the show but have recently just started watching it. It's been said before, but Archer is Arrested Development meets James Bond. It combines the excitement of espionage with expertly written comedy that constantly draws both laughs and adrenaline, teetering back and forth between serious situations with real consequences and hilarious banter and perfect comedic timing. Plotlines and jokes are constantly being interwoven and bounced backand forth, while being grounded by fantastical yet grounded elements of aspy drama. Take for example shooting a gun, which often in live action movies has little consequence. Archer flips that by making the characters ridiculous and having them use guns in almost every situation. Startled? Shoot. Suppressing fire! Shoot. Angry? Shoot. But then if you just blindly suppresing fire, bullets hit teammates and friendly fire happens. If you're angry and shoot at a lock you'retrying to break, ricochets occur and people yell at you or get hit. If you are startled and being firing next to your team, their ears ring and they drop in the brick joke ""TENITITIS!"" So it takes spy comedy, where you shoot at everything, spy drama, where people really get hit, and then combines it with jokes like ""Jesus Lana, my ears are ringing!"" which brings it back to both comedy and realism, and then you still have the KGB chasing you down, while you try to escape while you're laughing your ass off/you still can't hear shit."

I'd also like to mention the N64 controller. It got a lot of shit with the fact that the analog stick and D-pad were segregated with separate handles (which fixed a problem no one had and made a lot of people wonder how the fuck you were supposed to hold it) but once you figured out how to hold it (switching handles with your left hand depending on whether you wanted to control the analog stick or D-pad) it was a really comfortable controller due to the handles being really long, which gave you plenty of room for your grip.

Unrepentant_Priapist,todayilearned,1390421477.0,"&gt; Urban/Rural matters very much as in urban centers people are more likely to use mass-transit, thus lowering the number of deaths per thousand because of resultant less car-miles per thousand. Distance traveled surely plays into this as well.

There's a disparity in deaths per mile traveled, though:  The red state average is 0.15 deaths per million miles traveled, and the blue state average is 0.11 deaths per million miles traveled.  That's a 27% difference.

Trying to weight distance traveled by population isn't statistically sound.  Distance traveled is already a much more accurate indicator for our purposes than population, as it implicitly controls for the part of the population that doesn't drive and the disparity of driving habits among the part of the population that does drive.

mr_fishy,HannibalTV,1390421483.0,"Whenever I first saw it this is basically what I thought. My interpretation was that she was genuinely startled by that guy and didn't really mean to kill him but considering she just found a pillow full of the hair from one of her father's victims it's totally understandable that she would freak out and kill someone who snuck up on her while she was horrified and hyperaware.

Although I interpreted what Hannibal said to her as ""This looks really bad and people are going to assume you murdered him"" more than ""You just murdered him."" Of course, it's been a while since I haven't rewatched since it aired. What Hannibal said actually made a lot of sense and he was probably right - a jury would have a hard time believing that Abigail didn't mean to kill him, especially considering her dad was a serial killer and the guy was harassing her and her friend earlier. However, he was also definitely using the situation to his advantage so that he could further manipulate and isolate Abigail."

Kesshisan,polyamory,1390421637.0,"&gt;Much TL;DR: How do you communicate poly status to strangers without seeming slimy, presumptuous, or dishonest?

Relate something to your partner's other.  Examples:

""Oh yeah, my wife's partner was a great painter, too.""

""My wife dated a guy/girl last year who enjoyed red wine, but I'm more of a white wine person.""

Basically, show them that it's not just YOU sleezing around.  Show them that your wife is doing it, too!  (Read with a hint of sarcasm.  I know you're not really sleezing around, but it can sound like it.  I'm pretty sure that you know this, /u/nonoitsokayreally .)

However, this isn't solving the actual problem.  The problem you want to solve is ""How can I get more poly relationships?"" and you're asking ""How do I introduce myself as poly without being slimy?""  While this is a great question to be able to answer properly for introducing your non-poly friends to poly, the chances of you having a poly relationship with a non-poly person is very low.  So lets move away from that question and move onto the bigger question:  ""How can I get more poly relationships?""

Have you googled ""Polyamory forum""?  Reddit isn't the only place for polyamorous individuals.  See if you can find an online forum that hosts meet-and-greets in or near your area.  Try adding your local area to the google search ""Polyamory New York"" see if there's anything like that.

A lot of other people have said it already, and I'm repeating it here because it's important:  Try to hang out in places where polyamorous is the default relationship identification, not the exception.  This will remove the need to explain why you poly and how it is not slimy.  This will remove one hurdle to being accepted.

As an ugly guy myself, I'll be over here rooting for ya.  :)

I had to wait until everything opened in the morning, i.e. Play it the next day? I just wanted to play the game.

mkvgtired,technology,1390421808.0,"If you think Canadian telcos dont lobby their lawmakers, you might want to look into it a bit further. 

Your original comment implies its nice to read about these projects outside of the US, but its unfortunate laws prevent it ""here in the states"" collectively. If you were not talking about the US collectively you could have said ""some states in the US"", etc. When referring to ""The States"" it typically means the US as a country. US municipalities are actually leading with respect to municipal networks, that is why it is garnering so much foreign and domestic attention. 

If that is not what you meant you should work on phrasing and not get angry when someone misinterprets your statement by using the popular meaning about what you said. 

I never personally called you an ""idiot"" like you're doing to me. I had ""you're wrong"" but took it out because I thought it was a bit harsh. I agree with you that cable companies fighting these arrangements is bad, but implying they dont exist in the US is wrong. Saying you're wrong =/= calling you an idiot. But calling me stupid and telling me to go fuck myself certainly makes you seem like an asshole.

This wasn't the first time and it wouldn't be the last time that Rowan had taken a life. He'd been doing this since he was 14 and he'd found his stepfather plunging that same knife in to his mother's chest. In a strange way, Rowan had enjoyed that sight, it had made him feel a feeling that he'd never felt before.

Since that day, he had been trying to replicate the feeling he remembered, and had never quite managed. No matter how many women he found, no matter how long he kept them and no matter how he had dressed them, he still hadn't been able to feel the same as he had that day. 

From the age of 14, Rowan had been taking women from their homes as they slept, keeping them in his basement and dressing them in very specific clothing. When he thought the time was right, he'd lay them gently on the floor, straddle them and plunge his knife in to their chest. It had to hit a specific place, identical, and Rowan had marked the spot with his mother's lipstick on each and every woman he'd killed.

Deep down, he knew this wasn't normal and he knew that he should turn himself in to the police as the killer they've been searching for, but he couldn't. He had to get that feeling back. It wasn't something he wanted... It was something he needed."

annoyingrelative,nba,1390422122.0,"&gt;I think this is less legend than confirmed fact, but Karl Malone also tried to bang Kobe's wife...

It is confirmed.  This was back in 2004, and was reported on LA Sports talk radio, and several local newspapers.

[ ESPN story](http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1944994)

&gt;The Kobe Bryant-Karl Malone feud has turned personal, with Bryant accusing Malone of making a pass at his wife at a Lakers game.

Rob Pelinka, the agent for Bryant, told ESPN.com on Sunday night that Malone made ""several inappropriate comments"" to Bryant's wife, Vanessa, on Nov. 23 at a Los Angeles Lakers home game against the Milwaukee Bucks.

""Kobe and Karl had a true friendship, much more than teammates,"" Pelinka said. ""Their wives are quite friendly as well. Kobe has told me that he feels very hurt and betrayed by what has happened.""

Malone, in Arkansas working at his logging farm, declined to address accusations by Bryant.

""Misery loves company,"" Malone told USA Today in Tuesday's edition. ""This is a Hollywood soap opera, and I'm not going to be a star in another Bryant soap opera.""

Malone also said his wife, Kay, responded privately by letter Monday to the Bryants and Lakers owner Jerry Buss.

Bryant said to reporters before Sunday night's game against Orlando, ""The comments that [Malone] said, I don't know any man in this room that wouldn't be upset about that. The past month, myself, my wife, [Malone's wife] Kay, we've had fun together. We've been out to their house, just joking around, giving each other a hard time, just clowning, being sarcastic with one another, baby-sitting kids and all that.""

Asked if there could have been a misunderstanding, Bryant said, ""What he said is what he said. I believe in my heart that it wasn't a misunderstanding. My wife wasn't going to stand for it. She felt uncomfortable being around him to the point that she felt she had to call his wife and tell her.""

Bryant said Malone didn't deny making the comments and told him during their phone conversation, ""Aw, you know, I'm sorry if I said anything that was out of line."" Added Bryant, ""He was like a mentor, like a brother to me, so when something like that happens, you're upset, you're hurt.""

Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday that Malone was asked by Vanessa Bryant, ""Hey, cowboy, what are you hunting?"" in reference to Malone wearing a cowboy hat and boots.

""She said it twice,"" Manley said, ""and Karl answered, 'I'm hunting for little Mexican girls.' ""

Manley said Malone told him he had never made a pass at Bryant's wife, that he was surprised by the accusation, and that he then apologized to both Bryant and his wife for any remarks she might have considered inappropriate.


Pelinka, who works for SFX and has been Bryant's agent for four years, said he was told what transpired last month by Kobe and Vanessa Bryant.

""Karl and his son were at the game sitting in the front row,"" Pelinka said. ""Vanessa was on the cell phone talking to Karl's wife, Kay, and Vanessa said that her son looked bored. Kay told her to call Karl to have her son join her in her seats. Kay gave Vanessa Karl's cell number and she called him. When she called, Karl's response was, 'Why don't you come over here and sit next to me and give me a big hug?' Vanessa said, 'Why? For what?' And Karl replied, 'If you do that it will be on the cover of every magazine in the country.'

""Vanessa didn't know what to say because this was the first time she had ever spoken to Malone without Kobe or Kay being around. Karl continued. 'Do you like me?' Malone asked her, to which Vanessa said, 'As my friend, Kay's husband,' "" Pelinka said.

""From there Malone asked Vanessa if she could keep a secret, and that he would like to tell her something. At which point Vanessa told him she was a married woman and he was a married man who was old enough to be her father. To which Malone replied, 'Oh, like your daddy?' At that point she told me she ended the conversation,"" Pelinka said.

In the second half of the game, Malone sent his son to sit with the Bryants.

""Vanessa told me that she just was very uncomfortable at halftime and that Karl was acting and saying weird things."" said Pelinka. ""When the game ended, Vanessa walked Malone's son back to Karl. She told me that she asked Malone why he was wearing that [cowboy] hat. His response was, 'I'm hunting for young Mexican girls.' At which point Vanessa just walked away.""

On the car ride home, Vanessa Bryant told Kobe what had happened. Vanessa decided to call Kay Malone and tell her about the way her husband had spoken to her. After they hung up, Kobe Bryant called Karl Malone on his cell phone.

""Kobe told me that Karl just listened and didn't deny any of it. Kobe said Karl's only reply was, 'You know me, man.' To which Kobe told him, 'That's right, I do know you -- and stay away from my wife,' "" said Pelinka. ""The next day, with all four of them on the phone, Karl denied it. At that point the Bryants knew that there was nothing left to talk about since they knew Karl wasn't telling the truth. Vanessa told me that she told Kay that she [Vanessa] wanted her [Kay] to know 'just exactly what your husband [Karl] did, and you do what you want with the information.' ""


On the outside of the drama this time, Miami Heat center Shaquille O'Neal was amazed at this story.

""I'm very surprised how it came out, but I've never seen anything like that before,"" O'Neal told the Miami Herald. ""I thought him and Karl were best friends. Karl was always the liaison between me and that guy. I was under the impression they were closer than what they were.""

O'Neal said he would be surprised if Malone did anything inappropriate.

""He's a legend,"" O'Neal said. ""And if you don't like Karl Malone, there's something wrong with you.""

That means that the card found 5GB of stuff that it *could potentially* make use of and so it chose to cache it. It doesn't mean that it needed that much space. Windows 7/8 does the same thing with system RAM, it will cache things that it doesn't need, but that it thinks it might need later. If you have 16GB it will find ways to fill the space, even if your tasks only require 2GB.

The way to tell if you *actually* need the memory is if your performance drops from a memory constraint. An example of a major memory constraint is [2GB 770 playing Tomb raider at 4k](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-ti-review-benchmarks,3663-10.html). But you should note that even at 4k, 3GB is  usually perfectly fine.

[Here's a Battlefield 4 bench](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-780-ti-review-benchmarks,3663-5.html) - even at 4k, 2GB isn't a constraint on this test. Which isn't to say that 2GB it will *never* be a constraint, but it's pretty far-fetched to say that 5GB is a constraint for BF4 at 1080P. You're almost certainly fine with 3GB."

H335,CCW,1390422298.0,"&gt;Even if they dropped their guard and I saw an opportunity to break leather and get the drop on them. Because its not worth taking some ones life over a couple of bucks.

So at what point is it worth someone's life? $10? $20? $500? That is a false choice and the amount of money is a distractor. Perhaps that $5 is all the grocery money you have left for the week because your significant other lost their job.

The only issue here is that the aggressor made a choice to use illegal force or the threat of force to attempt to coerce compliant behavior from his intended victim. Determining whether the aggressor possesses the ability to follow through on their threat and inflict grave bodily harm or death should be the deciding factor. Not the article in question.

&gt;What if instead of asking for your wallet, they asked for your weapon? As the carrier of a weapon, you are responsible for what happens to your firearm. 

Once again, false choice. I am responsible for the actions I take with my sidearm, and for choosing to whom I voluntarily surrender my sidearm.

&gt;And if it's taken, there is a very good chance it will be used for crime and possible to take the life of some one else.

Irrelevant. If it has been *taken*, (i.e. surrendered under duress) it is no longer my responsibility. Following that logic ***you*** are personally responsible if you give money to a panhandler and he uses that to buy meth, goes on a binge, and kills somebody.

&gt;Is protecting your weapon from falling into the wrong hands a qualifier for lethal force?

I reiterate: The choice was made by the aggressor to use illegal force or the threat of force to attempt to cause me to act against my will. Committing a felony. The only factor for me is does the situation meet the criteria of ability, opportunity, and jeopardy. If the aggressor is *asking* me for my sidearm the assumption would be that they are displaying equal or greater force (multiple attackers, bigger gun, etc.) At that point if my gun leaves the holster it sure as heck isn't going to have the business end pointing anywhere but at them.

inevitabled34th,casualiama,1390422330.0,"When I was back in Laos this past summer, not having been there for over a decade. The company I've been with for some 13 odd years is supposed to be building a car factory over there (cheap labor, cheap taxes, cheap everything), but the jungle keeps fucking us over. Every time we make progress, we end up stumbling upon an unseen gorge, or someone uncovers an active, unexploded land mine from the Vietnam War. We found so many mines we actually had to hire a full-time team of bomb disposal technicians to take care of them. They mostly just sit around and do nothing. I've tried telling the lead supervisor (my boss) that it would be cheaper just to send them home and fly them out and then back whenever we need them. But he said that he doesn't want to risk it accidentally going off in between the time we find it and the time they get to the site. I don't know what I'm going to do anymore. The project is supposed to be done by 2015, but the way things have been going, I don't see us finishing for at least another 2-3 years. I don't know man, maybe it's me. Staying positive over there is hard because I can never get used to being without my wife and kids. 4 months of separation does things to you man. Not infidelity types of things, god I love my wife, but things like depression. Wake up sad, eat breakfast sad, go to work with pretend happiness, eat lunch alone and cry halfway through, go back to work with pretend hapiness, go back to my company-provided apartment sad, eat dinner sad, play xbox sad, browse reddit sad, shower sad, skype my family with pretend hapiness, and fall asleep sad listening to the city below.

And seeing as the individual agencies are in national competition the problem spreads easily. Then there's the fact that the Yakuza are in cahoots with public bodies all over the place. While the Yakuza actually lowers crime rates in a way (petty criminals are too scared to operate on their turf) it also means that Yakuza crimes go uninvestigated due to people being too scared to report them or the police being to eager to turn a blind eye.

And the part about non-ethnic Japanese refers to the Burakumin who are sort of excluded from the rights of ethnic Japanese, that often includes their right to a proper investigation when crime happens in those circles, and that's assuming that they would even report it (unlikely)."

* Mortgage: Lots of tax deductions around this and the related house. Plus, you know, shelter.
* Student loan: Tax deductible-interest
* Car loan: No up-sides, just a depreciating asset that continues to cost you money in maintenance and interest the longer you hold the loan.

So with that out of the way, **you need to eat more for your health.** Like other people have said, your body needs a certain amount of calories for base subsistance. Let's say it's around 2000 for you. If you're only eating 1200 per day, and you burn 1200 per day doing cardio, that is like if you went about your day *eating nothing at all*. That's how you starve to death. I'm amazed you find it in you to keep doing cardio for 2 hours a day when you're basically starving.

Part of it comes from going on dates with assholes who kind of send out vibes like, ""I paid for dinner and drinks, you owe me _____"" (insert (heh) some sexual activity).

DieMensch-Maschine,AskHistorians,1390422432.0,"Depends on the definition of ""sexual abuse.""  If you're referencing the contemporary problem of (Catholic) sexual abuse of children, I haven't come across any accounts in my research.  (I work on late sixteenth, seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries in Central/Eastern Europe.)  Starting in the later sixteenth century, bishops tended to be increasingly mindful of clerical shortcomings in their respective dioceses, especially in response to Protestant accusations of Catholic clerical (sexual) laxity.  By the later sixteenth century, episcopal visitation records and so-called letters of supplication (from parishioners or village communes) became ever more frequent and recording of professional, spiritual, financial or moral clerical deficiencies became more routine and standardized.  Throughout this period, I have come across numerous examples of parish priests being sexually involved with their female parishioners, both married and single.  Some were listed as young as 14 or 15, but this was hardly considered child abuse in the period.  Reports of same-sex indiscretions were rarer still, in my experience, usually confined to monastics (in this case, both male and female).  According to ecclesiastical court records, punishments for clerical transgressors would include fines, sometimes imprisonment in the cathedral dungeon, sometimes outright removal from a benefice.  In answer to your question, this isn't to say that instances of child sexual abuse did not take place.  However, given their absence in the source base, it's fair to say that they were much more rare than the garden variety transgression of seducing the miller's daughter.

CaspianX2,videos,1390422482.0,"Before the most recent election, Democrats had a majority, but not a supermajority, which meant that any raising of taxes or increases of funds had to be approved by two-thirds majority, which Republicans stonewalled. So on this, the most important issue the state was facing, he didn't have much more power than Schwarzenegger. And while the propositions Brown pushed weren't exactly celebrated, they were still accepted enough to *pass*.

Conversely, in the special election Schwarzenegger called, the propositions that were on the ballot were an abortion ""parental notification"" law intended to stifle access to abortion, an attack on teachers' tenure, a union-busting law intended to limit the power of unions to spend money on behalf of their members, a bill that would limit state spending in a short-sighted across-the-board fashion, a Texas-style redistricting law, a discount drug law that was mainly put on the ballot to confuse voters regarding the other discount drug law on the ballot (which might've been good, but who knows), and a law to make it harder for Californians to switch energy providers.

Schwarzenegger had no intention to raise revenue. His only plan was attacking state employees, which was little more than a scapegoat for the state's problems. Brown took a more balanced approach, with moderate reductions to state spending *and* attempting to (and succeeding in) raising revenue through additional taxes on the wealthy. And now that the state's budget is looking better, he's making good on his earlier promises to return some funding to schools.

So, a balanced approach, which is absolutely *not* what Schwarzenegger was attempting. Not even close.

Also, just because Schwarzenegger wasn't a crazy far-right bible-thumping science-hating Republican doesn't mean he was a good politician. It just meant that he was as far-right as a liberal state like California could tolerate... and even then, only just barely."

Or, if you have a very high end system with unusually high resolution, even a single top-tier card simply will not have the power to give you satisfactory performance, so you have to go the (very expensive) route of putting together multiple top-tier cards.

To me it sounds like you're an average straight guy who is really comfortable with himself, as well as other people who are different from you, and that's not a bad thing by any means. I've had a lot of friends in the past who said that they were accepting of the fact that I'm queer, but they never really want to go to events with me or talk about it or probably even think about it. They accept my personality, but really my identity and community makes them uncomfortable. I'd be quicker to call those people phony than you.

As long as you don't try to claim you're something you're not, or go to events that are meant to be safe spaces for queer people only (support groups, for example), or try to assert your thoughts or opinions as more important than the queer people around you, there's no reason why you shouldn't help out and support them."

screenmagnet,sex,1390422867.0,"Look into the copper IUD (no hormones) or the hormonal IUD (progestogen only; the hormones mostly stay local, but some does enter the bloodstream; definitely the safest hormonal method/lowest level of systemic hormone exposure out there). If you want a highly effective method of contraception with low side effect profile, this is the way to go. 

Main differences between them:
- copper IUD is easier to insert, especially if you have never given birth
- hormonal IUD is about 4 times more effective than the copper IUD (in first year of use, 2 in 1000 women will get pregnant, compared to 8 in 1000 women for the copper IUD; over life of device, 7 in 1000 women will get pregnant compared to 22 in 1000 women for copper IUD). 
- copper IUD can make periods heavier and cramps worse; hormonal IUD does the opposite (can make periods disappear altogether)
- copper IUD is cheaper
- copper IUD lasts 10 years, while the hormonal IUD lasts 5 or 3 years depending on the model

Risks and side effects for both:
- cramping for up to a couple weeks after insertion
- spotting for up to 6 months after insertion
- small risk of uterine perforation, could require surgery (about 1 in 1000, probably more if it is a resident, med student, or family doc inserting it).
- risk of expulsion, requiring reinsertion, around 5-10%, higher risk in women who have not given birth
- some women or their partners may find the strings uncomfortable, can usually be fixed by trimming the strings, but this makes it harder to check that it is still in place
- if you do get pregnant, there is a higher rate of ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage, which could require surgery
- for the hormonal IUD only, there is an increased risk of ovarian cysts, rarely a problem, but can cause pelvic pain

My boyfriend is fine with it, he knows we're close but he also knows I think of him completely differently. That's where your boyfriend is going wrong. He isn't making you feel more important, and he isn't showing how he thinks of her differently to you.

bluntbangs,TwoXChromosomes,1390422927.0,"Never check the colour of foundation on your hands! The skin is much tougher, and generally a different colour. 

Most make-up counters have small mirrors, and often displays have mirrored panels. Take a small amount on the tip of your finger or a tissue and then pat it onto your jawline. If it disappears then you're good to go (I usually double check by also checking the shade either side of the one I think works). Wipe any visible stuff off with a tissue. 

If you can, take a mirror to an area of the shop where there's daylight because often foundation can look different in different lighting. If you can't, leave the shop and take a subtle selfie to check the colour."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390423124.0,"I agree on the controversial questions - it's like those lawyers in movies/tv shows that try to ask a yes/no question that shouldn't really be a yes/no question.  If you're forced to answer, no matter what, you lose.

Okay, I'll try to cover everything - if you feel like I missed something or have questions, feel free to ask, and I'll clarify/add.

First off, I don't think okcupid has a ""go live"" button or something like that.  The problem with that is if you add your pictures first and then have no profile, someone might look, see you're boring, and then move on without ever looking at you again.  Always get a decent profile together first and THEN add the pictures.  If you *really* want to make your chances better, then know what all the categories are first, have everything written up, then quickly copy+paste the entire profile over.

Speaking of pictures, like I said, one close up face shot which should be your main picture - it's what people initially see before looking at your profile.  The second picture should be a full body shot THAT IS HONEST so people get an idea of what you look like from day to day - you can look a little nicer in this, but it should look like you.  Finally, if possible, have an action shot, which could really be anything - running  in an event, laughing like in my case, playing pool, whatever.

The profile is a bit harder to tackle because I don't remember everything on there, but I know some of the stuff.  The MOST IMPORTANT THING is to be 100% honest with who you are in the profile.  In other words, don't tailor it to what you think people will want to see.  The reason for this is say you're a gamer and you think it might turn people off, so you omit it.  You go on a few dates, and now the guy realizes your a gamer, and he's not into that at all.  You both would have been better off had you not specifically kept that out, because now you have to stop seeing each other because it's a dealbreaker for him.  Having a true to yourself profile (it doesn't have to be overly detailed, but you get the point) is the best way to ensure that your matches are actually GOOD matches.

Next, talk a little about yourself.  The acronym **F**amily **O**ccupation **R**ecreation **D**reams is a pretty good one.  You can leave out the family *unless their super important to you), but give a little about what you do, what you like to do in your spare time (or would like to with a partner), and maybe even what you'd like to do in the future (e.g. I've been saving up to take a trip to Italy because I've been wanting to do that since I was little).  Keep it short, just make sure it doesn't sound dull.  Imagine you're not you, but your friend Lucy, and you're trying to set Lucy up with someone you know.  What would you say to make her sound interesting and enticing to the person you want her to be set up with?

There's also one about movies/tv shows/music/books, I believe.  Don't go crazy, but list some, it helps.  It's cool if you guys have a common interested - for example, the following behind shows like Doctor Who or Avatar: The Last Airbender are pretty huge, so if you meet someone that shares those interests, you're likely to get a ""Whoa, I watch that, too, awesome!"" type of reaction.  For music, don't be one of those ""I like everything but metal!"" people and leaves it at that - it's okay to say something like that if you then give some examples of ""but here are some of my favorites.""  

Then there's the 6 things I can't live without?  Here's my problem with how seemingly 95% of the population answers this question (and keep in mind, when I say ""you"" it's in a general sense, not targeting you specifically).  I've worked in retail and I obviously work in restaurants (username), but I've been a server, too.  Let me tell you - if you an item doesn't ring up, it's free, and if a customer clears their plate, it was clearly awful and you should bring out another so they could make sure.  It may seem funny to you because you've said it just the ones, but that cashier/server has heard it about 10 times *that day*.  I'm sure you noticed how many people do this in their profiles ""I need water, oxygen, food, etc."" Not helpful.  I sometimes think it's fine left blank, but other times, I think it can be interesting.  I can clearly live without ""duck fat,"" but I think it says something interesting about me.  But ""my macbook pro"" makes me want to punch you in the face, unless it's so specific to your job that you seriously couldn't function without it.

Then there's the ""message me if"" question.  Ugghhhhhhh seriously hate this question.  It's so terrible. I'm not kidding you, out of all the profiles I've seen, I have seen ONE PERSON that had an answer that I actually thought was clever.  I don't remember what it was, but it was surprisingly original, and I almost forced my friend to message him just because he was *that* clever.  

Then the questions - answer as many as you can of the important ones, skipping all the stupid ones (if you have to think, don't waste your time).  The rating of the questions is VERY IMPORTANT.  This is how they rate matches.  It's something like 250 pts for ""mandatory,"" 50 pts for ""very important"" and so on down the line (0 for irrelevant).  If it's not that important to you, then say so, but it's still helpful to answer because of the ""unacceptable answers"" portion of viewing your matches.

So unless I missed something, I covered how to make the profile. Next is how to find a match.

Usually, I take a quick look at the top matches, so maybe 95+% or 90+%.  Look through, and be honest with yourself, like I said, ALWAYS.  If the person doesn't look attractive enough, don't waste your time (or theirs).  If there is a dealbreaker, don't make excuses.  Stick to how you really feel, and move on.  There are more people out there, you'll find someone.

Next, I go through the rating portion of the matching - quicklook?  Quickmatch?  Something like that.  Basically, they offer for you to match the person using a star rating system - I never click the stars, because I think it's dumb.  The sort of ""loophole"" here is if you skip someone, it will say ""you have just skipped Tuala08.""  So if I found you interesting, I skip you, then I click your profile, and I don't have to give you some superficial, arbitrary rating.  

But anyway, the way it works is to be FAST.  Look at the pictures - if they are unappealing, then skip.  If they are attractive enough to fit your standards, then take a quick look of their profile.  If there are no obvious problems or anything, then what I do is skip them, hold cmd or ctrl depending on the computer, and then click their profile.  It will open them in a new tab.  KEEP GOING WITH THE MATCHING.  Do this until you have maybe 10 tabs open, and then go back and check them all out.

First thing I did ALWAYS was look at ""the two of us"" and ""unacceptable answers."" If they have any dealbreakers, close the tab and don't look back.  They have a cat and you think you can deal with it?  False, you die every time your around cats, don't put yourself through that hell. Move on.  But okay, no dealbreakers.  Take a look at the profile.  Do the same thing.  Everything looks good, they seem interesting enough?  Go to the two of us and take another quick browse through.  Maybe they answered some questions I didn't - the unacceptable part is only based off what you *both* answered.  Maybe they want to ""kill the jews,"" and you're not looking to date hitler.  Move on.

So you find someone that works for you.  And remember, it's okay to be a little picky - find someone that makes you go ""wow, I really want to meet this person!""  Things like that and never making excuses just because the person is hot or whatever will make the matches more likely to work out.

Anyway, the message is next, and I always sent the same type of message.  I forget how I opened, but it was usually just something like ""Hello!  How has your day been? Hope everything's been going well!""  I like it, because it's nice, pleasant, gives them the option to tell me any cool news, or they can just say ""good"" and move on.  Next, I say something about their profile that I think is really cool.  ""Oh man, if you like fish tacos, you've GOT to check out Mancho Cafe in San Gabriel.  Best fish tacos of your life, I promise.  I've tried everywhere, and nothing compares, they're just too good.""  Next, I make an open-ended question that can't be answered with one word. I HATE when people ask me something that's like...I dunno, this is a terrible example, but ""what's your favorite color?""  All I can say here is ""green.""  Anything else is excessive.  Ask something about the person based on what you saw in their profile that will MAKE THEM TALK.

After that, just continue with the messages - make sure you end every message with something open ended so that the conversation flows - it's a weird format and clearly not ""normal"" conversation, so this kinda stuff is necessary or else the conversation *will* die out.  I'd recommend switching to something like gchat or texting eventually, and then when conversation seems to be flowing well enough, ask to meet for coffee and suggest a day.  Go to coffee at a time when you think neither of you will be busy for a while and so that if you want, you can stay for a long time *but also* give yourself an out in case you need it and don't want to be to blunt.  If things go well, and you want to see them again, then SAY SO.  Something like ""we should do this again"" or ""by the way, I know this KILLER fish taco joint, we should go check it out!  I'm free on Saturday if you're interested.""  Then go from there with the standard stuff."
BrandNewSidewalk,PlusSize,1390423126.0,"Have you tried NY&amp;Co (I think it used to be called Lerner?)  When I was inbetween sizes like you are now, that store used to work for me when nowhere else did.  Their 16 is larger than say, The Limited, or American Eagle's 16.  I used to wear a 16 pants/skirts/etc from Lerner at the same time I wore a 14 jeans from Lane Bryant.  At the time, I was a pear shape and mostly carried weight in my hips/butt/stomach.

Unfortunately I gained a bunch of weight after that (thyroid problems,  meh) and can now only shop from Plus Sizes.  Oddly, I have more blue jeans that fit well now than I did back then.

Another place you might try is Cato Fashion http://www.catofashions.com/ if you have one nearby.  Their clothes are cute pretty cheap, which is great for someone in a plateau because you don't want to put a lot of money into it.  If I recall correctly, their stuff runs a little on the large side too, and they have both misses and plus in the same store (often the same outfit in both size ranges) so you can shop between departments.  This is handy if you need a regular size top and plus size pants, or vice versa.  Sizes can be very inconsistent, so don't be discouraged if the first thing you try doesn't fit."

DragonFireKai,magicTCG,1390423143.0,"I run a mono white heroic deck fairly successfully at my local FNM, and I'm tinkering with a U/W heroic deck.

There are four elements that any heroic deck needs to be effective. Heroic creatures, heroic enablers, a means of defense, and a means of reaching your opponent.

Your deck has oodles of heroic creatures, but only four cards providing reach, and only two really providing defense. So what you wind up with is a bunch of overcosted creatures that will get two for oned by midrange decks, and run over by aggro.

the soul of heroic is voltron. The idea that you can invest cards in a creature, protect that creature, and ride him to a victory paved with the skulls of your enemies. However what good is it if your mighty creature gets blown off the board by every jackass with a doom blade? 

Here's the list for the blue white deck I'm working on. I'll walk you through the though process behind each card.

4x battlewise hoplite: this is pretty much the core of the deck. He comes in quick on turn two, and when fitted with recurring triggers, he gets very big, very fast, and allows you to screen bad draws in the process.

2x fabled hero: brutally short clock when you can trigger heroic. Turn three hero, turn four aqueous form and hidden strings means eight damage on turn four, ten damage on turn five. If they don't answer it, it's game.

2x Daxos of Melatis: honestly, I'd probably do better with 2 more fabled heroes, but daxos is a solid way to cipher in hidden strings, provides some life gain, and makes people go crazy. You never know what you're gonna get. ""Oh, look, boros reckoner! I reckon that's gonna be a problem.""

2x judges familiar: a touch of poke, a touch of reach, and a modicum of insurance for those when you tap out on turn two or three to play a bruiser. Also a handy sack bitch for flares, devours, and aways.

2x thassa's emmisary: it provides card advantage when combined with aqueous form. Scry on the attack, draw on damage. It procs heroic, and also lives through board wipes when bestowed. slap it on daxos for loads of hate.

2x skymark roc: it provides some poke and reach, and it gets rid of swan song tokens. I was debating between this and the ascended lawmage, but the lawmage kept dying to bird tokens, it was kinda embarrassing.

4x aqueous form: best means of reach in the game right now. One mana, unblockable, scry on attack. Useful on any creature, if only for the deck filtration.

4x hidden strings: when combined with aqueous form, it basically gives two creatures vigilance, and it procs every time you connect with the enemy. It allows your heroic creatures to keep growing as long as you can reach the enemy, and allows them to do so without compromising your capacity to block.

4x mizzium skin: great defense, stops all spot removal, doesn't risk unfortunate side effects like gods willing or brave the elements. Procs heroic, gives a spot of toughness. all for one mana.

4x swan song: a one mana counter to pretty much everything that threatens your voltron. Use it to screen in a late creature against control, stop sac effects or board sweepers. works on everything save that nasty verdict. And the skymark roc will clean up the tokens.

4x detention sphere: good for btes, rat races, and all manner of problematic enchantments, artifacts, creatures, and planeswalkers.

2x elspeth, suns champion: truth be told, I pulled three of them, and my standard white deck curves out at 3 mana, so I couldn't justify using them. But I love the card, and this deck is slower, but more stable than the mono white deck, and as such, can actually find a use for a couple of them. It helps stabilize after a control deck hits verdict. Which is probably going to happen at some point, seeing as this deck is incapable of a turn three or four kill.

1x bident of thassa: enables card draw, similar to the emmisary, and can force a favorable attack if need be to clear chumps.

3x triton tactics: strong heroic trigger, can keep a creature alive through burn, and can catch people off guard.

20x land: 4x hallowed fountains, 4x azorious guildgates, 8x plains, 8x islands: with the amount of scry provided by the hoplites and aqueous forms, you can afford to run a little light on mana, and screen your draws until you have the appropriate amount.

It's important not to overcommit with this deck. Typically you want one primary creature, either a hoplite, daxos, or a hero, with and aqueous form, an emmisary if possible, and a hidden strings on it. Hold onto everything else. Use mizzium skin, swan song, and detention sphere to protect the creature, and screen your draws to that idea with the scry. If the opponent manages to stop that creature, then drop a new one and repeat the process until his life is zero.

To save money make you food at the hostels instead of eating out everywhere.  It also gives you the chance to support local markets.

Even if you aren't in school anymore, bring school ID for museum discounts and such.

If you can invest in a backpack with wire mesh.  If someone tries to cut open you pack and steal your stuff you will be more protected.

Get some sort of wallet you can hide under your clothes.  Check it often.  Carry as little cash as you can on you.  ATMs aren't that hard to find.

If you use ATMs or cards be sure to call you cards before you leave.  They will make sure you have access and that they don't freeze your card.

You don't need to bring technology.  You really don't.  I brought a laptop once and it was just a hassle.  Never again!

Try to have a companion with you, especially when going out at night.  Don't be afraid to speak to the locals.

If you can arrange a work/board situation I found them to be the best to connect with local people and experience things you might not as a general tourist.  I did a lot of volunteer archaeology.  It was AWESOME.

You don't need to go everywhere.  There are some places worth skipping.  As a lone female I pretty much skipped eastern Europe entirely.

Pack for all seasons.  Things that can double up are great, such as pants that can be unzipped into short and are water resistant.  

If you aren't picky about toiletry brands and such: get them when you arrive.  Go minimal.  You can be weighed down by your belongings easily.  Over the years I have packed less and less and it's been getting better each time.

Save your receipts.  As an American I was able to get some of my tax expenses reimbursed.  But it's a pain. 

You don't need to buy everything you see.  I limit myself to a coffee mug, shotglass or one other item when traveling.  Send postcards instead of getting gifts for everyone.

1. This is interesting, do guys need a girl around to push them to do interesting things?

3. Why is the onus to create an interesting message all on me? If I write to a guy first I will work hard to write a cool message, but if a guy can't be bothered to write more than 'hey' why should I do more?

5. That is a new one on me. I thought guys didn't like to be 'fixed'?

6. I have no idea, this guy had doctored his photo to look like a zombie and there was no explanation. It wasn't a costume, he didn't say why he did or anything. It just seemed really scary.

7. Do girls post photos of their handbags though? I apparently see online dating differently than most people though. I don't write my profile with just a bunch of random facts about me, I try and think what my target market would like to read. So I do not go on and on about my favourite clothes or cats or whatever else so to me, it doesnt make a lot of sense to go on and on about cars when so few girls are interested.

8. Group photos are nice, but I still don't like the pictures with girls though people here have explained they often only get their pic taken when a girl insists.  However, I know of many who have pictures with their exes up. In fact one ex posted one of us and I had to report it to get him to take it down. The most recent guy I tried to date was still so wrapped up in his first serious girlfriend that even after sleeping with 27 women he still wasn't over it.

VoxMeretricis,relationships,1390423321.0,"I guarentee you, you will ruin your friendship with her if you ask her out after months of being friends and she's not into you. There is actually a great post in /r/bestof right now commenting on the girlfriendzone - basically, that point when the girl finds out after months that what a guy wants isn't friendship, it's a girlfriend. You know what goes through her head? ""Wow, he spent the last howevermany months being nice to me just to try and get in my pants."" Doesn't matter if that was your sole motivation or not, you've just taught her she can't trust you to be straightforward with her about your intentions.

Look, if you ask her now and she says no, you take a month or two to get rid of your feelings for her, reconnect, and then you two can be actual friends. You ask her after months of friendship, and she says no, and that's the end of both a potential relationship and a great friendship - you will not be able to salvage it. In the end, it's up to you, but don't complain six months from now about how you've been ""friendzoned"" because you've been such an awesome guy to her and don't understand why she's going out on dates with other people and can't understand that you're really the guy for her. 

Of course, if she's into you, then this won't be a problem. But in my experience, a guy's chance of getting a date with a girl actually decreases the longer they're friends, not increases - maybe your experience will differ. "

Is it really that wrong?  It's the same thing.

jianadaren1,todayilearned,1390423504.0,"From your link

&gt;Stereotypes are overgeneralizations; they often involve assuming a person has certain characteristics based on unfounded assumptions.

So stereotypes are *bad* generalizations. They're still generalizations though, just poorly done with unfounded assumptions (aren't all assumptions unfounded? If they were founded they wouldn't be assumptions they'd be just knowledge).

I think this paragraph of hers is the most telling:

&gt;These are not generalizations, they are stereotypes. They are assumptions based on unfounded ideas about these groups, not identifying particular characteristics of a group of people. They signify a gap or lack in understanding. We typically stereotype those whom we do not understand or about whom we have no knowledge.

Basically if your knowledge/understanding is good then it's a generalization, else it's a stereotype. So if you have good reputable evidence that ""X tends to Y"" then it's a generalization, but if you don't have good evidence that ""X tends to Y"" but you assume it anyway then that's a stereotype.

That's very problematic because their are lots of racist/sexist stereotypes that have excellent evidence to support them. Women definitely do worse in math - it's been tested and observed repeatedly. Though by her definition it's not a stereotype."

There's a lot of problems in the world, and they've picked one particular issue to focus on. Just as well to ask them why they aren't doing more regarding immigration issues, or fixing socioeconomic inequality in third world countries, or AIDS prevention oversees.

Most will agree that those are issues worthy of concern, but it's hard to actively pursue more than one or two without spreading themselves so thin they do no good whatsoever.

And of course some get so hung up on their own pet issue that they completely discount those faced by others. But overall, I suspect that most would agree that removing inequality is a good thing, while also acknowledging that some fights just aren't theirs."

Monosentence,leagueoflegends,1390423590.0,"Indeed, he didn't. You can parrot that I misunderstood what the dude said over and over, but that doesn't make it so.

Let me explain. I saw that he was talking about his field, and comparing the size and arm time (10 seconds) to the over-exaggerated stuns and such in Dota 2. I started my comment with a rather annoyed comment at the time, because it seems that as soon as something is OP or what have you, these really weird things come out of the woodworks to explain how bad it is.

Like the conversation about Kha'Zix today. ""Omg isolation is OP!""

Then don't be isolated. Part of his kit is geared towards hunting isolated prey, and the counterplay is strength in numbers. 

With Ziggs, his minefield is ""OP""- Now that he's come into this pseudo power, there are eyes looking everywhere to explain *how* he's too strong. 

The arm time of his minefield is negligible if you aren't caught by it. Look at it this way: If Ziggs uses his minefield too soon, he's left without a viable slow/escape aside from satchel which has a long cooldown. This also means he can't use the minefield *elsewhere* until its off cooldown. Once its down, its down for the duration unless its cleared by a minion wave or what have you.

The counterplay is avoidance. He may be able to lock down an area with it (The narrow path behind the red buffs come to mind), but if you hadn't gotten to/on him by that point your play should be punished by having the chase stopped.

It looks like everyone basically downvoted me to hell for having an opinion, then talking about facts about the champion. The problem isn't with Ziggs; Its his current environment. Tone down the Siege/burst comp meta, and Ziggs will fall back to where he was. Nobody bothered to read my other comments about it, nor farther than me stating how dumb it is to even *bring up* the duration of effects in **ANOTHER** game.

That was my problem with it. I didn't misunderstand it. I knew what he was saying. Pulling facts out of your ass about another game with different meta, different champions, and a vastly different balancing system is just dumb. 

Lux has a total of, if she lands her Q and E fully on a single target, 7 seconds of crowd control before reductions. Both skills can deny movement through an area, the E having a 5 second arm time and an explosion you can trigger.

The only thing I could get behind is, and I haven't tested this part of the minefield in a while, how far the hitbox is for the *outside ring* of the minefield. If you get caught in the middle, you deserve to be slowed, but if you just happen to juke around the outside of the circle and the hitbox extends slightly outward- that *extra area should be trimmed.*

I'll have to test it and check back on that. The only other thing could be adding an extra moment for an opponent to react to the minefield, or a duration that expires once you exit a certain distance similar to Heimer's turrets.

Idk. I just don't want people basing nerfs and buffs off of totally separate things. "

Are you more of a morning person, or more of a night person? Are you getting enough sleep in a night, but still waking up really early? 

I used to get this when I tried to workout in the mornings before school.  I got 8 hours of sleep, but I got up at 5 or 6. Ordinarily, I prefer waking up as late as I possibly can given school/work circumstances.
 
 I switched to exercising in the afternoons or late morning, and get the same amount of sleep each night. I still get sleepy an hour or two later, but usually at times when I can conveniently nap or go to bed for the night."

marco262,gaming,1390423922.0,"This is more the fault of the way the Trademark and Intellectual Property laws are set up than King. A company can lose its rights to a trademark by not actively defending its rights. [Link to an actual article here](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/candy-crush-saga-dev-says-it-s-trying-to-fend-off-copycats-not-stop-the-banner-saga/1100-6417275/).

This means that, if King didn't file opposition to the Banner Saga's trademarks, later when an attempted copycat game that's actually trying to unfairly clone King's games comes out, King's position could be seen as weaker because the other company could show that King hasn't been diligent in protecting their property rights.

Taken from the article I linked above:

&gt; ""King has not and is not trying to stop The Banner Saga from using its name. We do not have any concerns that The Banner Saga is trying build on our brand or our content,"" a representative for the company told Gamasutra.
&gt;
&gt; Then why file the notice of opposition at all? King says the company is simply trying to defend its position under the terms of trademark law.
&gt;
&gt; ""However, like any prudent company, we need to take all appropriate steps to protect our IP, both now and in the future. In this case, that means preserving our ability to enforce our rights in cases where other developers may try to use the Saga mark in a way which infringes our IP rights and causes player confusion,"" the representative said. ""If we had not opposed The Banner Saga’s trademark application, it would be much easier for real copy cats to argue that their use of 'Saga' was legitimate.""

* I'm really smart and can carry on a good conversation. I've been known to jump back and forth from constitutional law to biology to  physics to poop jokes.

* I'm a pretty great lover, and I give head like a boss. I'm also pretty much up for anything you are.

* I love to let you know I'm thinking of you. Roses are the fucking bomb.

* I'm not insecure or crazy, and I'm pretty laid back in general.

* I'm pretty sure I'll be an awesome dad eventually.

Cons:

* I lose my boner a lot, and usually can't come in you.

* I don't know what I want to do with my life. I'd love to figure out together though!"

For some people, being used can mean one person taking advantage of another persons emotional feelings towards them, knowing they won't reciprocate it. For others, it might be sex that is purely mechanical where no emotion is being expressed by the one ""using"" the other.

It seems like you are classifying a non-emotional sexual experience from both partners as being used. It carries a very ""no harm, no foul"" connotation that to me, isn't really being used, that is just casual sex. You aren't feeling taken advantage of in some aspect.

Most doctors offices dont have an autoclave. I would put money on this.

Anyone who has worked in a lab for more than five seconds *knows* their lab coat is covered in bacteria. That's why you can't take them out of lab with you. You keep it in the lab, wear it there, and then pack it for transport to an autoclave to be sanitized. That's the procedure.

There's also a lot built up on wordplay, which will get lampshaded when a character says ""phrasing..."" and again, I don't think it's intrinsically laugh out loud hilarious, but definitely a more cerebral laughter.

marco262,gaming,1390424288.0,"King isn't suing Stoic. This is an important point to make here.

Stoic is attempting to trademark their game's name, and King is filing an opposition to the trademark. [Link here](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/22/king-are-trying-to-candy-crush-the-banner-saga/)

This is a song-and-dance that lets King show they are doing their due diligence in protecting their trademark in case any ACTUAL copycats come in and try to make something else called, let's say, ""Diarrhea Saga"" using King's branding style. King is stuck with trademarking generic words because the name of their products are made up of generic words. Doing otherwise would make it more difficult for them to get actual copycats removed, under current IP law.

[King has stated that they aren't trying to block Stoic from winning their trademark](http://www.gamespot.com/articles/candy-crush-saga-dev-says-it-s-trying-to-fend-off-copycats-not-stop-the-banner-saga/1100-6417275/)."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390424308.0,"The whole ""women don't like football"" thing is mostly a sitcom stereotype, same as the ""fat doofy husband who rolls his eyes at the thought of shopping"". Most women I know like football, and at all the bars in my area, game day crowds are pretty evenly split between men and women. I myself like to watch football but I don't really have a favorite team. I played fantasy for a few years. If I weren't concerned about doxxing my friends, I'd screencap my current Facebook wall to give you an idea about how many women I know who like football. Hell, I'd even argue it's more of a family type thing these days. Which would mean that these couples have mutual interests. Hmm... 

Maybe 20 years ago that might be true, less and less these days are little girls being criticized for liking ""boy things"" and there are plenty of women my age who were never told that we weren't supposed to like football. As our society continues to move towards gender equality, I imagine that a growing number of men and women will organically develop hobbies regardless of which gender traditionally enjoyed them in the past.

This should get me some pretty quick income (~$60k/yr) to live on, as well as getting me the $500k back in 18 months or so (cash-out refi after improving NOI).  I would use the rest to start a 'we buy houses for cash' business, possibly a homevestors franchise, and look for deals with &gt;100% return on capital gains and &gt;25% cash-on-cash after expenses.

Also, you understand there is a lot more to eating healthy than calorie count? It's much healthier to eat a 3000 calorie diet of all natural, whole foods, than a 2500 calorie diet of exclusively McDonalds. There are many macro and micro nutrients that you are replacing with things like sugar and saturated fats that are detrimental to your system.

I could eat McDonalds every day for a year and not notice any impact, but when I have a heart attack at the age of 50, it will be clear that there was. Not all effects are immediate."

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1390424535.0,"I think your music quote will be off; whole bands usually charge at least a grand for a full night of work (remember that they're splitting the money between all of the members, so the more people, the higher their fee).

Decor will probably wrack up WAY over $100.  I'd budget $300 for very very simple decor.

Are you doing any center pieces?  Flowers, or otherwise?  I don't see that included.
Are you doing any cakes or desserts?  Or will that be included with drinks and dinner?
Favors?

That photography budget is slick, OP.  The rest of your budget seems very frugal (right in line with what I would spend for our $6K wedding in TX) and then BAM!  Photography.  I'm glad y'all found an item to splurge on!

&gt;  They also rent out the space above the restaurant. It's used by a dance company most days, but they rent the space we want at $75/hour.

So they DONT charge for dinner in the 60-person dining room, and that's where you'll have apps, dinner, and drinks?  What is this other area for?  Jazz and dancing?  Having dinner and dancing in separate places might be weird; what if some people want to take longer to eat, or just enjoy their dessert while they talk?  Will there be tables upstairs?  Do you have to pay to rent those?

&gt;   We get ready separately, and get whisked off by the photographer for an hour or two. He captures the first look, etc.

How will y'all get to the first look location?  You'll need two cars if you don't want to see each other before that.  If you're in a wedding dress that's hard to sit in, you'll need someone to drive you.  Maybe your siblings?

&gt;  Then, onto appetizers and drinks, dinner, and dessert (all slow paced and catered by the restaurant) with jazz/swing music. 

Apps, dessert, drinks and dinner is all included in the $1200 budget for 30 people?  $40pp for all of that would be a STEAL.  Will the music be playing during this time?"

fiddlypoppin,whowouldwin,1390424573.0,"Everybody in this thread assumes GL can scare a kid with his constructs. That just doesn't sit right to me. Instilling fear is what yellow lanterns do and it's antithetical to the Green Lantern Corps -- even to Hal. He's used yellow rings before, and has been possessed by Parallax more than once, so he knows what to do but I really don't think his ring is capable of that. 

Shock? Sure. Awe? Of course. Fear?  I doubt it. 

From my perspective as a father, too, I can tell you right now that Black Widow and Nick Fury would be a hell of a lot scarier than Superman or Wonder Woman to a little kid. They dress in dark clothing and their job involves intimidation. 

Here's how I see it:

*Heavy Hitters* -- 100% full canister

Batman and MM for the JL and Hulk for the Avengers. These guys would scare the shit out of kids right off the bat.

*Strong Contenders* -- 50%+ full canister

Superman and Wonder Woman for the JL and Black Widow, Nick Fury, and Iron Man for the Avengers. I can also see Thor in this level. 

These will really depend on what they can do to scare the kids. Superman *can* be scary, but he tries not to be, so he's not very good at it. Wonder Woman is a warrior, and so some intimidating shouts or display of arms could possibly be enough, but it would have to make the kids scream instead of just shut up and stare. Black Widow and Nick Fury handle interrogation and intimidation on a regular basis and I think they can make the kids scream pretty easily. Thor could probably startle a scream out with thunder and lightning. Iron Man would be trickier, but he could possibly handle some kind of audio-visual projection that could startle/scare the kids. 

*Normal Joes* -- 0%+ full canister

Everyone else is down here. Captain America isn't scary. Hawkeye isn't scary. Aquaman isn't scary. OMG, The Flash is anything but scary. They could still pull something out of their bag of tricks, but I doubt any of them will fill a canister. 


All put together, it would probably be something like this:

JL = 4-6 canisters (1 each from Batman and MM, 1-2 from Supes and WW, 1-2 from Flash, GL, and Aquaman together)

Avengers = 3.5-6 canisters (1 from Hulk, 2-4 from Black Widow, Nick Fury, Iron Man, and Thor, and .5-1 from Hawkeye and Cap)

I really think it's pretty close for both teams and could go either way. I'd give JL a narrow lead, but Avengers have enough strong contenders that it could easily push them over the top. It's really going to come down to that middle group and/or some dumb luck from the weaker scarers on both teams.

The question is are we going to treat all the political groups this way? MRA/TRP is the standout on this one - BH has at least one regular there who is a vocal supporter who's gotten Kill on Sight downvotes in the past for it. We'd need to steer clear around a lot of the TiA and Occupy trash that we see, and even some of the atheist stuff. Even the State's Rights positions have earnest and modern political positions because it is an actual political ideal. The only one left are the Nazis, and if taking this rule seriously, it's more an exception to prove this.

I don't mean this as a slippery slope, but that BH will lose a lot of its authority if it puts Libertarian - although, speaking as someone who also probably falls within the selfsame broad category of Libertarian as you, I don't necessarily want to stick much neck out to defend reddit's varietal of Anarcho-Capitalist - protected status.

aqouta,leagueoflegends,1390424891.0,Honestly Dota has a completely different designs philosophy. Comparing the two doesn't really make sense. I've given Dota 100 games and simply cannot stand the feel of the game. It's not harder it's just nuanced. It's more tactical but also slower paced. From level 1 in league you're casting tons of spells and have a lot more interaction with your Lane opponent. In Dota you have a tiny mana pool and thus your interactions are more limited. It's arguable that those interactions are more meaningful but it still feels like I'm doing a chore (csing and denying)  waiting between my trades. In my opinion the added nuances in dota don't make the game better just more complicated. I'd prefer league not copy their philosophy.

I try to save up holy power for a Light of Dawn, and pre-cast a Holy Radiance when I can - is there anything else I can do?

The language will stay intact no matter how people decide to communicate, because if they're communicating they're understanding each other, which means the language must still be intelligible. Linguistic change is nothing to be afraid of: over hundreds of thousands of years of unrestricted evolution, language always has and always will ""work.""

Ha, hat is a great way of putting it about the controversial questions! There is just no good easy answer to some things. 

I find your view on putting up the profile before the photos interesting. I tend to look at people more than once to check my first impression just in case something weird skewed my opinion. I do prefer to write my profile elsewhere first. Think about it and edit it before posting.  
I agree with you view on pictures, it is great to have a range and action shots are such great conversation starters. I remember one guy had an action shot where he was covered in mud and I was just so curious I had to ask what the story was. These shots also help to show you are a real person behind the technology.

Honesty is the best policy. Definitely it is not good to omit things like being a game because that can be a big area in your life and really change someone’s view about you.  I do think it is important to focus on what your target market might want to hear though. Like I don’t spend much time talking about my crafty hobbies, I mention them but then move on to what might be more interesting to a man. 
I actually find it a little weird how much people talk about their families… maybe it’s because I don’t have a good relationship with mine.  Also yah for avatar! I would love if a guy had common interests like that. I agree giving examples is a good idea. My biggest complaint with a lot of profiles is they are just so vague. Everyone likes fun and music and beaches etc. I agree I dislike the thing you can’t live without section.  It rarely adds anything to the profile. 

Damn, I wish you remembered what it was! I have left it blank and I have tried various witty options but it never seems to affect things either way.

I find your view on speed interesting. I always take a lot of time to consider each person. Hmm maybe I have too much time on my hands!  I tend to limit my searches by my big deal breakers like smoking and drugs. Most of my other dealbreakers often don’t get mentioned on a profile so I have to wait till later to find out.  I once met someone just because I thought he was hot. It was a disaster. I agree that it’s important to feel that ‘wow I’m excited to meet this person’ feeling (which is exactly why I don’t get why people don’t put info on their profiles, how can I know this if you don’t tell me anything?)
I love the idea of giving advice about food etc, that gives me either the opportunity to follow it and tell you after or to suggest we go there on a date! Tres smooth. I also follow the open ended question method… I want to give the person a reason to write back! 
Thank for you this! Very interesting! Perhaps you should write a book.

P.S. now I am craving tacos.

This is what I was talking about - sorry if it comes across weird, I haven't linked on reddit before. I get that your friends are saying one thing, but you came to reddit for new opinions, right? I'm not an expert, or anything, just another opinion, so definitely feel free to take it with a grain of salt. 

Honestly, I think this whole idea about ""building a friendship"" with someone you *already know* you want to date stems from a fear of rejection, or insecurity. It's easier to wait, and pine after the person, and tell yourself you're just trying to be friends first than to face that moment where the chips are down and you're waiting for a ""yes"" or a ""no"". 

Let me ask you this: what, exactly, are the benefits of letting things build slowly? Your friends must have given you a reason that it's better to wait, right? I've already outlined a lot of the cons to it - misleading her about your intentions, her getting asked out by someone else in the meantime, months of emotional investment in someone who you don't even know returns your feelings, and a barrier to you getting out there and finding someone who *does* return your feelings if she doesn't.

Although the IVF clinic had a sheet of estimated prices, those turned out to have nothing to do with our actual paid balance.

We were not told until we had started the cycle that these costs did not include medications.

When we were working through the second cycle, we were told that my lifetime maximum had been exhausted, and we owed $6000.  And the bills have just kept coming.  $200 here, $500 there.  Every few weeks we get another bill.  We are seldom told what the bills are for, what they relate to, or why they weren't covered in that $6000.

maynardftw,AskReddit,1390425259.0,"It was for one of mine, at least.

Had a friend I'd known all through high school, we'd gotten closer after we graduated. Hung out all the time, but eventually he got busy with college and then work and we'd still hang out every now and then but it was always with other friends he'd gotten through college.

He'd never had a girlfriend in his entire life, so it was a pretty big deal when he finally got one. Or at least, it should've been; he didn't introduce us or mention her when we hung out. Apparently their (Asian) parents had set them up together and they just went with it. So I figure, okay, maybe he's not taking the relationship that seriously, so it'd make sense he wouldn't want to make that big a deal of it with his friends.

Welp, after a while they move in together. Which is a big deal, because he'd been living with his parents until then. Can I get an invite? House warming? Who is this person who's suddenly become a large part of your life, what's she like, what're her interests, what do you like or dislike about her? Nothing. It's around this point we stop talking as often on Facebook. We don't really hang out anymore. It's okay, I think - sometimes people grow apart temporarily due to life, but there's nothing keeping us from suddenly hanging out again if the opportunity should present itself. He's not mad at me or anything, after all.

I'd been hanging out with another, mutual friend from high school group for a while now. Our friend comes up as a topic every now and then, mostly about how he seems to have withdrawn from everyone. Doesn't respond on Facebook hardly ever anymore.

Then it happens. They get engaged. Neither of us got a message, ""Hey man, I'm gonna ask her to marry me, I'm pretty nervous"", nothing. I had to find out through him changing his relationship status.

Some time goes by, they get married. Neither of us were invited. Maybe it was a small event, not a big deal, just the family? No. There was a Facebook photo album of wedding pictures. Friends he'd made in college lifting him and his wife above their heads.

That was more or less it, really. For having been as close as we were, to be so completely snubbed, it's hard to come back from that. Before, we were just drifting - a thing which can be recovered from - but now there is, effectively, an insult. You aren't good enough to talk to about my relationship - not good enough to meet my fiancee - not good enough to see my first place - not good enough to come to my wedding.

So I got drunk and went through the wedding album, saying goodbye to our friendship with every drink, apparently long after he'd already done so."

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1390425300.0,"Baldwin and Tate are clearly two very talented guys. I think Baldwin is of the better slot receivers and Tate's YAC ability is elite going off of relativism. But they both need a big body, a true number one or other factors so that they can routinely get 1 one 1 match ups instead of having a safety cheat to their side and essentially take them out of the play. Also, our intermediate passing game was thrown off a lot because of our offensive line. Ultimately, our offense goes as the offensive line goes. I mean, sure, we've gotten a lot of yards from Russell scrambling once the pocket collapsed, and once Russ feels more confident throwing into tighter areas (he's accurate enough but he's been very hesitant during the play offs and I think the coaching staff wants that during the play offs). 

EDIT: Doug Baldwin was pursued by a lot of teams over the off season last year. I'm sure with the loss of Welker, NE considered him. I truly wonder how he would have done there because a lot more passes would have come his way given NE's offense and Brady like slot receivers.

Because you're going into the moment not knowing that it is nonsensical. If you think back to when you were a kid, you probably did stupid things, but back then you didn't think that they were nonsensical, because back then you had what you believed to be a completely logical path to your actions.

I'm staying at a friend's place right now and looking for a place in the city so I can offer my perspective. If you're getting your own apartment you'll need good credit. I got denied from a place in the international district (one of the cheapest neighborhoods) that was $450 for rent. I don't even have bad credit, just not enough of it (5 months of owning a credit card and paying it off in full every month). It seems like most places require proof of income so it will be important to get a job up here ASAP.

If you're getting a roomshare you won't need credit but you'll need much more money upfront. Most places (on CL at least) require first and last month's rent, plus a deposit. So you're looking at at least $1500 upfront just for a decent bedroom.

After some hunting around on the internet, I've discovered that the protocol that clinic uses has fallen out of favor for women with diminished ovarian reserve.  We are now looking around for a new RE who will be willing to try different protocols.  Our previous RE isn't willing to, and her only suggestion for proceeding is donor eggs.

Donor eggs are another issue.  I'm Asian-American, and the egg bank my first RE works with is mostly located on the East Coast.  They recruit women from Seattle, Florida, Boston, and North Carolina.  Other than Seattle, there are no Asian-American populations to speak of in those places.  Now that we know donor eggs are going to be part of the roadmap, we are also looking for an RE whose egg bank is in a network with a higher Asian population."

But having an unelected urbanite council to replace corruption and disenfranchise the rest isn't a solution either.

The solution is to stop being so fucking corrupt, Thailand. All Thais think they know better than everyone else, so in their eyes, the corrupt but elected government is probably bad for all the population, which may be true. But then they also assume that just having a politically unaffiliated council to make decisions for the country will also have the best interests of all the country at heart, and knows best about what's best for those uneducated poor farmers.

Rhinowarlord,DnD,1390425421.0,"The level 1 pregens in the newest packet say this:

&gt;Melee Attack (Two-Weapon Fighting): Scimitar (+4 to hit;
1d6 + 3 slashing) and scimitar (+4 to hit; 1d6 slashing)

So you have: 

Attack (MH and OH): d20 +3 (using dex instead of str because of the scimitar's finese property) and +1 (proficiency with scimitars) for the attack, totaling 1d20 + 4 for both the main and off hand attacks, which are rolled separately.

Damage (MH): 1d6 +3 (adding dex instead of str because of the finesse property again) for your main hand attack.

Damage (OH): 1d6 for offhand (which you don't add str or dex to as per the dual wield rules, unless you get the two weapon fighting fighting style from your class).

You add proficiency to any d20 roll you are proficient in, such as skill checks, attack rolls (using weapons you're proficient with), and all saving throws (but not necessarily checks) using certain attributes. The exception is spell save DCs, which you add your proficiency bonus to (under certain circumstances). Armor/shield proficiency only stops you from taking penalties.

For example, if you were a fighter, and had proficiency with str and con saving throws, and athletics, you would add your proficiency bonus to saves (as well as your base modifier) to resist the entangle spell (which is vs. strength), but you wouldn't add your proficiency to a check to flip over a table, because that's a check, not a save. But if you were to do a strength (athletics) check to jump over a table, you would add both your modifier and proficiency bonus, because you're proficient with athletics. 

The rule of thumb for saves vs. checks is that saves are passive, or reflexive, while checks represent you actively attempting to achieve something."

jianadaren1,todayilearned,1390425569.0,"&gt;Can you give more examples of sexist/racist stereotypes that have excellent evidence to support them?

I'd rather not, because they tend to be inflammatory even if true.

&gt;I'm trying figure out why, if evidence shows that women are worse at math than men, it's sexist. Isn't only sexist if someone says/believes, ""Women are worse at math than men, so that makes them inferior to men.""?

I think the problem lies with the identification of causality. Yes, women do worse in math but it's unclear exactly why that is. It's possible that there are no biological differences in capacity for math and that the gap could be entirely explained by social factors (women are discouraged from math, for example). In that case, it would be sexist to ascribe women's poor results in math to their femaleness per se, because it wouldn't be their sex, but rather the treatment received because of their sex that causes the discrepancy.

Fundamentally though, there's been a paradigm shift (that hasn't necessarily been accepted by everyone). It used to be that if there was an observable difference, we'd assume that the difference was inherent until proven otherwise (e.g. women do worse at math, so I'll suppose that women are inherently worse at math until I'm proven otherwise). Now we assume that all people are equal and that any discrepancies are assumed to have social causes until we can prove that there's an inherent difference (e.g. women do worse at math, I'll suppose that there's no inherent difference between the sexes and assume that women are socialized differently and so do worse at math).

Basically we've acquired null hypothesis that all people are inherently equal and so any observed discrepancy is assumed to have no relationship to race or sex, unless proven otherwise.

Edit: Nobody seems willing to accept that nature and nurture are both inherent to all things and that *some* discrepancies are inherent to socially unfortunate factors like race or sex. It should be obvious that any trait that has a genetic component *could* genuinely have an inherent racial or sexual discrepancy. Of course it's ignorant to say ""X group can't do this because Y"", but it's equally ignorant to be willfully blind or discourage inquiry into whether legitimate differences exist. 

The only field where it's acceptable to do this appears to be medicine: there it's still okay to analyze by sex/race. For example, it seems that [Asians are much more likely to have the SERT gene which predisposes to depression](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/09/the-depression-map-genes-culture-serotonin-and-a-side-of-pathogens/). Woe betide the researcher who finds that a gender or ethnic group is more likely to share a gene that predisposes them to something less neutral."

Ask them if there are any rebates on any of your medications!

I think the rebate was $10 per 75 IU, which doesn't sound like much, but would have added up to over $1200 for us.

Good luck!!!  You can totally do this.  You will make it through!  Just remember to go SLOW with the injections.  When we did Menopur, going slow made all the difference in the world.  The same was true for PIO.  Since Mr. Z had already gotten used to going slow for Menopur, he just went at the same rate for the PIO, and said it wasn't a problem injecting it at all.  I would also recommend using an ice pack for a few minutes on the areas you'll be injecting -- I used ice packs for PIO and it made them MUCH less intimidating!"

dianthe,dogs,1390425590.0,"&gt;Your dog doesn't even have to bark to drive them nuts (depending on what kind of crazy they are), the fact your dog is even in the yard can annoy them, you're walking your dog and it can be a problem. There was a nutter at a bus station I walked my dog by once and the guy went BANANAS on me. She greeted a couple nice people at the stop that had gestured her over and just because she was then near him he flipped, starting calling her and I names, threatening us. The guy needed to be in the nut house. (My dog was a pup at the time, just had her second set of shots, so she wasn't scary and the guy was about 6'2...).

Had a similar story happen to me, just not quite as extreme. Was at a street fair with my dog who was like 10 months old at the time and is the sweetest thing. We were just standing there looking at one of the displays when this really snooty looking lady with two little girls came up. She then looks at Orion and declares ""Your dog is standing too close to my nieces!"" (the nieces didn't care by the way, so wasn't like he was scaring them). I was just dumbfounded and didn't even know what to say. She then grabbed her nieces and walked off while giving me a look.

Of course you don't have to forgive her. But put her out of your mind as not existing for you any more.

Some say that that's the whole point of forgiveness — that you do it to let go of the hate and move on — and although some people are indeed undeserving of forgiveness, you still need to find a way to put it behind you. 

The bastard in question who made you miserable back when ultimately wins when they are still changing how you think and live years later. That's all I'm saying.

Girl you look pretty fine  
at least most of the time,  
I got a real nice clue  
on how to get in with you.

On the 'net they call me ""alpha"",  
so I know I gotta look out for  
gold-diggin' bitches who just after my riches.  
And if you take it the wrong way, well, it don't ruin *my* day.

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

I hate that you won't be mine.

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

I don't see you as a person, but a pussy and a trophy combined.

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

If you don't wanna be with me,  
well that's fine.

Girl, I like the way your nose scrunch  
when you laugh and eat your big lunch.  
You're sexier than you look,  
and I think  
I saw your picture in a book,  
about  
sluts.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a slave to vagina  
I just get that your sluttiness is primal.  
I don't mean no disrespect  
but it's fair that I expect  
a smile and some titty  
when I treat you all shitty.

Some fem-in-ists ain't down-wit-this and they'll tell you that I'm scummy.  
But my ig-no-rance is just-a-twist on loneliness, so fuck me!

See I was just a nice guy  
who found a real crew,  
they took the red pill,  
and now I'm takin' it too.

We don't hate women, but we only trust bros.  
It's not *your* fault, you just got two X-chromosomes.  
You'll never love me like I could love you,  
but I ain't a martyr, I just accept the bio-truth.  

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

I hate that you won't be mine.  

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

I won't even give you the time.  

(*Girl, you so fine.*)  

If you don't wanna be with me,  
well that's fine.

A'right bitchy lady, walk away if you must,  
all I tried to do was compliment your bust.  
It's all your problem and not slightly mine,  
if I gotta alienate  
half of the human race  
to get laid  
well, that's fine.

(*Girl, you so fine.*) x5

Imagine you listen to death metal, and someone comes up to you and tells you that they're metalhead-platonic: They don't really like death metal and actually would never listen to it but their relationship to their music is, somehow, inexplicably 'deep' in the same way that your relationship to death metal is, and how dare you suggest that you're a metalhead unless you claim that they're metalheads too?  Oh, and by the way, they're now activists for death metal and ought to be treated as such.

bunker_man,AskReddit,1390425719.0,"&gt; But seriously, if God exists, then why not two Gods? Or four?

Not really a traditional theist, but this logic is questionable anyways. The entire point of God as a first inherent source of reality is that it cannot be differentiated. If there were two of some kind of ""god"" then the logic of monotheism is that the differentiation was caused by a higher order of differentiation of which there was less of. And that ultimately this all would have to come from one source, and so one ""true"" god. Even monotheists already believe in multiple god-like things. Their point is that only the most supreme one counts as the god. This is really more of an advancement in philosophy than it is a religious thing. If there were multiple gods, it would kind of contradict its own point.

The other issue is that forms of polytheism are seen as more emenationist by this same logic. God is then a ""role"" rather than an entity. So if there are multiple ""gods"" each are seen as a part of the primary ""principle"" rather than as each being an individual god."

hopewings,waiting_to_try,1390425825.0,"Many hugs to you, Vallaria, and I'm sorry to hear that you are struggling right now.

I can't tell you that the money situation is going to magically solve itself, but a healthy baby in your arms is worth it.  No, the next baby won't replace your lost baby, and no, it won't be a ""clean slate,"" but so what?  You will love that baby, cherish that baby, and try so hard to be a great parent, because you have loved and lost!

When we lost Liam, my husband was still in grad school and making very little, and we owed over a thousand dollars in hospital bills.  We weren't even ""ready"" to have a baby then, since we were living in a one bedroom apartment and didn't even have a nursery.  But we saved up.  Money can always be made.  People go into debt all the time for less worthwhile things, mere objects of fancy.  A baby is worth it.

You don't need to be in some perfect financial state, some perfect emotional state, or some perfect physical state to have a healthy baby.  I sure wasn't when we had our second little boy.  I was an emotional wreck that entire year, and even after I got pregnant, I was scared and nervous the whole time.  We all were.

Now, I can tell you that when I was holding our little healthy baby boy in my arms, seeing this little life who graced our lives, and watching him grow... he has brought us so much joy and love.  My heart no longer aches so heavily, my arms no longer feel so empty, and my thoughts are no longer so dark.  That brighter future will come for you, too.  You can and will get through this.  You can and will have another baby, a healthy baby, who will give you lots more feelings of guilt and doubt as a parent, but it will be mixed with such wonderful times and sweet laughter.

No, you won't forget your little girl Zoe.  You won't replace her.  You will have a little sibling for her, and maybe another sibling after that.  And your family will be a loving one.  Even though it is one member less than it is supposed to be, you will always have a place for her in your hearts."

soitcause,changemyview,1390425871.0,"&gt;Oh yes I have and the contempt was not comparable.

I'd argue that they can be. This all depends on the community, of course, some are much better than others. I play a game where people are regularly told they are worthless human beings, that they should kill themselves or that they're gay in the euphemism of the week. It's pretty dehumanizing to listen to people *say* that stuff (this is over voice chat so no banhammer), and after a few minutes of figuring you out based on how you react the comments only get worse. This is, of course, a pretty extreme example, but I doubt it's the only one. Admittedly, girl gamers have it worse, but it's typically either because they're not good and got carried to their rating by guy friends (not all girls mind you) or the flamer is taking advantage of the fact that there's one more dimension on which to degrade her. But when people find out I'm black, the rest of the game is nigganigganigga, so I think it's more a matter of low-hanging fruit than specific hatred toward women. Equal opportunity bigotry, if you wanna put it that way.

&gt; I am just saying that women get an unfair deal, both online and in person, and I think the phenomena are related, so I don't take online anonymous misogyny lightly as just an effect of online anonymity. It's a matter of looking into hate crimes women are a victim of that men are not...

I mean, I agree that they get the short end of the stick. But so does pretty much any group that can be viewed as a minority. There are slurs for Bronies, even. That said, the only group who seems to be shocked and appalled at this behavior is women. 


I'm not saying women should like it, or that they should put up with offensive behavior, it's just... it seems as if there's some sense of willful ignorance going on. It bothers me that people are seemingly (and I want to emphasize this because I don't know what goes through other people's minds) setting themselves up to be upset, and that bothers me perhaps even more than immature fucks who get a kick out of flaming people online."

I have traveled to 7 countries around the world, i also happen to be a yoga practitioner, am prob one of the nicest persons youl ever meet, i am a natural extrovert and i consider myself FAR from ignorant.

Now i fail to understand your point of view of entropy as a life reason, however if we take entropy from information theory, then i would have to agree that there are an infinite number of variables that can happen to me as long as i live, this accounts for that 25% of me not killing myself, my curiosity as to what will life bring about in the future is what keeps me going, however as i fall into the routine of society and becoming ever more part of the ""system"" that i live in, i find myself disillusioned with how our modern society believes, does and expects, i find myself not wanting to be part of said system, and in a globalized world is hard to find a place to not be part of that system at all.

Hopefully this made some sense to you.

I care less about the politics of this and more about the human aspect. Versailles partly explains but doesn't justify support for Nazi actions, just like the Armenian political agenda now doesn't justify hateful reactions and ignorance on just what happened in 1915.

DrTheSteve,DnD,1390426044.0,"My group and I fought one a couple of months ago and it was nasty.


The setting: temple in the forest. The inside is dark, only characters with infravision could see any good distance.  There were a few torches on the walls, enough to see four pools (maybe 3x4 squares) of water in each corner of the square room. There were two lines of hard to find traps between each set of pools, front two and back two, that would pin the unlucky to the floor until they removed the spike in their foot.  At the far end we found a green dragon in an alcove and an elf.


How it went down: Not knowing which was which, our over-zealous monk attacked the dragon, but was blocked by a firewall from the elf.  She didn't care and ran through the fire and hit the dragon, only to discover it was a statue.  As this happened the real dragon coiled out of one of the front pools of water and pulled our fighter underwater, 60ft down. Shit.  We forgot that green dragons have waterbreathing.  Everyone jumped into the water, not what our DM expected.  Our rangers, not being stupid enough to fight a waterbreathing dragon underwater stayed up top, killed the elf
 (just a simulacrum), disarmed the traps, and waited for the dragon to come up.  After ripping our cleric to pieces (for some reason he thinks he's a tank) our monk hit him for somewhere in the neighborhood of 100 dmg in one round. The dragon fled up and the rangers were ready, the first hitting each shot with bolts and the second hitting the bolts in deeper with thrown magic pots and pans (he's a c ooky prospector), killing the dragon.


Cleric died, but it was his own dumb fault. Anyway, have the dragon draw the party into the water and unless they're expecting that it should be a tough fight."

It's invasive, and creates an overwhelming feeling of shame. Terminating an unplanned pregnancy can also be 'playing roulette' with your future ability to reproduce - complications or a botched job may render her unable to carry to term in the future.

Why don't you go and get a vasectomy? If you think that's invasive, expensive, and may endanger your eventual ability to have children, now you know how women feel about varying forms of BC, and that doesn't even alter your hormone levels.

You sound too immature to be in a long term relationship. It's not about you getting your rocks off - it's about forming a mutually beneficial partnership with another human being.

In FFT, we're led to believe that St. Ajora was a man who sacrificed himself during the original Zodiac Brave conflict, and served as the leader of the Braves. At some point, the original Zodiac Braves (who had somehow inherited Auracite, which were the Zodiac Stones) in their final battle destroyed all airships (and, it is inferred, all non-Hume races aside from some exceptions). The ending of FFT suggests that St. Ajora's involvement in the Zodiac Brave Story is a fabrication of the Glabados Church.

FFXII gives us a very different story: St. Ajora is a female. Skyships are everywhere, despite worship of St. Ajora having been around for 2,000 years already (FFT's history says that Tactics takes place about 1200 years after the Zodiac Brave Story and St. Ajora's alleged death, so there's at least 600 years of unaccounted time and as much as 3200 years ... or more, I guess). Auracite doesn't even appear until FFXII: Revenant Wings, so the only real information we have is that the Glabados Church has *really* doctored history up pretty badly and we've got zero clue as to when what happened. We can only assume that the Zodiac Brave Story hasn't occurred yet and that St. Ajora had nothing to do with it at all. We can infer that the Zodiac Braves, whoever they were, *were* the ones responsible for the death of skyships and a few mass extinctions, but we don't know how. The game(s) in-between the two never got to that point. In Revenant Wings, we see the introduction of Auracite (and it is confirmed in the War of the Lions' new translation that the Zodiac Stones were Auracite). By FFTA2, airships no longer fly but non-Hume races are still plentiful, so there may have been two cataclysms between FFXII and FFT.

**end spoilers**

So uh... that's Ivalice. I *don't* think any game will fill in the gap in our knowledge of Ivalice history unless Square-Enix releases a new game. More than likely, it sounds like Matsuno wants to take this concept of history being manipulated by victors (a major theme across the Ivalice games) and applying it to a completely new world altogether."

This off-season, the only thing I can muster up is apathy. I don't care, not even a little. I'm not mad like most Browns fans, I'm not taking to reddit or twitter or the local sports blogs to vent and chastise the front office. I'm not even sad like some of us, who just want to be relevant. I'm completely nonplussed. I'm Jay Cutler. Whatever this new front office does in the off-season is of no consequence to me. These Browns haven't fielded a competitive team in nearly a decade, which with the ""parity"" in the NFL is a feat in and of itself. 

I didn't go to any games last season, and I only went to one the season before that because I won free tickets. I won't go to any games this season either. I won't buy a jersey, I won't give my hard-earned money to an organization that is disheveled at best and completely incompetent at worst. 

That's not to say I'm going to stop being a Browns fan. They'll always be my team, and I will still watch every play, but I'll be doing so in sixty-five inches of HD glory from the comfort of my recliner. 

The last decade of the Browns has been like a delinquent child. You still love the kid unconditionally, but you have to send him to military school to learn some goddamn discipline. You don't really *like* him as a person anymore, and you just hope that he can clean his act up and make a decent life for himself. Maybe he can change, and can grow up into a man that you can respect, maybe not. No matter what, you'll always love him, but tough love is necessary sometimes.

&gt;It's society, our ancestors, who fought for the right to have that word abolished completely



I know of no such abolition or specific movement to abolish the word.




&gt;Millions have died to fight the very existence of that word.


Massive, misleading hyperbole. People have fought for their civil rights, and one of those civil rights is free speech.



&gt;It's up to us as individuals to uphold what these past societies fought generations against; slavery, racism, inequality.


I am against all of these things. The act itself of saying the word is not racist, but I think that's the crux of our argument.



&gt;If you argued in logic, you would never compare the context of how it's used or the N word and the word pen. Those comparisons are grounded in logical fallacies.


While I acknowledge the slippery slope of jumping to thought crime, you have not pointed out other fallacies, especially given that *taking out* context is not what you do when you want to make a well-founded, logical argument.



To conclude, I do think ""long and hard about using that word at all,"" but I'm also going to defend the right of other people to say whatever the fuck they want, whether it offends you, or Marty, the President, or the Pope.

*  Photography = 24%
*  Wedding attire = 5% (includes my dress, accessories, hair and make up.  He already owns his suit)
*  Floral = 4% (5 bouquets, 8 center pieces, 8 boutonnieres, 1 corsage)
*  Music = 0 (we're doing an iPod)
*  Invites = ~1% (we haven't purchased these yet)
*  Misc = The last ~15% is going to linen rentals, decor, gifts for wedding party and parents (11 people + 1 set of parents, it's 4 BM, 4 GM, 1 officiant that's our friend, 2 DOCs), cake (if our friends don't bake for us, which is what I want.

redqueentopawnfour,MakeupAddicts,1390426481.0,"Cindy Lou is a pretty color but still too warm of a pink (if that makes sense) at least according to swatches online; I was looking for something more blue-based pink. My nearest Sephoras within 100 miles are all JCP's and NEVER have anything I want to swatch in store. I'm pretty sure they know me by name at my local one...

So Shiseido is noticable IRL? I was worried from all the reviews that it would be *too* subtle, like one of those products you're not entirely sure that you're wearing but people give you compliments (which would be nice...but I *do* want something I'm sure I'm wearing). Does it have any gold shimmer or is it just a pure white glow? It's relatively unknown so there aren't many online reviews for me to pore over. 

I've looked into the Becca as well. It does look nice, but I actually also just ran out of the Clinique Up-Lighting Liquid Illuminator and though I did enjoy it, I very rarely wore it on my face and mainly mixed it in with my lotions and used it on my chest, arms and legs. I don't mind the liquid per say but when I'm in a hurry I want to be able to grab a powder.

I looked at the MAC Lustre Drops in Pink Rebel as well, but again, I have to pause at the liquid. I may end up changing my mind on the liquid thing though if I don't settle on anything else because I do think both the Lustre Drops and Moonstone are very pretty.

Thanks for the input!

A couple times I misclicked (once realized after I clicked I fucked up, once actually just clumsily clicked on the wrong arrow).  The second was at the second-to-last move of one of the later levels, and was a small point of frustration.  I realize keeping a long train of undo is annoying to code, but I think just one move deep would be worth the code.

And the advice: I really liked the level counter.  If you do expand it, I would say do so in ""Worlds"" or ""Level packs"" or some such - the knowledge that there were only 15 levels kept me from clicking off elsewhere thinking ""If I don't leave now I'm gonna get stuck here for hours"".  Level packs/worlds would retain that, while giving me something to come back to.

Anyway, I'm on your list.  Keep it up, it's fun, and you're a small kick to get working on my own small projects :)"

FatBird17,IAmA,1390426614.0,"Hey Mark,

My brother is in acting school and unavailable right now, so I'm asking questions on his behalf that I think he might want to ask:
1. What freedoms do you enjoy about voice acting that you can't get in theatere or live-action film work? You've had a great voice acting career, so I imagine that there must be something you really love about the medium.
2. Do you have any advice for getting into the voice acting world right now? My brother, Kyle, has a great voice and character range and he's talked several times about wanting to do that, and I feel like there are so many opportunities now in games, television, and other venues to do voice acting work. What does it look like to even start in the video game voice acting world?

And I know you hear this from just about everyone you talk to, but I absolutely love your work as the Joker. You bring an inner life to that character that I don't imagine could be done by anyone else. Watching Kyle play through the first two Batman games, every time Joker came on screen I knew some magic was about to happen. Bravo, sir.

bored_criminologist,AdviceAnimals,1390426640.0,"""… West said he is dreading explaining the incident to his daughter, whose name is “North”, because it will lead to seriously negative discussions about American culture, society and history. West said he would prefer to leave the U.S. than have to have regular conversations about racism with his daughter. Sources told Hollywood Life that after the physical confrontation, West “just held” his daughter, “held her tight and told her how much he loves her. He told me man to man ’you know I’m dreading the day I’ve got to break this sht down to North and tell my little girl how fucked up the world is. I don’t ever want her to go through what her mother did today.’” West said further, “we’ve got enough money to buy our own island or some shit. I’ll be damned if I raise my daughter around ignorance and flat-out blatant racism.”

It's like no one even bothered to read what he actually said. I know we all like to hate Kanye, but damn sometimes we're hating the idea of him being a douche more than his actual actions. Any and everything he does no matter justified or not is just another part of the story of an egotistical douche.

Yasuo's Ult works with Cho's Q. Hence the pick.

Nothing about the meta has proven to be the most consistently effective method for playing the game. It is the only consistent method. But it hasn't proven better than any alternative, because there is no alternative that the community is comfortable enough to explore. Once teambuilder is released I'm really excited to see how the game will change.

I'm a junior right now at Baylor University working toward an accounting degree. I have a 3.7 GPA and am involved in multiple extracurriculars. I grew up on the west coast and want to go back there after school, both to earn my MACC and start working. I'd prefer the bay area or Seattle, probably in that order. 

So, internships...my school goes through recruiting for internships this spring, and those are worked in spring 2015 (so I'll be recruiting this semester). It's general practice for accounting majors here to do their undergrad, intern the second semester senior year, finish off the masters degree at Baylor the following year, and then begin work. I've seen some posts of people at the same point in time as me, yet they have a public accounting internship lined up for this summer. Am I behind? I've talked to recruiters on the west coast before, and they said, if I were to intern for them, it wouldn't be till summer 2015

As for my masters, do you have any suggestions for top schools? I've heard about USC, Santa Clara, and U of Washington, to name a few. Does that sound right? (Money isn't a limiting factor.) Would public firms' recruiters, in Texas, be willing to work with me if I told them I wanted to both work on the west coast and finish my masters out there as well?

aprildh08,TheBluePill,1390427038.0,"1. Introversion isn't social awkardness. I don't want to lecture you or anything, but seriously. You can be an outgoing introvert, I promise. All introversion is is the need to be alone or have down time to recharge during. Where extroverted people gather energy from going out and being around people, introverts tend to isolate themselves when they need to gather energy. That's really the only main difference. Of course, you can be introverted and socially awkward, but you can also be extroverted and socially awkward.

2. Not to invalidate your experience, but that's actually a really common occurrence for people, especially women. Nerds can be a very exclusionary group, unfortunately, and I think they're currently overreacting against a lot of people because it's ""in vogue"" to claim to be a nerd without doing the legwork, which for some reason offends them. A lot of people who identify as nerds have a background of being ridiculed for their interests, so they're less accepting of people who didn't have that experience who now claim the title of nerd. It's really dumb, but it's not a universal thing, I promise. There are still nerds out there who don't have protractor-measuring contests.

Basically what it boils down to is: if you identify as a nerd, you have the right to identify as a nerd. If you would rather not identify as a nerd, you have the right to not identify as a nerd, but that doesn't mean people won't still call you that. Especially if you wear glasses...

Are you picking people that would be likely to write back though? When I do write to someone first I look at their profile and try to figure out what kind of person they and if I would be the kind of person they would want to date.
That is kind of impressed you actually calculated your response rate!  But even if it is low, isn't it better to get that one response from someone who is really interested in you and what you have to say than a bunch of nothing responses just because you wrote hey?
Goodness, I hope you didn't read it all, this has taken me nearly all afternoon! Yes I don't feel attraction to a photo, I feel interest in cool, interesting, intelligent, well thought out profiles and messages.  Once a repartee is established I start thinking about how cute they are and then start getting a few butterflies at the thought of meeting someone who has had so many interesting things to say.  
Yes my mom thinks  I am an idiot for using online dating, but I rarely do what my mom says lol.  I have little optimism about it but I try anyways.
My expectations definitely are high, but if someone writes a thought out message I will always reply! If I wasn't concerned about privacy I would let people see my inbox to prove it.

Both too much and too little are a bad idea, but with processed foods, few people get too little. Ramen noodles? Soda? Canned anything? Bread? Yes, they all contain salt. And yes, it is amazing how much is being thrown at a person. Most Americans' diets contain many or all of these things. But they are the ones that likely don't care.

The new evidence seems to mainly be about people who are at risk for cardiovascular disease and are being told that 1,500 is their max. The AHA recommends this number for the general population.

Meanwhile, the Institute of Medicine now recommends 1,500 as the *minimum,* even for people to whom low sodium diets are being recommended due to disease. 

Looking at this, the number 1,800 doesn't seem too bad, actually.

But yeah, these two prominent health organizations (IoM, AHA) are not really aligned in their recommendations.

That excessive salt intake has negative health effects is not controversial, but the recommended amount is.

[Here](http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2013/Sodium-Intake-in-Populations-Assessment-of-Evidence/Report-Brief051413.aspx?page=1) is the recent IoM report.

A more recent study was done in 2011. I think the Italian one was 2007 or 2008. I believe this 2011 study instigated the re-evaluation by the CDC and IoM (and perhaps among other things).

2011, Compared with baseline sodium excretion of 4 to 5.99 g per day, sodium excretion of greater than 7 g per day was associated with an increased risk of all cardiovascular (CV) events, and a sodium excretion of less than 3 g per day was associated with increased risk of CV mortality and hospitalization for Congestive Heart Failur (CHF)

- Install cameras. There's some that you can link to your phone so you can monitor it when you're away. 

If you don't want to or can't afford cameras, you can buy those signs that say you have an alarm and security cameras. Even if they aren't *real*, it can deter people enough that they won't risk it.

Just wanted to clarify here. Gender Identity is the thing that remains (relatively constant), but transition changes the person's appearance, etc. 

But yeah, I've heard a lot of that, that women tend to be talked over more in the work force. Part of it is that female voices can be a bit less demanding, so they command less authority and confidence than a female voice, and also social pressures."

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1390427378.0,"The risks and side effects I'm not willing to accept are: expulsion (5-10% risk), perforation (1 in 1000, higher in me because I have a retroverted uterus), heavier periods (about 50% heavier on average), spotting for up to six months, and increased cramping (40% risk).

The copper IUD has a failure rate of 0.8% the first year. Pulling out (with perfect use, which is how my bf does it) has a failure rate of 4% the first year. If I got pregnant, I would get an abortion. The total complication rate for first trimester abortion is about 2%.

So, the question becomes: is a 3% lower annual risk of needing an abortion worth having periods that are 1.5x heavier than normal, a 40% risk of cramps, six months of spotting, 5-10% risk of expulsion, and 0.1% risk of perforation? Well compare that to the annual risk of needing an abortion, and that abortion having some kind of short or long term complication, which is 4% times 2%, i.e. 0.08% or 8 in 10 thousand women. Even if I was totally fine with the heavier bleeding, spotting, cramps, and risk of expulsion, the risk of having any complications from a possible abortion is about the same as the risk of perforation from the IUD (which is a serious complication and requires surgical removal). 

So, now the question becomes: am I willing to have heavier periods, spotting, and the risk of cramps or expulsion for a 3% lower annual risk of having a completely complication-free abortion?

Now, at this point it becomes a subjective value judgment for each individual woman to make for herself (or with her partner's input). Abortions where I live are free and easily accessible. I have a supportive partner who would be there with me for the procedure. Neither of us have any ethical misgivings about abortion. And I don't anticipate having a negative emotional experience or long term regrets if I had an abortion. Therefore, for us, we opt to forego the extra 3% annual protection from pregnancy. We also opt to forego the extra 2% annual protection from pregnancy that a condom would offer. We accept the 4% annual risk of pregnancy from the pull out method. It is not ideal, since obviously my bf would prefer to cum inside me. But he would rather pull out (and accept the decrease in pleasure at orgasm) than use condoms. And he (and I) would rather pull out than deal with the side effects and risks of the copper IUD.

Our decision to forego condoms and the IUD has become even easier now that I have started tracking my cycles with the sympto-thermal method (includes daily body temperature and cervical mucous tracking). We are now transitioning to a hybrid pull-out and fertility awareness method. Basically, he will get to cum inside me on my non-fertile days, but will continue to pull out on my fertile days. Theoretically, this should not really increase annual risk of pregnancy above 4%, since we will use a very conservative estimate of my fertile window, and also because I have textbook perfect cycles (always 28 days exactly). And now he will get to cum inside me several times per month.

I hope the above risk-benefit analysis and illustration of our decision making process was somehow informative to you. Feel free to ask me any follow up questions if you like. "

The internet is an equalizer, but it's not enough of one yet to be the main platform through which people get their ideas.

steve496,49ers,1390427730.0,"Thing is, Adam Snyder was actually decent.  I mean, I wouldn't want him starting, but as depth, we could do a lot worse.  The big hole on the line is at C with Goodwin almost certainly gone.  My guess is we'll just plug in Kilgore or Looney; OLinemen take some time to develop - particularly at C with the need to do blocking assignments - so its unlikely a rookie is going to leapfrog them and claim the starting job.  Add to this the lack of top center prospects and our other needs, and I just don't see OL as a early-round need in this draft.

That said: I do think its something we should address in the middle rounds.  With Iupati, Snyder, and Kilgore being free agents next offseason, we're going to need a couple of competent replacements on the interior line, and drafting a mid-rounder to develop this year and giving them a year to develop strikes me as the best way to address that.

So, to summarize: I think WR and CB are our top priorities, with S joining them if Whitner leaves.  G/C is in the second tier, along with backup QB.  Pretty much all other positions I expect us to take primarily on the basis of who the best available player is."

And for most women, we aren't just looking for lot's of men to want to have sex with us either, we want something more than that which is rarer to find.

So they'd write made up numbers of straight time and overtime that averaged out to the pay per hour you were supposed to be getting. 

Junior didn't explain this violation when he hired me. Someone else mentioned it briefly but I didn't understand it. So I just ignored it and was happy with my large pay checks. Near the end of the summer when I was almost leaving the job to go back to school, Junior tells me he'd accidentally been over-paying me by $11/hr. I wasn't guilty in the slightest not only because he was breaking the law,
but also because he'd been signing the checks attached to the pay stubs - so he should have noticed.

Ostrololo,gamedesign,1390427884.0,"&gt; The obvious solution, to me, seems to just have the buffs last a certain number of actions. And have each debuff potentially run out at the start of each character's action.

That's the issue he's outlining—the rate characters can take actions is uneven, therefore the effective duration of buffs that last a set number of actions is uneven.

Suppose Alice the rogue, Bob the warrior and Charlie the wizard are fighting a dragon. Alice's very fast, so she takes actions twice as often as Bob. Charlie then casts a spell that grants each party member a fire-resistance boost for two turns (Charlie's speed is irrelevant in this example). So it goes like this:

1. Charlie takes an action, giving the fire shield buff to the party.

2. Alice takes an action and attacks the dragon.

3. Bob takes an action and attacks the dragon.

4. Alice takes an action and attacks the dragon. She has now taken two actions, so her defensive buff ends.

5. The dragon takes an action and uses a firebreathing attack. Alice's fire-resistance buff has ended, but Bob's is still up. Alice dies, Bob remains unscathed.

This is just *feels* wrong. Alice was punished for being too fast!

In Garin's system, characters still take turns to perform their actions, but there's a battle clock. So, Alice takes a turn every 2 seconds, while Bob takes a turn every 4, for example, and the fire-shield buff lasts 5 seconds. This fixes the previous issue, but increases the amount of clutter in the battle system."

I forgot to note this, but graves are put face down off to the side, while allies are put face up off to the side. I'll add that in.

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390428278.0,"&gt; Counting out the women who are against birth control is one thing but counting out women who cannot take it but want to be able to, is another.

What if I counted out women in a wheelchair because I want to be able to do things like rock climbing, running, and hiking with my partner?  She can't help that she has legs that don't work or none at all - maybe she has things she can do to allow her to do those things, but the cost and the amount of work it would take just to make someone else happy make it not worth it for her.  Would you think this is wrong, too?

The problem is those things that you say are different are not different.  He's not counting them out because they're reluctant and he only wants to be with people that are willing.  He's counting them out because there's a particular experience that he wants to enjoy with his partner, and these women, no matter how wonderful they are, cannot provide that experience.

In reality, this is the preference that is the *most* important to have to be agreed on by your partner.  Why?  Because you *cannot* get that anywhere else.  If sex with my partner isn't satisfying, then I can't just get it elsewhere.  So why should he sacrifice something like that?

I mean think about it - how many times do we tell people how sexual compatibility is important?  If these women are not sexually compatible with him, **regardless of the reason** then why should anyone, the women included, feel bad about it?

&gt;I would know that it was my fault if the connection were to end

And there's the biggest issue.  It's not your fault.  It's no one's fault.  If you didn't wrongly blame yourself, this wouldn't be an issue.

Some men really like the idea that they're the only person to have had sex with you. There can be various reasons behind this - possessiveness, insecurity about their own performance, or unfortunately, sexism as they believe a 'good' woman should have a 'low number or no sexual partners'. 

It sounds a bit like he just casually dated the other girls. He was probably fond of them, but it seems to be nothing compared to what he feels towards you.

PatHeist,buildapc,1390428443.0,"OK. Make sure you have a screwdriver that's as close as you can to the shape of the screw head. It really needs to fit in there snugly. If the screw head is damaged from previous attempts and looks something like this:

http://cdn.instructables.com/FDV/4I1N/H4AGDBU9/FDV4I1NH4AGDBU9.MEDIUM.jpg

Start with another screw. If you can put the screwdriver in the head of the screw and wiggle it a little, there might be too much of a difference between the screw driver tip and the screw head. Make sure the screwdriver isn't too pointy. If you have no other screwdrivers, place a rubber band over the head of the screw like so:

http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/18iy1cjme5vzgpng/ku-medium.png

Now, see if you can't find any pliers to hold on to the screwdriver firmly with. 

Proceed to lay the case down, with the screw facing upwards. Put the rubber band over the screw head if you need to, and grab the top of the screwdriver with your left hand. Now lean in over the screwdriver and place your right shoulder on your left hand, so you can transfer force down on the screw with your body. Don't push too hard, it's just to make sure the screwdriver doesn't hop when you turn it. If you have pliers to grab the screwdriver with, do that and hold the screwdriver with the pliers in such a way that the palm of your right hand is facing upwards, and your right elbow is pointing straight out to your right. If you don't have pliers, simply grab something like a washcloth or tshirt and make a strong fist around the screwdriver. Use your shoulder muscle to swing your right elbow upwards, in a counterclockwise motion such as to turn the screw. Make sure to carefully gauge how much pressure you need to apply downwards with your left hand/right shoulder to keep the screw driver from hopping. Do short multiple short turns and the screw should be loose in no time at all.

This will likely be overkill, but the technique should help you with any problematic screws you encounter in the future. The most important thing is to not strip the screw - use a rubber band or a washcloth between the screw and the screwdriver if the screwdriver is too small or too pointy."

&gt;Chemical or surgical abortion will cause more problems with your reproductive health than birth control will. 

Not true. First trimester abortion has a total compilation rate (short term and long term, major and minor) of 2%.

&gt;Like it or not tho, there ARE ethical issues with this procedure. 

For some people? Sure. Not for everyone. Not for me. Not for my bf. Those are the only two people's ethical concerns that would be relevant to me if I had to have an abortion.

&gt;I doubt seriously that you are just fine with late term or partial birth abortions. If you are, then you really are an asshole.

Wow, you really can't stop with the shaming and judginess, can you? I only have an ethical issue with late term abortions in the cases where women have them because they couldn't get access to an earlier abortion. My ethical problem with that is that the woman will be exposed to much higher risks because the medical community failed to provide her with an abortion in a timely manner. In practice, this is rare, because the vast majority of late term abortions are actually done because of fetal abnormalities, not because the woman couldn't access a first-trimester abortion. Partial birth abortions do not actually occur in any reputable clinics or hospitals. It doesn't make sense to do them, because there are technically superior ways of doing a third term pregnancy termination - i.e. Induced stillbirth (medication to induce intrauterine fetal demise and labour). This is also generally done in place of second trimester surgical abortions. This is how late term pregnancy terminations are actually  done in practice. And no, I don't have an ethical problem with it, except as stated above."

The school ended up having to release a statement saying that the boy was given detention because he was standing on a table in the school's cafeteria and shouting at the other students to get on their knees and pray (or something like that, the details are fuzzy), but in a way that suggested that he was just being an asshat for attention.

TheDarkHorse83,AskMen,1390428587.0,"&gt;my friendships have mainly consisted of hanging out and playing video games 

This is a pretty typical guy friendship. We tend to make friends by doing things together, playing video games, fishing, playing/watching sports. What are referred to as shoulder-to-shoulder relationships. This isn't a problem.

Don't worry about the whole ""I meet your friends, you meet mine"" thing, it's not that formal. It just means that you bring her to a typical social function with you, she brings you to one of hers. There's no rules and no formalities, it's just broadcasting the relationship to your social circle and letting your partner see what your social circle is like.

As someone who has very few friends, but a tight-knit family that works as a strong support network/social circle, that phase felt a little one-sided in our relationship, but she understood (better than I did) why my group of friends was so small. After a while of being together she pointed out that I've never felt the need for a lot of friends because my family filled whatever roles that I needed from a social group. I was floored by the revelation and thankful that I had found someone who understood me so well."

bunker_man,AskReddit,1390428801.0,"Pro: -I don't yell, or even really raise my voice.

-I don't get emotional, but am still good at empathizing.

-Will probably have a reasonable job in the future.

-Good at understanding and interacting with you.

-Not that I like self declaring this, but am known as being one of the funnier people anyone I know knows.

-Am fairly open ended to you getting your way.

-Like doing things for people.

-Very patient.


Con: -If you have major character flaws, I will generally assume we're in an open dialogue about solving them. I am also open to you doing the same for me. I assume that all interactions are team efforts to helping eachother not fall into bad habits, and self improvement, and if that's not your goal it may be annoying.

-If it's too hot I more or less act dead. This makes it difficult for me to do things outside in summer.

-Even if I let you have your way, I'm rarely going to pretend I'm admitting I was wrong if I wasn't. (Not autistic. Just intj.)

-I have a crazy sleep schedule. If I'm tired at the time we're supposed to do things I may act dead.

-For the current moment, I have an annoying medical issue that I talk about all the time. I'm not always like this, I swear, lol.

-I'm not ugly, but I wouldn't really say I'm that attractive.

Things that might be pros or cons?: -I am good at being insanely frugal for everything. While this is good to save money, you might be annoyed that I would get annoyed a the prospect of spending a bunch.

-I'm in between six foot three and six foot four. Take your pick on whether that's good or not."

alc6379,martialarts,1390428803.0,"First off, what kind of school is this? Is it the same style as what you earned your other belt in?

Second, that might be the goal, but individuals are different. We're adults. If somebody needs to take a drink during class, it's on that individual to make that determination, and do so without disrupting class. I could see if you stormed off and went GAHH I'm thirsty or something, but quietly stepping away does not cause a disruption. 

Certain schools do have certain protocols, though. I'd say if you were coming to class to observe or to study, then you're ""participating"" in class, even though you're not up punching and kicking. I don't see anything wrong in dressing out for that. 

If she felt confident enough to bring you in at your old belt level, she must be comfortable that you know the basics (without knowing the style, there are some similarities in many, like how to kick, how to punch, etc), and you can at least ""lead"" by teaching the fundamentals to the junior belts. I'd say it's her job to teach the forms, especially if you're so new. 

I dunno. The school sounds like it might be run by a blowhard, or someone who is egotistical. It's all a question of whether or not you feel like the education you're getting is worth dealing with the personality. "

The general consensus is that nobody should willingly buy soy protein, but since you got it for free, and you have so much of it, it might be worth using it.

- I'm pretty good in the kitchen; there are a few meals that I could compete internationally with. That's hyperbole but my chili is still amazing.

- I get off on my partners sexual pleasure, so I'm not selfish in bed.

Cons:

- I can be very lazy. If you want to constantly go out and do shit, you will eventually find me to be a drag.

- If I get carried away with something, I might forget to consider your feelings as much as I should. I just get wrapped up in something and become oblivious.

I'm unsure about how much you've read on here, you seem familiar with concepts such as ""Dark Americana"", that indicates you're not a total newbie, but the rest of this post suggests otherwise.

Drakkanrider,sex,1390429087.0,"I find that the easiest time to be dominant is when you're on top.  Later on, you can learn how to apply a dominant attitude to positions where he should theoretically have control, but it's easiest to learn on top.

It all starts with foreplay.  You have to take charge here, and it will come so much easier when the sex starts.  I'm partial to throwing my man around, moving him where I want him to be and in the positions I want him to be.  I like to spank him, bite him, and pay lots of attention to his more sensitive areas.  He had incredibly sensitive nipples, and I like to play with them until he's so overstimulated he has to bite his fingers or bury his face in the pillow.  Him being vocal helps me a lot.  If your bf is the silent type, tell him he'll need to work on giving you vocal feedback, even if it's just moans.  Its so much easier if you know how much he's enjoying things, you should never have to guess.

When you're on top, hold him down by his hair, don't let him control the rhythm.  If he starts trying to, stop him.  Don't worry about making him orgasm, just worry about you and he will enjoy the ride.  This is my favorite part about being dominant, I don't have to stress about cumming first because I know I will and I have a plethora of great ways to finish him off after.

Prostate stimulation is a great addition too.  Put a buttplug in him and watch him melt onto the bed as you wiggle it around against his prostate.  Nothing sexier than that, in my book."

In those situations, it's easier to remove yourself or just avoid someone than it is to yell at someone to fuck off. You don't know how they'll react and it's easier to deal with someone talking to you than it is to deal with someone being aggressive or handsy.

I still say that ethics basically come down to 'what makes people have positive feelings' and 'what makes people have negative feelings'. It's generally understood that it's unethical to kill people, because it generally 'makes people have negative feelings'. It's generally understood that it's 'good' or 'ethical' to help out people in need, because it 'makes people have positive feelings'. I think you could say that 'justice' is a form to enforce ethics, eg. as punishment as an example/threat (""If you make me have negative feelings, I will make you have negative feelings"").

The point is not that all of the guys are scary rapists. Or even that any of the guys sending bad messages are scary rapists.  That is actually not the point.

The point is, these weird/lewd messages ignore generally accepted social interactions in such a way that they activate the warning system many women have in place for protection.

These systems are (at least mostly) developed in person, to deal with real life threats.

It is true that the threat level is not there to NEARLY the same degree (if at all) online.

But the types of behavior/approach still set off those warning bells.

And because the context of the men's messages are sexual in nature, what you get is:

*behavior that feels off* + *sexual context* =  *feeling of fear of a sexual nature*

It is true that after this happens a woman can say, ""there is no real threat here."" But that feeling of wary dread doesn't necessarily dissipate immediately.

And the longer it hangs around, the more time there is to think about it, why those warning bells exists.

Now, if I haven't misread most of what you've said, you believe women just need to realize it's just the internet and get over it.

However, this is an instinctual reaction/response.

I really do think that, through repetition and experience, it can be contextually modified so that, when online, women feel less each time, and, indeed that has been true for me.

But thinking about this fear/threat response as an over reaction very well could place doubt in the instinct itself.

It needs to be handled in a way that the response itself isn't diminished or doubted, and is still present when it needs to be, in person.

So not:

""This type of advance is harmless, few guys are bad, chances are his motives are good, this is an overreaction""

but:

""Something about this doesn't feel right."" check context ""okay, don't have to determine his intention, because he is not here""

Which does have the downside of having this warning bell go off when it doesn't need to. But that is preferable to considering them false alarms in person."

The black liner all around your eyes sort of makes your eyes look smaller, can I recommend you switch the silver to more neutral browns or purples which would be really flattering on your eyes!

Are you?!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;After all, your sense of self is sufficiently explained by the possibility that you do, indeed, have a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is strong evidence against this. From frontal lobe disinhibition to fMRI and a thousand shades in between, the notion of the mind as this private entity is absurd.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you mean there are theories in development with no consensus. The notion of the mind being a private entity is absurd?! I think you need to define 'private'.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Private: ""a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you"". I can cause massive shifts in your personality with targeted magnetic pulses. I can read your mind (albeit in extremely limited ways) with a good neuroimager. The mind is blatantly not private.

&gt;&gt; That's a really convenient definition for you.

&gt;You first use the phrase ""a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you"". I abbreviate this to ""private"". You question what I mean when I say ""private"". I explain that I am directly using your own phrasing. You object to this phrasing.

&gt;Call it 'private', or 'isolated', or 'mysterious', or 'eggplant' - I really don't care what label you give your criteria. But you're focusing on a pointless definitional argument instead of any actual content. I notice that you utterly failed to respond to any of my responses to your challenges. Does that mean you concede that the mind isn't eggplant?

You are insane. I never defined private that way. You took a phrase that I used and gave it your own definition. Talk about intellectual dishonesty. Nice try.

Edit: I won't continue a debate with a guy who ""abbreviates"" statements I make into definitions of concepts that I don't agree with. Then he tries to tell *me* that I'm changing my definition of private. Yeah, call it an eggplant mate, it won't change the fact that you are dishonest."

I've been on a ton of first dates in Knoxville- enough to refine my method and create a go-to.  That go-to is Downtown Grill and Brewery.  Great food, great environment, great beer, and the prices aren't too expensive or too cheap- perfect price range.  So you have dinner with the person- what about afterwards?!  Well, from that location in downtown you have sooo many options.  I'd usually ask the girl on the date if she'd like to a) catch a movie, b) hit a bar, c) walk around and check out shops, or d) hit up the hookah bar (this one actually occurred most often suprisingly).  DGB is a great place to provide a template for a great first date.

In all honesty, it's just a tactic I use to force people offline to commit to their arguments first. Otherwise, they end up weaseling their way through arguments without strongly committing to any position. You see it online a lot, but you see it even more offline because most people are quite cowardly without Google or Wiki readily available. When they spout popular myths, they're assuming a default position. If you know it already and argue against it, you explicitly commit to a position and they can afford to more lazily sit back and pick at your arguments as well as make subtle ad hominems against you and/or the effort you put in. ""Tryhard"". Think about why you fear correcting this guy, Rex, and why you think it would get you associated with the MRM and why that's bad.

The kind of response you're parodying is frustrating, but at least in that case they are the ones who sound too invested (implying an agenda) if there are others around. Again, it's annoying, but I've found that the easiest way for me to force people out of their comfortable ""default positions"" (mainstream supported opinions) is just to take an even baser, *more* default position.

ZaPzxHunter,Battlefield,1390430004.0,First starts you are not alone. On BF3 the 24/7 high ticket Metro servers were the second most popular among all servers only behind the 500% TDM Canals Servers. Now to answer your question: DICE has already come out and stated that the custom Rent-A-Server feature is coming back to console and PC. Code junkies have also found it within the coding of the game as a reassurance. There has been no official date on when the Service will be up and running due to the fact that networking problems have taken top priority. Most people are saying it will be up and running sometime in late February! Hope this helped answer your question!

If your primary motivation is to skip the HS social shit and you're expecting that things will be all rosy and cheery, that may not necessarily be the case. I had acquaintances that did similar programs. They always seemed on the edge of the social circles. Past highschool, but too young to hang with college age kids. Then when you get to college, you'll still be in a different place from your peers. You'll be farther along in your coursework--at the serious stuff while they're out partying it up their freshman year.

kiwirish,newzealand,1390430283.0,"It is very much so, my Kings only got aired in the SCF in 2012 and WCF in 2013. I think abour half of the 1st and 2nd round gets aired, and then all of the Conference Finals and Cup Final. Hopefully the Olympics will help get more into this great sport. Most regular season games are eastern to fit in the right time slot.

I know there is a league, I'm quite the follower of the West Auckland Admirals, even though we're terrible. The NZIHL is fun, but if we had a team like the Breakers of the NBL that would be very exciting. But finding an arena would be difficult. 

As for tips? Where do you live? In Auckland we've got rinks in Avondale and Botany, plus a rink in Chch, Dunedin and Queenstown. All of those places will offer learn to skate classes and intro hockey classes where you can begin to start playing. Then join a local rec league and work your way up to NZIHL level. There should be a hockey shop near the rink, but I believe there's only one in Auckland, by the Avondale rink, but also a store in Hamilton. 

If you don't live near ice, or can't afford it, there's always inline hockey, and they have more rinks in more places while kind of giving you the ice hockey experience. "

pigeonburger,boardgames,1390430316.0,"Recieved it as a christmas present and after two games with groups of 4, I absolutely love that game.

The amount of different card types and token types was a bit intimidating at first, but it all works out to a well oiled machine that builds the kind of complex narratives we typically only find in directed entertainment out of sets of cards, and that is something I respect a lot.

Now there were some rules we messed up (some in our favor, some to our detriment) and I'm not sure how it affect how difficult the game is supposed to be, but we managed to win both our games, although by the skin of our teeth. I suppose one could increase difficulty by increasing the ""number of players"" variable without actually increasing the number of players (playing as if there were 6 players while there are only 4).

One thing I'm wary of is that while the game is great fun *now*, once the flavor text starts losing its flavor from having been re-read too many times, the game mechanics are a bit bare and I'm worried about replayability. Of course, a ""play against the board"" game has a limited amount of content to be played, but this one relies almost exclusively on a single mechanic (skill tests), which without the flavor text, and with a fixed amount of contexts in which those tests are made, gives it a limited lifespan.

I really hope Fantasy Flight plans on making expansions for it; they'd be instant buys for me."

BigFishMcNish,nfl,1390430325.0,"True. At the same time, while Marshawn takes away DBs from Golden and Doug, the ensemble of talent for the Broncos' receivers and TEs makes it hard for defenses to double up. They also have Peyton throwing to them. I'm not trying to compare them at all, I'm just saying that the circumstances are endless and I'm also *not* saying that if thrown to enough on this current team, would our receivers put up those number that the writer extrapolated. I think that was just to prove a point that they're not abysmal like some think. 

On top of that, I'm thoroughly convinced that if you swapped Doug Baldwin for Welker in the Broncos' current offense, he would put him similar numbers as Welker and make more plays downfield. I also believe if you kept Welker there but swapped Decker for Tate, Tate would also put up good, efficient numbers. I'm not trying to compare them as I have no interest to, I'm just saying that the circumstances would be suited for their talents to be exploited, especially by Peyton as QB and that offensive line. However, the situation in seattle isn't conducive to large numbers for a wr, at least until we get better protection. Even then, Russell will still distribute amongst his targets as that's what Bevell calls for. "

1.*Pukekos, like paradise shelduck and the Canada goose have benefited from land clearance and the development of land as pasture and for crops and market gardening. They have also adapted well to urbanisation.*

So their population has actually **exploded due to human development**, as they eat grasses.

2.*While they look very attractive in the wild, they are in fact quite aggressive and will attack, particularly, the chicks of other species. The culling of pukeko on Great Barrier Island by the Department of Conservation has been a major part of the programme to restore the population of little brown teal.*

DOC has been culling them in some places anyways, to protect other native species who arent doing so well, and who the pukekos sometimes kill. The page also mentions that **DOC organises special culling seasons** to reduce their numbers on mainland NZ.

DO NOT confuse the Pukeko with the Takahe, though they look almost the same. The pukeko would eat the takahe's chicks given the chance.

I didn't think you were an idiot at all. Considering you knew about those laws I assumed you also knew about the municipal networks. I assumed you actually knew more than the average Joe on the subject and were being intentionally misleading. Too much reddit can make you somewhat of a cynic. 

I'm actually been thinking about this for a while. I'm a 3rd year law student and i think there needs to be a legal association that supports municipalities when they fight huge companies like Comcast and TWC. A town of 6000 would have a tough time going up again Comcast or Time Warner on their own. When I first read about the North Carolina law a while back I started thinking about forming one of these once I graduated. The only problem is I don't think too many seasoned lawyers would join an organization ran by such an inexperienced guy. But it would be nice to have one organization companies like Google and also consumers could donate to to help fight this nation wide.

Long story short I think what Comcast and Time Warner are doing is a huge problem. I just thought you were intentionally ignoring that these networks existed in the US. Who knows, maybe municipalities can get innovative with how they raise funds for legal costs. Crowdfunding for a day would probably cover most legal fees if it were posted on reddit. Especially if a federal court sides with a municipality it could have rippling effects that are beneficial for everyone so fighting a law in North Carolina doesn't necessarily only help people in North Carolina."

One genius ran to the campus bookstore and bought elmers glue (an Arizona trick, let the glue dry and peel it off, it takes the thorns with it).

TL;DR: Cactus. Ow.

Sure I've seen yoga instructors and kids who have done ballet since they were six jump on and start surfing. But for the average off-the-couch American, it might take several hours per day for several weeks before they can walk halfway across the line.

If you have some down time, this would be a good way to spend it, with no plans or expectations. But unless you willing to commit a significant portion of time to getting participants adept at walking, building additional exercises off a slackline doesn't seem very feasible.

If you have some work around or other idea, I'd encourage you to try it. I'd love to be proven wrong on this."

josebolt,AskReddit,1390430744.0,"ONE.Treat her how you want to be treated. With that in mind many traditional marriage roles get eliminated, IMO. Don't refuse to take on certain responsibilities because of what's between your legs. TWO. There is also communication (which will get pointed out about a 1,000 times) which of course is important, but it also means knowing when to shut up. THREE.The last thing I can think of is the Nothing Test. Basically can/do you enjoy your partners company when you are doing ""nothing""? For example going on a long car ride. Do you have nice conversations or do sit in silence or even argue? 

I think the last one is particularly important because as a relationship progresses you will have other important things in your life, such as kids, careers, even issue with your extended family like aging parents. With all these responsibilities it is difficult to find time for the things that maybe you did while you were dating. Sometime its hard for young couples to understand that the honeymoon period doesn't last forever. So yeah marathon sex and spontaneous blow jobs have a tendency to become rare despite everything you read in r/sex. Even just going out for a drink may be a challenge. Thats why its important to be able to enjoy being with your wife when you are doing ""nothing"". I actually love doing ""nothing"" with my wife.

hopewings,BabyBumps,1390430761.0,"I am glad that marijuana use has worked out for you, but I have a different personal history and perspective on this subject.  My ex used it around me, and with absolutely no history of any gynecological problems, I had an ectopic pregnancy and a miscarriage while living with him.

Then I read some research linking marijuana with ectopic pregnancy and pregnancy loss:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/08/060804085719.htm
http://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/news/20060801/marijuana-use-may-thwart-pregnancy

The ectopic pregnancy was my first time being pregnant (I was in my early 20s), and when I started having pains on my side, I had no idea what was going on.  It was not until I was about 7 weeks along and having excruciating pain that I went to the doctor, who determined via nothing showing up on the ultrasound and my HCG levels that I had an ectopic pregnancy. 

I was administered a methotrexate shot.  It was very scary and painful, and I was bleeding internally from the rapidly growing fetus inside my fallopian tube.  I went to the emergency room as the fetus passed, and I managed to avoid being rushed into emergency surgery to have the fallopian tube removed.  

I don't personally use it, nor am I around anyone who uses it now.  No matter how bad my nausea and all day sickness through my pregnancies, I'd rather suffer that than take on more risk.  I would caution women who are trying to conceive or pregnant against it.  I wanted to give the other side of the story, because I see a lot of cheering for medical marijuana use -- but it has both pros and cons, and one should not be blind to the cons."

I get told I am wrong by everybody here. Orthodox and not. In fact, most recently I was told I was wrong by /u/LazerA, a user to the right of me, and that is fine with me.

&gt;so long as they are willing to be insulted

That is what the report button is for. Perhaps you should use it.

&gt; And then you sit and you wonder ""where did they all go? How can we get them to come back?""

No. I sit and wonder ""why did somebody complain about not seeing cultural posts, all while refusing to post cultural posts?""

""Why do people complain about an orthodox majority when every piece of data I present says otherwise?""

""Why do people feel the right to not be questioned?"" You have every right to not engage.

""Why do people get to complain about something, all while doing nothing themselves to change it?""

""Why do people complain about not having x resource, when it is sitting right in the sidebar?""

All five of these were survey results that showed up multiple times. In fact, one person even said ""Not enough articles from Heeb magazine"". If that person really wanted that, he/she could have posted it him/herself.

This is something I have been working on for a year. And what happened? I banned people for not being polite. I warned dozens of people to shape it up, which they did. And then nobody who actually complained stepped up. I feel like an idiot."

I think that it would be completely unfair to base it completely on artistic skill alone as that would be limiting those who have a chance. I chose hamnams because they were able to bring a different sort of theme to the idea. It was up to cosmicaa's and hamnams, and they were both extremely creative and nicely done, I just chose hamnams in the end. I'm sorry if you don't agree with my opinion, but that's how it is.

I_speak_Australian,aww,1390430911.0,"His symptoms were similar to what the others have mentioned. Basically, I would describe his behaviour as weird.

When we woke up last Monday morning, Moose vomited once (not so unusual on its own as it's summer here and he's shedding fur). After that, he was repeatedly going to the litter box and not producing anything. However, he did go and pee in the dog's bed before I went to work. Peeing outside the litter is pretty unusual for Moose, and as it turns out, it's one of the common signs of bladder crystals.

I mentioned the behaviour to someone at work, and she was the first person to tell me that Moose might have bladder crystals as her cat had the same issue a few years ago. She also told me that one her friend's cats died from it, so from that point, I started to creepily monitor every trip Moose made to the litter box.

He seemed quite fine for the rest of the week, so we wondered if Monday's episode was something less sinister. That is, until Saturday morning when he literally could not pee. Another common symptom of bladder crystals is blood in urine and obvious pain. While Moose didn't show any of those signs, it was very clear he wasn't well. We rushed him to the vet that morning, and they started treatment immediately.

Short-term treatment was a drip, catheter, and a variety of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication. The vet told us that he passed over a litre of urine during his first night on the drip. Long-term treatment will involve a special diet (currently Royal Canin Urinary S/O) and plenty of water. We're going to get one of those motorised fountains so he's inclined to drink more often. It's definitely not something I ever want to see Moose go through again!"

Overall there is only 2 guns in BF4 so far that should be used to hip fire and its the JS2 and the P90. These are the only 2 you should really be attempting to hip fire with the current weapon stats in BF4. Its not a anti hip fire value its just the guns have not had a lot of time to balance and thus most weapons wont hip fire well! If you are looking for more info on hip firing and the state of it in-game plus a nice compare between JS2 and P90 youtuber Matimo just upload a great video today breaking it all down!

danielbearh,ENFP,1390431068.0,"I did find myself.

In HS, I had no idea what my personality was or even have the slightest awareness of what made me me. 

I knew I was a bright, hyper creative, more effeminate guy. And I knew that was different from my peers at school. I didn't have a social circle, so I dove deep online. I wrote a blog on xanga that ended up being pretty popular (among other 16 year olds.) I taught myself graphic design. Photography. Composing stuff on the piano. I read constantly. I worked on myself. I thought I was an introvert, if anything. For real. I was a character out of The Perks of Being a Wallflower. 

Cue college, and suddenly I found myself surrounded by so many people that the options were endless. I got super involved in a lot of student groups. I realized I was really good at promoting. So I handled that aspect for all the groups I worked with.

I realized I loved other smart, down to earth people. I became really confident in myself, and people can tell. It isn't a cocky thing, it's a lack of insecurity.

The best advice I can give is to take these years in HS and use them to think about what types of people you want to hang out with, and make yourself someone that they'd want to hang with. Confident in yourself. Having your own passions. Do creative stuff. Learn a subject. 

Long story short, college was a blast and set me up to be confident socially for the rest of myself. I went from being the ostracized, lonely quiet gay dude to being a ""popular"" guy on campus. I was even on homecoming court my senior year.

It gets better. :-) smile. Realize that life will always be up and down. You're in a down moment right now, but if you're anything like me, it'll make you ecstatic when you look at how far you've come one day."

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1390431096.0,"I've said this before, but my first experience of RP sexual strategy was back in HS. I ended up getting involved with the group of the 9.5/10 hot as fuck hypergamous popular chick. She was the type that had hoards of men giving her everything she wanted, from fellow HS students to dudes in their 30s. 

Anyways, once I got involved with her group I promised NOT to play into her game. Not that I didn't want to, but by looking around that game clearly just left a lot of blue balled dudes with less of a paycheck. I knew there was NO WAY in hell I'd sleep with her, even if I did my best. So I didn't play. I rejected every sexual advance she made at me (because I knew this is how she got guys to play by her rules) and I called out her shit publicly (because since I'm not trying to fuck her, and no one is calling out her BS, someone has to do it). 

Eventually I ended up fucking her in a hot-tub. It was hands down some of the hottest sex I've ever had, even up until this day - Definitely top 10. 

Anyways, shortly after that encounter I quickly reverted to BP trying to keep the sex coming, but she quickly got bored with me and it stopped. That's when I learned my first RP truth: regardless of looks, treat all women like an ugly chick you have no interest in. Magically they will crave your approval and submit to your frame. 

EDIT: In response to a PM, I just want to point out something for all the lurkers. You can't be a neckbeard and utilize this strategy. Don't just think that because you start acting this way doesn't mean you can get away with it. Remember, alphas can get away with being a dick and betas cant. At the time I had a decent amount of social proof being decently good looking, though skinny as fuck, as well as my parents having one of the best homes in a high end neighborhood. If you're an overweight neckbeard living in your mom's basement, most of these TRP principles aren't going to work. You need to focus on the foundation first. Yes, you can be a poor artist and get away with it, but you need to have value somehow. But judging on the demographic of Reddit, I'm going to assume your poor and out of shape because you're weak, and not because your an artist trying to chase some new idea. "

The truth is almost the exact opposite. And the positions shift as the social arrangement and technology does. Which is why an anti welfare, anti universal healthcare anti free condoms, birth control + vasectomies crowd is just pissing in the wind.

She's also in every single KI game so far. Out of all of the KI characters, she'd be the most likely one to join Pit. Being ""playable"" also was never a requirement: See Zelda or Ganondorf.

However these screenshots are iffy. Real iffy. Why are they taking offscreen pics of her? Is it a rogue developer or something? Is that what we're supposed to think? She seems strange in the one next to Mario, like she's not exactly the same color palette, but its hard to tell because of the pic quality so it could be lighting.

I'm damn sure she'll be playable since there's very few new Nintendo IPs in recent years so i assume they'd pick someone from KI's most recent reboot/outing (I was thinking either Palutena or Medusa since they've been there since the first game, and in Medusa's case Sakurai said Smash is a bit low on villains and female fighters so she's two birds with one stone), but I'm not sure these pics are proof of that."

&gt;These shots also help to show you are a real person behind the technology.

Amazing point.

&gt;I do think it is important to focus on what your target market might want to hear though.

This is true, so long as you don't veer too far away from who you are.  I'd leave out that I like playing with rubik's cubes not because I think it might be too nerdy, but because it's something I do in my own time and not really all that relevant.  People just aren't going to care, so I'm with you there.

&gt;I actually find it a little weird how much people talk about their families

I think the problem is it's sort of a hard topic to talk about.  It's either endearing or a little creepy.  My sister is one of my best friends - if I put it in my profile, half the people will think ""aww"" and the other half will think ""weirdo.""  It's best left out. I think the farthest I've gone about family is the question where I answer ""I listen to my parents' input, but then I make my own decisions"" or something like that.  Some people let their parents rule their life, and I just want to clarify that I'm independent.

&gt;Also yah for avatar! 

I have a framed fire ferrets poster maybe 3 feet from me right now!

&gt; I have left it blank and I have tried various witty options but it never seems to affect things either way.

Yeah, it's pretty useless.  Usually by the time you get down there, you've made your choice.  Unless it says something like ""message me if you like massive orgies!"" it's probably not going to change anything.

&gt;I always take a lot of time to consider each person. 

Well, just to clarify a bit, the speed is just for the initial screening process.  Each step takes more and more time.  The first one is instant - is there attraction?  Either way, you immediately move on to the next step.  The next is to just take a glance at their profile for red flags - it takes a little more time, but should still be quick.  Imagine you're an employer or in HR or whatever at a big company and you have 200 applicants.  Do you look at every single one in detail?  No, you have a method for narrowing it down very quickly so that you're spending your time on maybe 10-20 applicants instead of hours and hours on 200.  You want the best, right?  If you looked at every one of those in detail, you'd get bored not even halfway through, and you'd give up and discard the remainder.  By going quickly for the major stuff, you get to see way more people and have a better chance at finding that better match.  I usually spend time going through all the questions of the people I'm really interested in, but that's only after I've decided they're worth my time.

&gt;Perhaps you should write a book.

Haha what's funny is my girlfriend was with me when my friend asked for advice on how to make her profile better, so I gave her my spiel.  So later on, she (my SO) sends me a message while at work of a TED talk that she was listening to about online dating.  She said that this woman reverse engineered online dating in order to maximize the amount of messages and dates that she got with this really elaborate numbers system.  It was silly - she uses basically the exact formula that's already inherent in okcupid, except that she does it all out on paper or excel on her own.  The whole point of dating sites is to expedite that method.  A quick look on the about page or whatever it is on okcupid explains how it works, and all you have to do is realize how to use that to the best of your ability and you'd see exactly what I just told you.  But apparently it warranted hours and hours of pointless research and number crunching.  And she gets a TED talk?  Lame...

Vilhu,malefashionadvice,1390431271.0,"I'm partly unsure as to what you're saying here, so if I misunderstood, please correct and disregard me. 

Wearing roshes with an OCBD or polo is bad. An item of clothing has a formality, a class or a style. Roshes say tech, while a polo says (to some extent) prep. You generally don't want to take items from these different groups and wear them in the same fit. 


Regarding leather chucks as ""more formal"" is an interesting idea. I guess by that you mean that they're plausible to wear with chinos and an OCBD. That is true, but I would not recommend moving further down the ""formality line"". Having the chucks being in leather doesn't really change their formality, and I personally dislike their look. Wearing regular chucks would get you just as far. If you interested in a leather shoe instead I'd recommend looking into the Clark Desert Boot. 

 
As to shoes to wear with something like short &amp; an OCBD/Polo I'd look in to some low-top sneakers. Maybe Vans, low-top coverse, nike killshots or a random pair of plimsolls.  "

I try not to think of it as an insult, though, but I wish my weight and size wouldn't come up in conversation.

however, I think it can be used as a compliment. if you know someone's been trying hard to lose weight, then I think commenting that they look skinny or that they're looking really good can be a nice compliment.

I sat down over Christmas with her and tried my best to get her to take notice, ( she's 5 now) there wasn't much luck but occasionally during 5-10 minute stretches she'd sit on my lap and watch the scene, I dunno if it's chance or she knew how much the films meant to me but she had never done that before with any other film.

I try to be reasonable, but I can be very stubborn, especially if I feel like my needs are going to place a burden on somebody else. In that case, I prefer to just take the problem on by myself and have to be sometimes pushed to let others take care of me.

I try to listen and treat you as well as I can, but if I don't see a decision being made or see you being wishy-washy about something, I'll just make an executive decision and that often runs over the preferences of the person I'm dating.

  Which would obviously be noticed by the company. So we freak out and the guy who gave us the fucking idea withdraws the money and goes to give it back with a god damn confession letter. 

  Lucky for him though, the entire office burnt down over night and the company folded. So all records were destroyed, no one ever read the letter. Can't quite believe we had and then lost the money though. Anyway my buddy is working construction now and me and a friend moved onto another company. As fun as those few crazy days were, I wouldn't do it again. I've never been more scared in my life.

In any case, the Golden Gate Bridge is 746 ft tall, and class E airspace starts at 700.

It's also illegal to fly under the golden gate bridge.  I'm not sure how that applies to RC aircraft, but the only thing that can fly under the golden gate as far as I know are emergency helicopters and others like it with clearance.

dsklerm,AskWomen,1390432761.0,"Think about it this way.  Those individuals may of bought off more than they can chew, but in most cases their age wasn't the reason they couldn't handle it. If let's say a 16 year old has a baby, the issue isn't that she's 16.  It's that she can't provide a home herself for the baby, or that she can't finish school, or that she hasn't learned enough about being a mother.  But being 16 doesn't prevent that from happening, it's her own experiences.  Now compare that to the 16 year old with a baby who ran away from home, worked hard and stayed in school and became an awesome mom. Don't you think the fact that their are two separate possibilities reduces the chance that age was a factor?  Doesn't it seem more like an unrelated fact about two people who are very different?   Experience helps in life but age doesn't indicate experience.  that 5 year old in South Sudan could probably tell me a lot about the world I didn't know about.  There are too many factors in understanding an individual to think age has that much bearing.  It's not worth dismissing them up front, or forcing them to prove themselves.  If they're in experienced in whatever they're attempting it'll manifest itself in other ways that are more appropriate and correctable. The issue with ageism is the idea that you're dismissing someone because of their age, not because of what is actually wrong. "

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390432999.0,"I made [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1vuv1u/i_refuse_to_date_women_that_expect_continual_use/cewa9lf) that the top commenter on this thread that agreed with your position said was enlightening.  I think OP is just being misunderstood because people are going on the defensive.

Just for a little extra information (and I'd appreciate if you read the other comment first if you don't mind, it might give this more context), I've been in a few LTRs, and most were condoms only, and only my current is on birth control.  The reason none of the others were on the pill was because of medical issues (one actually had a medical issue preventing it, the other didn't react well to the hormonal changes).  I understand that not everyone can go on the pill, and I never expect them to.  I wouldn't ever.  

But the thing is, sex to me is nowhere near the same with a condom.  Not just the sensations (I feel almost nothing and they're tight), but it takes out spontaneity.  It's such a buzzkill when things start to get heated and you have to look around for a condom, or maybe you're about to have sex in the kitchen but you don't have a condom nearby.  One time we got into her garage and had at it right there.  You can't do that with condoms.  *I want those things.*  That makes sex life amazing to me.  It would be like being with a girl that is only willing to go missionary and nothing else.  Condoms, like it or not, have a habit of changing the sex life, and that means that I'm incompatible with someone who isn't on BC.  

And here's the major part that I think people keep missing - I'm not forcing anyone to be on BC.  I don't think they're unworthy, I don't think they're wrong, it's not their fault, it has nothing to do with any of that.  I just look for a certain type of sex life with my partner, and I'd rather *start* a relationship with someone that wants that sex life, too.  And for the record, if there were a male birth control, I would absolutely be willing to look into it, just like my girlfriend looked into BC for herself (before we were dating for the record).  She was happy to be on it regardless of the side effects, and if I felt the same way, then I'd do the same.  

Also, a couple months ago, she realized that her birth control was causing her to go a little crazy when she had her period.  She said that she's going to look into it, and I told her that if it was causing her problems, to get the hell off it now because she doesn't need to be going through that.  But she said that she was going to stay on until the doctor figured things out because she does it *for her*.  And that's the kicker - OP doesn't want someone on BC for *him*, he wants to *find* someone that's on BC for themselves.  While they were figuring things out, she said that we might have to switch to condoms, and I told her no problem at all, I supported her 100%. But that's *after* a strong relationship was developed, and OP even said in another comment that if he was with someone who had to get off the pill and they had to switch to condoms, he would absolutely stay with her and support her entirely.  I think people are just reacting emotionally instead of really seeing what he's saying.  IMO, he's not being selfish at all - would you want to get into a relationship with someone that you couldn't satisfy sexually while other people could?  It's like guys with a micropenis - I wouldn't think there would be anything wrong if a woman didn't want to be with someone that had one.  It's totally understandable.  "

nerowasframed,cringe,1390433017.0,"It's private property. Walmart can restrict use of firearms even more so than the law states. For example, the guy knows that the law says that it is illegal for anyone to bring a firearm into a place of business that has at least 51% of its earnings from alcohol. That doesn't mean he is allowed to bring firearms into any store that doesn't have at least 51% of its earnings from alcohol sales. This is because as long as he is on an institution's property, he must abide by their private policies. Walmart's policy is more strict than the law (I don't know what the specific policy is), and so he is not allowed to carry his AR-15 in the store.

As for the video recording, the same idea is the reason for that. If Walmart restricts people from recording video, that means that he (because he is on Walmart's private property) cannot film anything. If he does, Walmart is able to kick him out and/or have arrested for violating store policy."

Not only that, but this comes from projection. Most pro life people don't consider abortion to have to do with exclusively women at all. In fact, if you go to pro life groups, which are mostly female populated, they will often accuse abortion of being a male dominated issue that frees males from responsibility in relationships. Or at the very least talk about it as if it goes both ways. Projecting that it's entirely on females is something pro choice people THINK pro life people do, since that's how THEY talk about it. But pro life groups really do not do that. Trying to get the idea of how they act from how Rush Limbaugh acts is not really the best source.

&gt;abortion bans which protect parents from legal consequences.

The entire issue of this is that they DO understand that it is something many people get pushed into thinking they have to do it. And that it would be even worse in their eyes to try to arrest everyone involved. They are admitting that to many people it is not deliberate, and so they are trying to prevent it without causing worse problems for the families / etc. Many things are illegal, but punished only vaguely in this way. I'm not sure how being less sympathetic would make them viewed more highly.

&gt;Opposing contraception.

As much as the people who do this are wrong to, and it does contradict their goals, this comes from two mistaken assumptions, one being that contraception indirectly causes many abortions (Which for most versions this is considered to be rare/ a myth.), and that ultimately the education is more or less going to be behind more irresponsible behavior. In the minds of some of these people, they think of times before abortions were as prevalent and think that that can be recreated without the technology. (My other posts in this thread explain why that's wrong, but either way.)

&gt;exceptions for rape and incest.

In case the author failed to realize this, most pro life positions obviously do not want rape to be considered an acceptable time for one. But some of them see this as a position that while only applying to a minuscule percentage, will make them bigger tend and thus more palatable to people in the middle of the issue. The people who think that is a time for exceptions are not saying it's any better. They are saying that if you apply this logic to other thigns that socially exist that it is the best balance one can try to create that makes people not have to constantly worry, but still protects everyone as much as possible. Calling that a punishment is like calling car insurance a punishment. It's not to punish people for crashing. It's to ensure that if someone does that other people don't have to suffer for it. The rape exception in this circumstance is to allay the fear of pregnancy people are totally un in control of, while seeing other ones as protect-able. (Note the people who would make that exception are generally not the same people as the group above.)

&gt;Banning partial birth abortion.

This is an issue that they are bringing to light to try to explain even to pro choice people that if they make a limit that it should only be before 20 weeks based on their philosophy, that they should actually hold to their philosophy instead of hypocritically not care either way. It may be misguided, but to act like that's deliberately for harm is openly ridiculous.

&gt;Advocating less welfare.

It IS true that this is bad, however they mistakenly think that welfare as a whole is economically an unfeasible issue. This is less about their actual views on it as much as them mistakenly thinking charity is enough. (Which they do do much of at least), and being tied to a political party that is pretending to care about abortion in order to use them.

&gt;condemning bombers.

This one is bizarre in that it makes sense to oppose it. What is bombing going to accomplish? There is no way they will cause a revolution and solve all the problems. So all ti does is damage their own credibility while not actually effecting anything. The same people might condemn violent action in many cases they see as severe, but do not think it will help in.

The last one is more or less a repeat.

The point is if you're going to disagree with something, at least try to disagree with the thing itself. A string of irrelevant ad hominems that try to pretend people don't care about something they obviously do because of a handful of things, which are not even all done by the same people, and which many of can be chalked up to being mistaken about something at any rate just makes you look like you're cutting to the chase and directly using dishonesty, since you don't have any better tools."

Malarazz,DotA2,1390433145.0,"No, I realize that perfectly well. However, what I'm saying is that if you have 4 bad players and 1 good one playing carry, and the other team has 4 bad players and a good one playing support, the first team will (generally) win, simply because a carry is a lot more influential in that scenario.

Supports are influential too, don't get me wrong, but in different scenarios. They are influential when you have 4 good players playing carries/initiators. In that scenario, the team with 4 carries/initiators + a support will be a lot better than 5 carries/initiators."

theshins_simplesong,vegan,1390433181.0,"Honestly, the best way for your parents to begin to understand what being a vegan is really about is to see if first hand. If you really are committed to being a vegan I feel that you need to rip off the bandaid so to speak and tell them that you want to do this. If they already know about the other decisions you have made in your life then this is one more step you need to take. I came from a household that was totally homnivore and never considered veganism as a life style. Now my dad is the only person who eats meat in the family, but mostly eats vegan. The only way your family is going to change is if they experience it first hand. Offer to cook for your family and make them a delicious meal so that they can really see what vegan food is like. There is a lot of mystery it seems behind vegan food. The outside world seems to think we only eat grass. You need to be the force for change you want to see in the world. Eventually your family may even change to see why having chickens is not the best thing."

kwowo,INTP,1390433429.0,"Any type can be logical, it's just a matter of how you use your functions. From what I've observed there is a much stronger correlation between intelligence and logical thinking than what your type might indicate. I have a very logical INFP friend who also happens to be very intelligent.

The difference between Ti and Te are more about how you deal with systems and non-personal information. Alone they really don't do much, as Ti needs input from the outside (in our case through Ne), and Te needs ideas to put to the test (through Ni in the case of NTJs). If you're a Ti user, you're perfectly content thinking about stuff and never do anything about it. If you're a (dominant/auxiliary) Te user, you're very efficient with your ideas, scrapping them if they're bad, and putting them to the test in the world if you think they'll hold up.

The problem with Fi dominants is that their Te is inferior, so until they develop it, they really suck at testing their ideas, plus their ideas might come from extraverted intuition filtered through introverted feeling, which makes them highly entertaining, but rarely very useful in the real world. This might also be one of the reasons why INFPs tend to be excellent fiction writers.

The difference between Fi and Fe.. Fi is about feeling strongly about things, but not necessarily doing anything about it. Fe is about a need to connect with other people and ""not bottling up emotions"". If I'm angry at something, there is a 95% chance that I'll make noise (depending on the circumstance) or something to let off steam. Fi dominants tend to brood more when they're angry (at least that's what it seems like), and apply a sort of ""personal logic"" to their feelings.

Not sure if that made much sense."

Anything under .5g can be rounded down to 0g legally, and the serving size is .26g (which is funny because that's a 1/3 second spray but most cans will recommend a full second spray to cover a skillet)



It's still nothing much to worry about though. Even assuming that it is 100% fat, with a serving size of .26g you'd need to use about a third of a can of most of these sprays to reach your daily recommendation."

Even when set to low, the pain will only be limited to a body part and needless to say, it's an excellent deterrent.

So the question is, what is so attractive about short guys?  Is it that they are more likely to have less confidence?  Small dick stigma?  Not as strong as tall guys?  Not as dominate?

Once I figure this out I'll make sure to compensate by purposefully displaying my confidence, or maybe I'll walk around in gym shorts with no underwear... or whatever it is about short guys that girls find unattractive.

Clockw0rk,funny,1390433584.0,"Most people don't understand that in order to have an effective antivirus, it needs to be able to run at a low enough level that it can intercept potentially malicious happenings on your machine. That means adding overhead and getting in deep.

More often than not, you can safely and completely remove all ACTIVE components of an antivirus product by simply going to the add/remove programs area. However, because the software is often hooked into the OS several levels deep, should one of those components break it may require manual removal. (most software will leave settings files, in case you reinstall) 

Manual removal of any system integrated software SUUUUUCKS and is typically far too beyond an average user's skills, which is why things like ""removal tools"" exist. They're an automated manual uninstaller that forcefully removes items MSI wasn't able to.

MSI, which most all installers run on, is made by Microsoft, but most people have a poor grasp of where system level software ends and third-party software begins, so they blame installer issues on the product maker rather than the installer maker. Nevermind any of the potentially hundreds of environmental and permission checks the installer has to do on the environment of the OS for an install to be successful.

Source: I work in IT (duh) and I'm very familiar with Norton as I work for an AV vendor. User environments are more often responsible for install/uninstall issues than the product itself. aka, *your windows is broke and it's not our fault. Call Microsoft.*"

chaosakita,Foodforthought,1390433612.0,"A liberal arts degree in America is supposed to provide a well-balanced education, not just focus on one particular subject. Maybe getting math for most people is not ""practical"", but I think it's critical that people are exposed to different types of thinking, and the thinking people do with math is one of them.

If a student seems to be doing well in other classes and is only having trouble with classes in certain subjects, I think they definitely should get support. But I don't think it means getting rid of certain requirements entirely.

I really think that the attitude that math is a terrible subject a lot of Americans seem to have is just really a symptom of mathphobia that is setting people back from being able to achieve in that area."
