banana-tree,Turkey,1390503273.0,"No it's a good question, not one I can do justice. It's also a political question with no easy answer, and as I said I'm more concerned about how people react to the consequences rather than the alternative routes not taken. But I'll still try to come up with something just because it's an interesting thing to think about and because I've been thinking about that too recently.

It depends on what you mean by 'better' and for whom. Ideally, of course, they would've just fought off the rebels instead of emptying out entire villages, and protected the Turkish villages from the gangs. They were too weak for that and had already lost much of their land in the Balkans doing just that. That's what normally happens and 'should' happen when a weak empire can't keep its minorities happy, and when those minorities are under nationalist influences. 

For one thing, the aim of the Ottomans made some of this 'necessary'.The demographic change in the region was intended, in order to weaken Armenian claims especially in the six vilayets historically considered as part of Armenia as a region. If we want a 'better' solution while still satisfying that aim (because otherwise the current borders of Turkey that we take for granted wouldn't have had as much legitimacy during the peace talks after the war of independence), we have less alternatives. Maybe better protection for those who were relocated to prevent massacres, looting and kids breaking off from families, chances to sell off their property instead of having them taken away etc.

Because we take the current borders for granted, and because the Armenian gangs may have done similar things to the Turkish villages within their borders, it's not an easy thing to discuss, but considering Turkey ended up a nation state itself, it's important to recognize what it took for that to be possible, beyond heroic stories of the War of Independence.

[Have a read here](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://64.62.200.70/PERIODICAL/PDF/AtlanticMonthly-1915may/87-96/), I think you'll find it interesting -- it's from May 1915, written some months before that so even the April 24 executions in Istanbul hadn't happened as it was being written. I found most of it an interesting read but I'll quote the relevant part (to demonstrate how borders were being drawn at the time, and what people thought of Turkey's legitimacy);

&gt; *... The real trouble, of course, with Enver Pasha and his patriotic Young Turks is that their fundamental thesis is untenable -- except for themselves. When they perorate about the sacred soil of their fathers and weep over their lost provinces, it is affecting because they really mean it. But no one not a Turk can sympathize with them very deeply. For their lost provinces were as little Turkish as anything could be, and if the sacred soil of their fathers exist anywhere it is hardly in the empire they rule. If time and antiquity of sentiment could count for anything, the soil of that empire is far more sacred to the Greeks, to the Armenians, to the Kurds, to the Arabs and to all the other people who were there centuries before the Turks broke out of the east. No amount of oratory or patriotism can change that cold indestructible fact. And therein, my poor Turks young and old, whom I truly love, lies your tragedy. You are squatters in fields which are not your own, and your own have been too long lost for you to find again. Time was, perhaps, when you might, by killing or forcibly converting the men whose lands you invaded, have made those lands your own. But that time is past. ...* "

Griemak,Fitness,1390503491.0,"DAA only raised testosterone in infertile (low-T) men, though.

From Examine.com that you provided a link to:

&gt;Short term usage of D-aspartic acid seems to increase testosterone, but prolonged usage is associated with both an increase and no significant change. There has been an induction (increase) in the enzyme that degrades D-aspartic acid, which suggests negative feedback, and it is plausible this negative regulation occurs in athletes (normal to high testosterone) and not in infertile men (low testosterone) as the second group experiences prolonged increases in testosterone

The citation for that statement is the same study that [spawned this Suppversity blog.](http://suppversity.blogspot.com/2013/08/when-hype-meets-reality-d-aspartic-acid.html)

So DAA is a huge MAYBE within a window of 3 weeks, without any indication of how long a cycle-off is needed to provide that boost again.  Also, estrogen was not the cause of the regulation, so blockers won't help.

Low-T (infertility level of low testosterone) and ""I'm now normal because I'm not injecting gear this week"" are not the same thing, even PCT's are questionable in using DAA..."

Once it's time to undertake your studies, work with your career counselor (if you have one at your school) in order to streamline the path of your studies so as to shape yourself into the best candidate for the job.

**Review: RealTechniques eye brush set**

Overall, this is a very nice brush set. I was looking for an inexpensive set of eye brushes to supplement the [Sephora set](http://www.sephora.com/face-eye-travel-tool-kit-P105102) that I've had for awhile. Individual brush reviews, left to right: 

* Deluxe Crease Brush: I didn't really like this brush for eye work actually. It was too unwieldy for crease work and kind of scattered shadow everywhere except where I wanted it. BUT, it is PERFECT for concealing work on my face. I like to apply a small amount of concealer to my blemishes, and then use this brush to buff the concealer to flawless perfection. It's like using Photoshop on my face. 

* Base Shadow Brush: Very good for exactly what it says. It delivers a nice, even wash of color to the lids. The wide, flat, pointy shape is much easier to work with than the more rounded brush from the Sephora set that I had been using. 

* Brow Brush: Also a great brush. I didn't have a brow brush before this--I was using a smudge brush--and I'm pleased with the results. Check out my FOTD to see how my brows turned out using this brush. I used the Sonia Kashuk Arch Alert brow kit, which is a very stiff cream product. I had to work the brush into the product a bit to get enough on, but that's more the fault of the product than the brush. I think this brush would work really well for filling with powder, although I haven't tried that yet. 

* Accent Brush: Really nice for detail work on the eyes. I used it to smudge darker shadow on the outer corners of my eyes and liked the result. I'm excited to have this one in my collection. 

* Pixel-Point Eyeliner Brush: I really don't think this brush would be good for gel liner, which I normally use. It's also not fine enough to deliver a ""pixel point"" line--use an angled liner brush for that. That said, it's excellent for smudging shadow along the lower lashline and would work well for creating a softer look. 

**Review: American Beauty Spice So Nice Lipstick**

Pros: The color payoff on this lipstick is excellent. It's easy to apply and I think it's a really nice color. I'm excited to wear it for summer. 

Cons: The formula is a bit soft, almost gooey. I ate chips and dip about 45 minutes after application and it was gone, gone, gone. I'm okay with that, as I expect to reapply lipstick after eating and it's not marketed as a long-wear lipstick. It also has kind of a weird smell/taste, but it does fade after awhile. I have heard that American Beauty is owned by/a dupe for Estée Lauder, but I've never used her products so I can't speak to that.

Fast forward two years later and I ask for the recipe again. This time she changed the ingredients to be ""mustard powder or curry powder"".  The hell? I inquire about this change and she tells me she once started making it only to realize she was out of mustard powder so she used curry instead, liked it better and had been using it ever since.  I asked when that was.  ""Oh ages ago,  when your brothers were little."" 

My brothers are all at least 16 yrs older than me.  She's given me the original recipe not the one I'd been eating my whole life.

Texting in front of me &gt; don't value what I'm saying &gt; don't value learning

Here's the test case that shows the ego: would the teacher feel annoyed by seeing a student not paying attention if it was because that student was reading a coursebook? Judging by these guys' attitudes, I'd guess ""yes."" It's not about learning for them. It's about ""showing respect"" to your ""superior."" Fuck that noise.

If you wanna ban students from doing things that distract other students (cell phones included), that's totally legit! That's disrespectful because it's directly contrary to what the teacher and the other students are trying to do. That said, if the behavior in question isn't a disruption to other students, just let 'em go at it. It's their life, their education, and their brain. If they decide to do things that interfere with their learning, it's foolish and immature to take that as a personal slight against the teacher or the institution of learning. There could be many, many reasons that have nothing to do with personal contempt that a student would not pay attention in class."
JoshuaIan,eu4,1390503901.0,"This isn't true at all. Sorry dude. 

All you really need is enough of a standing army to handle the rebels. I had everything east of the Mississippi river when I westernized in my Lenape game, converted to catholicism about 60% of the way through, and it wasn't even really all that difficult.

Just have 6-7 15 stacks of troops, and rotate them around so that none of your stacks take too big of a manpower hit, be diligent about converting provinces, and it's actually quite easy. I got lucky too, my leader turned out to be a 5 pip maneuver general, but given how bad I crushed the rebels every time, I don't think that was necessary at all.

Other things that can be helpful include stationing your armies on the provinces being converted, or even spending MIL to reduce revolt % chance. Also, of course, banking a few grand worth of monarch points in all 3 categories before hitting the westernize button is very necessary.

Honestly though I think the biggest thing that helped me was banking over $5k before reforming the government. This lets you load up on the temples, marketplaces, and constables you'll need to make ends meet during the westernization attempt. If you're broke and reform, you'll either end up having to disband your entire army, or hemmorage cash hand over foot...either will kibosh your westernization.

I go out there, not as if I am 6' tall, but within a normal size range (even if from a purely statistical standpoint I am unusually short for a male).

I'm in grad school currently and my department gives me a tuition waiver for my GTA work, in addition to an $18k / year living stipend (which very easily covers housing in the midwest).  My interest is deferred (doesn't accumulate) while I remain at least a part-time student, and I don't have to pay anything towards the loan during that time.  I'm going to re-apply to the same grad school and get another master's when I'm done with my current one, and by then I should be fully qualified for a $100k - $150k / year entry level job in addition to having enough professional contacts that can put in a good word wherever I apply to work.  The degree I'm presently working on is math and the one I'm aiming for after that is computer science.

It can be done, but it certainly takes a lot of hard work on the part of the student.  And it is necessary to begin preparing pretty quickly after you enter middle- or high-school."

The US government have been supporting the corporatism of the US for too long, trying to fight propoganda sewn during the cold war - that government organisation is bad and capitalism is great.

I have; and as a Brit, let me tell you - it's horse shit fantasy.

Imagine someone came along and wrote a brilliant sci-fi book about how great Socialism was, and made loads of straw-man characters and events to portray Socialism ina great light - and everyone was like ""oh yeah, that's a good story, but the real world just doesn't work like that""

Atlas Shrugged is the capitalist version of that.

It's fairly obvious that Mata's transfer is used by Wenger as an *example* of the January transfer window - a transfer window Wenger has been against for years. Of course he would respect another manager for doing smart business within the rules. It is the very rules he is critisising. Too bad so many journalists haven't done their research.

Ensurdagen,Greyhounds,1390504013.0,"1. Probably, but be ready to clean up spills for a few months until they get used to this and occasionally afterwards--like any dog without free access outside. They will also rip up anything that looks fun when they are bored and you are gone, you might consider keeping them in an area where this is a minimal issue with barricades when you aren't paying attention to them.

2. Ask your foster kennel operators, every dog has a unique personality and some only like humans while others will enjoy the company of fellow dogs. If it likes other dogs, you should consider a male and female pair, and might consider getting a male of a different breed because males are generally bigger. Let the dogs meet and play before you adopt the second one!

3. Greyhounds don't require space if you're walking them, this is an issue of your comfort. You will get twice as much hair in everything, but at least it isn't fur!

4. Greyhound owners can be anyone responsible to care for a dog that can't find its own way home very easily.

5. You'll probably want small female(s). Look for low-prey dogs that are good on a leash and don't jump up when they meet new people. If your adoption agency is good, they will know the dogs' personalities and help you pick out the right match. 

6. You don't need a walker, but you might wanna let somebody become your dog's friend while you're at work and occasionally visit if possible. This is just a suggestion, I know some people can't have dogs of their own so it would be beneficial to both them and the dog.

7. Never let a typical greyhound off a leash in an unfenced area! They are very good at quickly getting lost. You don't seem to have enough time or space to train one to be capable of off-leash obedience.

8. Ask if they are safe around small animals, so you can be careful about letting the not-safe ones around small dogs when you are on walks. It might mourn while you're away, if your neighbors can't handle an occasional 5 minute outburst from your dog then it probably isn't a good idea to get a grey. Look for a foster kennel that knows the dogs well and seeks to pair you with a good match--if you're doing all of the choosing, there's something wrong."

raptor6c,AskMen,1390504045.0,"Things like this works out great if you keep looking until you find a person who is open to being with you as you are and they work out poorly if you settle for someone who is closed off and unwilling to help you explore your sexuality and you then try to force yourself to be content with what they are comfortable with.  

'Normality' is just the aggregate average of everyone's individual tastes.  Your tastes are part of what make up the average just as much as people who are closer to whatever the average happens to be.  Just as you feel a desire that you feel is abnormal, there are also women who also feel desires that they might feel are 'abnormal'.  If their abnormal desires happen to compliment yours then the two of you could have a happy, healthy, 'abnormal' sexual relationship with each other and that would be another drop in the great bucket of sexual relationships that make up the the pool that the 'average' relationship is computed from.

It may seem easier to just be 'normal' if you expect that everyone you might potentially date is satisfied with whatever 'normal' is, but I think you'll find that every individual has their own level of compatibility with whatever the 'normal' of sexual expression is and it's rarely exactly 1 to 1.

All that said even if you might prefer to approach sex a certain way you should still be able to employ the most common techniques and behaviors as most people start out with new partners employing the more common stuff and then as they get to know each other better branch out into the more 'abnormal' stuff that interests each of them.  You've never had sex so you have a poorly formed idea what you'll like or not like due to lack of hands on experience, however given your fantasies it would be prudent not to let your first sexual experience paint too strong of an image of how all sexual experiences might go."

Also I understand what you mean about the supply logistics for the Imperial army though it still doesn't dismiss the fact that there was not one Imperial in the military that was not human (or possibly Mandelorian clone). Other species could have been represented as officers and support workers.  In the case of the Rebels the only reason the Mon Calamari appear to be there is because they bought their way in with their ships and the one Sullustan was there because Lando had a lot of pull.

Taking the PT into account there was indeed plenty of multiculturalism present. But I feel like the separatist rebellion might have sparked xenophobia since they were primarily made up of non-human species. Maybe following their defeat non-humans took a negative attitude toward either joining or even fighting against the Imperials, seeing rebellion as hopeless. Humans in the other hand were in the winning side before the Rebellion collapsed  "

If I worked out one day, and then played a hockey game that same night, I would be bagged, my legs would feel like lead, and it was generally not a pleasant experience.  As a result I stopped going to the gym on days I played games.

However, this year I've really challenged myself to have a ""no exceptions"" rule for going to the gym, and sure enough, four times already I've had games that fell on the same day I had a day at the gym.  The first two games were murder, and I hated it.  

But I pressed on, and my third game felt better, and then my most recent game on Monday was a walk in the park, in fact, I felt better playing that game than I have playing any other game.

8245a,relationship_advice,1390504152.0,"""I don't know what it is. We are crazy in love, are best friends, and seriously can't live without each other. I would give my life for him in a heartbeat. But why the fuck can I not get turned on by him? ""

Reflecting now, I've found through experience, that the less ""best-friendship"" you have between you and your partner the more you will be turned on by them. Try to keep that distant, I know that sounds weird.

Anytime someone would become my best friend later in the relationship it physically became uncomfortable to have sex with them, a few times (at least two past partners I can remember) joked that it would be impossible to rape me because it started getting too tight to penetrate. I think it was my body and subconscious mind that started shutting down those working parts, because they were working just fine in the beginning of the relationship.

When I've been in a relationship where I'm absolutely clear that I was not his best friend and never going to be his best friend, sex was good and consistent. Separate those roles,  it sounds weird but it might be worth giving it a shot.

""Mark"" might be an example of your pent-up sexual urges being triggered by a male role who is not your best friend. Your fiancé is playing the role of your best friend, kind and gentle, and not your lover."

RobOneXL,hockey,1390504157.0,"I have a 4 year old son who has been skating for a year and taking a hockey class for 4 months now. One thing I have noticed about youth hockey players is how supportive and kind they are to one another. I grew up playing baseball. Played my whole life until I was 19. Little league on up was nothing like I have seen at the rink.

My son loves hockey always has. Since he was 2 months old sitting on my lap with me watching games. The minute he started ice skating he wanted to wear his Kings jersey and his hockey gloves every time he went out on the ice. When he went out for open skating and saw kids in their gear and uniforms he would skate after them and talk to them. Didnt matter if the kid was a teenager or the kid was his age. Every single time they will talk with him and even skate with him. If I was 15 years old no way would I want to skate around the rink with a 3 or 4 year old. But they take the time to talk to him and have a good time with him. They remember his name and every time we go to the rink there are 2 or 3 kids there that he knows. His hockey class is right after the pee wee team practices. So those kids are coming off the ice as he goes on. As he waits for them to all get off they come off tapping his pads and giving him fist bumps. He gets a huge kick out of it. Now during open skate they look for him and go and talk to him. Over the last 3 months he has made 2 new friends. If they are at an open session together they are inseparable the whole session. His 2 new friends are brothers a 10 year old and a 14 year old. They both know I like him to work on his skating a little during open session. So they skate backwards with him while they play tag. They help him with his crossover. It blows me away every time. Hockey parents on the other hand."

Well, my mom was out of town and my dad made lasagna for dinner and didn't really know what to do, but he wanted me to have something to eat. So... he put the lasagna in the blender. It was still piping hot and it was liquified. He gave it to me and I *tried* to eat it, but it was like a hot pile of vomit and just made me gag.

I feel so bad now because I was crying (I was a *huge* crybaby) and my dad was getting really stressed and upset trying to find me something to eat and just didn't know what to do. But at the same time it's so hilarious that it even happened in the first place :P"

Being traded is tantamount to being told that you can't help the team, and if you were essentially told you weren't capable of helping a last-place team, wouldn't you be pissed off?

Kaisharga,changemyview,1390504497.0,"That you call it ""cheating"" is revealing, like you feel like people who use audiobooks are doing less work for the same experience that you get by doing something that's harder. They're gaming the system, doing something not in the spirit of the creators, something unfair; and it's something you feel is less morally justifiable than what you choose to do.

Let's pull that apart a bit.

I'll spare you the deconstruction of the ""same experience"" bit, others have covered that in other comments better than I would.

Is reading ""harder?"" Would you instead listen to a book if you felt like you had the option; would it be easier, moral standards notwithstanding? Is it some kind of significant effort, something that exhausts you? Note that it activities can be exhausting *and* gratifying.

Barring any discussion of ""you can't know the writer's intentions"" (which gets us absolutely nowhere), how is it that an audiobook violates the spirit of the implicit agreement between author and reader/listener? Perhaps it's that one person, one voice, narrates the entire book, and that it's a voice that someone else decided on rather than the voice(s) of your imagination; or perhaps it's that some of the work of interpreting the text has already necessarily been done in the manner of applying speech inflection. Does this break from what you expect a book to be?

Is it unfair? Do people who listen to audiobooks spend less time with a book than you do, or do they glean more meaning easier than you do when reading? Can they perhaps churn through more books by listening in a given time, while losing no value? And, significantly, are you unable to reap these rewards yourself through some obstacle to the audiobook-listening process?

And the moral question: Is it a moral good to read books rather than hear them being read? This is difficult to specify without retreading the other questions, and as such I'd hope you'd settle on answers to them and then reevaluate your answer to this question.

I can't answer any of these for you. This I place here as a tool for you to discover what you actually think, and for you to use in analyzing your own feelings on the matter. It is not out of laziness I say this, but, if you find you care to, Change Your Own View."

devonclaire,Dogtraining,1390504514.0,"Treats, treats, treats. Think about how you taught her to sit inside: You probably used treats when you first started. 

So, get out her leash and her favorite treats. Leash her up, and ask her to ""sit"" while inside, but on a leash. When she does it, give her a treat. Now, go outside. Not far from your house — the front porch will work. Show her the treat, ask her to sit. If she sits, then give her a treat. Walk her a few yards from your house, show her the treat, and ask her to sit. If she sits, then give her a treat. Work your way up to bringing treats on walks, so she learns how to sit while in a variety of situations outside. 

If all of this works, then you gradually phase out the treats. That is, after she *masters* ""sit"" while on a walk, you can give her a treat for every other time you ask her to sit. Then, it can just be at random times. 

If any of this doesn't work — for instance, you take her out on the front porch and she won't sit for you, even after seeing the treat, then you need to start over. Try going inside, standing near the door with the door cracked open just a little bit, and ask her to sit. Once she gets that, then ask for a sit when she's inside, but the door is fully open. Once she gets that, then work your way to the front porch. 

The key is to make this gradual, and to reward her for doing what you want. Dogs are very specific. You have to teach her that ""sit"" can be done outside, too, and she will get treats if she does it. "

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1390504606.0,"One thing that this, and almost all other videos arguing against the minimum wage overlook, is that labor is relatively inelastic. If you can hire 2 people instead of 3, why wouldn't you in the first place? I under stand in some instances, extra workers can increase productivity, but honestly, since the goal of employers is already to get the most out of their workers while paying them the least possible, it doesn't make sense for employers to have a whole lot of extra overhead in the first place. If employers need a job done, it will get done, period. And as long as they're making a profit, they will pay the money to get the job done, regardless of the value of the labor.

I'd argue the value of labor is somewhat subjective anyway, and determined by market conditions. Influence the market conditions, and you influence the value of labor. 

I admit, some people WILL be let go due to the minimum wage, but I don't necessarily think that the relationship between the price of labor and employment is linear due to the inelasticity of labor.  It's probably hyperbolic to a degree, where small changes have little effect, although larger changes can have a more dramatic effect. I think that in raising the minimum wage, we should try to be mindful of the negative changes this will have, but in a lot of cases I strongly believe that raising the wage will have a much larger positive effect than a negative one. Without a statutory minimum wage at all, I'd argue that labor would become exploitative, with businesses pocketing massive amounts of saved money while preying on the desperation of the poor. So I don't necessarily think the argument is that we should eliminate the wage and rely on market forces, but that we should act with careful forethought of the consequences of doing so, and make sure we're doing more good than harm, and I stand by this position, even in a basic income society, as some of you know. Yes, I know it supposedly cuts off the bottom of the economic ladder, but I still believe having one does ultimately more good than bad.

I do agree that relying on market capitalism alone is a VERY crappy way of taking care of the poor. Rather, we need a basic income, and then we need to have wages to encourage social mobility. I personally believe in a basic income society we can relax the minimum wage a bit, but I still think it plays an important part of imposing a statutory bottom in order to avoid a race to the bottom, which I believe could happen in a basic income society. To me it's not a matter of whether we should have a min wage, it's what should the wage be."

acetakesphotographs,analog,1390504627.0,"I like how you're projecting a tired conversation onto my point. I never used the word ""pure"" and I never said that the point of analog is to create a perfect rendition. I only made the point that it's silly to shoot film if you are going to spend all sorts of time digitally re-rendering and modifying it. 

I'm glad you made my argument for me. I'm not talking about film as it used to be, I'm talking about film as it is now. Why go through all the trouble of shooting film, scanning film, and then manipulating it if all you get is a crappy 5 megapixel scan. People shoot analog *now*, even though digital exists, because they want to shoot something simple and like the analog process. Why would you want to shoot film if you're going to be modifying the composition, removing and editing to your liking? Just shoot digital in the first place. For the majority of people scanning is just a means to share, not a means to create digital images. If I want to create digital images and spend 4 hours in photoshop I just use my digital camera. I'd much rather spend that time shooting and composing an image that doesn't need little hunks removed or this that and the other thing. I'd also rather spend that time in the darkroom.

Shoot film for whatever reason you want but you're making a shitty argument if your argument is that ""film used to be that way"". Making the argument that people used to edit film and manipulate it and therefore it's ok is just as stupid as arguing that analog is somehow a more pure process. You're approaching it from a justified and jaded concept. Do whatever you like, it's your time, but I prefer to shoot film within the context of digital. Not in spite of it, because it's more ""pure"" (words you put into my mouth), and most certainly not to spend time in photoshop editing and modifying my photos.

With you being a believer I have a hard time believing you are capable of properly separating was is and is not fact.

Evolution has evidence and demonstrable facts backing it, that is why it is taught. Religion does not.

College level if they want to go study about society and religions fine, but in Elementary, Middle and High school they need to be focusing on simply reading, writing and math considering the US in behind most every other developed nation in those regards.

There is plenty of evidence that including religion in any capacity in public schools inevitable causes strife and discord, we are in fact commenting on just such an occasion. And there is a plethora of evidence to suggest that religion should be excluded in it's entirety based only on it's effects on the followers. Not mentioning the severe lack of evidence and/or facts within it's texts."

tangerinelion,buildapc,1390504750.0,"In general, random restarts are hard to diagnose.

One is software.  I had a friend whose WiFi driver was the source of restarts.  It happened randomly but was most likely to happen under high network load.  Even reinstalling your OS won't necessarily help you here.  However if you can install a completely different OS and it behaves normally then software is likely to be your issue.

An important part on software: You say it restarts over and over.  If it is getting into the OS and restarting after some amount of time (maybe just a few minutes), then the idea of software could make sense.  But if it is restarting before the OS even tries to load then it makes no sense whatsoever.  If it restarts while loading the OS it is possible it is picking up a bad driver so trying a software based approach makes sense.

One is temperature.  If a component overheats it ceases to function and then causes the machine to restart.  CPU, GPU, and chipset are the most common suspects here.  Obviously if any of these are overclocked you should reset them to their stock speeds and settings.  The chipset temperature is probably the hardest to measure, but the CPU and GPU are easily monitored in software.  One thing to try here is removing all the dust from your GPU and your CPU's cooler.  

The other culprit is PSU.  I've had this happen and it is tricky to figure out.  Sometimes a PSU will simply die on you and you have no idea why, but it's important to understand that PSUs have very large capacitors inside them and they take the full power of your system plus more due to their inefficiency (80% efficient PSUs mean that if your components draw 400W your PSU draws 500W from the outlet and that extra 100W goes largely into heat).  Even monitoring voltages won't necessarily help you because perhaps your PSU has always run your +12V line at +11.65V and if you've never paid attention this looks like a problem when it isn't.  On top of that if this is your issue you may only see the +12V line, for example, running at +11.6V for a while then it restarts.  It could have restarted because your +12V line dropped abruptly to +10V, at which point it restarts and the voltage monitoring software can't register that since it's already crashed.  To really monitor your voltage you need to use a multimeter and shove that in your molex connector you're not using.  But even this is tricky in a multi-rail PSU since your +12V may be split into three different circuits and while two of them are A-OK your third one is only a single PCIe connector that your GPU is using.  You can't measure it, but if that's your problem then you wouldn't be able to rule out the PSU and instead have to rely on putting a new PSU in and just hoping the problem goes away.  (In my case, I had no clear evidence the PSU wasn't working normally but put in a different one and it worked just fine so I only determined the PSU was at fault when the problem couldn't be duplicated with a new PSU).

Lastly there's the possibility of a memory issue.  You can try pulling a stick of RAM, or trying different slots.  You should also run Memtest86+ (eg, from a USB stick or linux disc).  In principle you should have noticed this early with general system instability, but it's also possible that some memory cells just went bad on you (somewhat more likely if running at high voltages).

In order, I'd check temperature, PSU, software, RAM."

You're right, it isn't comparable. Women can't control their periods, but men can control their diet. If menstruation is considered impure then by default women are also impure, because menstruation is an unavoidable part of being a woman! This is a prime example of gender discrimination. Furthermore, the religion and culture are so intertwined it's pointless to claim that this sort of thing is religious-based only.

absinthevisions,relationship_advice,1390504943.0,"First thing you need to do is make sure she is in fact pregnant. Go to the OBGYN with her, take her down to your local health department or Planned Parenthood and get a test. 

Second, the two of you need to discuss all of your options. Abortion, adoption, and parenting. Voice your opinions but be aware that the ultimate choice is hers but it's your job to support it. Since she already has children her choice will likely be parenting. 

Should she or both of you chose to parent you need to make sure that you are the father. There is a blood test that can be done as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy but it is very expensive and is not covered by insurance. If you chose not to go that route you will have to wait until birth to be sure. Do not sign anything acknowledging the child as yours until you have results of a DNA test. If the child turns out to be yours you will need a lawyer to set up an order of custody (you should request shared/joint), a visitation agreement, and a support order. Child support is based on your income and although it varies from state to state it's usually around 35% of your income.  This agreement should be revisited anytime a party moves a long distance, around when the child starts school, and then every few years as life changes.

You will also need to man up and talk to your friend. Just be honest and receptive to how he feels. 

Good luck to you!"

**[Reflets dans l'eau](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0Hyq4Xc7Q8)**

One of the more beautiful pieces for piano that exist. Name translates as ""Reflections on the Water.""

**[Preludes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYbCnbo8OxE)**

Don't be scared by the length of this video! These are individually very short pieces and it would be easier for you to listen on Spotify. These are some awesome works that are all over the place and were cutting edge for their time. They're short and each is singularly focused on a different idea, so they're great for people just getting into classical.

**[Sunken Cathedral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAVyKDDsM3s)**

Just gorgeous. 

Also, more French music from around the same time:

**[Ravel - Introduction  and Allegro for harp, flute, clarinet, and quartet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBm1w8J63mg&amp;list=PLM5l37iBPDsQW3KG_LrEiqqLqiSYV_hii)**

Another stunning piece with some absolutely insane harp work. Ravel is a genius of orchestration, the art of the use of the instruments themselves to create colors and textures.

**[Poulenc - Gloria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iihiRUyvu1I)**

This work is amazing! It's in a few different movements. Each movement is a special little portrait of its own.

**[Poulenc - Melancholie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG_pMHOF8ME)**

Beautiful piano music.

**[Chopin - Ballade No. 4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tmQSWuYwrI)**

I might be getting carried away here and this is a little earlier than the other stuff, but it's probably my favorite Chopin work. It's stunning if you have time to sit down and listen to the whole thing; it's a roller coaster ride.


Sorry if that was too long, but there's just such a wealth of amazing music out there and it's a shame that people don't want to or don't know how to look farther than Clair de Lune, which is a pretty piece, but not necessarily my favorite."

There is so many basic things that he just completely overlooks, and the only reason he was the largest exchange was just sheer luck. He acts like a small business owner, and not the owner of a multinational currency exchange platform. 

I remember when it was getting DDoS'ed I wanted to strangle him. I had to explain that a multimillion dollar operation needs to act like a multimillion dollar operation. He then tried to tell me that this company isn't that large, so I grabbed the data that's publicly available and forced him to concede that, ""Okay, we are pretty big.""  He reminds me a lot like the non-business savvy first generation immigrant small business owners. You know, those guys that open up small shops in the city? Usually everything is overpriced and their service is abysmal while they nickle and dime you on everything. But they do okay business because they are the only people in town. Then a real business owner opens up shop down the street where everything looks nice, offers great customer support, and is really friendly with everyone. These guys start taking all their business, and the immigrant owners can't understand why they are losing all their business. They can't comprehend that they need to maintain their reputation and brand within the community. 

This is MagicalTux. I'm telling you, just talk to the guy and you'll quickly realize he doesn't give a flying shit about anything. He's already making decent money and sort of doesn't really care about being efficient. His method is sort of, ""Don't worry about it. I'll get it working when I get it working.

sevenbridge,unitedkingdom,1390505067.0,"Civil engineering student, I'm no expert on concrete but here's what I would do:

Obviously, get as much out as quickly as possible. Hopefully this gets most of it out, and then rinse the rest down. There are machines that can pump concrete, which would be ideal to use, but I'm not sure how safe it is to use them with setting concrete.

Failing that, [this](http://www.na.graceconstruction.com/custom/concrete/downloads/TB_0106.pdf) suggests that concrete hydration (i.e. setting) stops at temperatures of around -3 to -4°C, so I would probably run a load of pipe carrying something fucking cold through it, like liquid nitrogen, and find a way of keeping the room at those temperatures.

Beyond that, adding loads of sand/aggregate into the mix to the point that there's too much for the cement to bind together should stop it from setting solid, but you'll have difficulty mixing it in properly and into the corners whilst it's on the floor like that.

Either way; expensive."

DieMensch-Maschine,classicalmusic,1390505118.0,"First found out about Zelenka when I was researching the court of Augustus II the Strong (+1733), the Elector of Saxony.  Zelenka came to prominence when Augustus converted to Catholicism in order to be crowned the King of Poland.  With his conversion, Augustus' court in Dresden became bi-confessional, with Zelenka taking responsibility for composing music for Catholic liturgies.  For the past decade, I cannot think of a single composer that I have listened to more and whose recordings I have sought out with greater zeal.  I keep reading comments about Bach having a more universal appeal or being more relevant, but none of this has any kind of bearing for me as an individual listener.  At the risk of sounding blunt, for me, Bach's work sounds Protestant, its sobriety standing in stark contrast to Zelenka's almost otherworldly sensuality.  Recordings of his work can sometimes be a trial to find (reading ability of Czech is a definite plus), since labels like Nibiru or Supraphon aren't terribly adept at mass marketing.

everyonelikesnoodles,AskReddit,1390505226.0,"So, I would never say that I don't like porn. It's undeniably stimulating and can absolutely enhance sexual experiences. With respect to your question, I completely understand that reactions to porn are completely visceral and subjective so I can't and won't make sweeping statements on behalf of all women. However, there are definitely times when my reactions to porn can range from annoyed, to angry to just flat out depressed by what I see. My strongest reactions are to sexual positions or behaviors that would be physcially and/or emotionally uncomfortable for a lot of women. While I realize that porn stars are 'acting' and that porn is a fantasy, that doesn't really do anything to pacify my reactions to certain things. That said, here are some examples of the things I react very negatively to and why- **Bukkaki:** Some women may love being the center of attention but there is no circumstance under which I can imagine being physically stimulated by this or feeling good about myself while it was happening or after. **Girl on girl scene, long fingers nails routing around inside the vagina:** This would be painful in real life and every time I see it, I cringe. **Gagging:** This actually pisses me off. Blow jobs are one thing, but this just looks like face rape. The pleasure-giver is not really giving pleasure but is on the receiving end of a physically uncomfortable experience. **Ass to Mouth:** I find this extremely degrading and intended to shame the woman. This one is really disturbing to me and there is nothing about it that I find interesting on a fantasy level. **Foreign Objects:** I love a good sex toy and they definitely have their place in porn. However, representations of inserting random foreign objects into a woman's orifices, vaginal or anal, represent another form of degradation for me. Reddit had a .gif the other day of a woman pushing a cell phone in and out of her vagina. The idea that the vagina is just a hole to be filled by anything is repugnant to me and I'm disturbed by represntations that promote this. **Choking:** Representations of sex that look more like rape are just intolerable to me. **Spitting:** So many other fun ways to get the vagina ready. Why this? **Double Penetration:** I imagine this feels like being ripped apart and therefore can't watch these scenes. I've mentioned these things as many of them have crossed over into 'mainstream' porn and are no longer just fetish porn. Very subtly, it seems that mainstream porn has become increasingly aggressive and rough towards women and I find all of the aforementioned unwatchable. "

CC-Rider,Music,1390505316.0,"&gt; i think the measure of a piece of classical music's quality is probably in it's mass appeal.

I'm going to have to disagree rather strongly here. Mass appeal in and of itself is not a negative, but to me it is not a marker of supreme quality. Much classical music is challenging, engaging, long, etc. and these are all things that hurt mass appeal while simultaneously making it so rewarding, cathartic, eye-opening, and all the other things classical can be. Clare de Lune is a pretty piece, but there's a reason it has mass appeal; it's short so it doesn't take a huge amount of focus, it's fairly singular in mood, and it isn't particularly challenging to modern ears. It's not bad, but to me it's just not as great as so many other Debussy works."

jaredjeya,technology,1390505373.0,"Of course I understand the difference. But as files become bigger, latency is less relevant. A hypothetical 1-bit package takes the latency to travel to it's destination fully. But a 1Gb video would take the latency plus 1Gb/the speed. Even with 100mb/s that's 8 seconds, which draws the latency by orders of magnitude.

I'm *am* suggesting that less bandwidth-needy applications be allocated slightly less bandwidth, as opposed to what happens now where companies throttle video. 

But I'm *not* suggesting that we put your SSH on hold until my video has buffered completely. But it'd be nice if I could watch a video in real time when it would barely affect other, smaller pieces of data. 

PS: You say ""oh you can buffer"" but YouTube is built to prevent buffering (i.e only lets you buffer a few seconds ahead), and if the bitrate:download speed ratio starts approaching 2 it's almost unwatchable, even given unlimited buffering."

ctesibius,motorcycles,1390505839.0,"I don't recommend the oil in the cylinder trick on a modern bike. This dates back to when bikes didn't have air filters, and it was likely that at least one inlet valve was left open, allowing moist air in. Putting a little oil in and spreading it around stopped the bore rusting. However if the bike has an original airbox, it doesn't need this. 

A couple of examples: I once got my Dad's old Excelsior running after 13 years off the road. That had a very crude nylon mesh air filter and no air box. The piston rings were rusted to the bore and I had to use a mallet to free them off. In contrast I've recently got a more modern bike with an air box and filter running after 11 years off the road. The bores were in perfect condition.

It's true that adding a little oil is unlikely to damage the bores, but it may oil up the plugs and make the bike harder to start, hence I'd recommend not doing it.

Battery chargers: my feeling is that if you don't use a maintenance charger and the bike is in long term storage, the battery will eventually die. I've been using a couple of Optimate 4 chargers for about six months, and I like them, although they are hardly necessary if you keep the bikes in use. I've not heard of them damaging batteries. However I would not recommend the Oxford Maximiser. You can't tell from the display whether the charger is plugged in as it will steal power from the battery if it doesn't get it from the mains. The result is that your charger flattens you battery in a couple of days. Eventually you will make this mistake!"

They are. Did you watch the video I linked? Regardless of consent, they are being sexually objectified. That's it. Giving consent does not mean they aren't being objectified. Simple, really. I don't have a problem with these women choosing to do this, I have a problem with the nature of the image and the fact that it exists. 

Look, men can react however they damn well please to seeing a woman's body, that does not mean I have to agree with the way they go about it. These comments are downright gross! Seriously. It's creepy. But it's so normalized no one bats an eye. 

I obviously have had sexual thoughts toward a person. That's not my point. 

I'm not bitter, I have opinions that I am not afraid to be let known and stand for.

I was the runner, and at that time had not had any chigger bites, and I had never heard of them either. So when the swimmer got to me, I took off. There was no exact set course to follow, you just had to get from A to B in the fastest time. At one point I came upon a field just full of tall grass. Everyone was running around it, which would have taken longer. I saw the opportunity to get ahead and said, ""What the hell, let's do it."" Big mistake. So I cut through the field no problem and got to the end. That night was probably the worst night of my life.

skatastrophy,financialindependence,1390506096.0,"Additionally, look into 72t distributions (SEPP) to avoid early withdrawal penalties.

Your buddy is talking about it this way: You skip paying whatever taxes you currently pay in your tax bracket (assume 25%) and your money grows tax free for x number of years. When you withdraw your money early you'll be paying a 10% penalty for early withdrawals, as well as income tax (assuming 15% since we're talking about FIRE here). 

The challenge I have with any of the above is that it's assuming that tax rates stay the same, and that the government doesn't modify the rules around 401ks and IRAs. I'm not willing to bet on that, so I personally diversify my funds across a number of vehicles (Roth, Traditional IRA, 403b, 401k, Taxable account).

Pre-BNW you absolutely had to go tall for cultural victories. Now it matters much, much less. Cultural victories mean accumulating tourism. This is done in a couple of ways, but the most basic way is gathering art and artifacts.

Each piece of art or artifact require a place to put them. Most of the culture buildings have a slot for a piece of art/artifact, writing, or music. Museums have two (art). On the other hand, many wonders have slots, so if you go tall you're dependent on those wonders to have enough slots to fill with art. With a wide empire, you're alleviated of that need.

However, I'd still suggest that cultural victories are fairly wonder dependent. Anything that provides additional slots is usually very helpful. Those wonders often come with a free work of art or a free musician/artist/writer (which can be translated to make the same). And, even more importantly, as GP points out - you want to deny your opposition the opportunity to get these wonders as well."

No, no, no, no no no no no no. Taking a charge has nothing to do with planting your feet. Here's the rule explanation:

""Generally, the ball-carrier committed a charge if all of the following are true:

- The defender was still, or moving sideways or backward but not forward, when contact occurred.

- The defender took a legal guarding position before the contact, that is, one with both feet on the floor.

- The defender was hit on the torso (as opposed to the arm or leg).

In the NBA, in contact during a move to the basket, officials do not consider the position of the defender's feet, but decide whether the defensive player's torso was set in position before the offensive player began his upward motion"""

Dionysusigma,masseffect,1390506492.0,"I think this is a good idea, but a few hurdles beyond having the HUD in every shot (like the early Red v. Blue vids) and such come to mind.

1. The music is... notably lacking (not quality, but presence) for a huge portion of the game. You might want to find some good sources to augment the already-present tracks... maybe from the later games. Not necessarily the major themes for important bits (like the Genophage Cure music with female vocalist from ME:3), but say the bits of music from fight scenes that might've been overlooked (overlistened?) from the later games. For instance, the [music during the final push to Okeer's lab in 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_fJhPiNkR4&amp;t=3m6s) struck me as wonderfully epic, but I almost didn't hear it because I had Blue Suns Heavies blasting me with rockets a good portion of the time. Or, the [music from Thane's passing,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cewfbVxnfUE) or the [London FOB](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FThM3RnUUvU), that are also amazingly beautiful, but only used once in the entire trilogy. (And other sources, especially games, could work too - for instance, and I'm jumping the sharknado on this one, if [Kasumi's music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9lLd0rBwyQ) isn't enough you could also [pull from Deus Ex Human Revolution if you need more interesting music to go with her viewing Keiji's memories.](http://youtubedoubler.com/bveM))


2. Camera angles. ME:2 and 3 did a far better job of [Framing](http://www.mediacollege.com/video/camera/tutorial/01-framing.html) than what occurred in 1, lending themselves to a more cinematic feel. Don't give into laziness and use the same angles and spacing for everything and everyone - faster than you'd think, it becomes boring and predictable, even though it's a subtle issue. Consider the [Hanar preacher scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0UrqXNAA9s) from ME:1: the same two shots, over and over, with a stationary camera, resulting in a flat and quickly-tiresome ordeal. Now, [the Biotic God](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH-8fzQechY) from 2: a moving camera, a wide variety of frame compositions, different shots during the same line of dialogue, and so forth - it comes out more visually appealing (i.e. interesting) from a film standpoint.


3. Pacing. Action scenes in movies are directed to be entertaining for the viewer, keeping a delicate balance of timing (via creative editing) and eye-candy to maintain interest. In a game, especially a squad-strategy based game like ME, the player is focused on the mechanics of the fight as the entertainment rather than ""if it looks cool."" Figuring out how much to use each scene is something that is an art in and of itself. Watch a few of [FreddieW's videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/freddiew) for a bit of fight-pacing inspiration.

CornyHoosier,books,1390506607.0,"Story time:

When I was a child I used to HATE reading. I hated it so much that my mother was informed I was falling behind the rest of the class significantly in both writing and reading. The town I lived in had a population of 360 people and didn't have a single library (not that she could get me to read even if there was).

My mother, being the smart woman she is, began taking me with her when she would drive to the ""big city"" (pop 15,000) to do grocery shopping. She placed me in front of the comic book stand and told me I was only allowed to have *one* comic. She says that I would cheer everytime she said it was grocery day because I would then get to buy another one. Within a year of doing this I had apparently advanced to the best reader and writer in the class.

Fast forward to now. I still own every comic book she ever bought me, I own multiple shelves of books and actually picked my downtown apartment because it was near the Indianapolis library.

I think Americans just need to have their imagination for books reignited. The knowledge gained and emotions of a book are 100x as powerful as reality television."

UseKnowledge,LawSchool,1390506613.0,"&gt; Doing it untimed isn't really going to tell you much about your relative strengths and weaknesses within the test.

I have to disagree with you on that. When you take it untimed, you figure out what you really don't know and what just takes you a longer time to figure it. This helps you allocate your time on which areas you should focus on. Maybe you can get parallel flaws right, but you just need that extra 30 seconds. Perhaps you just utterly fail on grouping games, even with a lot of time, so you should work on how to tackle them to a greater degree.

Fast forward 20 minutes, everyone else is about to be finished eating and I'm still waiting for my dish. Finally, here he comes... With the same fucking wrong dish that I wasn't eating in a million years. I wanted to punch that guy, but of course I was being polite.


Second time, same restaurant chain (Jensen's Bøfhus in Denmark for whoever might care) I asked where my food was when the waiter was done serving everyone else at the table. He asked what food. (I do not stutter, he even repeated the order when he was taking the order). So he quickly apologises and says he make sure it's sorted out. Fast forward 20 minutes, I walk up and ask where my food was. They'd forgotten it. Again.

Every time I've tried to play a character as smarter, I over think it and tend to second guess myself, convinced that any idea my character comes up with is smarter than my own first idea. This often completely stymies me as I try to think of something I wouldn't think of. 

Instead of WHAT a smart character thinks, I instead try to focus more on HOW a smart character thinks. In particular, what kind of thought processes they prefer. They tend to not be action oriented, but rather will work through many possibilities, because theorycrafting is fun for them. Also, they absorb knowledge because they love to geek out about their expertise. They absorb new experiences like they were crack. They get EXCITED about knowledge. Or tactics, or what have you.

He's not saying husbands should force their wives to submit. He's saying it should be a choice. Sure, the guy is at the top of the family power structure, but that doesn't mean he has to be a controlling asshole. He is just charged with the job of protecting the family and making sure everyone has their needs met. This isn't some horrible conspiracy. He expressed his beliefs in a book he wrote which is protected speech. He's not advocating against women, he's discussing his religious beliefs. Making fun of his religion, especially for a piece that is often purposely exaggerated and taken out of context, is disrespectful. If we, as women, want our rights taken seriously, we have to respect the rights of others we don't agree with.

Pete won't be able to help himself, just as he couldn't stop himself from dragging the barrel scene to (what felt like) interminable length.  Same with the Smaug scenes.  I love Tolkien, and I have loved Jackson's movies, but I was yawning by the end of Desolation.  Action just for the sake of action loses its *umph*.

Jackson should consider taking a page from Mel Gibson's book.  The Battle of Stirling Bridge scene from Braveheart is awesome, but it only takes up something like 8 minutes of screen time, and that includes kilt-mooning and trash talking.  I wonder if you combined all of the battle scenes from Braveheart how long would they last.  I'm betting they wouldn't add up to the amount of time spent watching dwarfs run around the Lonely Mountain with Smaug chasing them. I was stoked for Desolation, but seriously, I thought I was going to fall asleep.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390506928.0,"Well maybe there's some value to the concept of class warfare, especially when policies explicitly benefit a privileged class while hurting the poorer classes. Am I really supposed to overlook the fact that republican policies blatantly favor the rich and hurt the middle and lower classes? Am I supposed to forget that lower and middle class purchasing power has gone down in recent years? Yes, there is class warfare afoot. But it wasn't the democrats or the left who have declared war.

Also, the thing about Marx, obviously communism is a failed idea, but his critiques of capitalism actually have value. He and his followers just had some really, really awful solutions to the matter. There's a major difference between democrats and American/European leftists and communists, and that's the methods employed to solve the problem. I accept capitalism as a reality, as do democrats and most other leftists. I do not propose a violent overthrow of the elites. That is not to say, however, that I am against Keynesian interventions in the economy, such as the formations of social programs or regulations to improve the lives of workers. Democrats are also for keeping democracy, while, as you have seen, communists end up being rather totalitarian.

If you take away ANYTHING from this conversation about liberal thought, take away THAT. That democrats actually are not communists, and while they may agree  with marx nominally on his criticisms of capitalism, that is not to say that democrats have the same solutions, the difference between a liberal and a marxist is actually night and day. It's the difference between a republican who proposes smaller government and an anarchist who proposes none. I mean, both groups are against big government, but as you can imagine, both have much different ideas. 


Quite frankly, what I want is for America to be much more like it was in your generation, a nation that was strong and prosperous. A nation where both the rich and poor grew together. America is no longer like that, and a lot of it is due to republican policies. Your generation had a strong union presence that kept wages and prosperity high. Jobs were much more plentiful. America isn't like that any more. It's actually starting to resemble what it was back in the days of the gilded age, or the 1920s. We're much more productive, yet we work harder for less. I think we need a new New Deal, and to go back to what made us (and by us, I mean, everyone, not just the super privileged) so prosperous in the first place. My generation is the first in a while that looks like it is going to be worse off than our parents. We need a change in direction. I'm not saying we should go communist, but I do think we need to take a page out of FDR's book."

ReKKanize,RimWorld,1390507006.0,"I'm late to the thread, but maybe add ruins from previous failed colonies. For balance, make stuff irreparable and have to be hauled away, maybe get a bit of metal from it. That way you can either choose to build a new colony or rebuild the ruins (should take about the same time maybe?).


Also raiders with different attack types than just murder everyone they see. Maybe they want to steal resources from the area? Or instead of head on assault, maybe more of a siege type attack with siege weapons. So as to either force you to keep your fortifications in repair until you run out of resources or out to attack the raiders.


Action groups when recruited (maybe remember groups). My latest play through I have about 55 colonists and it's tiring to have to pull out my con-artists all the time. It would also make executing advanced tactics less tiresome.

My reasoning (and it remains today) was that I just didn't buy the idea of some cosmic loving force guiding me along.  I always felt as if that took the ultimate responsibility of who we are as people out of our hands.  It REALLY bothered me.  It also felt dishonest to pay lip-service to something that I didn't believe and knew I never would.

It took me into my mid twenties to discover Buddhism, at least in a meaningful way.  The thing that really made sense to me was that it told me everything was my fault.  I choose to be resentful, I choose to be codependent, I choose to be angry.  By identifying those characteristics as choices I ceased to be a victim of my upbringing.  I opened the door for growth, I could halt relationships that were harmful to me, I could replace all of my negativity with compassion.

It's not for everyone.  I am personally comforted by the idea that there is no hell or heaven.  THIS MOMENT, right now is all we are guaranteed.  What are we doing with it?

As a side note, I don't really think of Buddhism as a religion.  There is no god, it's just a bunch of ideas that a guy came up with to live better, and he taught them to as many people as would listen.  If you have a religion trigger, I would stay away from Diamond Way.  It's kind of structured more as a religion there.  I personally attend services at a local Soto Zen center.  You can find one at szba.org if you are interested.

I'd say I prefer to see investment in the giving and receiving of pleasure to the other person, rather than investment in just creating the appearance of pleasure, coming from both the male and female performers.  
To give a concrete example, a boring porn scene would be one where either person engages in repetitive motions towards the other without some form of observable feedback that the actions are having a pleasurable effect on the other person.  A good scene would be one in which the actions being taken by both partners feel organically linked to the pleasure of both partners.  This can be simulated rather than natural as long as the actors are able to convey the proper amount of feeling that their activities are directly linked to the amount of pleasure they're feeling."

Also, again, reforming a non-strictly evil character to good to some extent is not unusual and as a chaotic neutral character discord can serve as an antagonist and teacher at the same time, which is not an uncommon character archetype.  Also, getting upset because the reason discord was reformed (and that's assuming that there is only one single reason and not simply the fact that it is far better to turn your enemy to good than to destroy them) hasn't been mentioned yet seems pretty silly considering there have only been 12 episodes since that episode aired and three of those episodes were the s3 finale and s4 openers (which discord played a part in)."

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1390507515.0,"""They're jealous of our freedom"" is an outdated, but often used, argument for the War on Terror. If we take a closer look at American foreign policy since its inception, we can see that the United States has generally been a dick to every nation it came across in a manner similar to other existing empires at the time. In fact, most wars fought with US participation can be seen as strategic political moves with the agenda of gaining new land and stealing the resources there.

So it'd be perhaps more honest and less tiresome if politicians just said ""foreigners hate America because we're dicks, and we're going to continue being dicks to them"" with the occasional ""we'll give some folks a bit of material to rebuild if they'll serve our interests"" thrown in."

Coalesced,DnD,1390507563.0,"I loved the flexibility of 4E. As a DM, I ran one of the most enjoyable campaigns - where everyone could participate.

I am surprised at someone playing a game that is lauded as a game for a group of people who have been historically excluded from a lot of popular society now FROTHING that the game is more inclusive. 

""Lowest Common Denominator"" means my friend who's not good with complicated rules but loves to roleplay can play DnD with us now with minimal fuss, Hell yes. **And** he has as much fun as the guy who is a rules lawyer munchkin has, because the rules don't choke you so much if you're bad at them, nor do they give you ridiculous overpowered levels of cheese if you're good at them. (and have a decent DM) 

Encounters are easier (for me to plan), battles are more fun and dynamic.

That complaint this other poster /u/Purehatred has is silly. Everyone has magic powers? That's a function of a lack of imagination. Clearly they have no ability to conceive of difficult concepts such as HP as ablative narrative armor, or prowess bringing you to the level of another player who uses mystical forces. It's a function of different roles and arenas of action being important and useful that 4E shines for many, and leaves people like this Purehatred fellow upset.

Something I *DO* miss from previous editions of the game were the durability of a warrior's role versus the selective use of a mage. While a mage has to hoard spells and hope that he or she will use the right one at the right time, a fighter could keep being solid the entire time provided they husbanded their HP properly. It's something special about the roles that was lost in 4E, where everyone has equal participation, albeit different delivery mechanism, and it is difficult to properly balance and salvage that mechanic."

JustinJamm,Reformed,1390507776.0,"The Old Testament tithe *was not* described as all going to the ""church"" of the time -- neither to the Levites nor to synagogues. So there is no 10%-precedent in the first place. This is really just church tradition using an Old Testament word to justify its tradition.

Rather, the OT tithe used a 3-year ""rotation"":

1. For 2 years, the tithe funded ""maintaining spiritual community,"" which (for the Jews) meant saving up for ongoing pilgrimages to the Jerusalem area for feasts, sacrifices, etc.  
2. Every 3rd year, the tithe went to local needy folks and local Levites.

New Testament ""giving"" (""all they had"" and all that) shows a holistic approach, but does not set a specific standard.

If you want your giving to ""mirror"" the OT structure (which is not a bad goal at all!), consider the following:

* giving 2/3 of the tithe (6.7% or 1/15 of your income) to your local church supports ongoing spiritual community, just like years 1-2 of this 3-year rotation)

* giving 1/3 of the tithe (3.3% or 1/30 of your income) to missionaries/other-full-time-ministry-people (basically Levites!) and need-based causes you support (shelters, etc).

Hoodwink,MensRights,1390507816.0,"To understand America, you have to understand that for the most part, there is no citizen-state interaction, but a market(corporate)-state interaction (or rentier arrangements) in almost all government aid/functions.  Medicaid seems like a direct payment to the citizen to provide health-care, but it's really governed politically by private market actors.  Food stamps is in an agricultural bill that specifically was specifically set out to subsidize farmers (now agricultural corporations).  It's protected politically by agricultural companies.  The recent Food Stamp cut doesn't make any sense until you realize that it was a political act to put someone in their place and not some technocratic act.

Watch the language of almost all national politicians or their mouthpieces.  They say ''consumer'' more than citizen in almost any topic (from food stamps to health insurance).  Back when Obama was doing his campaign back in 2007-8 I was really worried because while spoke in a progressive voice at many prepared speeches; he seemed to speak the language of market-state politicians naturally.

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1390507847.0,"Funny that you should mention this. I was reading about merit-making last night, and I came upon this quote:

Khp8 Nidhi Kanda - The Reserve Fund: “When a man or woman has laid aside a well-stored fund of giving, virtue, restraint, &amp; self-control, with regard to a shrine, the Sangha, a fine individual, guests, mother, father, or elder sibling: That's a well-stored fund. It can't be wrested away. It follows you along. When, having left this world, for wherever you must go, you take it with you. This fund is not held in common with others, &amp; cannot be stolen by thieves”.

This, and other quotes like it, reminds me of Matthew 6:19-21: 

19 “Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moths and vermin destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. 20 But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moths and vermin do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.

I couldn't really make sense of it as a Christian, but it makes more sense to me now as a Buddhist: it's discussing merit (I think some Catholics may call it ""graces"", from what I remember). There are other Buddhist excerpts out there that are translated in a similar way that Bible passages are that make me go ""Ohhh so *that's* what that means.""

fffangold,Libertarian,1390507959.0,"Political parties formed as a result of elections being decided by whoever gets the most votes in a voting system where we can only pick one candidate.

Consider this oversimplified scenario:
You have a liberal, slightly liberal, slightly conservative, and conservative candidate. The two liberal candidates split the vote of liberal leaning Americans, and the conservative candidates split the vote of conservative leaning Americans.

Recognizing this, the two liberal candidates decide the one with the most support should run alone to get more votes and have a better shot at winning, and even though the other won't be running for office, more of his policies will be put into effect than if a conservative won. In response, the conservative candidates do the same.

Second, don't let anyone pressure you into changing your body if you're happy and healthy. Overeating to gain weight is just as unhealthy as starving yourself to lose it. 

The sad fact of life is that people are unempathetic assholes. Just realize that people probably make the jokes not because they think something is wrong with you, but just the opposite.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390508132.0,"&gt; That's not my issue. The issue is how you went about it, with a subtle ""be the better man"" argument.

I'm really not sure what you mean by this. I haven't been ""trying to persuade these CMV redditors to stop this behavior."" I've been trying to explain why this behavior feels unsettling and upsetting to many women. What sorts of things are upsetting, what aren't, and I why I think that's true.

As far as the content of the sex chat, I don't think that really matters as much. That a far more subtle red flag, and if the rest of the context were gone, would be irrelevant. But, just for you own info, here's the deal with that:

Making it a fantasy I have specifically listed I have means that they are at least trying to be considerate of my desires. Being considerate of my desires is a comforting and danger-reducing because it gives me the sense that they would **also** have consideration for my desires in person. So the danger level comes way down. Someone who shows consideration for me isn't dangerous, because then my reactions have meaning. Someone who shows no consideration for me is dangerous, because my reactions have less, if any meaning. *(Not that it is always that simple, but this is how this particular red flag in my warning system works.)*

Not everyone's red flags are going to be the same. We have different experiences that build our armour and warning systems.

I caution against thinking of a forward person, and a person who doesn't care to monitor other people's reactions and adjust their own actions, as the same person. 

It is true that by being forward you lose some of the early signals people give off (in a single encounter) that could prevent you from fucking things up. Being forward means it could take several encounters to figure out how correct behavior so as not to make other people nervous.

But when someone continues to engage in behavior that makes people uncomfortable, that *can be* a red flag.  Doing this shows a lack of consideration for other people's feelings.

Then in what kind of ways, in what situations, they make people feel  uncomfortable and disregard people's feelings becomes important. Maybe it's something fairly harmless, like toilet humor others don't like, or oversharing personal details, or being condescending. 

But when the topic is sex, and someone disregards when, how and with whom you prefer deal sexually, that IS a red flag. That doesn't mean it will amount to anything dangerous. Just that they don't care about how you feel about when, how and with whom you interact sexually.

Serae,rpg,1390508286.0,"I believe once you have played enough and with enough people you find there are many different personality types...and they don't always mesh.

There are played who want to be the center of attention, all power, leader of the group or GTFO.

There are players who like chaos.

There are players who like cooperation between players.

There are players who like a good story but they prefer peace among the group.

I learned that I HATE groups where it is a giant competition for power and constant PvP.  Before a campaign (and not just a one shot) begins I like to talk to played about expectations, comfort zones and house rules.  This usually includes: Your comrades are neither your competition or enemies.  With them you'll be able to get further and do more.  If you cannot get along and work together then you can't play here.

Once upon a time there was a player in a group.  Let's call him Douche-ass.  Douche-ass knew we were players who liked to work as a team, were honest with another and had a good time with that build.  He, on the other hand, loved to screw players and characters over.  He stole from you, he handed in quests ahead of you to take the credit, he'd slip you poison to weaken you.  He's try to convince everyone to give him and only him ALL THE BUFFS.  He'd lay the blame on you.  And as a team...we killed his character after we booted him from the group.  As a GM it was ""players VS his personal magnificence.  Douche-ass was aptly named.

A sit down is in order outside of a game with all the players.  I don't know if you have played with them all before.  Are they getting lost in their personal character build in the game?  Or are they just asses?  If they are just not team players and very selfish you will need to clean house.  It's sad when it happens but sometimes you just have to disband a group.

Giving them team exercises is a great idea, but I am sad to hear it didn't work out.  If they want PvP then you might not be the DM for them.  If they are just asses, they might not be the players for you.

:/  I wish you the best.  This is a tough situation for anyone to deal with.  It's ok to create some boundaries with your players and it's ok to let them go as well."

Supershinyface,femalefashionadvice,1390508310.0,"No, it's not hard for me to understand that, conceptually, although I've yet to hear a strong case for it applied to cultural appropriation, and in this case I think conflating entitled ignorance with 'valuing personal freedom' is more than a stretch.

Having been provided the information to begin to understand the issues surrounding cultural appropriation regarding Native motifs, and then willfully ignoring it, while whining about the lack of personalized explanation, is not an enlightened cry for freedom. It is the petulant keen of someone unwilling to do the tiniest amount of critical thinking.

Further, to set up a false dichotomy between personal freedom and what others consider to be sacred in this context is disingenuous. First, no one has infringed on the ability of anyone to wear the offensive items listed, the attempt has merely been made to educate on why they are considered offensive. 

Secondly, the idea that *behaving in a respectful manner* infringes on freedom is akin to the idea that wearing clothing at all or standing in a queue does. One may as well throw away all of the shackles of society and live in perfect freedom in a state of nature.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390508320.0,"&gt;I think a lot of people are just intimidated. 

I think that's why the mods really tried hard to do things like today's Thursday thread though, to have easier ways to get involved. I noticed you haven't commented in it yet; but I for one want to know: how are you doing? What's going on in your life right now? Tough day at school? Amazing thing your friend did for you yesterday? Have an argument with your dad? Wondering how people could possibly like this TV show you just started watching? Let us know! I'll be waiting.....

&gt;You seem to be requesting a very high base of knowledge for a user to even earn your ""respect,"" and some people don't have that.

There's a difference between, to remove this from this context, say, respecting my neighbor as a human being, and respecting my neighbor as an American citizen who doesn't vote, serve on juries, exercise his rights, etc. So, in that sense, I respect everyone here as members trying to contribute, but I may not respect them for their point of view or behaviors, if that makes sense.

I respect their right to post, I respect their right to not be attacked for doing so, but I may not respect the content. And just like I have standards, you may have standards too.  This is why I tried to show you that my personal opinions are my personal opinions, but I am not here as a mod to enforce my personal opinions. There'd be a revolution ;) 

And I think it's also important to realize that people, myself included, know very little. More important is learning. Being willing to ask the question. Being willing to consider a new point of view. See a user use a Hebrew word or a Yiddish phrase you don't know? Ask them to define it! ""What's that mean?"" Or google it. I didn't know how the heck to read or make sense of Torah. So I signed up for an adult bat mitzvah class. I'm not saying that I am the end all and be all of knowledge on all things Jewish.

&gt;I guess what I'm saying is that I wish we were nicer to one another.

Agreed. I mean, that's why I agreed to be a mod. I'm here to get people over the hump of participation fear and into the land of committed users. I can stop rude people when I see them - but I can't see everything.  I can argue until I am blue in the face to represent us. But that's only going to get us so far. 

So. I proprosed 4 ideas. What do you think of them? Will any help you personally to be more involved? Will it lower the intimidation factor? Does it interest you? Do you have an idea of your own?"

This makes zero sense. I don't know where you're from, but not only is that impractical in many cases, but not even close to reasonable. In the United States, a police officer can take a life under the same qualifications as a private citizen. Fear for your life or the life of another, a reasonable belief that the person intends to cause death or great bodily harm, and a reasonable belief that a person has the ability to do so.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1390508546.0,"&gt; it makes a great impression when somebody is charismatic and funny and carries himself well, but really, doesn't that all seem a bit superficial?

I think it's normal to like and be attracted to people who are fun to be around and have good social skills. It's a bit superficial, but so is all initial interaction between individuals. If we like the persona a person presents, we want to get to know them on a deeper level. Sometimes that means getting to know some jerks and missing out on awesome people because they are initially awkward turtles in conversation. 

Real confidence is not a superficial trait. Real confidence is being comfortable with who you are as a person. You can be charismatic as fuck and still be very insecure.

The voice is good, though I would caution you to make sure you steer your therapist and MC away from generic character roles.

Small things- If you're going to use the term ""therapist voice"", I think you should describe how that sounds, as well. Also, this line tripped me up: ""Suzanne sighed knowingly. This would be another unproductive session for her."" - It seemed like this was a third person line. If you wanted this to sound like it came from the narrator, you might want to make it more about her than Suzanne.

*""..knowingly as we both realized this would be another unproductive session.""*

Also, it might read better if you change the ""I don't understand why"" paragraph to something more active and in her head: ""This was all so ridiculous. Why was *I* the one who got in trouble—why was *I* the one who ended up in this stupid facility while the bitch who caused this is off the hook?""

I would talk to a real teen counselor, if you could, to see what they generally do if their patient refuses to speak. It seems like she asks a couple questions, then decides it's worthless to keep trying. Counselors tend to (inaccurately) get painted as careless, annoyed people who hate their jobs (and their clients) in YA books, so I would take this chance to show that she at least tried to do her job adequately, or maybe you could show that the therapist was doing a good job, but unreliable narrator Catherine was just trying to paint her as a bad person. Make sense?

Psychological effects (animals not ""feeling"" the same things we do) are a whole *other* ball park.  
  
I have a feeling, within five years of country-wide marijuana legalization, they're going to discover some good use it has on animals (like those with arthritis, or appetite problems). Even if it is just in very very small doses.  
  
This article makes it seem like people are going to kill their animals if they smoke in their own home. Anyone leaving *that much* weed out at disposal... dealer. A very stupid dealer.  "

metssuck,AskReddit,1390508747.0,"I've answered your questions below, but I wanted to correct a premise, since Walt Disney World opened in 1971 there have only been 3 hurricanes that have affected their operations and they were all in the same calendar year (2004, Charlie, Frances and Jeanne).  Charlie is the only one that did real damage anywhere in Central Florida because he was moving so fast that it didn't weaken much at all from a Category 3 that it started at when it came ashore.  Ultimately because Disney is so far inland it's going to take a super large, Katrina or Andrew level, storm hitting it directly on and moving quickly (so coming in straight across the state East or West and not coming up the state vertically)

&gt;What does/would DW do if a major hurricane was headed their way? (Protocols, shut-downs, etc.)

It depends on what's coming, they have only closed Magic Kingdom I think 2 times and the one it ended up being nothing so they were calling all kinds of cast members in trying to get it reopened (including business/IT/Finance, etc...)

&gt;Has DW ever suffered any damage from hurricanes? Minor or major damage, I wanna know.

I'm sure they have, but nothing major and anything they suffered would have been fixed within days

&gt;What would happen if DW suffered major damage from a natural disaster, like a ride being destroyed/flooded?

They would work as fast as possible to repair it, but ultimately if it was just one ride they would close it and put it in for ""refurbishment"" like they do when they are enhancing the rides 

&gt;What is the likelihood of major damage? I assume DW is very strongly built, but I don't know for a fact. In other words, how likely is it that DW is strong enough to withstand a major hurricane that could destroy an average house?

Major damage is very unlikely just because of how far in coast they are, plus they have all kinds of plans to reinforce things as needed.

&gt;What would happen if a hurricane majorly damaged DW? I'm talking like half the park being destroyed. How long would they shutdown? What if the whole park got wiped out somehow? Would they even bother rebuilding it?

This is entirely hypothetical, but they would rebuild anything damaged, if an entire park had to be shut down for a while they would minimize that as much as possible.  

&gt;How long do you think Disney World will be around? It's been going strong for 50 years, but what do you think it'll be like in 2050? 2100? I'm very curious what people think about the legacy of DW.

It's not going anywhere anytime soon.  They keep hitting records every year and they are in great shape.  I would be shocked to hear it go away in my lifetime."

A man being the head of the household doesn't necessarily mean he does/gets whatever he wants from his wife/while in his household, to her detriment. Being in charge of every major family decision, and choosing to bear the responsibility of those decisions, good or bad, sounds like the kind of burden I would never want, nor wish on my own husband. It's the way a lot of men have been raised to handle things, though. And there are still plenty of women that appreciate this dynamic. And it works, for some.

sunofabeeeyetch,bestof,1390508797.0,"You're perfectly fine having emotions. It is not, however, justifiable to act on those emotions in a way that would bring severe distress to the person targeted, and with the full knowledge that it will. It is further unjustifiable to continue acting on those emotions when the afflicted person(s) has stated their wish to not be bothered. Although emotions are a vital part of retaining humanity, it is also vital that we control the resulting actions enough so as not to infringe upon another person's personal space, boundaries, etc.

Furthermore, the idea that ""nobody owes her 'just friendship'"" is a frankly absurd one, in that she is likely an intelligent, rational human being just like anyone else, and as such deserves consideration of her desires and interests within the sphere of interpersonal communication. Unless her personality is utterly horrendous and she is a petty, manipulative caricature of a person, she is very much allowed to desire and seek out platonic friendships. To say otherwise is a catalyst to justifying rather unpleasant behaviors. 

In addition, to call her ""entitled"" is a gross misunderstanding of social standards. She is not acting entitled if she wishes to have platonic friendships, as those are a strong and standard part of human society regardless of gender; she deserves to have relationships that do not feature the abject manipulation of her being, and to state that she should expect every interaction she has as containing those features is frankly disturbing. Perhaps you would agree with the CEO of Nestle that access to potable water is not a human right? 

The term ""entitled"" refers more to the unjust desires and expectations of an overprivileged being; people complaining about the friendzone, for example, are oftentimes entitled because they are not necessarily deserving of a romantic relationship at that point in their life. Their demeanor and general treatment of people is based mainly on their narcissistic behavior and expectations, a poor understanding of human interaction, or both; they often fail the stipulations and prerequisites of romantic relationships in many ways, and as such are not deserving of one. This is much different from the person described in OP's post, who by all interpretations appears to be a regular person without overtly petty or sadistic tendencies.

I suppose the biggest concern is that you believe desires trump rights, and more so that the right to stable, extra-familial relationships without any sexual/romantic expectations or undertones is overridden by the carnal cravings of another person. Even if a person were to ""fall in love"" with her, so to speak, any further interaction after being denied a romantic relationship should be strictly platonic. Is that so difficult?"

However, I'm late 20s and the amount of people I know who read books (off all ages) is very small. I think of all the people I can talk to about books in my life and it's about 10 people tops out of hundreds. 

I think it's fair to say a lot of people don't read books. But then I think there is also a large portion of people who read books but don't really read them. Of the 10 people I can talk to about books only half of them can have a deeper discussion of the book putting aside the normal plot and characters. 

I think a lot of people get a book or check one out from the library only to skim through it or not make it all the way through. I also think there's a lot of people who read Kindle Singles, or borrow the new hot popular book from their friend and read it and that's their only book they'll read that year. 

For a lot of people a book is a lengthy time commitment with a possible deep reward. I think people tend to read smaller things (magazines, news articles, internet articles, forums) because the time commitment is very small but the reward of reading is nearly instant. However, books are awesome and people need to read more. Books may be large time commitments to people nowadays but they're so worth it. I've gained so much knowledge and insight on the world from books. I've had some of the funnest times of my life reading.

kakersdozen,OSU,1390508810.0,"Your graduating in 4 years or less really depends on the major you choose. I used to be a student advisor for my department during the semester switch, so I know the new ""bingo sheet"" pretty well. In freshman year, they had the kids taking calc, physics, chemistry, and intro to engineering courses all at the same time. You would kill yourself if you did this for longer than a semester, and even then, you might not make it through a single semester. However, we *needed* to have a 4 year plan, so that's what it was. The work load for these courses would be incredibly strenuous, especially for a freshman with little to no experience at the college level. 4.5 years, maybe 5 is much more reasonable.

No.  Offense isn't some kind of unstoppable biological process.  People *decide* how to react to things.  If someone gets offended, it's because they have decided to react that way.  On top of that, nothing *happens* when you get offended except what you decide to do as a result.  You do not have the right to not be offended.  "

The second term really bothers her because she sometimes has issues with eating/body image (although her current weight is not due to restricted eating). 

I know for her its really hard since while she gets very hurt by people pointing out her low weight, she has a lot of ""fat/chubby"" moments where when she looks at herself she feels like she is a bit too big. I always try my best to reassure her *that* is certainly not the case, while at the same time not implying she is *too* skinny either.

HellMuttz,gaming,1390509212.0,"Yes, A lot of computer repair shops will do all the work for you. 

when people say to spend *extra* money on different component, its their personal opinion gained from their own experience. Building computers if very much a learning process, so even though you obviously can't spend the extra on everything, when people start offering advice the best you can do it learn from it. 

That being said, I didnt explain *why* the case is the one component I would spend the extra on, so here goes:

The Case is the part that I feel is most commonly over looked by new builders. the importance of design aspects and features are very easy to over look when you have never had to experience putting a computer together. 

From my experience the ""Extra"" you have to spend that separates a case that will get you by and one you will really love is around $20 - $30. which is less than the ""extra"" you would have to spend on a graphics card or motherboard ect.

Lastly, of all the components in your build the case has the longest longevity. If you buy a good case now, you can use it for more builds down the road if you want. 

If you ever decide to build your own computer, feel free to PM me any questions you have.  

Edit: I was on my way out the door when posting so I forgot to add: a good quality, well designed case will make your first build (any build really) a much smoother and enjoyable experience."

reginaidiotarum,TumblrInAction,1390509228.0,"I kind of agree with this person's view of feminism. From what I've seen, the most neutral and hard to fight definition of ""Feminism"" is ""working to empower women.""

I don't agree with the dictionary or wikipedia's definition because not all feminists agree that ""equality"" is the end game, and there is a fair portion of literature that is clearly not about equality, most notable is the SCUM Manifesto. I find it odd that wikipedia mentions that feminism is about equality between genders, and calls this ""a radical feminist manifesto."" Clearly any misandry would indicate that the feminist in question may not be a feminist.

A feminist is a person working to empower women. An anti-feminist is someone that feels that women are equal now, and any more push for women empowerment would lead to them having more privilege then men. Someone who is not a feminist may not agree with the anti-feminists, but may not feel they need to dedicate their resources to the feminist cause.

If this was the definition accepted by everyone, I would have to call myself a feminist. I like to actively work for the betterment of women. I also find flaws in how society treats boys, and feel they could be empowered in their decision-making by a lot. I do not feel that Privilege is actually measurable in any way, nor do I find it useful in any sort of discourse, especially in the ad hominum way it's been used. I find no grounds for ""The Patriarchy,"" I have found no solutions to this imaginary problem being provided, and I would like people to go back to focusing on finding real problems and working toward real solutions."

I actually don't find it creepy that you went through my post history, because you did it for a legitimate reason.  Not to find out where I live so you can come stalk me.  Creepiness is all about boundaries.

&gt; I didn't have an agenda writing this

I find this odd, since most satire has an agenda.  Swift wanted to call attention to poverty and the starving.  Austen wanted to mock the social traditions of her time.  Satire almost demands an agenda.  And yes, Swift writes a ridiculous essay.  But he does so with a serious tone.

&gt;I can see why a redpiller might latch on to it

Satire, unfortunately, is always going to fly over the heads of some people.

&gt;the whole of the story is not finished but it is certainly not intended as a statement against feminism, more a jab at radical liberalism  

I think you can make a really good satire out of this actually.  Looking at the introduction to your story again, I can see that the elements are there (estrogen injections, CISlums, etc), but they're not yet on the level they need to be.  Ask yourself some questions about this society.  Are the estrogen injections mandatory, or is there a fee for opting out (I'm thinking like when the Arabs conquered other groups during the expanse of the muslim empire, they didn't force anyone to convert to Islam, but there was a tax if you were a different religion)?  If there are CIS slums, does that mean that being transgendered is the norm?  Because if so, that's a whole other host of questions.

The main thing that make me think you don't understand patriarchy actually, was the idea it was the norm, in a supposedly post-patriarchal society, for women to wear veils to avoid male gazes.  That idea is a construct of patriarchy and I don't understand how it would grow out of the kind of society you describe.  Veiling women says that they are sex objects and that men would be driven to horrible acts of lust by seeing them, two ideas that would be abandoned in such a society.

The best way to satirize is to take something to its extreme.  Want to satirize radical liberalism?  Well, maybe everyone has to be naked all the time, because no one should be ashamed of their bodies.  Maybe no one is allowed to get married because marriage is a patriarchal construct.  Maybe everyone is expected to just have sex with a bunch of people and take drugs to feel good all the time, like in Brave New World.

I think your ideas are there, you just don't have the execution quite down yet.

To answer your question, I've only read the first few pages.  I want to read more (I'm also doing line comments and that's slow), but I wanted to have a better idea first of who you are and what it is you're going for.

Anyway, I hope this helped!  I didn't find much of it funny yet, but I think it can get there."

I have friends who always make comments to me about how I go out all the time, how I'm a very active and social person.  This is actually not the case...I'm a huge homebody.  I go out maybe once a week, maybe once every two weeks.  But any time I DO go out, I put a photo of what I did on Facebook....be it some delicious food I had or something random.  So...to me, I know I only go out a few times a month.  I'm really stingy and don't like spending money outside.

But because I would post anytime I do go out, that's all people see of my life.  They don't see me rushing home and lazying around on the bed 6 days out of the week, they only see the fun I have. And it's changed their opinion of me to one that is not true.

grammarpanda,CysticFibrosis,1390509341.0,"It can be so frustrating to see money be a more significant roadblock in someone's health than their strength or will to fight.  My partner and I have lost insurance a couple of times, and it's a terrible feeling, watching our stockpile of meds (which we hoard like squirrels now, having faced this before) dwindle as the weeks go by.

We were once in a similar position - hadn't been to clinic in over a year, had no insurance to pay for a trip, were trying to figure out how to pay for meds and which ones to try to pay for first.  I work for a hospital and finally went to one of the doctors I work for and laid out our situation.  He called the hospital's adult CF clinic and put me in touch with their social worker who told me to bring my partner in for an appointment right away, that they would hold the billing issue for clinic treatment while she looked into assistance programs and, eventually, got us through the bureaucracy.  We got a ton of help from our clinic social worker and from the national CF Legal line.  Can you call a local clinic and see if their SW has any ideas you haven't heard of yet?

On a different note, with regard to money and debt - it might be helpful for you to know that any debt you leave behind will not pass, legally, to your family.  Collections will get what they can out of whatever 'estate' you leave behind, and they are notorious for calling family members of the deceased, but in the US there is a law (I believe it's called the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act - here's an article outlining how it works in this sort of situation: http://money.msn.com/credit-cards/who-pays-off-credit-card-debt-after-a-death ) preventing any debt from actually belonging to them so long as they didn't co-sign any loans or have their name on your bank accounts.  They should not be bullied or coerced into payment - creditors can be unscrupulous, but if they stand their ground and use specific language surrounding the law, the calls should cease.

All the best to you - your situation is one I'm somewhat familiar with.  I'm so grateful now to live in a state that provides free insurance to those with genetic conditions.

Laozen,science,1390509341.0,"If it has exactly the same properties as H2O then it would be... H2O.

Water's very important for a number of reasons, and there's a very good reason why water out of all chemicals is so critical when it comes to chemistry and by extension biology.  Few chemicals operate like water; it's a universal solvent, it's produced by acid-base reactions, and Hydrogen and Oxygen are relatively abundant throughout the universe because they have such low atomic numbers, Hydrogen especially, but Oxygen can be made fffairly easily by fusion within stars.

Water also has a number of other properties which make it a unique chemical.  I'm afraid I have to head out pretty soon so I don't really have time to get into all of them, but suffice it to say that water is uniquely conducive to life and you would be hard-pressed to find a chemical substance that behaves like water, especially as you go into organic chemistry, which in turn leads into biochemistry.  You need more than just water for life to exist but it would be very unlikely that life as we currently understand it could arise without it, or at the very least it's a good indicator that there are the basics for creating life that may be available in an area.

So basically there is no compound with exactly the same properties as H2O, nor are there chemical substances which act very similar to it that would be in such relative abundance.  The answer is no.

sweaty_obesity,AskReddit,1390509420.0,"Little late to the party but, here's a list:

1) Put hot sauce on fig newtons

2) Have a towel on his chair specifically to combat his massive sweating 

3) hide breakfast burritos in everyone's office

4) Randomly dial people from the break room phone and then fart into the reciever.

5) Put his suppository in the break room freezer to ""keep it cool, so it goes in smooth""

6) Go to Taco Bell every day at 10 am and come back with 4 burritos and then put 6-8 packets of fire sauce on them. 

7) Had to have a cop come in and listen to the threatening voicemails a fuck-buddy would leave him on his work phone at 3 am every Thursday.

8) Shit himself at work multiple times. 

9) Fart on other coworkers and shit himself while he did it. 

There are many more. Let me know if you want to hear them.

Edit: since you guys seemed interested, here's a few more. I really wish I were making these up.

10) dated a girl who keyed his chest when he broke up with her

11) Same girl who keyed his chest showed up at his apartment's pool and started screaming at him that he was screwing all the girls there (he was just sitting with his dog) and drove off in a hurry when someone called the cops. She came back and promptly t-boned a parked cop car while she was drunk as hell.

12) Has sex in the parking lot during lunch and put his used condom on the door handle of one of our coworkers car

13) had to leave the water running and wipe himself down when he would take a shit because he would sweat so bad.

14) would actively hold conversations with people while he was shitting/grunting/whatever in the bathroom. Would also roll up paper towels, wet them and throw them from behind the ""safety"" of the handicap stall while shitting. 

15) while we working one sunday, he took the mouse of the onyl girl in the department (who no one liked) and jammed it in his ass crack and then put it back. We were all rendered speech less. 

16) Brought a girl to the office christmas party. Disappeared for about an hour in the middle of the party because he was having sex with some other chick in the hotel bathroom 1 floor up.

17) had another girl attack him with a 2-liter at his apartment. When he opened the door she chucked it at his head. He ducked and his dog hauled ass out the front door. He chased the dog and she stole his sheets while screaming ""see if you can fuck some skank without your sheets"".

From what I've read, however, most of the guys are simply looking for the ""cool girl"" who fulfills their fantasies instead of valuing her for her person. There is little mention about romantic potential in the first place, and her experiences suggest that almost nobody values her for her abilities or input; their eyes rest on her as a woman and what that can offer to them.

It's like an inverse isolation, in the sense that she is surrounded by fake people who are either attempting to be manipulative or are upfront but won't take rejection. I imagine she's quite lonely as a result, because she -- with good reason -- cannot trust people to get to know her beyond the status of ""woman"" and ""shared interests."" If she isn't looking for a relationship and simply wants friends, we shouldn't fault her for that. "
fortuna_spins_you,AskMen,1390509530.0,"&gt; Many girls get this often enough to be disgusted with it.

It is just an unwanted advance. A lot of it is context. A lot of it is feeling your worth is tied up in your looks. Some of it is feeling objectified. Like I keep repeating, not every woman has men falling all over themselves to be with them. Sure, there are women who do, but I don't know that it is most.

&gt; the average guy can count on one hand the number of times that a girl who he wasn't related to complimented his appearance or told him that he looks attractive, or was approached/asked out by a girl.

I also think a lot of approaching (or lack of approaching) has to do with maturity. As adults get older, flirting games just aren't in the equation anymore. It also upsets me that women don't feel they can be assertive and approach men without negative cultural connotations. I know men get the short end of the stick when it comes to making the first move. My point generally is, there is more to dating than the first move.

If I have learned anything from AskMen, it is that guys aren't complimented enough and they should be. I think that's sad that men aren't told they are great or handsome or smart or fun. A lot of you are and you never get to hear it."

I used to agree with this and then I realized my self esteem was really shitty and I shouldn't think badly of skinny people just because I'm not. My point is first recognize that some people say this stuff because they are ashamed of themselves. 
However, some people might just not understand that you are healthy.  They might say things out of concern for you because they don't believe that you are not trying to be that way.  If you care about what they think then the only thing you can do is try to explain.
That said, if people are being downright mean, then I agree snappy comments are usually best.  Sometimes it is not good to let it roll of your back, you have to let people know where your line is.

Edit: more thoughts, dont be ashamed of how you look though and definitely try to accept the heartfelt compliments.  Maybe you need to start a positive mantra to remind yourself you look great and can be happy with who and what you are."

I rarely hear guys phrase it that way either, but a lot of them do tend to say that want someone who isn't jealous (omg you talked to another girl at the store!!!), clingy (you still want to be with me, right? why do you want to go someplace without me?!?!), or really insecure (am I fat?

The saving grace- I tried to convince myself- was that he promised to never spread that feeling to future children. He said he wouldn't tell them gay is wrong, but he also wasn't willing to tell them it's okay to be gay early on.

In the end, this was definitely one of the many reasons I ended things. You just have to decide how much of a deal breaker it is for you. Will he spread the hate to his kids? Can you just agree to never, ever talk about it?"

It might be in Lakeview, but the majority of patients I have taken care of there have been disabled / low income / chronic psych people living in uptown...exactly the demographic that hospitals make the least amount of money on. So Thorek doesn't really have the resources to expand or remodel like some of the chain hospitals or the multi-specialty medical district hospitals have. So it just sits there in Lakeview as a sort of functional relic of the days prior to gentrification.

viewless25,nyjets,1390510342.0,"I'm a huge Clemson fan and I'm honestly torn on this. Tajh is more athletic than people give him credit for. He lead Clemson in rushing in the Orange Bowl and Chick-fil-a bowl (see his 75 yd. TD run on the opening drive). In his passing game, all he knows how to do is break passing record after passing record.  Tajh brought up a very valid point that the one thing his overperforming receivers have in common is that they all were successful from him under center.  Sammy and Martavis's numbers were much lower with Cole Stoudt and Chad ""Swag"" Kelly (Clem's backups who both received a fair level of playtime). He's put up big numbers against Georgia, LSU, and Ohio State. However, he has some kinks in him. I'm sure we're all sick of quarterbacks with turnover issues, and Tajh has *sometimes* had issues with that. He gave up multiple picks and fumbles in his games against Florida State and South Carolina. He *does* have some struggles with reading the defensive secondary. And he's shown that he doesn't do a great job escaping the defensive linemen. His turnovers often come at the least opportune time i.e. on the 5 yard-line in the Orange Bowl, on the closing drive of the Orange Bowl, on the opening drives of the Carolina and FSU games, etc.  I hope that as he matures, he can work out these kinks. Especially if he's going to go from one team I love to another. If we drop Sanchez, I'd argue in favor of taking him after round 4 if available. He's not perfect, but he's one of the best quarterbacks in a historic football program, he holds a number of records in the ACC and Clemson, and as of late, shows up to big games (see: Chick-fil-a bowl 2013 where he had a clutch GW drive, Georgia @ Clemson 2013 where he put the team on his back, and the Orange Bowl earlier this month where he won a shoot-out with the Ohio State offense).

ashwinmudigonda,writing,1390510346.0,"Well, most of this is obviously subjective. But I found it quite helpful for both of us to talk. 

For example: Last night, I finished reading his book, and I thought that the last three chapters were hollow and just faded away from a very powerful start and mid section. He said that that was how he intended, and that after the climax, one has to fade away. I told him that three chapters is a lot to fade for, and to showcase what I meant, I counted the word ""father"" in every chapter (his book explores a father-son relationship), plotted it on a graph and sent the graph over. I said, ""See! After a spike at Ch. 9, it drifts and fades away until 15."" And he replied with ""OMG! I get it now."" He sent me a rewrite of a few chapters after that. 

As a (non-jealous) friend, I took it up on me to see that he gets the best of out of his book. And I hope he does the same with me. It's normal for two writers not to 100% agree with each other. For my book, the first thing he said was ""Lose the Prologue, dude. No one likes it any more."" I didn't really agree with that, but he sent me [this article](http://www.writersdigest.com/writing-articles/by-writing-goal/write-first-chapter-get-started/4-story-structures-that-dominate-novels) without saying much and I had my own epiphany - my zombie book is an event based story, and it would read better without a prologue.

codayus,AskMen,1390510459.0,"I do, yes.

As for why...  Well...

Theoretical/academic answer:  Human civilization is built on specialisation and trade.  We pick a single task, we get exceptionally good at it, and we then use the market to exchange the results of that task with others.  Everything we have that sets us apart from a neolithic hunter-gatherer is a result of this process:  Our clothes, our food, our houses, our gadgets, even our educations, haircuts, and healthcare.  But unless you want to try hire someone to cook *every* meal for you, to do your laundry, to clean your bathroom, to make your bed, to look after your children...not every task can or should be sourced from the market.  Some non-market tasks are still required to live.  And yet:  The logic of specialization and trade is inescapable.  If you are in a committed two person relationship, if one of you specialises in tasks such as cooking dinner, you will end up with better dinners cooked in less total time.  And in fact it usually makes sense if one partner focuses on market work, possibly to the exclusion of non-market work, while the other partner focuses on all the non-market tasks we need to live, with possibly some part-time market work tacked on if desired.  The result will be more money earned from market work, more non-market tasks performed, and more leisure time, than if you had tried to share market and non-market work equally between the couple.

Theoretical/practical answer:  If one person focuses on their job, and the other person focuses on housework, children, ec., you'll end up with the first person earning much more than they otherwise would, and the housework being done much better and more efficiently.  And studies have shown (by Elizabeth Warren first and foremost, google her book ""The Two-Income Trap"") that you often come out ahead with the specialization option.  If the lower paid partner works instead of staying home, and then you use their income to buy services on the market (day care, prepared meals, laundry), once you factor in transport and taxes, you generally are worse off.  People talk about how that'd be ""nice if they could afford it""; but that's lunacy.  What you can afford is a function, yes, of your income, but also of your expenses.  If you eat out every night, you probably can't afford to have one half of the couple stay home, no.  On the other hand, if you're eating healthy, home-cooked meals every night, you probably don't have the time for both halves of the couple to engage in market work full time.  You can't have your cake and eat it too; you're swapping a whole package of goods and services purchased from the market for ones produced via non-market production (ie, prepared meals for home-cooked meals; day-care for mom looking after them).  If you think this represents a decrease in your overall consumption levels (because, eg, you would rather eat out than eat a home-cooked meal) this is a bad trade; if you don't, it doesn't.  But you can't do the stay-at-home mom thing *and* continue to consume all the market goods and services you would have consumed as a DINK couple.  Just like you can't have your partner go back to work, but still expect them to do all the non-market work they were doing previously.

Empiric answer:  My mother was a stay-at-home mom, and I think she did a great job.  In some ways, it's the one part of my parent's relationship I really admire and want to replicate.  The key is to recognize that both market and non-market work is necessary to the sucess of the partnership.  If either partner ever finds themselves thinking something like ""well, I/they make the money, so I/they should make the decision..."" you're absolutely doomed.  It's an equal partnership or nothing.

&gt; My future career really motivates me, but I'd also one day like to be a full time mom for a number of years until my hypothetical kids are old enough to do certain things on their own.

Keep in mind that the job market rewards productivity first, foremost, and only.  And productivity is highly correlated with the amount of time you can devote to the job.  And *that* means that, as a practical matter, nobody ever rises to the top of even a slightly competitive career field if they take time off.  I'm not sure you can really have a ""career"", as such, and also take off a few years to be a ""full time mom"".

To come back to the example of my mom, she was a highly-paid VP at a major bank, working in what's now called IT, with a lot of staff reporting to her.  But after she quit, had me, and raised me for several years, all those doors were closed to her.  It's not sexism; a man who quit his job for a few years to, eg, go sailing would face the same difficulties.  Tough jobs demand stupid levels of dedication, focus, 60 hour work weeks, and devoting yourself to the job consistently for years on end.  She could have ""gone back to work"", if she had chosen, but she could never have resumed her career.

I think your plan of being a social worker is great.  I think your plan of being a full time mom is great.  I think it will work out well for you if you keep your options open, go down the road, and see which plan ends up working out for you.  I fear you may be disappointed if you are trying to follow *both* plans."

I don't know much about this rendering engine either, I'm just arguing that it would be unfeasible (and unnecessary) to do what you're suggesting. The detail with which you would have to simulate natural processes (climate, physics, biology) to achieve realistic-looking landscapes would be incredible. 

Also, there isn't as much variation in within biomes IRL as you seem to think.

sunofabeeeyetch,bestof,1390510583.0,"Your assertions that my position would switch with genders is absurd and without any evidence. I've been on both sides of the situation before, and derive some of my ideas on this topic from my experiences.

You also miss a critical point in that she doesn't want that kind of attention, yet people keep giving it to her. The direct violation of her strongly-held desires does not make for a justifiable action. One would imagine that a person who has likely pointed out that they wish not to currently be involved in romantic or sexual relationships is deserving of that consideration.

Also, I suppose I should point out the obvious: the core of the problem resides in her being unable to partake in her own interests without being pestered by other people. This is because she is a woman, and as such is seen as her gender before her individual person. She is not going to single bars and complaining about her experiences there; to do so would be rather unwarranted. The case, however, is that these ""suitors"" do not value her as a person, and only really see her as the key to fulfilling their fantasies. They become friends with her with the ulterior endgoal of starting a romantic relationship, which is highly manipulative and quite frankly contemptible. The case provided did not say anything about suitors who are upfront about their desires from the beginning and respectful of her desires in the end, and is indeed discussing those manipulative people I have just outlined.

When her expectations are betrayed at every turn, you can't blame her for being cynical. She does not deserve to be friendless (only the utterly horrendous do), but owing to her circumstances it appears to be the case.

Given that you believe water is not a human right, however, I do not think we can come to a constructive agreement or conclusion. That attitude suggests a callous outlook on human rights, and as such our viewpoints likely differ too greatly to come to any conclusion. Besides, you come to rather absurd conclusions about my attitudes on gender, and I can't reasonably expect to debate someone who makes leaps and jumps to such extents."

RichardBehiel,spacex,1390510665.0,"I think that many people would agree with you on that.  From an economic standpoint, if it costs a finite amount to build and maintain a space elevator, and the daily cost of humanity's launches is increasing, then at a certain point the space elevator might become the cheaper option (assuming that it's extremely efficient and all that).

The problem that I have with the space elevator is that it's just too big.  Materials become relatively weaker as you scale up, because their mass (weight) increases as a cube and their cross-section (strength) only increases as a square.  So not only are large buildings subject to much greater forces than small buildings, but they are also subject to much greater *stresses*.  That's a problem, since any given material only has a certain amount of stress that it can withstand before it breaks, and as a result we don't live in 10-km tall buildings.  

In the case of a space elevator, the most popular idea is to have it hold itself up in tension by putting a counterweight up in space such that the center of mass of the system is way out *past GEO* which is 35,786 km above the surface of the earth.  

For scale, the Burj Khalifa only reaches .83 km above the surface of the earth.  So the space elevator would have to be over 43,000 times the height of the tallest building in the world... that's ridiculous.  To be fair though, skyscrapers are built to withstand compression whereas a space elevator would have to withstand tension, so that 43,000 figure is pretty meaningless other than to provide a sense of scale.

If you're mathematically inclined, find a material with a huge density/strength ratio, and calculate the cross section that a space elevator would need to have in order to hold itself up (assume that the center of mass is right at GEO for simplicity).  I'd do it right now but I'm running out of time (might return later to elaborate if anyone cares).

If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were. Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee."" -John Donne

injoy,Christianity,1390510869.0,"Whew, okay, to be really honest with you, I quoted the Romans verses first because I thought they provided a pretty clear answer to your initial question: essentially, to display God's wrath and to display His mercy by saving a ""remnant,"" i.e. a smaller portion.  And your initial question implied honest curiosity, not the beginning of an argument, but you responded to the verses I posted in a fairly politely antagonistic way, which I just wasn't expecting.  I am not part of the AMA and I'm in the middle of a horribly busy afternoon and was reading Reddit on a break.  But when you wrote back argumentatively, I found myself in the middle of a discussion when my intention had been to post the verse and leave it at that as an answer.  Soooo, at that point I did not have a lot of time and I certainly didn't answer very *fully*, and maybe it would have been wiser not to answer at all.  I am sorry for giving you the wrong impression.  I am still very short on time so, I will try to be gracious but please forgive I can't answer every point. :)

What I was trying to say is your idea that it would somehow be ""better"" for God to have mercy on a lot of people rather than be just on a lot of people is a human argument.  You will not find it in scripture.  What you will find, what I posted in my first post, is that God is wrathful and just.  That is why my argument about the judge is not earthly; it IS what Romans says, and I just thought you might see the benefits of justice in a human context.  But the idea of justice is biblical, and it was to that that I was appealing.  I can see how it was confusing though and it was a bad example.

However, here is the problem: you apparently think murder is worse than rebelling against God.  Or ignoring God.  Or worshipping Him incorrectly.  That doesn't jive with the Bible at all.  ""There is none righteous, no not one"" -- even the most ""upstanding"" human being in the world is not righteous.  There is none who **do good** (Rom 3); ""But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind,"" Isaiah 64.  We are completely and utterly guilty.  Not a trace of good.  It is this rebellion that I mean is worse than ""only"" murder; we dare to not be perfect in the face of an infinitely perfect God.

Your argument about Satan winning is answered in Scripture and in the character of God.  I don't really understand what you are trying to argue.  This is what the Word of God says.  And one day every knee will bow and every tongue confess, and everyone will see Who indeed has won the victory.

As far as universalism, you are right that you didn't use that word.  But I don't understand the point or argumentativeness of your questions if that is not the underlying question lurking beneath the surface.  You are asking how it is not true that Christ died for all, and why it isn't better if Christ died for all--or even most.  Isn't that universalism?

&gt;how Christ's victory was more effective than the consequences of sin

I honestly don't understand what you are asking here."

&gt; it would be a lot easier to debunk the idea that gender is a social construct

It would be a lot easier for people to argue if this misunderstanding between the two sides was laid to waste, because it leads to pointless moronic arguments from both sides.

You're arguing against the wrong thing. What you intend on saying is that *""sex is not a social construct""*. Don't make this about ""gender"" because that has ambiguous meaning.

Firstly, the term has long been appropriated for feminist political purposes, and secondly the concept has even been used in the past in ways that have little to do with biology.

An example would be in foreign languages where it's more obvious. In the Romance languages like French, different nouns can feminine and masculine forms (""il"", ""elle"", ""ils"", ""elles""... ""an automobile""/""une automobile"" is feminine despite being a nonliving object). It has little to do with biology and more to do with culture and overall social perception of those objects (curvature, purpose, etc). 

This is true even in other cultures throughout history that use feminine vs masculine pronouns and forms (in the case of pictographical writing systems like East Asian ones) to describe inanimate objects, concepts, and roles/positions within society. E.g., in Chinese, ""good"" (a concept, not a living thing) is written partially with the ""girl"" character.

In such a context, that concept of ""gender"" is in fact a social construct.

Modern day usage of the term ""gender"" has become imprecise. If you're going to argue about biology, genetics, all that other crap, just use ""sex"". That has a much clearer meaning."

andjok,changemyview,1390510931.0,"It is not racist to observe that a lot of individual black people you interact with have poor character. It is racist to assume that every black person you meet will be like that.

Now if we weren't talking about people, it would be perfectly logical and reasonable to make generalizations like that. If you find that most of a certain type of food tastes awful, you are right to avoid it and assume that it will always taste bad. But with people, it is unfair to the individual to treat them differently or pre judge them based on race. Race does not affect character, and if you meet a black person of good character but treat him poorly simply because he is black, then that is unfair to him no matter how many black people have poor character. 

Obviously, with the way humans usually reason it can be hard not to be racist if you see lots of people with poor character of a certain race and make that connection. But in order to treat individuals fairly we have to try to look past that."

jareths_tight_pants,AskMen,1390511150.0,"They can cause migraines. I'm not sure why. I was on one pill (Desogen, IIRC) that I had been on for 3 or 4 years and was doing fine, then the GYN accidentally wrote the refill script for the higher dose and I didn't notice the switch. I was on that for 4 months I think because CVS's generics supplier switched at the exact same time so the packaging was already different. I had migraines almost daily. At least 3-4 a week. Full on migraines with auditory and visual auras, nausea, altered sense of taste, etc... 

Finally I went to my GP who noticed the change, switched me back to my usual lower dose, and started me on a low dose of Topiramate that she was titrating up slowly every month. I did that for about 6 months and when the migraines still wouldn't go away she sent me to a neurologist. The neurologist worked with my GYN to change me to a super low dose BCP (ortho-tri-cyclen lo) and bumped up the topiramate more aggressively. The new BCP was great, but very expensive. I switched to the regular dose generic and tried it for 4 months and it was just absolutely awful. My menstrual cramps were back, the food cravings made me gain 10 pounds over 4 months, and the mood swings were just driving me and my husband insane. My migraines were down to once or twice a week and were less intense.

Then my hair started to fall out.

Apparantly it's a well documented but not well known fact that birth control pills and topiramate can cause hair loss. I ended up losing almost half of my hair in a diffuse pattern that started over the left temple, spread across to the right, then worked backwards to ear level. After 1 month of the neurologist and GYN assuring me it wasn't the meds causing this I decided to say fuck them and weaned off the topiramate and stopped the BCP.

I went to a derm who said it was AGA that had most likely been aggravated by the hormones. Apparantely when I hit menopause it will start to fall out again from the hormonal shift. But now, a year after it started falling out, it's almost back to normal. The really funny thing is that I regrew it in the opposite pattern that it fell out (back to front and right to left).

So.... I don't use the pill anymore. And after a touchy 1st month off of it (mild cramps, hot flashes, cravings, heavier periods) my body has regulated itself and things are going well.

After going through all of that horror if a guy said to me ""I won't date you unless you're on the pill or have an implant put into your body"" I'd tell him to go fuck off. Yes, having the intimacy of condom-free sex is great and yes it does feel a little better (according to my husband) but you don't get to dictate what goes into my body. Especially not for the sake of your orgasm.

FrusTrick,sweden,1390511155.0,"&gt;3. CARL BILDT, AIDE TO MODERATE PARTY LEADERGOSTA BOYMAN, CONFIDED TO POLITICAL COUNSELOR ANDEUR/NE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOODS THAT TENTATIVEAGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED ON THE NUCLEAR ENERGYISSUE, AND THAT DISCUSSION HAS TURNED TOSPECIFICS OF THE NEW GOVERNMENT. BILDT SAID HEUNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER COMPROMISE SOLUTION REACHEDBY THE THREE LEADERS, TWO NEW NUCLEAR PLANTS(BARSEBACK II AND RINGHALS III) WOULD NOT BECHARGED AT LEAST UNTIL 1978, DESPITE THE FACT THATBARSEBACK II IS SCHEDULED TO BE LEADED THIS MONTH.NO NEW PLANTS WOULD BE CONSTRUCTED. IN ADDITION, A ROYAL COMMISSION WOULD BE APPOINTED TO STUDY ALLASPECTS OF NUCLEAR SAFEGUARDS AND WOULD BE CHARGEDTO REPORT IN TIME FOR THE 1978 MAJOR DEBATE IN THERIKSDAG ON ENERGY POLICY. BILDT ADDED THAT THECOALITION WOULD NOT BE ADVERSE TO HOLDING APUBLICREFERENDUM ON THE ENTIRE QUESTION OF THE FUTUREOF NUCLEAR POWER IN SWEDEN AFTER THE INVESTIGATIVECOMMISION SUBMITS ITS REPORT.

4. BILDT ALSO STATED THERE WILL IN FACT BE ATHREE-PARTY GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH ALLOCATION OFPOSITIONS AND PERCENTAGE OF REPRESENTATION WASSTILL UNDER DISCUSSION. HE STATED THAT NEWGOVERNMENT HAS EVERY CHANCE OF REMAING IN POWERAT LEAST UNTIL 1982 IF THE SOLUTION TO THE NUCLEARPROBLEM CAN BE RECONCILED WITH THE DIFFERINGPERSPECTIVES OF THE COALITION PARTNERS, WHICH HEBELIEVES IS LIKELY IF THE COMPROMISE PLAN IS IMPLEMENTED.


Detta kommer från en rapport som bevisar att Bildt läckte ut information till dåvarande Amerikanska utrikesministern Henry Kissinger om information över kärnkraftsfrågan i Sverige. Alla dessa dokument var enligt Per Ahlmark (FP) och Thorbjörn Fälldin hemliga även för partierna, något som Bildt visste. 
Trots detta så tyckte Carl Bildt att det var passande att ge denna hemliga information till främmande makt.

jlawl,NoStupidQuestions,1390511301.0,"There are a lot of strains of E. coli. You will likely inhale some on a day to day, and yeah you'd likely breath them in from smelling a fart. They obviously won't get you sick a majority of the time however.

the nasty strains of E. coli, like O157:H7, can lead to some nasty sicknesses, namely bloody diarrhea and renal failure. I mean if you encountered someone with that, and you let them fart in your mouth, I suppose there is a possibility of getting it that way. The problem is unless it's specifically linked to a food you ate or an exposure you had, there isn't really a way to tell how you got a particular strain of E. coli.

Other strains are bad too, E. coli is the most common source of urinary tract infections in women, but that has more to do with how close the vaginal is to the rectum, and there is some bad luck thrown in as well."

Kesshisan,cheatatmathhomework,1390511305.0,"I'm not sure if this is the most elegant way, but I found a solution:

a x^(2) + b x + c factors into x minus the right hand side of the quadratic equation.  However it's +/- sqrt blah blah, so you have one of each:

a x^(2) + b x + c = (x - (-b + sqrt...) ) (x - (-b - sqrt...) )

(I didn't fill in the quadratic equation to make it more readable.)

When A B and C are constants, the entire right hand side of the quadratic equation is a constant.

let m = -b + sqrt..., let n = -b - sqrt...

a x^(2) + b x + c = (x - m)(x - n)

We can now rewrite the original equation as:

1/[ (x - m) (x - n) ]

Which you can do partial fractions on.  After partial fractions you can apply a LaPlace transformation.  It doesn't get pretty if you try to rewrite everything in terms of A B and C, but it gets the job done.  Hopefully someone will post a more elegant way, as this is basically using ""brute force"" and ugly.

Also, don't forget to include things like a != 0, and b^(2)-4ac &gt;= 0, once you start the quadratic-equation-style-factoring."

I got blind drunk and freaked out.  I got in my car and started driving.  I made it about 100 miles.  I was speeding in a fog bank at 3 in the morning on an interstate highway.  I came up behind a semi in the fog, I swerved to avoid rear-ending him.  Overcompensated to the right and found myself sliding sideways on the wet road... @ 70 mph.  Wheels grabbed and car lurched into the back wheels of the semi's trailer.  Miraculously my car glanced off, instead of going under the tires.  My car is now stalled and totaled in the left lane of the interstate where the speed limit is 75 and the fog has reduced viability to less than 50 feet.   
State Patrol shows up.  They make me blow.  I'm well over the limit.  They give me a roadside sobriety test.  I pass every part.  
The cop looks at me and says, ""you drink a lot, don't you son?""  Hands me a ticket for ""Driving too fast for conditions"" and ""expired tags""  total was no points and about $150 in fines.  Put me in the tow truck and sent me on my way.

wolfkin,AskMen,1390511394.0,"just keep it simple. keep it calm. Your friends with this girl. Focus on that part of the relationship. You like her you like hanging out with her.

That should be the impression you want to leave. You don't need to leave an impression of the relationship. The daughter will do that for you. As a first meeting I'd keep the contact b/w the girl casual but strictly friendly. If you normally hold hands, then hold hands if she offers. If you give her a kiss keep it clean and rare. You're just friends. Everything you do should be thru that filter. After they get to know you, you can be tied at the hip and maybe even some light making out if they're ok with it but for that initial night tone it down.

The parents are like teachers at a baseball game. They're still elders you have to be polite to. But they're not going to send you to detention. Be yourself just don't be your relationship. Show them how you are when you're just her friend."

ZapActions-dower,Games,1390511449.0,"Yes, that is true.  But you can't be outside the system.  You can't be factionless.  If you are an Argonian, you *must* be Ebonheart and quite chipper about working for the same race that has enslaved and will enslave your race for centuries.  If you're a Khajiit, you sign up to fight with the elves likes it's no big deal.

In no other TES game (excluding possibly the mobile/other games) are you signed up for any faction without choice.  You may have to do it to get to X event or something like that, but if you wanted to you could still go and do all sort of other things and join other factions if you so desired.  In Morrowind, you could be a Temple-worshipping member of House Redoran, which would naturally believe that working for the Empire to be against their beliefs, and never do the first thing for the main quest, and still have a very full experience.

The factions are Aldmeri Dominion (altmer, bosmer, khajitt) Ebonheart Pact (Nord, dunmer, Argonian) and Daggerfall Alliance (breton, orc, redguard.)  You as a player have a choice, but your character doesn't.  Which leads them to doing things that don't really make sense for a character of that race to do, such as an Argonian fighting alongside dunmer for the control of Cyrodiil."

cphers,fantasywriters,1390511450.0,"My world is a mix of gothic horror and fantasy. I have some of the usual fantasy races like trolls and elves (actually, they're just different terms for the same race). Instead of the Tolkien/DnD model though, I draw most of my inspiration from the original mythology and fairy tales where the races are more unknown, malevolent and sinister, and obviously heavily influenced by primal fears of the time (like child mortality). Look up things like the fair folk, huldufolk, or changelings. And of course, creepy ancient forests, witchcraft, and necromancy play heavily into it as well.

Another thing I do it switch the genre of the same story by simply changing the POV. When it's from the human perspective it tends to be more gothic horror, while from the huldufolk perspective it's more heroic fantasy."

That said, regardless of what PFF graded them I unabashedly would take Chancellor every time.

Something which you pointed out, is very important. 

No its not a ""hate diatribe"" against religion.  Its a protest against certain kinds of ""Christians"". ""Religion"", (the organized efforts of humans to worship), has huge problems, but this issue has to do mainly with people who are not thinking with enough independence.

""Anti-religious""   hmm

After 2 years of seminary I left with my faith gone. 

Why?  Because what was being taught and promoted had nothing to do with Christ or Christianity. Instead ""religiousity"" and conformance to authority was being promoted over reasoning and thinking.

I got my faith back thanks to Science, a deeper understanding of this universe and the understanding of the social structures that so called ""religious Christians"" engage in.

animuseternal,writing,1390512069.0,"I'm actually not a copywriter (three years as a technical writer though), but I'm pretty sure I can answer most of these since they're more about industry than the specific role:

&gt; alternate job titles

This I actually don't know. The above post that mentions ""content specialist"" is probably right-on. Technical writers are often given the title of ""telecommunications specialists"" or something similar ... I imagine copywriters probably use that same label as well.

&gt; How much does it pay on average?

This depends on where you live and what company you work for. I can't imagine tech writers and copywriters make dramatically different salaries, so for some reference: I've applied to other locations than where I live and have seen the range for these positions fall anywhere between $20,000 a year and $125,000 a year. Seriously.

Although some context: where I live, the median salary for a single-income household is around $100k a year. My first job as a tech writer in this area paid $25k. My second was twice that amount (and was still an entry-level position). The ""average"" cap for this kind of role in this area--from what I've seen--is around $65-70k ... so well-below the median.

&gt; Is it a typical 9-5...?

Depends on the job, the terms of employment, the contract, etc. But most often, yes, you'll be operating somewhere close to traditional business hours. I officially work 9-5 myself, but on occasion have to clock 50-60 hour weeks.

&gt; How many entry-level jobs...?

I don't know how I'm supposed to have the context for this. In what city? What kinds of companies? Who are the company's clients or what is their main product? What is their release cycle like and does the production of copy coincide with product releases or does it coincide with other factors?

&gt; Competition

What is on par with most other fields...? I work in software engineering. Technical writers can either be in REALLY high demand (if the company uses them) or just after-thoughts. It depends. Copywriters are likely to be in higher demand, but there are UX (User Experience) Specialists out there who do nothing but research and study the effect of micro-copy / nomenclature / cognitive linguistics and consumer purchasing patterns. They might take a lot of the jobs.

Here's what I think about middle class jobs in the mid-2010s: it's all competitive. The market is over-saturated with qualified people of all stripes and strengths. After you've gotten about 2-3 years of work experience, finding work is a LOT easier. But we're all competing. Entry-level by nature is more competitive because most applicants have fairly blank resumes and there's a lack of specificity in the applicant's strengths and in the job listing as well. You're often hired based on hunches and personality.

&gt; Standing out

First, format your resume. Use a layout of some kind. Don't be that person who just types into a blank word document. Make your resume into a sheet of paper that *reflects all of your strengths and qualifications*. Make it something that you're proud to show to people.

Second, especially if you're looking to work as a writer of any kind ... choose sentences and verbs that reflect a *measurable* quality of some kind. Don't just describe your skills, but show the effect of your skills. Just like in creative writing, you want to be able to show your character.

Third, before your interview, research the company. Not enough people do this. Don't only research the company, but research the industry of the company, and not from a consumer perspective. There are tons of business books out there for any number of industries and being able to talk about industry practices/trends/innovations from a management or productivity perspective is going to be helpful.

Hopefully that's useful to you."

Indorill,htpc,1390512177.0,"Unless you were totally strapped for cash I wouldnt recomend those parts for an HTPC.  They are capable of performing the tasks you want, but you are only saving $150 max on your build.  That $150 you save also pigeon holes you into a a dead socket type, and gives you a hotter, louder, and less efficient HTPC.   

Instead of building off of the CPU/GPU you currently own, I would recomend getting an FM2+ motherboard and a cheap Richland APU.  When prices fall in a year or so you can upgrade to one of the newer APUs.   The a8-6600 APU is more than adequate for big picture gaming.  


For wireless peripherals, I just use a wireless keyboard/mouse and a wireless 360 controller.  I have no need for anything else.  

For the ultimate home media setup, you can also look into getting some sort of network storage so you dont have to worry about cramming HDDs into your HTPC.  If you dont care about your eletric bill any old PC is a great start for a cheap home media server.  Or they sell dedicated machines just for that purpose.

HTPC have got to look good if you want girlfriend approval.  So I recommend starting off by picking out a nice case that will look good in your living room.  Then build the quietest and most efficient thing you can in that case."

Junoh315,pcmasterrace,1390512260.0,"My opinion on this is that the lower market-share for their GPUs with gaming might make developers think twice about using Mantle.  Unless Nvidia adopts it as well then it might end up flat-lining before it had a chance to really shine.  There is another solution and that is the end of crypto-currencies.  If litecoin and dogecoin disappear then the cards will lower in price again.

I don't see anything good coming from this besides more money for AMD.  I just hope that they don't think that cryptocurrency miners are a bigger target demographic and sacrifice gaming performance for OpenCL integration and more complex computing.

The best solution would be for AMD to create a dedicated mining card so that they could separate the gamers from the miners."

intrinsicdisorder,xxfitness,1390512295.0,"In English:

Establish one rep max for close-grip bench press.

Divide this number by 10.  Ideally, it should be your eight-rep max for the following exercises at tempo 3020*: Trap-3 raise, Powell raise, external rotation**.  You will probably be weaker than that with these exercises.  

Follow the program as listed for workouts 1 through 6 with the three exercises.  ""3x12-15"" means 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps.  By ""start light"", he isn't kidding--he means VERY light if you need to, even just the weight of your arm; I've seen very, very strong people doing these things with, like, 2.5 to 5 lb plates.  But do try to progress with weight, even if just a tiny bit, as you go through the workouts!  Make sure your shoulder stays in a good position throughout the movement.  And stick to the tempo--it is very, very helpful.

It wouldn't be unreasonable to just go through a cycle of this before even testing your close-grip bench 1RM, since you are a pretty new lifter (thus, maxes don't really matter much since they go up so easily...plus, you might not be familiar enough with the movement to do it super safely with the heaviest thing you can possibly move!) and it sounds like you're rocking some pretty serious instability.

Good luck, hope that helps!


*Tempo 3020 means 3 seconds for the concentric part of the motion, 0 seconds at the ""top"" of the rep, 2 seconds for the eccentric part, 0 seconds rest before you go into the next rep.

**You can probably Youtube some videos."

Tall_LA_Bull,BDSMcommunity,1390512314.0,"I've dealt with this situation a good bit. I'm a very emotionally stable and naturally dominant person, and anxious sub girls tend to reeeally like how being around me makes them feel. Thus it has happened multiple times that a girl I've dated/played with has gotten in a little over her head, and fallen pretty hard for me, pretty quickly. In more than one case, the resulting power imbalance has turned out to be a powerful turn-on for the sub. Meaning, she really loved how much more she wanted/needed me than I did her.

In my opinion, those kind of dynamics--where an imbalance in commitment/depth of feeling itself becomes sexualized--are almost always poisonous to the relationship. I've started to take great care in my relationships to make sure this sort of dynamic doesn't develop, because it causes needless pain and tends to kill the dynamic.

This doesn't mean it's not ""okay"" to engage in. I don't think things like ""okay/not okay"" or ""moral/immoral"" are helpful distinctions when it comes to fully consensual relationships. My opinion just means that is usually seems to destroy the relationship after a while, for the simple reason that even if it turns the sub on, it still also makes them feel anxious and insecure. GENUINELY anxious and insecure, because they know that it's not just pretend--You, the dom, genuinely could devastate them at any moment.

I'm not trying to make a blanket statement. I'm sure there's a couple, somewhere, who could engage in this sort of kink and it would work great for them. But, in general, I think it's asking for trouble. D/s relationships only work when there's mutual confidence and trust and caring. What you're describing hammers at the very base of that."

anfee_,brisbane,1390512560.0,"Town house of three, average to heavy electricity usage. 

Electricity is around $450 a quarter 
Water is included in the rent (like most places) but some will charge if you go over a certain limit, real estate will advise if you're in that situation. 

Don't forget phone/internet, depending on the place you go you may only be able to have adsl not adsl2 or naked (depends on the phone line set up into the house, I don't think you can check that beforehand) so factor line rental in as well. Line rental is around $30 and bundling you can get smallish download limit for another $20 or for $50 you can get 250GB (iinet). 


As you've never had to set up stuff before, keep in mind you want to organise your electricity at least a week before, so they come out on the day (or day before) and switch your meter over, or turn it on depending on the situation. If the place is empty you can also get the phone/internet started before you move in and it takes anywhere from 3-10 business days to get set up. 

Being your first time likely needing to pay bills you may want to look into hiking your 'rent' up to cover your overestimated bill costs (multiplied to a year, divided by however you pay your rent) so you're never caught short.

Women who are younger typically are, or believe they are, more attractive than older ones.  That's the generalization anyway.  Getting laid as a lady is easy when you're 20.  That's the fisherman with the net.

Reagansmash1994,funny,1390512694.0,"Posts like this tend to grind my gears.

Avoiding the fact that you selected U.S. Edition, why on earth would you expect an American news station to be that concerned with international politics.

News doesn't give priority to what is most important. That is the sad fact of life. Most major news corporations are competing for ratings and tend to air what is important to their core demographic. 

Justin Bieber being arrested is prime celebrity news, which in our celebrity obsessed culture, is important in the west. Is it more important that riots in Ukraine? No. But the news tends to play domestic news over international, this is how news works.

In my Media Ethics seminar last week, we were discussing why international news is important to us personally. The main reason is that understanding the world around you is important and if you care about international news, you can find relevant articles and stories about the story online, thanks to the internet. Expecting the news to decide what is important to you personally is retarded.

I know that this is a cheap attempt to karma whore by highlighting the disparity of the facts of the world and what 'Americans' find important. Or an attempt to call the news retarded, but in all honesty, until you have a basic understanding of how news works and why certain stories are valued over others, then you're just a fuck wit spouting nonsense.

Also, what on earth about this is funny? I could understand someone posting it to WTF, but /r/funny? What sort of standards do we hold over here that a news station posting topical western celebrity news is funny?

At this point, my flowers are fat bricks, my plants are half collapsed with 30+ strings throughout the greenhouse holding branches up so they don't break, not that pretty to look at any more. But at least my plants are healthy, no nute burn or deficiencies; just some droopiness from the cold temperatures, but it just makes the buds swell.

The entire process from chop to trim took about 2 1/2 weeks last season. I pull 1 plant a day. I rush through the first 1/10 (2 days of manicuring) before fatigue comes in. I get all the help I can, which usually amounts to me doing about 4/10 of the entire harvest myself. 

We usually have Netflix (usually a common show everyone has seen so it's not overly distracting) or music playing; some people complain when their trimmer help is distracted; personally I'm just happy to have help. I don't mind if they take their time as long as it gets done, because 4 people working at 70% is sure as hell a lot faster than 1 person at 100% (me) bored out of their wits.

Cykuta,news,1390512825.0,"We are. Unfortunately, politics is an area where everything is muddy.

This was (naturally) a closely guarded secret, and when it got out, you can bet people weren't happy. The problem is that we're a very intolerant country, especially where religion is concerned, and - as much as it's shameful to admit it - many people have no problem with others being tortured as long as they're ""some dirty Arabs.""

A lot of people in Poland are also infatuated with the USA and the American approach (call it imperialistic, or trigger-happy, or whatever - the fact that the US throw their weight about because you have this huge fuck-off military): it appeals to our own nationalism, our lack of respect for minorities and general lack of subtlety (which alienates us from Western Europe) and, above all, our victim complex. Like the weak kid that got bullied, we're desperate to be friends with bullies. Or at least other strong kids. This attitude includes our politicians, big time.

Hence why they would agree to practically anything, as long as the US promised that this time it would allow us to hang out with the cool kids. Which they do a lot, they just never deliver, and somehow our politicians are too scared to just go Bill Murray and say, ""Fuck it, we'll try to make this work without American Alms.""

**TL;DR:** Polish politicians should know better, but they're desperate to please the US which they see as the only counter-balance to Russia so they'll lick american arse and thank for the opportunity."

IVs and EVs were implanted from the very first generation. They were simply meant to give a little diversity and make trained 'mons stronger than wild/caught 'mons. In gen 2, shinies were introduced, and the shininess was tied to it's IVs. Due to how the game made it's calculations, this meant that shinies usually had low IVs overall. This also meant that breeding shinies had better chances of yielding baby shinies. PokeRus was also introduced and too was tied to IVs.

I don't know much about gen 3, 4 and 5 mechanics, but I do know that shininess was calculated by the PID (Pokemon ID, though I not _quite_ sure about my claim here) of the 'mon. Your Trainer ID and Secret ID played a role in there.

I actually decked a nurse when she told me that I ""needed to stop moving and lay down"" (I was sitting up at the time), after repeatedly telling her that I couldn't, and it hurt too bad. She basically told me to suck it up, and pushed my shoulders down so they could scan me--I felt like everything in my abdomen just broke, it was excruciating. I hit her as hard as a 14-year-old girl could, and got restrained, they got another picture, made me sit crying for an hour in a room, and then had doctors rushing in. One gave me a shot, and I instantly started feeling sleepy, and I remember him looking at my mom with this horribly grim face and said ""Your daughter is dying, we need to take her to Children's because we can't help her here"" and something about following the ambulance. I remember foggy bits of the ride, and waking up a few hours later to my mom crying, and a doctor drawing something on a napkin for her, explaining what was going on. They told me I had just had a small heart attack, and that the lower half of my right lung was basically dead at the moment, and that there was a huge clot. I passed out again and didn't wake up for another 4 days, in the ICU. The next 2 weeks were a blur. I was only 14. 


I'm 24 now, it came down to me being homozygous for Factor V Leiden disorder, and two other things I can't remember the name of, since they have something to do with a gene mutation.

michaelnoir,AskReddit,1390513147.0,"The argument against the ""it's human nature"" argument is this: For most of the time that Homo Sapiens has existed, they were hunter-gatherers, living in small groups or tribes of maybe 100 people or so. These hunter-gatherer tribes, like modern hunter-gatherers, were usually fairly egalitarian in their social structure. This was necessarily the case because co-operation was needed in the hunt. Also, as is shown by studies of modern hunter-gatherer tribes, these people did not think of themselves as individuals, but as members of a tribe. Their tribe usually had a totem animal of some kind, and all the members of the tribe thought of themselves as descended from it, whether they were related or not. 

Mankind is a very social species. In the hunt, co-operation was required. Human women usually need the support of their conspecifics when giving birth, and humans have an unusually long childhood, requiring co-operation to bring them up. Also, human females are one of the few animals to have a menopause, which perhaps also evolved as a way to ensure the collective, social bringing up of children. Lastly, and most importantly, humans have developed a uniquely sophisticated set of shared meanings called language and culture. 

Now, if we're hardwired for anything, it is something like the above. Please look at how long we were hunter-gatherers as opposed to agriculturalists, as plotted on a graph or something. Someone described it to me thus: He stretched out his arms at his sides as wide as he could, and pointed out that if the span of his arms represented the entire time that modern humans have existed, then agriculture would have begun somewhere on his left index finger. (As for industrialism, employment for wages, ie, capitalism, that would start right on the tip of the finger). 

For all that time, we were hunter-gatherers who lived in small, fairly egalitarian groups. No doubt there was fighting between these groups, but within the groups, they seem to have had a fairly egalitarian structure, probably with an animistic religion and a totem animal from whom they considered themselves descended. The proceeds of the hunt were probably shared equally among the members of the tribe, for good practical reasons. 

With the onset of agriculture and the start of urbanisation, the social structure began to change. Now there was a surplus of food, grain which could be stored. This surplus of food meant that it was possible for people to live without hunting. Thus we get division of labour, people who speciailised in building or being craftsmen or what have you.
We also at this time get the rise of a priestly caste, who take it upon themselves to interpret the will of the gods, and to direct what sacrifices are necessary, taking their share, of course, of the sacrificial offerings and maintaining secrecy in the inner sanctums of their ziggurats and pyramids.

This priestly caste was the origin of hierarchical organisation in human societies. They lived without working, on the proceeds of sacrificial offerings, and surplus foodstuffs produced by farmers. The political and media and business elites of today are the heirs of this priestly caste, taking it upon themselves to interpret the world to those of us further down the pyramid. 
Out of this priestly caste then emerged a god-king, a divine or semi-divine figure called a king or a pharaoh or what have you. These societies usually gave symbolic form to their ideal in the form of a pyramid or ziggurat of some kind, with the king-pharaoh at the top, as an earthly echo of the hierarchy that prevailed among the gods in the sky.

They maintained their power through mysticism, obfuscation, and ritual, and by inculcating a sort of false consciousness in the people, by encouraging them to believe that the regime they represented was eternal, inevitable, and natural. 

This was the origin of hierarchy and of the state. The person at the bottom of the pyramid was a felaheen, a peasant, or a slave. The pyramidal structure was echoed everywhere, even in the home, where the father was at the apex and his wife and children under him. In the Middle Ages a similar structure developed, called feudalism, with the same pyramidal structure, but now the person at the bottom of the pyramid was called a serf or peasant. 

Now, to get back to human nature, surely you can see how little all this has to do with anything natural. This hierarchical rule was on the contrary highly artificial, late, and imposed. People throughout history have chafed against it, and the injustice and inappropriateness of these structures has grown more and more obvious over the years. 
What is ""human nature"" after all? Well, human nature is just whatever humans do. But humans do a *lot* of things. Above all, the behaviour of humans at any given place and time is going to be incredibly influenced by the social and economic institutions of their given societies. If human nature was fixed, then it would tend to produce fixed social forms, but we know this is far from the case. 

So this is my opinion: The specific economic and social forms that our society takes are not dictated by our ""nature"", rather our natures are, to a large extent, dictated by the specific economic and social forms that our society takes. Levels of selfishness and altruism are functions of specific societies and economies. If we have a society where selfishness and greed are rewarded, then people will be selfish and greedy. 

I'm interested in the *actuality* of ""human nature"". My opinion is this: Man is both a social animal and an individual. His best qualities are freedom, dignity, creativity, enquiry. He's not an ant in a collectivist anthill, and he's not Robinson Crusoe on an island, narrowly calculating his own profits and losses, either. It should be possible to see yourself at one and the same time, as an individualist and as a member of a social species. This to my mind doesn't present a contradiction, in fact it's close to the ""species character"" of man. 

Now to bring us into the present. After the Reformation happened, there came the Enlightenment. New, Protestant man began to look at the world without superstition but also with an instrumental bias. He began to see it as a machine, a giant piece of clockwork with a deity outside of it who had set it all into motion but then interfered no more. 
He began to see nature as something to be *used*, and himself as outside of it. 

The American and French revolutions of the 18th century were in the last analysis bourgeois revolutions. They represented the triumph of this bourgeois class, newly enlightened, and given to empiricism and instrumentalism. This class rejected the old aristocratic taboo against dabbling in commerce, and embraced mercantilism. The mystification of spirit was replaced with the mystification of *things*, the basic unit of aspiration and social exchange became the *commodity*. This class did not have to enslave, it preferred to *use*, to exploit. 

But the same pyramidal structure was there, and ritual, mystification, and myth was used in the same way, to justify rule. The same false consciousness was inculcated, the same idea that the present system was eternal, natural, and inevitable. Eventually more modern ideas were called into service to prop up this ideology, like distorted Darwinism and a corrupted, literalist version of Christianity. 

We can thank the bourgeois revolutions for breaking the chains of feudalism, aristocracy, and religious mysticism, perhaps forever. And we can thank capitalism for making the world one place, by its relentless drive for profit in every corner of the globe. 
But in the end we have to reject both, because they have given rise to highly dysfunctional forms, as well as the most lethal and irrational ideas imaginable. We have got to form horizontal organizations and not chains of command and hierarchies. People, left to their own devices, do this naturally anyway. They voluntarily associate with the friends and the groups that they choose, they don't get involved in rigid chains of command and master-servant relationships. 

One last word on hierarchy: It may be that, as you say, a certain amount of hierarchy is natural. This kind of hierarchy I have no problem with. For instance, you're better than me at something, so I defer to your ""authority"" in that area. To take the example of the hunter-gatherer, one hunter can run faster than another, another is better at throwing a spear, etc. That's fine.
But that has no implications for political organisation. The kind of hierarchy that is objected to is permanent, involuntary hierarchy, imposed from without, that you can't get away from. You have a king or boss over you, and there is no option not to have a king or boss over you. This strikes me as a most unnatural state of affairs, contrary to the ""species character"" of man as I outlined above. 

If I want to form a relationship with someone which could be said to be ""hierarchical"", ie, he's better than me at something so I defer to his authority in that area, that's fine, but the important thing is that it be completely voluntary, and I must be able to dissolve that relationship at any time. 

And finally, I'll leave you with this quote from George Orwell, when he addressed the ""it's human nature argument"" in a newspaper column: ""after all, if human nature never changes, why is it that we not only don’t practise cannibalism any longer, but don’t even want to?""

Looks like a perfect false 9. I took out Benat for Cesc. Cesc is just a better overall player with sick passing. If you think you're going to miss Benat's long shots, that's why I added IF Rakitic. He's a good passer and fairly tall so he'll hold onto the ball well in the midfield while waiting for the wings to get open. Overall I tried to add better passers because you said you do a lot of passing. You didn't mention any problems on defense so I didn't change anything. If having attacking workrates on both your CBs bothers you, I'd switch Pique for Pepe. My personal preference would also be Thibaut Courtois over Valdes, but that's just my preference and keep using Valdes if you have no problems. "

SammaSunshine,relationships,1390513464.0,"After reading her arguments, I knew that lecturing her on her worldview isn't going to help. Rome wasn't built in a day, you can't argue with someone anonymously online and expect them to change their entire point of view. Though I do hope it has given her some food for thought. 

When you are raised a certain way and are never taught to question it, of course you're going to argue. I can't possibly comprehend where she is coming from, because I was raised SO differently. Its kind of strange, because we are both from the US, we are the same gender, and the same age. 

My opinion on arranged marriages doesn't matter at all in this situation. The advice she asked for was how to make him love her, and thats just not advice anyone can give. I hope that she reads my comment and thinks about it. A healthy relationship starts with healthy people."

am5437435,Music,1390513500.0,"Obviously the answer to this question is highly subjective, but I've listened to and love many of the bands listed ITT.

The second part of the question, ""and appreciate every song,"" is the difficulty with the question.  First of all, what do you mean by appreciate?  But secondly, if there is even one song that I don't like, then that band is disqualified?

So the only possible answer I can think of is The Beatles.  Every single song is good (to varying degrees - looking at you ""Don't Pass Me By"").  Every single song is worth listening to.

Every band or artist has bad songs, or a song you don't like, or a song that you skip every time on the album.  The Beatles are probably the only band, ever, that doesn't.  **MAYBE** Zeppelin.

Even Radiohead doesn't qualify.  I rarely listen to Pablo Honey.  I have no interest in it.  

Maybe Neutral Milk Hotel?  Only 2 records.  Other bands with very small discographies could also qualify.

LCD Soundsystem?

Ultimately, I think without a better definition of ""appreciate,"" this question is unanswerable."

marco262,rpg,1390513533.0,"In my experience, I notice the opposite. When you have people who are only partly knowledgeable, they're more likely to speak in a know-it-all tone, as they feel the need to prove they're smart. They feel they must TELL you things to SHOW you how smart they are. 

By contrast, the people who actually know their shit up, down, and sideways are much more relaxed. They speak more in casual tones, though they may use technical terms as if they were a part of casual speech. Which, for them, they usually are. Real experts will SHARE their knowledge with others, without the obvious need to prove how intelligent they are, and are often much more approachable because of it. 

Ninja edit: However, this isn't meant to contradict your claim that you need confidence. It's just not something that goes into arrogance, for most experts I've talked to. For the fake know it all, if someone were to contradict them, they'd get defensive and argumentative. A real expert would get confused that someone was so wrong about reality, or possibly just shrug and move on. 

Naturally, there are real experts out there who are arrogant assholes that feel the need to constantly show off how much they know. But in my experience, they're the minority.

In your example in the description you use, ""I generally do not find myself attracted to fat women"". That is very different than stating a positive preference. That is a negative preference.

He believed with such ardour that you could dig a trench in anything if you just tried hard enough that the GM actually allowed him to dig one sideways.  Through a cave-in in a space hulk.  That means that with a completely normal entrenching tool, he managed to dig a tunnel through about thirty metres of plasteel as if he were going through wet earth.  He was extremely surprised when he got to the end and found that there wasn't a lot left of his entrenching tool, and spent the rest of the session (which also covered the rest of his life) searching desperately for anything that could fill the hole left by its destruction.

Nacke,Christianity,1390513706.0,"I want to start this with saying no offense okey. Things might sound harsh but i will answer from my prespective of thought since you asked.



**John 14:6**
*Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.*

**Romans 10:9**
*Because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.*




Things here seem very clear. The only way to heaven is through him. And this might sound harsh? Yes it is. But if someone commits a crime and goes to the judge, the judge isn't evil just because he is strict right? He is doing what he must. I think the same is with god. He has to judge people for their crime but that doesn't make him evil. 

What is this crime? Are we punished for not worshiping him? No. We are punished for sin. 


**Romans 3:23**
*For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,*

Exacly. Heaven is way to holy for sinners. We all are sinners. None of us deserve heaven! But we are offered the most beutiful gift of all and that is forgiveness, and our only way to forgiveness is through Jesus who sacrificed himself for humanity. 

**Romans 6:23**
*For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.*


All of this is my view of things and i personally think it's very clear. But i know many people on this subreddit have different views on this topic so i can't answer for all of us. 
But please ask questions if there is anything. I will gladly do my best to answer. "

MattieShoes,hearthstone,1390513758.0,"I still have a hard time with the spell cards because many can be very situational.  I don't have a good feel for how many to take, which to skip, etc.

Minions where the sum of the two values is more than double the mana cost are generally good (e.g. a 3/2 for 2 mana, etc).  You have to take into account their abilities, but you don't want to overpay for abilities that may not turn out to be useful.  Health and damage are almost always useful!  4 attack is slightly more useful because of priest... He can destroy creatures with higher or lower attack via spells, but not 4.

Don't take too many high-cost cards -- 2, 3, 4 seems to be the sweet spot because they can be used early, or comboed later.  A couple high cost cards is fine, but... moderation is good.

Card draw is always good.

Don't try to stack your deck chock full of taunt minions... Enemies will usually target your minions whether or not they have taunt, so you'll end up paying for nothing.  A few taunt minions are just fine, just not every one you see, ya know?

Spellpower +1 cards are nice, but it seems they are relatively expensive cost-wise.  So I wouldn't fixate on them. 

Cards that fill multiple roles are nice.  For instance, both card draw and spellpower:

http://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/280-azure-drake

But it's a bit on the expensive side, 5 for a 4/4.  Depends on what else you pick up I suppose.

Asteroids are indeed stony, but they often have a significant iron component as well.  

It's worth noting that these things were named before they were understood as physical phenomena (like so many things), so our modern empirical basis for categorizing things is merely making use of, rather than necessarily staying totally faithful to, existing words like comets and asteroids.  So historically, asteroids were objects that once appeared like stars, while comets were objects with the visible tails (which are from evaporating ice). The above info about which part of the solar system they're from is more useful from the perspective of studying the solar system, planetary evolution, as well as the threat of comet and asteroid impacts."

They're playing a series where the main plot device is technology that lets you control the lives of people in the past somehow, where its representation of pirates is completely inaccurate from the real thing, where an ""assassin"" can go around on a killing spree and just go back to their daily routine without much trouble, and they're complaining about a WoC being a playable character."

However, I realize that in no way accounts for the fact that everybody can handle at least a little alcohol, but something like 2-3% of people who try acid kind of lose it mentally.

(You may have seen me post this recently somewhere else.)

You need two events, two restaurants, two after dinner activities, and two costumes/love making styles. Write what each is on a piece of paper and place it in an envelope, on the envelope write something vaguely descriptive. Your partner picks one of the two as the evening goes. For instance: A high energy event and a low energy event, label the envelopes as 'High Energy' and 'Low Energy'. You can do things like go to a firing range, rock climbing, hiking, shopping, whatever you think your partner would like. A fancy restaurant and a low key place. After dinner ""In"" or ""Out"" as in stay in and watch a movie or go out for drinks/pool/to the movies/whatever. And finally ""Naughty"" and ""Nice"" or ""Gentle"" and ""Rough"" or whatever.

This way you still plan an evening for your partner and they get to enjoy it, but they still have a say in the tempo of the evening."

Find your weakest point and focus on that for a while until it becomes autonomous muscle memory and you no longer have you think about it, then move onto your next weakest point and so on. Slowly you will eradicate your bad habits and you can move onto focussing on advanced plays.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390514282.0,"Your approach to capturing the roughness of the wood surface is quite interesting. Effective, and it definitely conveys an unsanded quality, but at the same time we can still see a lot of scribbling. It's a good start on capturing specific surface qualities, but you should work towards relying more on intentional strokes in your future pieces.

Also, I can see that you incorporated your initial line lay-in as part of the piece. That itself is fine to do, but I would recommend that if you do take that route, clean up your edges and blend those lines back into your form. You don't want the lines themselves to appear to be actual lines, as that will undermine the viewer's sense of looking at a three dimensional form. Also, the extreme darks left over from your linework provide areas of extremely high contrast, which draw the eye. You may not want the viewer's eye drifting to those areas, so perhaps doing your linework in a more mid-tone range, and then adding your high-contrast darks strategically afterwards would work out better."

The reality of it is that IP alone cannot identify a unique individual, especially in an age of prevalent wifi.

I have previously thought of doing some wardriving around houses of politicians and judges who supported the IP=unique individual idea, cracking their wifi and downloading things guaranteed to raise flags with the MAFIAA watchdogs.

We would have times where I would feel guilty and tell her I smoked with a friend or something and the cycle starts again. I eventually just hid it from her, while during this time many new research was coming out showing lots of benefits to using the plant, or that it wasn't as harmful as she thought. She found a stash I had hidden at one point and was mad about it of course. We got past that, I threw my shit away to appease her. As time went on, I continued expressing to her factual studies and information about cannabis, things she never would have considered to be true, she started shifting her opinion. As time progressed she changed from 100% against it, to someone who saw it's benefit. It was amazing, not long after we went out and purchased a bong together, and I was smoking with no fighting or hassle. A few weeks passed this she was curious about trying it, she smoked a little bit and we and had a blast laughing and eating CiCi's Pizza.

In general though it comes down to impulse control. A lot of people (myself included) love attention from the opposite sex. I mean *love*. Many don't know where to draw the line, how to say no. The thing to remember is that flattery, attention, affection... they all feel *fantastic*. But so do a lot of things, and we have to learn to control our urges.

Most people learn how to draw boundaries. Because life without rules is chaotic, exhausting. Some don't learn. Some haven't learned. Some thrive on the chaos. Some don't place another's feelings on par with their own. Some are used to ""I'm sorry"" being enough to keep them out of trouble. In the end, they are all people, who somehow justify hurting someone else for their own satisfaction. Not everyone is like that. Not everyone does that to others. 

It's worth it to keep looking because every new person teaches you something. If you do nothing, you learn nothing. If you learn nothing, you stagnate. If you're going to just sit there stagnant, what's the point? So get moving."

ibbity,AskWomen,1390514469.0,"I believe that many men, especially young men, are having difficulty finding a masculine identity because the traditional male role in Western society has been much more resistant to shift and open up than has the female role. Imo many young men today are in a similar place to where many young women were during the First Wave of feminism---they're confused by all the new things going on and aren't really sure who they're supposed to be now that the traditional gender role they were always pushed towards isn't as set in stone anymore. I have a lot of sympathy for young guys who are legitimately struggling to figure out what they're supposed to do with themselves in this way. 

I do not, however, have sympathy for the smaller but unfortunately more vocal contingent who have decided that the solution to this problem isn't to re-examine the masculine role and the trappings of traditional masculinity objectively to see which parts are beneficial and which destructive, to discard the destructive parts while bolstering up the beneficial ones, or to widen the definition of ""manliness"" so as to allow for men who don't fit the traditional stereotype to be themselves and not be looked down on. Men who look at the problem and decide that the solution is to shame and verbally attack men who aren't stereotypically manly, who think the way to regain their balance is to take away all the gains that women have made legally and socially, and to lock everyone into iron-clad anachronistic gender roles whether they like it or not---those men can take a hike.

As for what is to be done about it? I don't think that's something that women necessarily can or should be telling men, any more than men could or should have been telling women what *they* should have done about their own confusion when the female gender role first began to break down and open up. Finding your own identity is something that has to be figured out from inside, not from someone else telling you what to do. The best advice I can give is to try and see who and what you are *as a person,* because that's the best starting point I can think of. That, and if you want inspiration as to what kind of *man* you want to be, find yourself some male role models who are the kind of man you want to be and try to emulate them in the things that you admire about them."

bobbyg27,TrueReddit,1390514500.0,"Good rundown. So how can we (as a society) fix? This is a market failure; economic resources (a willing, valuable, contributing member to society) are struggling to continue adding value to society.

One question: if this person is smart, ambitious, hardworking, and has high integrity (a model employee), how come they can only get a minimum wage job?

I'm assuming this person has no friends or family who is willing to help, despite the individual's good nature and good intentions... fine.

Having a roommate would be a good idea for further rent cost savings. I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to find, for example, a $600 slightly bigger living space, perhaps in a better part of town relative to work, and get a roommate to split the cost. Or heck just get someone to share the $400/month spot.

This doesn't mean things are rosy, just a few ideas to help this hypothetical person.  There is still a real problem which is the lack of true talent assessment in society."

In the course of my jobs I have been assaulted by a meth head prostitute in a West Virginia and I have caught and treated medical problems missed by ER doctors who should know better.     

What I have learned some people define themselves by their job and that is OK if it works for them. Others don't and that's OK if it works for them. I define myself by the other things I do. My job(s) mostly exist so I can do all of the other things in life. I am a massage therapist because it's fun. I did other things because they payed well and I was good at them. Others I hated, payed poorly and I did them so I wouldn't starve.   

  I'm rambling, let me try and get back on point. You sound young. If you are still living with your parents, that's a hell of a safety net. Research other jobs. Take some adult education classes in things that sound interesting. I don't necessary mean for credit or because they look good on a resume, though bonus points if they do. Apply for any job that looks interesting. Note interesting jobs are often word of mouth. Meet new people from outside of your age group, social and economic circles. Try new things and a few calculated risks for a few years and most likely drift toward a better situation.

Triteleia,BPD,1390514702.0,"As my friend always said I ""emotionally blackmail"" people without even trying. So I left one day while doing laundry at the laundromat on my bike after getting really mad at my friend who I thought was just using me. I was just wearing jeans, a t-shirt, and a longsleeve button-up. I live about 30 miles from the Sierras so all I did was bike north-east during the beginning of December when there was a cold snap.


My plan was to bike until my bike malfunctioned, then walk into the woods that were isolated enough and let myself die of exposure. The thing was that people I met along the way gave me jackets and a sleeping bag. So I decided to hitchhike across the country after I got a flat (I didn't have a spare tube or even a wrench as I left spur of the moment)


I got stuck in Reno, so I train-hopped on a particularly cold day, and decided after the traine suddenly veered north away from any sign of civilization to either jump off and walk to my death, jump into the wheels, or stay on through the night and freeze to death on the train, the wind-chill and my lack of clothing would've done the job.


I chickened out on all those options because 1) I also had it in my mind to either restart my life in Salt Lake City or visit Washington, DC and be in Time's Square by New Year's and 2) because when I was about to jump into the wheels, I dissociated in a frightening way in which for a moment it felt as if I was spending an eternity in a purgatory made of the deafening sound of the airconditioning unit above me, the speeding train, and the frigid blasts of wind. As I later learned the back of my ankle, some toes on my foot, and my ring fingers were developing frost nip."

madprudentilla,dogs,1390514771.0,"My mistake, poorly worded.  I meant to out myself a spay/neuter zealot, but I personally haven't taken anyone aside for their dog still having its balls.  It's rude and you're right that it's really none of my business-- but I have seen it happen pretty frequently at the bark park I take Tatum to.  It's the bay area, after all, and everyone has an opinion (myself included).

You're also absolutely correct that there are legitimate reasons not to spay/neuter, however I don't think the study you linked makes a good case for that.  Correlation ≠ causation.  A better example: My best friend's boxer had a myriad of issues, including hemophilia.  Additionally, his testicles never descended.  The risk for him was just too high and as a result he was never neutered.  

Regarding the study you cited, to my knowledge hip dysplasia can be caused by environmental hereditary factors but (at least according to Tatum's vets) it's largely genetic.  Lymphosarcoma (which has an incidence of about .07% with some breeds being more susceptible) and hemangiosarcoma (with an incidence of about 2% ) also have strong genetic factors.  While the data is pretty compelling, I'd question whether some of the it is a bit misleading (for example ""The percentage of HSA cases in late-neutered females [about 8 percent] was 4 times more than intact and early-neutered females,"" which would suggest that late-neutering is bad; whereas ""There were no cases of CCL diagnosed in intact males or females, but in early-neutered males and females the occurrences were 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively"" suggests that late-neutering is bad).  Further, the study was partially funded by the AKC's Canine Health Foundation, which has come under a lot of fire for not actually promoting canine health, most notably by Temple Grandin in *Animals in Translation* (which I HIGHLY recommend to anyone).  The AKC has a very powerful lobby and is constantly fighting spay/neuter, tethering/penning, and cropping/docking restrictions.  With the AKC's agenda and their funding behind this study I think any reasonable person might find the findings highly suspect, especially because there are so many studies funded by any number of different organizations which extoll the virtues of spaying and neutering, most often longevity.  From the same website, and ironically also funded by the AKC:

http://www.vin.com/apputil/image/handler.ashx?docid=5800951

Likewise, spaying and neutering has been found to reduce all kinds of other issues including cancer in dogs:  Mammary tumors, Pyometria (which occurs in 25% of intact females), Ovarian and Uteran tumors (although those are more rare), testicular cancer (with an incidence of about 13% if the dog lives to be 10), prostate enlargement (although some studies have found a higher incidence of prostate cancer in neutered dogs, but, again, breed predisposition suggests that genetic factors play a role).

I could nitpick all day, but for me the issue at hand is the sheer number of homeless dogs out there, and the assholes who breed them irresponsibly to make a buck.  It's sickening and the dogs deserve better.

My point still stands: leave it to the professionals.  I strongly believe that until we get overpopulation in check, we should continue to encourage spaying and neutering whenever possible, and that the only people who should be breeding are responsible, legitimate breeders. If there weren't millions of unwanted dogs and cats in the US, I'd happily get mine from a breeder."

frackaracka,worldnews,1390514787.0,"&gt; I feel like Indians who left a decade or two ago live in a state of cultural incubation- a belief that adapting to Western cultures is somewhow betraying their own, while those back in India are presented with western culture so seamlessly by the media that they assimilate it quite well

You are correct about the cultural incubation that our parents go through, but I think you are mistaken about the ""seamless"" integration of Western culture with Indian media. 99.9% of what the Indian media portrays Western culture to be is a caricature. I'm sure you've experienced some of the difference between the caricature and the reality since you studied here.

&gt; The female foeticide issue is absolutely disgusting, and needs to be severely dealt with. But I feel that many posts like this absolutely undermine the current Indian generations' fight in overcoming a cultural confusion and are very dismissive of any change.

I'm actually very surprised at the changes India is going through. When we last visited, my parents and I were shocked to see local developments that we frankly didn't expect India to have. And I'm encouraged that it is no longer taboo to talk about rape and sexual violence. These are conversations that India needs to have.

But, I think that it may be difficult for resident Indians to understand just how much change there needs to be in order to really overhaul entrenched cultural attitudes - not just socially, but economically as well. From an outsider's perspective, the infrastructure is just not there yet. But I'm optimistic that India will get there eventually."

You could do any kind of pasta with jarred sauce.... You could just boil water then cook pasta then mix in sauce. Or boil water then cook pasta then add sauce, top with cheese, and bake.

But I recommend this recipe for simple butter pasta:

1 lb angel hair pasta 
1/2 stick of butter
1/2 an onion
2 cloves garlic (if peeling and chopping garlic is too difficult for them, you can skip it)

Boil water. Then cook pasta according to box (about 4 min.).
Meanwhile, chop onions and melt butter in pan. Cook onions in butter until translucent. (Here you can add garlic or any herbs you want) Season with S&amp;P. Toss cooked pasta in sauce. Serve.

I would also say since you're doing boiled water, try poaching an egg.

A simple shrimp or chicken taco could be good too:

Cook shrimp or chicken in olive oil with S&amp;P. Warm up tortillas to soften. You could buy salsa or have them make their own - there are a million recipes, and that could be good practice for knife skills."

Instead, YOU have to fix it yourself. You have to develop more confidence, get over the past, and fake it til you make it. Sending a letter like this is just going to make your boyfriend feel put upon and emotionally manipulated, in my opinion."

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1390515053.0,"Pretty poster design. I like the way you captured the 'GRAVITY' lettering at the bottom. I also liked the solidity of the statue - the clean, carved details. While the background isn't anything special, I do think you made the right decision in terms of composition, in using a very simple backdrop to bring all the attention to your statue.

Just a couple things to note about the statue, though. Most importantly, you need to vary your hues more. Right now, since you're mostly sticking to the same range of hues for the entire statue, it ends up looking somewhat flat. The same can be said of your use of saturation. Try using more saturated tones in your shadows, and also exploring cooler colours in the shadow areas (since your lighter areas tend towards warmer tones). Don't push the saturation too much though, since it is stone after all.

One last note - the hand stands out, because the  values are quite a bit lighter than the rest of the statue. Usually this is a good way to achieve a sense of depth, but in this case, it instead gives the illusion of the hand being an entirely separate entity from the rest of the statue. Also, when painting fingers, be aware that the larger section of the fingers are actually the joints - the common misconception that you've depicted often results in sausage-fingers.

Keep up the good work! The attention to detail you've shown on the statue, and the cleanliness of your rendering will definitely take you far. At the same time, don't be afraid to experiment more, and play with your colours."

Wiskie,CFB,1390515137.0,"Minnesota vs. Iowa is tough.

**Minnesota** is a blue state in red state territory. Wisconsin is kinda divided, but technically red for the time-being. Politics aside: Minnesotans consider themselves to be very high-cultured and it kind of annoys the shit out of me. I call them Canada-lite for this reason. Not only are they closer to Canada, but they're also probably more similar to Canada culturally than maybe any other State. It seems more tame up there. Objectively speaking, it's not a bad thing, but when you're the butt of their jokes it gets annoying, and that Minnesotans (especially those from the civilized Twin Cities) consider cheeseheads to be rednecks is a very common trope.

But Wisconsin and Minnesota are pretty similar (more similar to each other than they are to any other states) in the sense that they are mostly inhabited by the descendants of Germans and Scandinavians + some British Isles folk with very little else. We look similar, our accents are similar, our traditions are similar etc. Also, because of reciprocity, a lot of Minny folk go here for school and the other way around. Reminds me of the Geats vs. Swedes from Beowulf or some shiz.

I would say that, because they're so similar in some ways but different in others, I hate Minnesota more than anyone else.

**Iowa**, I hate them too, but who really knows what goes on in that state. It's flatland and corn. Anything they tell you about being ""nice"" is a joke. Iowans were never nice to me, but maybe I got a bad sample.

I think many Wisconsinites especially dislike Chicagoans in the classic city-slicker vs. rural folk sense, but there's not really a team in the B1G that has come to represent Chicago. In fact, the team that most represents that ""bad"" things about Chicago is probably Notre Dame. lol"

Roland_Moorweed,adventuretime,1390515178.0," First and must of all: mathematical! The episode started off strong with a good and fanciful horde fight scene! Bravo. Unfortunately for our adored hero, Finn is outmatched due to a lack of ""edge"". I really enjoyed the way the writing played with the realization of Finn's connection with the demon-blood sword and morphed into a tale of acceptance. Since the previous blade was created by his father, Finn has had a strong paternal link with the item. especially seen early in the episode in which he is cradling it through the market. His excitement after receiving the new weapon is genuinely natural (coupled with the poor decisions often seen to accompany their behavior) and I liked how it was designed like something from a phenomenal childhood dream. The battle with the Grass Wizard was enjoyably, typical Finn and Jake as well. He learned in the end that dealing with an issue (instead of throwing it into a river) that sometimes seems impossible, given a little meditation, allows you to truly master it. I love the newest member of Adventure Time's arsenal! The Grass Sword really is a great new addition to Finn's life as of late. After all, it is flammable!"

Hipsters belong to this counter-culture in that they are taking things that are purposely out of fashion or nerdy, or esoteric in nature and combining them in a fashion ensemble that, while being an assemblage of uncool items, it actually qualifies as cool as a whole. The old glasses, graphic t's and things that are so-uncool-theyre-cool actually have fashion value in this culture and worn traditionally, as if trying to be fashioanble, would not be cool but when worn ironically, as part of an inside joke, they make the wearer cool.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390515238.0,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_history_of_the_United_States

&gt;The history of taxation in the United States begins with the colonial protest against British taxation policy in the 1760s, leading to the American revolution. The independent nation collected taxes on imports (""tariffs""), whiskey, and (for a while) on glass windows. States and localities collected poll taxes on voters and property taxes on land and commercial buildings. There are state and federal excise taxes. State and federal inheritance taxes began after 1900, while the states (but not the federal government) began collecting sales taxes in the 1930s. The United States imposed income taxes briefly during the Civil War and the 1890s, and on a permanent basis from 1913. There have been no export taxes, taxes on trade between states, or taxes on charities and religious bodies, and no value added tax."

If your son had said 'because I want you to be around when I have children of my own' then I think he would have had a valid point.

Personally I think that body type is not a good way to consciously judge potential mates and shouldn't be considered a rational factor (Sure we have initial sexual preferences, but in my experience love doesn't care about that.)  The idea that she would suddenly be undesirable if she lost weight is just as bad as the reverse.

If you enjoy someone's company, you shouldn't care if they were large or a skeleton, asides of course being concerned for their health."
CC-Rider,Music,1390515771.0,"Here are some others that might help.

**[Faure - Pie Jesus from Requiem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VLY2bd5w8k)**

Requiems are written for deaths, essentially. Faure's requiem is a delicate, intimate affair with a small ensemble. This Pie Jesus is among the most beautiful ever written. Just sublime.

**[Erik Satie - Gymnopedie No. 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU)**

Charming little piano miniature that you might enjoy and likely have heard before.

**[Chopin - Nocturne No. 1 in Bb Minor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVfZfS-Cw7k)**

Beautiful, calming piece; very evocative of the night.

**[Ravel - Suite 2 from Daphnis et Chloe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amGl9Qmgu7E)**

Just a sublime soundscape that blossoms forth from a gorgeous texture. Ravel makes magic happen with instrumentation.

**[Mozart - Sonata in F, Adagio K280](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K3VLrOjIXU)**

So this isn't French like the others, and it also is from a lot earlier, but it is beautiful and delicate and wonderful. I suggest giving it a shot. Sometimes people new to classical will find Mozart boring but I find this piece to be heavenly."

But we're not even really talking about the scenario of ""Hey, Suzie, heard you got raped, and I meant to tell you that's a bad part of town, so you should never go there again because it's pretty rapey over there"" so much as we're talking about this one: ""Hey, Suzie, I know you want to go to that bar, but that's a sketchy side of town so maybe bring some friends, preferably intimidating-looking ones.""  One is much closer to victim-blaming than the other.

Giving someone instructions on how to prevent being a victim in the first place (so these are non-victims we're instructing here) is not the same as saying ""I told you so"" to an actual victim of rape.  Equating them is just a weak way to argue.  I don't want to hear your advice after I've gotten raped - obviously - but I might find it useful if rape is something I want to avoid forever."

lendrick,SocialEngineering,1390515980.0,"I wouldn't call this *particularly* dishonest (he didn't lie to anyone), but the article itself would appear to indicate that he went about OkCupid the wrong way.

I'm a nerdy guy and I don't think of myself as particularly attractive (the dude in the article is definitely better looking than I am), but I did really well on OkCupid (I'm happily married now to a girl I met there).  All I did was decide to be honest in my profile.  The problem with most dating profiles is that they're dull, and when a profile is dull, it means that either the person is a boring person, or they're not confident enough about their life to be willing to reveal it.  Either way, that doesn't make for great relationship material.

Anyway, right up front I said that I'm a nerd.  I mentioned that at the time I played World of Warcraft seriously three evenings a week.  I said I liked Dungeons &amp; Dragons and anime.

A lot of people try to ""optimize"" their profiles so that they get an initial message or a first date.  Frankly, messages and first dates mean jack shit.  Not only does an honest profile attract people with the same interests as you, it filters out people who would be a waste of your time.  If a girl looks down her nose at guys who play D&amp;D, why would I want a relationship with her?  That's a recipe for misery.  How many people saw that I played WoW seriously and tossed my profile into the garbage?  Probably a lot.  But I'm fine with that.

I got way less first messages and dates than this guy did, but I got 2 second dates (to his four) and a long term relationship (I'm married to one of them, and good friends with the other), and I did it in half the time, *and* I didn't waste a ton of time and money on 80 failed dates.  Furthermore, if you read the bit at the end of the article:

&gt; When she confessed that she’d made some tweaks to her profile before messaging him, he responded by telling her all about his love hacking. The whole story.

*Honesty* is what made him interesting.  It's telling that the one it worked out with was the one he decided to let in on his big plan.

So I wouldn't call this a social engineering success.  An interesting experiment, absolutely.  Definitely worth a read.  But it wasn't the experiment itself that succeeded.  He only ended up with a girl because for that one date he sacrificed the experiment and was honest and interesting.  If anything, though, this is a story about where social engineering really *didn't* work.

Sometimes the best way to interact with people is to just interact with them as yourself and not treat it like a game or a social experiment."

mrcleanup,atheism,1390515985.0,"&gt;I had betrayed her, we had no chance of a life together now since I can't be an alpha-Christian leader and head-of-household, and that we would probably have to get a divorce.

What is clear to me from this is that she did what a lot of people do, she constructed a fantasy of how things would be when she grew up, and then set about gathering the things she needed to live it out, you being one of them.

Now that her fantasy is threatened, she seeks to protect it, and she has stated pretty clearly that the fantasy might just be more important than you are. Clearly, we all need time to adjust when we realize that life is not the way that we hoped it would be. Generally anger is followed by grief, etc until we reach acceptance.

First things first, I would be sure that you represent yourself truthfully so she gets the message clearly that this is how you really are, and not just something you were toying with. Then she needs time to accept the situation. Who can say what she will do, but ultimately, if she leaves you over this, than she loves her fantasy more than you ,and though it my hurt now, you may be better off in the long run. Clearly, you are only welcome her as long as you support *her* vision of things, this doesn't seem to be a partnership or a negotiation. You are just an accessory here the way things are now. 

If she has time to think and accept and adjust, will that change? I don't know.But I do know that we all have to be true to who we really are, and that pretending we are different to keep someone else happen will always cause more misery in the end. (It took a divorce for me to learn that.)

MrDubious,TrueReddit,1390516041.0,"&gt;if 'THEY' covertly intercept the glass images and sound its gonna be a whole lot more useful information.

Are you assuming Glass is just constantly filming all the time? Because it's not. There's nothing for ""them"" to intercept. Think about it:

 - If you do nothing but record video, you take the battery life from six hours to about 50 minutes. Seriously. 

 - If you're not connected to Wifi, the device is paired via Bluetooth to your 4G enabled device. How long do you think it takes to stream uncompressed 720P video via a 4G connection? (Join a Google Hangout from your phone, and you'll get the answer: fucking forever). 

 - Glass is off more than it is on, and any time any action occurs on the timeline, there are multiple indicators, not the least of which is turning on the screen. 

 - Phones are often out and about, either being held in hand, set on a table, etc. 

I'm not going to the extreme when I suggest that most of the speculative use cases just don't match up with the device usage in real life.

&gt; How many messages do you get per day on average?

When you first join, you are featured in ""the rotation"". The result is dozens at the beginning. The longer you are on the site, the less you are ""in rotation"" or featured and it trickles to 1 every few days. It also depends how active you are on the site. The more you give, the more you get. If you are messaging guys, you will be featured more and probably get more messages.

&gt; How many of them are some version of 'hey' or 'how's it goin'?

80%

&gt; Do you respond to those messages? Or do you find them distasteful or offensive?

I didn't respond. I wasn't offended. It just seemed fairly obvious to me they didn't read anything I wrote. 

&gt; Do you respond to long messages that reference your profile or do you think they are signs of desperation?

Yes. The guys that took the time to read my profile and comment on it are the ones who are worth going on a date with, in my experience.

&gt; How often do you write to a guy first, and what is your strategy?

Rarely, but I should have more. I was just lazy.

&gt; Do you think a guy who has obvious 'status symbols' in his profile pictures are more attractive? Like being surrounded by lots of girls or pictures of their cars.

Huge turn-off. I noticed I like a good solo photo, a photo of them ""doing something"" (hobby they may have) and then a photo with them in a group setting (evidence they have friends).

RazTehWaz,Trophies,1390516210.0,"I have a decent amount of plats (36), but also a lot of games at 0%. I pick up a game when I see it at a decent price and think I'll like it. Every game gets a trial and if I am really enjoying the first hour or so then I'll probably plat it eventually.

If I hated the game I'll stop playing, normally my boyfriend will end up playing it on his own account so it's not wasted money to me. There are just too many good games to waste time playing ones I'm not enjoying.

The games I've platted tend to be on the easier end of the scale, simply because I used to hate repeating sections of the game - if it was too hard I'd just rage quit and never go back. 

I stopped playing for a year as my depression got really bad and I just had no motivation to do anything. The PS4 released just as I was on an upswing and helped me get back into it and I've been having a blast since launch day. My gaming choices have changed a lot now though; I really enjoy a challenge, and that awesome feeling when you beat something that you really struggled with. My first PS4 Plat was Knack, and it took me 2 weeks of daily play, along with 5 full playthroughs to get my platinum but I did it! I'm so proud of it, more than any other plat I have.

Next was Lego Marvel, and while the main game was easy, those flying time trials were great fun to master. I'm now working on sound shapes, and while the mini games are kicking my ass so hard, I'm just loving the feeling I get after spending 2 hours learning to master it and finally getting that last note. 5 Death Mode levels to go!"

Shibboleths,AskReddit,1390516410.0,"If you like guys who have a good amount of jokes, little downtime, and aren't afraid to make up silly shit: I thought Kevin Nealon's recent one on there was pretty great.

If you like more life-experience/storytellers: Marc Maron's *Thinky Pains* wasn't bad. I think some of his other stuff is getting him a good amount of traction on there. Hell, I saw a book of his at the bookstore last week. Otherwise, I personally didn't think Mike Birbiglia's *My Girlfriend's Boyfriend* structure didn't work as well as it could have - with how it kept delving deeper and deeper into frames before coming back out - [but I meant to say it's worth a shot]

If you like personality: Kevin Hart has been obviously making a good name for himself. Aziz Ansari has some really great writing, but sometimes his presentation isn't as funny as the ideas for me. His jokes about ghosts in *Buried Alive* still makes me crack up like 2 months later, though.

If you like unusual shit: Bo Burnham's *What* is clever (albeit made me wonder why I bothered watching for the really great parts at some awkward points) to watch with people who don't know who he is already and who are older than maybe 24. 

I'm a sucker for Louis C.K. in general, but that opinion is just one in a landslide here and one that can be set aside unless you've never actually watched him.

Champions are design with poorer or stronger early game, offset with a better or weaker late game. If a strategy that hurts early-game dominant champions too much, then it reduces the amount of viable picks.

bobbyg27,ForeverAlone,1390516577.0,"&gt; I would not even know how. My mind is very objective focused. If I want to get a coffee then I just want the coffee. If I want to play a game with people then I want to focus on that game.

OK, to make it an objective, talk to random women, and ask them questions about themselves. At some point (and this can be after a few small interactions) your objective will be to say something relevant to their interests or hobbies or history that would be either interesting or amusing, but also completely unobtrusive (meaning not asking to do something). Your goal should be to simply amuse them a little bit and your expectations should be 0 gain or reward for you, beyond maybe a smile just to be polite (hey better than nothing).

And yeah, you will fail a few times at first, say a tiny little joke that completely flops, or heck maybe even comes off weird and off putting. Oh well... take that learning of what didn't go well (maybe you were too specific, remembered something that gave you away as trying very hard to be interesting, etc) and keep it in mind for next time.

I think regardless of how anyone looks, and even some ticks and potentially unusual mannerisms, everyone likes someone who is friendly, unassuming, and polite.  It's easy to fall into that role once you know how to get there (see above), and during that time you are getting excellent experience talking to the other gender. Again, don't expect anything to come of it; no dates, no winks, she might forget your name long after you've remembered hers... expect nothing more than some smiles, maybe some token laughter, and a relationship that will probably go no further than a ""recognized acquaintance."" But the best thing about that, for this purpose, is that lack of expectation will come through and will make women even more open to just being polite to each other.  When they suspect ""oh man, this guy probably wants to ask me out, and it'll be awkward because I will say no..."" their guard is up... but being unassuming will bring that guard down rather quickly and you can actually have real conversations.  That's your target.

Maybe it's just me but I think it sounds like a fun project."

If she doesn't leave, you will have to evict her, which means you have to go through the courts. If you put her out like you're saying you're going to, you will fuck yourself and she will be entitled to damages. If you put her out and there is damage done to her possessions, you will be liable for that too. The only way you can physically remove her from the property is if you go to court and there is a judgement in your favor. Then the sheriff will come out while its being done. You absolutely, positively cannot just throw someones property out in the street if they don't leave after their lease is up.

I might suggest moving up just one tile to the north west, which gives you a best of both worlds: No turn loss, and closer to the hills on the near term."

OH, and protip: contrary to conventional wisdom, it's easier to size a ring up than it is to size it down.  Sizing down actually makes the prongs looser on the stones, so especially if you've got a lot of small stones on the band, sizing down is a big no-no.  Many people think it's better to guess big and size down for vanity reasons, but if you are at all concerned about the structural integrity of the ring, sizing up is much, much better.

Ah, here's how I'd do it, if I was getting a sneaky finger size: get down on one knee with a twist-tie, the paper kind with the metal center.  Twist it around her finger.  Don't let her squash it or throw it out.  Melodramatically insist that she keep it forever.  Snatch it later."

Best thing to do after that is for land based vehicles spend about 10-15 minutes in test range and learn turning radius and how fast your rounds will travel. For air based vehicles i would spend a good half hour learning to fly each one as air vehicle warfare does require a good bit of skill. But overall i would find a setup for each vehicle that you like and gets the job done and stick with it. I found if you change your weapons and abilities on your vehicles you will lose a familiarity and will struggle more compared to if you stick with one set up you will know your limitations.

* Initial ""essentials"" shop. Flour, spices, sugar, etc. The first shop really adds up.
* Storage. I keep buying shelves.

You realize that you can't just say something and that makes it true, correct?  I could say that Ted Bundy didn't kill people, but it wouldn't make it any less true.  TRP has proven TIME AND TIME again that they hate women due to an abundance of posts completely trashing them.  All posts and comments are literally dedicated to the degradation, subjugation, and/or hatred of women.  *This is not up for debate*.  Some TRPers will even openly admit that they hate women.

This proves that you are in fact NOT for equality, since feminism is a movement that fights for equal rights and to raise women's place in society to that of men.

&gt; you women want to dominate over men which I am not okay with.

Nope, not true.  It's in fact you TRPers that are upset that women are now your equals...you wish to return to a time when you could dominate over them.  In fact...that's what you hateful piece of shits look for...women you can dominate.

FactualPedanticReply,legaladvice,1390517342.0,"and you're putting words in mine, but I guess turnabout is fair play.

I'm not saying that *all* professors get into teaching for power trips - that's absurd and very unfair to the many wonderful teachers I've had in my life. I'm saying that the ones who get their panties in a knot about some students sometimes not paying attention in lecture are doing so for egocentric reasons that they, themselves, probably don't realize. Professorship is a position of a certain kind of authority, and, like any position of authority, it has perils. First, it will tend to draw a certain type of unrepentant, self-important person, but, like most positions of authority, the majority of people drawn to it won't be that type. 

Second, even people who are only self-centered to a normal extent will still have their worldview shaped over time by their perceived importance or authority. We all know that's a lie, though - authority is something that is ultimately given, not taken. If you know a lot about something or have an unusual skill, that only results in special status for you if other people decide you have merit for that. It's easy over time to lose track of where those boundaries are if you're not a naturally calculating, introspective person; this is where situational Evil comes from. One can, over time, develop a sense of entitlement to authority and control and lose sight of the fact these are things that need to be continuously ceded to one, not given once and for all time.

Higher education isn't liturgical; it's a business. The students are the customers. Most of the undergraduates are not going to go on to the vaunted halls of graduate school. They pay money to have a teacher lecture them. What the student chooses to do with the experience they've paid for is their business as long as they don't negatively affect other students' ability to take advantage of the service. If I pay for a movie, go into the theater, and have a loud conversation on my phone, that's rude. If I go into a theater and quietly sleep through the movie, whose business is that but mine? 

It's a grave error to be more committed to teaching a grown adult than that adult is committed to learning. If they're not interested, it is absolutely not the teacher's job to try to force them to act interested. This is what I'm talking about when I talk about mutual respect. If you're teaching and one of your students' attention is somewhere nonproductive, you may not approve of that decision, but you must respect it. The student is an adult with free will and full agency in this world; it's not the teacher's job to try and parent them into ""good decisions.""

Moreover, the judgment that what the student is doing on their phone or computer is ""non-productive"" is wholly based on what that student is trying to achieve. If achieving a high grade and learning a lot is the student's goal, lecture time is probably best spent paying attention to the lecturer. If the student's goals are elsewhere, they might be best achieved by doing something on a cell phone or computer. Again, it is absolutely not the teacher's job to set the student's life priorities. It's the teacher's job to present class material to those who want to learn it in as orderly an environment as they can manage.

Frankly, I think that, if you're just going to derp around on your phone, you might as well not be in class, but it's neither my job nor the teacher's job to try and enforce that opinion on an adult who's interfering with no one."

Such a definition is attractive to the male mind because it has measurable elements (and men love measuring shit), **but the attitude behind it panders to the female imperative**, and grants female priorities as having precedence over male ones.

That right there is the whole cause of modern-day strife between the sexes.

That's why the Red Pill movement espouses a new definition of strength. **Your integrity to yourself is the true measure of your strength.**

No more rolling over, fetching the stick, and sitting at the command of women who will take your efforts to be cheap tricks for dog treats. Now, your work, your sweat, your blood, and your sacrifice matter, and people had best recognize and respect if they desire even a morsel of it.

A woman has two options:

1. She can attach herself to a strong man who does what seems right to him, and she can enjoy the ancillary benefit of her association with him.
2. She can attach herself to a weak man who's efforts and sacrifices are just a tithe to her, and be unsatisfied by his lack of masculinity.

I was part of the audience but we weren't sitting still, we had the freedom to roam the different rooms and interact with the scenes. We had masks and the only rules were 1) don't remove your mask 2) don't speak.

The effects were mind-bogglingly powerful. I felt free to do just about anything. Of course I didn't overstep my bounds and disturbed the actors, but I was very compelled to do so. I don't know if there's any word for this sensation but it was very powerful. Full freedom. No accountability. The experience made me feel like an entirely different person for two hours.

If you agree with me that there is a natural tendency to be ""spiritual"", then you have to agree that without any form of external influence (*such as but not including* religion), the definition for ""God"" is moot. Hell, the definition for ""spirituality"" becomes completely undefined.

Lack of definition is what drives surveys like this. You've got a large population of people who basically don't have any religious influence being asked if they believe in the classical definition of ""God"", a definition that was basically created *by* religions. 

You can sit around all day claiming that because they said they don't believe in ""God"" means that they aren't religious or spiritual or chose to believe in reason and science, but the reality is that this is likely one giant mis-communication."

amaefm,worldnews,1390518098.0,"Oh I certainly understand, this entire situation is being viewed through a skewed lens.  Everyone has automatically sided with the protestors and is acting like Yanukovych willfully severed ties with the EU when some descriptions I've seen make it look like Yanukovych was screwed either way. 

The one assessment of the situation said that the EU plan offered to Yanukovych would have cost Ukraine 150 billion dollars to implement while also damaging their relations with Russia to the point where their energy prices would skyrocket and also Russian trade would substantially diminish. Also, Putin offered Ukraine something like 15 billion(iirc) if the deal was not accepted and after Yanukovych did reject it the Russian energy company cut their rates in half.

If this is accurate, how on earth could the man have accepted a deal that would cost an incredible amount of money and possibly cripple the Ukrainian economy when the other side offered to give mone?

All that being said however, the government response to these protests certainly seem heavy handed and the Orwellian re-writing of protest/speech law is completely unacceptable.  I don't think there is a situation that makes it okay to turn fire hoses on civilians in below freezing temperatures or tell everyone in a given area who has a cell phone that they are now enemies of the state just by being there.  No, that's certainly not okay and that's why the actions of these government enforcers come into question.

The intent behind his words are more to the former.

I mean, this passage was written before dishwashers, washers, dryers, vacuums, etc. Things were different back then. It might seem outdated now and things have definitely changed, but the Christian men I know are asking their wives for input on big decisions and not just acting.

You repeatedly deny private motivation for enterprise or technology. Or you have backslid somehow to allowing it now but that it's not enough for you. At this point I don't know what else to say. I assume you don't agree that your premises are illogical, otherwise you wouldn't see it that way. So I guess we're toast.

Gee, two insults from two people assuming I'm too idiotic to understand or something. I'm not too dumb to understand, I understand all too well. Capitalism is built on the concept of self interest. As a result, those who have more throw their weight around and put those who having nothing in a worse and worse position. Conservatives and libertarians are so scared of government dependence they forget that they're often dependent on some self interested rich guy who cares only about what profit you make them.

Everything about them and the other characters was extremely reserved and stiff- when it should have been big and broad and fluid. There was no reason to limit the motion this way. The designs were also, largely, uninspired and flat. It was all in that generic, harsh-lined flash style that marks a beginner.

I haven't read the books, but at least in the second movie when the 75th games got interrupted, it was quite evident that the whole arena is covered with some sort of rigging besides the force field -- which also requires generators and other equipment, by the way. The Capital wants full control of everything, so presumably there would have been a similar arena every time, no matter where it's built. Just the raw materials for such a massive structure would cost millions, although obviously they get them for free from the districts."

AssaultKommando,xxfitness,1390518486.0,"One tip that I found useful for tolerating cardio was getting into an enjoyable sport with a significant cardio component. Could be touch rugby, ultimate frisbee, kickboxing or football, it doesn't matter much.

While strength training alone will put you in pretty good shape for general health, unless you're doing loads of kettlebell work, circuits and barbell complexes it probably won't ever be enough for your liking if a good part of your spare time involves running at or past people. 

Programs that crop up later in your training progression might also tax your cardio pretty severely. Bodybuilding-style splits are notable for having short rest periods and squeezing out the last bits of your linear progression requires a DC 30 Will check."

3kool5you,nfl,1390518497.0,"This was my theory as well. Everything had been going to plan so far and now it was time for Wes to do his part. He would run the wrong route late in the AFC championship game , which would give Talib a pick-six and clinch the game for New England. The game was just starting, Peyton gave Wes a look, ""ready for a good game? Just do your best out there we got this"" and he smiled that cute manning smile. Wes looked over to the patriots sideline and locked eyes with Brady, who gave him the ""you know what to do"" look. 

Wes was torn, did he have the will to go against the dark lord, NO-he had to carry out his wishes. But Peyton, all Peyton had done for him how could he betray him like this... Wes knew what had to be done. He set his eyes on Talib  and the play was executed, he hit him with all the strength of a ~~small white receiver~~scrappy gym rat and took Aqib out The plan was broken, Welker knew what he had done. Brady was shocked, Bill was even moreso, some say several of welker's family members and loved ones had gone ""missing"" after the game, but no one knows for sure."

balathustrius,mead,1390518510.0,"It depends on your palette.

Some general guidelines:

dry to off dry: 0.990 - 1.010

semi-sweet to medium sweet: 1.010 - 1.025

sweet - dessert: 1.025 - 1.040+

In six gallons of mead, a pound of sugar will add about .005 gravity points per pound. So if you're at 1.000 and add two pounds, you can expect a new gravity of around 1.010.

You can take a hydrometer sample and sweeten it until it reaches a sweetness that seems right to you. Take a new hydrometer reading and then add honey accordingly. I tend to add the honey in steps, taking samples between, to make sure I'm getting the expected results.

SirIngenious,nfl,1390518589.0,"I read somewhere that the Bengals had the misfortune to face and lost to very great Texans defenses during previous playoffs. And this past season marked the misfortune of Dalton playing bad at the wrong time. Just like when Luck threw those 4 INTs against NE. Or when Indy faced the SB winning team in Baltimore Ravens. Mistakes aside, they're still good players. 

Once again, I think Dalton is a good player (just like Flacco, Romo, Cutler, etc), but fans give average QBs a lot of flack these days because they expect these guys to be PFM. When Luck threw 19 INTs during his rookie year, people (even some Colts fans) were wondering if the Irsay and Grigson made the mistake of releasing PFM to draft Luck. No, of course not but Luck isn't going to be PFM and he will never be. Just like any other QBs not named PFM. 

Really, I think the Bengals would make a grave error in releasing Dalton. I think they should just lock him up and throw a lot of $$$ his way. Just establish a favorable system for Dalton to thrive in. "

codayus,BDSMcommunity,1390518816.0,"Collars as a physical item are ""reserved"" for anyone who feels like wearing one.  Subs, slaves, doms, people into the goth look, actual dogs...  :)

Collars **as a status** are for slaves and the more serious type of submissive, highly analogous to engagement or marriage.  Not every sub will end up collared, or even wants to be.  ""Being collared"" is an important step, and an actual physical collar might be involved.  Then again, many collars are mental or symbolic.  Many ""collared submissives"" use a bracelet, for example.

For a normal D/s relationship, many interactions, including many sexual interactions, will be perfectly vanilla.  For a 24/7 D/s relationship it's more complicated; D/s is part of everything you do, including the ""vanilla"" sex or even going to the grocery store.  But it's all mental; an outsider watching you would have no idea.

Humiliation is not a super-common part of BDSM, and no element of BDSM is inevitable.  Certainly not humiliation!

Pet is a very common ""pet name"".  :)

Qualities of a good dominant would be:  Confidence, consistency, trustworthiness.  Say what you mean, mean what you say, and be as dependable as a rock.  Care about your partners.  Understand that a submissive is every bit as valuable and important as the dominant; just different.

I started to become aware of my dominant tendencies reading the Paladin of Shadows series by John Ringo.  Some of the subplots involve BDSM sex, and I found it *very* interesting.  :)  It took a while for me to fully internalize that this was potentially more than just a book plot, but once I did, I realized it was something I sorely needed."

Orelle,infj,1390518894.0,"I've shared a room with an INFP and a household with a somewhat introverted ESFP, simultaneously. I'm not basing this commentary on MBTI so much as my personal experience, but I hope it may still be enlightening. 

* The INFP and I both needed a significant amount of solitary indoor 'recharge' time, something we had to negotiate in our space. My recharge time was quieter and more contained than the INFP's, which often involved loud media or a lot of workspace, so we needed to pick different times. 
* The INFP and I were both creative night owls. The ESFP was typically a morning, daylight person. It was important to keep the noise down for each other, especially since the ESFP was unlikely to complain even if we'd disturbed them. 
* The ESFP was the least predictable member of the household in terms of daily schedule. They'd uphold all their obligations, but sometimes we worried when they didn't come home at the usual time — or for a day or two — and was completely incommunicado the entire time. To them, it was NBD! 
* I was more of a 'neat freak' than the INFP and the ESFP, although the ESFP was most reliable about performing chores, and the INFP most efficient. The INFP would leave stuff on the floor, and I hated that, while the ESFP simply didn't clean thoroughly enough for me. 
* The ESFP was the unsung hero of the household — I'm afraid we over-relied on them, because they automatically took care of things (including impressive cooking) to see us happy, but were slow to assert their own preferences with regard to the collective environment. Don't let that happen! 
* Communication problems: the INFP found my expressiveness and personal inquiries random and ""embarrassing,"" and I found myself pretending to like — but secretly irritated by — a number of their favorite conversation topics. I found both the INFP and ESFP coldly ""blunt"" with regard to sensitive topics, they found each other too insensitive, and the INFP and I were disappointed with the ESFP's lack of verbal communication, period. A little honesty goes a long way toward balancing these preferences out, and leaving each other notes was helpful. 
* Instead of being a conversationalist like the INFP and I, the ESFP was more interested in doing specific activities. So, if they wanted to share something with us, they wouldn't tell us much about it, they'd say, ""You have *got* to see/try this!"" Decline too many times, and their feelings will be hurt. So, don't make the ESFP listen to you all the time but never participate in their activities — that's you listening to them! The INFP was particularly out of their comfort zone in this regard, i.e. zero interest in athletics, so they weren't close. 

I could say more, but I'll stop there! Overall, it was a good experience and balanced out. I bonded with the ESFP and INFP separately, although they failed to bond with each other. I'd be happy to answer any questions!"

sovietterran,AdviceAnimals,1390519119.0,"My insurance was privately bought and the only reason I hit 3000 dollars is I ran back in for a followup right after the new year started and my deductibles reset. Now the cheapest things I can find in the aca database are more than 20 percent of my income or catastrophe only. Because of the red tape around financial help, my company's ACTUAL crap insurance, which isn't worth anything near the copay, and the fact that most of my choices are catastrophe only, make me ineligible for subsidies. Add to that the fact that I'm 23 and now you can't charge older people more than 300 percent more than younger people, and now my premiums are skyrocketing. Paying near 4000 dollars a year out of my 20k is not worth my time. The aca plans that are acceptable (save possibly 1 I'm looking into) are that or more. Is my employer perfect? No. Is american health insurance sometimes a giant load of bull? Yes. Is telling me it's their fault I'm now uninsured and that me losing my protection is somehow a positive aspect of the aca kind of analogous to telling me ""I got mine, go whine to someone else that now YOUR insurance is gone.""? It kind of feels like it, yeah. I grew up in a family where my dad couldn't get insurance because of his preexisting conditions. I KNOW something should have been done. I can and will take issue with shifting the burden to the younger generation who is financially screwed already. I can and will take issue with what crazy differences in coverage costs the ""zoning"" in the aca created. The people who are screwed by the aca may be a small group (we're not) but that wouldn't make us any less  important than the uninsured the aca was trying to help.  

Tl;Dr I'm sorry you don't like what my insurance was. I didn't really like it much either.  But the aca has not given me anything but worse options after taking away my safe guard against bankruptcy. I'd appreciate it if you just told me my concerns and problems do not matter to you in the light of Obamacare. Veiling it in advice on how my situation is better because I shouldn't have had the protection I did just kind of makes me feel dismissed. "

Soon my drinking transformed into sitting at home on nights I had no social plans. I would blackout at home, alone or with my roommate. I was so consumed in the binge that I didn't even realize the toll it took on me, I had just grown used to it.


Alcohol for the first time in my life was being detrimental to my life and health. Now I'm going 100 days sober, from there I plan on willfully exercising moderation. Limiting myself to drinking one night per week, with a 2 drink limit. If I fail my personal moderation test, I'm going back to no booze for another 100 days.

If you're going into student housing, don't be afraid to really throw yourself into the community that forms, but know when the draw the line when you need to study. If you're going into a share house, make sure the rules regarding visitors, cooking, cleaning, lights out, etc. are clearly known and have them written up so you can avoid some early arguments. 

Learn to use the library's resources, all of them. It's bloody invaluable, and good research skills is useful in ANY job. Love your library.

Food is expensive, if you can make your own sandwiches each day, it'll cost around $10-$15 for a week. Buying lunch everyday will hit $40-$50 per week, coffee uninclusive. Side note, spend week 1 (not O week) scouting the best coffee places if you're a caffeine fiend like me.

Making friends - start of your classes through week 1, sit down next to people, and introduce yourself before class starts, y'know, ""hi I'm XX, what's your name? is this your first year? I'm new too. I hope this lecturer isn't a total bore"" (bonding over terrible lecturers is always a thing). If you get talking, go have lunch together or something. Believe me, the more people you know in the classes you're taking, the easier that class is. I had a great first year, but then my double degree shunted me out of alignment with my single-degree friends, and I didn't make new friends in year 2 - that was my worst year at uni.

mrcleanup,atheism,1390519261.0,"One of the main underpinnings of atheism is the question of what foundational knowledge serves as the support for your beliefs. In the case of the Bible, either it is the inspired word of God and has been protected from corruption by his guiding hand, or it was once pure and has been corrupted, or it is just something some guys wrote.

If it is supposedly uncorrupted and it contradicts itself, a skeptic will always criticize that. If it was once pure and is now corrupted by age, edits and misinterpretation, then it could just as easily lead you astray as down the ""proper"" path. If it is just written buy some guys, there are a lot of books out there that advocate less violent and more respectful worldviews towards everyone. So the Bible as a foundational source, will never be sufficient here.

You would find more respect saying that you get your information directly from God. We might not be able to replicate that, and therefore not share your belief, and we might decide you are crazy, but we all believe different things and you are entitled to that, and we would at least be judging you based on your own beliefs and not contradictions in some book.

But when you assign yourself the label of ""Christian"" and that label is based on the teachings of the Bible. Then as far as we can see, you have built your house on a cracked foundation. And you can say that the crack doesn't matter, that we shouldn't worry about it, but we certainly aren't going to be getting any home building tips from you."

I've never been one to judge what a controller *looks* like, lol. 

It's a really good controller, but I doubt there are too many differences between the two (this is definitely a matter of opinion - lots of people say ""x controller is better"", but I doubt they have used both. I have yet to use an X1 controller so I can't say for sure which one I like the most). If I were you I'd just get the extra X1 game, as I imagine you can use the X1 controller on your PC as well.

Vordreller,polandball,1390519726.0,"&gt;Apparently he though freedom of religion actually meant freedom from religion.

It does.

Freedom of religion includes not believing in a creator and/or the organization that backs this. You can't be forced against your will to pick one or partake in one.

I see a bit lower in this thread, you said:

&gt;You can't really fully escape religion though

And that's not at all the same thing as not being forced to partake in it.

And it also depends on what you define as ""escaping religion"".

Some people include not wanting to see a woman in a burqa. To other people, that's not a problem. Other people don't want to discuss religions.

As far as I'm concerned, religion is something people should keep to themselves. They spend their free time the way they want, I'll spend mine the way I want. The moment you do something with your religion to influence the life of a person who does not follow your religion, you've gone too far.

As such, I don't agree with school only serving halal meat. The notion that people should just bring their own food if they don't like that, gives the religion preferential treatment.

And in a society where all are equal, that is not acceptable."

Quoting /u/nilhaus:

&gt; I wouldn't even know where to begin explaining how this flies in the face of the established lore. Nothing about this belongs in Middle Earth. From the implication that Ranger is some sort of class that Aragorn took levels in, or that Wraith is a race of people who just have a list of abilities you unlock, to the idiocy of the idea that people were toiling and farming in Mordor in between the books, it doesn't make any sense.

&gt;""QamDu' loD is a Klingon farmer toiling on the Borg home world trying to establish his moisture farm. This is set during the time period when the Borg home world wasn't quite a blasted environmental wasteland we think of, because they had just been beaten at the battle of Worf 359.

&gt;As he's harvesting moisture, a Borg raiding party ambushes his whole family and kills him, but somehow he doesn't die. He rises as a half Borg half Klingon half farmer, and uses his Borg powers to avenge his family. His battle cry is 'Perhaps today is a good day to assimilate!' He carries his son's broken phaser which he can use in combo attacks, and unlocks abilities like Borg mind control, and Borg teleportation.""

&gt;Does that sound cool? Well, kinda, but it also makes no sense in the world of Star Trek.

It might as well not be set in Middle-earth, but they're slapping on LotR's name on to it to make more money.

Samoyeds are intelligent, independent, rather difficult to train, literally shed full trash-bags of hair, and require constant (daily/every other day) grooming.  They're one family dogs.  They require an hour to three of daily physical exercise, and good amounts of mental stimulation or they get bored and start chewing things up.

When you speak to any breeder you're working with, they should go over this with you as well.

Things to keep in mind when you're selecting a breed (if you're dead-set on purebred):

* Your availability and living situation for the next 10-20 years
* Your willingness to give up being able to disappear for the weekend without a second thought.  You'll now have to care for your dog, or take it with you, which may cost more now that you have to find a hotel that accepts pets.
* The amount of work you're willing to put into grooming and training.  Dogs that are 'willing to please' are MUCH easier to train than independent ones.  All dogs shed, but two-coated (like Sammies) dogs shed quite a bit more
* What you want the dog to be to you.  A quiet companion? Someone who goes on outdoor adventures? Someone who snuggles a lot?

If you want to tell me more about your situation, I can give you breed suggestions.  Only if you want them, though. :)"

I made one particular mead that just blew away everyone that tasted it. It was an accident, but I was keeping good notes. It was an oaked habanero capsicumel. The accident was that the yeast gave up early at 1.015 (and this was EC-1118!), probably from under-nutrition, and produced some undesirable esters. The habanero and oak covered it up just enough, and I managed to strike just the perfect heat/sweet balance trying to save the batch.

3 lbs honey per gallon must (reserve around 5-7 oz if backsweetening)

1-2g  habanero per gallon must (1g is just a sliver)

1122 or 1116, rehydrated in go-ferm, use nutrients as usual.

Expected OG: ~1.108

Target FG: ~1.015

Habanero in primary, or secondary if you want a more peppery nose. Keep the pepper in for one month.

After stopping fermentation or backsweetening, let it sit for one month on ~15-18 medium toast french oak cubes.

Give another month for oak board flavor to dissipate. Bottle. Try not to drink it all at one go."

Basically, if you're applying enough friction or force to damage the glass, a slim sheet of plastic probably won't save it anyway. The other issue I see with screen protectors is that, because they're softer and therefore scratch more easily than glass, the phone ends up looking worse with a screen protector than without.

The steam engine was only capable because of advances in the two fields of smelting and precision machining.  Without those, you can't make a steam engine.  The metal is too week and doesn't fit together well enough to not tear it self apart.

Most people now days think of the steam engine as some clucky, imprecise motor.  Compared to today's engines, maybe, but you can't make them by hand.  You might be able to put one together by parts off the shelf, but no way can you make one with the tools available 2000 years ago.

Using it as a primary initate tool seems pretty weak in general because it doesn't really give that initiation power that other heroes like Puck (With slience and coil), or Tide with Ravage, or whatever.  If you don't even Thunderclap, it seems like a pretty shitty initiation.

Lost_in_redditland,IWantToLearn,1390520665.0,"No worries. I use Audacity(free software) to record myself. I started from sounding terrible while trying to sing rock to actually singing in a choir performance. My friends like to tease me since I am now in a choir and band at grad school. Never too late to start!

On the dancing front, I am not sure how to start. I have always loved dancing and have tried to practice at home (random videos) and think that flexibility and balance is important for me. I would love to learn ballroom dancing but I need to work on my own first. I did an afro-reggae dance workshop years ago and it was the happiest I felt dancing. Maybe I will try to start again.

Because if it is our current solar system and then a sudden appearance of another sun occurred, it would obviously a) not be our universe (things don't suddenly appear), and b) cause massive changes to the orbits.

But if the OP is asking how an Earth-like planet would evolve in a system in which there were two stars that are roughly 800 AU apart, that is a very different question. The effect of another moon's equivalent light on the Earth would be pretty negligible. But the orbit might be weird and it would potentially affect seasons by creating an irregular orbit."

I always paid attention to the acting, because I do LARPing and it's useful to see what professionals do. And Richard... he's something else entirely. He has this kind of presence that makes you aware of him even if he's not the focus of the scene, your eyes are just drawn to him, just in case. And he does a lot of work with his voice - you can *feel* the emotion in it, when Thorin says, ""I know these walls"" it's like he really is on the brink of crying. And watching him in interviews you realise Thorin's voice and manner of speaking is very different from his own (and so is Mr Thornton's, and John Porter's...), which is a big part of it, I think.

It's like, even if you catch a glimpse of him, entirely unaware, he's still Thorin, through and through. A lot of people I know don't pay attention to who the actor in here is, simply because they don't see him as an actor in a role. It's just Thorin."

Montuckian,startups,1390520778.0,"The conversion path is a little better. You're still going to get a lot of people exiting your conversion funnel before they see a way to contact you though.

You'll want your phone number to be front and center (and by that I mean on the top and to the right) and in text rather than an image.  You'll want your scheduler to be present on the schedule page and the contact page if possible.  Click to call is meh, and it's going to be useless in most cases as smartphones should pick up the text number.  At least disable it on full view screens (or find a theme that does this in the responsive CSS).

Beyond that, I'm really just not a huge fan of that theme, especially for what you're doing.  It could just as easily be a site for ball bearing delivery as it could for a cleaning service.  

The colors are drab and uninviting.  It may seem silly, but you're selling green cleaning services. Explore that motif with colors that will reinforce that.

The layout is boxy even though your icons are not.  The elements don't really work for the page, especially the side bar which is sitting there empty.

Text in the slider doesn't really work.  Two notes on that:

* If you're not going to use photos, don't use a slider.

* Use photos.

[Check here for some free ones you can use.](http://search.creativecommons.org/)

CSS animations are cool, but they should be used sparingly and for emphasis.  If everything is bold, bold doesn't mean anything anymore.

Anyway, that's my two cents plus some.

Here are a couple themes that I like better for what you're trying to do:

Okay, I lied.  Three other notes:

1. Make sure to put your Google Analytics code up.

2. Use Google Analytics

3. If you're going to blog, then blog.  If you're not, don't.  Yes google loves them some blog content anymore, but remember that google loves *good* blog content.  More than that, they like content that people like and sites that people like.  I'll tell you honestly that I'll never read your blog.  I'm sorry, but you won't read your blog either.

I hated them for a long time, starved myself in an effort to make them smaller, but in the end I figured they weren't going away and I learned to accept it and make it work.

Complaints aside, though, it had by far the best main storyline of any Elder Scrolls game I've played. The interplay with the church, and the slow, unreliable reveal of its roots was masterfully done.

There was a lot to admire about the worldbuilding. Especially in the politics, with so many different factions jockeying for position.

House vs house vs house. Ashlanders vs settled houses. Empire vs Dunmer. Tribunal vs secular authority. Not to mention a ton of smaller rivalries.

Skyrim comes a lot closer to this than its predecessor. The empire vs stormcloaks vs thalmor dynamic was pretty interesting to me, though they never really explored it as much as I would have liked. Hopefully they've learned from the way that aspect resonated with players, and we'll see a return to that sort of thing in Elder Scrolls 6, whenever and whatever that might be."

(http://i.imgur.com/v3LeB3y.png) In all seriousness though, this relationship is starting out weird. Like creepy weird.

Further thoughts:

-Yuuji seems to be paranoid about familial connections. This turns out to be outright insecurity and possibly self-loathing when Makina asks him to take it a step further.

-Yumiko is honestly surprised that Yuuji doesn't want to pry into her personal life. Either she didn't have a lot of privacy growing up or she was ridiculed for whatever hobby she has. Also, this school was founded solely for her. Was this with good or bad intentions?

-We've now got sections that are not from Yuujis perspective, which is fine because we get to see more of Amane's... personality...

-Every time food comes up in a VN I get hungry and I can't read cause I'm making food. Fate/Stay Night did it and Muv Luv did it and now this. 

-3 out of the 5 girls have had a scene involving cats so far. Make of that whatever you will.

Maybe I read slow, but this section took me eight hours to finish. I didn't even get to Rewrite this week. I also found every interaction with Michiru to be very repetitive and boring enough for me to skip some of her bits until one of the other girls showed up."

It is possible to manipulate those that are close to you without losing that closeness, but this is very target-specific and you won't be able to get much if any advice on that on generic online forums. In any case, I'd advise against it. Manipulating those that are close to you is a bit of a grimy activity. You are not truly close if this is what you are doing. "

mrcleanup,offmychest,1390521135.0,"&gt;Marriage doesn't stop someone from cheating on you, falling out of love with you, or wanting to leave you

True. So what to do? I learned a lot of hard lessons in my divorce, and more in my second marriage (which I am still in, and happier each year).

Here's the thing. A lot of people want a relationship so they try and make it. They either have a fantasy they are trying to fulfill, or a specific person they want, or believe that ""a good relationship takes work"".

To that I say, the real skill in relationships isn't holding on. Look around here, people have that down... ""he cheated 3 times, should I leave?"" YES! The real skill is in letting go when it becomes clear that it will not be a great match, even if ""they are a great person"". 

A great relationship isn't ""made"" it is ""found"".

So how do you find it? That's incredibly simple, and also very hard for most people. Always be yourself, and always be honest.

If you honestly represent yourself and honestly communicate, even when you fear it might upset them, you can see what the relationship really is, and if you don't *admire and respect* the person you are in a relationship, and don't feel that the person you are with *admires and respects you*, and it isn't just a misunderstanding that you can clear up with a conversation, it's time to move on.

The honesty will either drive people away or draw them in, and if it drives them away, that's good! That's how we weed out the bad matches. If it draws them in, that's good too. Don't pick based on who is kind, or popular, or rich, or good looking... pick based on who makes you feel glad that you are *you* and that you appreciate in return for who they are.

Then, just appreciate what you have. If you eat ice cream, soon it will be gone, but we still eat it, we still enjoy it, and we still look forward to it in the future. Love with the right person is something you may miss someday, but not something you will regret.

If the relationship changes, or your partner changes to the point where being yourself and being honest starts to pull you apart, then that's how things are. There will be times when work can get you through difficult spots in life, but you will do it together, and you won't do it because relationships take work, you will do it because your relationship is worth investing in. If it isn't worth investing in, don't do it. That's how people end up locked in a relationship they don't want. That's when people start to cheat, or end up miserable.

Always be true to yourself, and always be honest, and if the right person comes along, it won't be something you have to wonder about, you won't want to let them go."

We do not have all of the information, and we only have one side of the story, but this seems closer to the older friend inviting someone over to get them out of an abusive household, and then she gets romantically interested as opposed to someone much older adopting a small girl, tampering with her development in a bad way, and taking advantage of her."

H335,CCW,1390521236.0,"I carry always. I had a running discussion with a friend about this for several years until I finally won. 

I was helping him renovate a smallish rental (2 bd/1.5 bath/1200 sq feet) and we had to completely replace the front and side (carport) doors, frame and all. So we were BSing one evening, and got to talking about the upcoming work and just kidding I said to him that it would be fun to try and actually kick in a fully locked door. He got this look on his face and said we could test our theory about getting to a firearm since the entire frame had to come out.

Next weekend we went over. He put squirt gun in a kitchen drawer (fairly close to the side door) and  another on top of a shelf in the living room. Then we locked and deadbolted both doors with him inside, and me outside. I told him I'd wait about 15-20 minutes for him to settle in with a beer and I'd try and break down a door and get inside and drench him with my squirt gun. So of course I waited about 3 minutes. =)

I didn't know exactly where he was so I decided to go in the side door since it was the most concealed, and if someone was really doing a home invasion that was the most realistic choice.

***I was stunned***. It took me one solid kick and the frame splintered and the door actually bounced back off the wall and I had to slam through it. I was 90% sure I was going to kick through it in two or three tries, but I never expected it to go on the first try. I burst into the kitchen, and he was running to the kitchen. He'd been taking a leak, figuring I was going to come earlier than 15-20 minutes, but he didn't expect me to go right away. I was able to soak him good before he ever got the drawer open.

So we tried again with me inside and him coming in the front door (since there wasn't a side door anymore). He caught me sitting in the living room in a lawn chair and I didn't make it the eight feet to the squirt gun on the shelf before he soaked me.

He always carries now, and he has staged a couple firearms around his house and garage as well, which was something I also did after this. Just in case."

When it comes to birth control I think there's much more of a point that it is about control, but remember the people who scream about women getting emergency contraception are the same ones who want ever harsher penalties for men who don't want to be involved with their unwanted child. It's about control, definitely, but far more about forcing an idea of sexual behavior on BOTH genders and the people in power of both genders perpetuate it while they themselves are protected from the effects of their policies.

If it doesn't work out then at least you haven't exposed yourself to any unnecessary health or pregnancy risk, or made a relationship out to be more than what it should be.  He's obviously not ready yet, and the circumstances certainly don't make it easy.  If this is the right guy, it will be worth the bullshit.  If it's not worth the bullshit, he might not be the one.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out.  Just be yourself and do what feels right, whatever that is.  "

I was not raised racist, I grew up in very culturally diverse places, I didn't even realize that skin color made any difference to anyone whatsoever until I was 10 and we had racist neighbors.  

I'm now 31 years old and because so many young black people have chosen to project an image of ignorance, violence, and contempt for everyone but themselves I am now a racist.  

I firmly believe that everyone should be given the benefit of the doubt, I would never do anything to actually discriminate against someone, and skin color makes no difference to me when it comes to whether or not I like you.  But when I see a young black person my first thought is *not* charitable anymore.

Down vote an honest comment all you want, but who should you really be mad at; a person who was reluctantly turned slightly racist by the constant portrayal (and willful adoption of the image) of young black men as nothing but thugs and gangsters, or the culture and celebrities that made that image desirable for young black people?  I don't want to be racist and I make every effort to *never* act upon my racist thoughts, but a negative view of black people has been forced on me, not by some white supremacist group, but by how black people choose to portray themselves.

So by all means, down vote me, dismiss me as some asshole racist, move on and feel secure that my views are my problem and my fault, but until the black community recognizes how detrimental the image portrayed by black celebrities is, your young men and women will *continue* to struggle against racism brought on by your chosen role models."

execute_swiftly,ShouldIbuythisgame,1390521655.0,"Played and beat NG3 and while I struggled on harder difficulties it was nowhere near as hard as NG2.  While keeping that in mind, NG2 is better for various reasons.

They really created a solid campaign in which you got a whole arsenal of weapons that really allowed you to become a walking swiss army knife.  Each weapon had its pros and cons depending on who you were facing, same with for the ninpo.  Some weapons could just shred certain enemies while, if you used that same weapon on a different monster you'd struggle to keep your health bar. 

NG3 stripped away everything they had built on in NG2.  You no longer had your various ninpos or weapons, you simply only have your dragon sword, shurikens, and a bow (You can get some those NG2 weapons back but they are DLC or on Razors Edge for the Wii).  The biggest blow was combos don't feel as smooth as they once were nor do the specials.  Enemies begin to have that artificial hardness to them, not difficult because their moves were hard to telegraph or they were genuinely hard to beat.  The biggest slap in the face was in the day 1 release of NG3 you fight a boss of yourself that has your arsenal of weapons from NG2 as well as combos and specials.  NG2 or NGS is the one i'd buy."

pseudonomdeplume,AskWomen,1390521974.0,"First off, apologies for any formatting issues - I'm on mobile!

I got a bunch of dudes sending messages such as ""Hey bby qurl what size r ur tits?"", a few messages from 'nice guys' who put anything vaguely 'geeky' on a pedestal (""omg you like video games and lotr you are my perfect girl let's have babies!""), and many one word messages.
 
My rule (of sorts) was to only reply to something that could lead to a conversation. ""You alright?"" didn't count, since I remember the horrors of awkward MSN conversations all too well.  I did initiate the message with some dudes, but not many - more due to a lack of self confidence than anything. 
I actually ended up deleting my account, because I was sick of 75% of messages being creeps. Maybe one day I'll have the tolerance for that bs.  

Edit: The ones I explicitly didn't message back based on photos alone were topless, pouting, had a ridiculous quiff resembling an iced gem, or had a v-neck lower than mine. I just don't dig that kinda dude. Based on looks alone any guy who looked even mildly alternative was more likely to pique my interest."

MeOnTheInternet,Fitness,1390521986.0,"&gt; I don't disagree with any of the content of the article at all. I just wonder if any other gym-goers ever just stop, look around, and think to themselves, ""what the hell are we doing? This is silly."" 

ALL... THE... FUCKING... TIME! Preach on Broseph! My favourite recurring thought is ""I can't wait until a cute girl asks me to load up 300 lbs on a barbell, squat down until my ass touches grass, and then stand back up!"" In real life, all I'm asked to do is take the lid off of a really tight jar.

&gt; And they do it [excercise in a gym], I think in large part, because modern human civilization has made physical movement not just obsolete, but inconvenient to impractical for many of us living in suburban car hell with long work hours.

I have broken it down this way: The people who are exercising hard and eating well, they really just want to improve their social status (ie. be attractive to potential sexual mates and be admired by peers).

But I disagree with your opinion that civilization has made physical movement obsolete. Instead, modern civilization along with the scientific method has disseminated various efficient methods of reaching ones goals (related to physical activity in this case). There used to be a time where, if one wanted to be a better runner, they would just run all the time. Now, there are cycled diets, interval training methods, as well as strength training methods, that assist one with becoming a better runner.

We're all in the gym not because technology took away our outlets physical activity, but because modern methods dictate that the gym is a more efficient way to reach our goals."

raptor6c,AskMen,1390522017.0,"Another option is to ignore the message.  That sends the passive signal that you do mind giving him your number and aren't going to do so.  

Similar to what /u/starkraver said though this, as well as all three of your options, are inherently impolite, though I'd say #1 is the least bad as it's not quite as disrespectful as the other two.

#1 is the closest to the truth but you shy away from it because the truth might be hurtful.  That's the wrong choice as the truth is the truth regardless of how it makes someone feel.  Hiding the truth from people( who are adults) is wrong because it gives them an inaccurate picture of the world to react to, poisoning their interpretation of the world.

#2 Hides your pre-judgement of his actions by making the claim that you might honestly consider accepting any of his invites. If you do this and deny his invitations until he gives up on you that might seem less impolite to him, but from a third party perspective, knowing that you had already rejected his invites before you even gave him the opportunity to make them due to your pre-judgement of his intentions you are being disrespectful and giving him a false impression of yourself, this is worse than just admitting the unpleasant truth because you are actively trying to appear like something you are not.

#3 Is a bold faced lie if you do in fact give out your number to guys, just not this guy because you have pre-judged his intentions.  If you do give out your number to guys but only if you think they aren't romantically interested in you then this is a lie of omission meant to mask your pre-judgement, less 'wrong' than if it's a outright lie but still wrong and disrespectful for reasons similar to 2.

The best option would be to answer truthfully and fully, owning up to your pre-judgement of his intentions as the reason you don't want to give him your number or spend time around him for fear of how it might appear or how you think he might try to take advantage of the situation.  If you do this while also indicating that you understand and accept responsibility for the impoliteness of acting on your prejudice I think you save face as best as possible from an objective standpoint. You're certainly open to criticism for the impolitenss of acting on your prejudice; however, acting on prejudice while denying or obscuring the fact that that you are doing so is worse than than openly admitting your prejudice and owning the consequences.

Ostrololo,bestof,1390522270.0,"&gt; Not being attracted to the obese is one thing, excluding more than 98% of the female population is carefully taught racism.

So then whether or not preference X is bigotry hinges essentially on how many X people there are? Seems silly to me. Say I perform genocide and kill a bunch of non-Jewish people so that now Jews make up 98% of the world's population. Suddenly, now it's okay for you to have a preference of only dating Jews? After all, you will be excluding only 2% of the population.

I think it's more a question on whether X refers to a physical characteristic. Stuff like body shape, sex, hair color, whatever, these are all physical traits that can affect how attractive you perceive someone.

dakru,AskMen,1390522282.0,"Reproductive rights for men. I think it's insane that after the act of sex a man has literally zero (legal) options to avoid taking on the responsibilities of parenthood if he doesn't think he's ready. Women have done so well for themselves in this area, including the morning-after pill, abortion, adoption, and safe-haven laws. This has a massive impact on their quality of life and ability to live life as they want and not be forced in any direction as a result of circumstance.

The fact that women have all of these rights and options should be celebrated (and their rights should be defended/advocated in places that they're under attack or don't exist, like the United States and Ireland), but it stands in really stark contrast to the lack of rights and options that men have. What's horribly ironic in my opinion is the number of people who support women's reproductive rights but scoff at the idea of men having their own reproductive rights. It's even worse when they use the exact same arguments against us (""you shouldn't have had sex if you didn't want to be a parent!"") that they're used to shooting down when used against them.

I'm always happy when I see people who support both genders' reproductive rights, though.

Their biggest issue there was going from dozens of interesting, intertwining storylines into a dozen variations of ""RAR! DEATHWING BAD!"".

It still has its moment, though. I liked the Don Quixote questline from Un'Goro, and ""The Day the Dragon Came"" is still flat out one of my favorite quests in WoW, old or new.

Cata's biggest issue, really, was mediocre endgame content, paced poorly. Not to mention the way they gouged people on server transfers, which turned a small decline into a major exodus.

If it starts to run the pump as soon as the battery is hooked up then there is a short somewhere else. Probably the ECU or the Fuse Box or the Pump relay. 

If the key is out and you remove the ECU fuse and it kills the pump, you found your short. Likewise try removing the pump relay. Swap it with something that works like your headlights and if your headlights come on then that relay is toast.

But that doesn't explain why it was leaking gas. Even if the pump was running it should just flow through the regulator and back into the tank. This means you have two problems: 1) something is shorted making the pump run 2) you have a gas leak.

Check all of the rubber fuel line hoses with the shorted pump (BUT NOT THE ENGINE) running to see where it is going. If it is leaking out of a vacuum line behind the FPR replace the FPR."

nerowasframed,AskReddit,1390522581.0,"There was a really great documentary on this called, How Nero Saved Rome. They postulate that it was the architecture at that time that caused the massive fire. most home were build primarily with wood at that time. While Rome's border were not expanding, its population was. so, in order to accommodate the people, they would haphazardly just build their homes higher and higher. Collapses were frequent, and cooking frequently led to house fires at that time. After the major fire, Nero was experienced enough in architecture to recognize the problem with the housing structures. In place of the burned down communities, he built homes with wider streets and more stable architecture to help prevent spread of fire. 

There much more to the documentary, too much to put in a comment on Reddit, but I would suggest watching it. It's very good.

donaisabelle,MakeupAddiction,1390522614.0,"I have super huge purple-y bags under my eyes. Like, it's not that they're puffy. No amount of frozen spoons or tightening creams fix it. There's just extra (purple) skin there. So this is the most effective routine I've figured out thus far:

* Apply Erase Paste with a finger.
* Buff it with a smallish brush to make sure it's all even.
* With a small concealer brush, apply a line of *light-diffusing* concealer (the lighter one in my Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage) *only* to the underside of my eye bags.
* Pat (rather than rub) the light diffusing line until it doesn't stand out.

Erase Paste was never enough for me on its own, because it addressed the purple-y shade, but without making the bag itself less visible. That's where the light-diffusing concealer comes in - applying it to the underside of the bag tricks the eye into not perceiving the inward curve or indentation there, so my undereye looks flat rather than baggy.

(However, if you were to apply the light-diffusing concealer all over the under-eye area, it would ruin the effect, as the point is for the underside of the bag to look lighter *in relation* to the rest of the area.)"

It is an issue, since even a piece of a glove touching the trigger will cause the malfunction.  You can be shooting on a cooler day with your finger outside of the trigger guard, and even the slightest force on the trigger to the rear will cause the sear to disengage once the safety is disengaged.  The problem is the let-up of a very light trigger is artificially eliminated to nothing.  Meaning, you do not have to have any pressure on the trigger for it to happen; but also that you only have to hold the trigger in place, for it to go off when the safety is disengaged.  No rearward pressure on the trigger, and it will go off when the safety is disengaged.  A 2 pound trigger should not be able to go off when 1/4 ounce of pressure is applied.  To me that is definitely an, ""issue.""

A piece of grass, a slight jolt, anything that you could possibly imagine taking up that teeny tiny 1/4mm or so of travel required, will cause the gun to go off with the safety is disengaged.  Mind you, it is only really a problem with guns that have light trigger."

I was wearing high-ankled hiking boots - big, burly boots that have gotten me up mountains and taken a tremendous beating. The sort of boots that a lot of modern 'ultra-light' backpackers scoff at as being too big.

Lesson learned - motorcycle boots are *special*. They have metal bands that transfer stress away from the ankle, and this goes so much further than just simply having stiff leather around the ankle. My boots were good at immobilizing my shattered ankle and keeping the abrasion down but had I been wearing actual motorcycling boots then there would be a good chance I'd not currently be two months in to a six month healing process after having a titanium plate installed.

And you know what? If you ""wait"" for the right time in order for you life to be less hectic to meet people, you're going to be waiting a long time. Because you're going to be continually making excuses. And there people in similar situations as yourself and force themselves to go out and interact and socialize. It's just the nature of the beast. 

Also don't tell yourself that your limited dating experience is a red flag. Don't lower your value as a person. Let them decide whether or not you're datable. "

I do not, however, quite agree that the situation is completely as you describe; color me cynical (and perhaps reminiscing on events that transpired earlier in my life), but (assuming she is a rational being) I get this idea that the case of friend-turned-suitor is almost nil and fake, manipulative guys were the norm for her experience. There was nothing to suggest that there was mutual chemistry between her and the other guys; that's a pretty big indicator that the experience was not quite positive whenever it happened. They may get along greatly, but if there was no indicator of mutual sexual interest then it's reasonable to categorize the relationship as platonic.

I do think she does have the right to be able to expect certain boundaries to be established. If she has had many guy friends over a long period of time, and perhaps repeated the process of turning them down, there would at least be a reasonable expectation that she just won't be interested in them. Whether that will work against her in the future is another issue, but as it stands her circle of friends should know better at this point.

steve496,49ers,1390523037.0,"When we're talking about physical press coverage, we're mostly talking about the Seahawks; and my impression is that the Seahawks success this year was basically based on two principals:

* Getting a really good jam off the line makes it take longer to get open, and
* Having a good pass rush means you have less time for the receivers to work free once off the jam.

Fundamentally, there's three ways you can deal with this:

* Use speed to get open faster once you get off the jam,
* Use physicality to get off the jam faster, or
* Use size to box out the CB and catch passes even if you're not strictly speaking ""open"".

Ultimately: I think size and physicality can work, and its certainly the case that Boldin - who isn't going to beat anyone with his speed - had some decent games this year (outside the first one, anyway).

Your remaining questions sort of tie into future posts which I haven't fully written yet, but to paraphrase my current thinking on the high-level concepts:

* I'm not convinced we'll be drafting a WR (or TE) in the first round; I think CB is likely a bigger need.
* I'm disinclined to get another 2nd-round TE to replace the 2nd-round TE we drafted last year.
* If we do go WR in the first it may involve trading up for someone like Marqise Lee (or even Mike Evans), so both size and speed are options.
* I'll go through the cap analysis next week, but, briefly stated: I expect us to have to choose between Boldin, Whitner, Rogers, and Brown; we'll keep either one or two of those 4 players, and I wouldn't bet on it being the CBs."

nostalgicBadger,iphone,1390523103.0,"I used Android phones for about three years before switching. I'm still not entirely sold on the iPhone, but after being unhappy with a series of Android devices, I decided I should at least give the iPhone a fair shot. Anyway, this was my experience with Android:

Pros - 

 - Customization. iPhone owners like to defend their customization options, and yes, you open up more by jailbreaking, but even then, the iPhone doesn't come close, if only because far more people are designing launchers, skins and icon sets for Android, and that means more variety. Hell, you can replace the OS if you want to.

 - Swype - To replace the keyboard software for the iPhone, you have to jailbreak it, and even if you do, iSwipe Keyboard doesn't work nearly as well as Swype (and if you don't like Swype, there are a ton of other replacement options for Android).

 - Free apps - Most of the apps available for Android are free, and if you like a paid app, there's probably a free clone or an ad-supported free option. If you're on a budget or are too young to own a credit card, it's probably a huge plus.

 - Hardware variety - Only Apple makes the iPhone, so you get the hardware they decide you should have. Granted, it's pretty solid hardware, but if you're looking for a hard shutter button (or more buttons than one in general), a slideout keyboard, a 3D camera, etc. you'll want to look at Android phones.

 - Price - There are some very inexpensive Android phones out there. If you're prone to breaking or losing phones, or if you're broke, you can get a decent Android for cheap enough that it's practically disposable.

Cons - 

 - Compatibility - When you compare Android to iOS, a lot more people are using Android, but when you compare the iPhone to any particular line of Android phones, Apple wins every time. That means you've got more compatible hardware options.

 - Fragmentation - The other issue you run into, because of how many people are making Android phones, is how difficult it is to optimize the software. When someone develops an iPhone app, he knows more or less exactly what hardware he's developing for. Okay, so there's some variation between the iPhone 4 and 5s, but the variables are known, in that case. With Android, developers have no idea, so an app that runs fine on a Galaxy 4 might be prone to crashing on a Moto V, which is particularly annoying if you don't find out until after purchasing it.

 - App saturation - So you have a ton of free app options with Android, but here's the downside: most of them are terrible. With Apple, there's a financial barrier to entry, which means that people don't get involved until they're confident that they know what they're doing, so while you'll probably have to purchase an app, there's a much better chance that you'll actually like it. 

 - Bugs - This is what eventually drove me to switch: if you think iOS7 is buggy, try spending a year with an Android phone. I'd been resistant to the iPhone for a long time because of its price, Apple's marketing, a large chunk of the Apple community, the way the home screen looks, and all the pros I mentioned about Android, but after owning my last Android phone for a year, my audio drivers were crashing all the time, bluetooth was spotty at best, navigation would crash apparently for no reason, and when it was working, all the menus would flicker, and eventually I couldn't even open the stock contacts app, because a.core would crash if I did. Eventually, I decided that, despite everything I don't care for about the iPhone, as long as it's at least more reliable than the Android phones I've owned (which wouldn't take much), it's worth a fair try.

robcap,whowouldwin,1390523130.0,"My personal thoughts:

Roshi, I think, is probably bulletproof. If Goku in the opening episode isn't really injured by a handgun, I think Roshi can handle it. Though if he's not prepared to defend himself from the shot (say by focusing ki energy to make him more resilient, which is how I've always assumed Z fighters increased their durability to the point that they can shrug off planet-cracking punches but the rock Krillin threw at Goku gave him a sore head), then he may well be hurt by bullets, especially from Dante's not-exactly-your-average-pistol pistols. Also: In devil trigger, he fires energy blasts: same story? more dangerous?

You might assume roshi is much faster, but hold up. Nero shot at dante from 10 feet away and he dodged the bullet. Dante is seriously quick. He's not bulletproof like Roshi: he can be wounded, but it just never seems to bother him. I say Roshi has a helluva job beating him to death. Dante has plenty of combat experience if not (to my knowledge, I only played DMC4 and part of 3) any proper martial arts training, and he has a height advantage and a 6-foot sword to keep Roshi at a distance; I could see this being a good fight at close range. Roshi is probably stronger than Dante physically, but Dante has incredible ability to not give a shit about taking damage and could wear down Roshi's finite stamina. But has he ever been dismembered or decapitated? This could be done with a ki blast or by disarming Dante and cutting him up with his own sword.

Incidentally, Roshi is a smart fighter who can plan to his opponents weaknesses. He *could* catch Dante out, even when tired. Dante's no idiot, but he is cocky.

Roshi's kamehameha is another interesting one. Dante is capable of dodging it if it's telegraphed, but like any fighting technique it could be used to catch your opponent off guard. Can roshi fling small ki blasts, like the Z fighters are seen to do? If the kamehameha lands, it could do lasting damage. What if it were to burn away Dante's flesh, or take off a limb? The only injuries I've ever seen Dante shrug off have been stabs, blunt impacts and slices: I've never seen any *external* sign of regeneration, but that doesn't mean it isn't there.

Finally, the two powerup abilities. Devil Trigger increases Dante's speed, strength, the power of his ranged attacks, his durability, and while using it he regenerates health in-game. All in all, more of the same, just makes him much more dangerous. I see him using it to regain the advantage if the fight isn't going his way, and recover some health into the bargain. On the other hand, we've never seen full-power Roshi fight. I assume his strength in this state is going to be goddamn formidable, though Dante has fought some big, strong demons in the past, so he wouldn't be one-shotted by it. I think it goes without saying that if Roshi lands a full-power kamehameha, devil boy is in serious trouble. It also seems reasonable that the full-power mode will make Roshi more durable. So, what about his speed? I'm guessing he'll be as fast as before, or nearly so, based on Trunks vs Cell. Trunks had more ki on tap, but his bulk cost him a lot of his agility. Could full power Roshi land a hit on Dante? Could Dante and his sword hurt full-power Roshi? How long can the full-power mode be sustained for?


If Dante can wear down Roshi's stamina to the point that he can't 'block' sword strikes with a forearm and ki, then Dante chops him up or shoots him down. Roshi takes the fight at close quarters due to superior skill, but not by a huge margin, and finds it hard to do Dante lasting damage. I think Roshi takes the advantage, Dante resorts to devil trigger and does damage, Roshi powers up and becomes essentially invulnerable, but can't land a good hit. From then the only question is whether Roshi's stamina gives out so completely that Dante can take him down, or whether Roshi finishes with a kamehameha via catching Dante out and laying a smackdown.

Doomsayer189,funny,1390523143.0,"&gt;  Certainly worth more than any athlete...

I think it's kind of pointless to try and say one type of profession is more inherently valuable than another. Athletes don't make millions for no reason, after all (and let's not forget that many athletes don't actually end up getting rich anyways). I get that skilled laborers are more directly necessary for a functional society than athletes or entertainers, but so are other people like retail workers and you never hear people say the same thing about them.

I think that depends on the subreddit. Some are meant to be giant catch-alls, like most of the defaults, and those benefit from moderation strictly based on rules.

Others, like /r/NeutralPolitics for example, are based around the idea of quality discussion on a theme. Sometimes it's worth it to focus less on the theme, and more like the quality. For example, the mods let [Grover Norquist give an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/1qekqi/ask_grover_norquist_anything_founder_and/) knowing that it would not be decidedly neutral. The benefit to the quality of discussion was worth the slight deviation from the theme. "

citadel_lewis,askphilosophy,1390523174.0,"&gt;The question of intent is a valid one, but be careful about appealing to ignorance: do not confuse unanswered questions with unanswerable mysteries.

You're appealing to a possible future. We may well be able to detect intent at some future stage, but we can't now. If we can't ascertain intent, how can you say ""the mind is blatantly not private""? If all you mean is that we can detect lies with 70-90% accuracy, and that we can produce neuroimages from correlating results from a test subject being told mental images to think of, fine. But that is not ""the mind is blatantly not private"". They can't just strap someone off the street into a neuroimager and get a video/audio feed if their thoughts. Whatever they can do is conducted in very controlled conditions. I'm not disputing where the science is at the moment, I'm disputing your claim that the mind is ""blatantly not private"". I don't think you'll find many people who think my disagreement is unreasonable. But, in the end, it's a difference of opinion. I'm happy to agree to disagree. But you even admit that intention, for the time being, is a private aspect of the mind. You seem to be arguing in the context of ""winning"" - you even mention that being the context of our argument. I'm not interested in being seen as winning the argument, I'm interested in a discussion where someone the other participant's sole aim is to win some imaginary prize.

So, can you possibly bring yourself to just accept that we disagree whether the mind is blatantly private or not? Because I don't disagree with much else you say except that."

I would watch movies I'd already seen that had sad parts and cry, it was a great cathartic release and I could channel it through another story so it wouldn't be all about my relationship.  

On other notes, exercise is great.  Nothing helps a breakup like a shot of endorphins and that feeling like you're being proactive in your life.  Also, when you don't feel like seeing people and just want to hole up and isolate yourself, that may mean that you need people and interaction even more.  Make yourself see your friends and get out of your house.

I also tried to be friends with my ex pretty soon after the breakup as well.  He had been my best friend for so long, how could he not be in my life?  But every time I saw him it would send me into a week long tailspin.  I wasn't ready.  I had to not see him at all for a long while to really heal.

If you want an experiment in first-person gaming, a game that redefined the word ""flow"" for me, a game that encourages you to run from enemies rather than fight them, then this is your game.

If you want a game that breaks the gunmetal-grey trend of recent years with bold, striking visuals, combined with a unique story, a perfectly-integrated soundtrack, and a minimalist approach to storytelling, then this is your game.

If you want a breath of fresh air in a medium choked by burly men firing guns over small blocks, a game that forces you to experience every missed jump and fingernail grab from the intimate viewpoint of behind your character's eyes, a game that will grab you by the spine and compel you to *run*, a game that perfectly creates its world of information control and the Runners who fight against it without fighting - a game that gives you one of the most unique and spectacular experiences in gaming history, that of fully-realised, first-person parkour - then Mirror's Edge is your game.

I can't recommend it enough. Anyone who's ever tried to speed-run a game, bunny-hopped, crouch-jumped, or even hopped onto something they shouldn't have in a game, should play Mirror's Edge. It'll change the way you look at movement in games forever."

WraithPDX,AdviceAnimals,1390523400.0,"I have a kind of similar experience, but he's not firing people. He's keeping the cheapest people around while expecting productivity to soar. I got hired a couple months after I graduated. $12 an hour starting wage for a job that typically pays $16 minimum. I'm maxed out at $14 an hour, and that's despite having tons of experience in my field and knowing how to do it better than he does.

Most other employees makes minimum wage, and they don't do good work. My boss is delusional: he wants to have tons of extra business and these huge aspirations, but he keeps people hired that are holding them back. He also makes terrible business decisions that cause us to get behind in our work constantly, then he blames us for falling behind. Example: Last week I was 100% caught up. Then he told a customer to send all their work to us. As of today I am 2-3 weeks behind schedule, and he acts like it's my fault. He makes people work outside of their departments because he's so cheap. I started being in charge of assets management, and now I do deliveries, shipping/receiving and some manufacturing, a role I fucking hate with a passion. I got bumped up to $14 only because the boss realized that since I was a Veteran and chose the VA (way better than what he offers, sadly) he saved more money by having me opt out than by having me take it.

I have no loyalty to him or his company, but I bust my ass trying to make things better, only to be shot down at every suggestion. I explained numerous times how he could save money in one area or get better productivity in another since I have experience with it. I have shown him visual data of what is wrong and where things can be improved. No go. Things still run like shit, problems keep popping up, and he acts like they will fix themselves.

This is why I've been trying so damn hard to find another job, and why I'm on the verge of quitting even though I don't have another one lined up. Sorry for this rant, but goddamn is so frustrating witnessing this insanity every day."
keakealani,singing,1390523400.0,"You could definitely work on breathing exercises or very gentle vocalization. I agree with others that really it's best not to sing at all at the height of a cold. But, if you feel like your throat is doing okay, some gentle exercises in the mid-range are probably fine. 

But, there are also a lot of exercises you could do without actually singing. You can work on translation or diction, or you can research new repertoire. You can clap the rhythm, or practice entrances with the accompaniment. You can listen and memorize. While obviously nothing replaces actual singing, there is still lots you can do while you recover from an illness."

Used parts aren't necessarily *bad*, just used. The front bumper off a vehicle that was rear-ended should still be fine, for example. Keep in mind, the parts on your car were ""used"" by the time of the accident, even if you bought the car new.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390523706.0,"So I do nothing to hide my distaste for the SVD, I won't recommend that.  After mine had it's button go soft it has been employed as a voltmeter and ohm checker.  I had a couple eGo batteries that had some issues 2 weeks in too, so I've pretty much switched to mechs entirely and have zero regrets.  Having said that, the Vamo APVs seem to be respectable units, just too big and awkward compared to a mech.  They're every bit as long as an SVD, and there is nothing subtle about them.

Ohms law is definitely worth coming to grips with for a mech.  On an APV if you want more or less power you click a button.  On a mech if youth want more or less power you run a different coil.  The good side is that you can pretty easily run 30 watts without dropping $300 on a DNA30 mod, and with the right battery you can go even higher.  They're small, durable, and simple to understand...  But they require that you pay a little attention to what they're doing.

An APV tends to be larger, but requires a little less thought.  They have limits on what coils they can fire and how much power they'll supply to those coils, but those limits are there as safety features.  I do like you they can kick the power up to more than the 3.7 volts (4.2 on a fresh charge) that a mech gives, so you can get beefier coils to behave more like low resistance coils.  Of course they tend to be fairly inefficient when they kick the power up, but they work.

**TL;DR:** Get a mech if you want simple, small, and durable, but requiring some thought.  Get an APV if you don't want to think about your vape and size is of no concern."

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390524099.0,"The mockery fodder was above.

On a more serious note though, this article hit close to home. 

A little context:

When I originally read about the ""Dark Enlightenment"", first thought that came to thought was ""neo-KKK"". Fantastical images of Imperial Wizards, Imperial Cyclopses, and Grand Dragons flew through my mind. Sure enough, a bunch of the representatives of this neo-reactionary movement are pressed onto digital Magic Cards.

You flip through the Radish page, and the chart (which I've seen posted here in this sub in the past) and sure enough you also get redpill.

What makes this ""fresh"" and hit close to home for me is that [taken from the above article]:

&gt; What distinguishes neo-reactionaries from run of the mill ditto heads or military types with a taste for Dock Martins or short pants is that they tend to be latte drinking Silicon Valley nerds who have some connection to both the tech and trans-humanist communities.

I live here, and can actually confirm. I know this sub's main intent is just to mock, and it's a habit of people to disbelieve. Cynicism picked up from reading so many field reports or seemingly too-fantastic stories of success on TRP, reinforced by beliefs what normality should be. But I know a lot of people who fit the bill. Not traditional, stereotypical neo-reactionaries. Rather intelligent (generally) guys who are perfectly pleasant, and many of them successful.

oldneckbeard,programming,1390524184.0,"His example of broken EC for votes is the same thing you have in the RDBMS world. Say you're updating a product, and 2 people issue these commands simultaneously: 

1. update product set quantity=quantity-1;
2. update product set quantity=quantity-1;

This looks safe enough, but it's a bug. When you begin a transaction, you get a ""local"" snapshot of the data. So both 1 and 2 have a transaction open, and they both see ""2"" as the quantity. So they both set quantity=1, and they both get committed, as they're both valid statements. 

The solution to this in the RDBMS world is optimistic (or pessimistic, depending on your level of ocd) locking. So the statements look more like this: 

1. update product set quantity=quantity-1, version=301 where version=300
2. update product set quantity=quantity-1, version=301 where version=300

The first one in will succeed, the second one in will fail (you can check this by validating that the number of affected rows &gt; 0), and you have to resolve it.

In the nosql world, I've written a couple eventually-consistent systems. This problem is the hard one to solve. The trouble with nosql is that if you expect it to operate like an RDBMS, you're going to fail. It's not ACID by design, so trying to hack those features on is going to introduce a lot of subtle bugs. That's why so many engines just ignore it, it's just too hard (or impossible) to solve. "

Viktor does indeed already have good burst damage but having augment death gives him even more potential for a E+R combo to kill all enemies.

You can also zone enemies with viktors E which not only zones that like W it also deals tons of damage.

CDR is pretty good but viktor is a burst champion and what you want to do is kill your target instantly and if you do that, you don't need cooldown for nothing.

Mana? Yeah, that's a huge problem for viktor but i usually get blue and that fixes all my problems, even if i don't why would i need it i just win teamfights by doing 1 combo and my teammates do the rest.

Well, most of what's left, anyway.  The four middle squares of the six covered ones between the two 1s on the bottom row are probably safe.  99% certainty.  From what's uncovered there, you can probably work out where at least one mine is.  Once you've got that, it's just a matter of following on from there.

keakealani,singing,1390524358.0,"I like your sound a lot! It sounds untrained, sure, but you have a pleasant sounding voice which is really the first step. But, since you're asking for critique...

Speaking about diction, be very careful about pure vowels and avoid diphthongs. It's difficult for a native English speaking, but Italian really doesn't use many diphthongs at all. For example, /e/ should (almost) never sound [ei], and same for /o/ (not [ou]). 

For technical critique, I think you could benefit from grounding yourself better. You're pacing around a bit on stage, and while there's nothing wrong with movement, I get the impression that the pacing is more either out of nervous habit or as a substitute for support (as actually the leg muscles can facilitate some breath support). But, you need to start with a good core sound before you can add motion, and the motion should be more deliberate, rather than pacing around without direction. 

Also, I feel like you could put more breath especially behind the high notes. It sounds strained and although it's hard to tell exactly, I suspect your larynx is a bit high as you try to hit those high notes. This is actually where the grounding might help - some people (myself included) find that visualizing high notes as going down, toward your core, helps you engage the breath more effectively. Try even bending your knees slightly while maintaining an upright posture - and really feel your weight sinking into the ground as you get toward the top of your range. This is also a good exercise to do in your warmups - practice vocalises that go up and over your high range but with a strong, grounded body. 

Overall, lovely sound. Keep working on that diction - I think cleaning up the vowels will actually also do a lot for the color of your voice. Unfortunately English diphthongs are very difficult to make into pretty sounds, while Italian pure vowels are actually much easier (at least for me). So as you clean up those vowels, I think you'll find a freer and purer color too :)"
n3verlose,gaming,1390524358.0,"&gt;Wouldn't it have to consider at least some aspects of climate when figuring out the colors and textures? A desert area vs a meadow, for example. It wouldn't be right to have trees in either, but you'd find grass with trees in other places.

This was discussed earlier in the thread by others. They split the map in to 50mX50m squares, and assign a biome label to each one (desert, coniferous forest, deciduous forest, tundra, etc.). For the earth, this is done by computers using learning algorithms with satellite imagery (I've personally worked on a recent one of Canada). With something like middle earth it was probably done by hand, with computer assistance. Climate modelling like that is far too complex to screw around with it for something like this.

Once each 50x50 square has a biome label, they use another algorithm to generate the scene in each square, depending on its label. It renders grass, trees, textures etc. depending on what the label is. They would almost definitely use some sort of random distribution to prevent each square from being identical (that doesn't look realistic).

&gt;Hmm, if the map is - I don't know how to put this - dynamic(?) then it might be capable of making areas wash out from rain. Like mudslides and all that.

A huge part of gaming and computer graphics is faking things well enough that they *look* real. For instance, they could hire a meteorologist, and have him spend awhile analyzing what the weather might be like in middle earth. Then have somebody store that in a file, and have the computer render the contents of the file. This way, it looks like weather, but they are in no way modelling weather over the terrain. 

Another example of this concept is the way games usually render bodies of water like the ocean. They superimpose sine waves in different directions on the ocean's surface to create realistic wave effects (Assasin's Creed). There are no actual fluid dynamics simulations going on, we can't really do that in real-time yet.

paytonpls,indianapolis,1390524407.0,"I have Comcast and for the most part it isn't awful, but we did have an awful experience with one of the service guys.

We'd been having problems with the internet/tv for a few weeks. We would constantly have to disconnect and then reconnect the internet.

We called, and they sent someone out. He came out and said there was interference with the lines and he would drive around to see if he could find the source and to wait a MONTH and then to call again if we were having problems. Of course, the problems continued. We called again and another guy came out, and when we told him what happened with the first guy, he said that certain guy does it all the time, he would introduce himself with a new name every single time and give the same story about ""Interference with the lines"" and would say the exact same thing about driving around and checking to see if he could find the source. This guy would just drive around and not actually do any work whatsoever.

Aside from that one bad experience, I think Comcast is okay. We've had a few issues where we'll have to disconnect then reconnect to the internet (that doesn't happen that often though), and a few outages, but nothing too bad."

We had been best friends (and known each other) for a couple months before I decided I really liked her. That day we had sex. Don't know how you want to count that. 

I met her best friend at the time about a week later at her best friend's rehearsal dinner.  I met her current best friend 3 years before my wife and I met. 

Met her parents about three months later. That was extremely awkward and weird.  Mostly because her ""step dad"" was only a year older than me and I was only 24 years old. 

I told her I loved her about a year after we got together.  Not because I didn't love her much earlier, but my actions tell the story not words. 

She started being a constant fixture at my place almost immediately. A couple months after that her lease ran out on the apartment she hadn't been to in a month and she moved in. 

I told her that I was not going to get engaged until I was 28. 4 days after I turned 27 she proposed to me and I said yes. We were together 3 years at that point.

That might be your opinion, or you might be hunting for witches, but it's not that cut and dry in real life.  I had a rifle that had the problem, and let me tell you, it took no pressure at all to replicate the issue.  You could replicate that problem by pressing on trigger back with a tissue paper.  A properly designed trigger should only fire the weapon when a specified pull force has been achieved, and it should be at least equal to that of the trigger being pulled without the safety on.  If part of my glove was hitting the trigger, then I would technically be guilty according to you.  Having a weapon that punishes you for not adhering absolutely to some safety rule set does nothing but detract from its usefulness.  Guns should be designed for safety; even the safety of fools.  Fact of the matter is that such a trigger is unreasonably safe."

How about the differences between the heavier weapons, like comparing hammer and great sword?  To me they feel like they serve the same function more or less...is it just a matter of personal preference?  Or are there pros and cons I should be considering?  "

citadel_lewis,askphilosophy,1390524545.0,"[This](http://www.jaapl.org/content/36/4/491.full) is interesting:

&gt;Despite the intriguing results described in the preceding sections, how well fMRI lie detection would work in real-life situations remains an open question. It is important to bear in mind that, like the polygraph, fMRI lie detection requires a willing subject. If an individual refuses to enter the scanner, refuses to respond to the questions presented, or gives nonresponsive answers, the technique cannot be used. Even simply moving one's head during scanning could prevent the collection of usable data.

So, all that one needs to do to protect the privacy of their mind is not cooperate. The mind losing its privacy in this context requires the cooperation of the subject. But even then,

&gt;Over and above these hindrances are more complex questions about transitioning from the research laboratory to the real world. 

So, it's unknown if these results are even valid outside of the laboratory.

Edit: also [this](http://www.nature.com/news/brain-decoding-reading-minds-1.13989 ): 

&gt;Standardization is likely to be necessary for many of the talked-about applications of brain decoding — those that would involve reading someone's hidden or unconscious thoughts. **And although such applications are not yet possible**, companies are taking notice. 

And this from the same article:

&gt; Gallant's lab has preliminary indications of just how difficult it will be. Using a first-person, combat-themed video game called Counterstrike, the researchers tried to see if they could decode an intention to go left or right, chase an enemy or fire a gun. They could just about decode an intention to move around; but everything else in the fMRI data was swamped by the signal from participants' emotions when they were being fired at or killed in the game. These signals — especially death, says Gallant — overrode any fine-grained information about intention.

&gt;The same is true for dreams. Kamitani and his team published their attempts at dream decoding in Science earlier this year6. They let participants fall asleep in the scanner and then woke them periodically, asking them to recall what they had seen. The team tried first to reconstruct the actual visual information in dreams, but eventually resorted to word categories. Their program was able to predict with 60% accuracy what categories of objects, such as cars, text, men or women, featured in people's dreams.

It seems pretty clear that the statement ""the mind is blatantly not private"" is not true. Technology is encroaching on the mind's privacy, but has a long, long way to go before it blatantly strips it of it."

*Ingredients:*

Enough rice for two

Roughly 1/5 pound masago (capelin roe) and 1/5 pound tobiko (flying fish roe)

1/3 to 1/2 lb pickled daikon, sliced or chopped

6 sesame leaves, thinly sliced

A couple handfuls of sliced nori

2 eggs

1/2 tbs sesame oil

*Prep:*

Cook rice, then stir in sesame oil.

Divide rice into two bowls.  Divide all other ingredients into equal portions.

Fry the eggs (I like them sunny-side up).

Arrange all ingredients in a nice, pretty circle around the edge of each bowl.  Throw a fried egg on top of each bowl (not pictured in my image; I was frying the eggs when I took it).

Mix after serving and enjoy!

Daveezie,todayilearned,1390524803.0,"Your fear of guns does not trump my right to defend myself from an attacker. Sorry to break your heart with that statement, but your fear is not a reason that my ability to defend myself should be stripped. Also, people who legally own firearms are generally unlikely to commit gun related crimes. We actually have a tendency to stay out of trouble because we like our guns. Not only does having a felony prevent us from owning a self defense tool, it keeps us from going to the range or hunting. I can't speak for hunting, but shooting at paper is pretty fucking fun, so I am going to keep my felony count at a big fat 0 so I can continue to own them.

That being said, you know who attacks random people? Criminals. That is pretty much it. Your fear of a lawful gun owner is unfounded. You are afraid of a person because of what they own. How do you even leave the house? I guarantee you that when you walk down the street, someone you pass is armed. And you wouldnt even know it.

Your hoplophobia must be crippling. Oh, except you probably leave the house every now and then and walk, or drive, to the store, or to work.

Dookiet,AskReddit,1390525040.0,"As a professionally trained archaeologist it's not that life expectancy has changed. It's the fact that  because of the way it's expressed we forget the toll of child morbidity and mortality. It's quite easily arguable that vaccines alone are responsible for most of the changes in human life expectancy.  It's also the common assumption that prehistoric peoples lived short brutish lives and died miserable, or were less capable than we are. The truth is they delt with greater challenges, but were just as we are (it's the same assumptions that lead to ""aliens"").  And middle age Europe (due to populations density) was more disease riddled than many early societies, and it's easy to forget that lack of health used to be associated with the upper class, as the lower class ate healthier, and often had great cardiovascular health.  Granted modern medicine has made huge strides in longevity."

Not only that, but we are so unreasonable and selfish as a species, that even the ""reasonable"" ones who make the laws make laws that are detrimental to society.  There has to be a balance of freedom to live your life as you choose and protecting others from being the victims of your life's choices through no fault of their own.   For instance, people know cigarettes and soda are bad for you; it's common knowledge.  A libertarian would say, ""well as long as we all know they are bad, no one will buy them and they will go out of business"".  Think of if there was nothing stopping food companies from putting deadly toxins in the water or food supply while at the same time giving you cheaper and more delicious food and water.

Their music was perfect for 16 year old me in the nineties that didn't particularly like grunge or alternative. I wanted long guitar solos and improvisation, and they have all of that and more. Nobody else creates music the way those four guys do. Their obsession with their live shows is contagious. I believe the absolute worst thing you can say about band after a concert is ""they sounded just like the CD"" and Phish never disappoints in this aspect. Every show is new. Every concert is different, hell every time they play a song, it's different from the last time they played it.

Then there's the community. The in-jokes are stupid enough to be perfect for my asinine sense of humor. The camaraderie between the audience members at the shows just makes you feel welcome and part of.. something. The way the band interacts and plays to and for and with the audience, the way they listen to the audience, and feed off it, makes you feel not just like a spectator, but like you're helping and important.

There are hundreds of other bands I like, but I always come back to Phish as the pinnacle of the live music experience."

Not saying that honesty isn't good. It is and it is required to have a strong relationship. That said, in my very limited opinion, it might have been a bit too much info at once. 

Masturbation and porn, for that matter, for some can negatively impact a relationship if it  intrudes to the point of having one partner consider it an issue. But the flip side is that it can be good for people too if managed properly and discussed in a way that is good for the relationship. 

There is no instruction  manual for this as it varies for each person. 

So, while I am not telling you to hide your activities, you might want to tone down the specifics unless you can both have an open, honest, and non-judge mental discussion.

sunofabeeeyetch,AskReddit,1390525350.0,"Funnily enough, the crackhouse incident happened to a black man. I'm assuming he won't be undergoing vitiligo or plastic surgery any time soon.

Anyway, this was a few months ago, when my friends and I were chilling at one of our rooms (for the sake of clarity, let's call him M and the hero of our story L). M and his roommate have procured an enormous amount of alcohol, and we--as freshman tend to do--were guzzling it by the can. Busch Lite is nasty but it does the job. 

So in comes L, with a full-on handle of vodka in his enormous hands. After some small-talk, he claims ""this doesn't taste like anything"" and downs what had to be half the bottle in one continuous take. Mind you, L was a linebacker in the college football team and as such is closer to a bear than a human being in terms of size, so we didn't think too much about it. He hadn't smoked any weed yet, so we didn't think he'd repeat his infamous Halloween incident (which is another story); we all assumed he knew what he was doing. A short while afterwards, he walks out of the room while chugging his bottle, and we resume the festivities.

The rest of the night went on without incident, and nobody thought too much about what L was doing. Some folks mumbled on about how he was a bit of an idiot and that he was probably going to be hungover the next morning, but none of us were worried.

The next day, M calls us up and asks if anyone has seen L. Since we're not super close, most of us said no; if we had been roommates, I might have been able to give a clue, but as it stood nobody knew where he was. To make matters worse, he was to be responsible for a football recruit later on in the evening, so we had to find him fast.

We were ultimately unsuccessful, but only because L solved the mystery for us. A little later on, he stumbles into M's room while looking somewhat dazed. Being curious, we asked what had happened.

Turns out that, after chugging a handle of vodka almost exclusively by himself, he had blacked out and started walking randomly. When he woke up, he was completely unfamiliar with his surroundings, which apparently consisted of a dilapidated and abandoned residence (no furniture, wallpaper peeling, etc.); after a moment of shock, we collectively agreed with the notion that it must have been a crackhouse. He looked somewhat shaken and disturbed at the revelation, musing all the while how he had not been stabbed (being a 250lb muscular black man probably didn't enter his thought process).

When asked how he got back, he chuckled lightly and said that he asked a policeman to give him a ride. Apparently he wasn't tested or questioned or anything.

He did get back in time to pick up his recruit, if you were wondering.

So yeah, don't be that guy."

NanoNarse,unitedkingdom,1390525371.0,"I was overqualified, and was asked about my degree in every interview I've been in. Luckily, I had a lot of experience in retail prior to my degree and knew how to ease their fears. Honestly, my retail resume is better than 90% of applications I see and I got through on the strength of it.

Even then, GAME and Starbucks were the only two places to offer me an interview. I applied to countless stores that never responded, and was told flat out by two managers that ""we don't hire graduates."" I wouldn't want to be another graduate going for those jobs.

I bet she had the same thought process. It wasn't a big deal, but the way you approached her was irritating. Does that make sense?

&gt;She and I are well beyond the point of ""you better give me $5 for me to grab a sandwich for you""

That's not how it always works. Her response indicates that there is some resentment built up over issues like this. Maybe you passed that point, but now you're back to it because she feels like you haven't been pulling your own weight. Now, I don't know you guys, so I can't say if that's true, but it seems to be how she feels.

&gt;she is not THAT financially strained

Not everyone is okay with staying just above broke at all times, especially when there's a kid in the mix.

&gt;she says she feels crappy basically every day. I hear the same thing every day from her - everything sucks, I feel like shit. Constant. It's hard for me to sympathize thoroughly every time when I hear it so much.

sovietterran,AdviceAnimals,1390525499.0,"Except that there are tons of little exceptions attached to everything. As long as a company offers you anything that meets the aca mandate, then they can also sell plans that do not. Also, as long as your company has a plan that follows the aca that does not cost more than a certain percentage of your income (I think 8 percent) you do not qualify for subsidies( which pay out for private plans). The final nail in the coffin is certain aca plans do not qualify for subsidies either. Mainly the ""catastrophe"" plans. I'm pretty sure all bronze plans are lumped in there. There is one plan I could maybe afford, a 180 dollar plan, but I'm almost positive it would not qualify for subsidies due to it being ""not good enough"". It also has a 5800 dollar deductible. Per visit. Before the aca was passed I could get a better deductible on a similar plan for 60 a month with a 40 dollar copay. The aca made it illegal to charge more than 300 percent more for age related risk and made it illegal to charge more for chronic illnesses. That means healthy young kids are paying more. Look at the average. Some places are reporting an average of a quadruple in prices for people under 30. THAT is the issue here. This bill is overly convoluted and relies on morality dictating the final outcome vs reality. The reality is I'm up a river.  

Edit: my company offers aca compatible plans... For 330 bucks a month. I can't afford that. But they have a non-aca plan for 20 bucks a month with a 50 dollar copay and a max payout of 10k. They can still offer it because of they way the aca is worded. I'm also pretty sure I do not qualify for medicaid and while I may qualify for aid with ""qualifying"" plans, all of them would be up towards that cost. I had a workable plan with a 2000 dollar deductible that got axed because I didn't have coverage I'd only need if I was currently sexually active. Now I have nothing. I'm in Colorado BTW. "

Whizbang,AskReddit,1390525655.0,"Speaking as a huge ragtime fan, I feel obliged to add that the 1893 World's Fair was called the [World's Columbian Exposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_Columbian_Exposition)!

In fact, I was delighted, having travelled through the San Francisco airport recently, to see a 'board game museum' in which one of the games was a Parcheesi-like board game set in the World's Columbian Exposition. IIRC, one of the things that could happen was that you'd land on a space that said something like ""Caught for public brawling--sent back to the administration building""

EDIT: I had taken some pictures--sorry about quality: [phone pics](http://imgur.com/UFAKkd8,lAnPDaG#0). It wasn't ""brawling"" but ""assault and battery"". The board game itself says ""World's Fair"" but the placard says ""World's Columbian Exposition,"" which is the way it's referred to in my history books. The ""Salem MA"" you can make out on the cover of the box is where the board game was published.

The World's Columbian Exposition is important because it's where mainstream America may have been exposed to the first ragtime pieces. Some important ragtime composers and performers may have gotten their first chance to perform for mainstream America at this event. (Certainly, Scott Joplin composed his ""Cascades"" rag in honor of the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair / Louisiana Purchase Exposition… these were important events!)"

tattedspyder,explainlikeimfive,1390525721.0,"It depends on the type of explosion and your proximity.

If it's a gas or flammable liquid explosion (a fireball type normally seen in movies) the flames and heat would be the killer as these explosions are actually very slow moving and generate a very weak shockwave.

In an explosion caused by actual explosives the heat is quite high but very localized so little of the damage caused is attributable to that.  The main killer is the shockwave.  It causes an extremely rapid change in pressure inside your body and that rapid pressure change causes massive damage to your internal organs.  Depending on the power of the explosion, however, the shockwave's energy dissipates fairly rapidly and you can be surprisingly close without being injured.

The last cause of injury is from flying debris, which causes cutting and piercing injuries that kill you with blood loss or massive organ damage.  This is more common with actual explosions and less so with fireballs because the fireball typically does not generate a strong enough shockwave to propel debris at lethal velocities."

Potatoe_away,videos,1390525734.0,"I don't think you understand the costs involved, a car windshield goes for what, $100? The windshield for the helicopter I currently fly is $85,000. Want a basic moving map in a car, probably $1200 installed. In an aircraft, $10,500 not installed. Hell the helicopter in the video will run you about $200,000.  Why is everything so expensive? Well it's testing, yes they have to test the airbags in weather conditions(I'll admit that was a poor example), but they don't have to test them at a 30 degree bank in all weather conditions with all possible accessory equipment installed, then retest with this radio transmitting, then the other one..etc.  You're talking millions of dollars in certification costs. 

I used a '57 Chevy as an example because the helicopter in the video first flew around then. 

The fact is, proportionate to the costs of a helicopter it is too expensive, and frankly they aren't needed on most because they can be safely flown with training. 

p.s. Funny story the U.S. Army spent millions installing airbags in Blackhawks and had to pull them out when they started going off inadvertently and almost causing crashes. "

I don't talk at length about the baby with the nosy/baby-obsessed people because I need to get the most out of my day because I need to leave by 4:30. 

After she goes to bed (she sleeps 10-11 hours straight at night, thank god), I'll boot up the laptop and take care of work emails.

I'll come up with a game plan for a meeting I'm going to run or a list of things I can give to our underutilized intern, etc. 

The other thing that lots of people forget about is having a partnership with your spouse/SO. The partner needs to know that helping with meals, dishes, laundry, etc is not helping YOU out. It's doing work that's crucial to keeping the household in balance.

They got a last meal of their favorite foods and were allowed to see their family, they were bathed and given a fresh white robe to wear. The death was confirmed by local magistrates when it occurred and spectators were often present.

Of course, afterwards, we learned that we could be more proactive in getting it to happen more often. Not every time but, if its a focus, we know how to do it. 

Also, part of this was me learning to do it myself so that I was comfortable in the feeling that accompanies it and could tell him what felt good in working on that and what didn't feel good. 

Part of my issue was getting over the feeling that I was going to pee. I never did pee but oh my gosh it feels like I am going to right before I get to the point of having an orgasming that results in me squirting. 

Also, sometimes it is just a bit of increased wetness and sometimes it is a bit more. I never has looked like some of what is seen on porn where it's like an explosion of liquid from between my legs. 

I will say that most of the time the accompanying orgasm is extremely intense and results in me feeling like I am going to black out (I haven't) and have my legs go a bit numb or tingly. Afterwards, I don't want another O and am ready to crash into a blissful sleep so keep that in mind. 

It takes a bit of work at times and I have been a little sore the next morning but not do bad that it made me regret the effort or outcome (pun not intended).

I actually have 4 flower girls O.O my fiance has a daughter so she'll be one, along with 3 other girls who are very important to me :)

The dress itself was surprisingly not that hard, I'm sure I did a bunch of stuff wrong but it looks ok so I guess thats a win haha

I used a really soft white fabric, I think it's muslin, and made a tube, I stitched elastic around the top. I wanted the tube to just slip on so I used the elastic to keep it from being huge. I closed up the tube, realized I probably should have put the lace on first, ripped out the stitches and put the lace on, then stitched it back together. the lace is really roughly sewn on since the bottom edge won't show. I used the no-sew technique for the tutu, it's attached to a spare piece of muslin since the ribbon I bought for it isn't the right kind :( I don't plan on having it show so it should be ok. It'll be covered with the pink ribbon. I put the straps on backwards, I'll either take them off and put them back on the right way or I'll try to tack the edges down facing the right direction.

The wedding is 9/28 so I have a good amount of time to make the other 3 dresses, especially since this took 2.5-3 hours from start to finish. 

The colors are petal and rosewood (from David's Bridal), and so far the only other thing I've made were the [flower girl baskets](http://i.imgur.com/MIYrkYC.png).

It means you don't require the approval of others but at the same time you are able to recognize the strengths of others.

People who are easily offended or sensitive to insult are not confident because their measure of self-worth is not intrinsic - they require others to give it to them.

Gorptastic,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390526286.0,"I read through Block's paper and think I have a good grasp on his and Friedman's arguments. Coming from the consequentialist/economic utilitarian point of view, here it goes.

I think Block is wrong on comment (2.2). His refutation, with help from Rothbard in the quote, is that someone *can* interfere with another person's property as long as that property owner cannot detect or sense the disturbance. One, part of enjoying a property right is being able to determine who can use your property and how they can use it. If we reduce it down to ""does the owner *know* I'm messing with his property?"" Then we have ignored the owner's rights to unilaterally determine how his property is used. Plus, Block is just rewording the consequentialist argument that someone can violate property rights *as long as* there is no harm done. Block is measuring the *legality* of an action (breathing on someone's property) by its *consequences*, not from the perspective of the owner himself.

I have the same problem with Block's argument (2.3). Why should it be up to the courts to determine how intrusive someone's invasion of property rights can be? If someone truly has the right to property, then they can and *must* be able to set whatever rules they want about it. Anything less is, by the deontological definiton, coercive.

Block tries to dispel the ""absoluteness"" of property rights (2.4), but in doing so he falls right back into a consequentialist way of thinking. You can't have your property rights and be told how to enjoy them by other people. When you start debating on the *level*, not *validity*, of interference you must distinguish each interference based on the consequences. Which is exactly what Block does.

(2.9) Block's mention of ""mis-specified"" rights deeply troubles me. Is he seriously implying that the moviegoers have no right to not be killed? I've read that argument four times now and I can't believe he means this. Help me understand how there is no conflict of rights as Friedman describes.

(2.10-2.11) I've never understood how deontological libertarians like Block can reconcile the idea that a hero *does a morally good act* with a violation of property rights which is categorically *illegal*. Why should that be a foundation for a theory of law in society? If an action is moral and illegal, that is a fault with the law (in this case, the NAP), not morality. As a side note, why would anyone in the hero's society NOT punish him? Rationally speaking, if I can get my ""pound of flesh"" at no cost to myself, I should sue the hero. Everyone should or else the hero violates their rights with no compensation to themselves. Under such a scenario, who would ever get the incentive to become the next hero?

(3.2) While we can't measure utils numerically, we CAN rank preferences in order from most valued to least valued. People reveal how much they prefer something over the course of time, price being an excellent signal. It doesn't matter if we get a numerical amount of *how much* society is better off with a certain action, but rather that *it is* better off. On the other hand, to Block's credit, his utility monster critique is valid. He describes this more in (3.5) and so will I.

(3.3) This was a pretty good argument until the last paragraph. Block can imagine any combination of scenarios where it would (or would not) give higher utility for the mob to kill the black prisoner. I don't see how this refutes Friedman or consequentialism, because Block himself is judging the merits of killing the prisoner based on its consequences. I mean, what if we had 100% knowledge that the prisoner would grow up to become Hitler? Is it justice to kill him now? Let's not get silly here.

(3.4) A interesting and funny proposition! But it confuses numerical utils with ranked preferences. Yes, it is arbitrary to assign numbers for utility. But we can be fairly confident in how much people *prefer* one thing over another. If selling eyeballs on the market gave an equilibrium price of $1,000,000, for example, many people may actually be induced to sell their eyeballs to the blind. If they're too poor to afford it, then our utility-maximizing world will create charities or crowd source ways to maximize the eyeball trade. [This could happen today with kidneys, as Gary Becker has written about recently](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304149404579322560004817176).

(3.5) Block raises the question about ""what if peoples' utilities are not equally valued"". I think this is a valid critique, but again this doesn't affect consequentialism in the slightest. As if Austrian economics doesn't take into account a few assumptions before it gets to its conclusive principles? Come on. Let his ideology which is without assumptions throw the first stone. Assuming that everyone's utility matters the same is a pretty intuitive way of looking at society IMO. I can't think of a better way when it comes to policy proposals that will impact a lot of people.

Overall, I'm kind of surprised how vitriolic Block's paper was. It read a lot like a Reddit debate....."

The woman is a fully formed person and has all the rights and privileges that come with that. The fetus is not a fully formed person and does not have these things. Her rights supersede its. She has the right to bodily autonomy and can't be forced to carry a fetus to term, therefore she has the right to abort. It has nothing to do with your analogy and it is not a child.

I can't eat when I first get up, so I take my breakfast to work and eat it at my desk. My two favourite breakfasts that are actually good for you are:

- 1/2 cup quick oats soaked in 1/2 cup of milk (I use almond milk) with a scoop of protein (I use vanilla) and 1/2 cup of frozen berries on top. I usually mix the oats and leave out the berries, and let that sit and soak as I get ready, then throw the berries on top before I leave for work, and eat it all when I get there.

- Smoothy with 1 scoop protein, 1 cup almond milk, 1 banana, 1 cup frozen berries. You can also add in greek yogurt (Liberte has great 0% fat stuff). Add in greens like Kale or spinach. If you wizz them up a bit with the liquid before adding the other solids they'll get super small and you can't taste it at all.


If you start out with one of those, you will likely be hungry by lunch and be craving something. Eat it! Once you get into a routine of actually eating food, then start thinking about meal planning."

finalDraft_v012,asianamerican,1390526657.0,"I dunno about that.  I've met a lot of well adjusted half Asians....they seem to do well, especially when they are immersed in Asian culture.  I grew up in a big family (90 people at our family reunions), and my future-son would be part of that.  I traveled to Asia a lot since childhood and it's greatly affected me, despite not being fluent in my family's native language.  What I mean to say is this: although I am Chinese by blood, I know there are things that separate me from foreign Chinese, and things that separate me from (for example) 6th gen Americans.  But there is nothing wrong with that, and that's something my mom had told me since I was little.  To take the best of both worlds and be someone strong.  That's something I want to encourage in my future kids as well, not just in a future son but my future daughter too.  Regardless of whether she is half or full blooded (if I break up with my boyfriend).

I feel like a lot of you guys are jumping the gun for some reason; you don't know my boyfriend, you don't know me, and you don't know the dynamics of our relationship.  I don't like the feeling of internet strangers calling me racist - it actually seems like you guys are the racist ones for having such a knee-jerk reaction, based off assumptions from a comment I made last year.  

Does anyone here even want a rational discussion?  Because I would be happy to talk.  But so far, reading the comments, I am not getting that feeling.  I seriously expected more from r/AsianAmerican, where there are so many posts about people who DO admit they are or were self-hating Asians."

• Military spending is a viable economic strategy, especially now that we are now the ass-kicking policeman of the world (see fantasy #2 above).

• We can cut taxes and still pay for all the government stuff we want to.

I'd never driven a car before but I supposed a golf cart would be a great practice, and it was pretty cheep to rent one so I got it for the day. The owner explained to me how it worked, but what he failed to mention (I guess he thought I should already know) was how hard I had to step on the gas. I almost ran over a Canadian tourist, a dog, after trying to escape the town I somehow ended on a horse field (why the hell was a horse field on that little island?), almost got a horse to knock me out and finally got stuck on the beach. When I managed to control it and take it to the hotel, I was parking it and crashed on another (private) cart. I broke the bumper. Luckily it was my last day of vacations so I duct-taped it and ran the hell out of that island. I haven't touched a motorised vehicle ever since.

D-47 is often considered a good choice for melomels, because it's supposed to bring out the fruit flavors very well. I've used D-47 with great success for that purpose.

I've had positive experiences with Red Star Champagne Pasteur. It seems to make a good sweet mead if you can cold crash at the desired gravity. I know one professional meadery that uses this strain heavily.

pretendent,gaming,1390527218.0,"I suppose they theoretically could. They don't take such measures though.

People also talk quite openly about their preferred VPN (Astrill for me), including, in one notable instance of my experience, a lower-ranked judge in the Chinese court system.

In China, I suspect it is the case that so long as VPN usage and access to the uncensored internet does not spread beyond Expats and highly educated Chinese, they won't take too many more steps to clamp down on the internet. The point being not to keep the Chinese people in the dark, but to make sure that a large majority gets its news from government friendly news-sources and not too much stability-threatening knowledge leaks through to everyone. 

They are much more interested in shutting down mass-communication than they are using VPNs. For instance, legislation passed last year which would it a crime to spread ""false information"" or ""rumors"" which were viewed at least 5,000 times or re-posted at least 500 times. False information and rumors should read as euphemisms for anything that government doesn't want people to talk about. 

Do you have information demonstrating that a government official is getting kickbacks from the companies he's supposed to regulate and interact with? If you tell too many people, it's jail for you, because such information would embarrass the Communist Party and threaten national stability.

Do you have proof that ethnic minorities are being discriminated against? That would be likely to cause separatist and ethnic anti-government riots, which would embarrass the Communist Party and threaten national stability. To jail with you.

The practices with questionable ethics that gave rise to the piecemeal standardization process which has finally somewhat stabilized over the past couple of decades were neither a new issue (there has been rampant scientific sexism, racism, ableism and homophobia since the beginning of the so-called field), nor an artifact of that era's academic industry per say.

Story time. Last year, Pokemon X and Y had fuzzy leaked images all over the web after they sent out review copies. Some were real and some were fake. It was obvious which were real and which fake though imo. All the fakes just used backgrounds from the official website or the trailers and then they pasted 2D drawings of fakemons and blurred the picture so you couldn't tell they were 2D. They WERE convincing enough though, they weren't the work of a half-assed MS Paint masterpiece, but you could tell where they got their source material from. Many people didn't believe the real leaks were real because they simply didn't like what they saw (sort of like how people have been saying ""she's not popular enough to be a character."" ""I don't even know who she is"" etc about the recent ssb4 ""leak""), even though there were no signs of the real leaks being tampered with in Photoshop. Weeks later the games come out and every doubter was proven wrong.

What did that have to do with anything? Well this is how I see it... these Palutena leaks look incredibly real and aren't as blurry as the fakes  for X and Y, and on top of that they show no signs of people photoshoppping preexisting screenshots together to create fake images. (Which is how you photoshop things. You don't just press a button and an amazing 3D model magically appears on the screen. You either take prexisting art and shop it in, or make the art and shop it in, then blur it to hide any signs of the band-aid tool or whatever.) It's pretty unblurry as well and Palutena's model is nothing like any of her 3D models ever shown before, and it certainly isn't a 2D drawing. When I look at the ""leaks"" they just look so convincingly real and I see no reason to doubt them. 

BUT the keyword there is I ""SEE"" no reason to doubt them. Visually they check out okay. But logically this makes no sense. Who's leaking them? Why? Is it a rogue developer who's doing it for kicks? There's certainly no review copies out yet which is how Pokemon got leaked early. It doesn't add up and this is why I won't believe it's 100% real yeeeet.

There's some theories about how since Namco is making it instead of a studio that's closely tied to Nintendo, it'd be easier for them to let info out. Does Namco have a history of leaks or something? I dunno! 

The other theory is that the Nintendo Direct coming soon will announce something about early playable demos for Smash Bros 4 being released soon. Remember the Brawl demo that featured new fighters like Pokemon trainer and Dedede that came out way before they finished the game? http://bulbanews.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Brawl_demo_featured_at_Whobby_2008 This seemed to happen a couple of months before Brawl finally was released, so if history repeats itself, this would make sense. However this theory is just guesswork made up by fans. We don't even know if there's a Nintendo Direct soon and we certainly don't know anything about a demo coming out, so there's just no evidence. But if they do announce a demo or something next direct, then the ""logic"" of this ""leak"" makes so much more sense. But until then, logically I don't see who is doing the leaking and WHY would they bother?"

It doesn't disappear.

So, say you use some more resources, say you use all 10, the tempest will now have -6 attack, because the 4 attack it had due to redesign has had 10 taken away from it. I believe this to be the reason Tempest doesn't get the ""full attack"".

Oh, just in case you didn't know, negative attack values aren't shown in game, all you see is 0, even though the actual attack value is a negative number. (Can be proven with languid on a 1 attack creature, then using crimson bull. If you do this you will see the attack is returned to 1)

Maybe there is something in their instinct that understands that a sick dog will disappear and not come back. The fact that after a while no one in the family will carry the scent of the dog that died and it won't smell the scent outside anywhere would probably mean your other dog somewhat understands that it is gone.

Have you actually used Bing recently?  I realize it's a joke to many people, but that's mostly because it sucked for so long.  Well, it doesn't suck anymore.  

For one thing, Bing doesn't censor porn results - unlike Google.  For another thing, you can still use the ""+"" operator on Bing - unlike Google.   And Bing's image search in particular is just incredible.

Ten years ago, I would have said that no search engine had a chance against Google.  Nowadays, I feel like there's a small opening.  Google has made some questionable UI decisions, they've disabled features, killed off popular products, become a bloated portal, forced Google+ onto everyone, etc.  In short, Google has become arrogant.  

If Google keeps it up, people might feel motivated to step outside the bubble.  And when that happens, they'll discover that Google's competitors have been working twice as hard just to survive.  That's when Google will be screwed."

How many guys are popular enough to get voted in as a starter over all others at their position and don't deserve getting into the ASG at all? People complain about Rondo getting so many votes and yet it's irrelevant because he won't actually get the bid.

Kobe is a superstar among superstars, the only one who matches his sheer popularity is LBJ. Of course there are more deserving players who should get the bid but this isn't something that will happen often. Usually if a player gets voted as a starter on name alone, then that player most likely would at least be worthy to be a reserve. Think Blake Griffin. Even someone as popular as Shaq wasn't getting into the ASG when he didn't deserve it. Pretty much Kobe and LBJ are the only logical exceptions to this rule in the current NBA (KD might join this rank as well although by jersey sales, sponsorships, and being known by the general population*, he's not there yet.)

pat5168,DebateReligion,1390527619.0,"Do you think that those descriptions were meant to be taken literally? When I read ""his bones are like bars of iron"" I think that it's only trying to convey that it's one tough mother. It's similar to the descriptions in the Iliad: when Ajax is described as having a shield made of seven oxhides, it's understood to be hyperbole. I won't use that to argue with you, it's just that I think that if you're going to say that the description means that the Leviathan was literally made of stone and metal, then it's only consistent to extend that logic to mean that Ajax was a giant or superhuman. Correct me if this accusation is false, but it seems to me that you imply a very low level of creativity for ancient authors: they need to observe something that combines the qualities of fire, rocks, metal and smoke in order to assign them together in the character of a fantastical creature when each of those characteristics could be observed from much more common and individual sources."

Backstory: I was 14, it was secondary school and I was friends with this girl, let's call her Jane. Jane was pretty slutty with everyone, but she had a boyfriend. He didn't mind she was like that and I was the first one to find out why.

So, anyway, I was fooling around with her one day and she told me she wanted to give him a blowjob but she'd never done it before. I said ""well, why don't you practice with me? You won't get disappointed"". I was just kidding, I never really thought she'd accept, so I was pretty surprised when she said ""really? all right then, is Friday ok to you?"" I was astonished but it was a golden opportunity, so I naturally said yes.

Friday came and I was nervous as hell. She went to my house (my family was out) and we started just chatting, then we made out for a bit. Jane told me to unzip my pants and I did; she grabbed my junk over the boxers and she blushed, red as a tomato. I was sitting on the couch; she knelt in front on me and when she took out my penis...

She screamed. ""OMG what is that????"" she yelled. She was as blushed as someone can be and didn't stop pointing at it. I didn't know what to say. ""That's... well, what you're supposed to, you know..."" She was freaked out. ""I thought it would look different!!! Hide it, hide it!!!"" so I did. I put my boxers and my pants back on and she started to calm down. she sat on a chair, breathed for a minute and then ran to wash her hands and left without even saying goodbye. A few weeks ago she talked to me again; she apologised and she told me she didn't give her guy a BJ either. After that incident she stopped being slutty, and she always blushed when she saw me. I haven't seen her in years but I heard a rumour saying he had a girlfriend now.

michaelnoir,AskMen,1390527780.0,"Two things, one biological and the other socio-economic.

The dating and mating game is a highly assymetrical one. In most of nature, the pattern is male competition and female selection. It varied with humans, but they often follow this pattern too. Given the sheer numbers involved, it follows that some men will not be selected, and that the number of unselected men will be more than the number of unselected women, given the relative cheapness of sperm and rarity of eggs. I hate to put it in such crude terms, but that's what it amounts to. The men who are unselected by women often make the understandable mistake of taking personally what is, after all, only statistics. A desirable male will often be selected by more than one female, as anyone will have noticed who gets a girlfriend and suddenly becomes more attractive to women. 

The other reason is socio-economic. Women these days don't have to settle down and have children if they don't want, and don't have to depend on a man to provide them with a house and income. They can work, travel, not get married, have freer relationships, and as a result relationships in general tend to become more unstable and short-term. 

The net effect of both of these things is to leave a sort of surplus of men. It isn't fair but I don't think much can be done about it. "

Shmaesh,politics,1390527783.0,"Wait. Wait. Wait. 

Before you move the goal posts, let's go back to this 'natural rights' argument. I prefer to beat you on your own ground.

You're saying that if I become pregnant, my body is no longer mine to control? Why? Because I had sex? 

Why does a man or a post-menopausal woman have more rights than I do in this regard? An accident of ovum? 

Are you saying that by having sex, I am effectively putting one of my kidneys up for auction and public use? How?

What if I didn't consent to sex?

What if I *know* that, once birthed, my fetus would not survive for more than a few, agonizing minutes *at best*, then die?

What if I consented to sex, but I have any number of chronic/progressive diseases which make it probable that either the fetus or I will die during pregnancy?

What if I carry genes for conditions which would mean my child is destined for a short, insensate life of pain and suffering due to a terminal condition then die?

Am I still obligated to allow someone to use my kidneys for nine months if it might kill us both?

If any of the above three you answer 'still must gestate that fetus' to, is your advice then that people with hereditary conditions and serious illness remain celibate?

How is that recommendation not, then, infringing on other people's 'natural rights' yourself?"

Besides that she was actually violent. She almost assassinated Warhol and Amaya. Warhol had open heart surgery and barely survived, IIRC.

That's in the past though, and feminism is now mainstream and moderate.

Admittedly, there are some pretty radical MRAs now, but none of them that violent, AFAIK. If the movement actually gains traction and becomes mainstream, I imagine it would be a lot more moderated as well. This is why I don't really pay much heed to the bitching about the MRM.

gobberpooper,Terraria,1390528091.0,"It has a very mature sense of humor, much much higher quality than slapstick driven kids shows. The characters are very well done, and they're all very memorable. The show is extremely absurd and silly, he'll be walking up a hill and then he finds a family of miniature beards in a candy corn house. That type of random creativity is expected yet unexpected. There's a lot of good songs, and some of the episodes can be very deep and thought-provoking. It also just has a very calming atmosphere in general. When you're having a lazy/hangover Sunday, throw it on and you'll find it relaxing. Unlike My Little Pony (ughhh) or Regular Show, the show has no specific appeal towards any gender or age group. The colorful world and silliness appeals to children, the humor and deep lines appeal to adults, the princess is a bold scientist and the hero is an unrelenting badass. Something for everyone, and nothing that's just for one group.

But honestly, I don't think Star Citizen is going to necessitate a real spacecraft THC. You'll need your usual fixed-wing flight controls, A yaw axis, and a few buttons for switching flight mode between simulated-fixed-wing and newtonian (full-inertial) flight. If you really want translational control, you can just map that to a hat switch. I've found that really helpful in Lunar Flight.

She wasn't a good artist and couldn't accept that, so she taught art to little kids. It's related but it's not what you want to do. It doesn't use your art knowledge or your artistic brain.

I remember the episodes when she was coming into this job. It was a big ""A-HA!"" moment for her I think when she could use her art knowledge towards curating and art dealing. It's much MUCH more related to her original dream, she still does the same things and interacts with the same artistic world, it's just not her work that's selling. (Plus, if she gets her name out there and makes enough contacts, she'd get a gallery show easily enough and then bam-dream achieved.)

TotallyNotSuperman,whowouldwin,1390528154.0,"On this subreddit, it really has died down. Before, the most vocal people really did ascribe to the belief that Batman would win fights by virtue of being Batman. The subreddit even had a rule in the sidebar that said Batman would always win.

Now, people are far more aware of his limitations. Many people argued against the ""Because Batman"" way of thinking.

Here's a run-down of reasons people have given for ""Batman always wins"":

* He came up with functional plans to beat the individual JLA members.
* He has demonstrated obsessive planning for extremely unlikely situations.
* He has found ways to make even Darkseid back down.

Reasons people disagree:  

* He never had a plan to stop beings like Darkseid. Final Crisis gave him the tool to do so at the beginning of the series, and he was told what it was and what it did. He fought Darkseid for years and only won in the end due to being in the right place at the right time.  
* *Secret Files* showed some of Batman's contingency plans, and not all were completed. He didn't know how to non-lethally beat Atom, and just didn't have enough info on any of the New Gods to win. So it's obvious ""If he knows of you, he knows how to beat you"" is simply not true.  
* Batman has never demonstrated the ability to will a GL ring to himself, out-invent/reprogram the likes of Brainiac, get access to the Central Battery of Oa, and the like. So thinking he has infinite access and knowledge relies on the ""common knowledge"" that he can do it, with nothing to back it up.

(Thank you to Thrice_Berg for correcting my formatting.)

Like other people have said, Batman usually loses because people have heard he's able to compete with everyone. So, in an effort to challenge him, they match him up with people who he has no place fighting."

I smiled and stood beside her as she got married, and I'm nothing but encouraging now, even as they continue to have bonehead disagreements and realize that they don't even know each other that well.

frackaracka,worldnews,1390528290.0,"&gt; Not all of India is Hindu so the puja comment you made is off base.

Um, the predominant religion is Hinduism, so it's not off-base at all. Should I have included that Muslim women are urged to change their clothes before going to pray in a mosque if their female baby has urinated on them - but if it's from a male baby, then it's okay to not change? As if bodily fluid from a female baby was inherently more impure than a male's. It's the same concept at work.

&gt; Next you mention skin color, you do realize almost all cultures revere light skin.

Asian cultures place a premium on light skin, but tan skin is considered beautiful in Western cultures. Racism is also a woefully under-addressed issue in India: http://www.countercurrents.org/bono220114.htm

&gt; Thirdly you mention being glued to your family as a tourist in India, how's that different from most places you visit as a tourist?

I don't visit other places with my family. I don't have to. That's the difference. I've traveled to a number of developed countries by myself without ever having to worry about my safety as a woman.

&gt; Can you really argue that women aren't more vulnerable than men?

That's not the question being discussed. No place is crime-free but there's a lot more freedom and less fear for a woman in a Western city. Women are safer in Western cities than they are in Indian cities. Period."

So we went, and while waiting for our food, my boyfriend pulled out this tacky (but I secretly like that) bright red heart.  The kind full of chocolate.

""That's part 1 of your gift,"" he said.

I smiled and put it away.  I'm not a huge fan of chocolate.  Throughout dinner, he kept trying to nudge me towards opening.  ""Don't you wanna try a piece?""  I kept saying I would try some after dinner...so he eventually then said...

""Okay, then I'M gonna have one!  Give me a piece!""

I smugly pulled out the heart and opened it.  Then I snapped it shut, eyes wide.  I opened the thing slowly again....and dead center in the heart, there was a **pink Nintendo 3DS XL**!!!!!!  I squealed so badly.  He got it all on video, but I don't feel comfortable about posting that here.  It's such a cool present!!!  And it turns out, the entire reason he wanted to do an early Valentine's dinner (it was technically end of January when we did this) was so that I could have the 3DS before the new Fire Emblem came out on Feb. 4!!  He knew I was a huge fan of the series!  I suppose that was no secret, since 90% of what we talk about is games.  What I thought was even cooler was that he had set it all up for me already...saving me like an hour of downtime...and downloaded a bunch of demos from the eShop for me to try out.

He later posted the video on Facebook, much to my embarrassment. 

But even cuter, I think, is the thought of him eating the center chocolates and carving out a slot for the 3DS in the heart."

lumpking69,roguelikes,1390528643.0,"I'll tell you a true story, op! 

One day I was at work. It was late, maybe 10pm. I was outside having a smoke and trying to make it last as long as possible to avoid going back in. My job in dead smack between the suburbs and an industrial area, so you see lots of werid animals roaming around because they are displaced. 

I once saw a very pretty fox just casually walk past me. Bushy tail on that fucker too. Had a racoon explode out of the trash and scare the shit out of me. I also witnessed a hawk of some sort catch, kill and eat a pigeon. I heard a very loud WHACK and when I turned around, I peep a fucking hawk just ripping the feathers out of a pigeon. Lots of flapping and blood all over the floor. Gotta love nature. Well, you don't always have to love it. 

Anywho, I'm outside having my smoke. When I see the prettiest black cat I have ever seen in my life. It was black and almost had a shiny coat. It very quickly scurried under a co-workers car. So I got down on my knees and started to call the kitty. I wanted it to come out, maybe I could give it a little petting love. But I couldn't see the poor little fucker. 

So I got even close to the car. I'm almost underneath it now. I look and look and then I spot the son of a bitch. Hes sorta hidden behind one of the tires, so I can only really see his tail. What a wonderful and fluffy tail it had too. I had never seen a cat with white streaks in in tail like that befor. Thats when it hit me. Not just the fact that it wasn't a cat and indeed a fucking skunk... the smell hit me. 

I must have spooked the shit out of the skunk cause it decided to turn ass and spray me. I caught me on my right arm and right side of my chest. So at this point I am very much in shock. From the moment i saw his tail and realized it was a skunk and got sprayed, a good 5 seconds must have passed. Blink of an eye type thing. 

So I stand up and the smell hits like a ton of bricks. My eyes almost burned a bit, like someone cut an onion. I was gagging, angry and confused. My cigarette was still lit and in my hand, so I just threw it on the ground. I took my hoodie off and tied to escape the stink. But there was no escaping that shit. 

I had no idea what to do. I couldn't go back into the workplace cause I would fucking kill everyone and they would have to shut the place down. So I tried to wave at the security cameras to see if I could get anyone to come out, but no one was paying attention. So I decided to ring the bell like a mad man. That would get them to come out for sure. So I start buzzing and buzzing. 

Eventually one of the girls gets annoyed and they march out ready to chew my head off for ringing the bell like an asshole. She swings the door open, ready to start bitching at me, but the smell hits her and she instantly shuts the fuck up. 

She runs back inside, I'm hoping shes going to get some water and towles or something, but no. She just got the rest of the company to come outside and have a good laugh at me. 

So now the entire company is outside and having a good time at my expense. I try to laugh it off, but it was really embarrassing. I was so mad. 

Eventually I tell them to call my mom cause she had a pickup truck. I jumped in the back and hosed myself off in her backyard. I got the stink off. But I had a really hard time walking into the office again after that. I got my balls busted for a good couple of months. 

Thats the story OP! Hope its worth a prize!"

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390528660.0,"So, your measurements actually point to 30F/FF or 32E/F in bands that run tighter.  

The first thing to understand is that cupsize is a ratio, not an absolute.  Because it's determined by the difference between your bust and underbust, when you move between band sizes, you need to adjust cup sizes to maintain the same volume.  A 32D is actually the same volume as a 30DD, but with a larger band size.  

That said, your measurements indicate both would be rather too small for you.  Are you scooping and swooping?  It makes a huge difference.

If a 32DD looked too big for you even after a thorough swoop and scoop, then the issue is likely shape. A shape mismatch can cause gaping or quadboob just as easily as can the wrong size.  There's an excellent guide on shape in the sidebar, I suggest you take a look!"

I can tell you that one of the most important things for you is going to be finding answers to problems you encounter. Google is an amazing tool for this. If your google-fu is strong, you can find the solution to damn near any problem, or at the very least a method to find that solution.

The other thing that has really helped me out was learning Powershell. It is...well, powerful. The amount of time it has saved me with automating repetitive tasks alone (not to mention removing human error) has made it worth learning. And it is surprisingly easy to learn too! I took a single C++ course at a community college a few years before starting to learn powershell, so I had a bit of background with scripting, but even so it is still pretty simple to learn (though I'm still learning new things I can do with it all the time).

Problem is, according to the [usual trade value chart](http://www.draftcountdown.com/features/Value-Chart.php), the combined value of picks 30, 56, 61, 77, and 94 is about 1581, about enough for the 6th overall pick.  That's not enough for Clowney.  To get up to the Rams' 2nd overall pick takes another 1000 points, which takes next year's 1st and probably next year's 2nd as well.

So: we could draft 7 players in the first 3 rounds of the draft, filling many different needs in many different positions...

...or we could trade it all for one guy.  At a position where he can't really take over games.  JJ Watt is amazing, but it didn't stop the Texans from being terrible this year.  And its a position where, frankly, we're already doing pretty well.  Not that there isn't room for improvement, but its certainly not the position where we'd get the most bang for the buck.

If our roster was set at every other position, and all we needed was a franchise QB, and Andrew Luck was available, I could see giving up 7 picks to get him.  But that's really not the position the 49ers are in, so I think they'd be crazy to give up that much to trade up.  I think its very unlikely that we give up more than a 1st, a 2nd, and a 3rd to move up; and that only gets us to the edge of the top 10. And even then I think we'd rather do it for Watkins than for Clowney."

This is great advice, but my issue is when he starts claiming this ""unoffensibility"" is a Christ-like virtue. Take these quotes for example:

&gt;Our real goal was not to get spiritual help for ourselves but to seek revenge toward the one who offended us. How is such action not a manifestation of hatred? For an offended soul, cold love, betrayal and hatred are a walk into darkness.

&gt;Will you find more love, and hence, continue your growth toward Christlikeness? Or will you allow that offense to consume your spiritual life?

&gt;The offense taught us how others feel when they are ignored. Do you see this? You must make that offense become an opportunity to become more Christlike.

&gt; Lord, forgive me for being so easily offended and for carrying offenses. Father, my heart is foolish and weak. Grant me the unoffendable heart of Jesus Christ. Amen.

Just looking at Mark 3:29 and it is clear that if you insult or disrespect God, he will never forget or forgive you and commands that you be put to death. So my problem is the author claiming that being unoffendable is Christ-like, when the bible says otherwise."

I'm in favour of private property rights that acknowledge the history of property rights and how they weren't (and probably still aren't) fair.

Whether or not Insanity used in the title was just to give it an extra marketing push is debatable, but it's hard to argue that they aren't close enough to Insanity to be into the same family.  In fact, [Shaun T says here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yeu46PkUYto&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m20s), ""Asylum takes everything in Insanity, and makes you do it right.""  

They keep enough of the core of Insanity (intense cardio, focus on the core), while improving on the principles that made Insanity great and addressing the biggest complaints about the first one.  Additionally, it rounds itself much more than Insanity, especially volume 2.  The biggest complaint of Insanity was that there was 0 strength training, so Shaun T added Strength in A1.  Then in A2, you use weights in just about every video (and Upper Elite is much more cardio intensive than Strength).

I think if anything, a case could be made for a more refined, better planned, no equipment (or equipment optional/for advanced) Insanity 2.  While I really love Insanity and it's an amazing workout, fitness expert quickly point out it's flaws.  Shaun T misses things (Plyometric Cardio Circuit's warm up completely misses stretching on the left side after the left lunge).  I also read an article comparing P90X/Insanity/RushFit that explains that Insanity's stretches are the wrong type of stretches for the type of workout that Insanity provides.  Again, it's a great workout, but not without it's flaws.  

If you're looking for a sequel to Insanity though, you really should be looking at Asylum.  Now that I write this, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't call it a sequel."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390529212.0,"I don't really buy into the whole alpha/beta thing (other than for the sake of discussion in this subreddit), and I don't think the submissive/feminine men that I find attractive would even necessarily fit into the beta mold, nor are even mutually inclusive terms. Betas, as I understand, are pushovers, needy, and often unkempt with their appearance. Feminine men can be dominant, aggressive, cocky, sharply dressed. I'll reference the [Ruby Rhod](http://application.denofgeek.com/images/gb/ruby.jpg) character from The Fifth Element (who is straight and during one scene gives a woman an orgasm). [Japanese rockstars](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_GtKSFRpKnr8/TD3oSXDZzCI/AAAAAAAAAA4/9MyS5iKVoig/s1600/dir_en_grey.jpg) also come to mind. Also, submissive men aren't necessarily feminine. In the BDSM community, submissive men are often muscular and traditionally masculine. There is something incredibly attractive about having a strong, handsome, powerful man submitting to you. One of my favorite partners loved to massage my feet and paint my toenails, and loved to ask my permission to do so. He's 6'3'' and very tradionally good-looking. It was super hot.

Also, there can be a difference between someone who is submissive sexually and submissive in other ways, which I think is why TRP folks might assume that being submissive would make you a beta. When it comes to making decisions in a relationships and being an adult and having responsibilities, I think it's healthy to be equals."
