positmylife,relationships,1391044553.0,"You really need to go see a counselor or psychologist at the very least. Whatever your health condition is, it could be contributing to depression or anxiety. Laziness is one thing, your internal battles suggest something more. You're even anxious about your anxiety ruining the relationship. You need some help getting through this. You need to manage the anxiety to be able to tackle other things like asking your boyfriend if he's willing to take you to a painting class. I know since you're already avoiding things, this will be hard, but focus all your energy into going to a psychologist. It's ALWAYS easier than you think it will be. I've gotten in these tropes before where I want to do things but I just can't muster the will to do them. It really just comes down to forcing yourself to break the task into tiny steps and force yourself to take them one at a time. And I mean tiny steps. Like 1) get out of bed 2) open your laptop 3) search for providers in your area 4) pick one from the top 5 5) call the number 6) ask when the earliest available appointment is 7) make an appointment 8) write it down and confirm while still on the phone 9) hang up 10) call BF and ask if he'll take you to appointment 11) hang up 12) reward yourself for making an accomplishment, however small it may seem. Rewards are a big deal and reinforce your progress. Don't skip that step. I find a task is easier when you see it as small, easily done tasks than one big one with no framework to guide you. It's hard sometimes, but you can do it and it is the first step to getting better. "

loyyd,AskMen,1391044753.0,"I don't think it's fair to say the risk is very low for women compared to men and that women have it easier. There are things that women don't have to worry about with regards to taking the initiative such as being labelled a creep or a rapist or some such demonization but being rejected is the same for both genders. Both genders can be rejected harshly or cruelly instead of softly although I think it's less common for men in non-public/cold-approach situations as many women do anything and everything in their power to reject someone without actually rejecting them or directly saying no.

Women do have to deal with some men not being open to being the one who is approached but that's the exception and not the rule. Not all men want to be asked out by women either and there are definitely settings in which it's not desirable. Women have their own set of problems with regards to dating; no one has it easy in the world of dating (except for very attractive people but that has its own problems).

15 Jesus replied, “Let it be so now; it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John consented.

16 As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. 17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.”

""THIS IS MY SON; WITH WHOM I AM WELL PLEASED""

2) The entire trinity is present at Jesus' baptism...Also the tongues of fire at pentacost, John the Baptist said "" I baptize with water, the one who comes after me will baptize with the spirit"" if we accept that God the father is real and that Jesus is the son, and we have several accounts of the Holy Spirit, how can the trinity be false?

Nassor,PoliticalDiscussion,1391045047.0,"It's complicated. Firstly are we talking income inequality, wealth inequality, or economic inequality? On the surface they're the same thing but in reality they're all very different. Warren Buffet is the perfect example. He's the second richest person in the US however his life style is extremely modest. Outside of his stock assets he'd be considered upper middle class or on the bottom rungs of the ""wealthy"". This is his choice. He could very well be flying around in gold plated 747s but he chooses to be modest. The problem is his $58 billion in stocks don't reflect his personal modesty. Bill Gates is another example. He does live a fairly lavish life style but it isn't much more than Tom Brady who is married to a super model and has a mansion with a moat. Consider John Travolta who owns an airliner as a private jet. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet skew the statistics by a ridiculously large amount yet their lifestyles don't reflect this.

Income inequality is a better metric however it is skewed by those who have one year windfalls. What is most often cited are CEOs who make seemingly large amounts of money per year but when you dig deeper you'll notice this is often due to exercising stock options rather than their yearly income. Often celebrities and athletes can out earn high end CEOs because their income is from actual salaries rather than simply selling their stocks off.

Then there is economic inequality which is highly subjective but probably the most accurate metric. When you measure this you begin to realize the problem may be institutional ~~racism~~ societal issuses rather than economic classism. I do not believe it's fair to compare nations such as Japan which is extremely homogenous and almost entirely a single race. It's my opinion that economic inequality causing social issues is closer related to latent ~~racial~~ societal issues rather than straight economic classism.

I believe that the solution is not to take from the rich but rather find a way to raise poor into more stable economic situations. I feel that raw statistics on this subject ignore structural problems in societies. I don't know that simply redistributing wealth will fix structural societal problems. Long story short... It's complicated. "

For the other 2 (assuming you keep Graga Mal and that you have the 6th DOff slot), it depends what you want to do. RSP extensions (fabrication engineer) are always useful, there's warfare specialists for the various enemies, the debuff removing Warp core engineers are fun, Suliban Conn officers give you accuracy... work out what you want the ship to do, and then get the DOffs to suit it.

Then of course there are the more utility-centric DOffs. Astrometric Scis for TW cooldown or more particle traces, and Consultants to get more XP and CXP.

Dantilli,socialskills,1391045236.0,"You're at uni so go join societies that interest you, that's your best bet. Let your societies become your social circle. 

You can also just go to a bar and meet people, if you're in a student area most of the people you'll find there will also be students. There is probably a bar in your student union if you don't wanna go somewhere else on your own.

Meet people during lectures, you can actually get a good conversation in if you get to a lecture a bit early. Then you just invite them to drinks that evening and you're sorted. If they stick to themselves then fine, but you might as well try, I mean, you're going to the lectures anyway.

You can also just try talking to people randomly throughout the day. Say on the bus or people standing around (There always seems to be people just standing around near uni buildings...). People on cigarette breaks are another good one. 

Just be imaginitive and improvise. Look for as many opportunities as possible

Hope this helps :)

Edit: to move them from aquaintance to friend, **invite them to do something**. Whether it's just drinks or something, invite them. Even if it's your first conversation with them, if you think they're cool invite them to something. Create opportunities to be around them for more than just one or two small chats."

When they take your hand to shake it, grab it. Pull them in close, take a handful of their hair, and bring your face close to their head. Breathe in the scent of their hair as deeply, and as creepily as you can manage. I'm talking nostril-flaring, sinus-clearing, serious sniffing. Imagine you're doing a line of cocaine, off their hair.

On the out-breath, growl ""*MMMM, CINNAMON!*"" before letting them go.

I've tried a variety of tones and tastes, and the best creep-factor has gotta be ""Cinnamon"" with the same degree of relish you'd express when unboxing a firearm you've wanted for about 6 years. A deep-throated rasp.

If you want people to be terrified of you for *years*, this is what you do to them.

EDIT: A close second to the Cinnamon Scare is this:

When near your target, perform a similarly intense investigation of the smells around you. Make sure it's one long, audible nasal inhalation that cannot escape their notice.

Look accusingly at your target.

Say ""You smell like *peaches!*"" in a disgusted, accusatory manner. Imagine they've just told you they stomp on baby's hands for funsies.

strangestdude,RedPillWomen,1391045430.0,"FWIW there is a group of feminists who disagree with mainstream feminism called equity-feminists. Which is basically first wave feminism. 

They generally believe that men and women have temperament differences, and IMO is compatible with red pill social philosophy.

Here's an article from an equity-feminist showing studies that indicate temperament differences... http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/what-lean-in-misunderstands-about-gender-differences/274138/

I'm not a fan of mainstream feminism (I debate feminists regularly infact) but I hope people like yourself consider being a voice for women who feel alienated from mainstream feminism.

But that is why it is there. Benefactors realize that not everybody can pay that kind of money, and try to help others out. Nothing is wrong with that.

It really isn't the best they can do.

&gt; Annual visits to Israel help us maintain our ties to the country in a way that nothing else can. So, forced to decide between sending one child to day school for a year and bringing our entire family to Israel each year, we unreservedly choose the latter.

How can they say that going to Israel is more important than an actual Jewish education? Israel is over there, once a year. Judaism is here, now and always.

&gt;In short, our children are about as knowledgeable about their Judaism, and as comfortable in it, as any children we have ever met.

People with OCD can be very private about it, and not want to talk about whatever obsessions are bothering them. A lot of OCD sufferers find their fears and behaviors embarrassing, thus difficult to talk about.

And I can tell you my story is very, VERY similar to yours - My ex ""left me"" when she found out I figured out about some boy-toy she met on the interwebs. Kid was 18 (she was 24 or 25 at the time), a virgin, lived in his mom's basement, just graduated high school (band geek) grossly overweight, etc. In fact, I found out a while later that she went from the courthouse where she was awarded supervised visitation of our son to the bus station to pick up this kid after his 2 day trek half way across the country to see her about a month after we split up -- According to my sources, he left his virginity in a tent in Southeast GA. Gross.

So now, my friend, you are at a crossroads. Let's stop the feeling sorry for yourself and that you failed at life and address that. YOU didn't do anything wrong. YOU didn't fail. SHE failed. YOU seem like you are a loyal and loving man, and SHE is not a loyal and loving woman. So stop the pity party, man up and do what you already know what needs to be done. And what's that? Well if you can't live with her promiscuity, you're going to have to ""leave"". I don't mean leave the house per se, move into another room. Tell her you want a divorce. Tell her why.

As for the finances, you will find a way. It will suck for a while but you have to do what you need to do. You don't mention if you have kids, so I assume you don't -- and that's where it gets expensive. 

As far as the other guy, I can't say for sure but my money's on this guy is just ""not you"" and she's going to be a serial cheater the rest of her life using you as the ""good guy"" fall back. Single and 30 isn't as bad as you might think. A lot of people have baggage, but it's managable. It might not be their first rodeo and they have exes and kids and shit like that.. I met my fiancee when I was almost, moved in with her shortly after I turned 35 (moved 900 miles away from ""home"", I should point out). 

So yeah, it blows giant donkey balls, the TL;DR is that you need to decide for yourself what will make YOU happy based on the things you CAN control (finances, selling house as-is, getting divorce, etc) vs things you cannot (her behavior).

My suggestion is to start brushing your dogs teeth EVERY DAY. You can't use human toothpaste, but you can get dog toothpaste from pet stores.


Dental issues left to fester will only get worse and worse and worse, and it will soon cost you $1 000+. Also, a lot of vets will push these kinds of procedures on you because:


1) They obviously need to bring in sales, a vet clinic is a business, BUT THEY DO CARE! I worked in a clinic, and they love your animals as much as you do.


2) People don't always the advice of vets and brush their dogs teeth, and dental problems will get worse and cost a lot more than it initially does. 


The easiest way to keep dental issues at bay is to brush your dogs teeth, brush them well. Google how to do it properly and be religious about it. Raw diet also helps, I don't have to clean my dogs teeth because her diet does it for me, but I'm always prepared to do it if necessary. 


**EDIT**

A dogs mouth affects it's whole life, and should be taken incredibly seriously. Rotten teeth can lead to infection, they could be suffering even if they can chew through a bone or a steak. An animal has to eat. 


You also don't know if your dog has broken teeth, the only way to find out is to take radiographs, and no vet in their right mind would do that on a dog that's not sedated. "

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1391045733.0,"I think age has a lot to do with it. Younger customers predominantly hold minimum wage jobs and those funds have to stretch bi-weekly. I would assume many of them don't save as much as they would like to and it determines how frequently they tip and what amount they give. 

My older sister tips low and she was a waitress (also hostess) for a few years - she definitely knows the etiquette. She doesn't believe her contribution (tip) makes a big difference. Oddly enough, she feels she's  busting her butt at her current job and thinks other people don't work quite as hard. Her poor tipping might have to do with lacking empathy for other people's situation. However,  she will tip higher if there's been conversation between her and the waitress/waiter.

My parents always tip 15%-20% and that's how I was raised. I don't usually eat at a restaurant without knowing I have  surplus money for extra orders and tips. 

I always tip my hairdresser. Why? Because I only get it cut and styled (w/ eyebrows) once a month or two. It's a skill and I like to show my appreciation. Because it's something I can't do for myself. On a $24 charge, I always tip $10 ($20 around holidays). 

I'd probably tip $5-$10 if a hotel bellman brought up my luggage. Housekeeping I would not think to tip. 

Never stiffed anyone. But one time, I paid in coins because they were rude and wouldn't stop talking with the other waitress long enough to bring over my food that was *visibly* getting cold on the counter.    "

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1391045794.0,"&gt;You seem to be delusional on what women want. People want rights, and being beautiful has never given you the right to vote, abortions, use birthcontrols, equal opportunities, inheritance rights, laws protecting you from rape withing the marriage etc etc forever and ever.
Beauty is not power.

Wrong. 

Beauty **is** power. Beauty is the prime and most powerful of all powers. Your argument hinges on the will of attractive women, who are already getting the best deal possible, to rock the boat in favour of harder done by women, which is not a practical premise for an logically coherent argument. 

The equivolent argument would be trying to propose that the hyper rich 1% should take a vested interest in the tax rate of the poor....they're already rich. Who cares? Until their mansion is liquidated and their assets seized because the poor can no longer afford to buy whatever good or service they provide, they will do exactly nothing. 

Feminism is a social movement creating an overtone characterized by the perpetuation of victim mentality amongst otherwise perfectly equal or otherwise advantaged individuals (women) for the purposes of accruing social, political, and judicial privileges for women at the detriment of men due to a spiteful, though expected reaction to their poor performance in socially Darwinian meritocracies, hence why most vehement feminists are ugly, and/or haggered old women.

&gt;Of course they have considered it. Most decided it was bullshit.
So just because a black man became president, anyone can do it? You must be seriously blind to social factors if you think so. Just because a few people made it doesn't mean everyone is out of the woods yet.

Nope. Women earn 54% of the bachellors degrees in America and make up a significantly tiny population of the STEM fields. On the other hand, Biology(nursing), women graduate on equal par to men, yet, men only occupy 9.6% of America's nursing staff in America.

Why?: Because men don't want to be nurses...women do. Women don't do these things because they don't want too. Women are the ""fairer"" sex, therefore, they choose ""fairer"" careers. 

Furthermore, women make up appx. 30% of the MBA graduates in America, yet make up almost 15% of the corporate board room in Fortune 500 companies. That's a very good return for women...you can't possibly pretend ""The Man"" is holding you back.

Dysalot,MapPorn,1391045795.0,"I can go into a bit of detail about Nebraska. A snow day greatly depends on when the snow is coming. If we got a foot of snow but it ended at 8pm there would likely be class the next day as the roads would be somewhat cleared. This is in a city. The heads of the district would meet or call each other at about 5am and would determine the conditions and forecast. If the roads were travel-able there was class (and assuming there wasn't a forecast for a bunch of snow during the day.

One of the biggest factors for snow days aren't accumulation but drifting. In the plains it is quite windy, and 6"" of snow can easily drift several feet high in spots. Another is the district. Rural districts have to call snow days sooner and for less snow because students may have to travel quite long distances to get to class. Also, add in that rural students can drive at 14, and many rural roads aren't cleared quickly and don't have a lot of traffic.

Cold days are generally called for very low windchill (during the commute to class). Back when I was in school it was anything sustained below -25 to -30F, again this is for the safety of students walking to class. I wouldn't say they were more common than snow days but they did happen."

You might also want to include a ""living maze"" in the tunnels. Take the story of Persues and the Minotaur as inspiration. Except the maze keeps changing, and the minotaur equivalent (which should be intelligent, so not a spawn) is in control of how it changes. You can do it as combat, or something shifty that requires tracking/chasing.  

You could put in a daemon-possessed mirror that shows the players each something different. Some their greatest desire, some are morphed into horrors. For some, it might grant a minor wish/boon in starting the process of becoming a sorcerer (the means of getting their greatest desire?). It will try to possess psykers. For others, it might just require them to maintain their sanity. One person just shouldn't appear, which should be noticeable (and the daemon screwing with them).

That pushed me over the edge, making the tears fall, then stream. We'd end up with an Alice ""pool of tears"" situation, because having a 'problem' *was* my problem. It was a vicious cycle, and I wasn't forgiving myself. *Specifically, I was indulging in not forgiving myself! 

It took me awhile to recognize the self-sabotage that was happening, but when I realized what triggered my spiral, I was able to control it. If it's not a good time to cry, I'll redirect my thoughts (Ti specifically) to productively analyze an aspect of the situation at hand that I know won't induce feelings of hopelessness, fear, shame or inadequacy. 

In other words, I focus on ""what's happening,"" ""can do"" and ""now"" instead of ""can't,"" ""didn't,"" ""failed,"" ""why"" and ""what if?"" Etc. I know Ni is working whether I want it to or not (it's probably what's irritating my Fe and stifling my Se), but I need to avoid a Ni-Ti/Fe loop and instead engage Ti-Se, so I get moving again, on track. 

(If that paragraph is greek, check out [the cognitive processes](http://www.cognitiveprocesses.com/Cognitive-Functions/index.cfm).) 

But I also tell myself that it's OK to be deeply affected by something, it's OK to want better, it's OK to express it, and it's OK to take a break to work through that expression privately; we don't have to be on perfect display all the time, or immediately know what the 'right' action or reaction is. If I tear myself up over it, it'll just take longer. 

I like how you started your post with ""on a journey — my end goal is""; visualizing the outcome I want to achieve really helps me take the right steps. Nowadays I try hard to contain my self-bashing and doubting to one day, and go to sleep feeling positive about the steps I'll take tomorrow.

wordserious,explainlikeimfive,1391046159.0,"first, a distinction: closed source and open source are legal fictions. They are a matter of license, not of computer code. Typically, open source licenses allow you to use, modify, and copy a program, while closed source allow you to use it within certain limits.

Now for the hard part. A computer only understands object code, which is a sequence of numbers that, when interpreted by the computer, result in the expected behavior of the program. It is extremely hard for humans to modify a program in this state. Since a program can be made to protect itself (for instance by looking for a license file), and since it's hard to modify (or even read and understand) object code, this is used by software companies to prevent unauthorized use of their product.

Open source programs are distributed in source code, which is typically written in a high level computer language, something that humans can understand and manipulate. Source code, however, cannot be directly understood by a computer; it must first be translated into machine language, object code.

So typically open source allows you access to the source code, which makes easy to modify, distribute, copy the program, while closed source distributes only object code, which makes it very hard to do those things.

Regardless of these technical differences, however, if a program's license says that you cannot modify, copy, redistribute it, then you legally are not allowed to do those things. Even if you gain access to their source code, it would still be illegal to do those things. Illegal, but easy, which is why many software companies close access to their source."

**photos**

You're only wearing glasses in two photos, in one of those you are the ice king and in the other the label is still on your new glasses.   When you first meet someone are you more likely to be wearing glasses or not?  Let the answer to that guide your choice of main profile picture.  I like your new glasses and think they are supercute on you, but if you're not wearing them all the time move picture down to a secondary picture.

Good job on including the obligatory ""this is what my listed body type translates to in the real world"" picture.. but I think the dark color and lighting is combining to hide your shape a bit and actually making you look larger than you are.  Certainly not a bad picture or a great distortion of your shape, I just suspect you can do better.

**self summary**

first paragraph.. stellar.. fairly quick view into your personality and puts ""who you are"" out there in a nice positive light.

second paragraph is a mixed bag of who I am and who I am looking for in a date.  Try to separate those and leave the who I am up here in your self summary, and move who you are looking to date down to message me if.

**doing with my life**

excellent blend of what you are doing now, how it might lead toward what you want to be doing all with a bit of good humor thrown in for spin.. and some good hooks to start conversations off of.

I'd move the aquarium/terrarium creating/hoarding down to things you are good at.

**Good at**

I'd put aquarium/terrarium creating/hoarding first, then keep the current contents as the second paragraph.   

again.. good information, good hooks, nicely written.   You may want to break it into 2 paragraphs for some white space/ease of reading.

**notice**

Good.. maybe the poofy hair first and the other parts as they get to know you, but it works as written.

**favorites**

Excellent formatting and organization, kudos for adding a game section.

**six things**

Good list..  Jeggings?? (sorry showing my age here)

**thinking about**

If you're going to gain superpowers I recommend getting hit by lightening, struck by a radioactive isotope or even getting bit by a radioactive spider over getting dumped in a vat of acid.. that's never a good origin story.  Considering your hobby.. bitten by your newly bred letter w?

Else.. excellent.

Nice possibilities.. easy for a date to envision themselves participating in those things with you.

**private things** 

Good.. but perhaps your definition of pansexual is a little optimistic about who/how attractive to your the reader might be.. and how literally they take what you wrote.  

**message me if** 

Nothing stellar, nothing terrible, but do add the bits from your self summary that are more about the person you'd like to meet.

**overall** 

Your profile redo is pretty excellent, you could ignore everything I've written and still have a great profile.   This critique is pretty much my stream of consciousness as I read through your profile, hopefully some of it is helpful."

The USB entry and office applications are a huge advantage when comparing to the ipad and the low weight, bigger screen and autonomy when comparing to the pc make it perfect to use on my daily commute.

Two things you'll have to take into consideration if you are uncertain whether to choose rt or pro:

1) Do you need to install applications? At the moment the ones available from the store are limited although they are growing in number and quality. If you do you are better of with SP2

2) If your mind is set on the pro version you have to take into consideration that due to the higher power consumption it won't last as long as the RT( It takes me 2 days to need to recharge it, don't know the numbers on the pro) Also remember that different memory capacities come with different amounts of RAM."

As I have aged through my 20's I find myself thinking more frequently and more seriously about the people I come from, the people that make up who I am.

I think a lot about my grandparents, and my parents, and my extended family.

It is interesting to think about how I am like them and different from them, and what makes people alike and different.

I can't use any of them as a perfect model, but it helps me figure out how to do things in my life better, based on what works for them.

Especially for physical things, like what types of food and exercise work for us, and what doesn't, but also random interests, like particular books, or thoughts we ponder.

There is a moment of connection I have talking to my father, or mother, when they describe an experience they had, and I KNOW what they are saying. I can feel beyond their words and know intimately what they describe, because I have had that EXACT same experience. 

Those moments are really cool. And give me goosebumps.

And I wonder, just how far back in my ancestry could I go and find someone who has thought exactly as I think in a given situation.

Russian_Surrender,changemyview,1391046794.0,"You make a lot of reasonable arguments and rational points.  However, you're failing to recognize why age is used in establishing the law.  And age-based law (drinking, driving, working, etc.) that are designed to protect children are going to protect *some* children, but they are going to fail to protect others and even oppress others.  **The line between protection and oppression is thin.**

The age thresholds in these laws don't exist because there is anything ""magical"" about that age:  No rational person would argue that a person is 100% incapable of consenting to sex today and 100% capable tomorrow because an annual anniversary of their birth passed over that 24 hour period.  **The age thresholds exist in these laws because, without them, enforcement is unmanageable**&gt;; and society has determined that the ages that have been established protect the *most* children while minimizing the number of children who are either oppressed by the law or left unprotected by the law.

Certainly, society should be passing laws to protect the most vulnerable members against those who may want to take advantage of them (whether in a sexual manner or some other manner).  So we certainly need laws that prohibit these predatory behaviors.  The only question is how to define what does, and does not, constitute predatory behavior.  Society has determined that chronological age will be used to make that determination.  You argue that some other method (that you don't define) should be used.

While there may be other methods available that are more *reliable* in determining an individuals intellectual preparedness for sex (test, psychological evaluation, judicial review, etc.), none of those methods are anywhere near as efficient as using chronological age.  This efficiency is important to society because it minimizes the financial cost of enforcing and prosecuting the laws.

**TL;DR**:  Your premises and conclusions are mostly accurate.  What you fail to realize is that the only reason age is used to legally determine an individual's intellectual capacity for sex is because using that method is simple, efficient and unambiguous.  Your position doesn't address that fact at all."

yourpants,wow,1391046953.0,"Well, in the game right now, Orgrimmar is populated with Kor'kron war forces (basically Garrosh's army). They don't hurt you or anything, but you can see the way they terrorize the citizens and force merchants into combat training. They are technically ""friendly"" insofar as you can't attack them outside of the raid because until you enter the raid, time is frozen in that particular moment before the siege (as it is with any expansion when it comes to quests and characters; the Argent Tournament is a perfect example of something that technically ended long ago but still continues for the players to see). However this is the first time something like this has actually changed in a capital city during the expansion, so new or returning players tend to be confused by the odd names walking around the city since it all demands context to be understood.

My point is that, up until the raid, you are not considered a traitor and therefore not an enemy of the True Horde. So, in a sense, the Horde character you play is a member of Garrosh's Horde whether you dislike him or not (which some people do not; when it comes to roleplaying, that's entirely up to you).

tl;dr No, there are not two separate Hordes to play as, only one.

When it comes to the Pandaren, Ji Firepaw was a leading monk figure on The Wandering Isle, which is literally a floating turtle island in the middle of the ocean and the Pandaren starting zone. It's been isolated from civilization for centuries until one day (coincidentally about the same time the shrouding mists around Pandaria evaporated, which has never been fully explained but there are some theories) a vessel crashes into the Isle, gravely wounding the turtle and forcing the once stagnant Pandaren into action. Through a series of events that are played out in the quest line and some cinematics, Firepaw makes a rough decision that seriously schisms his relationship with Aysa Cloudsinger, another Pandaren monk who up to this point had similar values to him. But the unexpected crash coerced them to both make the final judgments on what they truly believed in due to the events on the isle, and unfortunately their differences were too great to mingle anymore. When you finish the quest line, a final quest offers you the decision between choosing either the Horde or the Alliance. Firepaw and Cloudsinger have decided to join the Horde and Alliance respectively, and because this is at the start of the overarching storyline, Firepaw has no idea what's in store for him. Spoiler alert: it's not fun.

Here's the window that pops up to finish the quest: http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78855/2179439-Pandaren_Choose_Your_Destiny.png

Up until that point, your character is completely neutral, and admittedly the choice can be tough for a newcomer. Great storytelling on Blizzard's part."

&gt;And in answer to your last post about unregulated capitalism as a problem, think about this. Capitalistic business relies on consumers of whatever it is they sell. If the consumers abandon them, another business springs up to take its place.

To a degree. Although at the same time, capitalism often excludes people from it. It also leads to ever increasing inequalities. I'd argue part of the reason America was great during your lifetime was interventionist policies and union participation. We found a pretty decent balance between capitalism and other priorities. But that balance has been upset, and now we're starting to go back to the way things were in the gilded age. "

That star isn't traveling at light speed, just the light particles it emits can travel at that speed. Also stars didn't just emerge fully formed from the big bang. 

You could think of the universe like a giant [constantly expanding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_universe) bubble. Everything in the universe is basically moving away from everything else, in all directions, as it expands. Somewhat similar to drawing some dots to represent galaxies on a deflated balloon and then blowing it up and seeing the distance between the dots grow. 

Nothing in space is stationary, the milky way, our sun are all moving through space. Similar to a galaxy that may be moving away from us in another direction. This is like two cars driving away from each other, as opposed to a car driving away from a stationary object. 

These articles will explain the expansion and formation of stars way better than I could.

If you're  into seeing *more* Lincoln related things, New Salem is 30 minute drive from the city.

As for your first comment, I don't know what you are remotely saying. If you read what I wrote, I said Davis will definitely walk. And what I said was exactly what you are saying. Strike up long term deals or trade. I believe, I said, that the team would be stupid to let him (Davis) walk and not trade him.

As for Tillman, he isn't a free agent until 2018. So we have 4 seasons left of him under team control. So...

So yeh, I don't know what you were trying to get at with your first comment, since half of it was wrong (wrong in the fact that yes, if Tillman continues his success he will inevitably walk ""when [he] can"" but this post was about the future, and I think remaining on a team for the next 4 seasons (Where Davis and Wieters only have 2 seasons left) is considered the future to me), and the other half agreed with what I said in the first place."

The MRM is its own worst enemy at times, but judging the (potential) value of the movement by focusing on the troglodytes in it is akin to dismissing feminism entirely because of bad encounters with SJW muppets on Tumblr. Feminism certainly didn't have a lot of academic clout or political legitimacy in its early days, and judging MR by a much harsher yardstick strikes me as being pretty unfair.

Also, as someone who's somewhat sympathetic to several common MR talking points, it annoys me greatly to see men's issues get blithely reframed as feminist ones.

Even my father doesn't have it that bad, but it is SO frustrating to try to hold a conversation with him. I just had to accept that talking with my dad is talking about whatever's got his attention at the time. I have it too and I know I do the same thing, but I do try not to and have managed to keep it under control at least sometimes. But it takes conscious effort that my dad doesn't put forth. Couples therapy/counseling might be able to show your SO that that effort is necessary to the relationship.

I think they made enough money on the previous gen with the game and are going to move onto something new for next gen. And don't forget it's not going to be too easy of a port: Rockstar will need to familiarize themselves with the new architecture while porting. And I imagine there were lots of little ""hacks"" in the code of GTAV to squeeze every ounce of performance possible out of the systems.

Afterlife:

* There would be an afterlife. This occurs miraculously. Consciousness would be physical and brain-based until the point of death, then you would move on to the afterlife. Your mind would lack the capacity to experience boredom or impatience, unless you wanted to. You also lack the desire to harm anything or anyone. You get to live forever and experience whatever you want. Any consciousness-inhibiting neurological malformations are healed. You can gain all knowledge of everything that has happened/will happen/could happen in this world. You do so gradually by experiencing it yourself. Essentially the purpose of this after life is to pursue knowledge and understanding of yourself and the world, and you get to do so for as long as you wish. Every answerable question you've ever had could be answered, and you could choose to experience any possibility you could imagine. You could even choose to be reincarnated, if you wanted.

What kind of father would punish his grandchildren, great grandchildren, and so on for thousands of years because of something their ancient ancestors did? This is a God of love? No matter how angry I might get with my children, I would never hurt my grandchildren to get even with my children. I certainly wouldn't hurt my great grandchildren. That's perverse.

julesandthebigun,Anxiety,1391047377.0,"When you say meds do you mean anxiety meds or all medicine?

When I get 'anxiety belly' as I call it, I find Pepto, Canada Dry or soda crackers (or some combination) to be very helpful. Even just the taste of it reminds me that everything is going to be okay, probably because I would take these things as a kid when I had an upset stomach and I always felt better. Maybe they actually do something or maybe it is just a placebo effect.

Aside from that, I like doing this little easy exercise called grounding. Where you 'ground' yourself in your surroundings and it helps you concentrate. What you do is find three things each of things you can: see, hear, touch, and smell/taste. (smell and taste don't often have three each, but that's okay). So for example I'll be feeling anxious on the bus and I look around and I see: trees out the window, some ducks (cuties!) and a lady walking her dog. I hear: people talking about work, the hum of the engine and the music I'm listening to. And so on. I find it relaxing. Hopefully that helps you a bit. :)"

It seemed selfish for me to own them, for Trevor to take them, for the money in my wallet to come from them. In a way, I felt like they were owed that much, though. The money was only a bonus. Maybe, if they were lucky, they would take their own dream.

Pointy130,leagueoflegends,1391047465.0,"&lt;rant&gt;

He can plant traps with comparable damage to Lux lasers (5% increased scaling at the cost of 50 base damage), that slow for 50% for 4 seconds, he's got an outdated mechanic as his Q that completely shuts down any auto-dependant champion for 2.5 seconds, he has an absolutely effortless damage over time passive, and he's one of the best kiting champions despite having extraordinarily low autoattack range for a ranged champion, leaving him perpetually *just barely out of range for all of your skills* so you try to land one and miss by a fraction of an inch. In addition, Liandries is so brokenly powerful on him, because it stacks with all of his damage over time components, and doubles on his shrooms.

Every Teemo I've ever had the misfortune to lane against ignored farm almost completely for the sole purpose of standing at the front of the minion wave and autoattacking me to deny me farm and EXP. They would literally rather starve themselves out and be useless for half the game, because they know that once I'm forced to leave and participate in teamfights, behind in EXP and gold, they can just AFK-push the lane and take towers, because they aren't expected to have teamfight presence anyway. If I'm jungling, it's damn-near impossible to catch the fucker, even in S3 and S2, just because without Oracles it's fucking hard to avoid mushrooms, and if you take the time to clear them, you leave yourself in vision and able to be caught out by the enemy team. If you somehow avoid walking into them, you still gave your position away, and he's just going to bounce back under tower, spamming laugh like a cocky son of a bitch.

Almost every Teemo I have on my team never once leaves the lane, and doesn't try to push tower, because ""I don't want to be forced to overextend"", even long after the lane phase has ended, and a valid time to splitpush has opened up.

I understand that there's a whole bandwagon thing. I don't give a fuck about the bandwagon. I hate Teemo because whenever I'm forced to play with him, I'd rather be driving nails through my hands.

Some subs are big circle jerks that I almost never agree with. I stay subbed because my brain can turn those into staying current for the lols. I don't bother commenting because I feel no desire to try.

Humans desire to be social means we kind of censor ourselves to some extent. Reddit is just a far larger community than most people are used to, especially the defaults. As a result, the ebb and flow skew us further than we are aware until something makes us aware. Meh."

namer98,Christianity,1391047627.0,"&gt; In your mind, legalism is a ""yes"" ""no"" toggle, where you have followed direction ""yes"" = salvation and ""no"" = damnation

Not at all. Legalism is a saying ""you must perform these exact actions"", which is counter to a religion that puts so much emphasis on faith alone. Except as you are telling me, it isn't faith alone.

&gt; Can't you see that you have presented a false dichotomy?

Then please present a third box based on scripture. You have not yet done so.

&gt;because you believe that to follow God's commands would mean that God MUST damn us for our inadequacies (such as death before baptism), because you believe that God has no grace, then you have made a grave mistake. 

Here you seem to indicate that baptism is not required.

I agree that this should be a safe area for those who are or who are involved within the queer lady culture. But I don't think it has to be an exclusive group like the way you are describing it. To me the idea of creating exclusive ""safe spaces"" just perpetuates the ""us and them"" mentality, which is counterproductive to the equality movement.

I'm not trying to dissuade you of your opinions just trying to illustrate the differences between ours. 

Also as for the grumpypants comment. In your original comment you called yourself a ""huge grump"" and had a ~harrrrrrrumph~ at the end of. Still if being labeled grumpypants is that asinine to you I'll just remove it.

Check that your computer is properly cooled, don't use other programs while playing DF, check your task manager for memory and cpu usage (If you get a ton of usage percentage, then you *are* lacking power, but if you get too little, there are ways to make programs get more than twice as much juice out of your system without overclocking or anything), if you have a cpu that supports multi threading, investigate about your model and check if it's working or if there's any way to imrpoove it."

I paid $17 for mine at CVS! But that was Whole Food's sale price, not their usual.

Don't go TOO out of your way :P  Cuz I can walk to Whole Foods, but if you're driving I imagine the savings may be eaten up by gas expenditure.  

If you are willing to splurge a little, I treat myself sometimes to their organic fresh squeezed orange juice jugs.  It's $6...but tastes amazing.

In that situation, the smart play for the dominant team is to take dragon, and then if the other team still can't effectively contest an objective, take another objective. By ceding dragon, they gave the other team gold that they could have denied them, and the gold differential between giving them dragon to take baron, and taking dragon and giving them nothing slants towards taking dragon being the smart move."

EyebrowsOnSpoons,WritingPrompts,1391048256.0,"They say it isn't wise, to associate with them. They're to be contained. Locked away. Even though it wasn't their fault that they were radioactive. That everyone and everything their fingertips and lips touched exploded, impacted by extreme heat. It wasn't their fault, the forest fires reaching tendrils across the trees, leaving them scarred with black.

They lived peacefully, under gloved hands, until Devon and Drina got greedy. Two teenagers. One was radioactive, the other normal. It didn't matter which one was which because they had learned not to care. But Devon's burn marks were on his sink and his leather-concealed hands were a reminder that when he smiled, he could set aflame. 

Yet that did nothing to stop the ache. It was in their bones - the timid pair was greedy, handsy, and explosive.

It started when he touched her that night. They were both a little fizzy from the drinks consumed, but not so much that they were incoherent. She was pressed against a brick wall, Devon's breath hot on her pink cheeks.

He removed a glove. He stammered out softly, ""I want to.""

She nodded. She couldn't quiet the hunger anymore, and she needed something to fill the hollow of his touch. He skimmed her cheek, watching as it blossomed into red burns. But yet he continued. They were invincible as all teenagers believe they are. Or maybe it was that they were truly in love, and this love was too hot for them to handle.

It all broke loose. He gripped her waist, and she wrapped her legs around him. He crashed his lips against hers, undressing her when she was pushed against the wall enough not to require his hands to support her. 

She was fervent, stripping his shirt off and reciprocating his movements. In the midst of that, they took at moment to  pull back - seeing each other - before it happened. 

He consumed her. One bright flash of flame, and they both were atomic. Charged and released, signaling to the entire world that the Reactants were unnatural.

Capable of destruction never seen before. "

manisier,Christianity,1391048303.0,"They preach something that sounds awfully close to prosperity gospel (God rewards believers physically, and you receive more when you give more), the same gospel that is espoused by teachers like Joel Osteen and Steven Furtick. Hillsong itself tries to avoid making clear statements on what they are actually preaching due to the massive amount of criticism they receive both in media and in Christian circles, but at their annual conference, their guest speakers are all well-known preachers of the prosperity gospel.

The reason why this kind of teaching is toxic is because it teaches that God is a means to an end. If you believe in God and give to the church, He will bless you in return. In reality, it's the other way around. There are plenty of believers who continue to endure trials, and there are plenty of non-believers who are doing very well for themselves in financial terms. This is a kind of false teaching that is warned about it 

""...and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. But godliness with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world."" 1 Timothy 6:5-7 ESV

As a side note, I really like most of Hillsong's music. I tend to shy away from the songs that are really me-focused, since I can't bring myself to sing words that elevate myself and my efforts above God, but there are some really great worship songs like Cornerstone that are Christ-centered. My church does not play Hillsong during worship though, because we don't want to pay royalties towards a church whom we deem to be supporting false teachers (if not engaging in false teaching itself). 

If you still have questions, watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLRue4nwJaA) by John Piper before you move on. It describes the prosperity gospel better than I could."

Firmicutes,gaybros,1391048565.0,"If anything, I don't think the opera will be much similar to the film. For one, the libretto for this work was actually written by the original author of the short story whereas the screenplay was written by different people. The composer is into postmodernism and serialism (I haven't heard much of him but his music reminds me of Schoenberg or of Stravinsky), so I doubt the music will be ""pretty"" music evocative of the beautiful landscape like the music from the film, but rather it will reflect on the harsh environment and on the two's relationship as viewed by themselves, and by society.

Anyway back to your point I think just about any story, no matter how [ridiculous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falstaff_(opera) or [serious](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenufa), can be opera material; it just depends on how well the composer and the librettist work together. They once made an opera about Anna Nicole Smith and that got decent reviews. Opera is one of the finest art forms to ever exist. Composers have always looked to ancient legends, books, and plays for ideas, why not movies?

artthoumadbrother,PurplePillDebate,1391048590.0,"I don't think those are the only two options. Women are physically inferior and the value of non-physical talents have only recently become widely acknowledged by the majority of society. Remember that while history remembers and touts as heroes plenty of politicians, scientists, and philosophers, those were always from the very wealthy classes who made up less than 1% of the population. There wasn't even a 'middle class' really until fairly recently. At any given time prior to 1900, 99% of everyone on Earth was involved in some form of manual labor for their primary livelihood and men are demonstrably better at manual labor. Women were viewed as a burden because they couldn't produce as much but still required resources from the men in order to stay alive. When you add in the fact that being physically stronger also allowed men to do whatever they pleased to women, it only strengthened the idea that women were weak and to be treated as chattel. 

When you throw in the fact that enlightened ideas like 'every life has value' and 'people should free to pursue their own happiness and not enslaved to service others' weren't popular or even generally known up until a couple hundred years ago, it really isn't surprising.

What is surprising is that people who should know better cling to the same ideas today, and for less reason. Really, calling upon the wisdom of the ancients as your appeal to authority is pretty hilariously misguided, OP. They didn't know *anything* about anything. The average person had no understanding of philosophy, no understanding that other people had lives just as full of emotion and struggle as their own, and no idea how the world around them worked---and no time to think about those things as they had to spend all of their waking hours working their asses off to stay alive. They were also miserable and died from all sorts of ridiculous things. Life was bleak. Uneducated, angry, miserable people will treat each other like shit.

JorddyK,Aquariums,1391048689.0,"For me, I'd extend that to pets in general. After a friendship with an animal, no matter how long, I get downright attached. I'm a guy, and I cry shamelessly when my friend's dogs and cats pass away.

*Somewhat Relevant Story Time!*

I once went with my best friend to put down his cat, she was suffering from untreatable stomach issues that caused her to vomit up to twenty times every day.

 She was only like this for several days, as my friend and his family decided to put her to sleep so she wouldn't have to suffer. They invited me to come with them because they needed support and I was the closest family friend. I was hesitant at first, but took up the offer because I believed my friend would do the same for me. 

I insisted on driving them to and from the vet. I had read online that it is helpful for families to spend their last minutes close to the animal being put to sleep; the time immediately after was supposed to be spent with eachother.

The cat gets put down, we get back into the car, everybody just stops holding back their tears at once. This was including myself. It was truly a bonding moment, as was the ride back home. We spent this time recounting fond memories of her many attempts at escape, her tendency to scratch them when she's just trying to snuggle, and how she would come downstairs at exactly 7:30 and watch jeopardy with them. 

I'll never forget that, it was my only experience to date that involved that caliber of emotion with people who aren't immediate family members. It redefined family for me to include our furry, wet, and scaly friends."

But I believe this to be a cultural/mentality thing, education, religion, tradition, rolemodels etc. are usually very similar in certain cultures, mine included, and shape individuals to a certain extent. 

Now, I don't feel like I should defend myself, because my opinion is not what I would deem morally right, and as such shouldn't be defended...just hear me out.

When I was younger, I never even thought I could even be a racist, my dad was a foreigner, how stupid would that be? 

I always knew it was morally wrong, but after moving to a different country (Scandinavia, whiter than white) and a bigger city, and having been randomly groped in the streets by really only dark skinned immigrants, I can't help it. 

Those thoughts came and they won't go. And I know it's not everybody with a certain ethnicity, I know it's not in the genes, but in one individuals upbringing, pretty much the same as with all the white shitheads I met in my life. But the groping, the invading of personal space, the disregard for me as a person makes me absolutely furious. All the ""Hey baby""'s and being grabbed or pulled by the wrist is fucking horrifying, no matter who does it.

And boom, after making it through over 20 years without being a racist, I have become a motherfucking racist. And I hate it so much.

I really would like to be able to start a sentence not with 

""I'm not racist, but...""

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391048731.0,"I cannot say I am in agreement to you, because your analogy only includes two people, and while explained well, the scenario is oversimplified (keep in mind this isn't due to a lack of explanation, but due to the scenario simply not reflecting reality). Yes, in that sitation, with two people, there is no reason to be violent, but reality? Eh. Often times it has been deemed by some that it is worth committing murder against other individuals, that being said, people often band together to protect themselves, and may often use violence other groups in self defense. Or maybe they simply want their crap. Sometimes, in some situations, the only way people can survive is to take from others via violence. 

Sometimes, people need to be coerced to be part of a defense against another tribe, because if they don't, the tribe will kill them. Sometimes they are the aggressors, which I generally deem to be wrong, but say that it's for survival?

Say we live in a country of 300 million people, which sometimes has to commit violence to ensure its own survival? 

And as far as voluntary interactions go, let's look at society, not your two person simple interaction, but society. Say everyone owns the land. Say a small group own most of the wealth. Say that in order for others to acquire the means for their survival, that they must work for those who own all of the wealth? Say that workers use these concepts of property rights to legitimize their ownership of stuff? What if we're actually still slaves, mentally? You often allude to this with the state, but what about capitalism? What if I have no choice for survival, peacefully, but to ""agree"" to some guy's rules, even if it basically forces me into a position similar to the enslavement you mentioned? 

I'm just saying, your views are overly simplistic. And it's not because of a lack of explanation, don't think it's not overly simplistic because it isn't explained thoroughly, I understand what you're trying to get at. it's just that reality is more complex than that.

Look, anarcho capitalism is a fine social system to be used in a game of minecraft, where people can just go out, build a house on a piece of land, and call it theirs. A scenario where there is always enough for everyone, because the land is ALWAYS expanding, and if you're unsatisfied with current conditions, you can always move, and make it yourself. But reality doesn't work that way. Say there's a 3 year old minecraft server limited to a 500x500 plot of land. Imagine the land is diddied up by the first people on the server, and if you wish to survive and thrive, your only option is to work in their mines. But honestly, for every 64 stack of coal you mine, you're entitled to one piece. For every 64 stack of wood you make, you're guaranteed to one piece. And the kicker, is, this is perfectly okay, because the exchange is voluntary, m i rite? Well, what would you do in such a situation? You'd probably say screw this and log off and play on a better server.

But imagine this as life. Imagine that the only way for you to acquire wealth is to work in another person's store, or factory, and for all of this wealth you produce, you're only guaranteed a pittance. Sure, you can go to the next establishment over, but they also offer a pittance, because there's no incentive to give you any more. They own the property, you're entitled only to what they're willing to give you. Say you can't log off of that minecraft server. Say you're forced to play, because the only option other than paying is to die. 

This is my criticism of capitalism. Look, you propose a valid analogy, and your conclusions are valid, FOR THAT ANALOGY, but honestly, reality is just a lot more complex of a place, because there are more people, and a more advanced level of development, the fact that all of the land is taken. "

ANewMachine615,conspiracy,1391048987.0,"&gt;Any executive orders must, constitutionally, be constricted to outlining the prerogatives of the agencies within the Executive branch or taking care that already-existing laws are faithfully executed

Except that this has not been the historical understanding of the ""executive power."" The controlling theory of executive power has been the [unitary executive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory) for basically the entire history of the US, from the Federalist Papers on forward. Though the content has waxed and waned, the fact is that executive orders are not necessarily unconstitutional. What you've outlined are executive *duties* under the Constitution, but powers are a far different thing.

&gt;Given that the power of legislation is explicitly given to the legislature, any executive order that serves as a legislative stand-in is unconstitutional

And what, exactly, is your definition of legislation? For instance, he can't impose penalties or the like. In the video, he's specifically talking about his prior actions he's taken to reduce gun violence. What exactly has he done? Well, [this is an overview](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/03/obama-announces-gun-control-actions/). New requirements for federal authorities fall under the prerogatives of agencies, even in your model. The other things -- some incentives to hire security officers and funding research into gun violence -- are done with Congressionally-approved budgets. Making it easier for states to report mental health information is, again, just setting the rules for how executive agencies will handle that information. The specific changes here are just departmental interpretations of governing statutes -- a necessary part of any administration of that statute, surely. 

I'm really not sure why executive orders, which fall under the administration and execution of the laws, are problematic for you. I'd expect far more robust exercises to be an issue (for instance, executive agreements with other countries), but this stuff seems pretty bare-bones necessary executive prerogatives."

reginaidiotarum,TiADiscussion,1391049028.0,"Culture is an overarching mentality. Popular art, popular music, popular design, and popular thought are all elements of a culture. I do not see one of these elements supporting rape. The closest I've heard of recently, where someone suggested rape as a thing was when Daniel Tosh made an off-hand comment to a heckler. That was not well received at all.

America has a violence culture, we see guns as a solution in more movies and television shows than I can count. We have a drug culture, where drugs are seen as both the problem and the solution. We also have a sexualized culture, as it isn't hard to find pieces that revolve around sex as temptation, sex as accomplishment, or sex as major conflict. I'm going to note here that the sex in the plot device is always consensual. What I do not see is a culture that's obsessed with painting rape as a positive thing.

The very few times I've seen rape in culture is either in painting those that do or threaten to do rape as very bad people. Apart from physically harming something innocent, this is the easiest way to paint someone as a very bad person. I don't think anyone is saying that rape is a thing from a cultural standpoint.*

There is the misguided attempts at saying that we have a purported rape culture based on victim blaming. I hear of cases like this, but when explained it doesn't make sense. ""Well, that lawyer said she was asking for it by her dress."" Yes, of course, he's the Defense, his job is to find any doubt or loophole involved with the prosecution's case, and call it into question. He is supposed to call into question everything the witness thinks happens to make sure the case is fair. A trail without a Defense is like the trial from Alice in Wonderland, where she's proclaimed guilty before evidence is even provided.

The other argument is the self defense one. ""Why do girls need to be taught to defend themselves when boys can be taught not to rape."" Apart from how bad the logic in this statement is, ie that boys already get taught not to rape ((Every year since they did sex ed, there has been a health class lecture as to what is and isn't rape)), but they also get taught to not physically harm others, steal from others, do drugs, and a boat load of other things. The problem is that the difference between ""Don't do drugs"" and ""Do drugs"" is one really ignorable word. I think the pepper spray, the self-defense courses, the ""safety tips"" are less about preventing rape and more about empowering women to feel they have more of a say as to what happens. To deny education in this regard, you work to remove options, or agency, from potential victims, and further empower those that wish to do harm.

We as a society disdain rape, but, like murder and theft, it's something that we cannot prevent from happening all the time, we can only heighten our personal security. It's a crap-shoot that women feel more vulnerable, and it's a terrible thing that women are not always capable of preventing it, but I wouldn't blame the world for the actions of an individual operating against its wishes.

*I just rewatched Firefly with a friend and got to ""Objects in Space."" They make the threat of rape a real and scary thing to make the bad guy of that episode utterly despicable. They do a good job at showing Kaylee's vulnerability to the thought of it, and how traumatizing it is for that to even be an option on the table. The threat is enough to convince her crew-mate, held gun point, to stop resisting."

I always felt like our friendship was very strong; it's just there was no romantic attraction from her end. Not only did I help her through her hard times, she helped me numerous times too over the past four years. She helped me find the career I love at this moment. She helped me find a house. When I helped her finding jobs and talking to adults, she helped me back. I don't think I was just a listener; there was something more dynamic. 

Regarding to your last paragraph, that makes my heart flutter, but I am going to not acknowledge the possibility atm because getting stuck in that mindset is asking for a world of hurt. But how do I check that her feelings may have changed? Will she have to make a move? "

speedisavirus,politics,1391049261.0,"I can sympathize but there is a point where people are responsible for their choices. I went to college without any help and graduated with close to $40,000 in loans. The difference is I evaluated the job market, my interests, and my strengths to pick something that would allow me to repay that debt. I didn't take art history or early American literature because those wouldn't likely repay that burden. If one studies something without a future they earned the burden of that debt. You don't get a reset button on life and others shouldn't have to lose out for another's poor choices.

In my opinion there are 2 things. The system fails students by not being realistic about what a student with a given degree can expect out of it. They should be required to inform incoming students of things like median salary and counsel on the current job market for a given degree. That way they can make an informed poor decision. They won't though because there is a chance they may just not attend and lose the school money. 

The second thing, there are options for people to get out from under that debt. There are programs where people can teach for X years and then the debt is eventually forgiven for their service. They could join the military which offers money for this upon enlistment as well. Or, like anyone else in crushing debt they can work more than one job even if its a shitty job.

If you are sexually attracted to children, it is pretty logical to presume that you will attempt to gain sexual gratification with children, either directly by having sexual contact with them, or indirectly by consuming child pornography.

Through either form of sexual gratification you are contributing to the sexual abuse of a child.   Either by abusing them directly or by contributing to others abusing children to create the child pornography.

I think Holocaust denial should be illegal, but in a place where it isn't, any self-respecting company should want to distance themselves from deniers as much as possible.

It's not even about ""Freedom of Speech"", that is just an excuse when people use their own ""free speech"" to ridicule, criticize, and laugh at these jerks. Hence all the whining when they get downvoted and they start throwing a fit about being ""censored"".

They only believe in the freedom to spew their nonsense without being contradicted. They are petulant children who think there should be absolutely no repercussions for their childish behavior."
designernailaccents,weddingplanning,1391049550.0,"Do you need to make an appointment?  -This varies from store to store. A big commercial chain like David's Bridal would need an appointment booked. Smaller, locally owned salons can be different. I set up an appointment at one but when I walked in I pretty much had full reign of the shop since no one else was there. At another bridal salon I asked if I needed an appointment and they said to just come in whenever. When in doubt I'd just call to see what they require. Better safe than sorry.

Style? -Just ask to try on a few different styles to see what you like/what fits best. I went with something a little different than what I though would work for me but I wouldn't have known if I hadn't tried it on. Seriously, if it's your first time then just take your time to try on a few different things. Don't even worry about feeling rushed. If you focus on feeling rushed you'll cause unnesccessary stress.

Overwhelming feeling? -Some people get this, others don't. I didn't cry or freak out. I just kept comparing every dress to the one I liked most and after about 6-7 dresses after ""the one"" I just felt like there was nothing else I was going to find that would make me want ""the one"" less. So it is completely normal to not have that feeling. I wasn't expecting it either but I found what I liked and I left a happy girl!"

VictorianMeltdown,NoStupidQuestions,1391049577.0,"The biggest difference between fake and real suede is that real suede can be permanently stained by just a few drops of water, while fake suede is water repellant. Also, suede cracks as it ages, while fake suede tends to look the same the older it gets. So, spotting fake suede isn't easy unless you're willing to stain a bit of the real stuff. Also, the vast majority of real suede products say so on the label. If it doesn't say that it's suede on the label, then it probably isn't. 

Leather is a bit easer. There are a few ways to tell the difference between real and fake. The most noticeable difference is the smell-no faux leather will smell like real leather. Fake leather will also feel more plastic-y than the real thing (I have a fake leather jacket, it looks pretty real but texture wise, it feels just like plastic. My mom jokingly calls it my ""pleather"" jacket). Also, look closely at the leather. Fake leather tends to have consistent pores, while real leather's pores tend to be more spread out. As with suede, if it is real leather, the label will say so. If the label does not say that it's leather, it probably isn't. "

Description of Gulenists as 'cheerful' was also amusing -- the guy is famous for his tears.

You're probably right about the misplaced optimism, but it's hard to tell what direction they'll go with the presidential election after the local elections. I initially thought he might win the presidential elections if he went for it, but I can't be so sure anymore. It depends on the opposition candidate too. I actually can't think of a good one, but Erdoğan may not want to risk it anymore to begin with. AKP will probably still get enough votes to not need a coalition in general elections with or without Erdoğan, but again, a lot depends on the other two elections."

I find that eating a low GI diet means I am less hungry. Protein at every meal and eat it first. More vegetables. Low GI carbs. More fiber. More water. Good fats. I find almonds and peanut butter make good snacks. Caffeine makes me more hungry. Less sugar. If you crave sweets try eating fruits. Amazing how fruit can cure a sugar craving. Not right away but over a period of time. You're going to have to retrain your palate and you may need to do that before you start cutting back on calories.

deschutron,depression,1391049811.0,"I remember that there's a class of problems called NP-complete where the set if options is so big that you can't solve them without guessing wrong options and checking them. In real life we face problems like this but often we can't check the options without choosing them, so then we have to risk making mistakes. I think the frequency of this makes it impossible for people to succeed without making mistakes.

Also, feeling bad decreases your mental resources, which increases your chance to make mistakes.

Confidence increases your mental resources, but deciding to believe in yourself doesn't work, because without confirming evidence, your brain stops believing you.

Beliefs come from evidence and logic. Confidence comes from validation, which you can get by solving problems or doing creative things.

Playing games is a good way to recover the feeling that you can do things. When I do that, I try to invest that confidence in doing something a bit harder and then collect the confidence from doing that and see how high I can take it."

equiraptor,Cumberbitches,1391049844.0,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""regular leather boots"". The ease of bending and moving varies with the leather type used, the seams and billows, etc. In boots that aren't designed for motorcycle use, bending an ankle is easy enough. But that leather will shred easily in a crash and offers little protection. The boots also won't offer a lot of protection from twisting your ankle. Boots that are designed for use on bikes like cruisers will have thicker leather that'll offer good abrasion protection and will help the ankle not twist in a crash, but won't be as flexible. Boots designed for use on sport bikes will have the thicker leather the ankle protection like the cruiser boots, and will have bellows on the front of the ankle that act as joints in the leather, letting the ankle bend well enough to work the controls, while still offering good abrasion resistance and resistance against unhealthy twisting.

I don't know what kind of boots you're talking about, nor about what your definition of ""bend easily"" is. There's a lot of grey area in there. But boots designed for motorcycle use have a few different features that you won't find in boots designed for fashion, hiking, work boots, etc. Of course, each will offer things the motorcycle boots don't, as well."

mmp31,politics,1391049967.0,"&gt;i'm sorry but you are completely cherry-picking a statistic right there. out of all of the factors that go into wages, you pointed out that a random job and the min wage increasing at roughly (but not the same) rate.

Using an exmaple to illustrate your point is not cherry-picking.  And the reason they didn't increase by exactly the same percentage is because of those other factors that have affected wages.

&gt;you didn't even compare the mean and median of the jobs (easily could be materially different).

Could be, but unlikely in that scenario.

&gt;you, in no way, proved that salaries are tied to the min wage, which they are not. 

I never claimed that salaries are ""tied"" to the minimum wage. I claimed that increasing the minimum wage puts upward pressure on wages, and that, given all things equal (as in, if there were no other external forces affecting wages), it will cause a proportional increase in all other wages, given enough time.

&gt;since then, we haven't had inflation above 5%. not interested in making a rule around a statistical anomaly. 

And if it happens again, I guess those poor people will need to just suck it up and take one for the team due to another ""statistical anomaly"".  Besides, it doesn't matter if it's 14% or 5% per year because it's the principle of the situation.

&gt;no thank you. inflation is just fine in moderation. 

At what line do you have to cross before inflation goes from being ""just fine"" to being bad?

&gt;this is especially true concerning wages. workers and unions don't like pay cuts. they are bad for the economy and result in unhappy workers with less money in their pockets. companies will always have good and bad years, regardless of inflation. if a company has a good year (better than inflation), then that's great. they can easily give pay raises to employees to cover the inflation. however, if a company has a bad year, good luck trying to negotiate lower wage prices. these companies will probably just have to fire people instead. but, the increase in inflation is what saves companies from having to lower wages.

But inflation cuts the payrates of workers who don't get a raise to keep up with inflation anyway.  During bad years for that company, you're not really advocating for higher wages, you're just advocating for disguising the fact that workers are taking a pay cut by doing it through inflation instead of through a direct pay cut.

&gt;additionally, a target of 0 inflation could easily lead to deflation, which is good for nobody. when prices go down, so will wages and production and it starts a vicious cycle.

Deflation is no more harmful than inflation.  Higher prices lead to decreased production which also causes a vicious cycle like what we saw in the 1970s.

&gt;also, when targeting 0 inflation, a period of inflation will be followed by a period of deflation and vice versa. this causes price levels to be constantly changing, which leads to a more volatile market. when inflation is around 2-3%, a down year for the economy won't affect price levels much, if at all, while an up year will just cause a slight increase in price levels. 

Price levels are constantly changing under 2-3% inflation as well. That's no more volatile than 0% moving average inflation rate.

&gt;less volatility in the economy and corps can more easily plan for the future.

Rigging the economy to benefit corporations at the expense of the poor is not a good idea.

&gt;lastly, inflation causes an incentive for investment/saving. if inflation is 0, people will have money under their mattresses rather than somewhere in the economy. again, not good for anybody.

Absolutely false.  Zero percent inflation doesn't encourage investment any more than it encourages savings.  It allows consumers to receive more accurate signals from the market because they are not being distorted by the false signals of inflation telling them to invest when they other wise wouldn't have.  Not to mention that inflation destroys savings.

&gt;i think the idea of a progressive negative income tax system should be discussed. automation is on the horizon and outsourcing is always an option. i like the fact that its progressive, but everybody is going to have to get at least something, which makes it expensive (trillions of dollars) even with welfare cuts. 

No, not everybody...just the people who qualify for it."

give the mock protesters tennis balls, they are ""bricks"" you get hit with one above the neck you drop to the ground and have to be treated

the Molotov cocktails was a nice touch but each of these new issues were treated separately, in a riot and someone is going to throw one at an officer they probably will have little disregard if a fellow rioter may also get injured.

It was great watching something that I found entertaining every day, I didn't get bored of the characters since the writing was, at that time, very good.

New episodes were out every day, but there were breaks over christmas.  
There was no real advantage other than not having to wait a week to find out what happens, however the downside is that quality is often compromised. If not, eventually a talented pool of writers will leave the show.

One advantage of soaps is they can be very flexible and act as a springboard for various plots. There's no reason why something like Breaking Bad couldn't happen on a soap but clearly it wouldn't have the same production values because of the turn-around time."

That's no way to live. People like Snoop can get away with it because they have safety nets of their previous success and have talent. Most people here can't.

I want to speak out against this attitude of ""smoke weed erryday"" because it upsets me. It gives a bad image in the time we're in, when we're trying to get it legalized.

Depends on how you define ""war."" Active combat operations are going to end at the end of 2014. The 10,000 would be primarily training of Afghan forces, with some spec ops teams to hit al Qaeda. But we'd be giving up the fight against the Taliban.

&gt;Obama is not building a cleaner planet. He is over-riding existing environmental protections in America and elsewhere by negotiating the TPP treaty which over-rides National Laws.

Can you cite this? My understanding was that the TPP was to be an executive agreement, which means it cannot change federal law in any way.

The most important point that people seem to overlook is, if that's how EQ was, and it was truly better that way, then *that* would be the model everyone would copy, and make millions of dollars and be wildly more successful than all these other games that do things differently.

I've never quite followed the logic of the argument that the next MMO will be more popular if their way of doing things differently is to go back to doing things the way we used to.  First of all, that's not actually being new and different, that's being old and not at all different, or different only in sense that it's different from the other games introduced these last few years, but not different from their predecessors.  Secondly, MMOs are remarkably more popular today than they were back then -- this seems to fly in the face of the notion that they were much better back then than they are now, and that all these newer innovations have been making them worse rather than better.

If making an ""old school"" MMO was the secret to success, it wouldn't be a secret, and ""old school"" MMOs would never have been eclipsed in the first place.

I'm all for new and different in an MMO.  I'm getting tired of people suggesting that the best way to be ""new and different"" is to go back to doing things the old way.  Repeating the past is not ""new and different"", even when it's the more distant past instead of the immediate past."

flashmedallion,AskReddit,1391050225.0,"&gt;death might change that.

Death doesn't change the laws of thermodynamics; nothing does, as you mentioned earlier.

If you're suggesting that there is some other, undetectable form of energy that our brain energy ""ejects"" to then sure, it's not something that can really be ruled out right now but if it's something undetectable to humans then it's not a particularly fruitful avenue of scientific enquiry.  At least for now.

&gt;If it transfers, it will retain a similar-but-less-than form.

I don't think this is a reasonable assumption.  The information about, say, the gravitation potential energy of an object is not comparable to the information about it's kinetic energy (plus its electromagnetic and thermal energy caused by air resistance, and the kinetic energy of the sound it produces) when in free-fall.  The same hold when the object converts energy in coming to rest.  I don't think it can be stated with any confidence that any future or past energy state of something will be ""similar"", by any stretch of the definition.

In addition, I'd have to wonder why it is that this other form of energy is only available to energy that has been used by our brains.  I'm sure you are familiar with the laws of entropy, and heat is one of the higher entropic (grater amount of disorder) forms of energy in the universe.  It makes sense for energy to tend towards this, but I can't see a case to be made for energy to be funneled (ejected) towards a very specific form of energy through the pathway of our brains - it seems like a *concentration* or organisation of information which is of course a *decrease in entropy*.  Again: possible, but there are a lot of inconsistencies here at first glance.

You seem like an interesting thinker so I'm going to link you to [this](http://www.nightshadebooks.com/Downloads/Exhalation%20-%20Ted%20Chiang.html) short story by Ted Chiang, who I feel is one of the greatest sci-fi- writers of our times.  He deals very well in communicating complicated, fundamental ideas about science in a compelling narrative - I'm linking this one in particular because once you understand the key metaphor in the story you get a very eye-opening portrait of human consciousness and how it relates to certain universal scientific truths - and it's particularly relevant to this conversation.

VictorianMeltdown,NoStupidQuestions,1391050240.0,"Salt is actually pretty important. 

I'm a nursing student and actually have a test on this next Tuesday, so here's to hoping I remember it all. Here are a few functions of salt:

* Our neurons need it to ""talk"" to each other. Salt is vital for transmitting the electrical impulses neurons use to signal each other. 

* Salt helps regulate blood pH. Our blood would be too acidic without sodium bicarbonate to buffer it. 

* Our small intestines use it to help absorb certain nutrients. 

Our bodies cannot make salt, so we have to get it from our diets. Too much salt, however, will result in water retention to ""buffer"" it-that's why your hands can swell up if you eat a lot of salt (you can prevent this by drinking a lot of water so the excess salt is eliminated in the urine). In the long term, eating too much salt can cause high blood pressure, dehydration, and other issues. "

Kokana,fatpeoplestories,1391050521.0,"Feeling ranty. 

I just want to say that it gets tiring hearing childless people always attacking the parents first. 

You have no idea what his parent s are dealing with. You have no idea what they are trying to do to better this child's eating habits and exorcise. You have no idea if this kid actually has medical problems that are causing weight gain. 

Because absolutely everything wrong with a child under 18 years of age is completely the parents fault 100% of the time and they are evil horrible people who sit there stuffing their kids face with cheeseburgers all day long. 

Bullshit. 

To be as large as he is there has to be many factors as to why it's gotten this bad. A lot of it is probably psychological. He may suffer from a eating disorder. Just like a child who becomes addicted to drugs or alcohol. He needs help that maybe his parents can't afford or are trying now. if cps has been called I'm sure that was apart of their recommendations. 

Just because a kid has a problem doesn't mean his parents aren't doing their best to try and fix it. 

What do you want them to do? Buy a whip and chase his big ass around the block a couple times a day while padlocking the fridge and keeping a constant eye on him 24/7? Hell no! Because then then all of you would be spouting ""CHILD ABUSE! Call cps!""

It's not always as easy as ""His parents aren't doing their jobs call cps."" You don't know, so stop being so judgmental. These kind of comments are exactly the reason being a parent is so scary.

Geohump,askscience,1391050584.0,"That's water's secret, it's always boiling.

Always boiling in the sense that, any liquid water will always have some water molecules leaving the surface of water into the air, (evaporation), and some water molecules leaving the air into the water. so really, what I mean is water is always evaporating.

Boiling water isn't really the same as evaporation at all. With boiling water you have water that has been heated to a point where it will no longer stay lit with and has changed into a gas.

If you could look into the bottom of the pot while the water boils, you would see that as the water begins to boil, some of the bubbles of gas that form of the bottom of the pot, actually disappear as they leave the bottom of the pot begin to float upwards. Those are bubbles of gaseous water, then every condensed back into liquid water.

But just to be clear, water is always evaporating. Even when it's ice, there are some molecules leaving the surface of the ice and going into the air. When this happens we call it sublimation instead of evaporation.

Imagine if you will, a gymnasium full of kids playing dodgeball. Now mostly the kids don't cross the line in the middle because it's too dangerous. But there are always a few thrill seekers who are running across the line either to throw a ball, or to try to tempt the other side to throwing one at them.

This resembles the behavior of water molecules in a way, in that a few molecules are always slipping out of the liquid into the air, and a few of the water molecules in the error always slipping back into the liquid."

Maybe ask your Dad one day if he will sit down and have a civil conversation as to why you lost your faith. Use this as a way to understand your Dads beliefs better and find out what personally convinces your Dad that there actually is a God and why he thinks the bible is absolutely true. Has he ever had doubts about God? Just listen to his answer and don't look to challenge it or dis-prove him because it won't help as his reason probably won't be anything more than a ""feeling"" hes has in his heart. Remember he's a victim of religion just as you were once.

You went through a period of doubt just like your friend and when you finally decided to look for answers with an open mind, you looked everywhere and figured these things out for yourself. How can you possibly claim your religion is the right one without knowing the other possibilities. There are Muslims who believe in their religion just as fervently as your parents, so how can they know that they aren't the ones being tricked by the devil if they can't bother to see the other side of things. 

Even Jesus lovingly hung out with sinners non-believers, and its your dads God who will allow him to watch his daughter burn in hell for all eternity while he sits in heaven.

I know all of this is easier said than done. Just keep your cool with him no matter what and I hope one day he can see that you are still his daughter who loves him despite everything. "

My theory is that the brain responds to this, interpreting the closure-less song as an incomplete one (or, by all effects, the one you didn't hear complete). The brain tries to finish it using the previous information, but can't find what's needed until we either hear the end of the song or hear one that ends with the same chord the original should've.

This is not a ""huge"" sample size. In the '94 study, the sample size was 24 exposed and 20 not exposed. Again, that's unlikely to be significant for the entire population.

gooblyshmoo,utdallas,1391050906.0,"&gt; What is student life like?

student life is what you make of it, I think. UTD differs from a traditional college in that its a much smaller campus with a smaller student body, which means that its actually pretty likely for you to make a friend in class and see them more than once in the day without going out of your way to do so. student organizations are vast and plentiful, and cater to almost every interest. student organizations often host movie nights and concerts (childish gambino was here a year or two ago) and otherwise. however, school spirit is a little lacking since we don't have a football team or anything like that and our mascot is kind of embarrassing.



&gt; Do most people commute to the school or live on campus?

UTD was an exclusively commuter school until a few years ago, when they constructed (and are still constructing) a number of student dorms. most freshmen live on campus, many upperclassmen tend to commute from nearby apartment complexes or university village, the school's apartments. Dorms are a little expensive, but are fairly nice. you share a suite-style room and single bathroom with 2 other roommates and have access to study lounges, sitting areas, etc etc.



&gt; Do most students go home on the weekends?

It depends. not really sure about this one, sorry :(



&gt; How much adjusting did it take you coming from taking high school classes to succeed in college courses? 

I came from a very academically competitive high school and took a number of AP courses in my time there. I actually felt that my rigorous schedule in high school over-prepared me for college, and it didn't take me very long to adjust. the issue is just not falling behind on classwork and assignments, since you no longer have teachers breathing down your neck about turning anything in on time.

Unfortunately, in practice it tends to resemble Healthy At My Size, with the activist using their supposed practice of HAES to torpedo the most common basis for criticism of obesity: health. They focus on their performance on very narrow metrics (blood pressure, lipid values, ""feeling fabulous"") as proof that they're perfectly healthy and will encounter no health issues related to or caused by their weight in the long term. 

Regardless of how how you squint, tilt your head, and massage the data, scientific consensus is very clear that obesity is associated with a laundry list of co-morbidities, reduced quality of life and increased all-causes mortality. Flegal's bucked the trend, but that's one meta-analysis among many and it still showed that obesity in excess of Grade 1 (BMI 30-35) correlated strongly with increased mortality. The fativists I've seen on Tumblr, xojane and the like are largely well beyond that, but they persist in perpetuating the mass delusion that their body fat carries no risks.

Thin-shaming and fit-shaming (especially of other women) is also endemic in these communities; you don't have to look very far to dig up a poster comparing thin women to bones or wishing for a return to the halcyon days of yore where they'd be compared to little boys and ironing boards while the real curvy woman master race would fuck all the conventionally attractive men with athletic physiques.

You'll want something else to carry it in for drop/outter-shell scratch protection*, but it is so small addition to width that any kind of non-snap case will fit fine! 

Ohh, it won't scratch your real ds shell because it is lined with something! I just took off the top case to check and there was some fuzz from the cloth, but no scratchs! My ds has been in my coat pocket, or inside my bag everyday so that's a good sign!

I don't know if you can fit a circle pad pro over it, but it is so skinny I wouldn't be surprised if you could manage to get the circle pad over it! 

I did need to bend one of the top sides corner slightly when I put it on because it got bent during shipping. Also the purple was a slightly darker tint than in the photo, but it feels really nice to touch! 

*I use the white plastic/styrofoam bag that covered the ds when you open the box after buying. I am planning to get one those leather cases that was posted on here that are like 50 or 60 dollars eventually, but the plastic bag works fine at protecting the purple case from getting scratched!"

Here's an idea I got from my aunt:  
  
Have two small, square baskets in the bathroom that guests would use. One basket has neatly arranged washcloths; the other is for discarding them. Get two nice decorative baskets and label them ""Fresh Hand Towels"" and ""Laundry"". You can get cheap washcloths from Target or wherever and roll them up, lined in rows. It's a surprisingly comforting experience when you're a guest at someone's house."

md619,AskMen,1391051704.0,"What you have to understand is the average man being in a monogamous relationship is not the same as a relatively attractive girl being monogamous.

As a guy, we mostly still have to do all the approaching and pursuing, even if the girl is interested in you. Once you become monogamous, you usually stop doing all that. You would have to go out of your way to cheat.

For an attractive girl it's different. Men are still going to approach and pursue her regardless of her relationship status. What that translates to is that *she has more opportunities to cheat*.

Say a couple gets into a big fight. The man goes out with his buddies to a bar. They spend the night drinking and bitching about their relationship. There's a few pretty girls at the bar but like most guys he's too afraid to approach them. Besides, he's so upset he can't even imagine being in a mental place of being able to flirt. He eventually goes home and forgives his girlfriend.

Same situation, but now from the girl's perspective. She goes out to a bar with her friends. They drink and complain about their relationship. There's a cute guy at the bar but she never would go say anything. Suddenly, Mr. Cute Guy comes walking up to her. He's charming, funny and giving her all these good feelings she isn't getting from her boyfriend right now. She knows she shouldn't cheat but he's hitting all the right buttons and in a moment of weakness she gives in.

I'm not trying to say men are more loyal than women. I'm also not saying this is what happens every time you have a fight with your girlfriend. I'm just saying that's the nature of what it means to have sexual options and being the reactionary sex. Everyone can be seduced. Everyone can make mistakes in the moment. "

You should raise and lower your standards. I'm not saying you should be desperate. The moment you feel yourself giving into someone stop. Don't. That could be your buddy, a chick or whomever. Raise your standards to never put up with someone who treats you like shit. No matter how hot or ""friendly"", they're not worth it.

However, I do mean go to the bar and flirt with every girl,then see who responds. If you lower your standards so that you're talking to every girl, then see the reality of who responds, THEN go from there, you'll be more successful.

When I say ""lower your standards"" I don't mean take anything you can get. I mean be open to everyone. See reality first, then choose. If a girl isn't interested, that's just the reality. Don't put her in your pool of choices. But if you are willing to consider everyone, then figure out who might be interested, you'll narrow your choices to people who are responsive.

Don't choose then expect reality to work itself out. See reality first, then make your decision."

alarmingpancakes,acturnips,1391051892.0,"OP have you EVER hosted for selling turnips? Do you realize how grueling it is? People say it's to make a profit. Hardly the case at all. My first time hosting, I spent 10 hours straight letting people in and out of my town, with no breaks and half of them didn't even tip at all. Not only that, but not even a thank you or goodbye from the non-tippers, they just left. I didn't watch TV, I wasn't browsing the internet having fun, I was helping the community. Why, you may ask? Because so many times, have they helped me, by letting me into their towns to let me sell turnips.

When someone opens up their town to you, you follow their rules. No matter what they are, or you can just not visit. It's that simple. Nobody is forcing you to go over there to sell your turnips, take up the OPs time, hold up the line, and make MILLIONS. That's all you, bro. 

Rules such as: 

- Follow the paths

- Don't talk to my villagers

- Don't steal or trample flowers.

- Don't cut any trees.

- Don't dig up things.

They shouldn't be question, the OP has a reason and even if you don't care about how your flowers, trees, town, or villagers look or act, that doesn't give you the right to mess with theirs because YOU don't see why. Just nod you head, sell your turnips, and leave. 

I hate when people come over and talk to my villagers, because I am really invested with them, sure it's a game, but it's MY game, and that doesn't give you a right. I let people in to sell turnips again, just a few days ago, and all my villagers ever want to talk about is how so and so is such a bell pincher. Do I care about somebody I am never gonna see again? No, so stop talking to my villagers and just let me help the community. "

Porn, I wouldn't mind, but a real human being in the room, hell no.

If you don't have the skill to be paid minimum wage you won't get hired. If minimum wage disappeared people could get low paying jobs and get on the job training, which could then lead to something better.

redditerrrr,xxfitness,1391052051.0,"Yay, I can help.  I just finished exclusively breastfeeding my own giant baby.  Like you, worked out the whole pregnancy (kick-boxed till 7 months, ran til 8.5 months, lifted on my due date).  About 2 weeks into the whole mommy thing I started paying attention to me, and I was starving!  Starving and so thirsty.  So, after figuring it out at home for 12 weeks and figuring it out at work for the rest of the year, here is what you are missing.  Snack between lunch and dinner.  This was my most crucial snack of the day, it was almost a second lunch for me.  It got me to dinner without starving and after dinner I was full and satisfied so there was no reason to fill up more on bad snacks.  In my humble opinion, it isn't worth the stress/time/energy to count calories on anything while nursing (at least not in the first 6-7 months).  Just make good choices on foods and let your body tell you when to stop eating.  It's hard to overeat on fresh produce and lean protein.  

I surrounded myself with nuts, dried fruit, and produce (fresh when I was home, bags of decent frozen veggies at work).  I'm not a huge grain eater, but I started craving raisin bran.  I went with it.  If I couldn't have my afternoon snack at work, I would have a bowl of cereal when I got home, then have dinner 2 hours later.

On that note, why are you skimping on lunch?  Soup is not going to get you the calories your body wants.  Have you tried a solid ""meat and two veggies"" meal at lunch?  I wouldn't have been able to get by without it.

It's pretty unbelievable how much energy nursing takes from you.  I never would have believed it before I experienced it myself.  And once I got serious in the gym again and was still nursing exclusively, there wasn't enough water in the world.  I swear I was putting down 20 oz an hour at work.  "

GympieGympie,MapPorn,1391052319.0,"Whoa whoa whoa...people up north cancel school because of *heat*??  REALLY?

Southern Tennessee, here.  I have never even heard of school being cancelled because of heat.  Ever.  And triple digit days with high humidity are fairly common every single summer here.  

And just to reiterate what you said, up North the roads are perfectly safe to drive in, even with snow, because of the lower temperatures, and the plows, salt trucks, etc.  Your roads are clear.  They don't ice, they just get the snow removed or whatever.  

Here they can't do that.  After our Snowmageddon yesterday, I have seen one plow, and two salt trucks.  That's it. There were 154+ reported accidents yesterday in my city alone.  All because of people sliding on snow and ice.  And then, you know what happens?  That snow and ice melts during the day, then refreezes at night.  Meaning work done the day before to clear the roads can be absolutely wasted if the conditions are right. 

Next time anyone laughs at how the South handles snow, I'm going to laugh at how you handle heat.  Oh?  It got over 90 and you don't have an AC unit in your house?  Sucks to be you.  I've never had that problem.  "

Semiconductors are a more complicated case. Non-metals can conduct through transfer or electrons, ions or both. In many ceramic electron conductors, you have subtle changes in cation valence allow for easy transfer of electrons. Semiconductors use electrons or holes crossing what is called the band gap to conduct. When a non-metal conducts with ions, it usually uses small imperfections in the crystal lattice to transmit ions (usually oxygen ions) through the material.

Non-metal conduction is a difficult and multi-faceted topic."

virusered,AskReddit,1391052628.0,"I'mma cheat (a lot) here and say that my favorite ""song"" over 6 minutes is an album.

The Suburbs by Arcade Fire. I got into the band (this album, specifically) because it won album of the year in 2011, and I had heard a few songs on the radio.

I didn't fully realize the effect I'm about to describe until around the third listen (I used it to study, whatever). You've got to do it sequentially, or else you can't even see the song as it is. Lyrics are recycled and restructured in other parts, but it's not a simple recycling of words. The themes conveyed by the lyrics and the atmosphere in which they are delivered create a compelling feeling of cohesiveness to the whole thing. Combined with all of maybe 3 or 4 hard breaks in the music throughout, it literally seems as one if you don't know there's a  tracklisting. So my argument is that the album **is** one song, both thematically and musically. Taken individually, you do yourself a disservice, because the ""message"", or rather *feeling* is lost when separated. Loneliness, hopelessness, nostalgia, wonder, desperation, and a sense of longing for more than what you've been born with. That's what I got, but I could have missed Arcade Fire's point (not that I care). I recommend any of you to give it a listen, if you have the time, and don't mind it being indie rock.

I really couldn't give a shit if you dislike this album, but I also recommend doing this to any album you like in general. It feels better to me to be able to hear and feel *all* of what an artist felt when recording or writing an album. It can help you to better *feel* or understand the artist **artistically**.

This doesn't work particularly well with mass-produced pop music. (Pop here meaning music which is *designed* to be popular, not music which is popular.)

Mephrael,AskReddit,1391052629.0,"The trouble for me was in escalating situations where the GM was trying to 'challenge' other characters (his own NPC included), if I was off the curve even slightly, a challenge would quickly become an unwinnable scenario. 

The highlight was in playing D&amp;D 3.5 using the monsters as players ruleset, I was fielding a Chaotic Neutral Imp with invisibility upscaled as a natural ability, six levels of rogue and a flyby attack, all condoned by the GM

Do you normally have your glasses on when you first go to meet someone, or do you normally wear contacts?   Which ever you are more likley to be wearing when you first meet is what should be your primary profile photo.   

Beyond that.. excellent selection of photos and environments, showing various forms of leisure you enjoy and multiple sides of who are you.. well done.

**self summary**

Excellent.   I've been told it is something of a Colorado thing that nearly the first getting to know you question is ""what sports do you do"" and you've answered that as well as building a good picture of who you are.

**what I am doing**

Too much packed  into one paragraph.. break it up to more than one, and perhaps mention where you volunteer.  What causes are important to you say a lot about you.

**good at**

Not bad.. freestyle dancing only, or can you swing, jitterbug, or other dances with actual steps?  This section seems light after the amount in the previous two.   Not necessarily bad as is, but a little more fluff could help.

**first things**

Yep.. that works, and I think your pictures will support that statement.

**Favorites**

Good list, nice use of white space, but you're really weak on food.   

I like to think that a list of favorite foods is one spot in your profile that a prospective partner can imagine inserting themselves into the picture and eating with you, so offering up favorite cuisines, dishes or even local restarants can give them that hook to start thinking of being with you.

I could be totally off base with that line of thinking, but it just strikes me as an opportunity missed when that section is weak.

**six**

not a bad list, espcially for an author

**thinking**

weak, really, really weak.   

Don't just say *My story, and where I could take the characters.* actually put a current story decision in as an example.. 'should my protagonist climb the cliff or hike around the long way to get to the ruins he glimsed from the boat?'

*Others in need.* Go back to what cause(s) you volunteer for.   What are you passionate enough about that it occupies the front of your brain when you're out for a walk?   

**typical friday**

Did you just start to run out of steam?? REALLY WEAK.  You're a storyteller, tell a story and try to make it a story that your prospective date can insert herself into.

You're not just out at the club dancing your butt off with your friends, you're at a retro disco bar doing the electric slide.. something that's you all over (whatever that may be).

**private thing**

Excellent.. brevty is your friend here because that's just enough to pull the reader in and make them want to ask you how that happened and hot it turned out.

**Message me**

cloudynights,ADHD,1391052726.0,"I was in the same spot you we're in before I started getting help for my depression and ADHD-PI. Someone mentioned dopamine levels, and honestly that's pretty true. Too little dopamine for too long will obviously make someone depressed.

As someone who is working to get them self out of the same rut..don't try to reflect back. Wallowing in your past mistakes in an attempt to try to forgive yourself can only, in my opinion, make things worse for your self-esteem. You need to **move forward, one (tiny) step at a time**, instead of looking back. *You cannot undo what you've done, but only the frustration from it as fuel to start improving*.

See a psychiatrist and work on getting into therapy. Try to see if the dr. that diagnosed you in the past has any records about it that he can send to your new psychiatrist. At this point, I personally think that making sure you start with a psychiatrist and start medication triumphs over therapy; but I'm not saying therapy isn't needed. But, for me, starting my medication and having it kick in as I'm waiting for a therapist to have an open spot(and my insurance doesn't cover any private therapists, so it's been nearly impossible to find a therapist in a clinic that isn't full)..I think I'd make more progress now that I'm improving on my psychiatric illnesses(ADHD-PI, depression, social anxiety(depression and social anxiety has been tremendously helped for my by an SNRI and Adderall) and agoraphobia(I'm noise sensitive, loud constant noise will give me huge migraines. as a result, I fear large crowds and fear going out to somewhere with large crowds. While the fear has lessened, since I'm noise sensitive anyway I don't make it a habit to go to a mall on a crowded day, or a club.)). I can look back at what I've done and I don't wallow in the thoughts that I'm a messup(in a sense of getting a panic attack from it, or it ruining my self-esteem).

Any change isn't going to happen overnight; but you can change if you just move forward and progress. Looking back, right now for you, and trying to forgive yourself may just make things worse. Just use your past as fuel to start working on improving, slowly. For me, dwelling on my mistakes and issues in an attempt for forgiviness never went anywhere. Only until I stopped thinking I had to forgive myself for all of it, and that I had to make progress for myself..was I able to start improving."

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1391052798.0,"From my understanding, each block is composed of numerous transactions.  Each of this transactions must be verified.  This process involves 'unencrypting' the signed message using the public key.  A miner must do this for several transactions, add a value called the noonce to it, then take a hash of all those transactions.  The resulting output of the hash is &lt; 0000000FFCCAAB143 or whatever, then it becomes 'valid'.  The nonce is the random number added to the string of transactions such that it changes the hash output.  If you get a value that is too high, you must guess a new nonce and rehash.  

Simultaneously, if a new block or set of transactions hits the network, it is now very easy to determine if it is legitimate.  Just try taking a hash of the string with the nonce value.  If the hash is incorrect, then we throw out the transaction entirely.  If it is correct, then we go into checking all the transactions to see if they are all legit.  If that passes, we add the block to the chain and start working on the next block.  The key here is, with lots of computing power, we can throw out bad transactions easily.  Guessing the correct nonce value is difficult, but verifying the proof of work is easy, especially with large sums of computing power, which then makes the network difficult to attack."

The Court based its ruling on the provisions of the First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment.

The result is the poor, tiny, insignificant humans caught in it are destroyed, and the ones who witnessed are driven incurably insane.

So in this video, the barrier between worlds opens at that pool, and the laws of physics are warped. Thought becomes horrible reality, and the couple's sexuality is exaggerated by twisting him into a giant dick monster, and her into a hungry, hollow cavity needing to be filled.

**Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome**: The individual has an XY pair but is insensitive to the effects of the masculinizing hormone androgen.  The chromosome send the signals for male development but for some reason the fetus ignores them and continues developing as a female(masculinization usually begins in the ninth week of gestation).  Individuals with CAIS are infertile. They may have a functional vagina(i.e the ability to orgasm) but will usually be missing a uterus and cervix.  They have non functional testes which haven't descended(they are where the ovaries should be).  They also don't menstruate(no uterus) or develop secondary sex characteristics(like pubic hair).  CAIS is virtually impossible to diagnose before puberty.

How many bars, clubs, restaurants, Attractions, museums, concerts, and people are around you? Lots huh?

When you live in Wyoming, true Wyoming, not in Jackson (which unless you make almost 7 figures you'd have a hard time finding property) There is **a** bar which is also the restaurant... and sometimes the strip club on weekdays. 

Cheap places do not look like this, they are in the flatland's, and empty grassy plains. It gets cold in the winter time, the wind is constant, and unless you **REAAAALLLLYYYYY** love the outdoors it is hard to find things to do.

Wyoming is easily in the top 5 most beautiful states... but there is a reason it has the lowest population in the U.S. Sit down and think of why that is.

I knew a Girl from Sacremento who lived here for one year, she was done. She ran out of things to do so moved back home.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391053830.0,"The fact that the ultimatum many seem to face nowadays is work in the rich man's factories or starve. And that your principles ultimately keep people in a form of dependency. 

May I ask you to consider reading Marx's criticisms of capitalism? Don't get me wrong, I'm not a marxist and don't propose revolution or state ownership of the means of production, since that just led to more tyranny, but I think that he did a good job in explaining some of the problems with how capitalism works, and what's wrong with it at the very least. 

Point is, anarcho capitalism's main flaw relies on the disctintion between violent coercion and other forms of coercion. Forcing someone via violence to be a slave is bad, but structuring the system in a way to encourage dependence on the owners of property and means of production via property rights and being given no other option other than to accept exploitative terms or starve, is really almost the same thing. it's just that you replace active coercion with passive, structural forms of coercion, and then give people the illusion of freedom by claiming that the actions are voluntary, when they're really made under duress just like someone with a gun against their temple would.

Anarcho capitalism really ignores passive forms of coercion and ends up being an exercise in defining their way around the problem and giving legitimacy to such an oppressive system. "

I just have problems with a system where money is funneled to the top and the people on the bottom are exploited and abused.

miked4o7,politics,1391054082.0,"There's no evidence that I've seen that indicates a minimum wage hike from 7.25 to 10.10 would have much of an effect on employment levels, even though it's larger than a 10% raise.  Of course, there's nobody saying here that there's no limit to how much you can raise the minimum wage without really hurting employment levels.  Simply that there's no evidence that this kind of raise would produce large negative effects.


&gt;Businesses don't typically run at a fixed capacity, and operations can easily be scaled back should, all else being equal, costs rise. The incentive here is for businesses to downsize their operations, slash hours, lay off workers, and so on if the magnitude of the increase is not small. (I'm really not sure why you anticipate businesses to just eat less profits -- in the event of a small increase, additionally, a firm would likely be able to pass on most of the additional costs to its customers.) When we are talking about labor-intensive industries with razor-thin margins, hikes will definitely be felt.

It's not that it would never happen in any case, just that the threat is **way** overstated.  For one, in most industries, the labor costs are not primarily allocated in minimum wage labor.  According to the BLS, only 2.3% of the labor force is employed at minimum wage (with a total of 5% either at or *under* the minimum wage, but those workers making under minimum wage would take separate legislation to raise their rates).   So you're looking at less than 3% of employees who are getting a full 25% raise.  Also, yes I do think that lots of companies would let it eat out of their profits as long as there was ample competition in their industry.  Most companies would rather lose some small percentage of profits than take a risk at losing a large percentage of marketshare to somebody willing to undercut them.

I'm sure you can find some anecdotal evidence of some CEO saying he's going to have to lay off some big chunk of work force if this ""unfair/oppressive"" minimum wage raise is passed, but there's really no way of arguing this would have a large impact on employment levels as a whole.

Freshmen year of college I was roomed with an athlete who played football and basketball (This was a big D1 state school). I was a 5'10 white kid and this guy was 6'6 and black (relevant later). We eventually switched rooms (it worked out better for both of us) but in the few months we roomed together I really really was trying to impress him. He was a nice enough guy but we didn't see much of eachother as we had different friends/interests. 

One night on like a Tuesday I was bringing this girl from downstairs into the room at about 1:30AM. He was asleep, facing the wall. We hurriedly did it in my bed then she went to go the bathroom. I thought we were quiet enough and that he had slept through it, but when she left to go the bathroom he quietly whispered ""My Nigga""

What it comes down to, is that Dota is a game that takes an incredibly long time to learn and get good at, but in the end because of that turns out to be one of the most complex games out there. Simply put, it will never get old. 

There's ~110 different characters, EACH with 4-7 different spells, with ~80 items you can purchase with different effects/stats. It's a game that requires you to sink a massive amount of time into learning, but in the end comes out being an incredibly fun experience.

Imagine playing a game of chess, but with five players on each team all with different piece abilities and everyone moves at the same time."

xthorgoldx,TheRedPill,1391054205.0,"No, the whole point of society is *not* to be selfish. Capitalism is the lesser of all evils in that it's the only economic system that isn't doomed to immediate failure and has some semblance of fairness for most of the people involved (compare American capitalism to Russian Marxism; it doesn't work all the time, but at least it works *most* of the time).

Altruism is survival if you understand that ""survival"" is impossible for individuals. You *will* die. I *will* die. Anything we do in the dash between the day we're born and the day we die is a struggle  to delay the inevitable - we eat food so that we won't starve to death *today,* we find shelter so that we won't freeze *today,* even though we're going to die in a week, a month, a decade, or a century.

So why do we struggle? Why fight the inevitable? Because *life* exists to survive, and life is independent of individuals. You exist because your ancestors acted to keep two things alive:

* Genetic lineage. By surviving as an individual long enough, you'll give birth to individuals that will outlast you and carry on your biological heritage.
* Memetic lineage. Just like how physical traits are encoded in DNA, your *mental* traits are encoded in your memetics. What is a person if not the product of his experiences and norms? You are the product of the lessons taught to you by your parents and the customs taught to you by your society, and you'll pass those customs and behaviors on to your children *and the children of your society* (you can contribute to survival *without* having kids). 

Because survival is defined by *lineage* rather than the *individual,* traits that promote altruism are more likely to be expressed than traits that promote selfishness. Now, the reason you see selfishness and greed is because individual survival is still important enough to pressure its own advantage traits - being selfish and cruel to your fellow man can, to an extent, help you survive as an individual. The key point is that a society that is made *entirely* of people who lack altruistic traits, such as one seen in an Objectivist model, **is doomed to die.**

It's the nature of humans to be altruistic because it's the only way we can survive more than 80 years. We pass on our genes, which live on in our descendants. We pass on our ideas, which live on in our society. Altruistic ideas are our nature because they're the most conducive for societal continuity, even if they sometimes compromise individual continuity (a society values heroic sacrifices; as a result soldiers will be willing to let themselves die if it means saving their comrades, which is a beneficial trait).

In other words, imagine it this way: imagine a society to be a human, with people making up its individual cells. The society might develop traits that aren't beneficial to individual cells, but bring an overall benefit to the organism as a whole. If every cell was to only act in its own benefit, the society would wither and die (and with it, the individuals - humans are not independent creatures).

In a capitalist society, the point is not to be *selfish* but to be invested in your own survival. In other words, a capitalist society strikes the balance between communism (in which the good of the whole is always higher priority than the individual) and anarchy (in which the good of the individual is always higher priority than the society). Capitalism allows for humans to fulfill their instincts for biological survival while simultaneously contributing to societal survival - communism fails in that it fails to acknowledge the individual's importance, anarchy fails in that it fails to acknowledge the society's importance.

The point of capitalism isn't to be *selfish,* it's to be selfish *enough* that you don't drop dead in service to the state but simultaneously aren't killing your neighbors for their stuff."

...No, with all due respect, they aren't.  The poster didn't say ""we don't all deserve a good afterlife"", they said ""we all deserve Hell"", which is a place of suffering.

There's a big difference between ""you don't belong in the good place"" and ""you belong in a bad place"".  The possibility for a middle-ground should exist, no?

So $16 a cycle (if Its light) I get a cycle every 1.5 weeks, 20 cycles a year, $320 a year just to bleed on something and throw it out.

Of course thanks to implanon I bleed every single day, If I was still using pads that would be $480 a year.

And Almost Uber Light decks aren't as light as advertised, they chip easily, and weigh pretty much the same as some 7 ply maple decks.

The most you should pay for a deck is 50$, maybe 55$ - 60$ if it has 'special technology' (a lot of technology has come and go over the years, P2 and Impact decks seem to be some of the more legit technologies that are lasting and being bought again).  

And the weight of your skateboard deck doesn't really matter too much, the wheels and trucks are where most of the weight in the setup comes from.  If you have hollow trucks your board shouldn't weigh much regardless of brand and size.  

Speaking of size, the larger your deck is (wider), the more material it takes to fill that area, and on average wider decks usually weigh more, and larger wheels weigh more than smaller wheels.  The differences in weight are small though.  "

That feels good, and it can be like a drug, especially for women.

Ultimately, if she really had feelings for you and was attracted to you, you'd be dating. As it stands, she just likes you enough to be close to you, but not enough to actually date you - and apparently she's not attracted enough to you to have physical/sexual urges, either.

What I'm trying to say is that this is never going to be a thing. Nothing is ever going to happen between the two of you.

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1391054555.0,"It's not hard to make coils if you have a little hand-eye coordination and something to coil around.  Lots of people use small drill bits, I personally use my small screwdrivers to coil on.  There are lots of videos on YouTube showing microcoils made on a rod of some type.  Some people coil right on to their wick, but that never turns out as well for me.

As far as your definition of best, it's a balancing act.  Bigger clouds are made with higher VG juice and more airflow.  Flavor is increased with higher PG and less airflow.  On a mech lower resistance coils heat faster and hotter, but drain batteries quicker.  Obviously bumping power up on a VV/VW device has a similar effect.

If you're making your own coils you should have a basic understanding of Ohm's Law and something like www.ohmslawcalculator.com for reference.  Personally I find that 0.6 to 0.8 ohms on my mech gives me my best flavor, right around 20 watts with a nominal charge, but pushing 30 watts at a fresh 4.2 volts on a 0.6 ohm coil.  Of course some people like higher resistance and some like lower...  And sometimes different toppers work best with coils that don't work as well in others.

There are many options, but if you want to get into flavor and clouds by making your own coils then I recommend starting with a dripper to learn coils, then maybe a mech mod after you're comfortable figuring out what kind of power you like and how Ohm's Law works."

To be fair, I thought the same thing. I only found out about applicators a few years ago when I joined Reddit, I heard about cardboard ones which are obviously disposable, so when someone mentioned plastic I too assumed they were reusable and you could just carry an empty one around and then load up a reglar tampon.

I wish they did make reusable ones. In Australia all I can ever find is cardboard or applicator-less. I've never bee able to use tampons, I don't really care any more because I have other methods now, But still, it seems like a good idea."

Also, this is a show about people with emotions and feelings. By that point, Ivanova has already been established as Jewish as well. Are you really surprised that a Jewish person takes God somewhat seriously?

Religion is a deeply ingrained part of culture - for the aliens in the series as well as how it affects people in real life. (See how much you are confounded by its inclusion, as opposed to its exclusion?) I think it gives the show a beautiful sense of realism, and adds degrees of believability. Because really, at the end of the day, aren't they all searching for universal messages and truths? And isn't that what religions do?

Wealth, although goods and services in some sectors.

&gt;When the government distributes wealth it is over as far as I am concerned. Then you have an authoritarian government. A dictatorship. Totalitarianism. Despotism.

I disagree. And I also think that you can have despotism in ""free market"" society too. or do I need to quote Mussolini again? Totalitarianism has little to do with economics per se. You can have it on the left and the right. You can also have democratic societies that redistribute wealth, and the US and other first world countries do this too. I actually want what's known as ""social democracy."" I'd say Scandinavia (norway, sweden, etc.) is closest to the kind of government I'd favor.

I understand you don't like marxism. I get it, but it's not the only form of dictatorship nor is it the one I feel we should be most concerned about. When I really dissect my worldviews, I'm actually more concerned about fascism rising in America than communism.

JustinJamm,Christianity,1391054950.0,"Okay, that works. At least, it does on my end.

We're taking two categories: disagreement and rebellion. Disagreement is fine, normal and unavoidable -- even healthy. Rebellion is not.

""Handing Jesus over to be killed for 30 shekels of silver"" is rebellion. Also, ""formally non-assenting to a Church teaching that we believe (in our own conscience) to be unbiblical"" is rebellion.

This means that although I FULLY affirm both the Apostles' Creed and Nicene Creed in their entirety (yes, including ""apostolic"" and ""catholic"") I am FULLY in the Judas category as a human being for openly disagreeing with several of the HRCC's teachings. I am basically all the way over in Judas' spiritual path.

There is a reason they are not as thin as the Janoski.  Cupsole are mainly for huge gaps, you should be fine with a vulcanized shoe for 6 stairs and below.  Basically a cupsole sacrifices boardfeel for extra impact support and cushioning to prevent bruised ankles and other injuries you can get from not having proper cushioning on big gaps...  

Wear whatever you want, everyone has their preference, but look up the difference between vulcanized and cupsole when you get a chance, the review was good other than the fact you compared them to a vulcanized shoe 10 times (which will always be thinner and have more boardfeel than a cupsole). "

steve496,49ers,1391055241.0,"Let me answer the second of those first: just a fan, albeit one with a penchant for research and analysis.  Basically: I don't consider myself to have any particular insider knowledge or expertise; I just spend a fair amount of time reading and thinking critically about the implications.

So to answer your first question: I don't have the slightest idea how hard it is to teach blocking to a RB.  I imagine that, like most things in football, its a mix of coaching, experience, and natural ability, but what the balance is I can only guess.  That said: Gore is one of the very best in the league, so its unlikely that whoever his replacement is will be as good.  Whether they're ""good enough""... talk to the 49ers coaches, as I suspect they're the only ones that know.

Its also worth noting that we may wind up making some scheme changes when we move away from Gore.  [This article](https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2013/12/12/signature-stats-pass-blocking-efficiency-rbs-and-tes/) is interesting with regards to pass blocking in general, but of particular note is the observation that we're one of very few teams that regularly send our FB out in a pass pattern while keeping our RB in to block; I suspect that's largely due to Gore's excellence in pass blocking, and it would not surprise me if we shift to a more conventional approach as we start utilizing other backs.  Then again, Tom Rathman was quite an active receiver as a FB back when he was a player, so maybe not.  Point is: Gore's replacement doesn't have to be a drop-in replacement in all aspects of the game; he just needs to be good enough at enough things that we can adjust our scheme to make use of strengths and avoid weaknesses."

Working an entry level mcjob was never intended to support a family or even more than one person.

No where did I say they should do what I did. I said people seem to give up to easy or make poor choices then blame everyone around them. Nobody even needs a college degree to earn a livable wage.

This idea is consonant with the mechanical design, which starts to approach the fundamental ideas of interactivity as an art form.  Your experience as a player mirrors and is supported by the narrative and thematic context; knowledge is power.

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1391055266.0,"Tmi time but i just got out of the hospital for the same thing.

I was totally scared of sex. 

The only thing that helped was having a serious discussion with my SO, having a game plan, taking it slow, and just doing it.  It was weird because i both wanted him and didn't want him because i didn't want to go back to the hospital.  I keep trying to remember all the good things about sex in our relationship and the first few times we both approached it as a clinical experiment just to get back in the vibe.

Also, and this was partly my issue according to my physical therapist, but having a UTI longer than usual can cause the pelvic floor muscles to cramp or spasm and be in this state of dysfunction, causing pain during intercourse. Do you have a  PT you can talk to? I got a few PT sessions from the hospital to make sure everything was ok, and some muscle relaxers to go with it (which messes up orgasms but hey)."

fortuna_spins_you,AskWomen,1391055315.0,"I work in the design field. I feel like the biggest problem with online dating is the vast majority of online dating sites are designed by men. The result is they are very algorithm driven, which isn't a bad thing, but it is basing it off of how men evaluate a potential mate, not women.

I think for women, it would need to be more event and interest based. The meeting of someone would need to come before the messaging. This would probably benefit a lot of men who feel they are dismissed because of competing ""useless"" messages and being dismissed by their looks. I'm not exactly sure how this kind of thing could be done, but I see potential in an app that aggregates events at local bars/clubs/venues or just sports activities/leagues/competitions/conventions but specifically are curated by interest and who is there. I think most people feel like first dates are not really dates, but the equivalent of meeting someone randomly in a bar. I would think that if an app was more event based, it would create more successful real first dates. OKCupid and HowAboutWe is trying to do that, but I think they are taking the wrong approach, for a lot of reasons that could be another entire post.

Your perception of what's attractive is something you can't really help. Your brain naturally looks for specific features in people as well as molds around what you're comfortable seeing or, in other words, society's perpetuation of deciding what's attractive for you.

Thug life hasnt been a legit thing since the 90's and early 2000s. It appears in music occasionally, and when they do it gets confirmed pretty quickly that Rapper X actually wasnt part of a gang.

In connection to that, if you grow up in a hostile environment your options are already limited.

thenseruame,AskWomen,1391055658.0,"Well I was typing this up for the OP, but since he apparently deleted this while I was typing I'll put it here.  I already went through the hassle of typing it out and I'll be damned if I let that go to waste.

To OP:
I assume you're asking this because you aren't getting any dates.  I know this is ask women and I'm a dude, but seriously who thinks this way?  If you're not getting any dates have you ever considered it's because you don't put yourself out there?  Relationships don't just happen, you have to make an effort.  If there's a woman you like ask her out, there are only three real possibilities.  

A) She politely declines.  
B) She rudely declines.  
C) She says yes.

For all  three scenario's you're better off than you were before.  Best case scenario you've got yourself a date.   Otherwise you now know where you stand with said woman, which means you can stop fretting over that one individual and move on with your life. If said individual is rude about it then consider it a real win, because that person wasn't very nice in the first place and no sane person wants to date an asshole.

Also being nice does not mean being a pushover.  Women are people too and to quote Romany Malco, ""stop putting the pussy on the pedestal"".  If you're going out of your way to do ""nice"" things for women in an attempt to get a date/laid it's pretty obvious.  It doesn't look ""nice"" it looks weird and potentially creepy.  

Everyone suffers from a lack of confidence now and then.  It's easier said than done to get over it, but honestly you need to affect a slightly more apathetic attitude and just say fuck it sometimes.  Who cares what some stranger thinks of you?  If you're a good person someone else's opinion can't take that away from you.  "

Legend of Cao Cao is part of a series of games Koei made back in the 90s, primarily for the computer (though I believe they may have ported them to other consoles). They were never released in English, so someone took it upon herself to translate the latest game in the series (and only one available for Windows PC vs. DOS) into English.

The story follows Cao Cao from the Yellow Turban Rebellion and splits roughly around the time of Mt. Dingjun depending on choices made in the story. It roughly follows Romance of the Three Kingdoms and includes over 20 party members and many different unit types (infantry, cavalry, archers, mounted archers, various kinds of strategists, etc.).

It's got a huge modding scene in China even to this day. Feel free to read more about it; the download is free, as Koei no longer enforces its copyright to the game and has even acknowledged the modding scene."

While that can be true and is true a lot of the time, feminism really is just about women's rights. It's some of the feminists that bring about that definition. Reddit feels that feminism is a sexist movement.

I identify as an egalitarian if anything, but I am a feminist in some ways. However, I don't care all that much for sexualization. Women are objectified and subsequently raped because of it, but embracing sex in culture is a great thing and if they care so much about the unbalance, they should start watching more porn."

oldmonty,AskReddit,1391056027.0,"You hit the nail on the head, this is exactly my philosophy and even though I'm quite new at it I am also a doctor. 

The thing is that most people who are chronically dehydrated have learned to tune out the feeling of being thirsty and thus ""only drinking when they are thirsty"" becomes ""only drinking when they realize they are thirsty"". If you ask someone like this if their lips are dry they will probably go ""hey yea, I'm actually thirsty"". 

This is compounded by the fact that, at least in America where I live, people are likely to reach for a soda or juice or beer when they feel thirsty which will trick them into thinking they are fully refreshed when their body actually needed more.

When recommending a constant x number of glasses a day the doctor assumes you won't stick to the exact number but increase you amount by a bit to bring you into the proper range further it tries to drive you away from non-water drinks. It's easier to tell someone to do something x times than to explain to them how to self regulate. "

They don't belong in zoos. We know it, they know it. It just isn't right. And I am not typically one of these uppity types about it.

Craftable/Dyable barding.  At the moment there are only a few sets of relatively unique barding, but when there are only a few options, the uniqueness is gone.  A huge expansion of barding options (hopefully in combination with Chocobo breeding) would be great for getting that perfect Choco companion.

Fighting on Chocoback.  The whole ""companion"" system needs to be revamped a little but I'd love this.  It needs to be balanced well - some kind of risk/reward or pros/cons so that the entire population of Eorzea isn't permanently on their chocos, but for certain activities like FATE parties, Leves or Hunting Logs it would be really fun.

Minion Buffs/Abilities.  Different minions could add small bonuses to gathering and crafting, or perhaps even combat.  A baby Peiste that increases HQ chance when mining, or a little Buzzard that boosts your fishing, a special Cactuar that gives you a CP boost when weaving (because needles)?  For combat a variety of minions could boost stats or give you special abilities, or maybe even give you a Cross-class ability slot for a Class that you wouldn't normally have access to otherwise.  Having a minion for this would stop class balance in dungeons from getting messed up.

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1391056139.0,"As a white, cis woman i really don't like discussing privilege with people because they are all, ""yeah you're white too."" This usually happens when i talk about how i feel about Lena Dunham. I think she is representative of a certain social class i cannot identify with as my family are all high school dropouts from the south, but i am still a fat white chick so eff me, right? So i just give up.  I really just save my deep thoughts on privilege for discussions with my boyfriend or my best friend.

It also really bothers me when people who have obviously benefitted from privilege say that they don't have privilege any more.  A good example would be a cis white woman who converts to Islam saying that she totally gets oppression now because of her headscarf or because she married a brown guy.  That isn't how privilege works.  She is still white and and can still take off her headscarf and she still grew up with the educational and financial benefits of being white and from a certain social class.

I don't even know why i am saying this, i hate talking about privilege because it always turns into these intellectual circlejerks where everyone wants to convince the others of their point of vew.

The cross is the religious extremism it supports.

The flag is how the discourse regarding wealth distribution is poisoned by cashing in on fears of communism. Once a valid threat against the US, but now our positions are strawmanned and undermined and we are deemed as unpatriotic. I'm sorry, but all that stuff about how mild forms of redistribution is literally the same thing as the communist regimes you fought? It's all propaganda, and that propaganda is in place to protect certain corporate interests.

""When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint. When I ask why they are poor, they call me a communist."" --Helder Camara

There's all kinds of middle ground between pure capitalism, and pure communism. As I said, for much of our modern history, we've found a good balance, but this balance has been upset by the right and certain corporate interests funding them.

paytonpls,AskReddit,1391056417.0,"When people tailgate. It's seriously dangerous. One time I was driving, and this guy was tailgating me so bad it was scary. I had to slow down, so I tapped on the brakes and the guy swerved to the right in the lane next to me, drove by me and stuck his head out the window to look at me. He then cut in front in me, and then back in his original lane (The left lane), and was getting ready to turn left. As I passed him, he threw something (I think a foam cup full of liquid) at my windshield. I was surprised it didn't crack my windshield.

What if I had to suddenly come to a full stop? This guy in his big truck would have hit me and probably killed me (The speed limit was 45). I get absolutely enraged and terrified when people tailgate."

Just talk about the scene in any way shape or form, or whatever has been on your mind that's skate related.  It will be a good place to vent about stuff that pisses you off, what's been on your mind, or whatever.

I'm thinking of trying to advocate for a local skatepark since my city doesn't have one, I have been reading the information on www.skatepark.org a lot recently and really don't know many skaters in my area besides a few friends (like 5, 6 including me) since we don't have any skateparks as a place to congregate, there is a skatepark in the next town but it's more of a local town park.  I live in a town of 49,000 people.  And all of the new downtown streets / new construction has skate stoppers included in part of their building plans, all the new ledges downtown are stopped.  There isn't a place to skate safely, just street spots which gets old with being constantly kicked out.  It would be nice to have a skatepark as a meeting place for the skaters in my community.  

Approaching age 22, I'm at the stage where I would rather spend some time in the skatepark and mess around on terrain perfectly suitable for what I'm trying to do, safely, without fear of being kicked out, or worrying about a car hitting me as I land a stair set and roll off a curb, etc...   It's energy draining going out and trying to find embankments, ledges, rails, manual pads, and stairs...  It is really fun but it'd be nice to just have a community hub.  Even to just meet people at the skatepark to go hit up some street spots, make new friends...  

I'll probably start with the 5 skaters I know right now and tell them about my plans for advocacy and we will try and build a network of people that know people, I was reading the more people that go and speak the more your voice is heard, and the more evidence you guys were there.  This will be a long process, but the result is worth it... "

This means they can only enslave the Past, and have some sort of system (kinda Minority Report-ish) that would prevent the Past from committing mass suicide in an attempt to kill the Future. Also, their time machine is broken, so they are stranded in the Past (but shhhhh this is a secret that the Future guards at all cost, this is a major plot twist that happens at some point in the movie)

Enter protagonist. He somehow discovers that he is the great great great great grandfather of the person who ends up building the time machine that enabled the Future to time travel. Something fun plot stuff happens and the plot thickens etc etc. Then the major plot twist at the end is he somehow uses the time machine (which it turns out isn't in fact broken, it can only be used by someone who is from his genetic line, as his great great great great grandson who invited it knew it would be used for evil) to go back into time and kill a Past version of himself, thus preventing the whole future from happening.

Yes, bad relationships can teach you about yourself and what you need, but if you get it right the first time (or just don't wind up with the people in your first few relationships for some reason that doesn't make it a bad relationship) then there isn't anything wrong with that. I haven't really had any bad relationships. I'm civil with all of my ex'es. I've also never had a friend who betrayed my trust. I think being a good judge of character rules, and as attributes go I wouldn't trade it.

I still advise cooking at home, since it's cheaper, but at my shop, at least, we have a good reason for cutting back. Even pizza hut's website will warn you that 5+ toppings won't cook right. I don't work there, so it could be BS but it rings true where I work.

Jourdin,AskWomen,1391056843.0,"&gt; This ""Redpill"" belief is just as damaging as radical feminism, though.

This is ridiculous. If you really think this, please do some more research into the actual theories of radical feminism. Yes, some radfems seem angry and a lot of people think that ""fighting hate with hate"" gets one nowhere (I tend to agree). However, radical feminist theory absolutely cannot be compared to red pill beliefs; they're 100% antitheses to one another. TRP advocates misogyny and keeping the figurative patriarchal boot on the hypothetical necks of women. Radical feminism advocates breaking the chains of misogyny and completely reforming our society from one that is a capitalist patriarchy into something where one's gender does not make one lesser in any way than someone of another gender."

Noumenology,occult,1391057350.0,"similar to what /u/WingedCrown said, I have had personal experiences with the supernatural, and much of my faith is just the memory of those events.

There's also a choice to faith. I have to choose to believe that the events I experienced were real yet not the result of some empirically deductible, rationalist explanation. Kierkegaard called it a [leap *to* faith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_to_faith). But it's not so extreme or crazy as it may sound to the agnostics or atheists. What we believe in, our [*weltanschauung*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview), is often a [social construction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_constructivism) created by our experiences and relationships with others. We may ""believe"" in ideologies like democracy, philosophies like utilitarianism, social norms like mercy, values like ""the golden rule,"" but those things are all constructions - they are the result of a human society which chooses to believe in and have faith in a set of ideas that ""make sense"" of the world.

And this is all we are doing with faith. We are making sense of the world using a symbol set and value system that may be just as arbitrarily derived as any idea or social mores. They resonate with archetypical psychological constructs which reside deep in our subconscious, so faith caries deep and profound meaning for a believer. 

It is most definitely a choice. But it is also a matter of finding the symbols and beliefs that resonate, that inspire the experience for a foundation, that leads you to the choice where you say ""i have faith."" And then the only thing that can change that is a paradigm shift in yourself that illustrates the weaknesses in your understanding of your symbols, your beliefs, and your gods. That's where there are so many atheists out there today. They tried to force themselves to reconcile a 6000 year old earth with introductory geology, and they threw the baby out with the bathwater.

Not to mention once you're moving wheel spin shouldn't be an issue if you're going easy on the gas.  I lived in Vermont for 21 years and from my experience getting going was never really the issue, stopping is where things can get hairy.  Having the engine slow your vehicle down before you apply the brakes really does help.


I now live in the south (Virginia) and I don't think people who've lived in the North understand just how shitty the roads can be in the south.  It's not the amount of snow or ice that's the issue, it's how ill prepared the city/state is to handle it.  When I lived in Vermont I never had to debate whether or not I could drive on the roads.  They were always decently plowed and salted, my Saab 900 and later Toyota Camry never had an issue despite being FWD.  Now that I live in the south it's a serious issue when we get snow because the plow drivers here don't have any idea what they're doing. 

The only time I've ever gotten stuck in the snow was down here when I was backing out of my drive way.  The plow had just come by and while he didn't get all of the snow off the road it looked thin and packed down enough to not be an issue.  Back my car out of the driveway....blam car sinks into four inches of snow.   Took me 30 minutes of digging my car out and rocking it back and forth to get it back into my driveway.  "

The real drama happened when some redditors flipped out, saying that taking down a sub is against reddits policy, that they were censoring free speech, its undemocratic, blah blah. The admins didnt care and have since been a bit stricter with taking down content that breaks laws. The whole drama actually garnered a decent amount of attention for reddit as a whole... Negatively... We were all branded as pedophiles."

flyingcatpotato,AskWomen,1391057382.0,"I see your edit, but there have been a few tangentially related posts this week about penis size if you have a dig around the search bar.

That said, penis size one way or another is not a dealbreaker for me, and my two best lovers except for my current SO both had very small penises (three inch/micropenis range).  I wrote about them in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/1waxd2/so_ladies_is_a_microvery_small_penis_honestly_a/).

Big penises are just big penises for me, but what i like about smaller penises is that i can do more stuff with them.  I have a small mouth and a small vag, so really big dudes hurt, and i can't really give them good blow jobs so they don't like me either.  I love being with a guy who is small enough that i can actually blow him.

My current SO is on the big and girthy side and while i love him and love having sex with him, his penis size limits a lot of what we can do in terms of positions and activities and we have had to work hard to find our own way.  A guy with a smaller penis is probably more suited to my body but we can't choose who we love so we make it happen."

*Do you ever get tired of being home schooled? What causes this?*

Sometimes, but only because I don't really feel like doing my work. But since it takes like 2-4 hours, I should probably stop complaining. 

*In what ways do you meet people and make new friends?*

Clubs, church, your neighborhood, at parties etc. We just have to search out friends. They're not sitting there already haha. 
*Would you say that life is harder or easier?*

Life? A fuck ton easier. 


*How do/did you think people perceive(d) you?*

Nerdy, very sheltered, socially awkward and/or unsocialized - this only applies if they've heard I'm homeschooled beforehand of meeting me. 

*Do/did you have trouble fitting in and making new friends?*

Nope. 

*Do think you would be a different person if you wen't to a public/private school?*

Yeah, probably more slutlike. 
*How do you complete work and how is it graded? Do you have any ties to your local Board of Education?* 

This depends on your country, state, county, and what method you're doing. For 'traditional, mom-is-my-only-teacher' homeschooling, you do have paperwork and school projects to send in. For online homeschooling, as long as you complete the work online (word documents sent in over the website) and complete quizzes and tests, you're fine. You have to submit how much time you spent on each subject every day, but it still is required to record that. For a 'hybrid' program, you have to submit attendance reports like with traditional homeschooling and also complete work that your teachers give you. (for  further definitions on each of these methods, just reply and let me know. I'll comment info here. :P ) 


Hope this helps!

Another possible way about it would be to take the normal ""cannon fodder"" undead and just make some of them intelligent. Zeke, the zombie who prefers fine wines as he plans battles. Sarah, a skeleton who collects the hearts of those she has killed. Gregory, the ghoul who hunts kings. "

I can't really speak much to the second question, although keep in mind that erectile tissue is used to form the clitoris. I'm sure the sensitivity varies (as it does for cis women) - I've definitely heard some post-op ladies say it's way sensitive, though. And others with not as much sensation."

I had this discussion with my last boyfriend a while back.  He was a waiter for years at a very busy bar, and he said that, on average, men were definitely the better tippers.

I tip my hairdresser 20-25%.  At restaurants, I usually tip about 20% for good service - closer to 15% if the service is so-so, closer to 25% if it's great.  At hotels, I park my own car and carry all my own stuff, but if I didn't, I would tip those people.  I do tip housekeeping."

Or perhaps God just could have forgiven you without needing to have Jesus tortured and killed, but just preferred the torture and killing. That denies His complete morality. All I have left is that Jesus had to be tortured to death because Jews at the time only understood atonement through sacrifice, and it was the only way God could think of to convince people to stop burning goats and asses, that the Son of God would be so massive a sacrifice that it covered all sin. I think if God exists and is moral and omnipotent, that he can forgive me without torturing or killing anyone, and therefore Jesus' death was regrettable and unnecessary.

Over the next five years, my desire to have children waned (and my interest in having sex grew) until about the age of 15, when I came to the realization that I'm childfree (and that I was ready to be sexually active, although it would be quite a while before I could find a volunteer to help me with that endeavour.)

That was nearly 20 years ago, and I've been childfree ever since."

TotallyNotSuperman,whowouldwin,1391058020.0,"&gt;Anyways yes it did do a lot that doesn't stay consistent with the rest of their canon, that much is true, however you can't deny that this did happen within the DC universe. Regardless if it doesn't make sense, within the DC universe this happened.

I'm going to boil this down to a question:

If we were talking about the Atom being in a fight, would it be okay for someone to use *Infinite Crisis* as an example of him being beaten by photons? Despite the fact that his mass has *never* shrunk proportionally to his mass? It happened in the DC Universe, so that must be the case, right?

With characters that have been in as many stories as comic book heroes, there are going to be some low showings. But using the absolute lowest that have ever been published is not fair to the character. Wally was never in the habit of running chest first into blades, and Kyle was never dumb enough to get into a boxing match outside of that one issue. That's just not their personalities. 

Sure, Wally can be rash. But *Infinite Crisis* took that to a level that nobody else has ever done. And with six decades of stories, why should the lowest of the low showings define the character?

I also want to point out that Flash has used the speed-steal, time travel, and IMP at *least* has many times as he's gotten stabbed by running into a sword. So if *Infinite Crisis* gets to define the character, then there is zero reason those feats can define him just as much."

Rose_Stone,washingtondc,1391058047.0,"The concrete-column air shaft serves as ventilation for the I-395/Center Leg Freeway/Third Street tunnel, a project that got its start in 1955. The first portion of the project was built 1966-1973 and the second 1979-1982. The project was originally designed to connect all the major highways surrounding D.C., but ended up only connecting I-395 to New York Avenue (Route 50), leading to some of the lovely beach traffic entanglements we experience every summer.

The air shaft was probably part of the 1973 completion, or at least the project is heavily tied to the Nixon’s administration residency in our fair city. It is sometimes jokingly called ""The Nixon Memorial""."

I'm not saying you didn't work hard, and I do congratulate you on being able to find success.  I'm also not saying you are necessarily privileged, just that privilege is a matter of perspective, and even though you may not be rich, there are many people likely poorer than you who have been brought up in environments that make it almost unthinkable that they would ever go to college (as in the thought just doesn't cross their minds).  

I also want to ask if you have any sources for saying that there are many more people who just exploit the system than people who genuinely need welfare.  I'm not trying to be a dick I'm genuinely curious because I've never found any sources to support that statement (seriously I know that sounds pretentious but I promise I""m just trying to learn).  

In addition, getting rid of a welfare system inevitably means that people who no longer have that safety net would suffer, meaning that their children would also suffer, and have less in the way of resources and opportunities to improve their lives.

I'm not saying the system's perfect, it's not, and it needs to be reformed.   But I don't think that justifies getting rid of it entirely."

TotallyNotSuperman,whowouldwin,1391058344.0,"As to the actual fight, here's something you don't seem to realize: Flash can react to things as they happen. If he's moving slowly enough that Spidey could dodge him, Flash could speed up. If Spidey starts shooting web at where he's going to be, Flash can just go in another direction. If Spidey dodges a right hook by jumping to the side, Flash just aims his punch there instead. Flash isn't just a fast runner. He also has reflexes that make Spider-Man's entire powerset irrelevant.

Flash is not set at the speed he starts at, nor is he forced to run in a single direction. If he's not going fast enough, then it is perfectly in character for him to just go a little faster.

And his normal fighting speed is certainly fast enough to beat Spider-Man. He casually dodges projectiles in every fight, so he's obviously going quickly enough to see the projectiles and move away. It's not all reflexive; in a fight, Flash's brain works fast enough to watch bullets come at him in slow motion. Spider-Man is just not fast enough to surprise him."

finalDraft_v012,asiantwoX,1391058408.0,"People commenting on my hair type would be very irritating.  Now, a lot of people, especially non-Asians, think of your typical Asian hair being thin and super straight.  My hair (and I believe many other Asians I've met...Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipinas, etc...sometimes feels like I meet more with wirey/wavey hair than thin and straight!) is stiff yet super wavy too.  My sister's is even more intense; she naturally gets those ""romantic wavy curls"" that many women need curlers for!  My hair can get so poofy if I don't maintain it, it's like I'm wearing an angry octopus on my head.

A typical conversation:

Person: ""Your hair looks great today!""

Me: ""Thanks, I got up early enough to straighten it this morning!""

Person: Makes a weird face.  ""Asian hair is so thin and stick straight already, there's no point in straightening YOUR hair.""

I then wonder if they are blind, because these would be acquaintances or friends I've known for a while, who see me every day....such as classmates.  They should've seen the waves in my hair.  Also I have really thick hair, so neither of their adjectives are descriptive of *my* hair, just the stereotypical Asian's hair. They'd literally not be seeing what is in front of them, only the stereotype.  There's been times too when I hear people having a conversation about frizz control and I say ""Oh, argan oil has worked great for me!""  They disregard what I said because ""You have straight Asian hair, you shouldn't get frizz.""  Except that I do....because of my wavy hair type....

LordOfTheLemon,AskReddit,1391058410.0,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved."

It's ok to be angry, but you aren't allowed to scream and yell. It's ok to feel frustrated, but you aren't allowed to kick or be violent. I talk to my own daughter about it in terms of the type of voice she uses, eg she is not allowed to talk in ""whiney voice"" or a ""grumpy voice"" I encourage her to talk in her ""strong voice"". Saying ""Don't talk in your whiney voice"" is going to leave her feeling better than saying ""don't whine"", I actually find this technique really effective. 

Could it be worth giving her less fibre to help with the poos? Lots of plain rice, bread, bananas, yoghurt and not so much fruit, vegetables and cereals for a couple of weeks might help?

Honda XR250L (the street version of the venerable XR250 enduro bike).   You may find a nice Honda XL250 or XL350 (mid/late 80s models).  

Yamaha XT350 and XT225.  Low maintenance, reliable as a claw hammer.

Someone mentioned the KLR250 - I'd steer clear of the KLR650 as it is heavy and a handful off road even for experienced riders. 

You may luck up and find a nice KTM LC4 400 in that range.

kulkija,MensRights,1391058592.0,"I get what you're trying to say, but I think you're reaching a bit. Particle theory has a lot of unique technical terms because it is incredibly complicated; it involves things which, when they were discovered, we literally had no words to describe.

I won't dispute that there's a lot of professional exclusion in highly technical fields with a lot of jargon, but you can't claim that gender theory has jargon because it's too technical to describe *without* jargon. It has jargon because women's studies majors want to feel special and exclusive, like people in the hard sciences, only with less peer-review.

Gender theory does not really contain any ideas that necessitate new words in nearly the same way as, say, medicine, or chemistry, or physics. IMO it just unnecessarily coins new terms to cover up a lack of real substance. Strong adherents of gender theory have way more in common with radical political activists than they do with scientists, so I don't think your comparison is particularly valid."

Another easy method that costs great and has les sugar than most cheap jarred pasta sauce: one 11 ounce (or whatever size that one is) of tomato sauce, one small (3 ounce I think) jar of tomato paste and some italian seasoning. Done.

Even better than that, although not quite as easy.  Quick boil some plum tomatoes then drop them in cold water to make the skins pull away.  Peel off the skins then mash with your hands.  Mix in some salt and olive oil.  Boom!  Best pizza sauce you'll ever have.

If you don't have plum tomatoes then just use a can of whole San Marzanos.

ManyVoices,AskMen,1391058644.0,"This reminds me of a GREAT analogy. If a key (penis) can open a lot of locks (vaginas) it's a master key. But if a lock can be opened by many keys it's a shitty lock. Societally, men see men who have slept around as champions and someone to admire. Women see women who sleep around as sluts. Maybe this is where your argument is stemming from.


ON THE OTHER HAND... I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that the majority (read as 51% or higher) of sexual encounters are ""allowed"" by women. You can't swim if the pool is closed. So women have more power in the bedroom than men do. But, if you are getting penis-trated by someone, you kinda of have to metaphorically ""sit back and take it.""

yummycorndog,penpals,1391058647.0,Thanks for writing all 29 of those words about yourself on this new account for us!
JustinJamm,Christianity,1391058647.0,"Not to worry! =) I'm a deep believer in process-dialogue, not in getting words right the first time.

Please excuse my verbosity below, but I was earnestly struck by your candor and wanted to share openly myself.

Your comment here looks similar to what I believe. I actually believe very much in humility and obedience too. This *especially* applies when I am relating to someone who knows way more than I do about a topic -- e.g. they are a ""primary source,"" or personally experienced in the matter, or scholarly.

But what if I myself become directly well-versed in a matter, and a known scholar declares something contrary? Take nutrition. I'm no doctor, have no Ph.D., etc, but I have become thoroughly versed in rigorous research of studies that have led to me to eat very differently from mainstream medicine's advice.

**My life is on the line.** I ignore the ""official doctor community"" at my peril. What a fool I would be to casually dismiss them.

However, what if they're wrong, and my research is correct? I ignore that at my peril as well. My life is still on the line!

Similarly, children are to obey their parents in the Lord. What about when the parents aren't ""in the Lord"" and obeying them would result in knowingly sinning? Well, for the child to know that...they'd have to be not-a-child-anymore, to have learned to discern for themselves. And then, ""children...obey"" no longer applies because they're not children.

This shows a transfer of *conditional obedience* -- from obeying ""what righteous authority figures tell us"" to following our conscience because we have internalized moral knowledge and are directly accountable.

---

The same goes for unity. If you are in Christ, and I am in Christ, then we are one. We are one! Even if we don't act like it, we are one! Neither of us can break that underlying reality.

Oh, we can certainly **act** like we're not one. A left arm can lash out at the right arm, or gouge the eyes, or break a toe. But what the left arm does -- or thinks -- cannot stop it from being part of the body [1 Corinthians 12:15-16].

Again, if you are in Christ's heart, then you are also in mine, for Christ is in my heart, and you are in His. And I will see &amp; treat you as such.

Many Protestants treat Catholics as ""in Christ,"" and many do not. But the ""official Catholic position"" (sad to say) seems to be that Protestants are, quite frankly, absolutely-not-in-Christ. 

Yet **I will break bread with you any day, without requiring that you see the bread the way I see it. I know we are one and will never exclude you.**

But apparently the mass is not truly available for me, for I am *required* to see it the way the HRCC teaches. And it is not that I *will* not. Rather, I *CAN* not. I cannot knowingly lie. =( And I cannot reject Christ's body everywhere else I see it because it is not christened, for I cannot lop off Christ's limbs and divide him up so.

For Christ is in all bread shared in compassion with the hungry, and we are all hungry. And to eat the bread unworthily is to eat in such a way as to leave others hungry. [1 Corinthians 11:20,27]

So, who has excluded whom, truly? I do not exclude Catholics, but the RCC excludes me. I know we are one, and though I can treat Catholics as with me in Christ, the reverse cannot be officially extended or Catholics violate their necessary fealty to Mother. (Is that freedom, or chains?)

Who truly breaks the unity, then?

&gt; I would never leave the Church

Neither would I. =) I just think we're *both in it now*, rather than only one of us.

I long to hear your thoughts on this. I do.

About the scriptures you listed:

John 17:21 ~ Jesus prayed for us to be one, that the world will know. If I extent Christ's love to you, and you to me, without attaching marionette strings to each other, the world will know we are His. Will we cut the strings?

1 Corinthians 1:10,11,12 ~ ""I appeal to you...that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united.... What I mean is that each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”"" ~

~ Actually, here I see the RCC as saying ""We follow Cephas. You must follow Cephas with us or you reject Christ's appointment of Cephas and therefore reject Christ, so we cannot both be in Christ."" But I say we are both in Christ. And if we both follow anyone who is following Christ, we are both still actually following Christ anyway.

Romans 15:5-6 ~ Am I welcoming you warmly? Are we living in harmony? Are we agreeing with each other (horizontal, not vertical)?

Ephesians 4 ~ We have one body, Spirit, hope, call, Lord, faith, baptism, God. Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check! Are we *living* as though we do? We are if we practice the ""bond of peace."" Well, I don't feel like we're fighting here, do you?

1 John ~ ummm, maybe responding to this would take too long!

radicalfanatical,AskReddit,1391058683.0,"Speaking as a person with a manic-depressive brother and uncle, I would not wish this disorder on any child or family. It's not something that ""support and encouragement"" can deal with.

EDIT: I'm not making a blanket statement about every case. I only know that my brother's disorder turned an otherwise perfectly normal family into a dysfunctional one. He first manifested signs of it in very early childhood, and would alternate between periods of rage where he would violently destroy things around the property and attack people, and periods of intense sadness where he would stay in his room and cry.

After beginning to medicate, his issues lessened, but instead of anger, he would go through manic periods where he would spend all of his time on various projects (he was a very creative, incredibly smart kid) and would frequently skip meals and stay in the garage tinkering through the nights. He still goes through incredibly low periods of depression.

I don't plan on having children, simply because it's possible that I could pass it on to them. My brother had a hellish childhood, and his life only stabilized after he was out of school. My sister and I were also deprived of a normal upbringing- we couldn't go a week without him having an episode of one sort or another, which meant he monopolized most of the parental attention in the household. He's relatively happy now, but it isn't an experience I'd feel comfortable with putting anyone through, parent, child, or sibling. My parents were not negligent- they were diligent and hardworking, probably some of the best parents anyone could ever ask for, but bringing him up strained them to the point of breaking. They are better people than I'll probably ever be- I could never handle it.

/u/FissurePrice - I'm happy for you and your father. I never meant to imply that it's a condition that can't be helped, or that people with it couldn't lead happy lives. I can only speak from personal experience, and my family's experience was not something that any family should have to have."

frostdallas,AskReddit,1391058692.0,"To make a counter-point, it's not the slavery in and of itself that's the issue. It's the fact that there's a cognitive dissonance in black culture: you came from Africa with an established ancestral culture that existed for thousands of years, but were forced into another advanced one by your captors. Some embrace the ""white man's"" culture, some adhere closely to their homeland, but most are floating in-between, trying desperately to form their own niche in the struggle.

True, the same thing happened to the Irish and Asians, but they had some semblance of European culture. Many Chinese and other asian immigrants were taken from a society that had been technologically advanced enough to establish definite trade routes and have some familiarity with European countries, including their customs and cultural habits. Hell, they were pretty similar in a lot of respects politically. The Irish… well, they're basically the British, so there wasn't much conversion. However the main points were this: Africans were still tribal when most of them were taken. Asians and the Irish were not. That's a major culture shock that you need to consider. Imagine jumping forward 500 years from now into a social structure that's almost completely alien. It'd be a hell of a shift.

I think I see why you might say that, but could you give some examples of what you mean?  It seems to me that the most powerful capital owners generally get to that position through the help of the state and not through their own efforts.

&gt;and are often driven by a profit motive of one kind or another

Most, if not all humans are driven by the profit motive, not just capitalists.  People generally want to maximize their benefits with the least amount of effort possible.  Now, not everyone receives ""profits"" in the economic sense, but the motivation behind them is shared by most people.  Now, this is not inherently a bad thing, but I think we can both agree that what we're trying to prevent is being able to profit at another's expense.  I will agree with you that wage labor in the current economy often involves profiting at another's expense, but I don't see it as the capitalist stealing from the worker so much as taking advantage of their position caused by other factors.

lynn,relationship_advice,1391059106.0,"Be calm and direct. Talk about it in terms of your needs not being met, and approach it as a problem in the relationship, not a problem he has. Ask what he needs you to do in order to get his attention; emphasize that you need his attention. If you're willing to reference this thread, you could say that you described the things he does that you have a problem with to some other people and they said it sounded like he might have ADHD. 

You could also look into [Love Languages](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/) and try talking to him about your needs in those terms. It's a useful metaphor.

On the other hand...I suggest couples counseling whether he has it or not, because you've tried talking to him about it and things are not changing. It's probably a combination of you not knowing how to get his attention and him not putting in the effort to pay attention to you when you directly ask for it (you do say things like, ""I need your attention right now,"" right? Or is there any level of indirection when you ask?). A counselor can help you learn how to get through to each other.

And you can ask the counselor about whether s/he thinks your SO might have ADHD. From what you've described, I'd half expect a counselor to listen for a session or two and suggest him getting checked for it without prompting. But then, I'm primed to see ADHD because I have it, and then there's selection bias, so he could just be a stimulation junkie like my husband but more so, or with less consideration for other people.

* Using low-end feats, no matter how nonsensically low, invites people to throw out obviously bullshit moments to ""prove"" that a character would lose to their favorite character in a fight. Like ""Batman made Darkseid bleed with a kick, so Daredevil would kick his ass"". It's really just fairer to say that everyone is as powerful as their highest feats allow as long as those feats make some degree of sense with the narrative (so Black Panther putting Surfer in an arm-bar is right out).

It was calling to me. Don't ask why because I don't know.

&gt;Do you ever get tired/bored of it?


&gt;Do you ever wish your car was an automatic? 

Yes. Sometimes I just want to get going without worrying if this time I'm going to stall the car or burn up the clutch. I think about my clutch A LOT, even when I'm not driving. If it's not the clutch it's the synchros. There's just a lot of room for errors causing catastrophic damage or least increased wear. You have to try very hard to trash an automatic's transmission whereas I can do it in about 5 minutes in a manual.  I do *not* want to replace the damn clutch after 10-20k miles. 

&gt;Would you recommend it?

What is your normal commute like? Does it involve hills and traffic at the same time? Do you have the money to replace the clutch whenever it finally gives up the ghost? 

I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's the only way to drive or it's sunshine and rainbows. There's a lot of times where it fucking sucks. There's also a lot of times where it's really fun. You need to make the call for yourself."

ixAp0c,NewSkaters,1391059243.0,"Well in general a larger wheel will always maintain it's speed better than a smaller wheel, and roll longer distances before needing to push again.  The only downside to this is that with a larger wheel it's more difficult to control your speed which may be important if you like to do a lot of manual tricks, with smaller wheels it is a lot easier to manage how fast you are going, while with large wheels a few good pushes and you are off. 

I find 54mm a good in-the-middle size between small and big wheels, it gives me a good amount of speed control, acceleration, and I can maintain good speed.  

When it comes to wheel hardness, in an ideally perfect world, a hard wheel on a smooth surface will be the fastest rolling wheel.  The harder the wheel, the less friction there is, less grip means more speed on smooth surfaces.  

However, when you go onto rougher asphalt (streets that are extra bumpy, or rocky asphalt) where the ground is uneven, the more bumpy your ride the more you lose speed.  With softer wheels you can keep going over the rough terrain easier, they absorb the imperfections in the bumpier asphalt.  But softer wheels are slower on smooth terrain.  This is why a lot of cruisers have around 80a wheels, because you can keep cruising through shitty terrain without having to get off your board ever.  

If you are also street skating (posting here I am guessing you do a little street skating at least) then harder wheels are better also, since they slide.  If you land a trick where your board has to rotate (pop shuvit, 180, or landing from a boardslide or lipslide and turning your board straight coming off a ledge or rail), soft wheels will stick to the ground after you land, so if you land any rotational tricks and your board is slightly off from being straight, it has literally no give.  With a harder wheel you can quickly slide your board straight so you don't go flying off your board.  Being thrown off balance because your wheels stuck is no fun. "

Dr_Fix,LifeProTips,1391059295.0,"I am an IICRC certified carpet cleaning technician, and I caution you thus:  
When using rental machines, *don't over-do the soap*. I can't count how many times clients have told me ""it looked good for 2 days and now it looks worse than when I started.""

This is because rental machines (e.g. [Rug Doctor](http://www.rugdoctor.com) or [Bissel](http://www.bissellrental.com/)) don't have much in the way of extraction power. They can't quickly suck up what they put down. This deficiency in itself isn't bad, but it's compounded when people use too much soap, or don't rinse enough with just water. 

You can think of it like getting into the shower, lathering up your hair with shampoo, and then getting out without any rinsing. Once it dries, all that soap is going to be very tacky and attract dust and debris like crazy. Same thing can happen with carpets; you may verily clean off the dirt, but the residue you've left will just cause it to re-soil quickly.

TL;DR  
Easy on the soap, otherwise it'll just get dirty again real fast."

On a serious note, welcome to Cardinals NFC fandom.  They're an awesome team with a great fanbase and are based in one of my favorite cities in the world (Phoenix... I don't know anything about Glendale specifically).  Not sure if you have (or intend to have) any ties to the city.

I'm slowly getting into Arizona sports (as has been my goal for a while), and they're one of two teams I enjoy rooting for who are based in Phoenix.  If I didn't grow up as a third-generation fan of a different team, they'd probably be my #1 team by now.  I'm sure that by the time I move to the area, I'll be flying a Cardinals flag outside my home.  
(I can't speak for the Diamondbacks or the Suns because I don't enjoy the sports those teams play, and I haven't gotten as into the Coyotes, because I try to not watch too much hockey, for fear it will eat all of my time if I allow it to.  Football has the advantage of being only in very limited times)

Since it hasn't been said yet:  **get the [official app](http://www.azcardinals.com/mobile-app.html)** ... easier to follow a team if the information is always at your fingertips.

If you don't already have an AFL team and want to get into AZ sports and not just the Cardinals, may I encourage you to root for the Rattlers when that season starts in two months?  If you're in the Phoenix area, get some tickets too -- those games are fun and they don't cost a ton.  It also may help that there isn't a Buffalo team in that league, so there isn't a conflict of interest, as there might be in 2016 when the Bills play the Cardinals next.

I'd add something about not getting the Cardinals' hate of the Patriots, but you have that handled from the AFC side, so it doesn't matter.   Pats in their good era haven't negatively affected the Cardinals (defeating the division rival in the SB doesn't count as a good thing for the Cards, because the Rams weren't a rival to the Cardinals in 2001-02;  also, keeping the Steelers out of two SBs doesn't help because this was before SB43).  
But again, you ought to hate them on the AFC side anyway.

andjok,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391059697.0,"From the video description:

&gt;On December 9, 2013 an inmate was brought to the Rutherford County (TN) Sheriff's Office jail facility on a charge of ""Resisting"" and ""Hold - Other Department"". The inmate was placed into a restraint chair in the sally port, which binds your wrists and ankles into restraints, as well as various straps to limit movement.

&gt;Upon being brought into Holding Cell #133, a strap that goes across the inmate's legs to keep movement limited came loose. According to department records, this strap had been malfunctioning for several months prior.

&gt;Deputy James Vanderveer, who was re-hired after being forced to resign due to a DUI arrest, and is the nephew of Sheriff Robert Arnold, enters the holding cell and begins to re-secure the strap. The inmate's ankles and wrists are still securely in their restraints and he is unable to move his legs or arms more than an inch or two. There appears to be no struggle taking place when Deputy Vanderveer sprays pepper spray into the gap in his spit shield. The spit shield remains in place for ten minutes before being removed.
For one hour and fifteen minutes, the inmate receives no medical attention and can be seen convulsing, yelling for help, and struggling.

&gt;Deputy Vanderveer stated in a subsequent incident report that the inmate was combative and that his legs had come lose, which is contradictory to video evidence.
Jail supervisors later documented that they informed him that ""he better write a good report and ... hoped he could justify spraying someone while they were restrained in a restraint chair."" Deputy Vanderveer later received a written reprimand for ""Dispropotionate Use of Force"" and is still employed as a sheriff's deputy.

&gt;Sources: RCSO Incident #33690, RCSO Complaint #13120964007, RCSO Booking #329368, Report of Action from Cpt. Derrell Cagle Re: James Vanderveer on 12/12/13"

&gt;On December 9, 2013 an inmate was brought to the Rutherford County (TN) Sheriff's Office jail facility on a charge of ""Resisting"" and ""Hold - Other Department"". The inmate was placed into a restraint chair in the sally port, which binds your wrists and ankles into restraints, as well as various straps to limit movement.

&gt;Upon being brought into Holding Cell #133, a strap that goes across the inmate's legs to keep movement limited came loose. According to department records, this strap had been malfunctioning for several months prior.

&gt;Deputy James Vanderveer, who was re-hired after being forced to resign due to a DUI arrest, and is the nephew of Sheriff Robert Arnold, enters the holding cell and begins to re-secure the strap. The inmate's ankles and wrists are still securely in their restraints and he is unable to move his legs or arms more than an inch or two. There appears to be no struggle taking place when Deputy Vanderveer sprays pepper spray into the gap in his spit shield. The spit shield remains in place for ten minutes before being removed.
For one hour and fifteen minutes, the inmate receives no medical attention and can be seen convulsing, yelling for help, and struggling.

&gt;Deputy Vanderveer stated in a subsequent incident report that the inmate was combative and that his legs had come lose, which is contradictory to video evidence.
Jail supervisors later documented that they informed him that ""he better write a good report and ... hoped he could justify spraying someone while they were restrained in a restraint chair."" Deputy Vanderveer later received a written reprimand for ""Dispropotionate Use of Force"" and is still employed as a sheriff's deputy.

&gt;Sources: RCSO Incident #33690, RCSO Complaint #13120964007, RCSO Booking #329368, Report of Action from Cpt. Derrell Cagle Re: James Vanderveer on 12/12/13"

* Enjoyment of causing harm to others: ""Twilight, you've got to see this! Priceless!"" (Or when he laughs as Applejack falls, if the other one isn't enough for you.)

[](/cadance-i) I get the idea of Discord as a ""Pierre Le Fou"" style character, an omnipotent child, but that's simply not true.

If you don't agree with that, I invite you to rewatch everything between when Discord is first introduced to right before he creates the ""chaos capital of the world.""

After she said 
&gt;""I care about you, you're a really good friend""

I would've said, ""Don't ever talk to me like that again,"" looked into her eyes, then got up and walked out. Respect is number one for me, and if a girl calls me a ""really good friend"" when it's obvious I'm not her friend nor do I want to be, then she doesn't respect me.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391060063.0,"&gt; These are all distinct realms of study that cannot be mixed together. Suppose you tried to mix the study of ethics and the study of history. What would that even look like? ""I think it would be morally better if the holocaust never happened, therefore historically we can determine that it never happened!"" Obviously that's nonsense, and it's equally nonsense when you try to do that in economics. The job of a historian is to give the facts about what happened. Asking whether what happened was ""good"" or ""bad"" is an entirely different questions.

You can observe history via various ethical and moral lenses. You ancaps do this all the time in calling out the states throughout history for injustice. I just think morality should be involved in economics. The world would be a better place. 

&gt;If you stopped trying to skip to the end of the book and went through each chapter like you're supposed to, we might have been on the same page. If we weren't on the same page it was due to no fault of mine.

WraithPDX,gifs,1391060092.0,"GITS and Deus Ex have shown that there are plenty of downsides to it, I would imagine they would be represented similarly in reality. For Deus Ex:

* Neuropozine dependency (highly addictive drug required for augmented cyborgs)
* Discrimination/Stigmatization of cyborgs
* Threat of government regulation/banning of non-military cyborgs

For GITS, which is far more acceptable of cyborgs and widespread:

* Cyberbrain Sclerosis (hardening of brain tissue leading to brain death)
* Full cyberization can lead to being hacked and having your actions controlled by someone else.
* Various psychological disorders stemming from constant information access
* Regular maintenance required on the body and cybernetic organs
* You can't go swimming. Period.
* Human food impossible to eat, special cybernetic food required for internal cybernetic organs
* Very expensive. Even in GITS there aren't many full-cyborgs, though most everyone has a cyberbrain installed before they are teens (10 maybe? Can't remember Togusa's daughter's age.)

And if you don't want full cyberization, you run back into the problem with the initial picture."

Without spoiling too much (seeing as you're at ~12% for ME:3), here are a couple examples of run-ins with old squadmates, and these are only *small* parts of it (which have nothing to do with the hour-plus gameplay it offers): Meeting up with [Miranda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfR_Ztq2gfw), [Zaeed](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDmOJmdy1wg), and [Grunt](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjMuRJyLKIU) ""outside of work.""

Yeah, you get a new weapon; yeah, you get a few more War Assets, XP points, and achievements (if those are your thing); and no, the DLC is not required. But for me, it was like getting a call from my old room mate (haven't seen him in ~5 years) asking if I'm up for a couple drinks, while hanging out on his back porch and playing Age of Empires II like we did all those weeknights back in college. 

When played in the context of ""this is something BioWare made not because they had to, but because they realized what Mass Effect means to its fans,"" and that the story of Shepard ends with 3, it is a heartfelt Thank You note to the player. The programming, the writing, the acting, the music, and the integration of it all while maintaining the integrity of the story (serious, funny, happy, sad) are worth the price, *especially* for $15.

&gt;How would you describe yourself?


&gt;Why did you choose &lt;job field&gt;?

FlyingNeonPoop,AskWomen,1391060675.0,"This has happened to me twice in the past two years, and both guys were my closest friend at the time. On both occasions, I was dating someone else, and they confessed that they had fallen hard for me- that it was too painful to be my friend.

Both times, I bawled my eyes out and was so upset with myself. Personally, I don't believe that a guy and girl can be close friends without at least one person developing romantic feelings at least briefly during the friendship. Yet, even though I held this belief, I assumed that since I was in a relationship, I was in the clear, and my friends would just not fall for me. When it became obvious that I was no exception, I was so upset with myself for being so selfish.

I understood their reasoning, and though I was pretty damn sad, I respected their wishes and bid them farewell. I actually talk to them both now. They said they no longer have feelings for me, and I reluctantly believe them. Our friendships are NOTHING like how they were before, but we are friends again, so I'm okay with how things are.

I always have kept in mind that not every girl will find you attractive physically and emotionally they all have their own tastes. For me it all starts with how receptive she was with conversation. If that went well I would pay attention to if she touches you at all. Do a ring check, do you see a ring on her finger? Most women who have a boyfriend will somehow sneak in ""boyfriend"" into the sentence which is a way of implying ""I'm not single don't ask me out, but we can have a conversation"". I may do some facebook investigating to see if there is a boyfriend or Significant other. If everything checks out I would invite her somewhere with some friends, a group thing. While at the group thing I would continue to see how receptive she is to conversation. If she seems interested and you keep her attention I think it safe to say she is interested in you.

I personally don't think so, and see nothing wrong with giving the offenders the electric chair or handing them over to some horrifying fate. I understand the proposition that ""if we are to torture and execute people, then are we any better than the sadists we are punishing?"" The answer is yes. We would punish them to make an example of those who would destroy the lives of innocents.

Blozi,AskReddit,1391060839.0,"The fact that so many books still name the Beatles ""the greatest or most significant or most influential"" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success: the Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worth of being saved.
In a sense the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little attention to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as one can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for free for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply publicize what the music business wants to make money with.

Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. And rock critics will study more of rock history and realize who invented what and who simply exploited it commercially.

Beatles' ""aryan"" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll: it replaced syncopated african rhythm with linear western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles.

Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for a good reason. They could not figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to ""Beatlemania"", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). THat phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon &amp; McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Fours'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of ""Tommy"" and ""Quadrophenia"". Not to mention later and far greater British musicians. Not to mention the American musicians who created what the Beatles later sold to the masses.

The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented ""beatlemania"" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time to read a page about such a trivial band.

Note of 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternative opinion on their faith.

Jakub Krawczynski sent me this comment in 2010:

I find it quite amusing that almost all of the Beatles songs have their own entries on wikipedia (nothing wrong with that in itself, actually), even if they are not singles, and each of them is meticulously dissected as if there were transcendental suites exceeding human comprehension, yet bands like Faust or Red Krayola, etc. have biographies even shorter than just one article about any random Beatles song. Needless to say, none of their songs have any articles on them, yet I'm sure there would be a lot more to talk about. Moreover, if you had put any bad review of their album on the site with the intention to show the broader scope of opinions, you'd risk your ""life"" there, since such fanatics don't accept any single sign of trying to be objective. You are seen as public enemy number 1 to them. It's like your article is one giant cognitive dissonance to them and vandalizing your bio was the only way to reduce this dissonance.

The Beatles most certainly belong to the history of the 60s, but their musical merits are at best dubious.

The Beatles came to be at the height of the reaction against rock and roll, when the innocuous ""teen idols"", rigorously white, were replacing the wild black rockers who had shocked the radio stations and the conscience of half of America. Their arrival represented a lifesaver for a white middle class terrorized by the idea that within rock and roll lay a true revolution of customs. The Beatles tranquilized that vast section of people and conquered the hearts of all those (first and foremost the females) who wanted to rebel without violating the societal status quo. The contorted and lascivious faces of the black rock and rollers were substituted by the innocent smiles of the Beatles; the unleashed rhythms of the first were substituted by the catchy tunes of the latter. Rock and roll could finally be included in the pop charts. The Beatles represented the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making, and for a few years they managed to run its enthusiasm into the ground.

Furthermore, the Beatles represented the reaction against a social and political revolution. They arrived at the time of the student protests, of Bob Dylan, of the Hippies, and they replaced the image of angry kids with their fists in the air, with their cordial faces and their amiable declarations. They came to replace the accusatory words of militant musicians with overindulgent nursery rhymes. In this fashion as well the Beatles served as middle-class tranquilizers, as if to prove the new generation was not made up exclusively of rebels, misfits and sexual maniacs.

For most of their career the Beatles were four mediocre musicians who sang melodic three-minute tunes at a time when rock music was trying to push itself beyond that format (a format originally confined by the technical limitations of 78 rpm record). They were the quintessence of ""mainstream"", assimilating the innovations proposed by rock music, within the format of the melodic song.

The Beatles belonged, like the Beach Boys (whom they emulated for most of their career), to the era of the vocal band. In such a band the technique of the instrument was not as important as the chorus. Undoubtedly skilled at composing choruses, they availed themselves of producer George Martin (head of the Parlophone since 1956), to embellish those choruses with arrangements more and more eccentric.

Thanks to a careful publicity campaign they became the most celebrated entertainers of the era, and are still the darlings of magazines and tabloids, much like Princess Grace of Monaco and Lady Di.

The convergence between Western polyphony (melody, several parts of vocal harmony and instrumental arrangements) and African percussion - the leitmotif of American music from its inception - was legitimized in Europe by the huge success of the Merseybeat, in particular by its best sellers, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Beatles, both produced by George Martin and managed by Brian Epstein. To the bands of the Merseybeat goes the credit of having validated rock music for a vast audience, a virtually endless audience. They were able to interpret the spirit and the technique of rock and roll, while separating it from its social circumstances, thus defusing potential explosions. In such fashion, they rendered it accessible not only to the young rebels, but to all. Mediocre musicians and even more mediocre intellectuals, bands like the Beatles had the intuition of the circus performer who knows how to amuse the peasants after a hard day's work, an intuition applied to the era of mass distribution of consumer goods.

Every one of their songs and every one of their albums followed much more striking songs and albums by others, but instead of simply imitating those songs, the Beatles adapted them to a bourgeois, conformist and orthodox dimension. The same process was applied to the philosophy of the time, from the protest on college campuses to Dylan's pacifism, from drugs to the Orient. Their vehicle was melody, a universal code of sorts, that declared their music innocuous. Naturally others performed the same operation, and many (from the Kinks to the Hollies, from the Beach Boys to the Mamas and Papas) produced melodies even more memorable, yet the Beatles arrived at the right moment and theirs would remain the trademark of the melodic song of the second half of the twentieth century."

Another thing that can help is typing out what is bothering you so that you identify, focus on, and make sense of your feelings and emotions. This has helped me a lot. It helps you gain control and confront them rather than bury them. It's difficult to be happy when you trivialize your feelings and problems and view your emotions as an enemy you must subdue. How can you take care of yourself and be happy if you don't value yourself as an individual? Part of that is not diminishing yourself and your emotions.

I have struggled with this and am working on it and I feel much better already. My problems and emotions always felt so trivial and it felt self indulgent and silly to does time thinking about or acknowledging them. Yet would I treat other people's emotions this way? No. That's why I treated others better than I treated myself. But you and I are both human beings deserving of the dignity of experiencing emotions instead of burying them by dismissing them as silly. 

Meditation can be a great way to come to calmness, clarity, and understanding an learning to be aware of yourself. It is empowering to be aware and acknowledge what is going on inside of you and it is the way to overcome those issues. Burying and dismissing them hasn't helped, so why not try?

 Bur for me they are more comfortable because you don't need to insert them nearly as high as a cup or tampon. I can literally 'plug' my vagina and still have half the sponge poking out if that's all I can bear to do. Unlike a cup, where you must put it all the way in. I find most of my pain comes from deeper internal penetration.

I struggle to get a cup inside, I have to arouse myself first and by the time It takes me to get it in or take it out without crying, I may as well of used a sponge and just emptied it twice. The sponge also seems to 'give' to my body as I walk or sit. a good brand of cup would do the same but I was only able to get a Lunete, the plastic of which is quite firm. I can always feel it inside. But after a while I do tend to forget about the sponge. 

If a cup is working, I'd say stick with the cup, the risk of TSS is lower, the risk of infection is lower, and they are easier to clean. They hold more and they leak less. 

It all depends on how much pain the cup is causing you, If you are seriously looking for an alternative and are willing to put up with more frequent changing and a more intricate cleaning routine, I do recommend the sponge over the cup when it comes to comfort."

The contorted and lascivious faces of the black rock and rollers were substituted by the innocent smiles of the Beatles; the unleashed rhythms of the first were substituted by the catchy tunes of the latter. Rock and roll could finally be included in the pop charts. The Beatles represented the quintessential reaction to a musical revolution in the making, and for a few years they managed to run its enthusiasm into the ground.

Furthermore, the Beatles represented the reaction against a social and political revolution. They arrived at the time of the student protests, of Bob Dylan, of the Hippies, and they replaced the image of angry kids with their fists in the air, with their cordial faces and their amiable declarations. They came to replace the accusatory words of militant musicians with overindulgent nursery rhymes. In this fashion as well the Beatles served as middle-class tranquilizers, as if to prove the new generation was not made up exclusively of rebels, misfits and sexual maniacs.

For most of their career the Beatles were four mediocre musicians who sang melodic three-minute tunes at a time when rock music was trying to push itself beyond that format (a format originally confined by the technical limitations of 78 rpm record). They were the quintessence of ""mainstream"", assimilating the innovations proposed by rock music, within the format of the melodic song.

The Beatles belonged, like the Beach Boys (whom they emulated for most of their career), to the era of the vocal band. In such a band the technique of the instrument was not as important as the chorus. Undoubtedly skilled at composing choruses, they availed themselves of producer George Martin (head of the Parlophone since 1956), to embellish those choruses with arrangements more and more eccentric.

Thanks to a careful publicity campaign they became the most celebrated entertainers of the era, and are still the darlings of magazines and tabloids, much like Princess Grace of Monaco and Lady Di.

The convergence between Western polyphony (melody, several parts of vocal harmony and instrumental arrangements) and African percussion - the leitmotif of American music from its inception - was legitimized in Europe by the huge success of the Merseybeat, in particular by its best sellers, Gerry and the Pacemakers and the Beatles, both produced by George Martin and managed by Brian Epstein. To the bands of the Merseybeat goes the credit of having validated rock music for a vast audience, a virtually endless audience. They were able to interpret the spirit and the technique of rock and roll, while separating it from its social circumstances, thus defusing potential explosions. In such fashion, they rendered it accessible not only to the young rebels, but to all. Mediocre musicians and even more mediocre intellectuals, bands like the Beatles had the intuition of the circus performer who knows how to amuse the peasants after a hard day's work, an intuition applied to the era of mass distribution of consumer goods.

Every one of their songs and every one of their albums followed much more striking songs and albums by others, but instead of simply imitating those songs, the Beatles adapted them to a bourgeois, conformist and orthodox dimension. The same process was applied to the philosophy of the time, from the protest on college campuses to Dylan's pacifism, from drugs to the Orient. Their vehicle was melody, a universal code of sorts, that declared their music innocuous. Naturally others performed the same operation, and many (from the Kinks to the Hollies, from the Beach Boys to the Mamas and Papas) produced melodies even more memorable, yet the Beatles arrived at the right moment and theirs would remain the trademark of the melodic song of the second half of the twentieth century."

Oddly enough I am going to agree with /u/ReturntotheHogLagoon 

Your primary profile photo should look how you expect to look when you walk into the cafe/coffee shop/restaurant where you first meet the lovely lady you connect with through this profile.

No sunglasses covering your eyes, no hoody hiding your face, no dive mask an re-breather.   All those are fine in secondary pictures and secondary albums, but not your primary profile picture.

**self-summary**

Meh.. lack luster, does not share enough of who you are.. most of what you've put here belongs in what you are doing with your life not a summary of who you are.  Gather the bits from other parts of your profile

You're a gamer, you're a trumpet player, you're an optimist, you're a SCUBA driver, you're passionate about learning and about teaching.. you like travel, and your passion/love of the study of biology is tied to and informs many of these things..   Get that in here!

**What you're doing with your life**

Immediate.. you already said you're a recent graduate.. are you continuing on to grad school?  Are you taking time off to do some work in your field before continuing.. what?!?

Distant.. what do you want to do with your degree?  Is it going to be marine biology, which may limit where you live geographically to be able to be a marine biologist?

**What you're good at**

Move trumpet playing up first.. it's not as sexy as a saxophone player but musical ability is good and it's still jazz.

The rest is still pretty good and still belongs here but I think trumpet playing sells the section.   don't let your lip get out of practice, find a group to play with for fun.

**first things**

You're 6'3"" maybe rocking facial hair, maybe baby faced, that's gonna get noticed before anyone realizes you're an enthusiastic optimist.. the current contents here belong up in your self summary and you need to ask your newest friends what the first thing is they noticed when they first saw you.

**Favorites**

One item each for three categories?!  Really?!   And for music that one thing is the TRON Legacy soundtrack?  Dude.. rethink and try again.

**Six**

Solid.. superior to many sixes I have read.

**Thinking about**

Finally here we read about potential graduate studies.. As I said, get that up there in what you're doing with your life.

And you write collaborative stories?!??  WtF NOW you mention this?!?  Get that up in the self summary too!

All this is pretty good here, but this is not the *first* time we should be learning about any of this.. 

**Friday Night**

Emphasis on NIGHT.. you're kicking back in a robe and slippers drinking coffee as you read science articles?   

Are you even *looking* for a potential date/mate?!?  You should have at least one thing here that a potential date can see doing *with* you.  I don't care if it's a movie, live music (Watching you play with a Jazz group??) something to let a lady insert you into her imaginary date.

**private thing**
Okay.. transformers or are you a bronie?  (I can't comment much, there are three stuffed critters from Insomniacs Outernauts game on my desk at the moment)

Good private thing for generating questions/conversation.

**message me if**

True of most others, but he costs more than most others.  

And if you're winning, any of the giants could be cheaper and just as effective, as well as stuff like ironbark protector, war golem, whatever.

You're not. Its vanity. Its a paintjob. It's a ribbon in your hair. Given that scammers are PM'ing and bypassing the falir system anyway, in my mind a functional flair would include everyone having the same flair that reads ""CHECK SPELLING AND HISTORY AND YOU ARE STILL TAKING YOUR CHANCES"". Looking at a verification thread may not even be the best way to establish credibility as users could easily add a few zeros to the end of their transaction history because there is no push to have confirmers retype the amount traded.

They are great connectors.  The metal exterior is keyed and the wires are recessed so you can't really push it in incorrectly which could damage the pins.  Second, some models have a push/pull exterior which activates little grips to hold it in place.  

For anybody that is curious, here are a few pictures of them.   The cost for them is pretty high.  I paid about 40 dollars for one connector, which was similiar size to the second or third smallest in the picture below.

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1391061344.0,"I went to a school that had about 50% membership in Greek life but I was not personally in a sorority. I think fraternities and sororities get a worse rap than they deserve, though. Like yeah, there are some people who fit the negative stereotypes, but there were a lot more who didn't. And there was a lot of variation from one sorority to another (same with frats). So I wouldn't lump them all together.

I didn't want to join one because they cost a lot of money, none of my close girl friends were rushing at that time, and I didn't want to get pinned into the stereotype of any one sorority.

But I can also see the appeal. I mean for some people it's just a social status thing. For some people the idea of a sisterhood and getting to fit in and be part of something seems cool. It definitely helps you meet more girls from other class years. With joint events you also have a lot of opportunities to meet people in fraternities and other sororities. Then there are usually some fun parties and especially some fun theme parties, which I would have totally been into. At some schools there is cool housing in the sorority/ frat houses. There can also be a legacy thing, like some people join the same sorority that their mom was in. There are lots of charity events and opportunities to volunteer.

A man hugs a guitar on stage and croons a soft song in the background. Nobody pays attention to him, and his tip jar is still empty.

A younger man sits next to the old drunk I was just observing. He heaves a heavy sigh, and looks to me, beckoning me over.

“Scotch, neat.” He doesn’t say please. Looking at his face, I can tell why. He’s exhausted, circles under his eyes. His hands, resting on the bar, are cracked and worn. His fingernails are permanently stained with either dirt or oil – I don’t look closely enough to determine.

I pour the man a little longer than I normally would. He looks like he needs it. I set the glass in front of him wordlessly. He takes it into his hands carefully. I watch him stare down into the glass, turning it around in his hands. He doesn’t lift it to his lips. He looks back up at me, and I’m caught staring.

lynn,breakingmom,1391061400.0,"I did this too. Problem is, WTF is gradual? And what about when ""gradual"" doesn't work? I started off waiting forever, because I'd be messing around on reddit or facebook, but when I tried to put her down a little earlier after nursing her to sleep, there'd be a point that I just couldn't get past without her waking up, and frankly I just wasn't willing to risk it. It was so frustrating when she'd wake up fully because I put her down before she was fully asleep.

A lot of people say ""you'll never ever sleep through the night"" if you don't sleep train in one way or another. Bullshit. Like I said, friends of ours did CIO (when their baby was 4 months old, btw) and though she did go to sleep on her own -- still does -- she gets up in the middle of the night all the time. But until my son was born, I slept through the night for at least six months, except for the occasional nightmare, and even then I'd comfort her for a while and then go back to bed -- she never left her room.

Here's what we did: I weaned her at about 21-22 months (for unrelated reasons: her latch was crap and she wouldn't fix it, so I stopped offering and she never asked. She never had been terribly interested in food). For a few months, I had a Thursday evening knitting circle so she got used to Daddy putting her to bed one night a week (he had done so before, but now it became regular). Then we added another night or two for a month or so. Last January (she was about 2 and 4 months), my husband started putting her to bed every night, because we were trying for our second and his brother and his wife strongly suggested weaning her off me doing it.

He did what I was unable to do (because I'd get distracted on reddit on my phone): he left earlier and earlier in the process of lying there waiting for her to fall asleep. It took a few weeks, but about a month after he started putting her to bed every night, one night he read her her story like usual, turned off the light, snuggled her and said good night, and left the room.

For about a week or two, she'd come out afterward. We had some difficulties because we weren't consistent and we gave her too much attention (and too much of it came from me), but once we settled into immediately putting her back to bed, kiss, night-night, close door...it didn't take but a few days until she stopped coming out of her room.

She still woke up once or twice a night. At first I let her come to bed with us. Then I forced myself to wake up enough to go lie down next to her bed in her room (her crib mattress was on the floor in her own room since we moved around her 2nd birthday). Protip: when you switch them out of the crib, give them a full-size mattress so you can lie down next to them, even if it's a twin. I wished I had; the floor was uncomfortable. So I'd wrap myself in a blanket and fall asleep next to her, wake up an hour or two later and go back to bed.

After a while of that, I started sitting with her for a little bit, then saying I was going to go back to bed, night night, snuggle-kiss. Finally I explained that it was time for her to stay in her room at night. For a while, she'd call for me a few times within an hour or two. I stopped that by only snuggling her the first time. After that, I'd cover her with the blanket, give her a quick kiss, say something about how it's time for sleep now, and go back to bed.

Then she started waking up before dawn, and I had to put her back to bed with the explanation that it wasn't light out so it wasn't time to get up yet.

She's now 3 years and 4 months, and she stays in her room all night.

Like I said in my first comment when I had to go to bed so I couldn't elaborate: sometimes the cure is worse than the disease. If that's the case, stick with the disease. She's not even 6 months old yet, they change so much in the first couple of years that you never know what kind of a sleeper she's going to be in a year or two. And it's not like she's going to be climbing into your bed when she's in high school.

Personally I'd much rather have a couple of weeks of putting the kid back in her room over and over and over again every night, when she's 2 or 3, than fighting with a baby -- who, btw, is biologically wired to need physical closeness to their caregiver(s) -- for months or a year or more."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1391061498.0,"At first, I thought it was just me being picky/jealous. We used to hang out a LOT, so much that her parents had a running joke that they had adopted me.  So I held my tongue about anything.  Later, I found out that it wasn't just me; all her other pre-sorority friends felt ""left behind"" by her.  This includes not just childhood friends like myself, but old high school friends of hers and even non-Greek life college friends of hers.  Our complaints were all the same; that she seemed to ignore us if we contacted her, or she would flake out of everything we try to set up to see her.  She had a lot of excuses too, saying it's schoolwork or she had no money to go out.  

But....this is the 21st century.  We're all on Facebook!  So we would see tons of pictures and Places/Foursquare tags with her and her sorority sisters going to bars, clubs, etc; we see her out socializing and spending money, so those excuses were just excuses.  It's hard not to feel unwanted when someone you thought was your good friend suddenly doesn't wanna make time for you, but does make time for these other, newer people.  I clicked ""Ignore posts"" on her for a year or so, because the Foursquare stuff was getting so spammy with how frequent she would check in at places.  Even during vacations, when she would be back home and not in college, she would take the train for 2 hours to go back to campus and be with them.  So we didn't see her much between semesters either.

During pledging, she also developed some mild anorexia and food issues.  They had some kind of rule that you could be NO BIGGER than a size 2.  Although she wasn't fit and did have a bit of pudge, she was still only a size 4 and looked pretty hot, in my opinion.  And it's freaking hard to lose weight when you're already not that big...

Overall, most of her old friends tried to stick around, but by senior year of college, she had lost a lot of her non-sorority friends.  After a certain number of losses, and after she entered her 5th year of college, she started coming back a bit.  Not sure if there was some kind of incident that changed her mind.  Maybe she just got hit with some nostalgia and wanted to talk to us again.  Maybe it was because her core friends graduated during 4th year.  But anyway, she did attempt reconnections with us.  I felt some of hers were half-hearted, possibly done just because her parents keep asking why she doesn't hang out with me anymore.  She'd text my phone saying to come hang out because she's in my neighborhood....*except it's daytime and I'm out at work!*  Then I'll hear her tell people or her parents (who are friends with my mom still) that she say I'm always busy.  Busy with trying to pay my bills?? :(  Also if I sound bitter...this is completely unrelated to sororities but she did blame me for getting raped towards the end of college, and never apologized for it.  In fact, the first time she talked to me after telling me it's my fault, she asked me to come wait in her car for 2hrs while she goes to an interview, so she doesn't get ticketed.  Hung up on her...

But we did indeed reconnect, eventually.  We are no where near how close we used to be.  We see each other in person maybe twice a year, because I need to know if I'm gonna see you a day in advance, and she wants to just text people to come out on a whim, still.  I used to feel bad about not making time for her small windows, but then I remembered...I have a life too.  No reason for me to put more effort in to this than she is.  Also, she's entered nursing school and THANKFULLY learning about proper nutrition has helped her out a lot!!  Doesn't seem to have much food issues anymore."

The fact that Flash is so outrageously fast and can ignore the negative aspects of moving so fast means that he's a high level fighter, not that we should twist our reasoning to put him on the level of whoever we want him to fight. If a character can only compete if we compare his highest showings with his opponent's lowest, then he deserves to lose.

&gt;Except he's obviously stopped on a regular, because he doesn't use them as efficient as possible all the time. 

You are right that he doesn't go at 100% all of the time. And personality does come into play, which is why you'll often see people say ""Flash could beat up *x character* if he was bloodlusted."" The implication is that were he not, he couldn't do it.

Still, non-bloodlusted Flash is really hard to beat. If you can't even touch him at his base fighting level (and Spider-Man just isn't fast enough), then you probably can't compete."

What came was a gorgeous set, art-deco lamps, olive green furniture, dark mahogany tables, and a light tan rug - it was obvious my grandfather (my mother's actual father) helped with the purchase. However, me being the mischievous gentleman I am took my acting abilities to the test. 

I called my mother sounding distraught and she immediately got worried. ""Mom... the couches are corduroy and a purplish grey color and the lamps... OH GOD, Mom! They're *ORANGE*!"" 

My mother ended up leaving work as soon as she was able to rush home and see what the step-monster sent. Honestly, what I described to my mother was something the woman would do.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391061549.0,"&gt; By all means, show us this better way then. The economic law of marginal utility states that ""the greater the supply of a good, the lower the marginal utility; the smaller the supply, the higher the marginal utility"". How would you integrate ethics into this economic law?

How about paying your employees a little more when you make a massive profit? Not becausde you have to, but because you can? What about not exploiting people?

Or, if this is too much for you, why not have a government with the power to rule on ethical issues to set these rules and apply them by force, if economics itself is too amoral? Thats the problem with libertarianism in general for me. Its totally unwilling to do what needs to be done in order to make the world a little more just a little more moral. It justifies some having excess, while others starve.

Manhattan himself said that nothing ever ends, so I get the feeling that the peace will only last so long.  Even if the truth never gets out people will still be people.

sleepyj910,DebateAnAtheist,1391061572.0,"&gt;According to atheism

Atheism merely states that the God Hypothesis is not convincing.

&gt;But what stops you from killing someone or something in the name of progress of society or science?

Nothing seems to stop our soldiers.  But it's not murder because a large group of people support their actions.  The community allows the sin in the right context.  Rape is currently disfavored, but in many dark age societies it was considered a spoil of victory.  Usually when the victims were not seen as members of the community, thus were not granted protection.

Morality is governed by community because we are a communal species.  Moral behavior that supports community has become encoded into our DNA, and the patterns grow in our brain like fingerprints upon our fingers.  Empathy isn't given by God, it's given by evolution.

The most important point to consider is that if I murder someone, then  how can it be objectively wrong?  If everyone were murderers, then we wouldn't consider murder to be objectively wrong right?  But most people are not.  But that's not because they are ignoring some Divine imperative that others are following.  

Do you have the urge the murder but stop because of God, and if so, why are some people immune to God's law.  

No, morality only makes sense if we consider people's action as always self-serving, and the reason we don't murder all the time is because murder is rarely good for our long term survival, and a society built on murder does not advance very far.  We don't murder because we all agree that murderers are a nuisance because we need people.  A murderer is a stupid thing to be if you want to be happy in the long term, and there a various reasons for this, and all these reasons are what make morality subjective.

I'm against lying because we don't like to be lied to and noone will help me if I'm revealed to be one.  But I would like to save Anne Frank.

I'm against cheating for similar reasons, yet unhappy people cheat all the time as they seek something better for themselves, and they make a judgement call, usually a bad one.  But it's a very human thing, and most of them aren't thinking clearly about the consequences.

Consequences is key, because it's consequences that matter.  The more we understand the consequences of things, the more moral we can be, because we will not make poor choices.

Objective morality, which isn't really objective because our values change all the time, is an immoral concept in itself because it prevents us from understanding consequences, and adapting to new realities in a chaotic world.  A society that does not adapt will fail, and societies that change the rules to fit their realities succeed.

After all, slavery, fuedalism, oppression of women, these concepts are ending because people rejected the old ways, and if morality was objective, there would never be the need for change, because we'd all simply understand how to be.  

Again, how can something be objective, if we can't agree on what it is."

The guys are looking at the man to emulate. They are not looking at the princess to make guesses about what she desires in a man. Looking at actions instead of interpreting feelings. 

In the Disney movies you listed where the male showed any presence at all, they tended to be highly selfless. Iirc, The Beast almost died. Sleeping Beauty's prince fought an evil faerie dragon, risking his life.

There have been a lot of topics on this in trp and even one right now where the poster talks about the weak male characters in American Pie. Each time, all trp eyes are on the *man*, not wondering wtf the girl is thinking.

There are lots of examples that I can't type on my iPhone, so I'll cut it short and say that it really just comes down to Western media romanticizing the underdog. I don't think it's targeted, feminist propaganda against men, but just an overall preference to see the weaker guy overcoming the odds due to his righteousness and ""nice"" personality. 

Now this isn't true everywhere. Not as much in Non Western countries. One reason may be because of Cold War clash of ideologies between western individualist personal triumph vs second world collectivism. Communist propaganda much more frequently show nice individuals get their shit kicked in, because nice guys shouldnt survive without the state.

Outside countries with state controlled media, people especially parents don't want to see a manipulative, mean, or privileged person win (it might even influence their kids to become trpers, gasp), so the media plays into that. We get a whole bunch of weaker nice guy protagonists.

Also, for romantic story or subplot to actually be interesting, it has to last longer than an opening sequence where the guy protagonist immediately asks the girl out. There has to be a story. So the guy is made awkward and shy on top of already being an underdog. 

Not necessarily a grand feminist lie but a set of narrative biases caused by lazy storytelling, unoriginal thought, and Western ideological circle jerking which jerked extra hard during and after the Cold War.

On a tangential note, 

If you want an interesting comparison of male and female protagonists collectively you could look at Japanese media. It's quite interesting because they explicitly categorize stories by age and gender: shounen, shoujo, seinen, josei. These are age and gender categorizations based on whom the target audience is. This rather rigid system makes it easy to distinguish preferences of Japanese boys and girls, at least.

I haven't watched much anime in a long time so this might be out of date, but look at Tenchi Muyo for a shounen example and Sailor Moon for a shoujo example. Tenchi is an honest nice guy and has a harem. In contrast, the male love interest of Usagi/Serena/Sailor Moon is mean, distant and mysterious. It's a common set of themes in those categories."

csreid,WTF,1391061751.0,"First, get like 10,000 random reddit comments. Make sure some have puns and some don't. Tag the ones that have puns. 

Then, train a battery of machine learning models on that data set (decision trees, naive bayes, svm, for example). Keep a test set, and once the models are trained, test them. Make a note of the number of false positive/negatives and true positive/negatives. 

Then, use some heuristics to parse the comments into their constituent phonemes. Store this separately from the original data set. 

Then, use the original data set to generate n-grams of various length (up to, say, 5 words). Store them and their associated probability. 

Then write another program to run through the comments and look for very low probability n-grams. Check these low probability n-grams for phonetically similar (using the phoneneme data) replacements that have a substantially higher probability. This is a potential pun. 

Test this pun-finder algorithm similarly to how you tested the other models. 

Finally, write a Chrome plug in to run through each reddit comment thread you open and apply each of these models. Use the performance numbers from your tests to apply Bayes' formula for conditional probability to calculate the probability that each comment contains a pun, and have the Chrome plug in ignore anything with a probability over 0.5 (you can tune this number if you like).

arcticfox00,asktransgender,1391061755.0,"Just one thing before we start: transsexual people don't change our gender. That's the one thing (gender) that's fixed and isn't ever going to change (it's different for other transgender people, but I'll explain that later). We *can't* change our gender, or choose it. We have to change our bodies because the dissonance created by having one not match the other is extraordinarily overwhelming. [[41% suicide attempt rate overwhelming.]](http://transequality.org/PDFs/NTDSReportonHealth_final.pdf)

It's kind of like how you know you're female. You likely just *know* it. Or never questioned it. But if someone called you out on it, if someone asked ""Why are *you* in the women's restroom/changing room/whatever?"", I'm sure you'd be offended and think it was obvious that you belonged - you're a woman, duh. Who are *they* to tell you otherwise? 

And if you say it's because of your genitals, then it can be the same for us in that sense as well (some of us have genital dysphoria - which is essentially an utter disgust for our parts, the antonym of euphoria). Some kids know when they're young. More than a few (but definitely not all) little trans girls think their penis is going to fall off, or try to cut it off, or wonder when they're going to grow breasts. Trans boys wonder why they don't have a penis, or even feel a phantom penis. As things get older, we start to realise that some things aren't going to change, and some are (puberty), and that can be a really distressful time.

I mean, puberty kind of sucks for everyone, but it's multiplied for many trans people; watching your body morph into something unrecognisable, something you hate.

The ""process for changing"" greatly varies. When you hear 'transgender', you most likely think 'transsexual', someone who wants to go 'all the way', so to speak. We're greatly over-represented in the media, but there are other kinds of trans people. It's about your sex assigned at birth not matching up with your internal sense of gender, whatever that gender may be. And along with that, there are many things people do to get their body aligned with that internal sense of gender. 

Some people just take hormones (which work like they do for cis people - it's like a second puberty in the opposite direction). After puberty, though, hormones can't affect bone (so no shrinking height/hands/feet for trans women or growing for men). Men will have their voice drop at any age, but once a woman's has dropped, it will never get higher (without a fuck-ton of practise and surgery). Men will develop male-pattern baldness and get hairier, and women will avoid it and their body hair (but not facial hair) will generally thin out, and depending on what they take, women can regrow head-hair they've lost. Women will grow breasts - the size varies widely, and no, they're not always smaller than cis women's breasts. Men's won't shrink, but their menstruation will cease after some time (a few months, I believe). There are also plenty of subtle mental effects I can't even begin to detail at the moment. I wish we could do an experiment where cis people take cross-sex hormones for several months, but that would be inhumane. It would be a nightmare for those people. It's funny how the same 'inhumane' view doesn't apply to trans people, though, even though our bodies are naturally producing the same effect (the 'wrong' hormones).

Now, other people just wear different clothes and experiment with the way they express themselves without hormones or surgery. They may choose neuter pronouns (like 'they', or 'ze' or 'hir'). It's respectful to respect that decision, regardless of what you think they 'really' are (assigned male at birth? female? - that line of thinking is irrelevant and offensive - don't do it with other trans people, either). They may consider themselves androgynous, genderqueer, bigender, or whatever. It doesn't make their identity less real just because it's less common or represented.

Of course, most cis people have that tunnel vision for 'the surgery', 'the sex change' (please don't ever use that term - go for genital reconstruction or just gender confirmation surgery). That's all it boils down to; that's what makes us special curiosities to cis people - the 'transformation'. It's all they can focus on. It's the first thing they ask about, often-times with no malicious intent, but often with a tone like they *deserve* a response. Like it's only natural that we should have to explain ourselves, being the curiosities: ""How does the surgery work?"" ""How *real* are they (your junk)?"" ""Do they work like/look like a real man/woman's?"" ""How do you have sex?"" ""Do you plan to get the surgery?"" ""Have you had it?"" But it's really rude. It's exceptionally rude. It's none of your business. (Impersonal questions about things in general are okay, though, as long as they're asked with tact and not directed at an individual who hasn't expressed a willingness to answer things like that. I don't mind discussing exactly how bottom surgery for trans women works, for instance. Other people might.) 

That said, some various surgical options are breast augmentation, orchiectomy (removal of testes), mastectomy (removal of breasts), vocal surgery (to raise pitch and alter resonance - testosterone does this naturally, though), and phalloplasty and vaginoplasty (and labiaplasty, etc, usually the feminine surgeries are combined into one - sometimes it's two separate surgeries, though). There's facial feminisation surgery for trans women - [[this site]](http://www.virtualffs.co.uk/In_a_Nutshell.html) does a good job discussing in detail which facial features are commonly deemed masculine or feminine. I have to admit, from a medical standpoint a lot of these surgeries are rather interesting - particularly the way phalloplasty/metoidioplasty can actually *lengthen a urethra*. It's when you put us in a cage, in the zoo, and focus on how odd we are, or do something similar and put us on a pedestal to marvel at our amazing butterfly transformation; anything to separate us from cis people and make our bodies, our *identities*, seem constructed and artificial. That's a really important point to understand; it might be hard to grasp at first, but I hope I've explained it well enough.

I guess that's it for now. It's a lot to get through, I realise, but if you are honestly interested in becoming a better, more understanding person, I hope you'll read it and try to take in some of it, at least. Especially that last point. You've already made a good step by asking for more information."

Hatewrecked,AskReddit,1391062127.0,"Well we don't live in total democracy of course, but the reason why the system is broken is because voters are entirely uninformed about their political leaders. I'll bet you all the money in the world that 95% of the people in this country can't name half of their state's representatives and senators.

Shacod,AskReddit,1391062132.0,"You can organize the system like that but it won't give you the answer you want. His head is effectively just a ball tethered to his body, so when it undergoes a change in momentum the lions share of momentum will be transferred to his head. You could argue that very small parts of the momentum are transferred to the car by way of his body on the seat attached to his head, but that's not what we're looking for. 

To find the information we want, the car does nothing besides provide the velocity of Kennedy's head. A proper explanation of the situation requires some more complex ideas.

If you assume that we have dimensions x,y, and z you can think of it more clearly. For a more simple explanation, we can look at it from a top-down perspective. 

We will assume the direction that the motorcade was driving was positive in a direction more or less parallel to the Y-axis. The position of Lee Harvey Oswald makes the shot at an angle roughly 35 degrees^* from the Y-axis. This means the shot will have both an X and Y component to it's momentum, as opposed to Kennedy's momentum only having a Y component. The Y component of the bullets moment is also in the positive Y direction, and the X component will be positive as well. 

The system, in this case, is the bullet and Kennedy's head. The total momentum of the system is about 34.35 kgm/s, so the final momentum will also be 34.35kgm/s until it's acted upon by an outside impulse. The bullet went through Kennedy's head, and if I recall correctly the bullet was found further down the road, so this indicates that the bullet didn't actually get to transfer all of it's momentum to Kennedy's head, as it still had velocity after it exited his head, which means it still had momentum. The momentum that was transferred to his head was all in the positive Y and positive X directions, however, which means that his head would move forward and to his left, much like the direction of the bullet. Conservation of momentum does not prove that the headshot was from Oswald, it indicates otherwise as his head went backwards and to his left. 

It's not a simple conservation of momentum problem though. There are many other factors too complicated for me to explain. Life isn't high school physics.

Get some lavendar lotion to use on your body and put a little in/under your nostrils before the ceremony. The night before or the morning of take a bath with candles and aroma therapy. If there is one thing you decide to do, it must be this: [natural bio-destressing](http://hblu.org/bio-destressing.html) / [tapping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gmz-b2sV0Q). It helps to focus each of your senses on the present moment so you aren't thinking of worries or feeling anxiety symptoms and IT WORKS. Even if it looks silly just try it and you will see. Practice mindfulness throughout the day--focus on the smell of the flowers, notice the wrinkles in your husband's eyes when he smiles, feel the fabric of your dress, concentrate on all the flavors of your food, close your eyes during your first dance and just focus on the emotion. Making an effort to really experience all of your senses will ensure you will be entirely there for each moment. And finally, make an agreement with yourself that if anything goes wrong at this point, all you can do is laugh and move on...at the end of the day you'll be married no matter what. "

MightySasquatch,minnesotavikings,1391062377.0,"Yea these are all good and valid points. 

I did some searching and found several studies indicating stadiums reduced  or kept the same real income per capita in areas (it looked at basketball and football stadiums) over the 10 years after they are built. Obviously this doesn't isolate other variables but looks at multiple stadiums and how much real income was in the city before, during, and after construction. I couldn't really find anything about revenue which is what we are discussing. I seem to remember a study specific to the superbowl but I think it was primarily discussing the olympics (which are a lot more expensive to host), and can't seem to find it anyway.

I think the combination of what you stated helps with revenue a decent amount, not nearly enough to pay for the whole stadium but probably a small percentage of it, like $150-200 million of the ~$900 million it will cost taxpayers over 30 years. Overall the stadium definitely has plusses, but IMO it is still a rough deal for the taxpayers, I don't mind personally because I love the Vikings but the NFL could afford to build their own stadiums, or to build ones with a smaller subsidy.

The main study I was citing, http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2000/7/coates.pdf

Don't let the anti-Mormons or anti-theists bother you my friend, because they're not happy enough with their own life they feel the need to bring others down and get some sick kind of happiness from schadenfreude. Most Mormons I've encountered in my life have been truly great people, people who help others because they want to, people who seek no reward for good deeds, so if some keyboard warrior who has an inferiority complex feels the need to bring you down, just be happy with your own life. I'm sure you're a great guy, who just happens to hold a different belief to me.

I had to keep waking her up and near the end, she actually said to me, ""I'm sorry... but your teachers this year... SUCK... and HE doesn't help any.""

bosh-head,Guildwars2,1391062593.0,"&gt; Celestial is not a ""Jack of all trades, master of critical damage"" set, I doubt it was intended to be like that.

Well, those are the attributes that it had when people bought the gear.

&gt; I'd just rather the role of ""jack of all trades, master of none"" gets reinforced through an overall increase of stats instead of keeping Critical Damage unnaturally higher.

The point of gear attributes isn't to conform to some arbitrary notion of what seems ""natural"" (I'm not even sure what you mean by that?), but make gear *useful* for at least certain builds, without being overpowered.

The way celestial is right now, it is useful, but not overpowered. For some builds it is very strong, for other builds it's not. 

The way they are about to change it will move it from useful for some builds, to useful for none.

What they should do is just keep things consistent with the way they are now. Make the ferocity attribute higher on celestial gear so that it retains the parity with berserker gear on crit damage -- you know, the reason that people spent 5 days making each piece of celestial gear in the first place."

Now I am in my 20s, struggling to pay my bills and going to uni while working etc. But I am happy. 

If I was still at my parents' I wouldn't have to worry about bills, chores, food etc. I was pampered like crazy, however extremely depressed. There was times mum would go crazy demanding to know where I was when I was taking a f'in dump. 

When I first moved out, there was 4 straight months of tears and emotional blackmail. ""A good Muslim girl does not move out before marriage"" and ""why do you hate me?""

Trust me, it's worth it. It's hard growing up, but it is worth it. One day, when your parents aren't around anymore (horrifying to think about, but sadly it will happen) how will you handle things on your own? 

My parents have gone from treating me like I am 10 to treating me like an actual adult after moving out. Having a job doesn't automatically change the way they treat you. As soon as they realise you are no longer dependent on them, that's when things change.

Well, libertarians and ancaps talk a lot about the free market. As if, all market distortions are bad and the best system is a ""pure"" free market. I disagree. I think that intervention can create positive externalities for society. Right wingers seem to think we should get the heck out of economics and let the market work itself out, which is why I have a problem with a lack of ethics in economics.

I'm aware of men's lives being painful, not sure if I would say it is MORE painful - how do you quantify a person's troubles?  I've always been a good listener...and most of my bewilderment stages at this power happened when I was younger, when fellow girls opened up to me.  I would say barely anything, sometimes these are girls I never said more than 5 words to, and they'd give me their whole, sad, life story.  So in a sense, in relation to your first paragraph in the OP, I have had some ""training"" because women like to share feelings with each other.  I learned how to handle these situations a bit better and be that good listener...

There's a reason GOAT MJ shot 56.2% TS% (versus Kobe's 55.9% in '05-06) on his 37.4 ppg season! Reggie Jackson &amp; Ibaka probably have more talent combined than the rest of those Lakers rosters, and Lamb is pretty solid as well. The whole thing is just ridiculous.

If you follow LBJ carefully, you'll find that teams with smart defensive schemes make him a very average superstar (a bit of an oxymoron). In 2010, Kobe and LBJ both did equally awful versus a fantastic Celtic defense. In 2013, LBJ had relatively pedestrian (but still great!) series against great defenses like the Bulls and Spurs (though to be fair he crushed Indiana). MJ elevated his game to a level no one besides Shaq reached imo, whereas LBJ is GOAT against scrubs and ""just"" as good as any Top-10 player against elite teams (which is what matters imo)"

Penwyn,AskReddit,1391063406.0,"Happy to answer! I like talking about the family; they're cool men.

It's illegal for me to be legally married to both; we're in the United States. I have, however, been with my husband for eight years (married for 3.5, living together for 7), and I've been with my partner for three years in April. Once my partner and I get out of the job market slump (we're both engineers), we're going to have a ceremony. I don't think the US will allow polygamous marriage for a long time, probably not in my lifetime, so legality is off the table for the forseeable future.

I live with my husband; my partner lives with his brother. The only reason he doesn't live with us is that we may be relocating very soon, and getting a lease on a bigger apartment wouldn't be wise since we would most likely have to break it. When relocation happens, we're getting a house. We have spent an insane amount of time together, so we're not concerned about moving in together being a problem.

They interact daily. Both are PC gamers, and my partner plays a lot of games with his circle of friends. That circle of friends invited my husband along, so they're playing together very regularly. Husband and partner keep tabs on each other and support one another in a way which I can only describe as familial. There are no secrets in the group.

I am intimate with both, of course, but separately. My partner is strictly heterosexual, and my husband, while bisexual, isn't attracted to my partner like that. I suspect there would be too much manly beard mingling for his taste.

My husband alternates between serving tables and bartending. He has a degree in business management, but he hates it; I am being groomed by my father-in-law to work in the family business (agricultural engineering). When we have children, he wants to stay at home with the kids, which I have no problem with because he keeps house wonderfully and my partner and I will be able to afford the expense. Partner is a nuclear engineer, and I am a chemical engineer.

We aren't swingers. My partner is monogamous and has no interest in anyone but me, I like forming attachments and wouldn't want to be switched off, and my husband doesn't like the idea either. "

I'm not saying size 00 girls don't have uterus's, Just that at a certain point, the parts of our body that effect our shape and size is no longer just fat. 

When you are a healthy weight, all sorts of things contribute to your size, Your organs are the obvious one, But some people are born to be hour glass while other are born to be pears, little more than corsetry or surgury can fix that. Some women gain muscle easily on their arms but not on their bums causing their shape to be unique to them, Some women are tall and built strong, some women are petite. We always joke that there is ""no such thing as 'big boned'."" but there is, and its the reason people like Robyn Lawley will never be a size zero, not even if she died, and you stripped away everything but her skeleton.

I lost my virginity because of the sexual tension, and because my girlfriend was really open about it. I consider myself lucky - she wanted it as much as I.

If someone else is saying, ""Hey, I dropped $350 on these boots and that's a lot of money to me, so I want to keep them shiny and baby them and hope they last forever,"" then that's cool too.

PantheraLupus,AskReddit,1391064042.0,"Not kidnapped, per se. But I was detained and assaulted by a younger but bigger girl than me when I was 14. I wrote a post about it on /r/letsnotmeet so bear with me while I copy and paste it via mobile and edit as I paste and add spacing in since my browser keeps crashing with the effort.

Well, I'm going to give you a bit of background information first. When this particular incident occurred I was fourteen and a bit depressed. Well, pining after a guy who was a few years older than me, and therefore out of reach. On top of this I had been bullied my entire school life. So I spent a lot of time in deep thought. I lived in a beautiful place with rainforest encrusted mountains. It's always raining and it's just wonderful.
 So every afternoon I would go for a nice long walk in the rain, always the same way. It was peaceful and would allow me time to think. Often when I got home I would add another chapter to the novel I was writing. 

 Almost every time I would go for these walks, there would be a girl in a school uniform in front of her house. I recognised her as a girl in the year level below me at my school. She was quite tall, well built but not bulky. Fairly plain features. Well, one day I was going for my walk as usual. It was raining heavily and I was soaked. And there she was, as usual. She normally gives me a wave and watches me intently, yet for some reason this never freaked me out. 

This time she gestured for me to cross the road and speak to her.

""Oh! You're soaked! You should come in and have an orange juice."" She said, ""You'll catch a cold!"" I initially turned her offer down

""Well, at least come and sit on my patio with me until the rain slows down a bit!"" She says. At this point I decided I would do the polite thing and accepted her offer. I didn't feel creeped out at this point or anything, I was just nervous my stepdad would find out I was at somebody's house, which wasn't allowed and he had an uncanny way of finding things out. So we sat out on her patio and talked. She offered me orange juice again but I declined. I'm not exactly sure why. After a few minutes of talking she asked me again if I would like to come inside. I agreed. 

Bad fucking move.

 She led me to the kitchen and again offered me an orange juice. I declined yet again and she insisted. Growing a little suspicious I declined a little more firmly. So she got herself a drink. She then said she'd like me to stay and watch a movie with her.

""Okay, but I can't watch much of it. I have to get back home very soon. My stepdad will come looking for me if I don't."" So she closed all the doors and windows and shut all the curtains, turning all the lights off in the process. We sat on the couch to watch ""The Cat in The Hat"". I was really uncomfortable with the entire situation by now. I think I only watched fifteen minutes of the movie before I jumped up and claimed I had to go because My stepdad would go ballistic if I wasn't home soon. 

I went to the front door and tried to open it. It was locked, and could only be unlocked with a key (it was an old house). Getting a little freaked out, I went to the other door to find that locked too. Again, it required a key. What. The. Actual. Fuck. That bitch had locked me in.

 Starting to feel panicked but not showing it, I went back to the front door, hoping it would be magically unlocked. No luck. I turned around, and there she was. Right behind me. Smiling.

""Can you let me out, please? Can you unlock the door?"" I said

 Wordlessly she showed me the key, dangling it from her hand. I reached for it and she snatched her hand back. Then she dangled it in front of me again. I tried to snatch it out of her hand but she was quicker than me. She chuckled, and stuffed it into her bra, spreading her arms wide and saying 

""If you want they key, you'll have to come and get it.""

""Ew, what the fuck, I am NOT reaching into your bra!"" I said. I turned back to the door, trying to open it. When I turned back around she came towards me and tried to kiss me. I threw my arms up and she grabbed my wrists. We wrestled like that for a few moment and she let go of me, smiling. I was getting really freaked out by now but it hadn't clicked 100% what she wanted.

""Come on, come and get the key,"" she purred.

 So I tried to get to that key. I had had enough of this shit. But she tried to kiss me at the same time so the end result was more futile wrestling. By this time she was the one closer to the door, and now she had a crazy look in her eye. 

I did not like this. Not one fucking bit. She came towards me, and I automatically slipped into the fighting stance that I had recently learned in my Tae Kwon Do lessons. I had made it not every obvious, I had just placed my feet in the stance I had been taught, turned my body and my fist I brought behind me and not at my hip (I don't remember the exact stance so excuse me if I'm wrong, I only did a few lessons and that was six years ago, around the same time this happened).

She noticed and she actually laughed at me.""Hahaha! You think your martial arts bullshit is going to do anything? Alright then. I like it rough. Just no face blows.""

She launched herself at me but again this was for a kiss, and I grabbed her wrists this time and tried to push her away. She seemed to be enjoying this though. She slowly pushed me backwards. (I'm a rather slim individual, I don't have much power or weight unless I work out and I'm too lazy to keep that up for long). Inch by inch she pushed me back. I was straining, trying to resist her but she was bigger and stronger than me. The back of my leg hit something and I fell over backwards onto the couch. She jumped on top of me and went crazy, trying to grope me and kiss me.


 Pretty much instantly I punched her in the face and managed to kick her off, sending her flying into the wall. (That was my only advantage. My legs were strong as fuck). I took the advantage to spring back up. 


By now I was just angry as all hell. When she got up, she had blood on her face. She brought her hand to her bleeding lip, anger and delight, a strange and unnerving mix, on her face.

""I told you not the face."" She said quietly.

""JUST LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR HOUSE BITCH OR I WILL BURN YOUR FUCKING CUNT OFF!"" I screamed at her.

""Oh, fine then but you still have to come and get the key yourself."" So I marched up to her and grabbed the key out of her bra and got out the door. It was then that I spotted her poor dog. The poor darling was completely emaciated, and it ran up to me all excited. I patted it on the head and turn around to her.

""And feed this fucking dog. The poor thing is starving. Feed it or I'll call the RSPCA.""

""I have some meat inside for him. Can you help me cut it up? I have a sharp knife but I can't do it myself."" She said. Okay that was fucking creepy

""Fuck off, you sick bitch. I'm going."" I said, and promptly noped the fuck out of there and went home and cried my eyes out. 

I never told my parents.

Oh god you do not know how hard that was to fix on an old galaxy S1.

Later I learned some more pose from my therapist, she introdued me to the meditation side of yoga, but again, it was ""here is how you clear your mind, here is how you should feel after""

I then learned more about breathing and pacing from my myotherapist, she is much more embracive of the 'hippy' side to yoga, because mindfulness is a strong pain relief and healing tool. But the weirdest thing she ever said was ""try doing yoga while naked, just try it, tell me what you felt that was different"" 

The creepiest thing I was ever asked/told was by my women's health physio who said ""oh, you do yoga? that's great, I want you to masturbate immediately after you finish"" The logic was I would be really relaxed after yoga, so much so that I could overcome my sexual tension.

kiwirish,AskReddit,1391064071.0,"&gt;No. Democracy doesn't work. We are a republic. In a republic the government establishes the laws and protects individual liberties. If you let the masses dictate what is good for everyone you just end up with a bunch of upset people. 

However the republic was designed so that states can individually create their own laws according to the dictates of their own morals. What individial liberties has Utah ever infringed on?

&gt;For instance; you have four options. A, B, C, and D. Rather than let people pick what they want from an infinite variety, they have to chose one of four ""major"" choices. So let's say 20% pick A, 30% pick B, 20% pick C, 20% pick D and 10% didn't care for any of those choices. 

&gt;So 30% of the people (who picked B) get what they want and the other 70% are screwed. Democracy fails to protect individual liberties in this situation.

That's the problem with FPP which was not what we were debating. A multi round system would be better.

&gt;It is absurd to say it's OK for the ""majority"" (which it hardly is, by the way) of people in one state to subjugate the other people to their religious ideas because they happened to turn up to vote. 

Ever stopped to think that it isn't just the Mormons that vote for certain things? And that people are entitled to their own opinions, a right afforded to them by the very republic that you so stand for? You're a fucking hypocrite.

&gt;Everyone should get what they want - provided it doesn't infringe on other people. You shouldn't have to jump through Mormon hoops just because you live in Utah. 

Well the thing is, the laws of the land are run by democracy, if the plurality want it how can you argue against it? That's precisely what America was founded on, freedom from government oppression.

&gt;It is for that exact reason our government was created as a republic. 

You're once again a hypocrite, and a sad person who feels the need to bring people down to feel happy. You have an irrational and distorted view of religion so you can feel important and get attention. As such I'm ceasing this discussion from here. I hope one day you realise the irony of your own intolerance and actually become a happy person who can handle other people being happy believing what they want.

I'll take your word about your good eye. Just keep making work that you like. From this reply, you obviously don't need to convince me or dunwichType that you can do this. You and I both now that most employers/clients expect any one in the GD field to be fluent in the Adobe Creative Suite. Familiarising with the software will already give you one HUGE step ahead if you decide to enroll in an online program.  
From here, I'm going to say that you seem to have done lots of research, and you would know more than most who would respond on this thread. Many would probably tell you that they learned a whole lot more working in the real world, paid or not. It won't hurt to try the online program you think it's best, so why the hell not.  
At the end of the day, a common perception of GD is that it's 'art that is practical.' But with that practicality, it means it needs purpose, design briefs and clients. It's a cut throat industry as you can imagine.  
  
On another note. If you can find the opportunity, volunteer! Not only will you learn about production on the job, but you'll learn how to talk about your work or the goals of the design job, talking about needs with several people. You'll also get to build your portfolio. I have volunteered, I understand what it feels like to seem illegitimate and inexperienced.

My hard drive was replaced shortly before so I had it lying around in an enclosure but didn't really need it otherwise, which may not be applicable for you (but an SSD is definitely worth it, even if you don't use your computer all the time, and a godsend if you do and makes my 2 year old laptop feel like new again), so this might have shades of false economy (buying the hard drive new would result in a similar cost to deal).

The same surrounding counties that REFUSE to allow MARTA into their backyard. The same counties that turned down the TSPLOST when it was proposed. You can blame the weather, you can blame the city, you can blame the southern drivers that ""can't drive"" in the snow but this problem lies 100% on the shoulders of the our society and the lack of willingness to pay for the necessary things to properly run a city. It's 100% on voters who elected politicians who only advance their own situation without addressing the enormous issues we face. Until 51% of society is ready realize ""tax and spend"" isn't a four letter word and great cities are built on people pitching in to make important changes 100% of these problems are our own fault. If you aren't willing to sacrifice for the good of society and its future you have nobody to blame but yourself.

What reddit has (flair, in fact that post has flair on it) is pretty much what you want, really... but that's controlled by mods which ensures (hopefully) that it's accurate.

What you're asking for here:

1) requires a centralized server to store all that data.

2) more problematic: relies on the teeming masses to be honest.  All it takes is one jerk to go mass tag a bunch of videos with who knows what on it, and it's ruined for everybody...

Yes, there are solutions to #2 - like forcing people to register with an account tied to personally identifiable information to discourage it... or like only letting tags show up if some threshold is hit (but let's say it's 10 - how much stuff never sees a tag because not enough people tagged it fast enough?)... or allowing people to create ""trusted networks"" of users whose tags they trust...

but all of these things are not really ""RES feature requests""... 

they're requests for a completely new addon with centralized data storage and a really great number of moving parts.

I'm not suggesting it can't be done -- it's just not really right as an addon to RES. In fact, a service like this shouldn't be restricted to reddit - it should be internet-wide...

Which brings to mind [Web of Trust](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wot/bhmmomiinigofkjcapegjjndpbikblnp?hl=en) - a commonly used addon (that unfortunately sometimes interferes with / breaks RES) that is actually somewhat similar in concept.

I know you said you saw a counsellor and they didnt offer advice, but I wonder what advice would really help you right now?

I'm wary of drawing a conclusion based on sex but I don't have a hard time with male bartenders getting to me, even in a bar packed to the brim.  I've started to think that female bartenders may suspect I'm some crappy girl who will waste their time and not tip....your post is kinda reinforcing that.  Recently I went to a pub and the female bartender was very aloof; I had asked her what whiskeys they got.  She said ""A lot"" and went to another customer.  I couldn't see the labels on the bottles very well with the dim lighting ... and I guess my eyesight is questionable.  Got her attention after some time and asked for Bulliet, she seemed surprised...apologized that it's the one bourbon they didn't have.  I ordered my back up drink and she was very friendly and attentive after that.  Strange 180.  Thinking now she thought I was like the girls you described...There IS a dorm 1-2 blocks away, and I look like I could be in that age group.

After that, maybe even take some self defense classes, and not karate, that stuff has been dumbed down to the point of nothingness. Try boxing, kickboxing, or even judo. If that STILL doesn't work, you should go out, walk to him/her and ask why they bully you, be logical, quick and reasonable.

 ""Because I don't like your face"" Oh, I understand, those who don't fall under your subjective view of beauty must be bullied and shunned away right? Do you even understand what you're doing? Do you? It's possible that I might be scarred for the rest of my life, which will effect you more than you think it will.

 ""Are you threatening me?"" No, no, no, I'm sorry if I came off that way, I really didn't mean it, however what I'm saying is that by me being scarred, it will effect the people around me, so you bulling me is not *only* effecting me, it effects you too. When you go out and understand that you can actually be killed for acting like you are now, you'll feel bad, or at least if you're human you will. 

If he/she then tries to attack you, try defending yourself, don't just hide in a corner and wait for the punches/kicks/insults. Defend yourself. Run away if you think there's a chance of escaping. Don't run away if there's no actual chance of escaping, you're stronger than you think. (And it's a lot harder to move a squirming target than you think)"

LinguistHere,KerbalAcademy,1391065402.0,"Yeah, polar (or near-polar) orbits work very well for stations like this... as long as you don't mind waiting up to several days for things to come back into alignment, anyway.

From Kerbin to the Mun, entering a polar orbit costs no more than entering an equatorial orbit.

From the surface of the Mun, it costs almost the same amount of fuel to enter a polar orbit versus an equatorial orbit due to the slow rate of munar rotation. Same holds true for landing from a polar orbit versus landing from an equatorial orbit.

And from Munar orbit, it's true that you need to wait until the correct planar alignment if you want an efficient burn back to Kerbin, but once you're aligned, the burn itself is just as efficient as a burn from the equator.

Edit: One other benefit is that objects in polar orbits spend more time in sunlight on average, assuming that the planet/moon's plane of revolution around the sun is close to or equal to the plane of the planet/moon's equator. The worst-case scenario is a normal day-night cycle like you'd get in orbiting the equator; the best-case scenario is constant sunlight."

I base my menu around these items when I need to tighten the belt. I can't buy lettuce for day-to-day eating because it always ends up getting thrown out. Celery doesn't last long so I buy those individually if I can.

Pita bread freezes and unfreezes well, if you are trying to reduce your bread intake. I use it to make all sorts of things, including mini pizza.

I buy pork loin roasts when they are on sale and then cut them up into chops and stick in the freezer. That saves a bit of money. I could do the same with whole chicken, but I hate cutting chicken.

I realise that it's pointless to be afraid of and saddened by death because of it's inevitability, but that doesn't change the fact I am - I'm only human. I am saddened by the fact I won't be able to see changes in the world that I couldn't even imagine (Good or bad), I am saddened that I won't be able to experience the changes and contribution I make to nature.

With a lot of new animals and cool additions, I was very pumped to finally get to play! And I love it just as much as I thought I would, if not more. I'm on it pretty much every day.

Pokemon X and Y - Once again, huge fan of the series. I was excited because I thought finally getting to customize your trainer was amazing, things like wondertrade also make the game a ton of fun. Oh, and I really liked the starters. I'm a huge fan of foxes, so a fire fox starter? I'm in. AND getting a second first gen starter! And Amie! Seriously, this game is absolutely fantastic.

Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward - OH MY GOSH. This was absolutely the main reason I've wanted a 3DS for as long as I have. I managed to play the original 999 and was absolutely hooked. It was an amazing story with amazing characters and when I found out there was a sequel, I was so happy. It even had Clover as a returning character, Clover was my favorite in the original! However, that happiness was then promptly crushed when I found out it was only on the 3DS, which I don't own, nor do I know anyone who owns it. This is the main factor that came into play with my decision. This game wasn't as good as the original to me, but I didn't expect it to be. Clover was awesome, though I didn't like her voice actress much. Phi was also awesome. I'm excited for Zero Escape 3!

That's pretty much it, though I might as well mention a few that were also factors, however slight. This includes DS games because at this point we no longer have an original DS, and we haven't for years. Anyway, runner ups!

ruta_skadi,AskWomen,1391065904.0,"Being polite is something you should do to any person regardless of their age or gender. In general you shouldn't do things for a woman that you wouldn't for a man. It is indeed outdated and those social customs come out of a worldview that saw women as inferior, fragile, weak, and unable to do things on their own. That doesn't mean *you* see women that way, but those actions have those connotations. They are also from a much more formal time. For instance, I would find it incredibly weird if men stood up when I entered. I would also recommend behaving in a way that fits in with the culture where you are. It's not really more polite to do something that contradicts the social norms of that time and place. 

The one exception to this is within romantic relationships depending on her preferences. It's one thing to do this stuff when taking a woman on a date- it's ok if she likes it. But it would not be ok to do this to, say, a female coworker. Women are your equals so they should be treated as such. We aren't delicate flowers that need special treatment. "

**In media...**

There is a concern that people will believe it's possible to attain something unattainable.

There is a concern that people will adopt unrealistic expectations of beauty, form, and health.

There is a concern that people will be encouraged to adopt unhealthy lifestyles.

There is a concern regarding the way that these images will collectively influence our cultural definition of beauty and health.

There is a concern that products are not being presented realistically.


**Outside of media...**

There is a concern that you're not presenting yourself as you truly are (probably a bigger concern in online contexts).

I've read arguments like ""It is wrong even if not traumatic, as the child does not know what he/she is doing and what the act means for the adult. They should not be doing something they don't fully know about.""

Let's take the example of a child performing on stage. He may not know the exact nature of joy that the parent feels on seeing their child up there, but I doubt anyone feels that there is anything wrong with a child(without parental pressure) performing on stage."

I don't think it's fair to say that people who aren't married aren't as stable. It would be more useful to say that people who don't view their relationship as something that is permanent and to be maintained are less stable, regardless of whether they are actually married or not.

The entire project was scrapped because the media ran a bunch of articles about these ""domestic military drones"" which were just 2 foot wide quadrocopters equipped with a cameras and a remote control, and the uninformed public went into an outcry.

2edgy420me,Frugal,1391067085.0,"So much this. It's why I don't over do it when people order double anything greasy/juicy. Pineapples, green peppers and tomatoes are the WORST. Some of the meats, too. Thin crust also sucks when people order too much. Ours tends to come out pretty floppy. I've gotten the same complaints.

All meat doesn't mean TONS of meat. Double doesn't mean a pound. If you order a pizza with extra/lots of toppings and expect it to *not* be floppy/greasy/undercooked/parts overcooked because I had to keep shoving it back in the oven - you're gonna have a bad time.

I promise, most places aren't cheating you. We just know how to handle a pizza so you are happy with it! :) I've worked at my current shop for 4+ years. It's really my only ever job and I love it. I work hard and I try to make new customers come back and old customers stay. I enjoy having people ask for me personally or calling just to compliment my work or saying that they've got a new favorite pizza place. If I ever perfect a way to make a topping heavy pizza that doesn't come out cooked shitty, I will let the world know. For now, I'll just stick with what I know and try to inform people so they know I'm not ripping them off. I also can recommend cooking at home, when you have time, because it may be easier for you to experiment and come up with a thicker pizza that holds as much as you want of whatever. It's fun, usually comes out tasting amazing and really fun for kids. Oh, and usually, cheaper. 

Oh and side note: thin pizzas at my shop are literally giant tortilla wraps or whatever. If you want a crispy thin, they're super cheap to buy it this way. Also, if anyone is a fan of ""flavored crusts"" (don't wanna say the name of where I work but if you know the place, you know what I mean!) just ask and I can help you all replicate it at home.

In Winterfell, I doubt Jon really knew that queer people existed, aside from jokes at their expense (stories of transfeminine sex workers and the like). I think he  never really examined his gay feelings until after he made out with Satin (which totally happened and you can't tell me otherwise.) I think he really did love Ygritte though, and I think he still finds women attractive, but I like to pretend that there's something more there. Also, the sexuality of characters where it isn't relevant never really show up in their PoVs.

mrpoopistan,asktrp,1391067249.0,"What I'm going to say next isn't actual game advice, it's just a statement of how game works for me . . .

First off, I'm a decently attractive guy who's been getting into shape, traveling, making money and game-aware for quite a while. I'm in my mid 30s BTW.

Second, most game-aware guys would describe me as someone who had a lot of natural aloof jerk game to start with.

For me a lot of what I gained from PUA, TRP, game, manosphere, etc was about middle and late game stuff. I never was an approach anxiety guy, although TRP allowed me to go from good to weaponized.

The big thing that I always worry about is an over-played hand of alpha. 

Now I always prefer to open full alpha jerk. Everything is fair game with me, but my preferred game is identifying her favorite thing and playfully tearing it shreds like a fuckin terrier. Last night I had a girl who's an English major damn near ready to punch me for calling her favorite author, James Joyce, a ""fuckin filthy Irishman"".

But I like to dial it down and drop a little sweet beta play in there once I've ginned them up. I'm partial to a ""you're a cute kid"" that has a little neg still in there, a little awareness of the age difference, and non-committal enough that she doesn't really know if I'm just saying something meaningless or actually hitting on her. Then we'll play a round of softer alpha jerk game

Girls constantly ply me with ""I'm worried you're gonna pull the rug out from under me"" or like this girl last night who went apeshit sending me every nude pic she apparently ever took and then basically told me that she felt like I didn't see her as girlfriend material.

That's where I'm at with game. I worry waaaaay more about overplaying an alpha hand and not offering enough emotional maintenance than I do about appearing beta.

For me, I'd spend the $20 the OP was up against in a heartbeat, and I'd do something astonishingly ignorant to make up for it.

So, my tip would be to ask a million questions! Keep in good contact with your department on what they want and keep up with these things early in the process so you wont be overwhelmed overall.

BuildMyPaperHeart,Warframe,1391067539.0,"It's a topic that's come up a lot with the new systems in place. There have been a few giveaway threads earlier, but they're likely taken down by now. You can try skimming /r/WarTrade to see if anyone else is doing a giveaway currently.

Anyway, here are a few tips specific to your queries:

&gt; Vital sense

http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Vital_Sense - Drops from Corpus Prod Crewmen and as a Tier 2 Survival Reward. 

I actually never use this mod XD Crit builds aren't my thing! You can get plenty viable performance out of weapons with other mods. What primary are you using? Perhaps its base stats are not ideal for the faction you're fighting.

&gt; that energy regen aura

Energy Siphon? It's a fantastic aura, I'll give you that, but it's far from necessary. Other Auras, while considered ""lesser"" than Energy Siphon, still have their uses, especially one levels where Energy Orbs abound (which, with careful energy management, is every level!). Rifle Amp (Rifle Damage+), Regeneration (Health Regen), and Enemy Radar (enemies appear on minimap within certain range) are all fairly useful when applied! Corrosive Projection (Enemy Armor-) also gets a notable mention.

&gt; ESPECIALLY serration

http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki/Serration - Drops from Grineer Scorpions, Infested Nauseous/Electric Crawlers, Stalker, General Sargus Ruk, as a Tier 2 Defense Reward and a Survival Reward. 

I'll give you this one; Serration is a bit tough to obtain. However, you'd be surprised how not necessarily necessary this is. If you tailor your BASE DAMAGE STATS to the right type for the faction you're fighting, you can actually get pretty good performance out of it!

Remember that, with Damage 2.0, base damage is now a total of three different types:

* Puncture (best against Grineer and Corpus armor)
* Impact (best against Corpus shields)
* Slash (best against Flesh of all kinds, especially Infested)

By using the more commonly available PUNCTURE+, IMPACT+, or SLASH+ mods, you can increase the correct damage type with good effectiveness! Granted, Serration boosts all three damage types simultaneously, but boosting the right type and adjusting your elemental mods for the faction you're fighting goes a long way!

&gt; stonewalled from progression

Where exactly are you stuck? If you're trying to hit the Level 30 enemies, note that your Warframe/Weapon Level and Enemy Level are **not** equivalent, [as explained in our FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_the_difference_between_mastery_rank.2C_weapon.2Fwarframe_level.2C_enemy_level.2C_and_difficulty_level.3F).

What if it's genetic though?  Is it ethical to bring a child into the world at great expense to possibly condemn them to having fertility issues when they're 25 and eager for a kid?

When babies are in utero, there is a small capillary connecting the aorta and pulmonary artery, allowing oxygen to reach the body. It slowly starts to close a few hours after the baby takes its first breath. 
This will be prevented in the hospital by drugs called prostaglandins.

You're lucky you know about this ahead of time. We didn't with my daughter. She started turning blue when her ductis started to close, and we were rushed from a small hospital in Olympia, WA, to Seattle Childrens while she was on the prostaglandins. There, the cardiology team decided she was not physically big enough to perform the TGA correction, so they placed a gore-tex shunt to take the place of her ductis so she can grow. We are still waiting on the actual artery switch operation. She saw her cardiologist yesterday, he says it can wait until she is around two. She's almost one right now.

You can be so much more prepared than I was. Do your research! Get some time off work if you can manage it for after the birth. Your baby will be in the neonatal intensive care unit. Possibly for a long time. 

It's going to be ok. I didn't really have anyone to tell me that and I felt so helpless. There was my daughter and there was nothing I could do to help her. But it gets better. 

Right now, my daughter is no different than any other one year old. If i didn't tell you she had major heart surgery at twelve days old, you wouldn't even know. My wife and I found a ton of support groups online and most people on them say the same things. There are even adults who were born with CHDs in the groups who've grown up and are doing fine. 

If you need help from someone who's been through this, PM me.

If only they thought like sociologists or political scientists instead of philosophers. They would understand how their philosophical principles can be abused and how their rhetoric can actually be used for selfish ends.

I also find it funny how they actually do demonstrate these skeptical behaviors in application to the state, while completely ignoring them as far as their business goes. At least in my topic I was willing to admit the state isn't perfect. That yeah, it can be abusive. But that, in referencing capitalism and going on about property rights, they totally ignore how this rhetoric falls into certain elites' interests.

Australia actually went to decimal currency before Britain in the 1950's. But of course America always used Dollars and cents, though the money situation was pretty strange and bad up until the middle 1800's.

Christ died for you because he loves you, not so you could owe him one.  It's your life, the best way to honor God is to live it as best you can - even if that's not terribly successful yet.  Privilege is a funny thing - feeling guilty for it is natural, but you can't *do* anything about being privileged.  It's not your fault, and it's not your doing.

I don't know what your family/financial situation/expectations are (they can be rather complicating), but if you're in uni and it's not working for you, who's to say you have to do it right now?  Talk to some favorite profs or the counseling/career center (not sure what they call it in the not-US), but there's nothing wrong with stepping away from uni, getting some perspective and real life under your belt, and maybe giving it another go when you're better equipped for it.  A supposed ticket to a better life isn't going to do you any good if you get burned out trying to get it.

abcd_z,asktrp,1391068099.0,"Not specific questions, but general tips:  

**Open-ended questions:**  
Avoid yes/no questions. Your questions should be open-ended.  ""Got any family in the area?"" would be a poor question, but ""What do you do for fun?"" is good.  

**Silence**  
When you ask a question, be comfortable with silence.  If you rush to fill the silence yourself, it cancels the pull the other person would feel to answer the question.  Just wait and have confidence that the other person will answer.  

**Sandwich questions and stories:**  
If somebody gives you a one-word answer, don't follow it up with more questions.  That just seems try-hard.  
Instead, answer your own question and tell a story about yourself.  
""What do you do for work?""  
""I'm unemployed.""  
""Sorry to hear that. I couldn't find a job, so I wound up going back to college. Now I'm taking a class in Web Design so that I can get a job that lets me travel.""  
Pause to allow the other person to relate.  If not, ask another open-ended question.  
""So where would you travel, if you could go anywhere?""  

The more you tell about yourself, the likelier they are to find something to relate to.  

**Free-associate:**  
Each new subject of the conversation can have nothing to do with the one before it.  Think of a stand-up comedian: they go from one unrelated joke to the next, but we really don't care.  You can do the same thing.  
If you're having trouble thinking of what to say next, just start free-associating mentally.  When you come up with something, just blurt it out!  You'll make mistakes along the way, but as long as you learn from those mistakes it shouldn't be a problem.  

Good luck!  :)"

Quite a few yoga poses are good for building core/upper body strength. if anything seems easy, i just hold the pose until it's hard to maintain proper form. there's lots of resources online, you could browse yogajournal.com by anatomical focus. 

i just started lifting using the program from the book, new rules of lifting for women. i started as injury prevention for other sports, but began to really enjoy weightlifting on its own as well. if you have weights, it's doable from home, and you can start really light to make sure your form is okay before pushing yourself.

AFormidableContender,AskMen,1391068482.0,"&gt;Because I prefer to pass my classes. I can already tell by some of your statements that talking to you about this further is just going to turn into a war of attrition until one of us just gets tired of repeating their same talking points over and over again. I have a feeling you talk (debate) many feminists and this is just another way for you to express your ire towards women in general.

Most of that is true. I **DO** debate a lot feminists, and most their arguments are old, and tired, and by this point in my feminist-slaying career, easily defeated. 

I wouldn't necessarily say it's purely an outlet to direct my dislike of women. That's a step too far. 

&gt;I see no substantive purpose in continuing this further because if the dozens of feminists who came before me didn't change your mind, I certainly don't have time to beat my head against a wall and type out words that fall on deaf ears.

Maybe you're a hyper feminist. Maybe convincing feminism haters to be champions of female privilege is your super power?

&gt; I've learned to pick my battles and if I saw any hope of reaching common ground, I would willingly continue this; however, we both know your mind is pretty made up.

I think I would call myself extremely jaded with defences of feminism, than simply having my mind made before. Everyone's mind is pretty made before an argument or debate...it's other people's job to give them a reason to re-evaluate.

I use baby oil (mineral oil) and I do it as a way to get my make-up off or every few days if I feel like my face needs it.

Also, don't be under the impression that OCM makes them go away completely or makes them pop out. It doesn't. They're still there and I can still see them.

I don't see why vaping without nicotine would be a problem since all your friend would be inhaling is vapor am I correct? I guess you could grow a little mental addiction to this after a while if you've smoked cigarettes in the past but I could be wrong. 

Anyways nicotine or not I 100% support electronic cigarettes. I vaped for a year and I felt amazing. My lungs were healthy, my taste was back, I didn't smell like a hamsters asshole, and I could smell again. 

The only reason I'm not vaping right now is because when I leave for basic I have to be without nicotine completely. I felt it'd be a smarter choice to quit before I left, rather than quit cold turkey while I've got some 200 pound muscle head in my face yelling at me. 

So finally imo if I wanted to quit the best method for me would be cold turkey since I don't have the best self discipline to limit my cigarettes or limit how much I vape. This may vary from person to person but I've found electronic cigarettes just to be another form of getting nicotine. It didn't help me quit. "

Dantilli,socialskills,1391069085.0,"I know exactly how you feel. A year ago I was exactly the same, even now there are some times I catch myself making excuses. The whole reason I started visiting reddit was for these subs, to get past my problems.

Now, that helpless anxious feeling is NOT going to go away on it's own. The good thing is, you can actually recognise it, you know it's there. The fact that you can feel it so accutely is to your advantage, it gives you motivation.

So, how did I get past all this crap? how did I stop with the excuses and the worrying and the hating myself? I got fucking sick of it, that's how. I'd suffered this anxiety so long that literally nothing could be worse to me. Not only was it almost painful but I was actually becoming BORED of it. I'd spent so much time in anxiety that, one day, I just lost it. I literally screamed ""FUCK YOU ANXIETY, I'M SICK OF YOUR SHIT!!!!"" went out to a bar and started talking to people. Just before I'd approach someone my anxiety would hit hard, I'd see the excuses running through my head. But no, no anxiety, you're not stopping me this time, no fucking way. I'm doing what I want.

Sounds a bit extreme but the day after I was the happiest guy alive. I knew that I could beat it, I didn't have to be held back by it anymore. It still hasn't gone away, it's much less powerful, but it's still there. But now that I know I CAN beat it, it just doesn't hold power over me.

Since then I started living by the phrase ""If in doubt, try it out"". If I have any doubt as to whether to approach someone or anything else that I want to do in my life. Even if I come up with almost legitimate reasons for not doing it, if I have doubt, If I'm not certain, I give it a try anyway. Strangely this helps a lot, it takes much less willpower to follow a previously considered rule than to try and force myself into every situation individually.

Another thing that helps is to not give yourself time to think. The instant you even think about talking to the guy at the bust stop you're already walking towards him. Allow yourself to act without thinking it through. Give yourself permission to go and say hi to someone without thinking about what could happen. Let yourself analyse it AFTERWARDS if necessary, but in the moment, just let yourself gather the data.

Finally, You don't have to put so much pressure on yourself. You don't have to be amazing all the time. Start small. Give yourself the goal of just talking to one random person a day. Or maybe just a week, doesn't have to be every day. Just don't think that because you approach one person that you HAVE to do it EVERY DAMN TIME. No, you don't, just do it once, dip your toe in the waters. 

One challenge I used to do was every 3 days I would go out to a bar for an hour and commit myself to approaching people. Trying my best for just that one hour. Outside of that I put no pressure on myself to do anything social. I still did the things I was already comfortable with but that was it. After a while, the things that you're comfortable with increase in number and I stopped dreading that hour quite as much. Fast forward 6 months and I'm now at exactly how I've always wished to be. I actually have more problems with my work ethic than social anxiety, that would have been a ridculous suggestion back then, but it's true.

It's ok to only try it once in a blue moon if that's all you feel you can manage, just make sure you do it once EVERY blue moon. A consistent, small effort gives more benefits than a one of a time large one (most of the time).

I know this is a massive amount of words but I hope you read it and take something from it. Even if it's just that it IS possible to get past this crap. Good luck :)"

So King Haakon and Crown Prince Olav did not trust the Swedes and escaped to England with the Norwegian gold reserve in small trawlers, fishingboats.

&gt;Setting that aside though, I think my biggest complaint against your AMA/you is your quasu-anti-philosophy angle. There are valid and 'liberal' philosophical versions of American Liberalism. Your rejection of philosophical theory seems more like an admission that it's 'too hard for you'.

It's not too hard, although I do see it as rather tedious and pointless. The thing is, philsophy creates models, or from my more scientific perspective, ""hypotheses."" 

I actually studied a lot of political and moral theory in college and grad school. I just see it of limited application because no one model is right, and all become bat**** insane when taken to the extreme. I think utilitarianism is the best since I think it's the most straight to the point, but even that I'll sometimes ignore.

pHScale,philadelphia,1391069757.0,"I do traffic studies around the city of Philadelphia for a living. Here is my quick assessment.

[Roosevelt and Red Lion](http://goo.gl/maps/3G9kE)

I imagine the problem here is the double northbound left turn lanes opposing the single southbound left turn lane with no clear indication from one side of what the other is doing (e.g. dashed lines in the intersection). Add faded stop bars, inner/outer drives, and high pedestrian traffic and you have a nightmare.

[Roosevelt and Grant](http://goo.gl/maps/2PzJL)

I'm not sure what makes this intersection so bad. I've definitely seen worse in the city (like [Island and Lindbergh](http://goo.gl/maps/52ifS)). Visibility isn't an issue, with two empty lots adjacent to the intersection. The signals are sensor controlled, so there shouldn't be a problem with bad signal timing. One-way signs are present on the outer drives, nobody's parking, and the crosswalks even have pedestrian heads.

But I think I know the problem here: the red light camera. It's not like they try to hide it, so people know its there. People will drive erratically trying to avoid a ticket. For example, I've seen people stop at a GREEN light, to make sure it wasn't red at camera monitored intersections in Philly (not this intersections, but ones like it). I've also seen people stop in the middle of the intersection once the light turned red, refusing to move.

Get rid of the camera at Grant and paint some lines at Red Lion, and everything should be fine.

But the city would laugh at me if I told them to take away their cash cow."

i've seen so many friends have the same list at a minimum if not longer and not one of them has a boyfriend or has had a boyfriend since high school.

ladies think about it, if they had all that what makes you think they would be interested in you. so many women have these unrealistic lists you might as well be waiting forever. 

cooking. it is not sexists to want a girlfriend that knows how to cook. from the dating i've done and the friends i have at some point in time some women started thinking that learning to cook demeaning or will set women back in some way. 

i sure as shit will not do all the cooking and i expect a woman to know the basics of cooking just in case one day we want to start a family we are not going to be eating out every time i don't cook.

By the time a kid hits 10 they've very much like an adult, though one with more emotional needs and a shorter attention span.

floataway3,magicTCG,1391070019.0,"I agree hating someone out of the game is equally unfun, but my friends would complain even if they had the advantage. Example: One of my friends has an Oloro life gain deck, I am playing Trostani GW stompy. I know if I don't deal with him fast, he will be gaining thousands of life per turn (Serra avatar + Wall or Reverence is a nasty combo) and I will have no hope. He knows that is how our decks balance out, yet still cries foul when I aim my initial swings at him instead of my brother's slower Thraximunder deck (my brother is also a weaker player, I can expect a few misplays to grant me some turns to deal with him). I don't think it is hating to take care of someone while I still can."

justgivingsomeadvice,lakers,1391070044.0,"Yup that's a good point. If you told me KD and LBJ are more efficient players than Kobe (and MJ for that matter) I would agree. But, that isn't generalizable to averaging 27 shots or so like Kobe (and MJ) did.

I can't speak for MJ but KD and especially LBJ have the sort of discipline and good shot selection Kobe never had. I'm not trying to understate this, it's a really important point! Efficiency is the biggest reason Kobe will never be seen as a Top 5 player.

That said, just like Kobe on a championship team would never have a 65% TS%, I don't believe LBJ or KD could have put up 35.4 on 56% TS% given the teammates Kobe had. 

I would qualify this by making an observation nobody likes to hear: KD gets waaaaaaay more calls than Kobe got in his prime, which is pretty important in terms of decreasing missed FGs and increasing total points (which of course massively inflates your TS%). For reference, KD is shooting 10.1 FTs on 14.6 2FGs (ignore 3s because you don't get fouled on them); Kobe averaged 10.2 FTs on 20.7 2FGs. If KD averaged 27 FGs and still got his current FT rate, he'd probably average 15 FTs and would be scoring 40 PPG. So there's that.

Anyways this was a bit of a rambling, long-winded post. But the tl;dr is yeah I agree with what you're saying, Kobe never was as efficient as KD and LBJ are. And I don't think KD or LBJ could actually score the way Kobe did in his prime. You might find the former a more valuable trait but I see it as Kobe dominating in a context that KD and LBJ couldn't quite do, and vice-versa.

* my mate and I frequently join 2 different servers to see which has the better performance. Then, the other will join the better server. I guess that's screwed now, but that's neither here or there in comparison to the others.

He did go on to discover that their methods, ideas, or teachings were incomplete, but he had the minds of many before him to stand upon as we have the minds of many to stand upon ourselves.

kiwirish,rugbyunion,1391071026.0,"&gt;Lol, fitness... How many rowers scrum down, get hit by a 100 kg raging prop running in full flight leaving them with bruising the full length of the upper body? Ultra marathon runners are ridiculously fit but I don't think any of them would compare their sport to rowing let alone rugby. 

A lot actually, considering that most High School rowers are also in their school 1st XV. Bruising? Bitch please that's easy to recover from, any professional complaining about a bruise doesn't deserve to be a professional.

&gt;Ice hockey is a slightly more intelligent (only slightly) comparison but still shows no knowledge of either sport, its rules and player welfare. How much playing time does an ice hockey player get? Rolling substitutions and injury lay-offs are not as common as in rugby due to padding (concussion is though). You are making a comparisson with a sport that outside of concussion has no relationship with rugby, have a chat with an ice hockey player who has played rugby, I have, they still play ice hockey but stopped rugby due to injuries. 

1. I am an ice hockey player, 2. I have played rugby for 15 years, so you can kindly shut the fuck up. Considering I've played both, I can promise you that hockey is a much tougher sport on the body and endurance wise. Ice hockey shifts are short, but they're done at high speed, sprinting the whole time, and 30 minutes of sprinting on and off is a lot harder than 80 minutes that is mostly jogging. Again I have experience in both sports which you don't, so your trolling comment is laughable.

Padding? Fuck have you ever skated? Ice hockey hits are a lot harder (Energy equaling half mass times velocity **squared**) and onto a much harder surface. A rugby hit is nothing compared to an open ice hit. Your ice hockey player will be playing non-check hockey, professional hockey players have checking, play 3-4 times as many games a season and still have longer careers. If pro rugby players can't handle two years without a rest they don't deserve to be pros.

&gt;I'm going to assume you are trolling given the laughable level of knowledge that flies in the face of every player welfare report since the 80's (plus I have you tagged as a troll)  :-) 

Cool, tag me as a troll, the irony is that I actually have knowledge and statistics helping my claim and you just have blind insults and anecdotal *evidence* blinded by your own team's terrible performance after a Lions tour."

Ice storms are more common than snow falls in Atlanta, but they're still rare enough (it generally happens a handful of times a year) that the infrastructure of the city and many native tree species are not well equipped for it. 

It causes very serious problems—not just ice on the road, but lots of damage to loblolly pine trees in particular (which are ubiquitous in Atlanta, and quite brittle and tall). Ice-laden pine trees have a tendency to fall on houses, power lines, and roads. [This](http://www.stormreports.org/images/mayfield_ice3.jpg) is a common sort of sight.

I've never heard ""freezing rain"" used to mean anything else, and I'm not really sure what you're referring to here. Can you provide an example of someone using ""freezing rain"" to refer to normal ice? Because Atlanta certainly gets lots and lots of ice (frozen puddles, black ice on roads, some ice on the ground from previous rains or thawed snow, etc.) in the winter, but I've never heard *anyone* call this ""freezing rain""—it's not even rain!"

There's a stigma that was drilled into me and all of my peers in high school that any path forward other than college or university was pretty much failure.

I wasted so much time and money on an education and career path that I didn't truly want, making myself miserable, before I could finally admit that it wasn't the life for me. I now work a basic job in a factory, and I've never been happier or more fulfilled. I'm a secular Taoist so  simplicity and frugality are a big part of my core values, and I think personal success depends entirely on how you definite it and how you choose to perceive. To me it's basically just survive and be happy while remaining a decent person in the most optimal way you can. I hope people who are stuck in my previous situation come to a similar realization."

I talked about my experience on this in the context of fighting in GayLubeOil's violence thread but it goes wider than that. 

I actually remember your user name and past comments and my immediate, instinctive reaction upon your declaration of your gender (which surprised me) was changing my opinion of everything you've ever written and worrying about how offended you'd feel... as if you couldn't handle offense.

professor__doom,MechanicAdvice,1391072407.0,"Yeah, but then you lose the whole ""so easy to fix a 13-year-old could do it"" aspect of it.  And in terms of reliability, I know guys with old smallblocks pushing 350k miles--and those are HARD miles.  The 350 was good for like 175hp with the 4-barrel and probably over 200 with fuel injection, all with a nice flat torque curve (which a high-reving DOHC motor could only dream about).  The TBI 4.3 only had 145-160hp depending on configuration, but gobs and gobs of low-end torque, which is what matters in traffic (and subsequent intake/injection setups which will bolt to a 4.3 block were rated at 200 hp)

Vortec heads off a newer truck are a pretty obvious bolt-on upgrade for more efficiency and power, especially if you swap cams to go with it.  You don't even have to pull the motor!  Replacing the 4-barrel with a TBI (not sure if an '88 would still be a carb engine, or if they had moved to TBI already that year) is likewise a super simple junkyard mod for getting modern performance out of the old block.

Remember, the 350 block and rotating assembly was offered in GM vehicles until like 2005, and the 4.3 smallblock derivative just ended production last year!

They did an awesome job of modernizing the upper end of the motor to keep pace with technology and deliver modern performance and fuel economy, while applying the old ""don't mess with success"" formula to the block and rotating assembly."

So one shouldn't kill animals, or purchase their flesh, or express the desire that one should be provided with their flesh to consume, or so forth.

That is not the same thing as consuming flesh, as there are circumstances and contexts in which the flesh of an animal might be given willingly (cannibalistic fetishism perhaps) or the animal might die through no cause of your own. Roadkill is an example, in this case. The animal is dead, your consuming it will not cause more animals to die (well, maybe not, you'd need to consider quite a bit about it), and if left it might simply rot or even draw more animals to a hazardous place for their lives.

When given beef stew voluntarily, eat beef stew. Do not ask for it, do not support the economic industry around the slaughter of cattle, but you do not need to waste the product of that life as doing so will not stop the cow from having been killed.

The only thing I can compare it to is when I was in college I tried to learn to type on the Dvorak keyboard layout instead of the typical QWERTY setup.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard

I switched it on my computer and pasted a printout on the wall of the Dvorak keyboard and I actually got pretty good at it.

But for a while in the middle, I couldn't type either way very well! Sort of not at all!

It kind of panicked me since even so many years ago I had to write papers in college and do emails and talk on IM and stuff. But I had become the keyboard equivalent of mute!

After a little while longer I became ""bilingual"" and could go back and forth.

But I never stuck with Dvorak because although it's easier on the fingers, it's impractical if you ever use other computers than your own."

professor__doom,MechanicAdvice,1391074076.0,"As to fuel economy being worthwhile, here's some numbers:

The EPA gives 20mpg combined cycle for the '88 Caprice with 4.3.  In comparison, a 2009 Camry is rated at 26 combined with the 155hp 4-cyl.  Similar HP numbers, but the 4.3 has 40 more lb-ft of torque, and the torque is much lower in the RPM range, which is a huge advantage in real-life driving.

The Camry is a much smaller and lighter car than the caprice too, not to mention the Camry has an extra transmission gear to work with. I'd say the advantages of a ""modern"" 4-cyl over an ""ancient"" smallblock are overstated here--swap the Camry motor into the Caprice and you get optimistically, 23mpg versus 20?  And with a huge torque penalty.

The auto industry is working pretty hard to sell you on the idea that newer engine technologies are ""revolutionary"" and ""groundbreaking."" It certainly helps them sell new cars and keep their wallets full. In reality, they're incremental improvements at best.

We're made to think that it's different in such a way that people need special therapy and support just to deal with it. Fact is that there's nothing special about it. You're gay or you're straight and who the fuck cares.

1. From what I've seen, the portrayal of gay people now focuses more on the 'we're normal, just like you (except we like to have romantic/sexual relationships with people of the same sex)' than protraying us as something abnormal.

2. Queer people are abnormal (in the neutral sense of the word). We're fucking with the estabilished gender roles and couple dynamics.

3. People (most of the time) don't need therapy for being non-heterosexual (although support probably doesn't hurt). However, some might need therapy/support for how to deal with what other people are throwing their way (be it bullying, harmful portrayals in media...)."

I'm still not sure how you can justify how the Lions perform badly in the Six Nations because they have to go 2 years without a long summer break. Like I said, rugby players have a max of around 25 games a year, compared to 82-110 in the NHL, a sport that is harder hitting and much more gruelling than rugby could ever be.

My brother wasn't the most academic of people in high-school (he's very intelligent, but he wasn't academic), but he really wanted to go to uni because he felt like he didn't have any other options.  I was the only person in the world who tried to tell him he didn't have to go (I'd been there for two years at that point).  But he was adamant that he didn't want to be a deadbeat or a dropkick.  That idea had been drilled into him.

Anyway, he didn't quite get the marks needed to go to Uni, but he was able to do a six-month preparation course.  And this was really retard-level stuff, kind of insulting work you have to do really.  But he worked his ass off anyway, even though it was easy.

About a year or two into his degree proper, he really started picking up steam.  Working hard; way harder than I ever did.  He ended up graduating his B.Sc in Forensic Chemistry with honours, before going on to do his Masters Thesis.  He did all that before I managed to graduate with a BE.

LontraFelina,AskReddit,1391075148.0,"That's not how privilege works. Privilege does not say men have privilege, therefore *every single man who has ever lived* has had a better life than every single woman who has ever lived. It means that if two people have otherwise exactly equal lives but one is disadvantaged that person will, *most of the time*, be at least a little bit worse off. Imagine you have been a male RN for 30 years, have heard many sexist jokes against men, been sexually harassed, and even been behind the curve of promotions and raises, and on top of all that you're mocked, belittled and disowned for having a boyfriend who you're not legally allowed to marry. Yes there are plenty of gay people who have better lives than you do, but overall being gay is generally going to disadvantage you at least a bit.

And it is important to note that privilege isn't a hard and fast rule. As you've experienced, there are ways in which men are discriminated against too, and that is absolutely not okay. Anyone who gets caught up in the ridiculous Oppression Olympics and says that ""waaah, men have it so good, they don't deserve nice things"" is a moron. You've encountered one of these problems yourself - there are some careers in which men are disadvantaged because of bullshit societal misconceptions. It's about very general trends over a population, not the specific details of an individuals life, and people who try to use the concept of privilege on a personal level (such as the infamous ""shut up you're a man get out of here with your filthy male privilege"" idea) is a moron."

I know for a fact that people who look like they've got it all together on the outside have their own internal issues. I guess in that regard I was pretty similar to Haruki in high school as well. So I'd have to disagree with your conclusion that it's as if he didn't have a character before the show started.

Anyways, you have a very specific request so I can't really give you any suggestions that hit your criteria. The two most 'realistic' takes on romance I've watched are as follows: Honey &amp; Clover deals with mature themes like unrequited love and has college-aged characters, but there isn't really that much relationship progression for much of the show. I don't think you'd like it. Nodame Cantabile is about two college (and beyond) musical prodigies, and the music often serves as an allegory for their romance and personal struggles. This satisfies even less of your criteria, though, and unless you're a fan of classical music you would probably like it less. Both are well-written shows though, and Nodame in particular does a great job elaborating on the relationship (though it wasn't particularly physical, that seems like a really arbitrary marking of 'maturity' so I'm just going to ignore that request)."

mundabit,ABraThatFits,1391075257.0,"That's a good point about measuring the band itself rather than taking the lable as gospel. The freya is 42"" with no need to stretch it (the elastic is totally dead) while the Lara is 41"" stretched fully. And thanks for explaining size conversion. I was confused because my freya says ""AU/NZ:16G, UK:38H, US:38I; FR:100K"" on the tag. But that means the Freya is a 38G.

So calculating with my snug measurement I get a diffrence of 9"", a G cup, with a band that measures 38"" because I like them tight. That might end up being a 36H due to the elasticity of the band requiring me to go down a labelled size. all of this explains why the Lara feels more sportive but the Freya sits better in the Cup.

I don't mind a bit of gaping in my cup as long as I am getting some support from the bottom. I know my breasts are normal and they are attractive (My partner reminds me everyday) but as their owner I am inclined to spot the flaws, and I just feel more confident if I have a bra that makes them look the way I want them to look.

Some men are actually nice to all people, not because they want sex or want something, but because they are actually nice to *everyone*, not just women, yet they always get turned down for people who aren't nice. 

Is this the women's fault for turning him down? No way, a women is allowed to choose who she wants, and to be fair, it's perfectly logical to judge the few based on the many, see as the many in this case act just like the few.

I don't think you should assume a guy wants sex but remember that it is the norm for guys to assume a woman doesn't even like sex. They may not consciously realise that this is how they think, but seriously, that's one of the main limiting beliefs for asking someone out if you're male.

&gt; just wait til he makes the first move because it's safer

No offense but that seems pretty damn cowardly to me. Considering that men have exactly the same things running through their head and more. Fear of rejection is just as bad from the male side as well, except WE don't get compliments and support when we fail. WE get told we're creepy or have our insecurities thrown into our faces when we get rejected, even for just saying hi. The men who are confident enough to reject you will almost definitely be nice about it because they've been through about 10 million painful, humiliating rejections.

I know I sound a bit bitter there but I'm not actually. I personally like the way things are because it gives me a challenge to overcome. But don't give the fear of rejection excuse, it's bullshit. It's very powerful and very real bullshit that takes a lot of effort to overcome, but it's bullshit all the same.

silverionmox,europe,1391075906.0,"&gt;If you go too far, and you do this too fast, without other countries following your lead, you'll simply price yourself out of the market. Furthermore, as government backed subsidies towards energy decrease you're competitiveness, governments may look to subsidizing manufacturing industries as well to offset the losses.
In the end, all that will be accomplished is the massive theft of the tax payers money, with all of that cash being thrown into the abyss of increasingly uncompetitive energy/manufacturing companies.

Consider this:

- http://solarbusiness.com.au/energy-costs-shift-solar-externalities-and-subsidies/
&gt;“Despite its increase since 2008, (cumulative) support for renewables (around 54 billion euros) falls far short of the state subsidies for the electricity sector from 1970 –2012, with lignite coming in at 65 billion, hard coal at 177 billion, and nuclear at 187 billion.”.

- http://nexus.som.yale.edu/qn/sites/default/files/Energy%20Graph%202g.jpg
&gt;On an inflation-adjusted basis, we learned, the subsidies for ""traditional"" energy sources in their early growth days—coal, oil, gas, and nuclear—were many, many times what we are spending on renewables today.

- http://cleantechnica.com/2011/06/20/wind-power-subsidies-dont-compare-to-fossil-fuel-nuclear-subsidies/
&gt;Without subsidies, electricity prices would be:
Wind Power: 6-7 cents/kWh
Nuclear Power: 11-20+ cents/kWh
Coal Power: 9-32+ cents/kWh

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_subsidies 
&gt;Fossil fuel subsidies reached $90 billion in the OECD and over $500 billion globally in 2011.[1] Renewable energy subsidies reached $88 billion in 2011

- http://www.euractiv.com/energy/oettinger-scared-fossil-fuel-sub-analysis-531291 
&gt;Interestingly, these proportions match those from 2001 when, according to a European Environment Agency (EEA) study, renewables received 19% of all energy subsidies while fossil fuels and nuclear got 81%. More unexpected is that they also match ratios for the 1990 to 1995 period, where the EEA again found that 74% of energy subsidies in Europe benefitted fossil fuels and nuclear, while renewables only received 7% of the total. This shows us that for decades energy subsidies have strongly favoured fossil fuels and nuclear power and continue to do so.
&gt;
&gt;On this basis, total energy subsidies in the EU in 2011 amount to €26 billion for fossil fuels (+ €40 billion for related health costs), €35 billion for nuclear power, and €30 billion for renewables. This means that out of a total of €131 billion, renewables which are still in need of support to enter the market get a 23% share – whilst mature, unsustainable and old-fashioned energies get a huge 77% slice of the energy subsidy cake.
&gt;
&gt;Research done by the think tank FÖS shows that for the period 1970-2012, cumulative state subsidies for hard coal and lignite in Germany reach a staggering €398 billion, followed by €213 billion for nuclear energy.

Energy subsidies do increase competitiveness, because you get a multiplier effect through technology, increasing productivity. The question remains which energy sources we should subsidize. Entrenched interests and costs that already have been paid in the past and costs that are externalized to the present or the future should also be taken into account."

TheLittleGoodWolf,childfree,1391075925.0,"Holy shitckrackers!

I don't even know what to say so I'll revert to my usual: producing children is a privilege and not a right. Well I don't think it's a privilege either but you get my drift I hope.

If she can't afford a surrogate she's ill equipped to care for a child, if she can't even care for a dog then another human being is out of the question. Adoption, there is always a way, even if it's a lot of work.

I can understand her being a little upset that her sister wouldn't want to be a surrogate. I mean it's completely irrational of her but such is the deal with emotions sadly. Still, you don't ask a girl who just graduated high-school to basically ruin her body on the whim of her sister. This is not like needing a kidney or something for god's sake.

I would consider cutting all contact with the sister."
bubbish,AskMen,1391075929.0,"I hesitated before writing that last paragraph but I did anyway, and now I sort of regret it. I'd hate to cause you to have false hopes. I'm just a dude on the internet. I've never seen you two together so don't pin too much on my opinion!

Don't wait for her to make a move. If you have the sort of dynamic you describe you should be able to have a sit-down and talk things through. If she does have feelings for you, despite everything, you can't do more than hope that she has the guts to tell you about them. That being said, I don't think that happens very often outside of movies so be careful of having expectations here that are too high.

In the end, this is about you striking a balance between your relationship with this girl, and your own emotional well-being. I think you should be very clear about this with her. I think you would very much love to continue being friends but not at the cost of your own happiness. And then there's the risk of what might happen if you keep repressing your feelings. I'll explain, but bear with me here.

I had a friend whom I developed feelings for. She had a boyfriend at the time so I accepted defeat and tried to push down my feelings. It did work, for about two years. By this time, she was single but we were so used to being platonic and I was really fearing what would happen if I let those old feelings come rushing back, so I kept holding them down. That was when the resentment started creeping in.  I didn't realize this at the time, but I was holding her to a higher standard than my other friends because like you, I valued the dynamic between us. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I was disappointed that she didn't show that she wanted to explore the possibility of being more than friends. I didn't actually do much to show her the same in an overt manner, so it wasn't really fair to her. 

The result of all this was that I became more sensitive to stuff she did, that normal friends do all the time - like not calling me for a little while because she was busy with her own shit. I became more prone to feeling betrayed by her. Of course, I was younger and stupid so I didn't talk to her about any of this. Not none. She probably knew I felt something for her but she was like me full of pride and insecurity so she didn't do anything either.

And that's what kills me. Today, I don't have this friend anymore. She's alive and well and we have mutual friends, but we both pretend like the other doesn't exist. I let myself feel powerless and consequently resentful about our situation, and that drove a wedge between us. A wedge that only I could see. It must've been quite confusing for her, even though I today still hold that she wasn't entirely faultless - she could've done more when she noticed I was drifting away from her. In the end, she said something mean to me which wasn't a big deal at all, but I used it as an excuse to distance myself further and decided not to talk to her for a few weeks. She didn't make any effort to contact me back, which I took as another betrayal and that was it. We haven't had an honest conversation since then.

You have already taken an important step with your friend, that I didn't take with mine. She knows you have feelings for her. In my small experience with girls, I've noticed that even though someone might reject you, the fact that you put yourself out there and showed that you like someone signals that you are strong and valuable. In some cases, that alone might be enough to turn them around. I find that this holds true for romantic feelings as well as random hookups at a bar. 

That is why I wrote that last paragraph. I think it's definitely worth it to probe her for signs that she might've come around for you. If probing doesn't work, you have to put yourself at ease and ask her in earnest. I feel that this is what you should do, because of my own experience. But remember that that was just my version of this shitty situation. Take it at face value. Take it as a possible outcome of your own circumstances. Don't do anything you might regret because some guy on the internet thought he was wise (I am wis*er* nowadays but I'm still young, I don't pretend I know enough to guide someone else).

Phew, that became a lot longer than I anticipated. Guess your story really struck a chord with me. Whatever you do, I wish you the best of luck and I'd like to remind you one last time to always look out for your own well-being firsthand."

**tl;dr** The Job Centre, although they tried, couldn't help me at all. And actively stopped me from seeking manual work.

&gt; The Job Centre is simply not equipped to be deal with educated, experienced and qualified 'candidates'

I'll second that. I've got a degree in Computer Science and a year (or so) after graduating, I was unemployed. So, I headed down to the Job Centre to sign on simply so that I would appear on someone's books for tax purposes. I was fully aware that they wouldn't be able to help me get a job in my chosen profession, and was open to taking any work at the time.

At my first consultation/meeting/appointment/whatever, I told the lady this. She seemed incensed that I would be willing to take a job that was beneath me, and ""for someone else"". Fair enough, I said then asked how the Job Centre could help me. ""We can help you with getting to interviews and try, help you find a job in the area and offer you training courses.""

Ok, what kind of courses. ""Well, we have basic numeracy and literacy. Those are the big ones."" I told her that I wasn't trying to be funny, be I figured that my taking those courses would be a waste of my time, the teacher's time and I would take a spot that would be better served giving to someone else. ""Not to worry.""

A few weeks later, I was assigned to a different person. This guy seemed like he could help me out a little more.

""Well, we have nothing on the books in IT..."" I interrupted him (it was intended as politely) and told him the software development is completely different from IT. ""Fair enough, have you tried signing up for graduate job search sites?"" I had. ""Have you checked the job site page on The Guardian?"" Yup. ""Well, I can't really advise you any more than that."" That's fair enough. I'm trying my hardest to get out of this unemployment thing myself, and I appreciate your time and help with that.

I'd started looking into developing some software in my own time at this point, and would bring a book with me to my appointments (they would always be late) and would sit in the waiting area reading ""Physics Engines for Games Development"" or ""OpenGL &lt;something or other&gt;"" while I waited. I probably looked like a complete twat, but I needed something to do while I waited, and researching my next steps felt like a good idea.

I finally got an interview with a successful games dev company (I wont say who, but I'll give you some clues: they made the Micro Machines games back in the day), through my own perseverance. I went into the Job Centre that day and explained to the helpful clerk that I would need to see someone about getting help with travel expenses for an interview. He lit up, then guided me to a lady who talked me through the process.

When I explained that the interview was in Warwickshire the lady visibly deflated. She told me that I would get help, no problem. But I'd have to wait and she wandered off to speak to someone. About half an hour later, she produced a form that I had to show to the gents at the train station. ""They'll organise everything,"" she told me.

I spent another six months using their waiting room as a study room. I finally found myself employment and felt great joy in walking into the Job Centre to tell them. The lady I told was genuinely happy for me.

I was on their books for a year. At one point, I was told that my allowance would stop if I didn't attend the numeracy courses. Even when I pointed out that I had a degree in a mathematical subject. I never had to take their courses, and I feel glad about that. Not because I would have been bored to tears, but because I would have been taking a space that someone else, someone who needed it, could have taken.

There's another set of options where you can choose which bars you cycle through by tapping R1 - and you can have two different sets of cycles if you want for weapon drawn or sheathed.

So, as an example, when my weapon is out I can only cycle between two Crossbars, and these are my class-specific ones.  One has my skills and various macros, the other has Chocobo control and potions/food.  I *can't* cycle to to Bar 3, but this bar does open as my expanded Bar.  That way I'm never, ever, more than one click away from anything in the heat of combat.

With my weapon sheathed, I can tap R1 to go between my ""Utility"" bar (Inventory, Armoury, Mounts, Logs etc) and my ""Class"" bar which has all my gear sets on it.  I can manually go to another bar with custom emotes, HUD controls, and minions and other aesthetic stuff.  These bars are shared across all classes.  Tapping R3 cycles me between class-specific combat bars and all-class utility bars.

She is my ""one that got away"" simply because she treated me like a king. To this day, she's the only breakup I would describe as 'blameless'.

For WvW you will probably want a Hammer / Staff and possibly a GS. The stats will depend on the role you are filling, but I would get Soldier’s stats and if you need more damage, you can use your PVE weapons.

S/D works well in small scale WvW, but it becomes significantly less powerful in larger scale engagements. It has unreliable AoE abilities and weak auto-attacks compared to D/D or Staff. Staff is the standard choice for larger scale WvW, normally.

S/D is really good at dealing burst-y damage really quickly, though. If you enjoy smaller scale WvW and like to burst people down quickly, go for it. Also, S/D builds usually have either 20 in Air or 30 in Air. Here are 2 super quick example builds for you.

(I feel these should be higher on the list, but I placed then last because they're long and popular shows, and that means the importance in viewership is diminished a bit, they're both done shows, so you can watch then before you die, and still be good) (Edit: Boondocks might be current, not 100% sure)

* [**Psych**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491738/) **8/10** (It's the only sitcom that I'd strongly recommend)

* [**Star Gate**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2593868/) **9/10** (if you don't want to watch 20 seasons of a single show, just watch [**SG: Atlantis**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374455/) **7/10**) (its on Netflix)

* [**Seinfeld**](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) **10/10** (Seinfeld himself has confirmed what Woody has said, the show was a fluke, if they didn't have the cast they did, the show might have never made it. **But** it did make it, they did have the perfect cast for the show, and we have it available for us to watch. It makes 0 sense discredit them, just because the show might have failed otherwise.)

Euryleia,Guildwars2,1391077376.0,"&gt; The other races all feel somewhat restricted in their profession choices by the lore.

Not really.  The issue is that people find stereotypes of their own group obviously silly, but find it all too easy to stereotype those who are different from themselves.  Thus, you don't stereotype humans the way you stereotype those other races, and the result is you feel this false sense of restriction.  If you actually pay attention to the lore, you would note that *all* of the examples you provided are attested to by the lore, providing in-lore reasons why such class combinations are often found.  The *lore* is not what's restricting your choices here, just your biases.

I can't even figure out where you're coming from with some of those.  Elementalism is an obvious natural fit for the Norn, and Sylvari are ridiculously curious about everything, especially the more unusual and foreign the things they are to them, and death definitely tops that list.  The lore goes out of its way on several occasions (both in books and in game dialog) to paint death as one of the most absolutely fascinating topics for Sylvari.  But given their curiosity about everything in general, *any* profession restrictions on them would be at extreme odds with the lore.  There's nothing they wouldn't study with a passion.  You can make far better cases for profession restrictions among humans than among sylvari..."

I understand there is a difference between attraction and acting on it, and I think that is honestly the answer to your question. But what got me is there were people on that post seriously defending child molesters and CP ""as long as it's consensual"". (Most of *those* people have since deleted their comments though.) Stuff like that, I have no answer for.

A lot of people want to treat pedophilia as if it were an orientation, but the fact is it can *never* be normal. It will *never* be acceptable because **the people you're attracted to can't consent**. Go get counseling. Go get help. Chemical castration, whatever. But don't be a teacher.

* [Boys Clubs](http://100percentmen.tumblr.com/) (fairly simple and straight-forward. Lists and calls out important agencies, companies, boards of directors, government cabinets, etc, that are all male...reminder of the glass ceiling, how womens' voices are silenced in a lot of ways) 

* [How To Be A Fan of Problematic Things](http://www.socialjusticeleague.net/2011/09/how-to-be-a-fan-of-problematic-things/). One of my absolute favorites of all times. I love video games/sci-fi/movies and a lot of them are so awful in terms of race/gender relations that it's hard for me to justify loving them so much. Definitely meaty, and personally, it really made me think. 

* [Bechdel Test](http://bechdeltest.com/) If you haven't heard of it, it's a very simple test for movies/pop culture. To pass the test, the movie/book/comic/whatever has to have at least two (named) female characters, who talk to each other, at least once, about something BESIDES a man. This one really broke my heart when I realized how many of my favorite movies and books (LotR, anyone?) didn't even come CLOSE to passing the test. Check out the site and the list, it really opened my eyes, personally. [more Bechdel test stuff, in graphics on Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1hn1l3/ten_graphics_on_the_bechdel_test_oc/)

* [Why Yellow Fever Is Different than ""Having  A Type""](http://www.thebolditalic.com/articles/3180-why-yellow-fever-is-different-than-having-a-type-) a good picture of intersectionality, a big feminist concept. Talks about how (usually white) men will fetishize Asian women based on how they think women and especially women of Asian descent are supposed to/should/will behave. Short and to the point. 

*[Repair Her Armor](http://repair-her-armor.tumblr.com/) slightly more light-hearted than some of the other links. Takes ridiculous women's armor in popular media and makes it actually functional; addresses a lot of the ways women are seen as sexy vixens in a chain-mail bikini and not an actual warrior champion. 

These are just some of my personal favorites and random links that I had bookmarked on my own. Most of them deal with visual culture, but I feel that impacts modern society very deeply, and that a lot of society's gender issues are really obvious in a visual sense. I hope you enjoy them as well.

In my opinion it's better to have a somewhat civil, mutual end to the relationship.

The lowest bidder is the lowest for a reason; they're going to put in as little effort as possible. Because they're putting in as little effort as possible, they take the largest demographic and make assumptions. Those assumptions are:

 * Hasn't got a job
 * Probably never has had a job
 * Assume no qualifications, which leads to:
 * Assume bad literacy and numeracy
 * Assume no experience with computer equipment or software because (another assumption) too poor or old or scared to buy one.

Which all leads to the same thing:

 * ~10% of the people who take the course find it intriguing and useful
 * 25% of the rest are the remaining target audience but take no part
 * 65% of the rest have their intelligence insulted by the level of the course

""Cost,"" of course, has several (occasionally conflicting) definitions in the context of these issues.

Negging isn't really necessary unless you're in bars and clubs, approaching the hottest of the hot women, and they're being rude or dismissive of you because they assume you have low social value.  

&gt; The example is this: I have a female friend who is probably a 6-7/10. I understand there is no exception to the rule, and I know this to be true as she has had a promiscuous past, but my attraction to her is really from her quirkiness and lively personality.  

Fuck the haters.  If you like her and want to pursue her, more power to 'ya.  You don't need anybody else's approval to do so.  

-------------------------------  

You know what I'm not seeing you describe here?  

Touch and sexual potential.  

First, touch.  Touch her early.  Touch her often.  Don't grope her, obviously.  Mix up the subtle and the obvious.  For the subtle, lightly touch her back or shoulder every time you make a point or she makes a point.  For the obvious, pick her up and twirl her around or tickle her or hug her or massage her hands just because.  

Second, sexual potential.  Good Lord, there's a lot to cover there.  

Here's a quick outline of the stuff you need to cover to bridge the gap between ""social"" and ""sexual"":  

* Sensual Eye Contact  
* Silence and Pauses  
* Sexual tone of voice  
* Physical proximity  
* Intimate Touch  
* Your sexual state (imagine how you interacted with your last lover in the bedroom before sex, then project that emotional state outwards towards her)  

Note that you will probably fuck this up.  Don't worry, that's natural.  Instead of focusing on this one person, go out and meet (and sleep with) lots of new women so that it won't be as big if this option falls through."

GaProgMan,britishproblems,1391079171.0,"Precisely this. Any part of education (and the big thing that the Job Centre is education on ways to get back into work - effectiveness not withstanding), is to ensure that everyone has a base level of knowledge.

Whenever a student, regardless of age, takes a course, regardless of content, the teacher must either make assumptions on the students prior knowledge or teach them the things they need to know to understand what is to come next.

As an example, I took a Computer Science degree. The first few lectures in my first year were on bits, bytes, hardware architecture and formal logic (all are the very basics of Computer Science or programming). Because the lecturers needed to know that we all have the basics nailed down completely.

Would the average Joe be willing to take a course on the Experimental Quantum Physics of black holes without knowing what any of those words meant, or the basics of Physics, Quantum Physics and black holes? Probably not.

That's precisely what the Job Centre are doing when they send everyone off to a C.V building class, or a numeracy class, or a literacy class. I agree that there should be selection criteria, but that would mean that every new applicant would have to be tested. Testing every single applicant would take time and money, and the JC are after doing things as cheaply as possible.

Is it a waste of some folks' time? Probably. Is it a perfect system? Probably not. Do they have the resources to impediment testing? Probably not. Would it make it easy for folks who are on JSA? Probably not, because they'd have to wait longer to see their advisors, and what's to stop folks from cheating? Also, what do you do with the folks who pass the test?"

You could state, for any paradox: ""Can an omnipotent being solve this paradox?"" In this sense, the mere existence of paradoxes make omnipotence a paradox itself. But only for the least interesting definition of ""omnipotence"". 

Considering omnipotence to mean ""able to do anything that is logically consistent"" is far more interesting. This definition also has logical problems, but it's not as trivial. "

A common occurrence with Alphas in nonmonogamous relationships where a woman leaves the Alpha, who will not give her monogamy, so she can get a traditional boyfriend or husband who will. The new boyfriend/husband is always an AFC, beta, or Alpha Male 1.0, who eventually either bores her to death, irritates her with too many rules, or cheats on her. The woman then leaves the boyfriend/husband and goes right back to the Alpha, resuming the sexual relationship. LSNFTEs last anywhere from a few weeks to many years.

When we finally started talking and becoming friends, I determined to learn how to play any song I wanted by ear and impress her that way so I could make her my girlfriend.

I left school for a little bit. I finally got down the song ""Wedding Dress"" while I was away.

My best friend called me in the middle of a runthrough of the song, and he told me to check Facebook.

The girl of my dreams got a boyfriend.

My weak teenage heart was crushed. Devastated. I couldn't gather the strength to talk to anyone or move anywhere. All I could do was keep playing the piano and lose myself in the music.

But you know what? My world didn't end. Life still went on, despite me not being able to have this girl. And I acquired a pretty badass skill that I knew I could keep developing...for my enjoyment.

I still play ""Wedding Dress"" to remind me of this - no matter what relationships go to shit, no matter what failures I encounter, life goes on, and I just need to keep moving forward instead of dwelling on the things that could have been."

pretzelzetzel,AskReddit,1391081365.0,"I believe strongly in Western Exceptionalism. I thought it was pretty obvious that European societies had some special element which allowed them to so very strongly dominate the whole rest of the world in every way forever, but this notion is unpopular among professional historians, because it seems to paint other cultures as inferior.

This brings me to my second point: some cultures are just superior to others. Individual humans who hail from different cultures can equally equally good or bad, independent of culture, but the cultures themselves can pretty easily be ranked. Your folks invented cars, airplanes, vaccines, and landed on the moon? Advanced. Your folks burn witches, now, in 2014? Your folks rape babies as a cure for AIDS? Backward. Not advanced. Shitty. Sorry, but that's the way it is. The refusal to state that a culture sucks, for fear of offending someone, is spineless and odious.

This brings me to my third point: in a free society, nobody has the right not to be offended. Don't like an opinion? Don't listen. People worry too much about the feely-weelies of those they talk about and they wind up avoiding saying things they should be saying, like ""Islam fucking sucks"" and ""China is a shitty fucking country""."

mindovermacabre,Borderlands,1391081500.0,"Gaige is my favorite character to play!

For Normal, it's all about experimenting and having fun, no pressure.  Gaige is best known for her anarchy skill, a skill that increases gun damage while decreasing accuracy, used in a 'stack' basis that each 'stack' (gained when you kill an enemy or automatically reload a weapon after emptying the clip) increases/decreases the damage/accuracy percentages.  There are some great tips that helped already, but what i found to work the absolute best with an anarchy-build Gaige is the jakobs coach shotguns.  Usually only one or two shots per mag, meaning that you're constantly reloading and constantly increasing anarchy stacks.  The one shot mags go even further for her and prevent you from accidentally reloading (something that causes you to lose all stacks of anarchy) while increasing anarchy at an even greater rate.  Coach guns are your friend.  I don't think I used any other weapon throughout all of TVHM.

With Anarchy, Close Enough, Preshrunk Cyberpunk, Discord, Rational Anarchist, and Typecast Iconolast are your best friends.  I've heard of wonky mechanics about the Nth Degree, but I still spec into it because I still feel like it helps.  Close enough makes your bullets ricochet so more of them hit.  Preshrunk Cyberpunk increases your Anarchy cap so you can have more and do more damage.  Discord prevents accidental reloading by letting you reload again and preserve anarchy (along with some great survival bonuses if you want to use it- works good in conjunction with Rational Anarchist).  Rational Anarchist starts you off with 25 stacks instead of 1, Typecast gives you an increased rate to get 2 stacks instead of 1.

Other skills in Ordered Chaos: Blood Soaked Shields is, in my opinion, Gaige's best skill.  It allows you to regenerate your shields at the cost of a little health upon every kill.  This works *magic* with Nova Shields and Amp Shields, allowing you to strategically turn your shield into a permanent weapon of its own.

Other Skills in general: Cooking Up Trouble gives good survivability and helps when used in conjunction with Discord for health gating (something you won't have to worry about until UVHM, but it's still saved my ass in normal and TVHM).  Sharing is caring allows DT to have your shield offense as well- though he won't get the blood soaked shields along with it, so it's not as offensive as your shield. :(  Over in LBT, you've got Shock and AAAGH which deals electrical damage each time you reload (think back to those Coach guns and constant reloading- this means that your gaps of 'no damage' while reloading are filled with electrical explosions, though only useful if you play Gaige close range).  I find Electrical burn fun, as it applies fire damage and shock damage simultaneously, and few enemies resist both.  Interspersed Outburst is especially useful, as it generally slags enemies on the first shot of each clip while in a firefight, causing you do do increased slag damage without switching weapons or even needing slag weapons.

As for gear, some people like SMGs, but I find that if you're looking for normal playthroughs with non-unique weapons, shotties are the way to go.  Avoid anything that has a large clip size, sniper rifles, and launchers (unless you know what you're doing, of course!)

Shields, someone else mentioned upthread that Nova shields are good.  I'm a fan of Novas, but nothing does damage output like Amp shields used in conjunction with Blood Soaked Shields.  Amp shields aren't as effective with shotguns (the damage is divided by the pellet count listed on the card), but I found that throughout normal and a good portion of TVHM, I was able to shoot an amp shot, which lowered my shields, which generally killed the enemy, which popped my shields back up and let me fire another amp shot right away.  Like a poor man's Bee.

There's more, but I feel like I've rambled for an eternity.  TL;DR HAVE FUN WITH HER and don't be afraid to get a little crazy. :)"

existie,birthcontrol,1391081591.0,"I've had mine for a couple years now, and my experience has been fine as well.

Insertion was ouchy but not the end of the world (even for me, and I have a pretty low tolerance for pain and have never had bad cramps). Cramps and bleeding were way worse for about a year, which puts me still less severe than a lot of girls deal with. I got weird twinges periodically for the first year as well. I could have sex carefully after a week (cervix was super sore).

Now, my period is back to mostly normal (a vague sense of nausea and mild cramping at worst), and although the flow is fairly heavy, it doesn't bother me.

Although I'd love to be sterilized, I'm absolutely happy with my Paragard. I prefer it over hormonal methods, which I can't use anyway due to high blood pressure. I'll be happy to continue having a Paragard until I can afford sterilization."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1391081668.0,"While I understand the attraction of spontaneity, and how romantic and sexy it can be, it is NO place to have this conversation, you are right about that. The moment passion can completely occur, but AFTER the conversation has happened.

It should happen way before that moment. 

If it feels like there is chemistry, or could be chemistry, or either party *wants there* to be sexual activity, then, over food, or while walking around, on a date, through online messaging, or in whatever setting other conversations happen in, say, ""I'm really attracted to you. Can we talk about our sexual expectations and preferences?""

If they say no, or that they aren't ready yet (totally possible to bring this up too early, or for the person to be surprised by the request), and such a moment of spontaneity occurs, then, yeah, I think you gotta cockblock yourself.  

Too much pressure and excitement to carry a clear headed discussion about:

* these are the kinds of protection I use and expect us to use for STIs, here's what I use for birth control
* this is what I like
* this is what you may never ever do
* if I say ""NO"" I fucking mean it and you back the fuck off for X amount of time
* or I enjoy consensual non consent and like to say ""NO""when I do NOT mean it. If you are comfortable doing that with me I'll use these safewords X, Y, Z in place of ""NO"" and here's how I'll need you to respond to them 
* I am orgasmic and here's easy ways I cum 
* or I am inorgasmic. I really like this, please do it but don't be sad if I can't cum, I promise I love every second of it
* I love to have good sex, but romantically it's casual for me and I don't want it to lead to a relationship
* or I don't have sex outside of LTRs
* I won't have PIV sex before marriage
* I won't have any sexual contact before marriage

This conversation is worth the initial cockblock, should that happen. *""I'm sorry, I need us to talk about our sexual expectations and desires and protection before we have sex. I didn't bring it up earlier, because I didn't think we were quite there yet.*

More comfortable sex makes for better sex. WAY better.

Already knowing what your partner likes and dislikes means you don't have to try random things until you *think* you find a genuine reaction.

It opens up communication so that you have the option of saying what *you* need to say in the future without worrying you might ruin things.

Inexperienced people who don't know the answers to many of these things I mentioned still need to talk about safer sex, and hard limits they can think of, and a safeword of some kind so they have it if they need it.

Someone who can't, or won't, have this conversation, IMO, shouldn't be having sex. It's the responsible thing to do.

I think people that have good sex, without incidents, and without ever talking about these things just get lucky. I really believe that, without these conversations, it's just a matter of time until someone feels pressure to do something they aren't comfortable with, have never been comfortable with, and don't know how to say ""NO"" in a way the other person will understand.

*edit:* 
*These kinds of conversations can become sexy themselves, after practicalities like protection are out of the way, and you share your fantasies and desires*"

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1391082070.0,"Since my comment was downvoted, read it with full explanation now:

Assisted suicide has a very decent principle and as such should eventually be allowed. Simply because we can take our own lives if we want to (suicide) but can't if we don't have controls over our body.

The same principle came with the idea of abortion in UK. Of course it is good to have possibility for an abortion. The law is actually quite good about it. The issue is its implementation in the real life. You can go to a doctor and say ""I don't want to have that child"" and have an abortion. No reason to provide is necessary at many places (especially private clinics). That is why there are ""gender abortions"" (wanting girl/boy, not having it so an abortion) or as a form of contraceptive, where some people don't care they can get pregnant and even though no social, economical nor mental reasons exist they still go ahead with the abortion.

When I raised an issue I meant it would be risky to have assisted suicide implemented in UK (judging on abortion implementation) without having plenty of cases where such would be misused. For example, a family member deciding on behalf of that person, where in fact his sole reason is to get money or ""get rid"" of the unwanted burden."

To try and make it really short, I think the main point is that while it takes the issues it talks about very seriously, it doesn't take *itself* seriously.  It's happy to self-deprecate in the service of pointing to a bigger picture.

By that I mean it's dead serious about the danger of the nuclear age and the issues of Mutually Assured Destruction, but it's not so serious about the idea of a giant killer mech.  It's very serious about the trauma of war and the effects on humanity of PTSD, but recognises the humour of grown men and women obsessing over battle.  It's serious about the horror of child soldiers and humans being put through the grinder to be turned into living weapons for their entire lives, but still sees the inherent funny side of a dirty old man creeping around the battlefield.

I guess at the end of the day, MGS has a lot to say about political truths, but the idea of truths also carries through the to characters.  Underneath all the exaggeration these are still very real, relateable characters, and truth also lies at the heart of comedy.

Cybernetic Ninjas aren't exactly realistic, but the idea of an anime fan abruptly finding himself face-to-face with one is pretty funny, especially when there's truth to his reaction.

Gay man your age here. (does 21 count as a man? I guess so.)

I have several gay friends. One of them shares a very similar opinion to you. He wouldn't want to change being gay, but he says that he will probably never come out because people judge. He even went as far as to say he probably wouldn't even tell his family.

You say you are happy for people who come out and are genuinely happy. Do you wonder why that is? I can tell you this- most of them, before they came out, were not genuinely happy. So why are you happy, to see them going through what very possibly is one of the most stressful experiences in their lives?

Let me take a guess at why you feel this way. Success is about us, while happiness is about others. How do we bring others into our lives? It's a bit crass, but to get close to someone we essentially employ hostage tactics. Trained people will humanise themselves to create a basic connection with their captors. But in normal life, to connect with someone more intimately takes risk. And taking that risk for gay people is putting ourselves in an extremely vulnerable place.

I may still sound crazy, saying vulnerability is what leads to happiness. But artists face it all the time. We hear about it from content creators on YouTube. When talking about someone who has come out, people often say ""Wow, he must be very strong to acknowledge that side of himself"" or ""It sure took confidence for her to stand for herself"". But this is in my experience the opposite of the truth. I have never been weaker and less confident than when coming out to someone or a group of people. But the reason people see it as strength and confidence is because that experience *brings* those two things. When you say you've strongly disliked being yourself, I do not doubt it. There is such a thing as a healthy level of self criticism. But it's when you can step away from the mirror and interact with other people openly and honestly that you become able to face yourself better than you could in any mirror.

You're out on the road, feeling how icy it is. You're in your garage, looking at the dented bumper. You're not going to get anywhere without just getting your ass in the car and taking it for a spin.

Ok I'll give some more straightforward advice and then a few quotes and then I'll stop.

Please act however you want. When you say you're countering not liking who you are by trying to be something else, it worries me. I don't want to tell you how to act, but take a good look at the logic behind expecting to like yourself more by trying to be something you're not.

I don't think this is controversial, really. Everyone has struggles and everyone else wants to help them pull through. It'll work itself out, etc etc. Also, please stop hating it so much you haven't kissed anybody. Please kiss someone. Kiss me. Kiss your cat. I don't care, it's really fun and not at all gross like you think it is in middle school.

Pros of origami: Original, shows you care enough to spend time/effort (which is sweet), lasts longer than flowers

Cons: Doesnt have the tradition/convention to back it up, does take you a long time to make them. Presentation becomes very important.



Pros of real flowers: They smell nice. They're pretty much universally appreciated (barring allergies). Traditional. Less effort on your part.

Cons: Don't last very long, some people have allergies.

PixelOrange,casualiama,1391082527.0,"The ""only"" way to gain muscle is to exercise. Your diet affects how much energy your body has and how well it can build muscle (which requires protein to do) but calories are calories.

You shouldn't eat shitty food because it's bad for you but eating chicken from chik-fil-a is going to give you the same protein as chicken that you prepare yourself which means both will work. Should you eat clean? Yes, sure, but not because you want muscle gain. You should eat clean because you want to stay healthy and not cover those muscles with fat.

Also, CrossFit is really [controversial](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ken-reed/crossfit_b_4666040.html). It's not regulated by [ACE](http://www.acefitness.org/default.aspx) or [AFAA](http://www.afaa.com/).

codayus,TestPackPleaseIgnore,1391083006.0,"Out of curiosity, I decided to look at power use as well.  How much does it cost to smelt a single iron ore into an ingot?  Well...

* A Ender IO Alloy Smelter used 2000 RF
* An IC2 Electric Furnace used 1560 RF
* A TE Redstone Furnace used 1600 RF
* A Mekanism Energized Smelter used 6000 RF.

Or to put it another way, if you are burning charcoal using that mod's main charcoal-to-power block:

* Ender IO can smelt 8 iron ore per charcoal
* IC2 can smelt just over 10 iron ore per charcoal
* TE can smelt 15 iron ore per charcoal
* Mekanism can smelt 0.053 iron ore per charcoal.

That is to say, it takes almost 19 charcoal to smelt 1 iron ore.  Or to put it another way, the charcoal Mekanism uses to smelt 1 iron ore would smelt 281 iron ore with TE.

(For reference, a vanilla furnace will smelt 8 iron ore per charcoal.)

Additionally, I'm guessing age ranges on reddit are very skewed to the younger ages, and only having one or two people in one demographic set doesn't give you a lot of useful data. Firstly, that means its not really going to be half the reddit population. Secondly, if there was a 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70+ division, it would be unlikely (I guess) that you'd get more than one or two in the higher age brackets. Their issues and concerns then could very easily not be representative of all the women in that age group, so their input would possibly be discounted if things are being done by age. Therefore, grouping them together means that while they might differ, at least they can count more effectively than if they were separated out. 

I don't think anyone is saying you're old, just that statistically, you're older than most of the TwoX demographic. The two are not the same. "

I think at one point she may have asked me, through friends, whether I was up for dating, and at the time, I wasn't, for reasons that seem pretty silly now.

Years later, she came with friends to eat at the restaurant I worked at, and while I recognized her, I didn't make any attempt to really talk with her--we barely knew eachother, had nothing to talk about. My manager, though, was waiting their table, and said, ""Dude, I've found your soulmate."" Apparently this girl's style was so completely off-the-wall over-people's-heads-but-friendly that it reminded my manager of me, except female. 

Periodically I consider trying to get in contact with her. Not to date--I think that ship has sailed, though I do not mourn it--but if she's my sister's kind of person, and that manager saw something for me in her, then I think we could possibly be really good friends.

Scales, scales, scales. All scales, all the time. If you practice at the quieter dynamic then you will eventually master the quieter dynamic. I'm sure this isn't news to you, but it is advice and insight coming from someone who really knows their stuff.

I struggle with the same thing you do (I'm also a bari sax player who plays exclusively jazz these days in a couple jazz bands) in terms of dynamic control.

If you're playing TPPI, you'd *never* want to build a Heat Generator; even if you want to go down the Mekanism tech tree, the proper move is to start with TE, and use TE dynamos to power your metallurgic infusers.

Edit:  For reference, a wind turbine generates ~160 RF/tick at level 65.  And it doesn't actually require steel.  3 Osmium Ingots, 6 Enriched Alloy (Iron + Redstone in a Metallurgic Infuser), 6 gold, and some more redstone.  And the Infuser only needs iron, stone, redstone, and another osmium ingot.

...that's actually pretty amazing.  Since each one is about as good as two steam dynamos, that means nine of them will replace a standard 18 steam dynamo, 36 HP boiler, tree farm/biofuel setup.  Unless I futzed the math; I've been staring at this stuff a bit too long.  :)"

They're usually turn-based and pretty often only have character-based interface, though there's been modern games that use graphics and some have abandoned the turn-based aspect too. Diablo series basically evolved from roguelikes.

How about instead of being an ignorant yankee bastard you open your eyes up to the problem. 85% of Americans are insured, a good proportion of those have such large excesses they might as well not be insured, almost all of them would pay less for their healthcare by paying into a public funded scheme, that's the difference between a business and a not for profit public body.

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1391085034.0,"&gt;  There is less inherent value in a Gender Studies degree than most any other choice, STEM or not.

That sounds reasonable.  Now let's look at programmer salaries in my city alone. The *starting* pay can range from $25,000 to $60,000. That's a huge range for very similar degrees (there is a choice of several degrees you can use to get a programmer job.)

&gt; This is largely why I'm against the suggestions of having student loans be waived after ten years. We should not socialize the cost of bad choices, and some choices of major can definitely be a bad choice.

From a common sense point of view, I agree. From a political view, limiting who gets their student loan waived can be a really sticky situation and SOMEONE will cry ""racism"" or ""sexism"" or ""-ism"" and file a lawsuit which will get a lot of publicity. The easy political choice is to allow all loans from all types of degrees to be waived after 10 years. This is why politics so often does not follow common sense decisions.

Next, I saw a shiny Golbat in Pearl. The thing is, I was simply running through a cave and wanted to get to the exit as fast as possible. I was out of Repels, so I was running from every encounter. Needless to say, I ran away from the Golbat. I only noticed it's shininess after pressing ""Run away""...

Two years later, when I was at my boyfreind's flat, I couldn't sleep, so I took my laptop to the living room and decided to play Emerald. I made myself a small team with the Pokemons you find at the beginning. I was grinding in the tall grass, when suddenly... A shiny Lotad appeared ! I immediately saved the game, before even catching it (I was playing on an emulator, so it's possible). I caught it rather easily. I kicked the Lotad I already had in my party and put my shiny in it's place.

Now, I had another dilemma... My shiny was stuck in the emulator ! I had no idea how to bring it over to my physical cartridges.

The solution presented itself about one year later. I got my hands on an R4 Gold and a real Emerald cart. I was able to put my save with my shiny in the cartridge, and PalPark it over to Pearl. It is now waiting for the Bank to be released to be brought over to Y. :)

During that that year I got a shiny Liepard in Black. It jumped out at me as I was playing at my job. :)

And lately I got a shiny Beartic from the friend Safari.

I got a lot of shinies through trading (mostly clones) and SVExchange, but the ones I caught myself are very special to me, and I wouldn't trade them for anything else. :3"

fatalcharm,AskReddit,1391085525.0,"On LSD, I was at my friends house in the garage which was done up like a bar with a pool table and pictures of Elvis hanging up on the walls. The walls were exposed brick too. The mortar in between the bricks appeared to be melting, and made it look like the walls were bleeding. Also, all the pictures of Elvis looked 3-dimensional, Elvis's head was popping out of them.  I remember looking around the room and saying to my friends (who were also on LSD) ""What the fuck is up with Elvis?"" and they all fell to the ground in hysterics, as if I just said the funniest thing in the world. I also became obsessed with my friends socks, they had buttons on them and I couldn't figure out why socks would need buttons, it was a mystery that needed to be solved and I spent a decent amount of time trying to solve the mystery before forgetting about the socks and moving on to something else.

Please read [the article](http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/why-are-so-many-u-s-women-dying-during-childbirth/article_dd916b4b-38f0-5bae-ba42-ddee636e4cf4.html) before brushing it aside as irrelevant. It has a lot of interesting points, such as:

&gt;Doctors say pregnancy has become increasingly risky for several reasons: the prevalence of obesity, Type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease; more older women having children; advancements in fertility treatments resulting in twin births; and the high rate of C-sections.

[...]

&gt;The leading causes of pregnancy-related deaths are changing. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began in 1987 taking a closer look at maternal deaths, hemorrhage was blamed for more than one in four. Now it’s diseases of the heart and blood vessels.

&gt;Deaths from stroke are also on the rise. A recent CDC study shows pregnancy-related strokes increased by 50 percent in 2006-2007, compared with 1994-1996.

[...]

&gt;What hospitals can also do, many say, is promote spontaneous, vaginal births — the safest for mothers and babies. One procedure or drug increases the risk for another, often causing a cascade of interventions that ends with a C-section.

&gt;The surgery (a c-section) carries risk as well as increasing the chances for having an ectopic pregnancy or life-threatening problems with the placenta in later pregnancies. In the U.S., the C-section rate has skyrocketed to 33 percent of all births. The World Health Organization says it should be closer to 15 percent.

These are totally different issues that would not have been factors in most births in the 1900s, and they do affect maternal mortality. It cannot be brushed aside so easily.

Edit: Not only that, but the maternal mortality rates for the 1900s were probably WAY higher than that quoted figure. I'd look it up but I'm almost out the door."

ta1901,FeMRADebates,1391086139.0,"It's more theory at this point. The argument is men have no agency in the Age of Birth Control, so if they intend to have sex, and a baby is created accidentally, they have no choice to avoid CS and financial ruin (this all depends how CS is calculated, in some states it's very high). The woman has the final say in having the baby, and the men has to pay child support (legally, although the woman has the choice to forgo CS). 

Financial Abortion is, if the man gives up all rights to the child, he doesn't have to pay CS, because he never intended to have a child in the first place. Sometimes birth control (BC) fails, this does not mean a man should have extreme financial hardship due to an accident. 

One driver behind this is extremely high CS payments, it looks like in states that use income as the basis for CS. In my case, CS was 25% of my take home pay. There's no way I could afford that no matter how much I cut my spending. I'd have to stop saving for retirement and I still couldn't afford CS. 

Let me ask this subreddit: can YOU (the public) afford to pay another 25% of your net pay for anything at all for 18 years? Because that's how much my CS was. 

I'm not talking about well off guys who can afford CS, who are the minority of CS payers. I'm talking about the Average Joe who cannot afford the high rates of CS, who make up the majority of payers.

ronearc,AskCulinary,1391086155.0,"I've read the article, and while I respect the science and actualities of it. I still vastly prefer really lean meats like pork chops and turkey to be brined. They just taste better. 

Now that having been said, I don't brine the hell out of it. A couple of lean, thick center-cut boneless pork chops I would brine for no more than two hours. Even as little as a half hour. Just that extra time in the salt water solution makes them much more moist and enjoyable to eat. 

As to flavor, I'm not worried about the pork chop losing flavor. I'm just going to return that flavor with a really hard seer, with some very crispy edges, and usually a mushroom cream sauce made from the drippings. "

kwowo,INTP,1391086164.0,"Same with me, I never understood what was interesting about making up stories with your toys. I didn't even care much for most toys unless they were powered in some way or they were LEGOs. When I was finished building something with LEGO, I would either build more to add to the scene, or I'd pick it apart and build something else. With powered toys I would test their limits and come up with lots of funny stuff you could use them for, but never in an ""imagined"" world."

FountainsOfFluids,AskReddit,1391086172.0,"I understand, and I abhor them. Logic and evidence are tools we use to understand the world we live in, and those who abandon them are living in fantasies. They are immature and dangerous, and it is one of the few ways that I honestly feel some people are better than others.

Without a consistent chain of logic underpinning the universe, it would unravel. The fact that something exists makes it de facto logical. There simply is no other way to exist outside of our imagination. We might use the term ""supernatural"" to describe something outside of our current understanding, but if it is actual then it is natural. And if it exists, then it must respond somehow to detection and testing, placing it within the realm of scientific explainability. Otherwise, it would de facto not exist.
