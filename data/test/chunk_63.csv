No, you are not. The Bill of Rights is not about permissions/restrictions for people, that's what laws are for; it is about permissions/restrictions for the government. The government cannot restrict your freedom of speech, the government cannot restrict your freedom to assemble, the government cannot restrict freedom of the press. It really doesn't apply in a confrontation between people. You can still very much be charged with assault for hitting someone over a disagreement.

And flying the flag upside down when not in an emergency is not illegal. Especially when the flag they had was not a real flag. Putting it on the ground is also not illegal. Burning it, shitting on it, drawing dicks on it, none of that is illegal. It is ""forbidden"" by the US Flag Code, but the US Flag Code cannot be legally enforced. "

Then, assuming the local RCA approved BD accepts me, during Orthodox conversion, we'd have to convince Mr. Llama to give up shrimp and to become a ""proper"" Jewish man according to Orthodox standards, and I'd have to live away from my husband and/or kids (or he would...) for at least what, three months? Then I'd have to convert (and any kiddos). 

Then I'd have to get married again, without my pretty ketubah.

CrayonOfDoom,starbound,1390340133.0,"Well, by that logic, any time your character is copied from one segment of RAM to another it's destroyed.  Or any time a part of your character is moved into a register.  Your character isn't the exact bits in the exact location in RAM.  Each individual datum doesn't make up a character, rather the combination of the data into a whole.  When you combine data to form a whole, it becomes *information*.  The information of a character doesn't cease to exist, It's merely changed where it resides.  Much like how humans continually replace cells and respire, the whole of a human, and that human's identity, isn't destroyed, merely changed.
The physical location of the data doesn't matter, only that the entire collection of data forms the information representing your character."

You feel like a dick turning it down when they tried to make an effort.  I also had a friend make ""vegan"" cookies for me and I thought it was an awesome thing to do for me, and asked her what was in them simply out of curiosity, and when she listed butter I had to stop her right there.

Second, you should always get them in pairs or more. They are very social animals and often become depressed or ill when left alone.

Third, I think you should really re-evaluate the reasons for getting a pet. Rats are not, I repeat, they are not toys! If you want a loving and healthy pet you need to socialize it properly. They require *at least* an hour outside their cage *every* day, preferably more.

I've never heard about using food colouring to alter their fur and I don't know if it's dangerous. All I can say is that I would never sell rat babies to someone who just wants it because it kinda looks like a fictional creature.

Since you rent, check out your state law on repairs. In New Mexico, the landlord has 30 days to make a repair after you submit the request in writing; after that, you can legally pay 2/3 rent until the date the repair is made. If you have a really slow repair guy, chances are something like that would light a fire under his butt.

TheFarnell,Quebec,1390340232.0,"Je suis d'accord - l'imbécilité est une réalité qu'il faut considérer.  C'est pour ça qu'il faut légiférer les balises de façon rationnelle et précise - le faire en fonction de l'apparence de croyance religieuse, c'est pas mal la chose la *moins* rationnelle et précise imaginable.

Y'a des postes ou c'est parfaitement logique d'imposer certaines restrictions vestimentaires.  Par exemple:

- Un enseignant offre un service moins bon quand il est impossible de voir son visage - certains élèves ont besoin de voir les lèvres du prof pour mieux comprendre, pour donner une raison parmi des centaines de bonnes raisons d'exiger ça *pour un enseignant*.  Le tchador est donc à proscrire *aux enseignants*, pas parce que c'est un vêtement ""ostentatoire"" religieux, mais simplement parce qu'il cache le visage.

- Un ouvrier de construction doit, *pour des raisons de sécurité*, porter un casque.  Un sikh qui veut porter un turban ne pourra pas le faire (à moins que la CSST approuve d'un espèce de turban-casque jugé sécuritaire), pas parce que c'est un symbole religieux, mais parce que le port de casque est obligatoire pour des raisons de sécurité.

La question nébuleuse et absurde qui impose au gouvernement de définir ce qui est et ce qui n'est pas religieux n'a pas sa place.  La même logique peut s'appliquer partout - la seule contrainte devrait être en fonction de la capacité de l'employé de remplir ses tâches et rien d'autre.

On a qu'a faire les règlements en fonction des *besoins réels*, clairs et facilement définissables, et pas des *besoins émotifs*, et l'espace à l'imbécilité sera grandement restreinte.  Pour le reste, c'est pour ça qu'on a les cours, et c'est le prix de vivre dans une société libre.  Le ""one-size-fits-all"", c'est contraire à la démocratie moderne."

Also, crimes like this might have different outcomes in Norway and in America (if you're not from the US, I'm sorry, that's just what seemed to be the case), as we had about 45 victims of murder in general last year, and I'm guessing the amount of deaths associated with robbery is much lower than that, so I guess I sort of have a sense of security I maybe wouldn't have if I had grown up there.

Armagetiton,news,1390340280.0,"[Temperature](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/SimonFung.shtml)

Edit: As you can see, the exact temperature is argued, but most seem to agree that it's in the millions at the center.

What you wrote

&gt;The Hiroshima fireball was 370 metres (1,200 ft) in diameter, with a surface temperature of 6,000 °C (10,830 °F).

Key words, surface temperature. That's the very edge of the fireball. The surface of the fireball is hotter than the [surface of the sun](https://www.google.com/search?q=temperature+of+the+sun&amp;oq=temperature+of+the+sun&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0l5.2644j0j8&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=122&amp;ie=UTF-8). Just like the sun, the deeper into the fireball you get, the hotter it gets, and it increases multiplicatively. 

The fireball is created nearly instantaneously, and the instant extreme change in temperature creates the shockwave. It's the combination of the near mach 1 shockwave and extreme heat that would strip you of your flesh.

I'll admit I'm wrong on vaporization within 1m. With the extreme temperatures near the center of the fireball however, I wouldn't be surprised if everything within around 200 feet of the detonation was turned into plasma. Everyone who in the fireball was most certainly instantly killed. Everyone standing in the open within 1m was also most certainly instantly killed. Those within the cover of buildings likely suffered for minutes to an hour."

Username_of_Sean,AskMen,1390340395.0,"BDSM party at a mutual friend's house. (Post contains BDSM themes.) I'd just washed my hands after a fisting scene and went to the main room to chat. She was in the same chat circle and we eventually split into a separate conversation, discussing what toys I'd brought. When I mentioned the needles, her eyes lit up and she wanted them in her tits. Within 15 minutes of meeting her, I was making her bleed.

I've got a much longer version of this here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1tc5cs/serioushow_did_you_meet_the_love_of_your_life/ce6my73

What I generally do at parties, when I want to play with a girl, is chat with them, discuss the toys I brought, offer to show them, and then ask if they want me to use any of them. Essentially, I just talk to them. My intent is never to find a permanent partner, and that's clear enough because of the context. I managed to get one anyway, lucky me. I think this is a bit easier in the BDSM scene though, where people do pick up play all the time. Someone you play with often enough can become a closer friend or possibly a dating partner.

The question of how one met their partner comes up a lot on Reddit (and it's not the only one I find myself answering a lot). Should I retype my answer every time, or copy my previous post to the newer thread?"

ixAp0c,NewSkaters,1390340408.0,"I skated it for around 2 months before the snow hit, and it's still got a lot of snappy pop left in it.

The snow melted recently and was dry enough so I skated it a bit more, still skates really good for it's age.  

And it's an Almost Impact, it's just got the disks around the trucks.  The Impact has a carbon fiber ply in the middle too, with maple around it, while Double Impact has all of the above plus a whole ply of carbon fiber.

It was one of the first boards I skated with technology, but the deck before it lost it's pop in about a month (30$ mini-logo), and razortailed very quickly.

My next deck will be a Toy Machine, with no technology, so I'll see if this deck really lives up to its hype once I skate a similar priced deck with no technology.  

It's got a really stiff feel to it, it doesn't feel like a normal maple board when you first stand on it, you have to get used to it.  

Once you get used to the stiffness, it has that new-deck feel for a really long time.  It still kind of has that feel, its taking a lot longer to lose the pop.  

So yeah I would say that these live up to their hype, I was ready to buy an Almost Impact Plus (between Impact and Double Impact, there are 3 versions of Impact) but the board in my size went out of stock. 

Could be a blessing in disguise, the deck I'm looking at really calls to me (the graphic), I am very picky with deck art. "

avantvernacular,FeMRADebates,1390340412.0,"&gt; Kind of suggests that currency and kyriarchy are linked. 

No it doesn't at all suggest that. Pretty much the opposite; that they are not. It suggests that wealth based class and currency are linked. You had it here: 

&gt;   I believe you are very much connecting currency with classes based on wealth.

But then you lost it, and somehow changed your mind mid comment to the former. So which of the two do you feel I'm linking, because it can't be both. 


&gt;It seems illogical that kyriarchy would be the explanation for why men and women born into the same class have differing lives, unless it could be argued that men are simply more likely to be born to rich parents biologically.

Is based on ignorance of that link between currency and class. The absence of logic you see is a result of that ignorance, combined with the ignorance that the definition of kyriarchy is somehow dependent on classes. Had I been aware of the later at the time, I would have mentioned it  - but since most people don't usually alter the definitions of words (especially after looking them up themselves) I had no reason to assume you would at the time. 

To put it as insanely simply as possible: a kyriarchy and classes can exist independently the same way a spaceship and potatoes can exist independently. Can you put potatoes in a spaceship? Sure! But i had no reason to believe you would assume that a spaceship could not exist without potatoes - especially after looking up the definition of a spaceship. 

I'm curious as to why you feel that despite your own source not saying it, kyriarchy is dependent on class. Why add that to your interpretation, rather than simply using the actual definition you linked. It seems your whole argument hinges upon you altering your source. "

Check the kill switch first, although I doubt that this is the problem.

If everything is dead, /u/jcftfghrtr is probably ride - blown fuse. Find the fuse box, pull the fuses, and you should see that one has blown. If you can't see one, buy a cheap meter (about £6 from somewhere like Maplins or Amazon). Turn it to the resistance scale (Ω, or 200Ω if you have to choose a range. Remove each fuse and check the resistance - it should be less that 1Ω. Replace if it's wrong.

Now put the fuses back in, and change the meter to the volts (V) scale. Put the black contact on the negative terminal of the battery.  Turn the bike on, and touch the positive terminal to each of the terminals for the fuses (doesn't matter which end of the fuse). You should find at least some of them are showing about 12.6V. If not, there's a problem between the battery and the rest of the bike.

Can you do that and post the results back here? Also if you have a manual, can you scan the circuit diagram and put it up on Imgur so that we can do a bit more on diagnostics?

BTW, /r/fixxit is a good place for advice on bike mechanics specifically. If you don't find an obvious fault with the fuses, it might be a good idea to put the problem up there as someone might be familiar with a fault on this particular bike."

I have not yet tracked the exact temp range in there yet, but based on feel I think it doesn't drop below 40ish at night, and I highly doubt it gets above 55 during the day?

I wanted to try a Schwartzbier (german black lager) or a dunkel bock, etc. I have never messed around with lager yeast, so I'm a little daunted (not a feeling I'm used to).

Isn't this a sign you need to find something that goes motivate you?  You already have seemed to have accomplished a lot. Make a new list of challenges. Make your own curve balls.

They won't put you into inpatient unless you truly need it. If you do need it... I mean, being confined somewhere (with other people having severe issues) is never fun, but you just need to try to keep in mind there is always a reason they do what they do. There is a reason you're getting the treatment you are. There is a reason they have the rules they do.

dianthe,dogs,1390340715.0,"My two year old Samoyed very quickly picks up words for things he likes and doesn't like. For example if you say the word ""Petco"", which is his favorite shop, he will stare at you. If you say the word ""ears"" (he HATES having his ears cleaned) he will put his ears back and cower. 

He also remembers every single spot the bottle with ear cleaning solution ever stood on and will carefully check those as he enters the room to make sure it isn't an ""ambush"" lol I keep his toothbrush and toothpaste in the same box as the ear cleaning bottle and if I go to that box he watches me very carefully, if I say ""teeth"" he will come up to me and sit down to have his teeth brushed, if I say ""ears"" he will try to hide. 

He understands things like ""Do you want to stay or come with?"" - if he wants to stay he stays at his spot if he wants to come with he goes to the door. 

He also remembers all the places he likes, for example on Sunday we were driving somewhere and drove past the road that leads to the dog park. The closer we got to the turn the more excited he got and when we drove past it he started crying and ran to the back window and was staring at that turn for as long as he could see it while crying, as if saying ""You missed it!!"".

We started teaching him names of his toys as well when he was a puppy and he knew ""ball"" and ""rope"", and also ""stick"" outside. But we haven't kept up on it, perhaps we should because I think he definitely has the capacity to learn more words :)

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1390340723.0,"I am a woman and I do think there are many things that are tough about being a woman, but men have it tough, too.  Biologically, we both deal with crazy hormones, but the difference is that guys deal with an extreme amount of it in puberty, and then they adjust. Women deal with big changes in puberty, but your hormones continue to cause big changes to your mood and body in a way that is often hard to understand. In addition to the monthly changes with your menstrual cycle, there are huge changes with pregnancy and menopause. Something that often doesn't get discussed is how often your body can just totally change its hormonal balance, often without any apparent cause. You can suddenly have mood swings, gain/lose weight, your boobs change, your skin/hair changes...it's like going through puberty again as an adult, and for some women this happens every few years.


In terms of gender roles, I think guys have a lot of pressure to ""be a man"", ""suck it up"", ""don't show your feelings"", etc. I am glad that as a woman I am not faced with ridicule if I show my feelings. In some ways, men have less freedom about how to act, dress, talk, etc. than women. Women can like ""bro"" things and be considered cool. She might not be taken seriously, but at she also might. A man who likes ""girly"" things is considered lame.

Men traditionally have more pressure to be protectors and providers for their loved ones, at the expense of their own desires, whereas women are expected to be nurturers. Both genders have to sacrifice, but in different ways. If you're a man you're faced with the threat of being drafted for war. If you're on a sinking boat you have to give your life so the women and children can live. And so on. Even on a small scale, you are expected to do the dirty work in daily life. I personally detest this but most of my friends are very quick to call their male friends and relatives if they ever have a car problem, plugged toilet, mouse to kill, etc. My girlfriends have this attitude of entitlement like they should not have to deal with icky things. 

As a girl, you learn that being nice and putting good effort gets you through a lot in life. As a boy, you learn that you have to compete and prove yourself. You learn at a young age to deal with explicit failure and rejection. Girls have to learn as they grow older that the reason people cut them slack is that they don't really expect much from them anyway. It's a different kind of struggle.  

Girls make small talk with each other and build easy friendships, even if they turn out to be backstabbing friendships. A girl on her first day of school might be dismissed by the ""queen bee"" type girls but she stands a pretty good chance of a few girls reaching out to her. Guys are less open toward strangers. They bond indirectly and over a longer period of time. 

Both sexes deal with the threat of violence, but not a lot is talked about how that can be hard on guys. Getting in fights or being beaten up are pretty traumatic things, but guys are forced to brush it off and act like it's normal. I'm not trying to say this is a bigger problem  than the violence women face, but it's just not acknowledged that often.

Again, this is a complete non-issue. A 430w PSU is way more than enough. The only real reason for going with that instead of a 350/380 is that most smaller PSUs you'll find are way worse in other aspects than the CX430, but cost more. "

Well I was going to go anyway, but I really enjoyed telling my friends that Arnold had told me to go work out. Work kept me late that night and they really didn't appreciate ""I NEED to get to the gym before it closes, I made a promise to Arnold"", but I managed to get there and did some heavy-ass deadlifts (these days they'd be light to me, of course!) with tons of motivation.

It's around a year later now and I'm still a novice gym rat in my eyes. These things take time. But I'm hitting those weights 5 or 6 days a week. Funnily enough I watched Pumping Iron for the first time two nights ago, and I felt so great that THAT SAME ARNOLD had ever taken the time to answer a question of mine.

Here's my question: Did you still feel ""small"" when you were training for consecutive world bodybuilding titles?

It's not a strange word but it has more implications of 'lacking' light rather than just having little of it. Wouldn't really work here.

&gt; I was hoping that by saying syvälle metsään I could imply the verb menee.

You sort of could. But not clearly enough that it doesn't sound a bit disjointed (to my ear, at least) when you switch from entering the forest directly to something happening on the moss. It's kind of implied anyway that the rays come from outside the forest. This is definitely debatable, though.

&gt; And another question: could I say ilman ihmisittä? Would that sound too strange? What does that sound like?

It sounds like a double negation that doesn't mean anything. I think *ihmisittä* would be technically correct, but *ilman ihmisiä* sounds more natural. One phrase which springs to mind – but probably won't be useful here – is *ei ristin sielua*, ""not a soul in sight"" (lit. ""not a/the soul of a/the cross"")."

It is the only game in the series that I gave up on before even completing the main storyline (I watched the cutscenes on youtube to get the story), for many reasons from boring side missions to just overall boringness, not to mention the choppy UI.

I always thought it was very odd that AC3 was that bad. I love all the other entries in the series to death, and replay them every once and a while.

Now I know why AC3 is the exception to the rule. It makes sense that trying to meet such a tight deadline at the same time as other big releases would effect it.

etruscan,boardgames,1390340842.0,"Sometimes those dummy votes are like a bad pair of goggles... zey do nossing! 

Take a game like Robinson Crusoe. It's probably a great game, but it's hard to tell that from the stats. It's accumulated so many incredibly positive votes so fast (and very few negative votes) that it has skyrocketed into the top 20 almost overnight, completely overriding the negative effect that those dummy votes might have had early on.

That might not be a bad thing if it's actually a really good game, but I suspect of the 3000 or so ratings it has, most of those people are heavy euro gamers to whom RC caters, and they're bound to rate it highly. Of those 3000 votes, about 2400 rated it over an 8. That means 88% of people like the game a lot. Good numbers, and enough to just edge it over Dominion, a game which has accumulated 34,000 votes (about 84% of which are above an 8). 

This is deceiving. When Robinson Crusoe accumulates 34,000 votes (10x what it has now) will it still be rocking 88% of them over an 8? Maybe. But quite possibly not. Only time will tell.

...so a game needs time to settle into its votes, and if a game like Paths Of Glory can maintain those numbers 15 years later, it probably deserves a high ranking. The flip side of the argument (to speak to what the OP is saying) is that if this game *was* generating new votes (which it's not because it's out of print) then those votes would be comparing the game to other current games, which might look different than the votes it generated back in 1999.

-Put all money on chips. Put all transactions and balance online. This does not mean ""Tim Smith bought porn videos for $40."" It'd be ""Tim Smith, 1/21/14 spent $40. Current balance is ######"". This would help so that the rich and politicians cant put all of their money into fake accounts before being taxed.


-Increase the nation minimum wage to a wage in which you can support yourself, your spouse and two children.


-Set a maximum wage, which would be upper middle class.


-Seize all needed resources and factory and give it to the government.


-Make it so that corporations can only have enough money to produce, distribute, pay their employees and give the heads of the corporation the maximum wage.


-Rework the courtrooms. One neutral lawyer that works with investigators and is not revealed until the day of trial.


-Politicians can only make minimum wage, no matter how many jobs they have.


-Tax the churches.


-Tax even nonprofits.


-Legalize homosexual marriage.


-Legalize marijuana.


-Fire the entire NSA. Replace all employees.


-Hire one thousand people without corporate ties, people of all classes, religions, political ideologies and have them keep a close eye on the doings of the CIA, NSA and FBI.


-Let these representatives to the security forces have votes on if they should reveal information to the American people.


-Have a new ""Geneva Convention"" in the US, even if we are the only signers. Ban all chemical and biological weapons (even our own). Treat occupied peoples as our own citizens for as long as the war is going on.


-Ban the mention of a god for politicians. SEPERATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.


-Stop spying on our own people and allied nations. Instead use the new resources to keep a close eye on Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Pakistan and other countries. Use the rest of the resources to try and end slavery/sex trafficking and other criminal activities within our borders.


-Cut alliances and trade agreements with Japan, Israel and Saudi Arabia.


-Cut all ties with the People's Republic of China. Formally recognize Taiwan.


-Place sanctions on the following nations: Japan, China, Russia, Ukraine, Pakistan, India, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Kenya, Israel and Turkey.

The most common form of transportation is entirely up to you. Flying creatures like griffons would be better if you want to stay away from even a little bit of steampunk, but there are plenty of ways you can magically describe how flying vehicles could exist, from ""it's magic/blessed by angels"" to enslaved air elementals. It's up to you. The method you pick will affect things like maneuverability for combat, as well as how free someone on a flying transport is to use their hands (riding a beast probably requires one or both hands).

Maybe there are monsters in the oceans? Maybe some people do live in the oceans, and have formed something like a different nation than the air people, so they don't interact too much or want to switch from one to the other? Why do some animals fly and some swim? Why do some people become pilots and others naval captains? These questions might help give you some ideas.  The decision is entirely up to you."

kiwirish,hockey,1390341323.0,"I'll answer for Brown, because I watch enough Kings hockey to accurately give him a fair description, while Perry I do not.

Generally speaking, most of the 'bad guys' in the league play in the West right? Think about it, Brown is a goon, Perry is a shithead, Torres is a cheapshot artist, Kesler dives, and the Sedins are soft. These are all western reputations, and it comes down to the fact that since the West is so far away from the main population, that most don't see the games out here and so these guys tend to only make headlines for bad things.

The Kings are in the Pacific time zone, so about 70% of our games start at 7pm PT, or 10pm ET, so they'll finish in the east well after midnight. Then another 15% probably takes place one time zone over. Another 10% in Central and only about 5% probably take place in the Eastern time zone, so lots our games go missed by national media. Therefore whenever something controversial happens, it gets attention, but otherwise not much gets talked about out east. 

Add in the fact that on the West coast, we're so far removed from all other teams that we are bitter rivals, means that those that do actually watch our games hate us naturally and will build hate on players whether deserved or not.

Now I won't try argue that Brown is an angel and that he does nothing wrong, but I will argue that he hits hard and hard hitters occasionally make mistakes. The hit on Pominville was bad and punished accordingly, to date it's his only suspension. The attempted hit against St Louis in the playoffs last year was bad and went unnoticed by the refs and league, and I won't try defend his actions there. The hit on Rozsival in the 2012 playoffs was not dirty at all and was blown out of proportion by angry Coyotes fans. Which was for good reason, I'd be pissed too if we missed our first chance to go to the SCF, but there was nothing dirty about the hit under league rules.

Brown doesn't load up 50 point seasons, or score hat tricks, so there's not much big positive media to talk about him, which skews the negative media to make him seem worse than he is. He has gotten one suspension over a sustained career and has proved himself a good leader that leads by example, by being the hard hitting, hard working, gritty player that LA wants in their organisation.

**TL;DR: Would USA Hockey really take a dirty, cheap shot artist prick to the Olympics? I don't think so.**

Why aren't average demographic bros and bro-ettes who come to reddit for the memes, as interested in actual social justice, as they are in the shit that resonates with the bros and bro-ettes (wont somebody please think of the brochachos?)...

You realise what a hipster feminist nerd douchebag you'd sound to the average adviceanimals user right now. I should meme you so you can see the comments.

I think you've got to try not to worry about the posters in advice animals so much, reddit is awful, those kind of defaults the most awful of them all.

For example: If you actually wanted to reach them and their demographic, with anything SJ re: rape, you'd have to intercept it more stealthily. Theres a ""scumbag stacy's"" (plural) meme i noticed lately. Get a well researched comment with lots of resources prepared, like your spousal rape link, etc, which as being the most constructive will probably get top comment and the gold if posted at the start of the thread, and post a ""scumbag stacys"" about false rape claims discrediting real rape victims, then the top comment educates as to the scale of the rape issue, and gets in as the contrarian/deep comment that expands on the meme. If you post some stats heavy long winded shit on advice animals, it wont get anywhere. Adviceanimals will reward edgy glib opinions that sound punchy, try doing social justice soundbites like that, its not as easy to reduce. Also, you will fail if you are going to sound like a ""SRS harpy"" which on default reddit are non too popular, probably due to the historical brigade culture. Yeah, if you come across as feminist, in a sub like that, you will probably not do so well.

i only know one ISTP, but i know him quite well. given that, this is a very individual experience that i could never guarantee applies to all ISTP's, but here's a look at one of my best friends:

dat materialism. holy shit this dude likes STUFF. he's a straight man who wears foundation. he overhauls his closet semi-annually and compulsively shops on ebay. he's a stoner who is always buying the new, strange, ridiculous paraphernalia. oddly, however, he's not that into decorating.

at his best this kid can learn anything and actually put it to use. he compounds knowledge in a completely different way than i do. when i have an epiphany it's like adding the last piece to a puzzle and having it all come together in complete clarity. when this guy has an epiphany it's like putting the last detail onto a sandcastle and stepping back to admire one's handiwork. he learns about things in such a practical way that information can't really be useless to him. instead of adding complexity and obscuring truth as knowledge usually does to me, knowledge compounds on top of itself and makes truth more evident to him.

at his worst... well you think an INTP existential crisis is bad? imagine having one and also failing to fully grasp much of the meaning behind the patterns that disturb you. shades of grey are tough for this kid. his intelligence combined with the way he learns forces him to shift his worldview drastically and often. usually he finds tremendous satisfaction in the worldviews that come after the shift, but whenever this guy's idea of truth comes crashing down around him he's left in a very frantic state desperately trying to grasp something that feels like reality to him.

overall he's a VERY open minded person, but he only entertains the perspectives of those he holds in high regard (and he is fussy about respecting people). he tends to have very long term relationships (romantic and otherwise) and they usually have a small element of dysfunction to them. when he gets attached to someone he'll work to maintain the relationship even as the world alters its dynamic. he's also very SLOW (or at least that is how i perceive him), yet you can tell his mind is constantly going. i occasionally get impatient waiting for him to complete communicating an idea and interrupt. he speaks slowly, moves slowly, and puts together ideas more slowly than i do, but his mind does not move slowly at all; he is always noticing details that i miss. on the whole i think he's a very interesting person to know. i think INTPs and ISTPs can make excellent friends."

Each one of the 4 ""elite"" qb's (Manning Brady Rodgers Brees) has a strength.  Mannings is pre-play reading the Defense,  Bradys is always finding the open man and making good decisions, Rodgers is his ability to make plays out of nothing consistently, and Brees' is similar to Brady.

Essentially what you do is that if you suspect someone is going to move in, DO NOT load your main character.  Instead, go to ""New Save File"" and create a new character.  You can use this character to go look around town.  If you see a villager's house in an undesirable place, or even a villager that you don't like, you can power off and try again with a new save file.  When the villager's house is in a location you like, go ahead and talk to Isabelle and then Tom Nook to set up your house.  Once your house is up, talk to Isabelle one last time and she'll give you your TPC.  *Then* your town will be saved.  When you load up your main file, the villager's house should be where it was before, and then you can just demolish the alternate account's house.

The reasoning behind this is because when Isabelle loads your main file, it loads everything for the day.  But when you create a new file, it doesn't save until you get your TPC.

But like \u\BatFace said, peoples' save files have been corrupted before, so do it at your own risk."

IAMA_dragon-AMA,furry,1390342035.0,"You sound a little defensive, as if you're trying say you want to do it, but you're rationalizing it and saying it would be weird.

Like three months ago I would have said yes but now, I would still say yes but in a different way. I still would wan't to have sex with a pony, but not really a character, maybe Fluttershy, Octavia, Luna, Lyra, you know? But I really don't like mlp anymore so this answer is based on purely a sexual standpoint.

Ponies are probably the sexiest things I've ever seen in my life, not exactly the characters, just what they are, their legs, their eyes, their manes, their mouths, everything is perfect. I would totally have sex with them but I wouldn't want to live in Equestria or any of that bullshit. I would like to keep one but she probably wouldn't like it because she would have to hide and just hang out in my house. 

A one night thing? Totally, anyone really. I don't like all of them but even if Rainbow Dash was my only option I would say yes. I don't know how they would translate in real life but there are plenty fan art pictures that show a good example. 

I don't think I would be to comfortable with one around me because, I wouldn't know what to do? Do I feed it? Do I pay attention to it? I don't care what I do around my dog because he's a fucking dog, do I treat her like a human and talk to her? Back to my dog, what if he flips shit because there is a god damn flying pony in my house. I couldn't leave her alone because thats not fair at all, and she might fuck something up or answer the door and screw our deal up. I can't take her in public.

I would totally keep her forever but I don't think it would be a paradise, for her especially. Regardless of how I treat her she is basically a sex slave and that all well and good for a roleplay situation but it would be her life and she can't get away from it. At least I would have some information on her and know what to do a little bit. If she got into the hands of some hick across the street she is fucked. 

Bottom line, I think I would be too selfish to pass it up but my life would be stressful as hell trying to figure out what to do with her afterwards. So many things would have to be accounted for and in the end, she wouldn't like it, and neither would you after awhile. I don't know if you would be taking her from ""Equestria"" of whatever or if she is just appearing and doesn't know how to talk or eat or fly or whatever, in that case, no I wouldn't do it, I'm not raising a god damn pony just so I can fuck it. Otherwise, yes, like I said I would be too selfish and I couldn't pass it up. 

Now to how it would work, I don't know. I guess the act of sex would be pretty normal, shes basically a horse, just a lot cuter. If she spoke english and had a basic understanding of the situation and was reasonable to let me talk to her and explain how this is going to work, then it would be pretty fine. Although, other things like going outside, telling people, etc. would be hard to work out. 

I would need a Celesta to check up on her and tell me what she eats and if she is sick she is pretty shit out of luck unless I can buy some OTC medication for her. I wouldn't have to worry about her being pregnant, right? I don't think she can get pregnant by a human.

Anyway, sure. But she would have to live up to the exceptions of a canon pony, like knowing basics like English, eating, walking, etc. "

So, as countries continue to develop, it is likely we will see population contraction, not growth.  Not even taking into account that they lumped India and China in to make it to 2 children per adult couple on average.  China, with its one child policy and India that has gone from a 3 children/woman to a 2.5 children/woman in the last 5 years.  It is likely, based on trends, that the world will settle just below 2 child/woman, so we will end up with a slow global population contraction  if the trends continue."

Moyes isn't good enough to bridge a 6 point gap in 12 or less games. Also Europe to cope with will blunt any surge they make. No threat unless they make a huge signing in the next 10 days imo.

* Spurs - so inconsistent. Don't see them being a threat if we can beat them at home (which I am fully confident of). Again Europe will blunt any threat. Assuming we beat them I'm not worried. 

* Everton - only real threat but have even thinner squad than us. If we beat them then we'll be safe. "

Now, given that....if we're less picky and can't quite walk up to anyone and ask....sometimes we can forego actually liking someone so we can get laid. The penis doesn't quite care what the brain thinks.

bobbyg27,AskReddit,1390342221.0,"I was a French minor in college (or ""university"" as non-Americans say... giveaway number one?) and after graduating lived for six months in Paris. I was pretty fluent before I went abroad, but after about a month I really upped my game and could navigate complex conversations about subjects with which I was unfamiliar without a blip.

One night sticks out for me, though, when I was at a bar with my friends (several of whom are French). I went up to the bar to by my group a round of drinks, and after taking my drink order the French bartender girl smiled and me and asked if I was American. I was a little taken aback (I had thought my French was near perfect, especially after hanging around younger, casual French speakers for a while; ""slang""/""young person"" French is a lot easier to get away with, they skip a lot of words and over-use the simpler tenses). I asked her if it was because I had an accent and the response I got back was along the lines of ""No, it's just how you carry yourself.""

I was surprised because I had not noticed an equal-but-opposite posture or attitude effect in regards to French people. But I went back to my table with the drinks and asked my French friends and they all agreed with the bartender and assumed I already knew everyone could tell I was an American. It was kind of funny. Like other people have mentioned here, it has a lot to do with an outward-facing confidence, edging up on arrogance (especially for a stranger).

I believe there are a lot of subtle things that drive this overall label, like maintaining eye-contact for longer than a culture tends to do, physical personal space, voice volume level and even assertiveness and using ""stronger terms"" in conversation.  I think about my sister, who visited Japan and was fluent in Japanese, and in that culture there is such an aversion to coming off as rude that the conversation heavily favors politeness and avoiding imposition, to the point where every request turns into a shy nerdy guy asking a girl out (""Hey, feel free to say no, I totally understand, but would you, if you don't have any plans or anything, want to go see a movie with me on Friday? And like I said if you're not interested or if you can't make it it's totally cool and we can still be friends."" versus ""Hey, come see a movie with me Friday!"")

FountainsOfFluids,AskMen,1390342317.0,"You are completely right. Cubemstr is really not getting it, and probably making people uncomfortable.

Best way I've found is one of three ways:

1. Keep the issue on the back burner until a segue appears. ""Hey, that reminds me. I'm volunteering and I think you should come with me."" This is almost always the best way to keep a discussion natural feeling. It's the way humans talk about almost everything. The problem is that it's almost impossible to do if you feel the discussion is urgent. In that case, try tactic 2 or 3.

2.  Dive straight in. If it's a normal, day to day matter that needs some correction, just hit them with the question or problem. ""Bob, you keep leaving trash around the house and it's driving me crazy."" That's way better than ""Do you have a minute to talk? (Sit down on couch together) I need to discuss your inability to keep the apartment tidy."" Ugh! Over dramatic and uncomfortable! The direct approach can also work for relationship issues if it's something that is really bothering you and you can't wait for a more natural time to discuss it.

3. This third one is especially needed for sex talks: Wait for the mood, people. Maybe you're on the couch with a couple of glasses of wine, maybe you're parked in the car making out, or maybe it's simply over a romantic lunch where the talk turns sexy, something like that. You want to bring up your fantasies or fetishes? First ask your partner about theirs. Be a good listener and honestly engage. Then after you've discussed theirs, bring the subject around to yours. Same tactic for almost any sex or relationship topic.

IndignantChubbs,explainlikeimfive,1390342384.0,"You're failing to mention a very important aspect of natural monopolies. They are much better served by a state-owned enterprise than a private firm. Because there is no competition the profit motive fails to incentivize actions that promote social welfare. You can reap huge surpluses by doing a shitty job, which is exactly what happens in the status quo. A state-owned enterprise, on the other hand, does not have the same inherent motivation and so can do things (keep prices low, expand service) that reduce profit without harming the SOE. 

Markets perform abysmally with natural monopolies. Telecommunications should be under the purview of a state-owned enterprise, not profit-seeking private firms."

I'd say you either want (a) one big, horizontal piece of art above your media center, or (b) a collection of equal-sized vertical frames. The easiest way to do (b) would be to get three vertical frames of equal size that, when you take into account the inch or so you will leave between the frames, will be wide enough to cover the space above your media stand.

IAMA_dragon-AMA,furry,1390342468.0,"It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know.

That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.

I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?"
Username_of_Sean,offmychest,1390342468.0,"It's not that they forget others are real people, but that they have no face or name attached to their own posts. They're anonymous or anonymous enough to not need to conform to social norms of politeness, as there cannot be any meaningful retribution. Worst case scenario, they make a new username.

Those people are taking off their mask and showing who they really are. They're simply not nice people. They probably act nice in person.

In some ways, this feature can be good too. This anonymity allows people to discuss things they can't discuss offline. This subreddit is a good example of that. I know I use internet anonymity to talk about things I don't want people who know me to know all the time.

As for the downvotes, it can be odd. I have plenty of posts that either have downvotes or even a bunch of upvotes and a bunch of downvotes, showing confliction on my post, to which my response is just: ""Huh?"". Occasionally there's a reply, which makes things clearer, but usually not."

A puzzle is an activity that has a clear finish that will give a sense of accomplishment. And lastly, you can even glue the puzzle together and frame it as a memento of the date.

Escape92,actuallesbians,1390342596.0,"Nobody really can make ice fly out of their fingers, so what is Elsa a metaphor for? I can't hear Elsa as anything other than a metaphorical gay princess - and for now I'm happy with that.

As other people have said, it would be unlikely to be financially viable for Disney to confirm that she is actually gay, and the situation is likely to remain the same for a while. 

I also think that the idea of a sequel to Frozen would likely focus more on Anna. We've had the whole message of 'keeping a part of yourself hidden for your parents' sake is unhealthy and makes you hurt your sister and will cause blizzards over the whole country' from this one, and so it would make sense that they would explore a little more about Anna's relationships and why she feels this desperate rush to fall in love. I would expect to see a Frozen 2 about Anna struggling to maintain a relationship with Christoph because of the temptation of someone else, and a big discussion about how your young loves may not be your last loves.

On a slightly unrelated note, did anyone find that it affected them as a big sister? The bit in ""Do you want to build a snowman"" where Anna asks the question, is told to go away by Elsa, and then says ""ok, bye"" in a really sad voice has me in tears just thinking about it. I went to see it in the cinema with my 7 year old sister, and I blubbed the whole way through. Remember how much your siblings look up to you, guys!"

Marshall: Stability and stereotypical: man brings home the bacon, wife cooks it for the family.

Lily: Adventure and fun: going with the flow and going against the typical housewife future.

Think of their dreams of their family when they bought the apartment.

Marshall: playing drums, guitars and having mom brings over some freshly baked cookies.

Lily: teaching them how to paint, lots of (suggested) travels to France and other European countries to expose them to art, dad brings over some lemonade.

They've wanted different things this whole time, and this is just the situation that needed to be brought to life in order for them to see and address it.

*Also, when you're in a relationship - you cannot bring up the past. That's rule number one with relationship discussions/fights/arguments what have you. It's not fair to either party. You discuss issues as they come along and either accept and move on or take a good look at what you both have and see if this is actually the right thing for what you both want. It was a low blow that Marshall brought that up to Lily, however she brought up a statement that warranted a response very similar to what he delivered."

So I heard a thing about Lucy Lawless (actress who played Xena), where she had to do a nude scene and they gave her a mirkin (a pubic wig, basically) so that she would have a full enough bush to get away with having full frontal nudity on TV. 

Lucy Lawless didn't need no mirkin. She hung that shit up on her wall and revealed her glorious, thick bush to the world.

WalterFStarbuck,skeptic,1390342771.0,"&gt;Absolutely and categorically FALSE, and complete and total BULLSHIT!

I was told this by a university neuroscientist several years back when I was an undergraduate. I'm not a biologist or very knowledgeable about human physiology so when I called him on it and he said that our brains do, I took his word for it. Since I knew his credentials and you're a random internet person, I wouldn't mind seeing some evidence/study that he was wrong or I misunderstood. 

&gt;Care to cite these 'studies'? It must be Nazi science, because experimentation on human brains is both illegal and immoral. 

I agree. There are several episodes of the series ""Dark Matters"" that detail what we know about the human brain and its function and some of the ways we learned them before human testing conditions were so rigorously controlled. I can't recall exactly but I think it was the episode on lobotomies. Another I recall was from the series ""Through the Wormhole"" which showed a lab that could recreate the physiological effect of prayer and cause people to feel they were having a sort of religious experience. I don't think that involved any surgery though.

&gt;The idea that there is a radiated signal is even more ridiculous. 

Basic electromag physics should tell you it's at least possible. There are electrical currents in our bodies and brains, however small. Where there are moving electrical currents, there are resulting electrical fields, however weak. 

&gt;WTF!?

The article was claiming that our hearts were the source of whatever nonsense the authors believed. All I was saying is that if you could actually 'sense' anything from the heart it couldn't possibly tell you anything more than what we already measure (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate, etc...)."

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1390342775.0,"First, I didn't really look to argue this. If the mods wanted to ban the letter ""r"" and the number 3, I'd be all behind that, and it goes without saying that 3.) and 44.) above are solid. My only suggestion is already contained in my aside - that Rule 2 doesn't clearly state this, and so should.

But to go looking for trouble, most bad history has a political purpose. Even GWV and Jesus Dont Real is arguably political - note how GWV's resignation letter was more some sort of dystopian theophobic nightmare rather than just kookery for kookery's sake. So I think that 2.) &amp; Z.) may have a bumpy implementation. 

I think that political disagreement is healthy for this sub because it's always what we can point to in order to show how no, we're not all of one mind and no, we ain't nobody's shills. As %.) points out - heck, as the examples point out - we have had good discussions of modern politics, and ones that have been even so far as to being healthy. 

Is not the problem with the exemplar that it violates 3.) (incivility - unjustly painting all Libertarians as of one mold), rather than Rule 2? I mean, I feel like you run a risk of ending up in a weird, arbitrary place when you set out to say something like ""the U.S. Civil War is about slavery, but we're going to tastefully ignore why we're complaining about people offering alternate answers.""

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1390342785.0,"I think that's very true, and it can be hard on guys because they don't have much freedom with their fashion choices or the ability to wear makeup. Guys also get discounted a lot for being short, which is something they can't change.

However, I think the bigger point that Brittasboobs is making is that women are judged by their looks in all facets of their lives and from an early age. Even when looks have nothing to do with what we are doing, it is a huge part of how people perceive us.  For guys, looks are primarily important in evaluative situations such as dating, job hunting, etc.  

And the second difference is that women get judged for being ugly, judged for being average, judged for being beautiful/sexy. Beauty comes at the cost of people treating you as if that is all you have to offer. It's very hard to be recognized for your intellect or accomplishments if you are pretty. 

I think the third difference is that ""normal"" doesn't really exist as a concept for women because we are all trained to believe if we are not beautiful, we are ugly.

ctesibius,Christianity,1390342803.0,"We use the lectionary, at least for lay preachers as we're travelling around and it's one way to keep the sermons for a particular congregation more or less on one theme for a while. However it's pretty common to refer to other texts in exegesis. For instance this Sunday one of the texts in the lectionary was John 1:29-42, but to understand the ""Lamb of God"" that John refers to, it's useful to refer to Isaiah 53:7 and the surrounding verses. Putting the lectionary texts into the service leaflets does sound useful."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390342842.0,"In our society, sexual harassment has been deemed illegal, in the same way we have decided that violence and libel (insulting someone isn't necessarily illegal, but libel is a specific type of insult and is) are against our laws. I asked the other two rhetorical question because they are similarly philosophical. Obviously you want more of an answer than ""It just is"" when you ask why sexual harassment is wrong. But it's a difficult question to answer, just as difficult as why violence is wrong. It's because we as a society have decided that it we don't want it as part of our lives and civilization. We recognize any given person's right to walk down the street without getting punched in the face, the same way someone has a right to walk down the street without being sexually harassed. 

&gt;Her comfort is really her own problem, and also not something anyone can predict.

Not wanting to be yelled at by strangers is pretty predictable. That's why street harassment is heavily frowned upon more and more these days.

&gt;And with that logic no one should ever walk-up to a girl and try to pick her up, cause it may make her uncomfortable.

I don't entirely disagree with that. I think walking up to a complete stranger and asking her out right then and there is a pretty bad way to ask someone out. There is a very high chance that yes, the girl will be uncomfortable. I probably would be.

&gt; I personally don't think one ""Cat"" call is anything to be concerned about, it sucks but is what it is

You're right, one, isolated catcall isn't really that big a deal. **However**, when every man in our society thinks that and thinks his one whistle or lewd comment is small and harmless, we end up with women who get catcalled multiple times a day, every day, because it's not a big deal, right? Then when the 20th man gets snapped at, he thinks she's overreacting, whereas she's at her wit's end. I know women who live in big cities and walk to work and many have told me that they've chosen to take longer-alternative routes that eat time out of their day to avoid street harassment. I think that's pretty unreasonable. Other kinds of harassment are also not tolerated by our society. If you walk to work every day and the same guy calls you an ugly asshole and says he's going to rob you, would you take an alternate route? Or would you call the police? Catcalling is a threat, whether you think of it as one or not. Catcalling is when a guy yells at a woman ""I want to fuck you, I wish I was fucking you right now"" because whatever he's actually saying, that's what he means. And that's a threat. Women have the right to decide who they sleep with, if at all. 

&gt;If you willfully push past her shown boundaries then your committing sexual harassment, except in the work place.

I'm not sure what you mean by this. Do you mean pushing past boundaries in the work place isn't sexual harassment?"

Africanfratboy,PS4,1390343007.0,"Listen to me friend and listen well. 

Some games just should not be bought at full retail price. This is one of them. Personally most single player, 1 and done games fall into this category. Some examples are Max Payne 3, Bioshock Infinite, Vanquish, and Uncharted 3. These are games that are incredbily fun to play but, outside of the first play through don't offer much for you to chew on.

Games with a highly competitive Multi-player component or a really strong single player story and/or experience USUALLY get a first day, $60 dollar buy from me. Some examples are Battlefield, The Last of Us, GTA V and any sports titles like FIFA or 2K (I don't play these games but I understand the communities and their reasons behind wanting to.)

There is NO REASON (given how old this game is) that it should be $60. None. Considering that I was able to purchase this game at $15 dollars from Amazon during the Black Friday shopping season; it has even less legs to stand on regarding this price. And that fact stands, regardless of wether or not you played it on last-gen.

freshairr,dating_advice,1390343048.0,"I'm going to adjust my usual advice to cater towards your age a bit, but the general rule still applies. 

If you want to date her, then you need to ask her out straight up. There won't really be any ""perfect"" time to do so either, and I always tell people that the perfect opportunity is any opportunity. But, seeing how exams affect everyone's mood, in this instance, perhaps after exams are over is a good idea. 

Secondly, it'll only be awkward if you make things awkward. So *if* she says no for whatever reason and just wants to be friends, just say something like ""Ya, I can respect that"" and then change the subject. And the next time you're with a same group of friends, just behave normally as if you didn't ask her out. So joke as you normally do; talk as you normally; just do what you normally do. Don't act weird/awkward and avoid her. "

As a woman, you get the sense that men's willingness to hit on you may or may not have anything to do with how attractive you are. For example, men will avoid hitting on an incredibly attractive woman because he's shy or he doesn't think he'd have a chance.

&gt;You are literally the most annoying, negative, and defeatist person on this sub and you have no business trying to give other people ""advice"" because it's shitty and all you do is make people focus on the ""bad"" (their height, according to you.)

This is really confusing to me.  I'm sorry to hear that you feel that way.  I guess it's the opposite for me.  It's when I learned about heightism that I realized that the people who viewed short stature as a ""bad"" thing were in the wrong.  I think that knowing about heightism is empowering, and yet you find it depressing for some reason.  I don't really understand your point of view, I must admit.  

&gt;You're the type of person who thinks...

You don't know me.  And now you purport to know my mind?  This is insane.  

&gt;oh I didn't get the job because ""HEIGHTISM!"" that girl didn't like me because of ""HEIGHTISM!"" society thinks I'm literally the worst human being around because of ""HEIGHTISM!"" ""it's society's fault!

&gt;There's nothing wrong with me, it's society!

I have flaws.  But height isn't one of them.  I'll never include my height as a flaw.  

&gt;And then you pull out the ""exposing heightism"" Twitter page...

I think you're confusing me with someone else.  I bet it's been six months since I post a link to that site.  I'm the guy who says that height requirements in dating is NOT heightism.  

&gt;I bet you a million bucks you have that as your home page so you can get your daily dose of rage to fuel your self righteous essays that you type up in every thread because you're a self proclaimed expert. 

This is really amazing.  Why are you so angry right now?

&gt;Literally half of these people didn't even know what ""heightism"" was, and you know what? They were pretty ok, ....

No.  That's not O.K.  It's not O.K. to think that you've done something wrong because you were born to be short.  It's not O.K. to accept social discrimination because others have told you that ""it's no big deal"" or ""it's just a joke"" or that heightism is somehow the exception.  

&gt;because everybody has things that they are ""discriminated"" against.

Not really.  There is a difference between individual taste and systemic discrimination.  Heightism is an example of a systemic prejudice.  A prejudice which is encouraged as part of our cultural zeitgeist.  Yes, someone may be teased because they have a ""big nose"", but there is no cultural understanding that ""big nosed people"" are inferior.  That's the difference.  

&gt; You gave them this bullshit scapegoat to go focus on and made them feel bad about it.

jackiebird,agnostic,1390343299.0,"1) I never really involved god in the thought process behind that.  Like I always thought of it just as, ""why do bad things happen to good people?"" while never thinking about god having a direct involvement.  I was always taught that god's only real role was put your soul into your body when you were born and then to judge you when you died, not to make or let good or bad things happen to you in life.  Things would just happen and however you reacted to it would be what you were judged on.  Like, say there's an earthquake.  God makes the earthquake happen, but I don't think he'd worry about when or why or anything like that (I always thought it was arrogant of people who are having a bad time and they say things like, ""god's just testing me,"" because it's like, who are you?  You're one out of billions of people and you think god is setting aside time and energy to give YOU a rough day?  The ego there is crazy).  Remember that the lifespan of a human is hardly a blip on the radar to someone who's been around as long as god.  I think he'd just say, ""on this day there will be an earthquake,"" and leave it at that.  Now comes you.  You and your neighbors' homes have been destroyed, maybe even a huge portion of your state or country.  Someone you love may have been killed.  How do you react?  Do you try to help rebuild, make sure everyone has food, water and medicine?  Or do you loot and steal food and hurt others for your own gain?  That's what you're judged on.  And that's all god involves himself with.  He's like the quality control guy in a manufacturing plant; he doesn't handle the process of actually making you, he just looks you over at the end and decides if you're good to go to be delivered where you need to be, or if you're defective and need to be sent to the incinerator.  Sorry this answer is so long but it's a pretty big question to think about.  I'll try to keep the other answers shorter.

2) It doesn't really do to have someone just tell you, ""hey, god exists.""  If that worked, I'd believe it by now.  I think that there'd have to be something big, like words appearing in the sky, or a voice out of the clouds that say, ""I'm god and I exist!"" or him actually appearing before mankind.

3) I'm not really sure how I'd benefit.  I'd probably hate it, actually, because I'm a bit of a control freak and I hate the idea of not having power over my own life.  On one hand I'd probably be able to relax and say, ""Don't worry, god's taking care of me,"" but on the other I'd be saying, ""I can take care of MYSELF, dammit!""

4) Not that often.  Not independently, anyway.  I have friends and family who are religious, or if the topic of religion comes up somewhere I'll talk about it.  But I don't tend to think of it on my own."

I'm not really interested in the Pagani or the Veyron. I've not driven or ridden in either, though I've been in and around them.  They're kind of poser cars, expensively crafted bespoke fabrige eggs for people with too much money.  There are better and more interesting cars to buy for the money if you're into cars. They may be brutally fast in a straight line, but almost useable in any real world application.  If you just want to go fast, you can go that fast for less money. 

When I was at The Quail in 2009, someone explained to me why no one was even looking at the Veyron on display. They said anyone could own that car, you just had to walk down to Bugatti and give them a couple million dollars and they'll build it.  But all it says is ""I have money"" and everyone there isn't impressed with that statement.  People want to see something that actually means something. 

It would be kind of like seeing an original Thomas Kinkaid painting in someone's home. It was probably very expensive and a curiosity in its own way, but it's obvious the owner knows nothing about art and bought it as a status symbol. "

Cars subsidize metro costs in DC, without them being affordable, your metro train and bus fares would skyrocket... So would the price of rental cars and gas, which is already alarmingly taxed. If you give up the freedom to have a car in DC, you're committing to a life of monopolistic transportation costs from the providers of that transportation and it will get miserable, while the rich CEOs drive along next to you in their Bentleys.

Through a series of job changes, learning more, and networking with the right people, I'm now making more than double what I did.

The biggest things I can recommend is make friends in the industry, be it through vendors, colleagues, freelance jobs, etc.  Who you know will help immensely with landing higher paying jobs.  The other part is don't be afraid of jumping companies.  In IT, it is very difficult to get your current company to pay you more for skills you developed while working for them.  On average, 2 years is about as long as people usually stay at a particular position in IT.    Even after you get a new job, keep your eyes open.  You never know when a golden opportunity will present itself.

* My rabbi and the choir. I've been directed by the choral director for the past 13 years and she is, at this point, closer to me than one of my grandmothers. My rabbi is excellent, but he's only been with us for 2 years and will be moving back to Israel in the summer. After the summer I think I will be moving too. Thanks for the thread, actually, I'm thinking of coming to work in the states for a year and now I can start to build up an idea of cities I might like to live in with respect to Jewish options.

&gt;Communal religious affiliation? (e.g. ""This is a modern orthodox community"", just so I can further understand the different needs and attractions of the different branches of Judaism).

* Part of the MRJ, which I feel is more closely related to the Conservative US movement than to the URJ.

icepyrox,AskReddit,1390343544.0,"I think there are two things at play:

1) In America we try to melt all those differences together and make an ""American"" culture. A lot of differences are simply what ""American"" means. It seems less because everyone excuses or hides differences (or bullies everyone else into it), but yeah. I'm constantly amazed just living in California at the differences between areas in California.

2) How different is a culture under common laws speaking a common language? I haven't lived in Europe, so maybe I don't know, but most of what I see as ""cultural diversity"" hinges on ""I speak a different language"" or simply ""I'm French, therefore I will do things the French way"". At least, as much as that laughable American diversity."

If this is your goal, I'm afraid to tell you that this isn't going to happen. Everything you said so far leads me to believe she's just being courteous, especially if you both are still young. 

If you want to just be friends, you need to give her (and you) time to cool off. A break up is fresh and a break up is hard. In order to reach that level of being strictly platonic, you both need to go your separate ways and do your separate things for a while. How long is something that I can't say. (For me it was 6 months before I could be friends with my ex and even then we only hang out sporadically).

Stop saying you were 'always there for her' when you say a few lines above that you just stopped bothering to contact her. You were controlling and expected her to only talk to people you agreed with and only spend time with them and family, while you ran around hanging out with new friends and crushes and not bothering to get in touch.

She isn't going to take you back and it has nothing to do with some guy she 'friendzoned'.

This shouldn't happen.  He may find you unattractive, but that doesn't mean that you are unattractive.  Don't base your opinion of yourself solely based on what he thinks.  Yes, it's important for a relationship, and if he's no longer attracted, then your choices are either to change (if you consider that reasonable, especially if you changed something to cause him to no longer be attracted), or to leave him and find someone who does find you attractive.

And regardless of if it's ""normal"" or not, if you aren't happy, then leave. There are guys that I'm sure would be happy to have sex with you that you'd be compatible with.  Be with them instead.  Don't be miserable just because you like *most* of his qualities but can't stand others."

here's two things to think about:

1: cis people don't wonder 'am i trans?' this is a mistake a lot of trans people make. they think, well, everyone wishes they could be the opposite gender, right? and for the most part, no. no they don't. cis people don't even think about that. sometimes the questions will come up in like, a party game or something. 'what would you do if you woke up in the body of the opposite sex one day?' most cis guys would say, 'i'd play with my boobs all day!' and cis girls say 'i'd beat stuff up/jerk off all day'. but if your answer is cry tears of joy and relief and not worry about it anymore...yer prolly trans.

2: sorta the same but, 'the magic wand' question really helped me. which is, 'if someone presented you with a magic wand, and it's only power was that it would change your body to the opposite sex, you can only use it once. you'll be an attractive member of the sex you're currently not. no going back. would you use it?'' if your answer is yes, absolutely, in a heartbeat [as mine was[, you're prolly trans and you're afraid of the social pressure and danger and financial undertaking that is transition. [like i was]

so. i mean. what it really boils down to is, if you weren't afraid, would you transition? if yes, go for it! don't make decisions based on fear! if no, perhaps you have other things going on in your life, perhaps you're some other part of the gender spectrum. perhaps you're trans and transition isn't for you. only you can say. it's hard to figure out what's going on inside ourselves. but just continue thinking about it. make a decision based on what you really want, not on what you think you're supposed to want.

codayus,NeutralPolitics,1390343776.0,"&gt; I'm going to have to dispute your claim that only a tiny fraction of workers receive the minimum wage

According to BLS, in 2012 1.25% of total workers made the federal minimum wage.  ([Cite](http://www.bls.gov/cps/minwage2012.htm))

&gt; or less and don't receive tips.

I'm not entirely sure what you're saying here.  If you work for tips, then minimum wage laws (broadly speaking) don't apply to you, and you may (and generally do) have an hourly wage below minimum wage.  On the other hand minimum wage laws don't apply to you so an increase won't help you.  Such people are pretty much entirely tangential to any debate about raising the minimum wage.

Now, the real question is how many people make just above minimum wage, and would be impacted by a moderate increase.  :)  Sadly, I don't have data on that."

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390343781.0,"&gt; Let's look at another example: imagine I don't particularly like women with big noses. Then I meet this women who's perfect for me in every other sense, and I fall in love with her. But she happens to have a quite large nose. Would it be normal to reject her just for her nose, disregarding everything else? Wouldn't all the other positive traits that I find in her outweight her nose?

It wouldn't be ""normal"", but that tells us nothing about ""right"" or ""wrong"".  

&gt;Bear in mind that I'm not talking about the ""dating process"" that there seems to exist in the US and that is a bit alien to me. If you are blind dating someone or someone asks you out on a date, then it would be normal and logical to reject them if they have one trait you don't like. But in my examples I had in mind the relationship between people who already know each other (friends, co-workers, whatever). 

It's still has to be O.K. to reject anyone for any reason.  What other rule could we create?  A rule in which people are forced to be intimate with people whom they don't want to be intimate with if the reason ""isn't good enough"".  Can you see why such a rule would be immoral?"

And if that means no more sleeping, then so be it. That's what I did and after a full week of not sleeping, my wife learned how to use her powers while sleeping.

In that time I have removed over 400posts for not following subreddit guidelines. In addition to my moderation responsibilities I am one of the most active writers on knowyourmeme.com. You think I don't know memes? Then how do I write articles about them on a site called knowyourmeme? Several mainstream blogs have contacted me to ask about the recent meme phenomenon and each has been thankful and enlightened with what I had to tell them. It's not just limited to blogs though. Several companies have asked me to review their meme ads to avoid a failure like Toyota's meme commercial. Just last week a major food company contacted me with a paid offer to help them on a new ad campaign. I declined when I researched the company and saw that they had contributed money to socially conservative groups.

1. He said he paid $600 to get prescription lenses put in. What? Even at lenscrafters I can get that done for less, and yes, that involves putting them on other frames (e.g. Glass)
2. He didn't understand why they wouldn't tell his wife what was going on, while also hearing from them that they wanted him to rat out ""the man above him"". Yes, yes, the organized criminals spending $1500 on Glass just to steal movies, poorly? Also, Prisoner's Dilemma. They were trying to get your wife to rat you out.
3. You don't have a second pair of glasses? You wear your $1500 glasses everywhere and don't have a ""beater"" pair? Goggles4U can send you one for under $25, Coastal can do it for free if it's your first pair (I'm still on my free first pair three years later, which amazes me still.)
4. He has no idea what his rights are, but he also doesn't understand how pointing a camera at a movie screen even off looks super suspicious. I don't even let my phone's camera aim at the screen during the trailers. Even if I'm the only one in the theater (and I often am, odd how late shows during weekdays get nobody...), I know that they use retroreflector detection ([old article](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/magazine/11ideas1-3.html)) to see if there are any camera lenses and use that to alert authorities. They saw his camera lens. They automatically alerted authorities.  It's called [PirateEye](https://torrentfreak.com/movie-spy-cameras-attack-the-dying-art-of-camcorder-piracy-120426/).

So... lol? I know it sounds mean, but I don't see how this is /r/libertarian material. The theater is private property. They can refuse service to anyone. It's stupid that it took 3 movies for them to say something, it's stupid that they didn't say something beforehand, but he talked to the kids making minimum wage, NOT the management, so of course they didn't see a problem with it."

Khatib,tall,1390344113.0,"I'd probably aim for something like Indochino or one of many other made to measure sites if I were you, although if you're a slender guy, you might be able to make off the rack stuff work with a tailoring job.

I tried to get a suit off the rack a few weeks ago, knowing I'd just have to get it tailored a bunch, and the pockets would end up halfway to my kidneys, but fuck it -- I'm 31, I should own a damn suit by now. (Office is a business casual engineering/architecture firm, never needed one for work.)

Anyways, long story short -- the sales guy wouldn't even sell it to me after pinning the coat up and talking to their tailor about it for a bit.  An athletic cut is an 8 inch difference between coat size and waist size.  A ""super athletic"" cut is a 10 inch difference.  I need a 54XXL coat and a 38 waist.  16 inch difference.  No way to do it without pretty much ripping the coat apart to take that much out, which is then like $200 in tailoring fees, a less than stellar end result after taking that much fabric out of the body... and the tailoring fees on top of the coat price... I might as well drop $750 for a fully bespoke jacket.

I'm actually scared even to send in measurements to an online site because they'll be so weird that even like ""made to measure"" might have all kinds of weird bunching and folding and look like shit.  So I'm kind of just waiting until I have my weight fully settled (trying to lose a little more) and then paying about $1300 for a 3 piece bespoke suit from the aforementioned haberdashery.

Ugh.  What I wouldn't give to be able to go drop $150 at a random department store to get something that looks halfass decent to go get wasted in on NYE or after a good friend's wedding or whatever.  If I dump over a grand on a suit, I'm almost gonna be too scared to wear it out anywhere I know myself or my friends will be drunk by the end of the night."

ebonlance,TiADiscussion,1390344253.0,"It's mostly because STEM degrees are (more or less) inherently practical and are a decent investment of time and tuition money, whereas liberal arts fields generally aren't. Add to that the fact that ridiculous postmodernist circlejerks don't really happen in science fields - in fact, they're not even tolerated. 

A STEMinist is trained from the onset to cut through bullshit and rely only on objective facts to analyze situations and draw conclusions. In most liberal arts fields of study this isn't necessarily the case, so when the Women's Studies majors of the world rely on faulty stats and appeals to emotion and other stereotypical campus activist rhetorical techniques, it immediately sets off bullshit detectors and drastically lowers the STEMinist's opinion of the person spouting said bullshit. Over time this becomes a statistically informed bias against liberal arts majors.

Add to that the low entry barrier and rampant grade inflation in many liberal arts departments, where a CS major working his ass off scrapes by with a 3.1 while his Eng Lit friends get 3.8s-3.9 for free-associating through papers - the resentment isn't entirely unearned. Watching liberal arts majors struggle through basic math courses to get their math prereqs done while you're easily acing your lit or philosophy requirements doesn't help the image either. 

A lot of this stuff has an empirical basis too. STEM departments have the highest attrition rates on most campuses, and most grade inflation studies demonstrate that liberal arts departments grade way more leniently. And it's no secret that STEM majors are way more likely to get hired and will earn way more than the average liberal arts majors.

Part of it is a circlejerk, part of it is the fable of the grasshopper and the ant, with the ant wondering why the fuck the grasshopper wasted his college days playing makebelieve, then complaining about how he can't find a job and whining about SJW bullshit on the internet."

And the reason she didn't want to go to your brother's party because family is intimidating. It's intimidating when you're dating someone and meeting their folks, and it's even more intimidating if you've only been on a few dates! Meeting friends is easy because you're all within the same age bracket and have things to talk about and can relate better, etc. 

I think you should take the initiative and set up a date for this weekend (she doesn't work on weekends right?). It'll show you being assertive and that's an attractive trait in a guy. 

But the next time you're with her, you need to show interest! Otherwise it'll just come off as you and her being friends. You call your time together a date, but you don't do anything that shows you're interested in *her* as more than just a friend. "

&gt;as a Progressive Jew I believe that the Torah was not dictated literally by God but was an attempt by the Jewish people at the time to codify what God wanted of them. Incidentally, that makes it even more wonderful because if it was God's own work you'd expect it to be good; but as it is, it's even more impressive!  How do we separate those parts which we identify with and those parts which we don't? Not as some people (not you, I know) would think by the ""can we be bothered to do this?"" technique, but by other standards which people can create for themselves because there is a great degree of personal autonomy. Myself, I tend to distinguish between rules and principles. Rules are very specific to circumstances, for example stoning a gluttonous child to death, whereas principles are values which imply a normative conclusion, for example 'remember you were slaves in Egypt'. Where a specific rule is a complete incompatible with an overarching principle, it seems safe to assume that that was something that the ancient Israelites notated that is not necessarily God's will – God would presumably not create a contradictory system. Classic example of this is, as you say, stoning gay people to death. That is patently incompatible with the overarching idea that all humans are made in the Divine image, one of the earliest, most important and most broadly applicable principles of Jewish law, and therefore it seems likely that the stoning thing was a 2,000 year old twist rather than part of God's plan."

People might argue against me saying cleaning the basement and dishes is what most kids are required to do. However, lets step back while looking closer.

Lets assume he borrowed it for a week and his interest would be to 1) clean the basement and 2) do the dishes for a week.

Basements vary in different shapes and sizes. Lets assume he lives in a 2,000 sq ft house with a 750 sq ft basement. It should take about 30 minutes.

Cleaning the dishes everyday for a week is a little bit easier. Lets assume by dishes Leo means the dinner dishes since this is common.

Lets also assume it's a 4 person household with 2 parents and 2 children. It would take about 20 minutes to hand wash or about 5 minutes to put into a ~~washing machine.~~ dishwasher.

Lets assume each hour worth to a human is *at least* $7.25 at the lowest minimum wage in the US.

Without ~~washing machine~~ dishwasher total:
30 minutes vacuuming + (20 minutes washing * 7 days) = 2.83 hours of total work or $20.5. **Which comes to an APR of about 1,250%**

With ~~washing machine~~ dishwasher  total:
30 minutes vacuuming + (5 minutes washing * 7 days) = 1.08 hours of total work or $7.83. **Which comes to an APR of about 500%**


**tl;dr** 500-1,250% APR loans blow.

I underestimated almost everything in the calculations so the true total should be much higher.

And then announced it would be a twerk-off.  The crowd (about 500 people btw) started going pretty nuts as soon as I got the dress off, but the MC almost dropped the mic when he finally turned around and saw it.

And yes, of course I won the damn twerk off.  I'm awesome!  Also helps to be wearing a fur jock strap with a racoon tail on the backside of it to shake around when you wiggle your ass. ;)

GeoffreyArnold,short,1390344761.0,"&gt; More, I don't think heightism exists in his own individuality, or at least it doesn't have a relevant impact on his own. The greatest impact heightism can have in one's life it's believing it can affect you.

Is this true of other things, or just heightism?  So, ""the greatest impact _____ can have in one's life is believing it can affect you"".  Fill in the blank with something besides ""heightism"" so I can better understand what you mean here.   

&gt;I think your fight, heightism, it's part of something much greater that not only includes short guys but every person that doesn't fit in a ideal image that society worships, shall that person be short, ugly, fat, disabled, transexual, etc. 

But heightism is not a prejudice based in beauty norms...it's based in gender norms.  If you were right, it would affect both men and women equally.  So, ""ugly"" affects both men and women.  Disability affects both men and women.  Fat might be considered a gender norm also, but it has health implications where being short is perfectly healthy.  It really is a different category from all of these other things.  Plus, heightism is encouraged where ableism (for example) is generally frowned upon.  

&gt;You're having a selfish fight feeded up with nothing but your own problems, nothing but your own interests, and you're trying to destroy a single tree instead of burning the whole forest down.

what are you subscribed to?

&gt;This is just politics for most people

When you won't be able to afford heating your house and food in the same month, you don't talk about politics. This is about a bureaucratic ruling class that sacrifices progress and their citizens well being because they don't want to lose power. A generation X and Y that refuses to shut up and take the status quo, because they know what could be. 

I suppose you could extend the meaning of poliitics, to reframe it in a historical, philosophic and social context so this would qualify as politics, but in that case these movements not only qualify as real politics, but because they are real paradigm shifts that define generations and change the future of nations are more ""political"" than any of our democratic pseudointelectual rhetoric carried out by wealthy politicians and moderated by sensationalist journalists. All of our ""politics"" are pale, lack vigor, motive, they seem to be a charade, a puppet show interpreting the real thing, a lie we are satified with and accept as sufficient.

When your tires are skidding, they only have about 70% of their traction. Or, they only stop you 70% as good as full braking without sliding. ABS will lock up your brakes, and then release them. So you get 70-0-70-0-70-0-70-0 percent braking. They pulsate about 15 times/second. That's not really that good for stopping you, but it is good for control. If you can maintain your brakes at 90-95% of their maximum potential, before sliding, you will stop faster than ABS and still have control of the vehicle.

In west we don't have outdated customs like ancestor worship, that's why we don't get any penalties from our fathers crimes. Instead we have a progressive custom to leave good things for our children, because that is our job, to provide for family.

Any issue which is not more widely into the publlic conciousness, or anything which cannot be understood as common sense (and theres some pretty flawed stuff which is ""common sense"") is not going to get into the lead in the race with all the other more easily understood garbage.

So they're under the surface, because not everyone understands them, and if its not ""got"" straightaway, it will be less visible.

It will always be a better measure of what is ""got"", what does well on places like AA.

Against control. Board in your charms, you want them.  Depends kind of on the matchup, is it U/W or esper with Blood Barons?

You're right, that's a pretty amazing time.   ...but they only made 15 of them, they can't be used on the road or in any racing series, and are good for basically one thing: bragging about how fast it is on the 'ring.   Is it a street car?  Not really, you can't title it for street use.  Is it a race car?  Not really, it's not legal for any serious racing series where you might spend two million dollars on a race car. 

If you want to spend that kind of money on a car that can turn wickedly fast lap times, why not [buy Schumacher's old F1 car](http://msn.foxsports.com/speed/cars/cars-seven-figure-sales-dominate-super-saturday-at-barrett-jackson/)?  That's one that's likely to appreciate dramatically as time goes on as well.  

If you can afford that car or the Zonda R, you can probably afford [Ferrari's F1 Clienti Program](http://corseclienti.ferrari.com/2012en/championship-type/f1-clienti/) and go race real Ferrari F1 cars against other Ferrari F1 cars. 

If you'd only like to go that fast around the 'ring, why not buy a [Radical SR8 LM](http://www.supercars.net/cars/3838.html).  It's a second slower, which could easily be attributable to driver, conditions, or any number of other factors.  Either way, an amateur driver in either isn't going to be consistently faster in either one.  And, you can drive that one on the street, all for the ""low"" cost of $180k.  

It is fast, and it looks cool, and I might be open to changing my opinion on the Zonda R, but I still say it's not a usable car in any real sense of the world and isn't worth the money.   I have to admit that I saw ""Pagani Zonda"" and made a judgement from there not knowing the specifics on the R model. "

The compounding of social pressures, academics  and family ties are unbelievably complex as an adolescent male. There's also different, situational types of suicidal desires. I never would have actually killed myself, but I wanted to die, so I had ""suicidal ideation without intent"", it's a desire to utilize the only escape that he feels will really give him any help. If his desires are genuine, the issue is so much more complex than people often see suicide is.

I can tell you sometimes late at night, I wanted nothing more than to have someone hug me and tell me I would be okay. Then during the day I would push everyone around me away in disgust when they tried to care for me. My best suggestion is to tell him that you will do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. Don't try to suggest things to him, or push him to do anything, the last thing he probably wants is more pressure. It's virtually impossible to ""prompt"" him to work through his issues.  He will have to have professional help that can assist him in finding his own path. Even if he starts to take anti-depressants, it's a temporary solution to a deeper issue.

PLEASE, feel free to PM me if you have any questions, I can provide you with a perspective that is very likely similar to what your brother may be going through. It's also very hard on you to have this drastic and confusing of an issue in your life."

Formerly very sheltered girl homeschooled from Kindergarten through Grade 12 with a massive Manic Pixie Dream Girl complex who's still trying to get a handle on this whole shitshow. I am more mature for my age in many ways but I cannot adult yet.

Working an utterly worthless customer service position and staying up far later than is healthy. Trying to redirect my energy and attention towards things that are actually interesting and beneficial and just failing abysmally.


**I'm really good at**

And blowjobs. I am really fucking good at blowjobs.


**The first things people usually notice about me**
When I'm not wearing makeup people usually think I'm either tired or stoned all the time, partially because of the non-sleep-related lines around my eyes and partially because I usually am tired.


**Favourite books, movies, shows, music, and food**
A bunch of stuff, most of which I read/saw/watched months or years ago, but will still carry on a half-hearted conversation with you about because I don't want you to realize that all I do lately is browse Reddit.

**On a typical Friday night I am**

I assume that everyone is selfish, lacks empathy, and will ultimately let me down hard if I give them the chance. This way, I'm pleasantly surprised if they don't.

I try to contribute, or ""vote with my dollar"" (does the UK use such a phrase?) to the idea of good labor practices, and wages: 8 hour shifts with breaks, regular safety inspections, overtime, etc. I don't want to associate myself with Foxconn or Bangladeshi clothing factory fires.

amaurosisfugax,medicine,1390345227.0,"Registrar and Consultant are both terms used in countries where the teaching and postgraduate training of Doctors has been heavily influenced by the system in the UK. However, it's complicated slightly by the various country specific changes that have taken place over the years.

Traditionally, Consultant means a fully trained specialist physician or surgeon that is consulted by the patient on the referral by a general practitioner to advise on the disease-specific care of a patient. They run clinics, head teams of registrars and junior doctors, take ward rounds and usually have some research and management commitments. In the UK they are doctors that hold a Certificate of Completion of Training and are on the GMC's Specialist Register. Essentially they are the equivalent of Attendings in the US.

Registrars were traditionally Senior Trainee Doctors, typically the members of the team that everyone contacted on-call as a last resort before waking the consultant. They would see patients in the consultants clinic under their supervision, take ward rounds in the consultants absence and generally hold a membership of the relevant Royal College. I imagine they would roughly be equivalent to fellows. however, in recent years in the UK, the term Registrar has started to be used for doctors earlier on in their training, and so can be equivalent to senior Residents (where previously these doctors would have been called Senior House Officers).

General Practitioners are the only primary care doctors in the UK. Paeds, Gynae, and internal medicine are all Secondary Care specialties. Family medicine isn't really a distinct specialty in the UK. GP training is a 3 year course generally involving placements with a GP practice, as well as in-hospital experience of Emergency Medicine, Paediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Orthopaedics. Once they finish this, and complete their membership exams for the Royal College of General Practitioners. they get a certificate of completion of training and are added to the GMC's GP Register.

Before joining any specialty track, MBChB graduates are required to have satisfactorily completed the Two Year ""Foundation Programme"" which contains placements in hospital medicine and surgery. This first year of this is probably equivalent to MS4 in the US, as UK medical students have less of an active role in patient management than our US counterparts.

Finally, medical education in the UK has no USMLE and no real direct equivalent. There is no examination that will be sat by all medics at any point in their careers. The undergraduate curriculum is set by the GMC, which periodically inspects the medical schools to ensure that the full curriculum is being taught and that the final examinations are of a requisite standard. Graduates (MBChB) of a medical school validated by the GMC are entitled to apply for the Foundation Programme and for provisional GMC registration, which is upgraded to full registration after the completion of 1 year's practice without concerns.

Postgraduate specialist education and examination is coordinated by the Royal Colleges (Physicians, Surgeons, Child Health, General Practice, O&amp;G, etc). Membership of a particular royal college is usually a pre-requisite for advancement to training as a senior Specialty registrar, and is achieved by passing the practical and written exams set by that college."

awh444,teenagers,1390345409.0,"Generally I like to start off asking a question about homework or a class that I'm in with them. If that's not possible, talk about an event that's happening at your school, really anything that you'd both know about and be able to talk about. Ideally though, it's a class you're in together or for which you have the same teacher.

Start out asking basic questions that you can both talk about, but regarding that class/event you have in common, like, ""hey, what did you think of that quiz?"" or ""wow I'm so glad we finally finished that project!"". Once you've established conversation with her, things get easier.

After you start the conversation on something innocent like that, it will usually, almost inevitably, progress into more personal stuff about your life, your tastes, music/sports/family/food or whatever. If she likes you back, she'll absolutely carry on the conversation, even if it's about dumb stuff. And then you can always restart the conversation by mentioning the latest happening in that class you're in together, like ""did you do the homework tonight? I was confused"". Or something like that.

So that way, you can find out what she's like as a person, as well as get to talk to her! I know it sounds scary, but trust me and try it. Sending that first text is always intimidating, but if you build up the courage to do it, it could definitely pay off later."

I'm not sure I agree with that statement. Otherwise we wouldn't all have individual accounts and the ability to post what and how we wish (within reason). Who is answering on behalf of anyone, rather than themselves? Did we appoint these ambassadors/representatives? Vote on them?




&gt;When people ask questions, I assume they are asking about how the religion/culture/etc works currently, not what is most historically accurate. 

And for some users, this historical is also current. So it's not an issue of you for including the ""historical and also modern"" answer, but rather the exclusion of OTHER, ALSO modern answers. Which I and other non-Orthodox users can post.

&gt;Your answers might be ""historically true,"" but they are not representative of contemporary Judaism. 

This is tremendously unfair to our Orthodox brethren :/

Luffy is about as whole hearted as it gets, he only does things to help others and goes into every battle with the objective of winning for others, every time. He isn't as righteous about it either. Then you have zoro who is about as badass as Sasuke, but he doesn't want to kill his brother and village, he wants to be the best swordsman alive. His fights are awesome to watch since he is an absolute powerhouse. Then you have Sanji who is the cook and fights only using kicks, he is also a romantic and sucker.

If you get to know the instructors, they will often do their best to help you. A lot of intro college classes are easier than some high school classes, so just put in some effort. 

Use Ratemyprofessor.com when registering for classes. I still do.

While college isn't like all the American Pie type movies depict it as, it still is a lot of fun, you just have to be willing to break out of your comfort zone and meet new people and try everything.

themike314,SquaredCircle,1390345875.0,"I can see Punk lasting until the end.  Fantasy booking engaged:

When #30 is supposed to come out, no one does.  Cameras backstage show someone, doesn't really matter who, beaten up.  Announcers speculate that he was supposed to be the final participant.

Cut back to the arena, we see HHH storming to the ring.  He's taking off his tie and jacket.  He jumps into the match and eliminates Punk.  He screams, ""You weren't supposed to be in here this long!"" and whatnot.  HHH then turns around and figures out he might as well give it a go since he entered himself into the match.

We're down to the final four:  Batista, HHH, Wyatt and Bryan.  Batista and HHH sit back and let the other two go at it.  Bryan and Wyatt beat the hell out of each other, but then Bryan gets the upper hand and eliminates Bray.

HHH and Batista go to team up on Bryan, but Punk runs back in and attacks HHH and tosses him over the top rope.  They continue to fight on the outside as refs try to seperate them.

While this scuffle goes on, Bryan eliminates Batista.  The refs were distracted by the fight and didn't see it, so Batista jumps back in and tosses Bryan.  Of course, the refs see this and declare Batista the winner.  The crowd is probably chanting NO! at this point.

Not so fast!  Kane comes out and restarts the match!  The Punk/HHH fight has been broken up and now we have Batista vs Bryan to finish out the Rumble.  Batista gets all cocky and arrogant.  Bryan starts a YES! chant and the crowd goes nuts.  They scuffle for a little bit, with Bryan eventually hitting THE KNEE and knocking Dave over the top rope.

The entire crowd wets themselves in excitement.

Orton, still champion, comes to the ring and he and Bryan face off with the Mania sign in view behind them (like they do).  Orton becomes more and more agitated.  Rumble goes off the air with a never-ending YES! chant."

also, dysphoria can come in waves. you can go a few months and be sorta fine. you don't think about it. you throw away your girl clothes, or whatever and you think you're over it. then it comes back and you find yourself hurting even more. that's a more common narrative in my experience.

Some of the older animators may have never done anything but animate as they transitioned from 2d to 3d.

To summarize, the difference between Cognitive Science and Symbolic systems is the approach.  Cognitive Science emphasizes the mind and its processes - the strategies/structures thinking things use to understand/learn/process information; e.g., how do we know, as a species, that when we point towards a rabbit and say ""rabbit"", we refer to the whole rabbit and not just the ears of the rabbit.

Symbolic systems is more about the symbols, how the thinking things use them, and the things that use them.  The thinking things (agents as per the article) can be human, animals, even computers; e.g., how might we program a computer to perceive a rabbit as a whole object (as opposed to parts of the rabbit) so that when someone uploads a picture of a rabbit to the computer to be recognized (without user-tabs), the computer can say ""that's a brown rabbit with long ears and fuzzy whiskers"" and that ""most humans between the ages of 5 to 45 will find it cute.""


Symbolic systems can incorporate methods from cognitive science and vice versa.

vladesko,Anthropology,1390346184.0,"I'm on my phone, so I can't give a proper answer, but Takie Sugiyama Lebra, on her book ""Japanese Patterns of Behavior"", argues that, because the Japanese have such emphasis on hierarchy and ""knowing your place"", they have almost no sibling rivalry (compared to westerners, I guess). Instead, they have some sort of (let's call it) ""mutual cooperation"" between the older brother (aniki) and the younger brother (otōto). 

This ""mutual cooperation"" works like this: the older brother has a duty to protect (and sometimes spoil) the younger one. Who, in his turn, has to respect (or obey) the older one. And she argues that this relationship is mirrored in most Japanese organizations, like schools or companies (*senpai-kōhai* relationships) or even the Yakuza itself, that mirrors the *ie* (household) so well that the boss is called *oyabun* (dad).

And, somewhat relevant, on the other side of the world, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro has an article where he says that, on some Amazonian tribes, all the usual relationships that we westerners have with our siblings (like rivalry and proximity) they have with their brothers-in-law. I don't know how siblings act to each other though, but I guess it must be different from us.

Max_Insanity,whowouldwin,1390346226.0,"Neglecting the fact mentioned by /u/AreYouReadyToReddit that Joker wouldn't be physiologically able to fly a tie fighter, he is undoubtably a better pilot. Wash was just found on some random planet, we don't even have someone to compare him to. When you consider how Joker got his name, that alone should tell you enough to know who of the two will win a piloting contest.

The reason was, he never smiled during training, he was obsessed with improving his skills and showing everyone what he was made of and he succeeded. That is the reason why he got to fly *the* most technologically advanced ship of the entire Alliance fleet, which he in turn navigated safely through several battles, in which the Normandy destroyed a collector ship so much larger than itself, that it fell into a completely different size category (Normandy - frigate; Collector Ship - cruiser?). He flew through a debris field at high speeds that probably no one else could have navigated and was such a good pilot that even an AI, so intelligent and capable that it was self aware and of human-level intelligence (at least), couldn't perform better on its own than with him at its side.

So you have possibly humanities best pilot compared to a guy randomly picked up on some random planet who get the ship nearly destroyed in one of the two space battles he was ever seen in on screen (if I recall correctly). In the other one, he just fled.

Now don't get me wrong, I have a lot of love for Wash's character and think he was a great pilot, but the two simply do not compare."

Malcolm_Sex,INTP,1390346412.0,"The only ISTP I know is pretty immature, so take my experience with a grain of salt, because I'm very critical of him.

He's a friend, but he's very shallow.  He takes the typical bro mentality with women, and he seems to find it impossible to be *just friends* with the opposite sex - not that it evolves into sexual tension, but worse: there's always an ulterior motive.  He's also very bad with money, because he's impulsive and craves ""things"".  Whether it's drugs, drug paraphernalia, videogames, clothes, electronics, or food.  He takes the concept of ""living in the moment"" to a whole new level, and as a result he's very anti-authoritarian and bases his worth on his achievements;  he'll always send you a picture of his latest accomplishment or purchase.  He's a terrible debater, because he has to get the last word in, but that last word is always ""that's just how it is"".  Sometimes facts but never theory.

On the flip side, he knows how to fix pretty much any object.  He has very detail-oriented, practical knowledge in a blue-collar, manual labor type of way.  And he's better at sports than I could ever hope to be.  He's also very [outwardly] level-headed, whereas I'm reactive and neurotic.  He's a very good listener, but I can't tell if he's actually interpreting information or just storing it.  At times, he's also one of the best empaths I know.

He's very loyal but is very deeply hurt and angry when someone betrays him, because he has fixed and rigid expectations.

Dharmasabitch,polandball,1390346420.0,"I'm not trying to factually explain anything, as I said ""I heard..."" so I'm just answering a question you directed at me. If you want a good answer, google it. That said, I'll elaborate on my shitty answer: a lot of diseases, including small pox, fucked up the Europeans in the ~1000 years before their arrival in the New World. The specific diseases are somewhat besides the point, though. The immune system gets good at combating disease once it is presented with it, so resistance to a specific disease is not genetically heritable (when children are in the womb, they inherit some antibodies, but unless they encounter the disease again later they will not pass them on). However, having a good immune system is quite probably a very heritable, genetically-based trait. Therefore, the real phenotype that survived in Europe was not ""resistance to small pox and black plague"", it was ""improved ability to form resistance to any disease."" Therefore, it does not matter what disease they encountered in the New World, the European population was naturally better at building a resistance to it.

This is not something I specifically remember reading (could have been in *1491*, or from readings from school, or my head), and I have no citations, but I study evolutionary biology and have taken an Anthropology course on North American Indians. It's not a real source, just my interpretation based on what I know."

Besides, the Europeans went to the Americas, not the other way around. So even if there was a bad native disease, it wouldnt get the chance to work its way over the pond.

SenseiCAY,dating_advice,1390346572.0,"A death isn't the same as a breakup because there isn't any closure to the relationship. Usually, when a breakup happens, both parties are sort of aware that it's going to happen, and no one is truly blindsided. When one person is blindsided (as was the case for one of my relationships), at least they could let out their thoughts to me at some point (we talked and while I didn't change my mind about breaking up, she got some closure out of it). In the case of a death, the surviving half of the relationship never gets that closure, and the wound can take a long time to heal. What he does to help himself is up to him, but it's likely that he'll carry a piece of his ex-girlfriend with him for a long time.

I'd tread lightly, but if you're interested, then I'd give him a chance. If he says that he's ready for a new relationship, take his word for it. If he truly isn't ready, it'll show itself pretty quickly. You don't have to jump into this so quickly. Date him, get a feel for where he is, and then go from there. If his actions say that he isn't ready, in **your** opinion, then don't continue. In the end, it's **your** dating life and what is acceptable to you is your choice."

HomelessPandas,SuicideWatch,1390346886.0,"1) You said people ""look so happy"". In the Facebook Generation, superficiality has skyrocketed. So many people have this driving motivation to showcase how the happy parts of their life, so that everyone else thinks their life is great. It's amazing how much this has effected me in my life. But every one of those sexy little shallow slutty barbie girls that won't give you a second thought because you don't have raging biceps isn't happy. I promise you that. She may be hammered every night getting attention from ten different guys, but virtually everyone is insecure in some way, and quite often, unhappy. Some are just much better at burying/ignoring their emotions and demons.

2)My sophomore year of college i was in the exact same place, I fell into a dysfunctional shitty routine of making poor choices and being cyclically wasteful and unproductive for no reason, and hating those choices. It may sound harsh, but a lot of that has to come from you. Nobody can give you a purpose for your life, you have to go out and break the cycle. It sounds cliche and lame as fuck, but carpe diem. You never know when you are going to have some stimulating experience. I make a point to make a random choice to do something unique every day to break the monotony. Go walk down the street and talk to a hobo. Something off the wall like that. Challenge your own worldview. It's amazing what you can find when you put yourself out in the world. It's so easy to shut yourself away, especially in this day and age.

3) Yes, it does get better. High School is bullshit. Honestly, nobody knows what they're doing, everyone is insecure and figuring themselves out. College is more of the same, especially freshman year. But you will be blown away by how much everyone you know changes. It's bizarre. You just can't give up. You have to remember that life is continuum, always changing and evolving, and will never be in the same place as it was. You can be as involved or uninvolved with your life path as you want. 

I've been exactly where you've been, and trust me, you are your own worst enemy at times. Good luck my friend.

There are myriad other things I could do on sunday, but I watch football because I find it more entertaining than the alternatives. 

I hate U2. Bono's an insufferable ass and their music is stale. You know what I do? I don't listen to them, and I Damn sure don't go to their concerts. You know what I don't do? I don't go to reddit threads about U2 and bitch about how their concerts gum up traffic and spawn hordes of pretentious shitbags onto the streets, or how a personal trainer at my gym likes to play elevation every Damn day for his class, and it echoes through the whole building. I don't bitch about how hempfest spawns a thousand drugged out zombies who wander the streets and make every bus reek like a skunk that's been rolled in it's own shit and then lit on fire. I don't bitch about bumbershoot and the insufferable noise pollution of shitty banjos trying to impress some exec in the crowd so they can sell out.

This is his draft year, and is on the USNDT, which yes plays in the USHL but plays a marginal amount of their games there. The U17 gets a bulk of the USHL action. They play 28 USHL games, while the U17 gets the rest. Most of the games the U18 team plays is against colleges and international tournaments. If he was on a random USHL team I guarantee he wouldn't be ready. I can't remember the last non-team USA player from the league to go directly to the NHL the next year. Trust me, I Love the USHL, I have a team thats about a mile away from me that I've supported my entire life, but its not a fast track league. Its a great development league. To me its the ideal league for anyone under 18 to join, who hasn't been drafted, who isn't a for sure generational talent. Those kids don't really need a college education, most of us do. And the ones who are really good and drafted high who play in this league who end up going to college immediately at 18 (Kyle Okposo, for instance) realize after a year or so of college they are mature and ready for the NHL.



Eichel will not make an NHL roster in fall of 2014, and even if he tried to I dont think he would. The kid is good, don't get me wrong. He'll be playing NHL until he is 38 unless something happens to him, however, he wont be ready in 8 months. There are only a handful of kids that are NHL ready at age 18. Basically unless hes a top 10 pick playing the next year in the NHL isn't going to happen. Its a rare thing to be outside that and play immediately. For instance, Jonathan Drouin, 3rd overall pick, got cut and is back in the Q.


Each have their own perks and benefits, I myself if I was playing at 16 or had a kid that age, I would want them to go to the USHL, unless they have been a dominate player for the last couple years at his age group, and doing exceptionally well for himself playing up against bigger kids. (IE someone who probably is going to get drafted top 10). The rest of the time - I'd go to the USHL, play 2 years there then head to college. If hes ready after a year or so of college then he leaves, if hes not ready then have him stick it out, get that degree, then pursue the dream."

You're welcome for the analogy. Now that I know your sole definition of capitalist is ""exchanging goods or services for some medium of exchange"" equals capitalist, I think we can stop debating. 

As I said, every person and sovereign in existence for several thousand years falls into your definition of capitalist, so its settled. You ignore every facet of capitalism except ""buying and selling"", which takes place in virtually every economic model.

You as a single person cannot end all evil in the world, rather it's the actions of individuals, like you, in their community that can make all the difference. It's the most I can do most days. Do your best to spread good. When you objectively look at the world, you can see the evil and the selfishness, but you can empathize as well. You can see all the struggle, the strength and wonder that humans are capable of. It's this potential for greatness, even if it just comes in the form of changing ONE persons life, that makes life worth living.

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390347756.0,"I know East Asians tend to be more blunt about socioeconomics (right or wrong), and we can hear it all the time if when we go to Asia enough, because they often live with their parents. You end up swapping spit through dinner and like a lot of older people they don't hold back with opinions. I have an idea of the point you're trying to make, but we'll get sidetracked. 

We can cut it short. If you want to say hypergamy isn't *that* big of a deal in the West, I can agree. If you want to say most people marry within their own socioeconomic class, I'll agree to that even when applied to Asia. I also understand that there might be some matriarchal societies today and in the past that I'm not as familiar with where marital socioeconomic mobility happens more often with men than women. I understand that there are historical context to consider. 

That all is irrelevant to this specific topic which I *am* familiar with. This idea that somehow this problem is primarily the fault of ""conservative, traditional Chinese men"". 

It borders on the stereotype of the literally-white knight coming to save Asian women who are oppressed by their patriarchal societies that gets repeated by both bluepillers and redpillers too often because it has elements that appeal to both groups… but it is just wrong.

I'm not saying that it's wrong for the women to do this. I am just saying the stereotype is flat-out wrong.

These women are most often not helpless. They have agency. No, it's not ""traditional/old-fashioned attitudes"" of men that are keeping them single. It is mostly by their own choice. To use Social Justice^^™ terms, they have real *privilege*.

It is by their own choice that they insult busboys in the midst of dinner/lunch conversations as they are serving groups I'm with. It is by their choice to distrust the poor to the point where some would tell me that crippled beggars are actually talented contortionists. It is all by their own choice that over 90% of the male population is completely intolerable as options to them.

It is as /u/useitdontloseit says in [*this comment*](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1vqosy/trp_shows_its_financial_prowess_and_money_earning/cev4o2q). He/She can't even imagine a wealthier, more *privileged* woman marrying a rural man. I will go even further and say that successful Shanghai businesswomen I know personally won't even consider someone just slightly lower socioeconomically or even without Shanghai residence cards. 

The ones higher on the socioeconomic ladder have more power and options. The reason I think so many people forget that is the same reason rich people issues/problems get more attention than poor people ones."

huisme,whowouldwin,1390347831.0,"To start, if Robin knew he was going to have to fight someone he'd probably go with a sixty-100 pound longbow, plenty of cast and easy for him to use (the dude trains with 150+ pound bows). He'd probably have his sword, a dagger, and he'd definitely have access to rope, armor if he wanted it, and he's going to use a disguise if it's at all possible or fun for him.

I don't actually know that much about green arrow, but being a modern archer he'll probably use a 50-70 pound compound, which will have greater cast than Robin's bow but no other useful advantages, and a higher tendency to break in rough conditions if that's relevant. It seems like his big advantage would be exploding arrows, as Robin wouldn't think to jump away from the first arrow that missed him.

They're both physically strong, Robin is an expert swordsman and has the added strength of pulling/holding 150+ draw bows, they can both get around quickly especially in their 'native habitats,' and they're both very accurate with their bows.

I think this comes down to who sees who first, unless Oliver has the misfortune of running into Robin in close quarters in which case Robin throws him around the room before cleaving him in half, or Robin dicks around and gets blown up by one of Oliver's 'missed shots.'

5/5

I think Oliver's technical advantages are pretty even with Robin's physical advantages.

Edit: I meant to say compound for Oliver. I know he also uses recurves and flatbows (which are actually both flatbows, but I won't get into that), but compounds give him the greatest ability to match Robin's war bow so long as durability isn't a major factor."

nappythrill22,49ers,1390347924.0,"I think Bruce Miller's absence was felt in the last few weeks. He does a great job of sealing LBs at the second level, so that Frank can get loose in the backfield, where DBs are either intimidated by his power and let him bowl over them, or they sell out on the tackle, and he bounces around them. He is not as fast as he once was, but he was never a track star. He has always been an elusive power back.

I think part of what we lost with Alex leaving is the check down/screen game. He ran it for so long with Frank, that both were masters at it. Colin almost never does this. IDK if that's his fault, Romans, Jim's, or a combo of the three, but LMJ proved in college that he excels at that type of play (Hunter can run it well too), so I would like to see more of that against Ds like Seattle, Carolina, NOLA, etc. who love to sell out in the middle. The reason off tackle runs don't work even though they're selling out between that hashes is they have the speed (like our D) to beat most teams to the edge and hold containment. We seldom take advantage of that. Against the panthers, we picked on their inferior CBs and Safeties, opening up the rest of the field for short passes and runs.

Seattle aint gonna buy that unless we can prove that they need to defend it. Run some screens, or RB option routes and let this squad of backs do what they do best, which is make moves in the open field. Look at how small Jamaal Charles is. He gets with Alex, and has a career year doing just that. We can totally do this.

One caveat: For all of Colin's talents, he hasn't developed *touch*. He has always been able to drive a bullet or a deep pass, but between his ungodly long unload time (long arms), and lack of finesse, he will have a hard time in the screen game. If however he can learn to shorten his throwing motion in certain situations, he will be deadly, and an MVP candidate.

As an example, on the first pick (intended for Boldin I believe) and the reception by Crab on the *same play*, both times Colin had space to loft one between the CB and the SS. Both times he tried to fit a quick pass over the head of the CB/LB. Once it worked, and once it got picked. Had he tried to lead his WR between coverage there was more than enough room for a catch and then some."

To be honest, the lack of transparency around the whole issue, combined with a policy that I feel is designed to de-humanise vulnerable people to win political points raises a heap more issues than the roughing up of a boatload of people.

Max_Insanity,Pathfinder_RPG,1390348107.0,"Have you checked out Treantmonks guide for Wizard and Sorcerer yet? They are very enlightening, although I don't think he gives enough credit to the damage dealing capabilities of the sorcerer/wizard class.

It is pretty useful to follow his advice on the wizard but with the sorcerer, you can have sooo many spells per day that you can actively spam the heavy hitting rays (like scorching ray - 2nd level). As a wizard, you can't do both damage and utility, as a sorcerer, you can't learn a great deal of spells. Both things have their place. For first level, if you want utility, have him learn enlarge or reduce person, as well as mage armor or shield, since he can spam it more often to benefit people in the party. You can take something different meanwhile.

I have spent a great deal of time comparing both classes, creating characters just for the heck of it etc. and I have to legitimately say that it makes no reason for the sorcerer to get his new spell levels one class level later than the wizard. It is simply not fair. Both are already balanced through the wizards versatility, the difference in spells per day being not all that big, as well as offset through the low amount of spells known by the sorcerer. Int and Cha not only balance each other out, with both having 2+int modifier skills, the wizard is at a clear advantage. You may want to talk to your GM about house ruling some things, for a better playing experience. I'll share what I'd do and you can choose which of these things you prefer:

**Here's the part you might want to show your GM:**

As GM, if someone in my group wished to play a sorcerer, I would give them:

* 4+Int skill points (seeing as they don't need to spend all day locked up studying and can actually *learn* stuff, as well as for balancing reasons) *or* d8 hit dice (same reason).

* Spell level progression like a wizard, most likely by giving access to the bloodline spells two levels earlier each. As it is, an arcane sorcerer could choose to get the ""dispel magic"" spell (3rd level) as soon as possible, which is character level 6 (as opposed to 5 for the wizard). However, this is a bonus spell for that bloodline, chosen because it seemed fitting to it. So he gets it at level 7 again (bonus bloodline spell) and may swap it at level 8 (if you don't interpret the rules literally in a sense that doesn't make any - I digress).

How convoluted and senseless. Just decrease the level for bonus spells by 2 and you get these advantages:

* The character gets access to a new level of spells at the same time as the wizard.

* He can cast spells befitting his bloodline earlier than other, equally powerful spells.

* He starts the game with 3 instead of 2 spells known - as opposed to the wizards, comparatively insanely unfair, 3 + Int number of spells.

**tl;dr:** People see the sorcerer as the weakest class in the game because it is, give him more skill or hit points and decrease the level for bonus spells by 2 and he will be on par with a wizard."

EtherBoo,insanity,1390348203.0,"&gt; Does any one have any tips on meal variations for people who aren't huge into vegetables...

There's no good answer for this.  Carl Diakeller (spelling?) claims he created Shakeology because he hates eating vegetables.  I used it for a while and it's good stuff, it's stupid expensive ($100 - $120 for a 30 day supply).  That's one route you can take.

The other is (tough love incoming), stop being a baby and just eat your damn vegetables.  Eating right means not every meal will be rich, heavy, and make Paula Deen's panties wet (oh God why did that come to mind?).  Some meals will be a bit bland and boring.  If you don't like your vegetables, eat them first before everything else.  

The good news about that plan is that your taste buds change every 2 weeks.  If you cut out all salt in your diet for 2-3 weeks, a potato chip will be so over salted you won't be able to grasp how you used to eat them.  I used to hate raw tomatoes, love 'em now.  Used to hate broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and a bunch of other veggies - I love them now.

Dig Deeper isn't just about pushing play and flailing your body around, it's a mental game about the whole package.  Your taste buds and mental blocks will eventually get used to the veggies and you'll want to eat more of them.  Unfortunately, getting past this is just as hard as Max Interval Circuit and Fit Test in the same day.  "

shadow1515,pharmacy,1390348410.0,"You are right. Unfortunately, the prescriber's office is often as hectic as ours if not more. There are some where you can tell they just have their office staff write out their scripts, then they sign them all in a row and send them out the door. This is not ideal, and while it might be fine if it's just a refill on something a patient has been taking that way for the past decade, it often leads to grievous errors that then take even more time because now we need to call and talk to the prescriber to sort it out. This happens so many times per day it's not even funny.

E-prescribing fixes some of this, but it introduces a whole slew of new issues when the doctor just clicks the first thing on a list of meds and then sends it off without double-checking. Patient has been taking propranolol by mouth for months and suddenly gets a prescription for the injectable? Yeah, that's gonna need a call to fix it. And then there are the errors that we couldn't possible know about, like when a patient shows up looking for a new inhaler they were supposed to start, and it turns out the prescriber has sent a different one from what they told the patient they were getting. Now we spent time filling it, the patient spent time coming here to pick it up, and we have to spend even *more* time now calling to get the right one, deleting the wrong one, and filling the right one.

steve496,49ers,1390348883.0,"Why would they?

They had a play they liked, and saving the timeouts means you can keep using the field on subsequent plays.  Obviously the play didn't work, but that's the only reason the decision seems at all questionable.

Basically: the goal of that drive is to use all remaining time on the clock and score a touchdown.  If we score with 2 minutes left, we give the Seahawks a huge opportunity to drive back down the field and kick a field goal.  Hence, the goal of that drive - as with any two minute drive - is to save your timeouts as long as possible, so you can run the clock down to 30 seconds and *then* start taking them.  That way, if you score right away you still don't leave the other team much time, yet you can still use the entire field on each play because you have time outs left.

Honestly, that drive was *perfect* right up until it all went wrong.  We were calling good plays, we were moving the ball, and 30 seconds with 2 time outs and a first down at the 30 yard line is *exactly* where you want to be in that situation.  You have time for 5 or 6 plays and can use the entire field.  Your entire offense is available to you.  And if you score at any point, you win.  The only thing that went wrong is the interception at the end - if not for that, we're probably talking about what a clutch drive with beautiful time management Kap put together."

However, advice is more meaningful when it takes into account what the OP wants get get out of it, and not what the responder wants the OP to do.

It seems to be less about helping the OP and his specific situation, and more a thought experiment on debating ""what is the ideal course of action."" It simply takes a lot more effort on both the OP and the responder to provide and look at enough detail to relativize the responses to each case.

Yes, there's class prejudice.

I wasn't the one assigning specific fault to any group to begin with. Completely the opposite: What I'm making perfectly clear is how crazy it is for some people to believe ""conservative men"" as a collective have that much control over relatively affluent women. This is something I hear too often (from both Asian women as well as both bluepillers and redpillers in the West), and it's so absurd that I wonder why it's not called out more often. If marriage/kids was a serious goal, then it's these conservative women and their families' own hangups about class that were crippling their options.

And to counter your point about tall receivers being overrated, I just fundamentally disagree on two levels. One, that they just statistically aren't, which you can look at any WR statistical measurement and find it loaded with guys 6'3"" and above. And two, that I think the argument of smaller WRs keeping drives alive and opponents off the field isn't true.

If we're talking about sustaining drives, let's take a measurement that is a good indicator of a team's success in that area. Say 3rd down conversion rate? http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/downs/sort/thirdDownConvPct/seasontype/2

I see teams like Chicago, Atlanta, New Orleans, Detroit, Cincinnati, teams that rely on big weapons, being more successful in third downs.

I think we associate smaller, quicker guys with being more effective at sustaining drives because that is their primary function (other than outliers like Desean Jackson and Antonio Brown, who are RZ weapons as well), while big dudes like Alshon and Brandon, A.J., and Calvin are actually very effective in sustaining drives as well as making the bigger, splash plays.

Moving the arena downtown will make it a lot more accessible and inviting for residents of the Sacramento community.

Your cheek color really isn't showing up in this picture at all. Maybe toss on a touch more?

Also, you have a wee bit of under eye shadow (but enviably little, from someone who has huge giant blue/purple bags under hers all the time), which doesn't change from your before to your after. I've found that regular concealer works fine for reddish blemishes and the like, but for my bluish shadowy under eye area, I really need a light-reflecting concealer. The trick is to not apply it to the whole area, but *only* to apply it to the underside of the bag/shadow.

So a series of Muscovite princes curried favor, married daughters of Khans, collecting taxes from other Rus principalities for the Mongols, etc.  This led to them gaining ascendency over other areas and gathering more land for what was now the Grand Duchy or Grand Principality of Moscow.

You will always respawn at the fast travel station in your zone or the nearest fast travel station (actually could a vet confirm exactly how this works?)

Killing enemies doesn't 'clear' the area. If you make progress halfway through a zone but have to stop playing and 'save and quit' all the enemies will return when you boot up next time. Any xp or gear you find you will save of course.

I'm not sure if just leaving it on pause will work, tbh I'm pretty new to the game myself (just about 100 casual hours).

2. It's hard work and can be unfriendly towards women generally and those who plan to work part time or want flexible hours. I work after hours and weekends quite often and if I had a family or wanted to have a family that's not conducive for a work/life balance. It's also difficult to get part time work within IT generally.
3. To me males seem to find technology ""gadgets"" more fascinating so it's probably not a strong pull for females.

It's a difficult question and I'm not sure what the answer is. I think more IT companies should encourage females to pursue a career in IT, I think schools should encourage females towards computer science classes (and more men to more female orientated class) but ultimately the female has to have the opportunity AND the drive.

It's hard sometimes. I'm the only female in my tech services team of about 10 and there are attitudes that would be off putting to me if I was younger or less ballsy. I've lost count of the times I've been asked to take minutes in meetings or do admin tasks when there are always men available to do this because ""I'm good at it"". You'd be good at it too if you did it a few times. I frequently get comments from staff that they'd like to speak to someone in IT, when I explain I am from IT there's an awkward silence. 

I frequently hear that voice and mobile technology (which is my specialty) isn't real IT or is soft IT. No idea why.

I pick my battles though on what I speak up about and personally mentor and encourage girls who work within IT. "

So it's not really in place in most countries - it seems to be an Old World/New World division.  In Europe and Asia, we're still all quite happily using a mixture of weight and tsp and tbsps; only the Americas, Canada and Australia are using cups. 

Also, no one really uses decilitres.  We use ml and L. 

Edited: Brazil and Mexico, Argentina still using weight/grams, tbs and tbsp like the UK. "

Dantilli,seduction,1390349488.0,"It obviously helps for logistics purposes but it isn't necessary to have a car OR your own place. For example in college I'd imagine most girls are in dorms (or whatever you call your student accomodation) so you could just go to her place instead (try and get invited to the parties in the dorms, they'll probably be your best bet). This is often pretty ideal as the nightlife will probably be pretty close to the student accomodation. A car is only used to go places, a taxi is a perfectly acceptable substitute.

In short, all it means is the logistics are a little more complicated. The actual picking up of the girls is no different so yeah, go for it.

PS: No offense but your question kinda sounds like you're just making excuses. Stop thinking about that shit, you don't know if you don't try right? If you want to hit on a girl just f-ing do it. If you really want it you'll find a way to make it work, just improvise."

It's also easier to get enough protein when you're eating a ton of food, obviously.

Anyway.

Meat, eggs, beans, peanut butter, dairy, tofu, nuts, etc. If you're vegetarian like me, some of the fake meat stuff has a ton of protein in it. I dice two of those tofurky italian sausages and add them to my pasta meals. They have 30g of protein each and I get two meals out of a box of pasta, a jar of sauce, 2 sausages and some sautéed veggies. That's like 50-60g of protein in each meal (pasta has a surprising amount of protein in it).

For breakfast, try like 3 eggs (7-10g protein each), a slice or two of peanut butter toast (another 10-20g), a tall glass of milk (~15g), and a piece of fruit. That's 50g+ of protein easy.

Protein powder really isn't necessary unless you have trouble downing enough food and need liquid calories."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390349697.0,"Of course it doesn't. I'm selfish. You're selfish. Everyone is selfish. Education is how you learn different ethical frameworks, how the world looks from both the bottom and the top, and ways to overcome natural inclination to go with ""it works for me, so it works for everyone."" Or worse, the ""it sounds good on paper, so I'm not going to think about it in context or outside an idealized model.""

That hostility is *not* universal in academia... if you're a student. You're supposed to recognize your own fallibility, the superior education of your professors, and *learn*. And ideally, it's not universal amongst graduates and PhDs and professional academics either, who are asked on a daily basis to collaborate. Some of the most brutal feedback I've ever had -- on my writing, my ideas, my entire ethical framework -- came from peers in college. I would have not made it very far if I was actively hostile. I wouldn't have earned any letters of recommendation, or had peers review my papers (and tell me to redo the entire thing because it's a shit, in one memorable occasion), and review theirs in return.

But that's academia. And, to a pretty large extent, business. You're required to collaborate and cede to the more knowledgable in business too.

Why is it so unfathomable to some people that they should collaborate and cede to the more informed in things like politics and the ""soft"" sciences? Yeah, everyone is entitled to an opinion. Problem is, there's a lot of people out there that have dedicated time and money to informing themselves of how their initial opinion was wrong, and they're not going to respect people that are actively hostile to doing the same."

I was at the game in Seattle on 12/23/12 when Mario snapped his knee, and I said before he hit the ground ""that's his career"" (shit you could hear the hit in a loud stadium, almost 100 yards away).

**However** those two knee injuries are different from one another in one very very important way. Mario's knee was forced *backwards* (pressure on ACL; rear ligament), whereas Bow's knee was forced sideways (pressure on outside ligaments). Talking with some family in the medical field, both agreed that sideways is much better than backwards, meaning the stress on the ACL and MCL should have not been as bad as Mario's."

citadel_lewis,DebateReligion,1390349912.0,"&gt;&gt; I don't dispute this. If you're going to be pragmatic about knowledge, fine. If you're going to be skeptical, fine. But don't vacillate between the two to suit your own purposes. Its my contention that is what Brian is doing.

&gt;I have been consistent in my posts. Certainty is unachievable, but knowledge does not require certainty. If you feel another user is being less consistent, fine, but that's not really relevant to me.

Seeing as I specifically referred to Brian, I have no idea why you thought I was referring to you.

&gt;&gt; I think you mean there are theories in development with no consensus. The notion of the mind being a private entity is absurd?! I think you need to define 'private'.

&gt;Private: ""a mind that is controlled and experienced exclusively by you"". I can cause massive shifts in your personality with targeted magnetic pulses. I can read your mind (albeit in extremely limited ways) with a good neuroimager. The mind is blatantly not private.

That's a really convenient definition for you. Self-determination and privacy are separate issues. Let's use the one that Wikipedia uses, instead: ""the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively."" After all, if I take drugs and cause massive shifts in my personality by external means, I have in no way had my privacy violated. Just the same, if you use magnetic pulses to cause a change in my personality, my privacy has not been violated either. To violate the privacy of my mind, you have to gain access to my subjective experiences. This is not possible, even with neuroimaging - unless you are going to tell me that a neuro-image correlated with a self-reported subjective experience is the same thing as reading someone's mind. It is not, and you will not find a single neuroscientist who says it is currently possible to read anyone's mind in a meaningful way. If that were so, we wouldn't be having trials to determine someone's guilt. If you can show me how to determine if someone is guilty from neuroimaging, fine. If you can show me a video of someone's dreams, fine. If you can transcribe for me a paragraph I compose in my head, fine. But you can't do any of these things. Therefore, the mind is blatantly private. It us up to you to provide evidence that it is not private in any meaninful way, and neuroimaging **is not** that evidence. 

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Meaning is entirely subjective. If you don't ascribe meaning to something, it is meaningless. If you do, it has meaning. A deity that is manifested as uniform natural processes will be ascribed meaning, without doubt, and this is confirmed by most pagan religions.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Explanatory power and predictive power are both concrete things that can be judged. A meaningless deity lacks either.

&gt;&gt; You're begging the question. A deity that is meaningless to you is not necessarily meaningless to someone else. You aren't the arbiter of meaning.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether or not it gives you warm fuzzies or makes you feel better about the world, it remains a vacuous concept.

&gt;&gt; Whether or not your ascribing meaninglessness to a deity gives you the warm fuzzies or makes you feel better about the world, it remains a subjective act, not an objective reality.

&gt;I am not begging the question, I am making a statement. 

One can't beg a question by making a statement? Untrue.

&gt;I am not presently interested in nor currently considering subjective experience coupled to a syntactically appropriate collection of squiggles. 

What does this mean? I'm sure you can phrase it a lot more clearly.

&gt;If a pantheist thinks the universe is worthy of reverence they can feel free to indulge 'till their heart's content, but without expectations beyond what would result from mundane forces any trappings of divinity are purely extraneous.

Yeah, pantheists can do what they want. They don't need your or my permission. I don't understand what you're saying, though - would it be possible to rephrase it using simpler language?"

To be honest, I don't think I ever fully overcame my insecurities. Sometimes, though much less frequently, I feel really foul about myself (especially when I'm PMSing, lol).

And with his help and patience, I've made really noticeable progress in self-esteem.

Hopefully, things will get better for your girlfriend, but I can't tell you that her doubts will definitely and completely vanish; this is something that is entirely dependent on the person and his/her own situation. If you are willing to stick with her through everything, then I commend you; you are a patient and loving person.

I think the best thing you can do is be blatantly obvious with her.  Tell her the things you said here and find ways to show her that you stand behind your word like you never have before.  If you can't quit smoking weed on your own, find professional help, take space from those around you that promote that behavior.  Spend some time with your family/close friends, you may need support in 2 weeks.

On the flip side of this, what's the big deal with smoking weed here and there?  You don't sound like you are abusing it and it's not like you are making huge mistakes (other than the lying).  If occasional smoking is part of your lifestyle, shouldn't your partner trust you to make your own choices?  Seems like unnecessary friction in your relationship.  

Perhaps it would mean more to see a therapist and focus on the honesty, not the weed.  If I were her, that would mean more.  That would address the root issue here and improved communication will benefit the relationship as a whole."

Honestly, I don't really care what the people in the video were protesting, it's irrelevant. And I don't care what the upset guy was upset about either. One of the things that makes this country great is that people *can* stand on a street corner and yell about their government. And that others can, in turn, yell back. When you get physical however, you cross the line.

Zoraptera,infertility,1390350235.0,"Mr. Z got tested for sperm count &amp; quality before we were even trying.  Why?  He had several conditions that frequently contribute to male infertility:

1. One very small testicle, noticeably MUCH smaller than the other.  (Turns out the first one is also smaller than average, but neither of us realized that until we read it on his urologist's notes.)
  
2. Inguinal hernia when he was a toddler.
  
3. Thyroid-like symptoms.  Always cold, low metabolism, dry skin, brittle nails, hair thinning (even though there's no history of baldness in his family), constipation.

4. Low testosterone.

5. Testicular cysts.

Any one of these might have been a problem.  The fact that he had five meant he didn't argue when I asked him to do an at-home sperm count test.

Over-the-counter sperm count tests exist now (we got ours at a local Walgreen's; they can also be ordered from Amazon), and the results can be seen at home (you don't have to mail them anywhere; it's a little more complicated than a pregnancy test, but not very much).

If you have reason to suspect that MFI could be an issue, DON'T WAIT.  Get answers right away.  A semenalysis is a LOT cheaper than an IUI cycle that might have zero chance of success."

Abracadanielle,PurplePillDebate,1390350461.0,"&gt; Free speech cause a problem with your logic. I don't think we're at the point we're willing to give up free speech for the comfort of women.

Free speech doesn't cover sexual harassment, in the same way it doesn't cover any other form of threat. And we are **absolutely** at the point where we're willing to ""give up free speech the comfort of women"", *that is why sexual harassment is illegal*. It's obvious that you, personally, don't think it should be, but it is.

&gt;Maybe you haven't witnessed cat calls.

I've done more than witness (which I also have), I have *experienced* catcalls, and I'm a little insulted at the notion that a woman should have to ""deal with"" the consequences of being attractive. Bullshit. No one should have to ""deal with"" harassment. 

Also, Chris Rock is not a sociologist, and while I enjoy his comedy, I don't think his ""dick is given in a variety of ways"" schtick has any place in a serious debate about sexual harassment.

&gt;If a girl is attractive that's what she has to deal with. Because of free speech, she doesn't really have a choice. 

That makes zero sense. Why do you think there are campaigns to stop street harassment? Why do you think I'm here in this thread trying to explain to you what sexual harassment is, even after you keep rejecting the definition, both in my own comments and others that I've seen you respond to? Women *absolutely* have a choice to speak up against it. I am, in fact, doing it right now."

ANewMachine615,FanTheories,1390350579.0,"Issues:

&gt;Eventually Illuvatar called the Ainur back to his realm

We know from the Ainulindale that the Valar cannot leave the World until Time ends. They are bound to it, permanently.

&gt;the Elves went into hiding due to dwindling numbers caused by interbreeding with men

Why would their numbers dwindle? They're immortal, and after death, they return to life after a time with Mandos. Again, they're bound to the world until it ends.

&gt;This would explain events such as the construction of archaeological sites far too advanced for the time when they were made; it wasn't that men weren't advanced enough, they just lost that knowledge after the Ainur and the elves left. It would explain sites like the many Mayan ruins, Macchu Picchu, the Moai statues on Eastern Island, Tiahuanaco, etc. All these monumental achievements were made with the help and guidance of the Ainur and possibly the elves. Also the Ancient Astronauts depicted in some pre-columbian art could be attributed to the Ainur, a race so far beyond human understanding that it would be considered extraterrestrial (which it kinda is I suppose). 

Of course, none of that is necessary, since those were built by humans.

Also, riddle me this: so Valinor is returned to the World. Where are the Walls of Night? The Pelori, the great mountains on the eastern shore of Valinor -- so high they cast shadows all the way to Middle-earth. Can't realistically be the Appalachians given their size in the old stories."

All it takes is some critical thinking. Patriarchy doesn't mean ""all men oppressing all women."" No dictionary or encyclopedia says that. And I certainly didn't learn that in actual gender studies, sociology, and feminist philosophy courses.

Five minutes of critical thought. That's all it takes. Just stop with the accusations of being a tumbrina, a red pill shill, and all that internet nonsense. Think about it holistically, academically, rationally. What does ""patriarchy"" mean, to normal people? What has it *always* meant?

It's a social system. It's just a word for a particular kind of social system. Like ""capitalism"" is a word for a particular kind of economic system. And in this social system, men are the primary authority figures -- they occupy, beyond the demographic equilibrium, positions of political leadership and religious, familial, and moral authority. They also control the most property. It also entails some sort of patrilineal heritage is the norm, even if it is benign as naming conventions (e.g. taking the husband's name in marriage).

shytemptation,AskMen,1390350785.0,"I think most women aren't going to judge a guy as creepy purely for being shy and a little awkward if he has otherwise been a fairly nice, polite kind of person. Creepy is more a matter of not respecting or being aware of normal boundaries. Creepy is about having no empathy and no recognition of body and verbal signals indicating disinterest such as very curt answers with as few words as possible and looking away frequently, especially towards an exit. Interrupting a girl in the middle of her sobbing about her beloved pet dying to ask her on a date might come across as cold and creepy. Professing love to a girl without ever actually having a one on one conversation with her first will come across as creepy because how can a guy love her without even taking the time to get to know who she really is? Cornering a girl in an area where she can't get away and asking her out is kinda creepy. 

A guy acquaintance that a girl had a few pleasant conversations with before/after class who nervously asks a her out on a date isn't generally going to be seen as creepy just for asking, even if he is completely unattractive and uninteresting.

Usually the hardest thing for women to quantify about what makes a guy creepy are the subtle ways some guys will cross boundaries, which is why a supposedly 'nice' guy will come across as creepy to women even if he seems okay to guys. To get the creep label the guy has generally crossed a boundary such as not backing off and leaving the woman alone when the woman is trying to act as disinterested as she can while still keeping up an aura of politeness."

It was an awful experience, and just another reason why I used to think sex was such an awful thing."

the average polish person earned about 600000 zl per month. More than a half of the average income would be in question.

namer98,Judaism,1390351063.0,"&gt; as a Reform who believes it is not necessary to keep kosher nor that the Torah is the complete word God, my answer would be very different than an Orthodox member (or even a Conservative one). So would it be okay for me to post ""No the Torah is not completely the word of God and was not handed down from God at Mount Sinai"" or ""No a Jew is not required to keep kosher"" without prefacing my post that I am reform? 

Yes, that is ok. I prefer all people to preface ""as X Jew, I believe Y"", but it isn't a rule.

&gt;If I posted either of those, I guarantee there would be more religious members instantly quoting passages from the Torah and saying that I am wrong

Are you claiming ""as X Jew, I believe Y"" will solve that? Because I doubt it will.

As frustrating as it can be, you don't have to respond. You can do the same thing to people you disagree with.

&gt;A strong reason we see less posts of the less religious or Reform truly is because it is not fun feeling we have to defend our beliefs.

You are not required to defend your beliefs. But I will not make a rule ""do not question others"", which is what it appears to me you are asking for. That is a circlejerk.

Considering that from flair and the survey, orthodoxy is not a majority, there is no good reason that there cannot be a good voice for any other denomination. Non-Orthodox is a majority, and by a large number. If they decided to participate, they would easily dominate the conversation. "

neekz0r,webdev,1390351285.0,"A database is basically a way of storing data, as you probably know. There are many types of databases and many classifications of them. Some are simply flat files, such as sqlite. Others are more robust such as Oracle. 

Now, what they tend have in common is they tend to use SQL. However, while they use SQL, just like any human language, they each of their dialects. That is to say, while most understand the most basic  statement 'select * from database.tablename', others may have interesting things like 'select count(*) from database.tablename' which not all databases understand. Essentially, SQL is a common(ish) way to tell the database what you want to do with data. 

Add to this the newish invention of NoSQL style databases, such as Mongo, which fall in the database world but don't use SQL and have a completely different way of storing data.

So, here is an intro to what most databases do:

**A**tomicity makes sure everything happens at once or doesn't happen at all. 

**C**onsistency makes sure the data is within required parameters. 

**I**solation makes sure there are no race conditions. 

**D**urability makes sure data doesn't get lost. 

So a brief intro into why the above concepts are important to you as a web developer. You have two users using a properly designed website. One places an order, the other checks the status of orders. Due to **Atomicity**, the person checking the order doesn't see a partial order. He won't see just a first and last name with no other information. Due to **Consistency**, he won't see letters in the credit card field. Due to **Isolation**, he can update the order status without fear that he'll corrupt the persons order -- even though the person is viewing it or changing it. Finally, due to **Durability**, the server can be shutdown without losing the order data.

A word on security for databases: please look into data sanitization or data scrubbing to avoid what is known as SQL injections. "

balathustrius,mead,1390351305.0,"With fruit, I wash the outside very well under cold water. Some fruit benefit from being frozen, to break their cell walls, then thawed and added to the mead.

You have a few other options. Some people make a fruit purée and add that to primary. 

You can also hold off on pitching after you add fruit, then use campden tablets to level the field of any nasties before introducing your yeast 24 hours later.

Lots of folks add fruit to secondary, after fermentation has slowed down, to avoid the escaping CO2 carrying aromatics away with them. The high alcohol content also helps to keep baddies out.

With oranges you generally want to avoid the pith, the white stuff under the zest. So yeah, zest it, remove and discard as much pith as you can, then add the rest if you like.

**Edit**: After the gentlemen /u/Meteorsw4rm and /u/Meadery chimed in, I had a couple more thoughts.

In terms of sanitation, I personally don't give fruit more than a rinse unless their origins are suspect. Were I commercial or making a particularly *large* batch, I would probably take stricter steps. But even Ken Schramm doesn't seem too paranoid about contamination from fruit ([via this interview](http://traffic.libsyn.com/basicbrewing/bbr01-09-14schramm.mp3)). He states that he generally washes them and then over-pitches his yeast to strangle out any microbial competition.

Freezing is most effective for non-pulpy fruit like cherries and blackberries. Oranges sections, split open to expose the pulp, probably don't need freezing. Neither do peaches. (But you can do it anyway, if you want. It doesn't hurt.) When I freeze fruit, I gently squish them *before* they are frozen, because it's a lot easier to break their skins then than later, especially if you forget to take them out in time to thaw. . .

Remember that if you purée your fruit, you may lose a large amount of mead during racking. Fruit puree just doesn't compact very well."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390351479.0,"I have mixed feelings about this.  I do 3D graphics and compositing in post production..and what inspired me and the few other women in my field to join, primarily, was our love of video games.  So I'm inclined to say that when we get more girls in to gaming (and I believe it's already happening...more girls need to graduate from casual gaming to the more challenging ones though), it would start happening. I haven't really given this much thought, actually.  3D is a mesh of not just design and artistic capabilities...which many women already have and are interested in...but of technical skill as well.  I've heard that women more commonly use both hemispheres of their brain, compared to guys, so you'd think women would be a good candidate for this.  Once again, this is kind of the first time I've thought about enticing women in to the work force...and I'm not really sure what to say.  Just that what brought me and my female friends in to it is video games, and the desire to make video games.  So that's a good avenue to lead in to it.  At the same time, the industry is in such a flux right now...with big name, award-winning VFX companies collapsing...that I dunno if I would really recommend people to get in to it.

EDIT: While it is definitely male dominated, and I have been amidst sexist conversations at times....I don't think anyone in our industry gets held down by their gender.  Even concerning a college degree or lack of one, our industry pretty much  just cares about one thing - can you get the job done?  Doesn't matter who or what you are, if you can get the job done, you will rise up.  Oh, and you also have to be personable...but that, I think, is a skill that benefits anyone in any industry."

Those ports are faster than normal USB 2.0 ports when used with USB 3.0 devices. The cable and connectors are different from USB 2.0, but the USB ports are the same. You'll still be able to hook up the USB 2.0 ports on the front panel, though, because there are USB 2.0 connectors on the motherboard as well.

VoxMeretricis,AskWomen,1390351489.0,"I wouldn't say traditional gender *roles*, since, as other posters have noted, many of the lower income families that I know of tend to be headed by single mothers.

However, I think that does tie into a slightly stronger belief in traditional gender *values*. So, many of the men from these families believe strongly in being a provider for their own family, and ""taking care"" of their wife and the mother of their children because they saw the negative effect that not having a providing partner had on their own mothers. To them, having the woman stay home and take care of their children rather than working to pay the bills as a privilege. In the same sense, the women tend to value men who are capable of providing for them, for fear of ending up in the same difficult position their mothers were in. 

Of course, any generalizations are problematic. In this day and age, having one parent stay home is more often reserved for the middle to upper classes, not the working to lower, so you could just as easily argue the opposite about traditional gender values."

All they really cared about was (1) are you good in your subject and (2) can you handle the work. 

I don't consider myself to be an especially interesting person, so I found it WAY easier to apply to Oxford. I can speak to my interest in the subject and answer questions about it on interview, but if you ask me what my greatest accomplishment was I'm just not gonna be able to answer that.

Thursday, I bench 3x3 for intensity. After that, I've been trying different things, but I think I've decided to do heavy push press, 4x2. Then I'll do close grip BP and curls, keeping it light and in good form.

Dantilli,socialskills,1390352193.0,"Hey, I remember your other post, good job. 

I have a question:

What is the best way to find out whether he is interested?

You have to ask him. I know it's fucking terrifying, it's STILL fucking terrifying and I've asked many people on dates. But if you really want this relationship it's what you're gonna have to do. It's obvious he's to cowardly to ask you so go do it. What is the worst that can happen? he'll say no and you can finally stop obsessing over him. A rejection is no-where near as bad as the fear of asking the question, trust me on that one, just push through it and ask. I can guarantee you'll feel really proud of yourself no matter what the answer is.

Remember that asking him out is not a big thing, the whole purpose of the first few dates IS to work out if you like each other. You don't have to know whether he lies you to ask him out because **the whole point of going on a date is to find out if you like each other**. So instead of only asking him out IF he likes you. Ask him out because you WANT TO KNOW whether you like each other.

Before you start, this should be done in person. A phonecall/text is NOT acceptable and I'm sure you'd agree you're just running away if you try either of those.

**Just do it**

When you think your about to scrape the tail get into the habit of shifting your weight to put all 4 wheels back on the ground, rather than scraping.  

That's what I did, and it made my tail last a hell of a lot longer, had the same board for 2 months and it still has a lot of pop.  

As far as ollies, you can't really change the fact that your tail gets worn down when you snap it up.  However it might help a bit if you do a quicker snap so it drags less on the ground, you can pop quicker if you put your toe more in the middle of the tail pocket, with the ball of your foot hanging off a little bit.  

This makes you pop it quicker, might help with razortail, a slower pop means more time to drag on the ground (all those little .5 second scrapes add up quicker than .2 second scrapes, etc.)"

AtlasRaps,JapanTravel,1390352518.0,"It's gonna be hard. I lived there for 4 months, and was placed in a homestay, and that was about the only way to really become intimate with the culture. Knowing enough Japanese to get by is a NECESSITY if you want to become immersed; many will understand your English, but you will immediately be dismissed as a tourist. Japanese is remarkably hard for most westerners, so I would get started ASAP.

The biggest thing you can to to get a non-touristy experience is to visit smaller countryside towns that don't have many international tourists. I recommend places like Toba (Ise Jingu), Takayama, and even Nara. But Tokyo and Kyoto are pretty impossible not to be dismissed as a tourist in, because there are so many international tourists. Also, when you have a choice, go to restaurants with no English signage, you will get more a more culturally authentic experience. 

Festivals in general you will have no problem attending, just make sure you do your reading beforehand so that you don't commit any grievous cultural faux-pas.

Japanese people in general have a hard time believing that foreigners can speak Japanese and understand Japanese culture well, so trying to actually understand and participate in the culture is an uphill battle. The culture also often discourages meeting random strangers, so you've got an uphill battle in terms of meeting Japanese people as well. (Although guest houses and foreigner bars are usually good exceptions to the rule)

All in all, your goal is laudable, but it's gonna be really hard to achieve. If you're serious about it I recommend you get started with the language and cultural education ASAP. 

Let me know if you have any other questions!

Edit: Even after living in Japan for 4 months and being conversational in the language, I was always treated as a foreigner; that's just part of the culture. And I was never an insider, Japanese and American culture are too different for that. But after a month or so, I didn't FEEL like an outsider any more, I felt like I understood and survived within Japanese cultural paradigms. That level of immersion is possible. Perfect immersion is probably not."

Oh awesome, postmodernist bullshit right on schedule. Practicality is superior because I can't feed my fucking kid with ""life experiences"". 

&gt;I think that would be more indicative of Women's Studies teaching more how to argue and win the people over rather than classical debate and study. I would prefer if they would at least learn how to fudge the numbers and statistics (Yes, statistics can lie if they're presented the right way), but that's more at me being an arguing enthusiast than anything else.

I'm using Women's Studies as indicative of a trend. You could replace that with any other liberal arts field and find the same ridiculous abstract logic. When nothing is based in any concrete standard, any argument can easily be dismissed. 

&gt;Yeah, it is entirely unearned. It's not the Eng Lit's fault they picked a course they're good at, and it's not Eng Lit's fault the CS has to work his ass off. There's different circumstances, and STEMs should know firsthand that jealousy skews perceptions of results, so should be avoided.

You misunderstand the point. Liberal arts classes are objectively easier than math and hard sciences, because you don't need to worry about being 100% correct. You can be in the right ballpark, and as long as you articulate it and follow arbitrary citation guidelines that nobody actually checks, you can ace a class, whereas acing a class in a hard science requires total mastery of the material. You're using a putative Lit major's good grades as an indication that ""hey, maybe he's just smart"" when liberal arts classes are known to simply give out higher grades. The exacting criteria by which STEM work is judged is objectively harder to fulfill than the nebulous standards by which essays and creative writing are graded.

&gt;People can be good at different subjects, plus I REALLY think your cherry picking the bad Liberal Arts students against the best and brightest STEMs in your estimation.

Do you really not grasp that I'm talking about general trends here? I TA'd for several intro-level CS courses and it was always the liberal arts guys trying to fulfill a math requirement who were utterly lost. Meanwhile, none of my peers had any trouble navigating the vapid discourse that dominated intro Philosophy classes.

&gt;Because it's very easy to become disheartened with a field that requires 100% attention to detail at all times, along with having absolutely nothing be sacred or invariably true. That's part of why religion gives a lot of people comfort, it says it can't ever be wrong. Having very young kids grapple with the fact that there's no rock, no anchor that can't be swept away would probably lead to a high attrition rate.

And here's the crux of why I can't take your opinion seriously. You've outright admitted that STEM fields are objectively more difficult than liberal arts - why shouldn't I feel superior to people who cling to the crutch of subjectivity, to answers that can't be dismissed? Liberal arts is the easy way ""out"" of college while still giving you the illusion that you've accomplished something. I can forgive people who were goaded into going to college without any kind of clarification that there's no job market for English majors but willfully choosing it because ""STEM is too hard"" is just fucking despicable. 

&gt;That falls back into my earlier statements that degrees are more than magical get-good-job tickets.

This is a meaningless platitude only uttered by people with useless degrees. A STEM degree, provided you actually applied yourself in school, is pretty much a guaranteed job. 

&gt;Basically, those different endings actually illustrate that we're all just trying to make it along, that we can all be victims to the world around us, and have different things we can bring to each other's lives.

No, the point is that some of us are trying to make it along, and those who don't often look at the success of others and wonder why, despite not working as hard, they're not also successful. I can't take liberal arts majors seriously, who complain about a lack of female CEOs but didn't study business, who complain about lack of transgender representation in video games but fucked off studying Norwegian History instead of making their own games.

Probably the most ""unrealistic"" part was that the camera does things to people- Classmates who'd always been nice to me (and obviously those that hadn't been so nice) were saying the nastiest things about me in front of the camera because the nastier the comment, the more likely to be on TV, I guess.

We all spend a lot to contribute, so you need to either pitch in with stuff or toward costs."" Why on earth did you let him dominate game night time and time again without ever saying something? ""Hey, AnnoyingGuy, we're playing Catan tonight. It doesn't seem like your thing, so we're going to do this game ourselves and then you want to jump in for the next one?"" Finally, after things got to the breaking point and he was told he wasn't welcome at the game (which, why on earth are you still holding it at that apartment? *he lives there*. is there not a single one of you else who could host it) why on earth did you (again, you all) choose to openly mock and insult him instead of saying something at the beginning of the game? I'm not saying he would have taken any of those statements well, but his bad behavior is on him, but that doesn't change the fact that speaking up was the right thing to do, and instead you chose not to do it. Your bad behavior is on you. 

Look, I get that it's hard to be assertive. But frankly, you guys kind of deserve this drama. I'm not saying you owe this guy friendship - he sounds like a nightmare to hang out with.

I just keep hearing story after story and it's always the same thing: people with no idea about the project they are working on confusing ""managing"" for being an alpha male or female. 

Usually a combination of these things:

*Meetings which waste everyone's time  and achieve nothing except for showing that the manger has the power to call meetings. No one else needs meetings. 

*Obstructing ground level innovation. Because it looks like rebellion, or because they haven't got the power to say yes to anything. 

*Making unchallenged decisions they are unqualified to make. 

*Getting to frame the experience to other managers, placing them in positions which expose them to more power. 

*Constantly demanding updates and reports which end up adding huge time to projects whilst breaking employee rhythm. 

*Trying to find ways to make looking at Microsoft project whilst being completely helpless seem empowering. 

*Not lowering themselves to actually facilitating work. 

*Having the power to push down, but not up. Making them useless. 

*Confusing superior ""people skills"" with agreeing with absolutely everything a client says no matter how ridiculous or costly, and without the appropriate skills to suggest alternatives.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390352913.0,"I think this may more be of an ethnic/cultural thing, in regards to holding to traditional gender roles.  Everyone I know who grew up poor, including myself, grew up being afraid of becoming poor again.  We all ""grew up fast"", taking on household responsibilities earlier than our upper-middle class counterparts (such as cooking, regardless of our gender), getting jobs as soon as possible when we were teenagers.  Some worked under the table since they were 12.  I should also note that a lot of my friends are children of immigrants, and I think what our parents taught us about traditional customs relates more to what you're talking about.  And that being said, while I do think my mom is very traditional (believing one must marry before moving in with a guy, for instance, and waiting for marriage before sex)....she did tell me and my sister to be strong, assertive women who stand up for what we want and need.  But I know in some other immigrant families, they really impress certain gender roles and cultural expectations on things.  I think a lot of lower income recent immigrants would encourage their kids to go out and work, and a lot of us want to inherently, because we see our parents working so hard. We don't resent them for it, we want to help them...

The low income stuff by itself, from what I have seen anecdotally, influences more of how driven and frugal a person is.

Again, all I'm reporting is my personal experience and that of those around me.  There could definitely be some self-selection that I am not conscious of going on.  Especially since I do not like hanging around people who do not share the same 'driven' attitude as myself.  I'm fine with differing politics, but I get aggravated at displays of laziness.  I feel like...if I hit submit on my comment, people are going to get at me for generalizing about poor and immigrant families.  This is my experience though, so I think there is validity in them in a speculation thread...

I'm not too familiar with Americans who have had low income for generations and how it influences their perception of traditional gender roles.  Honestly speaking, I feel like a lot of the poor-through-the-generations families I meet are poor for a reason; I see them squander what money they do get on brand name things.  Like I'll see on Facebook, a certain person giving out genuine Burberry everything to her friends...bags and bags of them.  Or another guy who has close to $10k of photography equipment for a hobby that he hasn't tried to monetize.  Another common thing is I keep seeing these acquaintances posting new $500 brightly colored Nikes every few weeks.  I'm not very close to them, because I disagree with a lot of their choices outside of this. But these that I know are also on some kind of government assistance, and a part time job, like baggage guy at the airport or cashier at a burger place.

One unfortunate thing about growing up poor that I have noticed....we exhibit hoarder mentality more often than those who grew up well off.  I have to consciously tell myself it's okay to let things go.  I have to block that fear of, ""If I get rid of it now, what if I need it later and I can't afford it later?""  My mom is financially okay now, especially since I grew up and am no longer dependent, and she was smart with investments.  She can't buy herself a condo but she's not hurting for money.  Yet still I see her literally in rags with holes and stains in them.  She has some beautiful clothes in the closet, still with the tags on, but she doesn't wear it.  A lot of them are gifts from well-off friends.  She says her old clothes are still good.  I think more middle income people have more of the mentality that they can get rid of their clothes like every year and just buy more.  We repair our shoes at a cobbler's and try to stretch things as far as possible.  You could walk down the street and see so many good, functional things that people have discarded.  I go to other people's homes who grew up well off (but now that they're on their own they live paycheck to paycheck) and I'll see them toss things that are still good, for petty reasons like...""I don't want to bother cleaning it""."

Disregard the incompatibility, I've used the same mobo with the 6300 and 8320/50 and it's fine without a Bios update.

CPU already has CPU Cooler, in your budget unless you're OCing you really don't need it. Better Mobo. I love this mobo, although you could get a cheaper one like the MSI G43 or G46. Cheaper RAM, generally go for cheaper RAM they all do the same thing. Smaller HDD (2TB, why do you need 3) A LOT BETTER GPU, this will play just about everything from ultra to high with very good FPS. Better Case in my opinion, less pricy, very well and generally praised in this Sub. Better PSU (I never go 650W since it's not enough for SLI or Crossfire, perfect for 1 GPU) it's cheaper too. Antec is good, I just like Corsairs CX line. 

A lot better CPU, new architecture. Slighly pricier build. Better CPU and GPU - by a landslide"

I think *Doom* still suffers from having the plans rely on the JL's heroic natures, which wouldn't be the case if they went evil. But I can see how they could be modified to affect rogue Leaguers. They'd be less likely to work, I think, but they could still work.

Here are some common mistakes from my coach: http://www.swimmingworldmagazine.com/lane9/news/World/30766.asp

Some things you can do to work on pullouts:

* If you have a short pool (12.5 yards or so), or a turn wall, do repetitions of push-pullout-turn (x10 or so at a time) back and forth until you can barely make it without coming up for air.  You'll quickly see where you're failing when you get tired

* Do a push-pullout as far as you can go.  Try to make a full 25 yards doing a legal pullout.

* Film your pullout from the side and ensure you are doing the push and pullout parts entirely parallel with the surface of the water.  You should not angle up or down until the recovery-kick phase.

* Ensure you are pushing off at the right depth (1.5x the width of your body)

Biggest mistakes I see:

* **Timing**: swimmers have a tendency to rush certain parts of the pullout, especially in races.  Relax.  Timing should be approximately a ratio of 3-2-1, but this really depends on feel.  Push...1...2...3...Pull down...1...2...Recover, kick...1...Breakout

* **Head Position**: people tend to follow their hands with their head.  They [pull down and their head goes down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL5SGgqDtEY) (they tuck their chin), angling them toward the bottom of the pool.  They recover their hands and their head comes up, angling them back up.  I think about the opposite.  When your hands break from streamline to pull, lift your head to a neutral position, when they come back up, tuck it back in: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ofDYZ8SICU (White cap demonstrates what I'm talking about re: head position, green cap has best overall pullout)"
TheDrunkenChud,guns,1390353085.0,"some people just love the lie. i was reading a story on here a week or two back about a guy who was working in a call center or something and claimed to moonlight as a ""tactical emt"". lived the lie. always claiming this and that and then got arrested for impersonating a law officer or something. even after the arrest and the house of cards collapsed he tried to salvage the lie. almost compulsively. i had a friend like that once. just always one lie after another to make himself look better to people. eventually he created around 20 different internet personas and a website in which he was the only contributor with all his ""contributors"" being his multiple aliases. 

when i read shit like what was posted, there are certain... themes? i guess? that come across that remind me of him and his web of lies that he actually believed. that's why i feel this guy may be a troll, but he may just be a liar that believes his own bullshit. his only knowledge of guns comes from ncis and call of duty. maybe paul blart mall cop. but, again, could be a bored ass troll. who knows. either way, it's funny in a sad way."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390353091.0,"I am explaining it poorly, I think.

I didn't learn how to appreciate going to a movie. It is not as if I had never been to the movies, I had, and quite enjoyed each one.

I learned that anything beyond meeting human needs (food, shelter, health, companionships, intellectual developments, not being unhappy/miserable) is actually important to life. That happiness itself is worthwhile as a pursuit. 

I learned that it is okay, and even important, to simply find pleasure in something. To either (1) adapt or modify a something that has to get done so that the doing is fun/pleasurable or (2) do something that has no other purpose but to be fun and make you feel happy, even after the basic need of not feeling miserable is met.

My point is that, in order to be happy, in order to have the environmental inputs that have the potential to cause happiness, happiness needs to be the goal. Or at least *a* goal. It needs to actually *be sought after*, desired.

*Then* the environmental inputs that have the potential to instill happiness, and the correct mindset and expectations can breed happiness.

Without the *intention* of happiness, someone could, as I did, follow your equation, but not pursue/engage in activities/lifestyle to the extent that happiness is achieved, stopping instead at contentment.

circledot,indianapolis,1390353109.0,"I'm sort of wondering where on the NW side you live. I am a lifetime Indy resident and there are very few places in the city I would truly consider unsafe. I would really only stay away from many parts of the east side of town and the near northside south of 38th street inside 465. Even so, I've been in both areas and never had a problem. It's all up to your personal level of safety though.

If you are looking for VERY low crime you might want to head to Carmel/Fishers/Zionsville, but I think if you want to live in the city you have to be OK with the possibility of crime. For me the benefits of city living outweigh the risks.

I grew up in Broad Ripple and love the area. There's shopping, restaurants, and events going on all the time, and the residents are friendly and treat the area as a community. I moved to the Eagle Creek area last year to be closer to work, and I just haven't felt the same sense of community, so I am looking forward to going back when my lease is up. However, I did have my car and house broken into while living in the Broad Ripple area. The people doing these things aren't from the neighborhood, though. Like I said, the residents are super friendly and take care of the neighborhood. The north side is considered more affluent so I think it can attract some shady people. I would say just to keep your car/house/garage locked and your chances of becoming a victim are pretty small.

I would stay within some boundaries, though. Anywhere east of College Ave. from about 46th St. to 96th St. is very nice. West of College from 52nd St. to 96th St. is also nice. I wouldn't go much south of 52nd since the neighborhood gets kinda sketchy around the Kingsley/Evanston/Crittenden area. If I could choose anywhere in the Broad Ripple area, though, I would choose to live near 57th-60th and Broadway St.

I have friends who live in the 86th and Ditch area, and they like it a lot. There's a number of nice looking apartment complexes from there to the Castleton area. My sister lived at 96th and Allisonville and enjoyed it, but the traffic gets really bad around rush hours."

I meant more uneducated than anything else. I'm sure you've picked up that I'm an elitist asshole about my own education. I'm far to cynical to belief that selfishness is anything other than most people's natural state. Even the most well-intentioned are selfish. A lack of perspective is the disease. Education is the cure.

Of course, I know plenty of educated people who are assholes. So it's not a surefire coorelation. But if you're educated and wrong, at least you can be wrong with class. Of course, that means that your own blindspots are all the more glaring for how you neglect them.

&gt;Maybe your efforts would be better spent where your credentials can speak for themselves?

In a turn of events I'm sure surprises nobody, a degree in Philosophy is very useless outside of getting more degrees in philosophy. But I am in law school, and it suits me just fine. I've been told I write very nice papers, better than students that didn't opt for rigorous course work in the liberal arts. Since law school is 90% reading and writing (the other 10% is hellish revision for finals), being accustomed to being told I'm full of shit and then constructing a better argument is old hat.

I also write ad copy for my work. Law and philosophy and that dry extremely precise writing style lend themselves well to advertising and marketing.

&gt;My opinions are a bit skewed because I've seen some people, like spermjackalop, and sretiderytsan make asses of themselves while saying that they have a gender studies degree.

Not only is it the fact that people can now communicate with anybody regardless of location and language barriers, but I worked in high schools and it's no longer cool to bully. The coolest kids looked out for the less-cool kids. Humanity is looking pretty good IMO."

FatHitman,videos,1390353719.0,"As someone who has recently started to work at a prison with about 80% of the inmate being pedo's (sex offenders), I find them to be very strange. Most of them are always anti-social and really never can look an adult in the eye when they are talking to you. 

It was a really strange when I started at this prison since its known to be the sex offender prison. All of our inmates are protective custody or high profile inmates. So for the most part they act good since they know if they get sent to any other prison they will be beaten badly by the population of the new prison. But if they do act up we just send them to another FCI and then they have to deal with the repercussions. 

But from what I have seen these guys can't be fixed. Our docs try their best to drug them up which works but once they get out of prison and don't have access to the drugs.... well they go back to their old ways. Also most of them are smarter than the average inmate so I really don't think they have that much of a lower IQ. Hell most of them are super smart and had their own businesses before they got arrested.

We find a lot of the sex offenders seem to not differentiate between being gay or straight. Most of them start having sex with other men just because that is the only thing available while in prison. "

squeadunk,BabyBumps,1390353801.0,"We have two dogs and 3 cats.  For the most part I'm not worried.  The cats will leave if they feel annoyed, with maybe a hiss before they run off.  

One of my dogs (a mutt, probably a pitt mix) is incredibly loving and really non-aggressive.  We take her to the dog park every week or two and she generally does very well.  We put her in time out if she's too rambunctious (she has to come sit with me until I tell her she can go play).  If something I do hurts her (accidentally such as when she has a wound) she does a soft cry and that's it.  

Our other dog also does fairly well at the dog park.  He adores kids because he thinks their sole purpose in life is to throw balls for him, especially little boys.  However, this is my nervous dog.  He has snapped at people twice in 5 years, both in the last year.  I think in both situations he felt threatened, even though he had initiated the interaction.  He doesn't like to be restrained, and I think he felt like he couldn't leave (even though in at least one of those situations he could have just jumped off the chair he'd put himself on).  

My husband is worried about him with the baby.  He sleeps with us and we're planning on having the baby in our room.  He's EXTREMELY attached to me and is a ""mama's boy"".  When I bathe him/trim his nails, I always give him freedom of movement so he can leave when he's uncomfortable.  Then I coax him back.  For example, this week I trimmed his nails.  When I was almost done he suddenly yelped, growled, threw himself off the couch, and frantically shoved his toy that was on the floor in my hand-all within 1 second.  

Our vet and passersby always comment what great dogs we have, how friendly and well behaved they are, and how well trained they are.  Which they are.  

I just don't want my nervous dog's idiosyncrasies to hurt him, someone else, or my baby.  But I'm kind of at a loss of how to address it.  I'm a special ed teacher who predominantly works with students with significant behavior, so my husband generally follows my lead.  

I'm just not sure how else to address my dog's fears other than structuring his environment and telling people in it (baby included) to be gentle and not hold him or put their arms around him because he could get scared."

&gt;I often got attacked by exes for dating someone after the previous relationship ended, but somehow not being ""sensitive"" to the old relationship.

For someone with a self-proclaimed high EQ, this and a few other statements of exaggerated surprise at relatively normal reactions kind of rubbed me the wrong way. A high EQ/EI isn't all about *you*, and your ability to articulate your own emotions, but also your ability to empathize with what other people feel. People often want to grieve and mourn for relationships that are over. I'm not saying you have to oblige them, but to feign a complete lack of understanding of that concept quirks my eyebrow up something fierce. Same goes for potential partners that were shocked you did not want to participate in monogamy; okay, be surprised a handful of times. After that, you have to wonder what you, as the common denominator, are not being direct enough about.

I'm sex-positive as fuck, and I've gotten jealous. Correction, GET jealous. I've operated under ""if you find someone that does this [whatever this is] better than me and you no longer want to do it with me, then by all means"" kind of standard through every one of my relationships. I respect privacy and I don't distrust, and I've had a fair share of ""reasons"" to do the opposite. I never have, but if I felt those ominous feelings, there are only a few options that my mind can rationally pursue: I'm right, time to go. I'm wrong, time to figure out what's going on in my head. or I'm wrong, can't figure out what's going on in my head, still time to go.

But I digress! It doesn't change the fact that for all my well-adjusted EQ/EI, sometimes I've just had a knee-jerk reaction to something and felt ""wait no, MINE MINE MINE!"" It doesn't make it right or wrong, but pretending it isn't there just means I don't deal with it, and that's when my wires get super crossed and I'm bawling in a Starbucks restroom. Don't you judge me. It wasn't a social construct that got me there, it was just some insane narrative I spun in my head and bought into, even if momentarily, for one or many of a plethora of reasons.  Them's just the breaks, sometimes.

Kids don't NEED to go to the zoo, but the one near me is free so we'd only be paying for gas to get there. Buy groceries and pack their lunch,you don't need lunch money. Most after school clubs are free or offer scholarships if they aren't. Field trips are what, $5-20 a piece, maybe two a year? Ifmy kid breaks their toys that's just too bad for them, I am not replacing it. Toys for Christmas and birthdays you can get really cheap second hand and are just as good as new if you know where to look. And kids don't need sweets and electronics. I will agree school supplies can be a little pricey. So, ok, groceries, toiletries, school supplies, field trips, and gas. Still not that much. You just gotta know how to budget and be thrifty.

arcsecond,animation,1390353881.0,"A lot depends on the studio but things usually go through stages that advance sort of in parallel. As soon as there's even a rough model someone starts rigging. As soon as there's a first rig someone starts animating. (though often the first stuff is just motion tests to get the look right) Then as changes are made they propagate down the pipeline.

Animators are usually assigned shots (one camera cut) and animate everything in that shot. Often they're given shots that are close to each other in sequence for consistency sake. They'll also follow a specific shot until it's approved (unless something happens, no one wants to have their shots taken away) Teams of animators will work on different sequences. 

You'll usually try until it gets approved or they take the shot away from you and give it to someone else. Even then it may come back later. Nothing is ever final until the project is delivered, sometimes not even then.

Because of the involved process you want to try and be sure every shot that gets animated is one that's needed, but it does occasionally happen. Much less often than it does in Live Action though.
EDIT: I remember comparing demo reels with the Film students in college, they'd have an hour of awesomely shot and edited footage. Us Animation students would have a couple of minutes tops of character motion.

Hope this helps.

That's what I meant by women speaking up against sexual harassment. I am a woman, and I am speaking up against it, to you, someone who has repeatedly denied that catcalling is sexual harassment.

Telling a woman she's beautiful isn't the same as street harassment. [This site](http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/about/what-is-street-harassment/) is very informative about street harassment. [Here's another non-profit](http://www.ihollaback.org/) trying to spread awareness. Both of these organizations not only define catcalling/street harassment as sexual harassment, catcalling is their main focus. It seems to me like this has never been a serious issue in your life, but it is actually a very hot topic in progressive and/or feminist circles. 

This is a strange debate for me. It's like debating whether or not slapping counts as an act of violence because it's not as bad as punching.

paratactical,AskWomen,1390354218.0,"Where I grew up, the young women I grew up around had two different life philosophies: one strove toward getting out of *here*, as if poverty didn't exist anywhere else that they would get to; another toward finding a sustainable lifestyle, which often relied upon having children. The common refrain in my high school among the latter group was ""if you have three, you get DirecTV."" It wasn't a coniving statement of ill-intent; it was simple truth. Where I grew up, if you had three children supported by the state, you could afford a decent trailer in an okay place and scrape together enough to get a satellite. Some of the young women I grew up with acheived this through deception; most didn't.

Among the men, I think it's that, because of the nature of the place, being capable of actually providing for a family and all of its needs was an enormous signifier of success. There are not many men where I came from that can do this single-handedly. It's not so much about clinging to a gender norm as it is about seeking an obvious, measured goal that so clearly proves worth. I'd venture that there aren't too many men in modern America that can support a family on their income alone; the poor I grew up with just have a perception that being able to do so means that you are a success and not being able to do so means you are a failure. More middle-class individuals have a pretty clear understanding of inherent difficulties in seeking a single-provider situation when it comes to raising a family.

I guess what I'm saying is that low-income *ideals* focus on more traditional gender roles because low-income people tend to have a less realistic vision of the future, its hardships and its difficulties. Low-income people live and grow in a low-income world. They are besieged by media sources and political pundits telling them that if it weren't for this law or that group of people or this issue with the economy, they, too, could have everything. And their vision of what ""everything"" is, is created by those same sources. When you have a false view of a goal, and a false view of a reality, because it is in the interest of those preventing the goal to endorse those false view points, it is incredibly hard to rise above them, establish different normative views and forge on to a real sustainable life path. Moreover, human beings, and Americans, in particular, tend to love a good narrative. In poverty, being capable of supporting a family, or being good at raising one, are concrete, time-tested narratives that are socially and culturally endorsed as postive narrative to pursue.

For what it's worth, this is just drunk pontificating. I was very, very, *very*, **very** lucky to get out of where I grew up. (There are not enough very's or stylistic edits I can make to emphasize this.) Some of the people I grew up with are happy with where they are and what they have. I try not to judge them for enjoying a life style and life position that would make me shoot myself in the face, but that's difficult. I'm a born striver. I always want more. I want better and I want more of it. I'm this way because of my relatively modest upbringing (I was richer than most around me, and didnt' realize how poor I was until I left) and because of my high-school hormone-ridden contempt for complacency. 

These are all huge generalizations, and my observation comes from rural poor America. It's obviously different in other countries and in other poor settings. There's a really great book I read about the urban poor in Philadelphia by a local professor. It followed a main street in the city and talked a lot about the culture of parenthood in impoverish neighborhoods. I'm struggling to remember its name and author, but it was a fucking spectacular read and when I remember it, I'll let you know.

PatHeist,buildapc,1390354373.0,"You absolutely do not need PCIe 3.0. The video card is compatible with up to PCIe 3.0 16x, meaning that it can run in a slot, and potentially utilize the full bandwidth if you were to use it for something that would do so. (There's nothing that would unless it was a program to test how much PCIe bandwidth the card can use). 

PCIe is a scalable interface, meaning your PCIe devices will work in various different slots with various different configurations. The slowest available being PCIe 1.0 (generation 1) 1x (one set of data pins), being able to handle 250MB/s in each direction (that's BYTES, not bits): Meaning that it would be fine for hooking up not one, but two, gigabit ethernet connections.

This bandwidth scales, doubling each generation, and linearly with each set of data pins. So PCIe 1.0 4x is 4x as fast as 1x, and PCIe 3.0 16x is roughly 128 times as fast as PCIe 1.0 1x, being able to theoretically handle 256 gigabit (upload and download) connections, maxed out, at the same time. Moving 31.25 gigabytes of data in each direction per second.

There is really nothing on the market today that fully utilizes that bandwidth. And I mean nothing. (Latency is a different issue, but even then it barely matters.)

Spend more money on a better graphics card instead."

FollowerofLoki,polyamory,1390354400.0,"From your responses, you seem to be more curious about why people don't just alter their relationships to suit their needs. The answer is kind of simple, though easy to overlook. 

People are going to be people and aren't perfect. 

We all have boundaries. Sometimes, you can stretch them, other times you can break them, but some are fast and hard lines. For example, in my own case, I need alone time. I need a lot of alone time, I'm very much an introvert. I can compromise to an extent, but I *need* time to myself, even if it's just to the point of having my headphones on and drawing. 

Sometimes, people find that they just aren't as compatible as they thought they were. Perhaps one partner wants kids and another one doesn't. There's no compromise to be reached there. Maybe one wants to live in the north, or one wants to live further south. That's another incompatibility. 

People aren't perfect. We don't always want to have to alter things when it makes more sense that you could just break things off and find someone better suited. "

Pathogen-David,technology,1390354455.0,"The UAC dialog is shown on a separate virtual desktop (by default) so the only way a program could programatically click on the button is if it was already running with full rights, which it could gain by being run with full rights at least once (when it is installed.)

Unfortunately, the only way this could be fixed is to either:

1. Never allow system services to interact outside the services desktop. (Not realistic - there's legitimate reasons to want to do this.)

2. Display a special UAC dialog when a program wants the rights to add a system service ([Which can run as SYSTEM](http://i.imgur.com/t847HHC.png) - the highest ranked user in Windows.) Unfortunately most people would just click through the special dialog, or get confused by it. Although that being said, I think OS X does this.

MN_Wild_Rice,minnesota,1390354458.0,"I disagree, I think medicinal use, if correctly regulated and enforced, could be a very good thing. Tons of kids are able to buy opiate pharmaceuticals with relative ease- does this mean we should outlaw oxycontin and percoset and leave countless suffering patients out on the curb? I think recreational use MAY cause some problems, hence my caution about it- medical hasn't really been around for long enough to see the pro's and con's of a state that's 'used' to it being in the market for patients.

While it is true, it might not make it harder for kids to get some, this is true for just about every scheduled substance- you're implying the dangerous anti-drug mentality that ""If they can't see it, they won't want it and can't get it"".  The medical use of marijuana is overlooked and often not addressed, leaving it as a sort of shady semi-drug in the eyes of the kids. With regulation, you help clean up the mess of the DARE programs- correct education that doesn't leave them wanting.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390354576.0,"The problem is also that it's supposed to be a gradation. You should get the whole ""equality of the sexes"" and then a bunch of Gender Studies 101. What's intersectionality, internalized sexism, benign sexism, the different waves of feminism, the historical triumphs of suffragettes... all that basic stuff. Then you're supposed to move to theory. Where a professor or at least a grad students hands you a textbook with excerpted basic theory, and you take notes in class and discuss in papers. Then you move to graduate-level criticism. Philosophy of Philosophy sort of meta garbage. Read the entirety of Brownmiller's *Against Our Will*, then we'll meet for our 5-hour discussion class to critique her ideas, particularly the racist implications in this particular chapter. Next week, you're assigned a fictional novel by Russ, and asked to extrapolate the modernist and feminist subtleties from it in a small paper. We'll peer edit and rip each other's ideas to shreds too.

But if you go right from ""equality to the sexes"" to reading Dworkin or something, it's going to look like absolute bullshit. Which is why nobody goes (or should go) from ""I like philosophy, thinking is neat"" to reading Derrida and Hegel unassisted. It's pure lunacy.

I want people to see Gender Studies 101 after the ""equality of the sexes"" phase. Not the internet nonsense, and not the academic bathering I did before I graduated. When the internet attempts at that sort of thing, and then laypeople react to it, it's pure idiocy, from top to bottom.

Which is also related to why science reporting is so bad: laypeople don't see B through Y. They see A (""science is neat!"") and Z (""this study says corn syrup is bad for you"")."

That means he gets up at 5:30 am Sunday-Wednesday does a shift for his online job, then works 8-7.  Then does his other job on his days off.  And he's talking about selling his dad's land which we've held on to, and paid for, since his dad passed almost 9 years ago. And he's talking about buying a new car.

He doesn't have the time or energy to be enthusiastic yet.  He's stuck in the reality of making sure we're OK right now to be OK for later :)"

The video card will have no problem displaying on all three monitors when on the desktop, but might have issues doing all three unless they are the same resolution. If they are the same resolution but different sizes, then what's off on the sides will be smaller, but should display fine. Gaming on 3 monitors will make it run at a lower FPS, but that shouldn't be too huge of a problem either. 

If you want some advice on cutting money here or there, just say so.

Also, get a slightly larger PSU like the CX750 from Corsair and you can SLI that GTX 770 with another one in a few years when you feel like you want a faster system. The CX750 isn't as high efficiency, but it shouldn't be an issue at all, and I believe it's cheaper at the moment. There's also a semi-modular version if you want that. 

If you care about looks at all, I can help you pick out some parts within the same budget that visually fit better with each other. Just say what kind of styles and colors you like."

Once you hook up with a few girls, it gets established among your peers. Be selective though.

I do feel his experiment was flawed because he allowed himself to play video games. A year ago I had a PS3, I sold it when I graduated college because I didn't want to spend too much time on it. Now I don't have a video game problem but I spend just as much time on my laptop. I think once I rid myself of my laptop I would be less tempted to spend four hours at home on my smart phone. That'd be the only piece of tech left in my house. I was hoping when I get bored I could find a better means of entertaining myself other than computers/TV/smartphone.

I have a decent amount of self control on my smartphone; I deleted facebook, snapchat, instagram, twitter and all games about a year ago. I don't really use it much throughout the day aside from calls and texting. So I guess my thought is since I know I can't control myself with a console or computer around I don't think I'll have anything else to fall back on. 

I know if I had a console again I'd overuse it so thats why I don't get one. I haven't recovered from that addiction yet but since I no longer have one its not an issue, so would you say that is bad? "

If I ever see someone like that I just hug them (unless they brush me off) and let them know that I'm there if they need to talk. I don't think there's really anything else you CAN do in that situation apart from making sure they take care of themselves (i.e. that they're eating properly etc, but if she's still working out then that's probably not a problem). Just try not to make a big deal of it and maybe take their mind off it if you can.

I've been the comfortee in that situation before (my uncle died last year) and I didn't tell the group of friends I was living with at the time. Partly because I didn't want to show them that side of me, but mostly because I enjoyed being around them so much. I didn't want that fun to turn into pity and tiptoe-ing aroung my feelings. I wanted to keep my house a place where I could hang around my friends and not be constantly reminded of my uncle.

So unless she specifically asks for help or tears up (or if something bad happens of course), just hang out like you normally do.

I think it's ignorant to claim something is useless. It's like claiming English classes are useless, or that calculus classes are useless. You may not use ALL of the theory in them, but most classes develop skills as well as knowledge, and usually some of the knowledge is useful at least a bit, too.

shelleythefox,AskReddit,1390356050.0,"I'm going to give you a little advice as a chick with big breasts (I'm a 36H). (Sorry, it turned out to be a lot)

When you finally find a woman you want to date/get to know (Please do not use her just to get to her breasts, because that will only make her feel dirty and unlovable), just treat her like a normal, INTELLIGENT human being. I cannot tell you how many times people have assumed I'm a fucking idiot because I have large breasts.

Not only that, but large-breasted women are better at spotting your game. We KNOW when you are talking to our breasts, we've been watching people talk to us like that since they grew. For me, that was at age 11.

We so often get treated like all we're good for is sex or fulfilling some guy's sexual fantasy. In my case that was often the only reason men would talk to me. When we're young and innocent it's very flattering to have men compliment us and tell us we're sexy, but it's old hat by the time we're 20. I got very tired of people viewing me as nothing more than a pair of walking boobs. I was more than that, and I wanted others to see me as more than that as well. I felt I deserved the same intellectual consideration as everybody else, but I wasn't often given it. (I'm still not, but it's better now that I'm a little older. I'm 29)

&gt;I immediately get wrapped up in the idea of hooking up with her, so it shows, and I get nowhere.

Yeah it shows, and to us it makes you just like every other guy who never got over his middle-school immaturity about breasts and sex.

You want to stand out to the woman you are angling for? Have a few intelligent conversations with her. Look her in the eyes, and don't let your eyes drop lower than her chin while you're talking to her. 

Make those conversations your goal. If you don't think she's worth your time for that, then you don't need to bother getting into her clothes, either.

When you're talking to her, don't ever jokingly, flirtily, in ANY way insinuate she's slutty, horny for you, or wants the D. (I'm not saying you would, but I've had a lot of people insinuate it to me, and it just made me want to cry because I'm so not a slut, I've only ever slept with my husband. But people assumed I was slutty anyway.)

The man I married, who gets to grab my tits whenever he wants, was the ONLY one in my entire life who told me ""you're not your boobs"", and he's the only guy who ever bothered to this day to actually get to know me.


**TL;DR:** You want to stand out to the busty woman of your choice? Be respectful, considerate, and treat her like an intelligent human being. You have no idea how rare that can be for women of our physique. "

pathein_mathein,badhistory,1390356368.0,"Confederate - or colonial - apologetics rarely spring from the head of Zeus. They exist for something. If someone decries the Gold Reserve Act as being a plot of the Elders of Zion, it's with an anti-Semitic bearing and generally towards a modern political purpose (e.g. why Bitcoin). The Civil War not being about slavery is generally to assert that the South had a more noble purpose than racism, which then serves a modern political purpose (""thus my southern pride is justified and not racist""; ""thus my fear of federal power is justified"").

The man that thread is about is nuts. He is using bad history to justify his racism and his anarcho-capitalism. He is a bad person. He is a bad anarcho-capitalist. When he says something like ""I oppose letting aborigines or other animal-style human lifestyles have more control over land that they are not using optimally,"" he is not just talking about then, he is talking about now. It's systemic. The bad history is the modern political belief. 

See, I do think that this is where you mock Libertarians - or more accurately here, Anarcho-Capitalists...when they use bad history. It's where you mock feminists, when they use bad history. It's where you mock vanilla Anarchists when they use bad history. It's where you mock MRAs when they use bad history. It's where you mock traffic cops, when they use bad history. It's where you mock Atheists, when they use bad history. 

We mock them because they use bad history to serve their goals. This distinction, to me, seems like, in the terms of my original analogy, that we're trying to say ""look, poke fun at the bad history of the neo-confederates all you want, just don't call them racists because we're not about how they're using the bad history, only the bad history itself.""

I'm finding that, since now that  I'm ""obeying"" pick order always, and basically only getting mid when I'm first/a lucky early pick, that I'm doing worse and losing more often. I can play other champions, and my Leona/Taric game is good, but typically if I'm not playing a carry-able role- I lose.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390356521.0,"&gt;A litany of reasons, from poor character design to bad writing. Additionally I'm not a huge fan of Cranston as a great actor and think he gets way too much attention. Frankly I think he acting is better on Malcom in the Middle, showing more range and I think that Jessie is the better actor on BB, he has to do more heavy lifting and engage a wider range of emotions and reactions.

&gt;As for writing and character, it's very sloppy. Whether it's this ridiculous Gus character who is apparently killable to the point that any old person can just take over the empire (heaven forbid Gus have any kind of pecking order or underling system, ridiculous) to the ridiculousness of the Walt surviving the initial posturing with Tuco.

&gt;Here's an example of sloppy writing in regards to Tuco. They show up at his place and Tuco IMMEDIATELY takes their meth, smashes it with his knife and tries some. Then Walt shows up again with new meth, and this time suddenly tuco doesn't feel the need to test it or sample it, which he is prone to do. Well it's a good damn thing since this is explosive. This inconsistency in character that they themselves made, show the sloppiness of long term planning and character design. Consistency in characters is important and it's bad writing to let 'coincidence' solve your dilemas.

This is actually good criticism. He's using hyperbole when he says that the show is bad, though. He can't really think that if he's spent all that time thinking up criticism and actually watching it. Why the hell would you do that to yourself? When a show gets narmy or just boring, I turn it off. I'll even say it's *good*, and not finish watching it, because I don't particularly care enough.

To say something is bad is to imply that you wouldn't watch it or read it unless compelled to."

JustLetMeComment,explainlikeimfive,1390356829.0,"As others have said, weight transfer and the pushing/pulling effect are parts of it. When the car accelerates, the weight is put onto the rear tires. For drag racing/accelerating, this makes RWD better because you can put more power down. In the corners, RWD also wins because although weight is being transferred off of the front wheels, the rear wheels sort of push the front end down again. This allows a RWD to corner much faster than a FWD. RWD also allows for better weight distribution. One of the best handling cars in the world, the 1st-gen Mazda Miata, is able to have an almost perfect 49.5/50.5 F/R weight distribution because of its drivetrain. RWD is also more controllable if one end of the car loses traction. It's faster to oversteer around a corner than to plow through it understeering, although keeping the tires gripping is still the fastest line. That, in a nutshell, is why RWD is favored by racers."

Life-in-Death,bestof,1390357021.0,"I didn't say 8 hours of new material but 8 hours of performance, meaning that time cannot be used for prepping, grading, data, etc.

Yes, you have 2-4 different classes a day and 1-3 different meetings that have to be prepped for, meaning at least for one it is the same as prepping for a class.  

&gt;time for students to work individually or in groups,

Do you really think students are sitting there self-directing?  Maybe in some schools but not in those which the students are struggling.  You are non-stop circulating, refocussing, and answering questions.

&gt;and quizzes or tests

These are the MOST intense times.  There are usually a minimum of 5 hands in the air at all times.  One day I found 6 kids in one class period cheating.  There has to be CONSTANT monitoring.

I have never had a single moment of class time when I was able to do any work beyond maybe clipping a pile of papers.

&gt;Once you have a few years under your belt in the same subject area 

Yes, but that is not the case in many schools.

My first year was Environmental Science and Senior Health and Advisory  

Then Environmental Science and Regents Chemistry (50% of the kids had never passed algebra or biology) also head of a grade team, and Advisory.  

Then Regents Biology and 2 weeks in a I was assigned a Chemistry class for advanced non-native language students and head of the science department and had a mentee teacher.  And College Prep.  

Then Regents Biology, an ESL Biology, College Prep, a new mentee teacher and head of the science department
Then an immigrant only school (most 9th graders have no English). Biology, (Regents and portfolio project-based), Regents Prep and Advisory and Science Department head  

The next year was second year biology (a completely different curriculum), and the portfolio projects, which you design your curriculum around, happen twice a year and must change every year.  And everything else the same, but as you have your students two years in a row you must change up all of the extra classes too.

And you are forgetting how much differentiation is necessary.  We had to have 2-4 versions of every classwork and assessment to meet the needs of our students.  For Chemistry I had to develop, for every quiz, a high-end quiz, a moderate, a no-language and a no-math version.  None of these could be used the next year.

Also about half your classes are 40% special ed students, which take constant monitoring.  

I think people remember back to their own high school days when we sat in our seats, listened to the teachers, did our work, knew how to read beyond a second grade level, etc.

It is so crazy how much people aren't willing to believe these are some of the conditions out there.  I didn't even include all of the nonsense. What benefit do I have making this up?

When ovens allowed for regulation of temperature, cookbooks started including that instead of a setting. 350 degrees most likely corresponds to one of those original settings. 

Actually, what you'll notice is that even in your oven the temperature isn't equal. A good way to test this is to line a cooking tray with bread. You'll probably see that some parts will burn faster than others, indicating an uneven distribution of temperature. 

Also, the temperature isn't really precise. Most ovens won't measure the temperature exactly as it is, in part due to that uneven distribution of heat. That's why you'll have to figure out the ideal settings on your oven yourself, so that you won't accidentally burn anything. "

[rey-siz-uhm] Show IPA
noun
1.
a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to rule others. 

Maybe the word you all were thinking of is bigot?


big·ot
[big-uht] Show IPA
noun
a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief, or opinion.

Because those 2 words are not the same thing.

My point in this is that if someone uses the N word or any other derogatory word toward someone its because their intent is to hurt that person ... not because they truly believe that ""Some other race is inferior to their own.""

Somewhere along the line society decided that if the N word is used it's automatically racism ... yet every other ethnicity in the world has derogatory terms used against them and the same conclusion is rarely reached

Anyway Yall can down vote me all you want and disagree all you want but **words** don't make people racists... **beliefs** do... and I'm sure everyone here only uses words that have always perfectly coincided with their beliefs and nobody has ever resorted to calling anyone the most hurtful thing you can think of even though you know it's not true.. simply because you wanted to hurt someone."

TC10284,techsupport,1390357435.0,"I don't have any alternatives yet because I use so many of their features - alerting, deployment links, hardware/software reports. I'd like others input on this. 

I wanted to add my comments that I posted on their forum:
&gt; I use Central and LMI pro to manage all my client computers (outsourced IT) and receive alerts when servers go unreachable.


&gt; Right now I'm sitting at right at over 500 computers on my Central account. Looks like I'll be spending countless hours sorting through computers that haven't been online in a long time to delete them JUST so I can avoid being stuck in a higher priced tier...

&gt; Years ago when you took away grouping of computers in LMI Free for no other reason than to entice/force people to purchase Central, I specifically remember your own forum reps saying ""LMI Free will ALWAYS remain free"" or to that effect.
See here: 
http://community.logmein.com/t5/IT-Support-Professionals/No-computer-groups-in-new-Console/td-p/30269/page/2


&gt;Next it was limiting non-Central users to 10 LMI Free computers per account. I ignored this because I w as exempt still.

&gt; Now it's ""buy a subscription or get lost"". 

&gt; Look, I totally understand business expenses and paying for the value of the product. HOWEVER, a few years ago before all this ""taking away"", I purchased Central due to the benefits it provided (grouping, alerting, reporting, deployment links). Then I purchased LMI Pro for servers and other important computers to get hardware reports and alerting.
Why should I be stuck in a higher priced tier and what benefit does this provide to me? 

&gt; Users have been complaining about things being taken away each time this happens, but LogMeIn doesn't buckle to user complaints. They carry on. 
However, I'm personally very close to throwing my hands up with LogMeIn as a whole because of this mess. 

&gt; I'd like to simply ask:
Why?

&gt; What's next to be taken away?

&gt; UPDATE:
After spending 2+ hours going through my entire list of computers in all my groups mind numbingly deleting 159 computers one by one, I've made my decision to find an alternative solution that LogMeIn provides to me. It may be difficult, but I have to. This is just aboslutely ridiculous and inconsiderate of your user-base. 

&gt; First because I'll be stuck in a higher priced tier of $799/year, which was quite a jump from $299/year. I am a small business. I cannot easily afford that kind of a price jump. I would have been paying $1499/year, had I not cleaned out my list. 

&gt; Second because I had to waste all that time deleting computers individually, one-by-one. 
Proof - http://i.imgur.com/zfK8oll.png

&gt; Third, and most importantly because I am sick and tired of LogMeIn taking things away along with price increases. Again I ask, where's the benefit that I'll get from paying more? 

&gt; I dare LogMeIn to ask me to take a user satisfaction survey...

&gt; LogMeIn should scrap this plan and apologize to its users, but we all know that will happen, right?"

&gt;Dear Mayor Lee,

&gt;I wanted to bring your attention to an issue that does not always get talked about but needs to be brought up: blocking the box. Every day, people ride their bikes down Market St. and it is unbelievable how many cars are stuck in the intersection after the light turns red.

&gt;I understand New York City had an initiative called, ""DO NOT BLOCK THE BOX"", where authorities ticketed all drivers who remained ""inside the box"" after a light change. San Francisco already has police standing on the corners directing traffic, so they should be writing tickets to all these careless drivers too. Doing so will alleviate some congestion in the area and make the city a safer place to walk and ride. Considering how dangerous the city is for bikers and pedestrians (SF averages 800 pedestrian accidents each year), I cannot urge the city enough to be stricter with drivers in San Francisco. There is no better place to start than by not ""BLOCKING THE BOX"". This will reduce the number of people running red lights, taking an inappropriate left turn, resulting in fewer injured and killed pedestrians and bicyclists.
 
&gt;Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

I ""texted him, ""  which I really just texted myself replies (had a flip phone) and showed them to my friends. I made a Facebook account for him. I even had my mom friend him on Facebook.

Hitting zero for an operator is not an option although at some point halfway through the maze if you hit zero you get to a random department who then thinks you're an idiot for misdialing.

T0ast1nsanity,AskWomen,1390357694.0,"I wouldn't say ""bond"" because that makes it seem like you have no control over yourself at all. When women have sex, their endorphins rise incredibly- including the ""cuddle hormone"" of oxytocin, dopamine, etc. This gives you a happy cuddly feeling and you want to be close (whereas men have a refractory period and don't necessarily want to cuddle afterwards as much as women do). 


Also, a woman's **primary** motivation for sex is emotional satisfaction and closeness. Please realize I did not say ONLY and that I am not representing outlier populations of women. Because of this, we feel closer to a person often time when we have sex- unless they disgust us or make us feel used and then the reaction can be quite opposite. 

Again, it depends on your levels of hormones and how you feel about yourself. But I think it's all mental. It's what you decide. Don't lie to yourself. Just be honest: is the reason you are having sex for love, lust, physical needs, loneliness, etc. The results after sex can be very different depending."

When I was defeating him, he tried to force me to kill the man I saved, or I would be forced to watch my teammates die. Instead, I let him attack me. It was the most devastating pain I had ever felt in my life, and I have been tortured for days at a time! And then, when I beat his game again, he killed one of his own comrades and nearly killed me!""

That weapon was an innocent girl, the daughter of his former friend, turned into a soulless killing machine! That weapon girl nearly destroyed us all, and I had to help put her down, and watch her be slain by her own father! I carry this cane of hers, which in truth is the most terrible weapon I have ever seen, because I have been injured from standing up to the Rampaging Doctor Seuss and his machinations so many times in the past few days that I can no longer stand on my own!""

im_philbo,sydney,1390357721.0,"Is the idea just to keep people out of the cross?

I think a lot of the problem occurs because of the lack of venues open till late that are close to home.
Let's take a trip back to the early 2000's when the cross was a little bit out of vogue. People where happy to party till 5am at local venues like ""The Tav"" at castle hill, Northies in cronulla, The cow, or Daily planet in Penrith, The Collector, Roxy or even the old Argyle in Parra. There was even the Berry street scene going for a while. If you had gone a bit overboard and were asked to leave, there was usually a bus run by these places, and you'd be home in 30mins. No leitering around outside or wandering packed streets.With such a big range of places to go, no-one bothered heading to the Cross, even going into town for a night out was a big deal, and you'd only do that once or twice a year. The NSW Government was even running ads with the tag line ""Party Local, Stay Safe."" 

Now there is a lot more restrictions on when these suburban venues can be open, and when they can sell booze, along with prohibitive security requirements, everyone heads into the cross at about 10-11pm so they can party all night, and the suburban venues end up dead. 

If a few more of the old suburban venues where allowed, or even encouraged, to trade late, we may avoid the situation on the Cross. "

 I also love video games, it helps me take away the stress that is full-time school and now-part-time work. 

We each play our own games or play multi-player together for anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours until either one of us pokes the other and says that they need attention.
Then, we log off and do fun activities together.

The key here is that we explicitly say when we need attention or need to do something else. And then we go and do it.. good communication is always involved.

I would say try to have something you can occupy yourself for half of his average game playing time and then when you feel you need to have his attention, let him know first and foremost that you are **here for him** and if he wants to play his video games, you'll just go out until he's ready to spend quality time with you."

iheartaegislash,TruePokemon,1390358120.0,"The problem with your move-set is you're running one physical and 2 special moves.

I'd suggest for physical attack:

Petal Blizzard / power whip (depending on how much acc/power you want)

Synthesis

Toxic

Earthquake

(Venusaur doesn't learn any good physical poison moves, so toxic I think would be better on a team of bulky attackers)

Or if you want special

Synthesis / Leech Seed

Venoshock / Sludge Bomb

Energy Ball / Giga Drain

Toxic

First off, even if you don't run sleep powder, running toxic is always great. Venusaur's move pool leaves a lot to be desired, but the point of the above special only set is to either take solid recovery with synthesis and go for a stronger special STAB grass attack in energy ball, or use leech seed and giga drain for recovery. As far as the poison move goes, you have two options, on the synthesis set I'd suggest toxic then venoshock it's an extra turn, but you have synthesis to help counter that and now they're toxic poisoned.

Either way, if you ignore all of my other advice, I'd try to avoid using the current move-set you have having EQ on a special attacker, while it might catch some people off-guard, is a risky move and will only confuse them once before they know it's there.

I'm not an expert, so this is just my opinion, good luck with the venusaur!!"

So my SO, crafty as he is, set him up with another girl and as soon as his friend kissed the girl (literally like 5 minutes later), he made a move on me.

jachryan13,Saints,1390358189.0,"ummm.... no. And I bring data to argue that point.

i don't know how much I trust this [website](http://www.sportingcharts.com/nfl/stats/team-yards-after-catch-statistics/2013/), but it claims we were second in the league in YAC. NFL website shows that we were also second in the league in passing yards in the regular season and top 6 in yards per attempt. (NFL official stats [here](http://www.nfl.com/stats/team?seasonId=2013&amp;seasonType=REG&amp;Submit=Go) 

The bigger problem is that we are 25th in rushing (and 25th in average per attempt). Every bad Saints game I've watched in recent years has either been because the defense was bad at bad times, or because we couldn't run the ball when we really needed to (like the end of the Patriots game this year). Because of that, we get pass in predictable situations, and not many teams get away with that in this league.

As much as people love the passing offense, don't forget that in 2009 when we won the super bowl, we were 4th overall in passing and sixth in rushing. We need balance back more than we need more passing weapons.

My professional advice would be to pick another datastore.  However, I'm assuming you're mostly using this to learn MongoDB.  Which is fine!  So that said...

There's two main ways of doing this; a document per set, or a document per card.

## Document per set
----
    {
       ""name"": ""Arabian Nights"",
       ""releaseDate"": ""1993-12-01"", 
       ""type"": ""expansion"",
       ""cards"": [
         {
           ""types"":[
              ""Creature""
           ],
           ""colors"":[
              ""White""
           ],
           ""name"":""Abu Ja'far"",
           ""subtypes"":[
              ""Human""
           ],
           ""rarity"":""Uncommon"",
           ""artist"":""Ken Meyer Jr."",
           ""power"":""0"",
           ""toughness"":""1"",
           ""manaCost"":""{W}"",
           ""text"":""When Abu Ja'far dies, destroy all creatures blocking or blocked by it. They can't be regenerated."",
         },
         {}, {}, ...
       ]   
     }

And then you have another big document for each other set, and you shove them all in a collection.  This works okay.  You may, depending on how you want to use the data, struggle a bit with the documents being so large.  For static data (like magic cards) it might be okay, but you probably wouldn't want to store an email inbox this way, with emails as nested subdocs in a list; every time you need to add or remove an email you have to resave the entire document (and perhaps push updates to other clients).  You can tack on some magic to try and just push deltas, and mongo has some support for atomic, in place updates, but the whole approach will be a struggle.  Again, may not be an issue with a MTG card DB, but if you are trying to send atomic updates across the network to distributed clients, what do you do if a client misses an update?  Now you need to have sequential numeric IDs on your updates, and store them in an oplog, and let clients query to see what updates they're missing, and...ick.  And while CouchDB supports all this out of the box via the _changes feed, Mongo does not; you'll write a ton of ugly plumbing code if you have to go down this road.

## Document per card (denormalized)
----
    {
      ""types"":[
        ""Creature""
       ],
       ""colors"":[
          ""White""
       ],
       ""name"":""Abu Ja'far"",
       ""subtypes"":[
          ""Human""
       ],
       ""rarity"":""Uncommon"",
       ""artist"":""Ken Meyer Jr."",
       ""power"":""0"",
       ""toughness"":""1"",
       ""manaCost"":""{W}"",
       ""text"":""When Abu Ja'far dies, destroy all creatures blocking or blocked by it. They can't be regenerated."",
       ""set"":{
          ""name"": ""Arabian Nights"",
          ""releaseDate"": ""1993-12-01"",
          ""type"": ""expansion
       }
     }

And then you make a document like this for every card from every set and throw *that* into a collection.  (Optionally:  One collection per set, if you want to keep them seperated.  Makes it easier to deal with one set at a time; makes it harder to search across all sets.)  Now you have lightweight, svelte documents to be thrown across the network with gay abandon.  Except...you now have denormalized data.  Which is fine, but you have a big task if you ever want to edit any of it.  Keep in mind, NoSQL DBs aren't so good at atomic commits or transactions, so now you have to worry about, eg, starting to edit a set name and having the network hickup halfway through, and now half your cards are in the ""Arabian Nights"" set and half are in the ""Arabian Knights"" set.  :)

Also, it bloats your data store a bit.  Not that bad if you're just storing a data and a set name; but the more stuff you want to store about the set, the more of a hassle it is to duplicate that on every card.  So in short, much like the last option, this will probably work fine for what you're doing, but it's not without issues.  (CouchDB, incidentally, lets you define what they call ""list functions"" which let you work around these issues; you can actually keep the data normalized on disk, return denormalized data to queries, and update all set info by editing a single set doc.  Kind of magic...but, again, MongoDB doesn't support this.)

I'd lean towards the first option for a magic card reference site, probably, but it really depends what you're doing.  If your data is going to be really static then denormalization won't be a concern.  Then again, if it's that static, just make a script to generate the JSON blobs, throw them onto S3, stick Cloudfront in front of it, and off you go.  Call it a NoNoSQL option.  :)  If you need more than static files on S3 can provide then, well...what?  Editing?  Full text search?  Being able to create custom decks by referencing your DB docs?  What?  Your needs will determine what the best architecture is.

Oh, and then there's:

## Document per card (normalized):
    {
      ""rtype"": ""card"",
      ""types"":[
        ""Creature""
       ],
       ""colors"":[
          ""White""
       ],
       ""name"":""Abu Ja'far"",
       ""subtypes"":[
          ""Human""
       ],
       ""rarity"":""Uncommon"",
       ""artist"":""Ken Meyer Jr."",
       ""power"":""0"",
       ""toughness"":""1"",
       ""manaCost"":""{W}"",
       ""text"":""When Abu Ja'far dies, destroy all creatures blocking or blocked by it. They can't be regenerated."",
       ""set"": ""5270c7b11f6a02100a000001""
     },
     {
       ""_id"": ""5270c7b11f6a02100a000001"",
       ""rtype"":""set"",
       ""name"": ""Arabian Nights"",
       ""releaseDate"": ""1993-12-01"",
       ""type"": ""expansion
    }

Now we have a bunch of card docs (in a card collection, no doubt), and a bunch of set docs (in a set collection), and if we want to know the name or release date of a card all we need to do is look at the ID stored in the set key, then request the set doc identified by that key, and then find the string reference by the name key, and there we go.

**Don't do this.**  You're basically trying to write your own database on top of MongoDB inside your app code, and you will rue the day you ever went down this path.  This design pattern requires joins, and there are plenty of databases that support this, including plenty of NoSQL databases (eg, CouchDB, which would cheerfully solve this entire thing via a trivial map/reduce function).  But MongoDB does not support joins, and writing your own join code is madness.

Hopefully that helps a little.  :)

TL;DR:  MongoDB is a, um...interesting choice for this, but you can make it work.  I might go with one big doc for each set, with cards embedded within it, or maybe one doc for every card, with set info duplicated in every card.  There's tradeoffs both ways.  If you want to be able to easily reference individual cards, *and* the set data is highly static, then you might be best off with the latter option.

Edit 1:  Also, MongoDB has document size limits of, I believe, 16mb.  Individual cards won't hit that, but some set documents with embedded cards might for really big sets if you include rulings, annotations, etc.  Just be careful.

Bassically,nfl,1390358324.0,"Texas A&amp;M Aggie here. We have organized chants we call ""yells."" We have five students in all-white outfits down on the field who use hand signals to tell us what chant to use and the cadence. The yells themselves are team-specific (""Farmers Fight"" and ""Old Army"" commemorate our heritage as a ag school and military academy). Because of the hand signals giving us the timing, we can be way louder and more complex than the ubiquitous ""De-Fense"" chant. The results is that the yells are loud, unified, and very easily distinguishable.

There's nothing like an A&amp;M game coming back from the commercial break and hearing ""Beat the hell outta (whoever we're playing that week)!"" clear as day.

To answer your question, I think that American universities are places where the fans mostly all live or have lived in one town at some point. The geographic concentration of these people (and them being at an impressionable point in their lives) makes it easier to teach them these chants and have them accept them, while pro football teams draw fans who don't have those shared experiences."

MikeyDeez,relationships,1390358413.0,"It really does seem like we have a *lot* less mandated obtrusiveness. 

If we need or want it, there are unique information-gathering provisions we have ike HIPAA exemption, partial mandated reporting, and assuming client's best interest.

However, we only have to work as far as our client wants us to. An APS case can be very stressful (and usually the most stressful) when a well executed investigation is completed and grandma declines services because crack-boy the grandson *swears* this time he'll change...but its easier to cope with wasted time than having broken up a family.

 As you stated; informed adults have the right to bad-decisions. We have a month to investigate like CPS but afterwards we have the follow up casework period, as well as set funds available to help our clients.  

I can see how having such strict timelines and *heavy* authority would complicate this situation. 

**Edit: Just to humor you because work was slow today:**

Week one:
-
* Begin investigation, make initial FTF with client.

* Refer AV to The Division of Mental Health in The Department of Human Services.

Week Two:
-
* Interview family. Ideally mom is not dysfunctional and expresses desire to change.

* Consider police action with client. At best, a judge might grant an order of protection against the mother. This would order mom to vacate premises for 72 hours, afterwards providing provisions for immediate detention for unlawful contact between the two. Personally, I'd advise against this with a remorseful AA but the option is there. Maybe a restraining order with no intent to enforce? I couldn't advocate for that, but if AV did and just wanted it as an emergency escape plan, luckily APS are partial mandated reporters.

* Consider alternative housing for AV. DHS would probably take this over eventually anyways, although it might take more than three weeks to ""kick in"".

Week Three:
-
* AV doesn't want to pursue police/court action!

* Substantiate abuse. Refer A to counseling, caregiver support groups. I'm assuming I might refer either A or V to their local NAMI.

* Follow up with DV and DHS referrals. DHS will follow her from child-adolescent-adult. I'm assuming various DV resources would too, provided V stick with them.

I think this is a reasonable amount to accomplish in three weeks, although it does assume some best case scenarios...*but luckily that's all we have in Candyland!* ;)

I've never been overweight, but all through public school, I ate junk food and consumed soda or other sugary drinks. I was tired all the time, and when I was in high school, I think I was asleep for 3/4 of freshman and sophomore year.

My mom finally took me to a doctor, and he suggested I eat nutrient-rich foods, reduce the amount of snacks I ate, and think of soda as a treat, not a daily drink. I threw the typical teenager tantrum, but my mom promised to eat healthier with me as long as I would try it. So, by appealing to hormone-induced schadenfreude, my mom and I ate less, ate smarter, and kept eachother in check.

And lo and behold, after only two weeks, I was able to stay awake in class and stop failing by thinking of food as fuel.

Of course, I'm not the best to defend sociology. My degree is in Philosophy. I took sociological courses, all of which dealt pretty heavily with statistics and research once you got past the framework. Statistics was a prerequisite past 200 level.

Then again, you're attacking an entire academic tradition as fundamentally useless, in a moral sense. To my knowledge, that's not the sort of thing that flies if I wanted to deny the application of physics, even if I was doing it a philosophy department mixer. No, that sort of petty elitism is pretty much reserved for STEM majors who fancy themselves nihilists.

If you're such a nihilist, may I ask you a question? Can I murder someone, dismember them, and then piss on their exposed brain tissue as a symbol of contempt for the non-cognitivism of human attachment to ethical notions? Would that titillate you, move you, disgust you?"

ZFS cannot expand a vdev (eg. a RAID-Z1) but what you can do is add another vdev with similar performance characteristics to expand the pool.  This has the benefit of being basically instant, but requires you to buy 3 or 4 disks to expand and also leaves the pool utilization lopsided (most new writes will go to the new vdev to try and even things out).

Pretty much all RAID 5 implementations from the past decade allow the addition of one disk at a time and will rewrite all the data as a part of that process.  This can take a long time but it means you only need to buy one disk to expand.

In either case I'd strongly recommend against RAID 5 or Z1 with 3TB disks.  The rebuild time is long enough that if you have a failure you might experience a second before the rebuild is complete."

I don’t blame her as much for not understanding its sexual function (smooth, frictionless movement) as that’s not necessarily obvious.

It’s particularly unfortunate as I’m only interested in non-penetrative sexual activity—where the foreskin makes a huge difference, and I’m a two-showers-a-day, wash-rinse-moisturize-repeat kind of girl¹.

Well-sourced comments about anything are useful everywhere, of course -- my initial question looks kind of stupid as it stands. I'll explain what really bothered me.

The point of your post here in this subreddit was to counter-balance reactionary Armenian votes with reactionary Turkish votes, and I find that utterly pointless. Your upvoters aren't likely to be more informed and less biased on the subject than your downvoters. Your fishing for upvotes was what triggered my reaction, because it makes it seem like the comment score would be indicative of anything regarding the subject matter. My objection was that if you wished for an actual discussion of the matter instead of a vote-war, the route you followed wasn't the right one. 

Parts that I don't agree with are parts that don't match the sources I've seen previously (re: the number of Armenians being allowed to return, them not being killed on spot and being provided with proper food and shelter etc.). I don't know which sources would be more reliable, but I've had two arguments with you about recent Turkish history on topics I'm more informed on than the massacres of 1915, and your reliability doesn't run very high with me. I've also found those arguments to be quite fruitless, so I'm not willing to invest the time to engage in yet another one."

RichardBehiel,spacex,1390358777.0,"Very good point about including the lander mass, which I left out of my comment.  I remember reading somewhere that the gross mass of the Apollo lunar module (including crew and supplies but not including the command/service modules) was approximately ~~10,000lbs~~ 33,000lbs, and that delivered people + spacesuits + other supplies/instruments/equipment to the moon *and then came back*.  Granted, not all of it came back.

Still, if 10,000 lbs can land an Apollo mission on the moon and then even bring something back, and the Falcon Heavy can put that much mass (if not more) into TLI, then just *landing* a ~1,000-lb payload on the moon should be well within reach. 

Additionally, it seems like this type of mission wouldn't require a service module (robots don't need food/air) or command module (no return trip = no need to rendezvous), so that cuts literally tons of mass out of the equation.

I'm not trying to downplay the difficulty of performing a soft landing, especially on another celestial body, but the payload mass that NASA mentioned definitely seems to make things easier.  "

The OB/GYN I went to at the time said the same thing.  That some women are just irregular and as long as you have some a year, you're fine.  It's natural.  

She said I have enlarged ovaries and produce a low amount of estrogen.  I have no idea if that contributes to it or not but I'd like to think the lack of estrogen is part of it.

It's totally fuckin' awesome not to have one every month and when it does happen, my body tells me when it's coming and I've just learned to listen to it and read the signs and I can usually catch it.

The downside is it's not your friend if you are unsure if you're pregnant or not and are waiting for it."

gyrorobo,gaming,1390358921.0,"There are plenty of weapons and items to collect while going through the game that can boost you attacks. Plenty of different classes that each character can be which makes building your team extremely fun and rewarding.

This game also introduces marriages between characters, when two characters are become married you have the option to retrieve the ""child"" character from the future and they will have the passed down traits of the parents. Basically the kids are the most powerful characters in the game and you can freely mold what they will be like by marrying different characters.

The Dialogue between characters is both hilarious and fun, and the story is written well and engaging enough to keep you playing till the end easily.

The combat is pretty fun, you can tag team people together and they will build their relationship as well as make each other more powerful as long as they stay ""partnered"", in which you can separate at any time."

buzzing_noise,Paleo,1390358930.0,"I'll try to go from memory but it's not in the best shape. I can never remember things.

For the past 4 days, I've eaten eggs mostly for breakfast. Saturday and Sunday, they were hardboiled eggs with tomatoes on the side. I finally went grocery shopping on Sunday so I had more to choose from. I also had an avacado for the first three days with breakfast.

On Monday, I had a leek omelette and this morning I had ground beef with eggs over top.

On Saturday for both lunch and dinner I had some lamb just cooked in a pan with olive oil and seasoning and about half an eggplant, some mushrooms and peppers baked in the oven.

Sunday was no lunch but I went to a dinner party where I had three chicken drumsticks (I couldn't eat the steak they had as it was seasoned with salad dressing), a potato filled pepper and sauerkraut as a salad (They didn't have a regular salad that wasn't seasoned with Ranch and I didn't want to impose)

On Monday, for lunch, I had the leek omelette leftovers because I couldn't eat all I made for lunch, with some grape tomatoes, and a couple of mandarins as a snack.
Dinner was salmon and roasted veggies as pictured [here](http://i.imgur.com/bkPLt8e.jpg). I was told that it's not enough veggies and am looking to eat more.

Today, I didn't have time for lunch so I had a salad wrap with ground beef in it and grape tomatoes (I know I should've had more but I was running out of the house and didn't have time to prepare). Also had some blackberries as a snack at school.


I have been snacking on almonds and bananas. I had a piece of unsweetened baking chocolate today because PMS and cravings. 

That's pretty much it."

FrustratedChef,AskMen,1390358968.0,"It really depends on a lot of things - I'll give you a quick story and then my perspective.

I'm a chef - it has been an issue before in the past, because I love to cook, and I didn't always cook healthy, especially when I was trying to show off.  So I'd be in a relationship and cooking all this food, we'd eat too much, and then weight would be gained. I dated this girl, and she blew up (it was partly medically related), and so did I.  We still had sex, but we were definitely less attracted to each other.  She was less willing to initiate and really get excited about sex.  But we were also a lot bigger than our former selves - she was pretty thin when we started, and I was overweight but nothing crazy.  Afterward, she was pretty big and I was way bigger than I ever should have been.  In the beginning, there was obviously attraction, but it was lost when we changed so significantly.  Actually, this happened more than once.  I used to have a habit of fattening people up (now I help them lose, ha!).  But in my experience, the women I dated would definitely become less attracted if I lost weight.  I don't think it's a gender thing, it's just based on the individual.  

The way I see it, you're attracted to what you're attracted to.  Personality makes someone more attractive, but if they change, it could still change your perception, and that should be okay.  A little fluctuation or some slow gaining isn't really a huge deal, and doesn't bother me in the slightest.  But if someone is incredibly different than when you met them, it's not surprising that you might lose attraction.  For example, if my girlfriend suddenly went bald tomorrow, should I be expected to be attracted to her just because we have a good relationship?  I would say absolutely not.  I'm not saying I shouldn't be attracted to her in that case, but it's totally acceptable if I wasn't, at least not as much, after something like that.  

Also, I made a similar comment earlier, but I would say that most people aren't attracted to people based on their own body.  In other words, even when I was a bigger guy, I didn't like bigger women - I preferred more petite women.  So the fact that he isn't small is irrelevant."

Slightly better video card, the CPU has more cores and will perform better in games that can use that, slightly worse in games that can't. The PSU is better and larger capacity, and you should be able to just get another GTX 660 a few years from now when you want to upgrade. The RAM is cheaper and will give you the same performance. The hard drive is the newer version of the same thing, and slightly cheaper. The case is better all 'round, unless you really don't like how it looks. Most things have been changed a little bit, but it's essentially the same in spirit. 

Throw in a CPU cooler if you want to look at overclocking.

""What?"" You looked into his black eyes and saw your face reflected back.

""My fault, friend, didn't meana wake y'up an' stuff,"" he shuffled backwards toward your door. ""Just uh, think about your Gramm's chicken parm or your eighth birthday when ya Dad surprised you with that green Nintendo Sixdy Four and those games an' stuff,"" he said as he was closing the door on his way out. ""Good happy things, ya know?""

""Wait,"" you tell him. ""How do you know that? That I got a green 64 on my birthday?"" He crept back into your room with his head down.

""Aah, umm,"" he stammered, ""Its a, uh, lucky guess ya know? I mean, come on, everyone had onna them, okay?""

""A black one, maybe, not a green one."" 

""Look man, just go back to sleep and you'll wake up in three hours for that job of yers. Please, this is just some dream an' stuff,"" he pleaded with you as you stared at him with disbelief. He stood there, waiting. His eyes were inhuman, but he was dressed to the nines. Black pin stripe suit with a red tie and silver handkerchief. When you got out of bed he took a step back, keeping his distance like a cat.

""How do you know about my Gramm's chicken parm?"" you demanded.

""Well you come from an Italian family, comes with the territory,""

""Yea, but Gramm was Irish, dude,"" you corrected him. ""What the hell is going on?""

""Ah, dammit,"" he said. ""Look man, its my first day on the job, just gimme a break and get in ya bed and go to sleep, ya know?""

""What job? A spy or some shit?"" you walked forward and he mirrored you backwards.

""Death,"" he firmly said. ""Grim Reaper, *Beelzebub*, The Devil,"" he finger quoted, ""but whatever, you get the picture,""

""Your first day on the job?"" you asked him, ""As Death?""

""Eh, its complicated, basically, you take ""X"" amount of people and your saved,"" he explained. ""When I died, I was given the option"" he went on. ""Either eternal damnation, or I sign the contract,""

""So, you kill somepeo-""

""The preferred nomenclature is take. It sounds more family friendly, ya know?"" He told you while pulling out a cigarette. ""Ya mind?""

""Nah, its cool, go ahead,"" you responded as he lit it at took a smooth drag. The two of you stood there in silence for a moment.

""So, tonight are you going to, um, take me?"" you asked. His black eyes met yours.

""Not tonight. Its just watch duty for now."" he said.

""Watch duty?""

""Well, we make sure to be there the moment we need to take you, so we have employed a sorta night watchman kinda system,""

""Ah,"" you nodded in agree agreement. ""How'd ya know all that stuff about me?""

""We've got a file on everyone. Every sin, laugh, love, and memory all stowed away on one convenient file.""

""Huh, that makes sense,"" he tell him. ""You said you signed a contract after you died. Why?"" He took a long drag from his cig and thought about it. Smoke covered his face as he exhaled.

""What you do here,"" he motioned around him, ""matters there,"" he said pointing down.

""Oh,""

""Yea. I did some things in my time, not the greatest track record, ya know?"" he said. ""I did a few crimes, robbed, raped a girl when I was young."" He paused, ""I killed a guy."" Both of you stood there in a silent understanding. ""I repented though. Turns out more to just asking for forgiveness,""

""What do you mean?""

""What I'm doing know is to prove what I said on my deathbed,"" his eyes looked deep into yours. ""Penance needs payment in the otherworld, and this is it, ya know?""

""I think I get it,""

""Good. I don't ever wanna work with you, alright?""

""Yea,"" you reassured him. ""Can I ask about the get up?""

JonWood007,socialism,1390359120.0,"I'm not a socialist, but I've been lurking your sub for the last few days out of curiosity, and having dealt with many ancaps on reddit, I feel like I should explain it a bit. 

Anarcho capitalists are basically libertarians who take their ideas to the extreme. While libertarians want to shrink the size of government and lower taxes, anarcho capitalists want to completely eliminate the state, who they see as ""men with guns"" who have a ""monopoly on violence"", and see the idea of taxation as theft, property as a sacred right, and wealth redistribution as totally evil. They constantly call moderate liberals and social democrats as marxists, and have little to no understanding of the left wing at all except that it's bad.

To answer your questions in particular:

&gt;If corporations (large private entities) have indirect control of the government as in the U.S., what makes our current system so different from an ideal anarcho-capitalist system?

In practice, the fact that there would be no constitution, no rights no separation of powers to place limits on what corporations can do. Ancaps believe mistakenly that in the absence of government, businesses would act in accordance with free market principles and the non aggression principle, but, as most leftists of all stripes know, this is pretty much a freaking lie and that the corporations would run the show and not be afraid to throw their weight around.

&gt;In anarcho-capitalism, what is to prevent disparities in wealth?

They would argue competition. Without government to have ""enforced"" monopolies, anyone could start a business and compete and yada yada yada. They believe the free market would make it all even out in the end.

&gt;In anarcho-capitalism, is equality less important than an individual's right to property?

Yep. They treat property practically as sacred, and could care less about inequality. Their views are about ""freedom"". They believe in voluntary transactions in accordance with 'free market principles"". They don't believe in mandated minimum wages, for example, they believe these should be hammered out between employers and employees, etc. Some will argue that their ideal system would contain freedom of opportunity, but considering how their ideal system isn't well thought out and seems based on the fuzzy overly generalized models of an econ 101 textbook, eh. In short, no equality is not a priority at all. If you have wealth, you've earned it and worked for it, and it's yours and any attempt to force equality is basically the equivalent of men with guns coming to their houses and ""stealing"" from them. I've had conversations with ancaps where I bring up reforms that to you guys would seem mild, like, you know, a basic income, or really, anything to do with taxes, and next thing you know these guys are ranting and raving about North Korea's body count. 

Also, if you think I'm exaggerating, here's a video by Stefan Molyneux, one of the more prominent ancaps, saying that if you support the state and taxation you literally support him getting shot.

Ekotar,rawdenim,1390359175.0,"Can we have a registry of users based on which pair(s) they own?

So much of this subreddit is beginners asking for advice on which pair to buy, or people far from major cities/denim stores looking for reviews of a particular pair they're looking to buy. Other than contacting blueowl/BiG/SelfEdge, people here often ask owners (particularly those who have had the jeans a year or more) to review particular pairs.

With this in mind, I'd like to set up a Google Document to put in the Sidebar for new users/current shoppers that has a list of usernames for each style (although there are many) so that people looking to *specifically* contact an owner, instead of self-posting on this sub can contact an individual who owns that pair. I also think that it would be useful to sidebar reviews of popular pairs (3sixteen 100x, APC New Standards, N&amp;F Elephant 2/3, Unbranded 101 and 121, etc) so that users can find the best/most upvoted reviews of each pair, as Reddit's search algorithm isn't optimal for this.

I can't speak to what others do, I can only answer for my own actions.  I skimmed what he had posted and offered you my assesment of the OP's situation.   I would bet dollars to doughnuts that there was a whole lot of 'trickle truth' going on in that confession to him.

&gt;And that justifies asserting that the ONLY relationships that work are ones in which the woman is made to be submissive, the man is ruthlessly selfish, and no consideration is made of what the woman herself wants. Got it.

No.  You are asserting that.  They are simply defining the relationships that they want.  They are listing the ideals they look for in a woman and I don't have any problem with that.  ""To each their own"" right?  Who are you to say they cannot do that?  I do not attempt to define what you do and do not want in a potential relationship and I actually find it quite appalling that you feel so justified in defining mine.

&gt;Know what you mean. Them mad wimminz, wanting to be treated as individual people instead of some sort of alien species with a completely uniform mindset about everything. They so crazy, amirite?

Attempting to put words into my mouth do not make them true.  Of course we are all individuals.  But that doesn't make us 'special'.  That term is thrown around too broadly these days.  It's what we accomplish that makes us special, not simply existing.

&gt;If you're as reasonable as you claim to be, you should be admitting that some members of this community you consider yourself part of are expressing reprehensible opinions, not scrambling desperately about trying to make them sound rational.

Some peoples views are much more rigid than others.  This is true no matter the faith or belief.  That being said, I think there is some value in this.  These people are so focused in their vision that sometimes they can see what others cannot.  It is up to the individual to judge what he reads, hears or sees."

gyrorobo,gaming,1390359205.0,"Fire Emblem Awakening literally has endless possibilities for character growth. Many of the normal characters can be a few different classes just like the old games, but Awakening introduces a partnering system where you can build relationships between characters that fight together.

It also introduces Marriage, when two characters are married they have a ""child"" and you can retrieve this child from the future and use them as part of your team during the game. The children gain two skills from the mother and two skills from the father which allows you to create an assload of different kids with different abilities, even ones that they may not usually be able to get due to class limits.

I'd say most of my time was spent researching and building the perfect team, partners, and kids. I find a lot of joy in just creating one team that completely destroys everything in it's wake.

keakealani,singing,1390359294.0,"I definitely practice frequently with a metronome. Even if I may take a few tempo liberties later, it's very helpful to be able to keep time - and truly, rubato when done correctly should always result in ending back up at the same tempo you started. The only way metronomes aren't helpful is when the tempo genuinely changes or you're singing in a bunch of mixed meters, but it can still be helpful to have a metronome going just to internalize the pulse and be sure you're counting all your rests accurately. 

I also really encourage you to record the accompaniment. In a pinch, even plopping it into Finale/Sibelius and singing with the MIDI playback isn't terrible - knowing, of course, that that's not how your real accompanist can sound, you can still learn how your entrances sound and get a feel for the way your part fits together. 

I also recommend learning the piano part for at least your entrances (maybe 1-2 measures before you come in depending on tempo). Even if you're not an amazing pianist (goodness knows I'm anything but) it can really help you both to play your entrances as you practice, and also to put in that extra time to study it and internalize what it sounds like. 

If your piano skills are good enough - play with yourself singing (sometimes). It's good to work on things alone so you can focus 100% on the singing, but it's also helpful to play with yourself and know what is going on in your accompaniment. If you can't play the whole accompaniment, try playing just the left hand while singing, or reduce it to lead sheet notation and just pulse block chords or bass notes. Whatever harmonic context you can give yourself, really. 

Finally, *sing* your accompaniment. Obviously some might not be in your range or make sense for your voice, but as much as possible, try to approximate what is happening. Ideally, you should be basically singing the accompaniment in your head as you sing your part aloud, so that you have a good idea mentally of how everything is fitting together even without actually hearing it all. 

Anyway, I think this is a big issue for many singers, but with a little practice you should be fine :)"

Sometimes you get a lucky Chang with 10% - it doesn't make for forgiving hangovers.

Other than that, Heineken, San Miguel and Carlsberg are common as well. The craft beer scene is on the up and coming in Bangkok, but only Bangkok. I actually went to the first beer festival in Bangkok this past October where there were lots of breweries promoting their beers. And there are a few companies who are trying to promote microbreweries from across South East Asia. Ultimately, its not impossible to find good beer - but it is really expensive!"

not_impressive,TheBluePill,1390359435.0,"Since the other thread questioning /u/IllimitableMan 's heterosexuality was declared redundant, we need to bring the party here:

""Oh, Roosh"" whispered IllimitableMan, stroking the disgustingly greasy hair of his secret true love. ""I-I don't know how you'll react to this, but I'm starting to think that I chose wrong. I know it's morally better to be straight, but I just can't hide it any more. I climbed every mountain in the world, and I fought dangerous animals, and negged HB10s, *but the feelings didn't go away*.""

""What?"" said Roosh, as he slowly began to realize what his best friend was saying to him. *It can't be*, he thought. *It was supposed to only work on women*. 

IllimitableMan continued. ""I...*I love you*. I've denied it for so long. I thought I could conquer it.  Many times I thought I *did*. But every time I saw your [beautiful smile](http://i.imgur.com/NGjTD8p.jpg), it all fell apart. Please! Please say you love me too. To women, you're just another cock on the carousel, but to me, you're the most wonderful person I've ever met. Can your blowup doll keep you warm at night? Does *she* feel a little thrill of joy every time she sees a mustard jacket? Please don't friendzone me, Roosh! I love you! It feels so good to finally say it. I truly, truly do. You'll break my heart if you say no.""

Roosh realized that there was no way he could just reject this man the way any feminazi bitch on the street would. It would be positively cruel. He had to lie. He had to protect a fellow alpha's heart. Slowly, the words rose to his lips. ""I.. love... you... too."""

fnredditacct,changemyview,1390359441.0,"I have personally experienced this and think I can help out a bit. I was actually surprised by this and didn't expect it to bother me, yet it did.

Firstly, deviance is NOT an issue for me. I am not someone who experiments. I am not someone who likes to spice things up. I am someone whose primary arousal deviates from the norm. Specifically, I'm primarily aroused by fear, *(not by peoples' bodies/genders)* feeling fear, seeing fear, something to fear. This manifests mostly in consensual non-consent. Which means I'm open to many fetishes most people find distasteful, in fact, that I myself find distasteful, and so fear.

I am not shocked by the content of suggestions that anyone could throw my way.

Volume is also not a huge issue for me, I ignore messages if I can't get to them. I don't worry much about if I miss someone good, because I don't actually need them. My needs are completely met (by husband and current play partners) and everything new I look for is really just adding extra cherries to my delicious scary sundae.

But content and volume *are* actually important, just not the way you thought.

What I have found *quite* unsettling is the percentage of messages that have this property:

They are written in such a way that I, the recipient of the message, am completely irrelevant, yet necessary for reception of it.

What I mean by this is that I am needed to read the message, *(possibly also to respond, but not necessarily)* but who I am is not all important.

And the content? Purely fap material. Written just for them to get off on writing, sending to ""me,"" and having ""me"" read. *(Obviously never read my profile, doesn't mention anything specific to me, my interests, doesn't engage conversation or propose real interaction, is all just ""I would so do this and that and have you do..."" like one sided sex talk)*

Now, this might not sound like much. But it begins to feel weird and upsetting fast.

That is because, *(at least for me),* it shows a willingness to use me, (my time, my energy, my ability to open up to people by posting on a site in the first place, my desire to make connections), just for the purposes of getting off. Without engaging with who I am in any way.

Which, you know what? Isn't so bad. The first time. Wanker. 

Or the second time. Idiot. His profile actually makes him look like someone I'd want to play with, he doesn't even know what he's missing by this behavior.

Or maybe the third time.

But then you notice these are a large minority of messages received.

And you start to wonder...

Just what portion of male population that I talk to and work with and am friends with would use me so casually if they could?

If they could be anonymous? If they had the chance to completely ignore me, what I like, when I like it, and could use me to get off when they wanted, how many would?

Then you think, nah. No way. Sure there are creeps. Sure there are guys that leave me alone because they'd get in trouble if they didn't. But that can't be most guys.

It can't even be as many as my inbox would suggest! I'm sure they are just being so noisy as to drown out the non-creeps. The ones who never message me, because we're incompatible, or the ones that are taking their time, to read my profile, and the profile's of others.

But they keep coming. And in volume. And not just from the same guys! 

And you begin to doubt again.

How safe am I just because the law is the law?

How dangerous are (edit: some) men if they can get away with it?

That is thought. That is what becomes unsettling. 

**TL;DR: Explained why deviance and (plain) volume are NOT the problem I have. Issue is the volume of messages that just use me to get off. Which, after a time, (as I illustrate) makes me wonder how many men would use me so casually if they could, anonymously, with no consequences? It forces me to wonder how dangerous men can be, and the nature of my safety.** 

edit: added tldr

**edit 2:** Women can also be horrible people. But they don't send me these messages. So I am not reminded by these messages about how horrible women can be.

**edit 3 for clarity Type of message discussed:** 

I am going to give a quick example of the type of messages I am referring to.

I am NOT talking about every time I am contacted by a man.
I am NOT taking about every time a messages suggests that man is interested in me, or even wants to do something to me or with me.

So I am NOT talking about anything similar to these:

* ""Hey, I think we have something in common, I want to get to know you better."" *Even though this doesn't specify me in anyway, this is perfectly fine, I have no issue with this.*

* ""I wanna fuck you. Message me if you want."" *Still okay. This message is beginning a conversation. Even if a bit harshly.*

I am only referring to messages where the man (I haven't gotten one from a woman, but it would be equally upsetting) talk AT me, not TO me, and don't suggest anything about my response, or contacting them back. Like this:
 *(I'm replacing the kinky content of my messages with more regular sex so as not to confuse the issue, okay, I'm trying to, it's a bit harder for me to do than I thought.)*

* ""I'd grab you and push you into the wall, kiss you hard, make you feel my cock. I'd pull your cloths off and touch every inch of your skin, then thrust my big fat cock inside you making you cum instantly....""

* ""mmmmm yeah, sit on my face, rub that dirty snatch all over me, yeah girl, I cream your back so hard...""

*EVEN* something like this would be made far better if at the end it said something like, ""That's just a sample of what I can do. I thought you might like it. Message me back if you're interested."" But they don't. All they do is talk at me this erotica."

Similarly, not pursuing the girl, and her consequently not leaving her partner, doesn't lessen the already existing odds of her leaving you.  Not pursuing her, however, gives you no additional information as to whether she'd leave you or not.

The expected odds of whether or not this girl would leave you are the same if you pursue her now as they are if you pursue her once her relationship ends naturally; you're acting from a position of no additional information either way.

If you pursue her, and it turns out that she's more likely to leave you (she accepts), then she still would have been more likely to leave you if you hadn't pursued her, you just wouldn't have known about it.

If you pursue her, and it turns out that she's likely to leave you (she declines), then great, you now know that she's less likely to leave you.  Pursue her again once she's out of the relationship. 

Not pursuing her, however, doesn't change the odds at all, it just gives you a worse perspective from which to estimate those odds."

We never intended to leave but when you grind out countless hours in Clan Wars and you get put up against clans with 90 some people you hope to get a few rewards. We had the same 12-15 players come out night after night. Unbalanced to say the least but we still placed within top 3.

jachryan13,Saints,1390359690.0,"hmm, fair point. (I wasn't able to watch all that many games here in Boston this year, so I'm probably not as up-to-date as many people here). 

While I would definitely argue that Denver's definitely looks better than ours this year, I don't think that the talent level is all that different. Demaryius Thomas might be a little faster than Colston, but it's not like Colston is terribly slow. I think we also tend to use him more in the interior and in routes where he doesn't really have a chance for a lot of run after catch. Julius Thomas and Jimmy Graham, I think Graham might have a slight edge. But is Decker all that better than Kenny Stills/Robert Meachem? I'd probably compare Lance Moore to Welker, and that's the only place where I'd give Denver a sizable edge. 

I'm biased because my pet peeve this year has been the run game, and the performance of the offensive line. Comparing us to Denver --- and I haven't watch a ton of Denver games --- but it seems to me that their offensive line is a LOT better than ours, and they can run the ball when they need to. When you have to respect the run, you commit more to the box, and that opens things up for the passing offense. In a few Saints games this year, I saw play after play where we got no push and there was nowhere for the running backs to go. 1st and 10, 1 yd run. 2nd and 9, 2 yd run. 3rd and 7, hey we like to run screens, defense plays the screen, or loads up in pass coverage. That, and Charles Brown forgot how to play left tackle for a while this year. I don't know if Armstead is the answer, either, but he at least didn't totally suck. 

Unless we magically find a Randy Moss in-his-prime type talent somewhere, I don't know how much better the passing offense can really be until we fix the offensive line and the run game."

Of course, this is different for everyone, but I think in a lot of ways strangers are a more forgiving audience - they don't know who you are and they probably don't care. You'll never run into them again, so even if they hate you it will never matter. 

Friends and family can sometimes be great audiences, but they can sometimes be terrible. I think this is especially true for people without a background in performance - they may think they're helpful by providing ""constructive criticism"", but sometimes that ends up causing more problems. If you have great friends who can provide an impartial ear and be supportive, then by all means - but if you have friends like some of mine... yeah, I'd rather perform for thousands of strangers any day. xD"

&gt;Some thing just simply can't be effectively quantified, like aesthetics or feelings. 

You know what I can quantify? How much debt my kids will have to go into to pay for their own education. If I'd majored in something with no demand, I'd be lucky to scrape by with a median income. The way things are now my kids won't have to pay a fucking cent for their education. I can quantify how many vacations I'll be able to comfortably take in my lifetime. I can quantify how early and how comfortably I'll retire. I can quantify how much more quickly I can pay off my student loans.

&gt;It's not very nebulous at all. You have to cite sources EXHAUSTIVELY, make the arguments and counter for everything.

Or you can blow smoke up the professors' asses and fudge citations. Nobody really grades that rigorously, not with class sizes being what they are. That's why STEM is so much harder, statistically you can't half ass a multiple choice test and expect a decent grade, but you can shit out a paper on Melville based on other peoples' analysis and get at least a B. 

&gt;Seriously, the joblessness rate for English Majors is about 4.7%. Aerospace engineering (Literally rocket science) is at about 6.7%. 

Citation fucking needed. http://www9.georgetown.edu/grad/gppi/hpi/cew/pdfs/unemployment.final.update1.pdf puts lit majors at just under 10% for fresh grads and engineers a couple points less. Dig a little deeper and you'll see how few of those liberal arts majors actually have a job that requires the degree they have.  http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/uploads/Underemployed%20Report%202.pdf

shytemptation,birthcontrol,1390359864.0,"I have had my Mirena for about a month and a half now and haven't experienced anything like this. I did bleed for about 2.5 weeks starting a week before I expected my period. The cramping I had was very mild, during insertion there was one sharp pain on my right side (closest approximation I can think of is if that part of my uterus stepped on a Lego during the insertion process - sharp and jarring pain, but faded quickly) and I had occasional mild cramps in the week or two after insertion on that side, but generally the cramps were so mild that I wasn't sure if they were legitimate cramps or if I was just feeling hunger pains or uncomfortable gas. Hunger was ruled out because I ate pretty regularly and when no actual gas came from the gassy feeling I ended up deciding that it must be cramping from the IUD. Every once in a while I'd feel a definite tenderness on the right side where I think I got jabbed during the insertion, but that never got above what I'd say was a 3 on a 0-10 pain scale. The gassy/hunger type cramps were a 1.5 at worst.

At this point I haven't felt cramps in a few weeks and I pretty much completely forget the IUD is in except for when I see posts from this subreddit or get frisky with my boyfriend. I don't feel any weird lump or any pain at all when I check nor have I felt any pain during sexual activities. I have to hunt for the strings a bit since they aren't very long, they seemed to extend down about an inch when first inserted and now that they are curled up I have to run my finger in a circle around my cervix to find where they are nestled in.

I would honestly say your best resource is probably to call and talk to a nurse at your doctor's office. They should have a better grasp of what types of complaints are typical versus ones that are rare or troublesome since they would deal more with IUDs than any of us individually have and they'd probably have the best idea of whether or not you need to actually come in and see a doctor. It's a good intermediate option for when you think you might need to see a doctor but aren't completely certain and a lot of people seem to forget that they can get a telephone consultation for questions like this."

Here's what you don't do.  Corner her in the hall, and say ""WILLYOUGOOUTWITHME.""  Seriously, I did this in school, and it was bad.  Don't be teenage me.

You don't want to put her on the spot, corner her, or otherwise make her feel uncomfortable.

Here's what you do.  Run into her in the hall sometime and strike up a conversation while walking with her.

""Hey, how's it going?  What did you get into last weekend?  Yeah?  That sounds cool/not cool/fun/monotonous/exciting/adjective-y.  You have plans Friday?  Oh, you're going to a thing?  That sounds cool/not cool/something.  Well hey, I'll catch you later, okay?""

Did you see what happened there?  You had a total casual normal conversation with her.  Expressed interest in her.  You inquired as to her availability at a particular time.  She was busy, and you didn't take it as a personal affront.  She didn't reject you, she's just got her own life, you know?  That happens sometimes.

So you try again later.  The next week maybe.  ""Hey, how's it going?  Yeah?  How was that thing you said you were doing Friday that I totally remember?  Awesome.  You have plans on Saturday?  No?  Well, I was trying to go see that Will Arnett movie with the squirrel that all the kids are raving about.  You want to come?""

tubbadog,AskReddit,1390360143.0,"From a comment I made last year:

I was installing a water softening system in a newly built, high end home. Seriously high end. No one had moved in yet, so I had the place to myself.
First order of business is to drain the water from the pipes. Easy job, just turn water main off, open faucets, shower valves (to relieve the vacuum) Then open the lowest drain in the basement.
Everything then goes great. Get softener up and running. Check water clarity: Excellent.
Run upstairs and close all of the faucets I have opened. Cruise back to the cellar and turn the main on to the house. Start picking up tools.
Cut to about 15 minutes later. As I'm gathering some stuff in the basement I can hear water dripping. There's no water in sight. Hmmmm.
Heart starts beating fast.
RUN upstairs. RUN all around house. Get to the kitchen.
It's huge. Granite and Maple everywhere. Like the kitchens in magazines.
Glistening. Wet. The whole kitchen. Water pouring down through the edges of the ceiling lights.
NO.NO.NO.NO.NO. OHGODOHGODOHGOD.
BOOK IT upstairs. To the room above the kitchen. There is a corner shower I had forgot to turn off. WITH NO SHOWER CURTAIN. It had been showering the bathroom floor for about 20 MINUTES!!
Proceed to turn off shower valve and see if I can dry this mess up. (I was in complete denial)
Spend the next four hours sopping up water while more slowly falls. Around five p.m. come to the realization that I need to make two dreaded calls. The homeowner and my insurance company.
Luckily the homeowner was very understanding and I've always paid my insurance bill.
After THREE weeks the kitchen is back to looking fabulous.
For a new ceiling (complete with crown molding!), paint and new cabinets : $25,000 USD
This happened about ten years ago and I'm so OCD about a repeat of that day I triple check every faucet before I turn the water back on after an install. Then check again."

[IPA Source](http://www.ipasource.com/) is another site that provides IPA for many, many songs and arias. You do have to pay to access some of the content, but it is worth it if you're planning to study a piece seriously - it provides excellent IPA as well as translation material, which is really helpful. 

It's not an online resource, but I'd strongly recommend [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Diction-Singers-Italian-German/dp/0195325591) when it comes to diction in Italian, French, and German - it's a great resource and takes a lot of care to talk about diction in a way that acknowledges some of the realities of singing (such as vowel modification and clarification of certain consonants).

lendrick,BasicIncome,1390360211.0,"&gt; Marginal utility is mostly unrelated to absolute utility, this is actually the essence of marginalism. 

You're using a lot of really fancy language to say that people are likely to buy 12 cars if they had the money to do so.

No they aren't.  If anything, that's a perfect illustration on why there are physical limits to how much we can consume.  Where can anyone *put* 12 cars?  Sure, there are a few eccentric people out there who might expend the time, energy, and money to make a space to store 12 cars, but for most of us, it would be absolutely ludicrous.

The amount of luxuries we can own is limited by the time we have to spend with them and the space we have to put them in.  TVs are getting bigger right now, but how long will that last?  I bet the upper limit will be when they no longer fit through a standard door.  But they'll add resolution, right?  There's an upper limit to useful resolution as well.  We're not there yet, but once again, there's a point where it becomes silly to pack more pixels in.  After that, why upgrade your TV anymore?  Heck, 3D was supposed to be this great thing, and for the most part it works as advertised, but people just aren't all that interested in it.

&gt; &gt; but assuming that demand will automatically grow to meet supply forever is like assuming that Moore's Law will last forever.

&gt; No one makes such an assumption, the axiom you are misquoting is that supply &amp; demand will meet and where they meet resolves price.

I'm not trying to quote anything.

&gt; Perhaps you mean that demand will continue to increase infinitely in which case it absolutely will

Wat. 

Okay, so let me get this straight.  I said that demand will not continue to increase just because supply is increasing.  You said that no one would make that assumption.  Then you made that exact assumption and said that demand would continue to increase indefinitely.

&gt; is there something you know about humans that is going to change in the near future to temper their desire to consume? 

Why would it need to change?  What I'm saying is that desire is *finite* (your claim that it's infinite is extremely naive), and once automation is able to keep up with humanity's desire to consume, jobs aren't going to keep popping up out of nowhere.  This is exactly what I'm talking about with Moore's Law.  Demand *cannot* continue to scale out into infinity.  Sooner or later, we'll run out of places to put all of our stuff, and run out of time to use it, even if automation is making it so cheap that we can afford it all.

And even if they did, with advancements in robotics, it's not hard to imagine a future where getting a general purpose robot to do a job will just be cheaper than paying a human to do it.  Humans take a certain amount of resources per year to keep alive.  If someone can build a robot that can do most things humans can do but cost less per year than a human, then even if demand for luxuries continues to magically scale into infinity (it won't), people will *still* lose their jobs."

How enduring is their love for someone with Tully blood? And if both are loyal to Sansa, what would they make of her union with Aegon? Would that affect their willingness to take up arms?

MechMeister,MechanicAdvice,1390360321.0,"Before dropping money on a new sensor, check the air filter to see if it's dirty.

Take a cotton swab and clean behind the throttle butterfly. If it's dirty clean it with Intake Cleaner and clean the MAF with MAF cleaner.

Also remove the Idle Air Control valve and clean that up.

You either trust him or you don't. And if you don't trust someone, usually the relationship isn't going to work out. 

Have you tried *asking* him if he is bisexual or gay or have you only asked him if he made out with his friend?

And is it the idea that he possibly cheated on you what is really bothering you or is the idea that he might be bisexual or gay what is bothering you?

Basically, what I am saying here is that you need to figure out a couple of things. First, is that you need to figure out what about all this is actually bothering you. Second, you need to figure out if you trust your boyfriend or not. "

Are there specific things you find problematic about him or your relationship together that you think wouldn't exist in a different relationship, or is it more of a general curiosity?

The latter is very common, and even a little bit of the former. Especially if you're inexperienced, it's pretty natural to wonder about other possibilities. And being attracted to other people is pretty natural no matter how many relationships you've been in -- for the most part, and obviously discounting cheaters and non-monogamists, people pretty much just learn to deal with it."

D is for Diameter: The spot is larger than 6 millimeters across (about ¼ inch – the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can sometimes be smaller than this.

papermageling,MakeupAddiction,1390360422.0,"You look very pale and also maybe neutral toned. I also am so pale that I find it hard to get foundation matches, which confuses me, because I certainly know paler people. 

Test foundation at your jawline (not terribly far from your ear), to see if it blends in properly. 

If you want to stick to standard foundations, you'll need to go high end. Tarte, Nars, Shiseido, and CoverFX all come to mind as having a good selection of pale shades. Otherwise, you can look at Graftobian (you can get samples from Camera Ready Cosmetics). Bombshell and the colors near it might be good to try? Also, Meow Cosmetics has a mineral foundation that *definitely* has your shade. 

Once you have a good foundation, realize that it'll make you look very different, because you're accustomed to having more color. So be sure to use blush, and adding a bit of bronzer (NYC Sunny) as contour helps, because then you avoid having large expanses of super light skin when you have no such thing without makeup. I always have to contour my nose a bit, because taking the redness away makes it stand out tremendously, and makes me look a bit too different from usual. "

girlscout-cookies,writing,1390360761.0,"Actually, I think the commas are rather effective here.

First, they're grammatically correct - he's using them to offset descriptive clauses, and you'd still have a proper sentence if you took them out. 

Second, each offset clause has pertinent information; they're not just there for the sake of being there. 

""Beyond the last bus"" suggests the true time of Kenny's return home, late enough that the bus has stopped, and ""until he'd had to bum a ride or pay for a cab"" *also* suggests that this is a sufficiently recurring problem that he has gotten home multiple ways. She's not angry because he was out late once, but because he was late many times. Then, the part about her faking sleep. How does Kenny know she was faking sleep? ""Because she never slept that quiet."" 

And then, this ends with that last line: ""those mornings, she'd only put her own cup of coffee in the microwave."" The ""those mornings"" is a repeat that maybe you could leave out, but in a sentence that long, it's a good reminder, and adds a specific cadence: *those mornings*, which hold a special significance for Kenny. 

I mean, think about all that this sentence *says* and *shows.* Monica hears Kenny come home and stays still, not wanting to speak to him; then in the morning, she gets up and exacts this quiet betrayal by not warming up his coffee. She says nothing in this passage but her disapproval is palpable: all this anger and hurt at this husband who stays out late and stumbles home, rather than be with her.

But you could have conveyed that like this: ""The mornings that Kenny stayed out late enough that he missed the last bus, he found Monica faking sleep; she was faking because she never slept that quiet. Those mornings, she'd only warm up her own cup of coffee. Never his.""

This doesn't have as many commas, but god, it doesn't have the same rhythm, the same flow. Read the sentence aloud. Each clause helps create this crescendo: the indignities of Kenny's behavior piling up and then ending with Monica's silent but hurtful revenge. You can hear it in the very flow of the words. That's what the commas are there for.

Exis007,raisedbynarcissists,1390360858.0,"&gt;No. Such. Thing.

&gt;Seriously. Gaslighting is not something you accidentally do. It CAN be habitual, but it's NEVER mild.

I have a follow-up question that I mean as a legitimate question. Maybe my understanding of gas-lighting is wrong or incomplete, but to my understanding small moments that resemble it are a totally normal thing in human beings. Or, alternately, common instances of human behavior might be interpreted as full-on gas-lighting by someone who has had long exposure to that kind of abuse. 

Let me give you a for instance. 

My SO and I are having an argument because he said something mean to me in the morning before we both left for work. He remembers saying 90% of the conversation but the really hurtful comment (let's say he called me lazy) he doesn't remember. He said he doesn't remember and I believe that he doesn't. He thinks I'm crazy for being upset (because he doesn't remember the offending comment) and I think he's minimizing the argument and being a jerk not to take credit for the hurtful thing he said. It is only after repeating many times that he called me lazy that we reach a point wherein we understand the other person's frustration. He was sleepy and clearly didn't remember saying it and his confusion is justified, I'm duly pissed because he did say it. We hug it out and all is well. 

I realize gas-lighting HAS to be intentional. It has to be. You have to mean to fuck with someone's sense of reality for the situation to qualify. But doesn't gas-lighting work BECAUSE situations like this really do happen in real life? Memories aren't perfect and sometimes you remember a situation differently than someone else and the abuser preys on that human moment make you feel nuts. Then, over time, you just integrate a lack of self-belief in your own sense of the situation. Alternately, however, couldn't those real human non-malicious events come off to someone who was routinely gas-lit as the malicious practice and not the benign form we all experience time and again?

I'm not trying to suggest OP's situation is one way or the other, I trust her judgment. I just think what you said about it never being a real accident discounts a certain amount of REAL instances of memory gaps that happen as part of the normal course of being a couple. 

Or am I getting it all wrong? "

keakealani,singing,1390360967.0,"To get a little more technical, one of the best ways to add emotion or character to the voice (both in speaking and singing) is specific decisions of articulation. Emotion can be conveyed well by emphasizing certain words and de-emphasizing others, normally emphasizing the words with the greatest emotion content. 

In singing, emphasis is a bit more difficult because you're held to stiffer standards of dynamic and rhythm. While in normal prose you could simply spend more time on an important word, or say it more loudly, the music may or may not allow for those strategies. (However, if the music *does* allow for either greater dynamic or temporal emphasis, then by all means go for it). 

But, the one strategy you can almost always use is to enunciate the important words the most clearly. That isn't to say that unimportant words should be mumbled, but you should take extra care to articulate important parts of the text. This can mean spending extra time on some of the consonants (especially useful for voiced consonants) or broadening the vowels so they are more distinct. Obviously you don't want to caricature the word too much, but a subtle emphasis on articulation can make a big difference in making the word meaningful. "

My mom would just print out newspaper articles or other stuff from online, order books about sex and puberty, and just leave them on the bed. Never spoke a word about it. Not just about sex (Teenage Sex - It's OK to Say ""NO!"", and many others), but about drinking and drugs too (drunk driving accidents, peer pressure blablabla).

Luckily for me we lived in a place with great sex education and a very open and honest culture about sex and drinking, otherwise chances are I would have been very messed up. "

I mean, I'm a chef, so I may be biased, but I've always loved food.

That being said, I haven't seen Devil's Due yet.  But I have seen Rosemary's baby, several times.  I'd wager a guess that the films are less about pregnancy and such being negative things than playing on the idea of [body horror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_horror) mixed with vaguely religious themes.    

I'm not sure exactly what to make of the fact that both these films were written and directed by men, though - perhaps the idea of pregnancy is legitimately alien and frightening enough to those writes and directors that it became the driving force behind making the films?  

Bitch Media begins the process of exploring the idea of [Mystical Pregnancy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rhH_QGXtgQ&amp;list=PLBBDFEC9F5893C4AF&amp;feature=c4-overview-vl), which may also tie into the idea of pregnant women being frightening, or having pregnancy used against a character.  Since these examples you've given aren't serial shows, however, and the central theme seems to be 'scary demon babies,' I'd guess that it's less an example of how being pregnant is a terrible state for women, and a bit more of 'oh dear me, pregnancy is vaguely frightening, we have no idea what is inside you/me.'"

As for the formula, it's pretty creamy, but it sets well enough for my purposes. It's not a long-wear concealer, so it creases a bit under my eyes (I'm very oily, so this is a contributing factor). I find that patting it back into place with my finger works well. It doesn't move on my brows. I would say they were going for a Clinique Airbrush Concealer dupe with this product, considering the packaging and the ""illuminating"" function."

What makes you say this? The yellow appears to have a line above which it is yellow, below which is normal, and the nail is yellow above the place where it separates from the nailed; it appears to be the nail, and NOT the nailbes which is yellow. After checking your sclera (whites of your eyes) for jaundice, my first thought would be to ask if you wore fingernail polish for a long time and recently stopped using it. I have seen yellowing of nails under fingernail polish of any color worn for a long period. My next question would be if you were taking any vitamin supplements that you stopped taking (or a multivitamin which changed its formulation.)"

codayus,AskMen,1390361759.0,"Well, the Reddit demographic tends to skew towards engineering students, programmers, and generally technical people.  We're comfortable with flowcharts and falsifiable hypothesis; less so with ""follow your heart"".

&gt; It doesn't sound organic and reflective of the spontaneity/weirdness/uncertainty/emotionality of real life.

I can't think of a way to interpret this criticism in a way that is both 1) true and 2) meaningful.  Let's go to your examples:

&gt; Example 1: Hugely popular advice is to discuss sexual kinks with your partner clearly and explicitly before having sex. 

That's because it's good advice.  No, it doesn't always work.  Yes, you can tell a compelling anecdote of it not working.  I can counter with a compelling anecdote of it working great, and someone else can chime in with a horror story of when they didn't try it and really wished they had.  From which we can conclude nothing, because the plural of anecdote is not ""data"".

&gt; She said that any normal person should be able to use common sense and infer what your sexual partner likes by trial-and-error

Your FWB is simply wrong.  And note like, ""kinda arguably wrong"", but ""hilariously, massively wrong"".

&gt; After talking with several other girls, I see that this is a widespread opinion.

That's not how stats work, FYI.

&gt; Example 2: According to a lot of highly upvoted posts, the way to get a date with a girl you like is to ""just ask her already!""

Yep.  Because it's true.

&gt; If you're known as the guy who asks out every girl in your class

Don't do that.  If you're literally attracted to every single girl in your class, your dating criteria are apparently ""two x chromosomes and a pulse"", and that makes you creepy as fuck.  Conversely, if you hit on girls you aren't attracted to, then again, that's weird and creepy.  Don't do it.

&gt; you'll more often than not be seen as a big creep.

Duh.  Also, while it may be good advice to take the subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan, it doesn't really work to take it from Brooklyn to San Francisco.  Why, I couldn't even find the right platform!  By extension, every time anyone suggests taking the subway they're clearly wrong.

See the logical flaw?

&gt; I feel like if you're going to be asking several girls, make sure you know the social ramifications of doing so. But apparently people on Reddit seem to think that asking girls on dates is like a chemistry experiment, where you have unlimited resources and you just try different permutations hundreds of times until you get the right one.

You say these sentences as if they contradicted in some way.  They don't.  You can't mix chemicals in a test tube without some idea of whether they'll explode or release poisonous fumes.  On the other hand, if you don't start mixing some chemicals, then your lab experiment isn't going to get done.  Also this is a really terrible metaphor.

The advice you're attempting to critique is aimed at the people who have never asked anyone out, who are crippled by a fear of rejection, who asked out two girls, got shot down, and are now posting about how they will die alone.  And the proper advice to them is ""jesus christ, ask out some more girls you idiot"".  And your counter is ""well, what if you ask out every single girl in your class and get labelled a creep, or hit on all the girls at your job and screw up your workplace dyanamics"".  To which the proper advice is ""jesus christ, settle down, stop asking out so many girls, and give it some more thought"".

You're taking specific advice, given to people in specific situations, trying to apply it universally, noting that it fails, and then trying to claim everyone else is treating this like a overly simplified flowchart?  Projecting much?

TL;DR:  The short version of your post is ""I talked to a FWB about my fetishes, but she was vanilla and got weirded out.  Also, you can take the advice given to forever aloners about asking out more girls *too* far!""  To which my reply is ""no shit"".  If you think there's any deeper meaning in your observations, however, you are sorely mistaken."

I disagree. I think it's more than the celebrity but it's a degree of comfort with the cameras for one. I think it's greatly important that the people on the show seem alive and fun. that on top of the well lit, nicely shot show is what makes it's popularity. I've seen a number of playthrus and first off a lot of them are too long to be popular outside our community. They need editing  in a way that doesn't feel like editing and Tabletop does this well with it's happy-go-lucky style and simple yet helpful overlays.

The lighting really really helps again. I repeat this because it's important. Of all the regular shows I've seen only WatchItPlayed and Starlit have a consistent lighting that looks attractive.

Finally there's personality. I've seen many videos with some good guys, like skilled and brilliant guys. But they don't present well on camera. It's like watching people act who don't yet understand how important it is to project to the audience."

Introducing first off, me! The Master of Deduction ^^^^and ^^^^seduction is here. *[Tot tot!](https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSOzX2iA5BGwK0qWD2CoNaMLBG2MovHBbRG031rbc8mg_cj4Jb9)*

If I take the first letter of each of your sentences...That spells ""Iiisat"". 

Translating to, ""I sat"". The other i's are there to throw off the curious. See, your subconscious knows what we do not. Do not fear, though. We'll be changing that soon enough. ~_\^

So we'll begin by looking somewhere you've sat since breakfast Friday morning.

Now, what did you have for breakfast? This is of vital importance. If you had, for instance, greasy bacon (And ate it like a real man, no doubt- Yes, I know you're a female. Moving on) and desired to wash your hands after...

that means you moved from you breakfast having location to wash your hands.

Didn't wash your hands, you say? Then breakfast must have been at a diner you were eager to leave.

Hm. Curious. Have you checked your vehicle? Next to the seat you occupied and any others in the car, underneath, and in all the nooks and crannies.

You said it was in your pocket when you came home. Yet, you've not said that you had it when you were *in* your home. This part of the investigation heavily hinges on this fact!

In the instance that you *did* have your card in your home, where were you last? I'm presuming you walked into a communal area- A kitchen, or living room. I hereby deduce this was after your work day, and you were getting ready for having the evening in. **OR** you decided to change for a night out on the town. (Who wears dressed-in-all-day-outfits to go par*tay*, eh? Nobody, thats who.) Either way, you changed at some point in the evening post-work.

We're going on the assumption that you've checked your vehicle, the last known location of your debit card. We're also now assuming you changed clothing after arriving home at some point.

Do you empty your pockets in preparation to change, or do you take your things off *and then relinquish the contents within*?

This is important as our next clue.

A: You emptied your pockets and put things in a precise location where you undressed. The likelihood of your card finding its way *out* of that location is high, check around where you undressed. 

B: You undressed, and then took things out of your pockets. But surprise! Your debit card is missing. Do you happen to have a pet? A wiley cat, or a curious pup for instance? Perhaps even a beaver, rabbit, or any little creature that would pick up a stray bit of plastic in hopes of it being a fun, entertaining new toy?

Check their hiding locations, if so. Y'know. The places pets store their precious treasures (Do be careful not to disturb their other things, if you cannot find your card in those locations! They'll be upset if you do~).

At this point,  we should've found your debit card.

If not, well, you're shit out of luck and may the Sock-Gremlins of yore' have mercy on your pitiful soul. =&lt;

Guys love to give each other tips on how to woo women but I think the most helpful thing for guys would be if they learned more about how women communicate. We are oblique creatures. We expect guys to pick up our hints and guys usually miss them. We might be bored as hell with the conversation but we'll still smile and nod. Not many women are assertive enough to tell you that they're bored. No guy wants to hear this advice, but I think asking your female friends about their experiences with dates is probably as helpful if not more helpful than getting tips from guys.

LtDenali,BDSMcommunity,1390362224.0,"So, recently my girlfriend (and bottom) admitted to me that I wasn't being rough enough, and so I started to think about how I could be more rough with her. Many things came to mind, and I was excited to try them out.

The scene in question was her tied in a rope chest harness, a ball gag, and her hands tied behind her head^1 , then lying down on the floor^1 . I was frustrated at this point because she was being a little brat and only slapping her was getting her to listen. So I figured I'd immobilize her by tying her leg to my metal loft^2 .

1: The hands were actually tied *behind her head*, so her head weight was pressing on them. The ropes were too tight, so they started to feel cold and she couldn't get comfortable. Raising the hands above the head solved this issue...mostly. Still dangerous and I should have known better. 

2: Unrealized by me, I was sitting on her other leg. When I put tension on the rope, it spread her legs too far. I was focused on how far they were being spread, but I didn't realize I was preventing her other leg from compensating. The first thing I heard of protest or pain was her yelling ""OW, FUCK, STOP"" through the ball gag. The scene basically stopped right there.

How could I have helped? Well, being more conscious of rope. I've used rope on her for almost 2 years, and yet this still happened.

How could she have helped? Being more open with communication. We had already established safe words, and they should have been used.

Everyone is fine (both emotionally and physically), but it still happened, so I'll learn from it"

""Would you ever meet someone from OkCupid?""

* Totally Willing
* Hesitant, but I'll give it a shot
* Nope!

so many people are NOT willing to actually meet. /r/okcupid covers it pretty well: get a date within 3 messages. It's not to ""pick someone up"", it's to meet and push things along. You don't want to get to know someone purely digitally. Maybe they chew their food in a really annoying manner. Maybe you don't want to waste time getting catfished. But it all boils down to: meet the person. And if the guy got 88 dates, he's doing 88 better than a _lot_ of OkCupid users, unfortunately."

maowsers93,texas,1390362542.0,"This is really obnoxious. She isn't the ""lesser of two evils"" The author of the DMN intentionally cherry picked facts to question her ability to be a mother and a wife. 

Davis graduated Harvard in the early 90's and their divorce wasn't until 2005. She worked as a lawyer in those years and her income contributed to her family. 

When she went to Harvard her children lived with her in Mass for a year and then went back to live with their dad for the remainder of the time she was there, which was about a year. This isn't child abandonment, this is called sharing parental responsibility. 

Furthermore, Jeff Davis, her husband, was the one that filed for divorce. Wendy didn't leave him, he divorced her. To make matters more interesting when considering the article her oldest daughter was in college and the only child he got custody of was a 17 year old who wanted to stay in the house she grew up in. Davis conceded custody and  paid over $1,000/month in child support in stead of dragging her family through a custody battle. 

Beyond that Davis absolutely grew up poor and had to start working in high school to help pay the bills. She was a single mother when she was 19 but her divorce wasn't finalized until she was 21. 

There is no story here. She was a single mother who grew up poor, remarried, went to Harvard, got divorced, and became a state Senator. There is no controversy. She didn't lie about her marriage. A quick google search with the date set to before this article's publication brings up dozens of articles about it, including articles that her ex was interviewed in.

First you have to put on the episode to set the mood for the task your about to undertake.

Then you want to mix all of your ground beef together and season to your likening. I simply used garlic powder, salt and pepper.

Next we cooked 1 burger to a rare inside, threw cheese on top, and sandwiched it with a bun. 

We then used the first prepared burger and wrapped in in raw meat. Cooking it as you would a meatloaf, we put it into the oven at 350^^o for about 15-20 minutes. Watch out as the pan you put the meat in will fill with oil using caution to properly handle it.

While the middle part is cooking you throw two more patties on the grill, and grill up two normal sized burgers, again cooking it until it's rare. You then take these burgers and deep fry 'em, completing the cooking process. 

You apply cheese to the large burger, and the two deep fried burgers. Add your own Himalayan ketchup to the big one. Put the two deep fried cheeseburgers in buns and use the two burgers as a bun for the big one. 

We also took ours Idaho style so we applied a handful or two of lays chips.

mundabit,Endo,1390362579.0,"I also had to leave work (and school) because of pain. Because my Doctors (bar one, who is taking me seriously) all think its just IBS, I was encouraged to exercise, but like you, even walking short distances is difficult. Its so painful I often black out or I just hit a wall and my muscles wont let me move them because they know the pain is coming. It comes with weakness and malaise that makes it hard to move the next day.

Needless to say my doctors are dissapointed, walking is the one exercise they want me doing and I understand that, But untill I can get some releif its not an option.

Instead I use yoga and pilates to keep myself active, My myotherapist has been working with me for years to try and help me overcome pain, she has taught me several poses that don't aggravate the pain, and some that help stretch the facia and reduce pain later in the week. I wouldn't recomend just any old yoga class, if you can find one designed for older people or people with disabilities that is going to be your best bet. Physiotherapists can also teach you exercises that can help or wont harm.

Exercise wont make the endo worse, But the endo can make the exercise worse. If you are contorted or not moving correctly because of pain, you could end up doing damage to yourself, especially if you are doing something high impact.

water aerobics, home-style callisthenics, yoga and physical therapy are my go-to exercises. There is also a TV show I get in my country called ""Move it or Lose it"" its produced by the local arthritis association, and It has shown me some good ways to get up off my bum but not hurt myself. It can be a little embarrassing to realise that I am following exercise plans meant for 65+, But if it keeps me fit and keeps me in as little extra pain as possible, its a win."

Something is telling me you don't know the difference between a stun and a slow.

Let me help you out. Hexplosive Minefield slows, which is *not* a stun.

Its apples to oranges. The damage and arming time are fine. The only time it will hit someone more than a peck or two is A: When chasing and you're fast enough to be within a good range of them (Rare with Ion/Sorc boots and his base movespeed), B: In a full teamfight situation where avoiding clumping is the counterplay, and C: When you put it behind them right as they start moving backwards and away, which again, being out of range to do that *is* counterplay.

Flamechompers needed the additional arming time since its a hard root, and when they're already slowed by Zap (1500 range) its easy to drop down in front of someone.

Ziggs has plenty of inherent counterplay built in, so I'm going to bunny hop this top set of comments to expand on it quite blatantly.

&gt;**Have boots early, and fucking dodge his shit. Be aware of cooldowns, and don't let his shit hit you.**

balathustrius,mead,1390362832.0,"My opinion is that orange blossom honey makes a solid, classic low-medium sweet (1.010-1.015) mead.

I'd keep the recipe simple (honey, water, nutrients, yeast), let it ferment dry, then backsweeten. I like fairly tame mead, compared to some folks, so I would aim for 12% ABV. It's also a good level to shoot for when it comes to weddings, since folks like to ask you 6-8 months before the event. That's enough time to have something drinkable if you stagger the nutrients and aerate 2-3 times a day up until 1/3 sugar depletion.

I'd choose between K1V-1116 and D-47. 1116 is a very clean fermenter without being a monster like 1118. D-47 can really bring out the character of orange blossom honey.

**For 5 Gallons:**

13 lbs honey

Water to 5 gallons

Nutrients†

2 packets Lalvin K1-V1116 *or* D-47, rehydrated in Go-Ferm

† How you get your required nutrients is up to you. Everyone seems to have their own idea about it. My explanation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pW-dC91OupCYKX-zld73ckg9ximXwxbmpLFOqv6JEk/edit?usp=drive_web).

After fermentation is completely finished (gravity &lt; 1.000), stabilize and backsweeten with 2-3 lbs of the same honey. Two pounds should bring you up to 1.012. Three pounds should be around 1.018.

Please don't do what /u/schwiz suggested.

Of course, if you have a keezer, you can make your life simpler by stopping fermentation via a week in the ol' chiller when you reach the desired sweetness."

I've played him for ages, and now thats he's gotten some QoL changes and a buff he's instantly flavor of the month enough to warrant threads about his strength.

Basically, if you're losing to Ziggs, you picked the wrong champion or fucked up somewhere. Same goes with any champion. Don't forget about player skill level, too. I've shit on people with Ziggs for as long as I can remember, and the last thing I want is a bunch of baddies influencing the direction his playstyle and abilities goes toward.

He'll be like any heavy flavor of the month at the moment. Once people learn how to deal with his shit, pick for the situation, and pay attention to his location to avoid CC'd ults on the sidelanes, it'll be fine.

I don't think there's anyone we could draft that would have a prayer of seeing the field at those positions. I think it would literally take Clowney somehow being available at #30 for us to seriously consider a first round DLineman.  Our top needs are pretty clearly WR, CB, and S.

Given the way you have the board falling, I could see us trading our extra 2nd to move up for Evans, or our extra 3rd to move up for Lee.  If we stand pat, given who you have available as options, I'd see us taking Jordan Matthews or perhaps a CB - Jason Verrett or Lemarcus Joyner, most likely."

If you haven't already, you might try a plus-size store that sells a 14w or a 16w. The w means women's size and is more generously cut than a regular 14 or 16. Sears sells the w sizes here in Canada. 

I generally shop at Evans and Yours Clothing, both of which sell UK plus size clothes. Their styles are great for work. Just measure yourself before ordering and order less than $100 at a time, because you can sometimes avoid duty charges. P.S. I usually buy exclusively natural fibre clothes when ordering online. I almost always hate things in non-natural fabrics.

You might know this but some stores sell junior plus which is cut slimmer in the mid-section, bust, and hips. These are usually very trendy stores, like Forever 21. That can be confusing when an 18 suddenly fits more like a 14."

The advice here is teaching how to write for a reader, rather than just putting an idea on paper. Palahniuk isn't saying every sentence you ever write should be in this fashion, it's an exercise designed to help you become a more rounded writer. The ability to learn from others is a highly useful skill, especially in a field like writing.

keakealani,musictheory,1390363454.0,"There are seven diatonic triads in a key, but that hardly means that those are the only available chords. There are extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, etc.), all of which can be modified (certainly a vi7#9 is very different than just a regular vi chord). There are chromatic alterations, many of which are extremely common like secondary dominants, tritone substitution, augmented 6th chords, neapolitan chords, etc. There is mode mixture. There are mediant relationships. And that's only the beginning of (mostly) tonal tertian harmony. There are also a wealth of other harmonies when you begin to include cluster chords, quartal and quintal chords, etc. 

Plus, technically these chords could be used in any order, with any other chords. The fact that certain chord progressions are still reproduced repeatedly is a testament to their commonness in music. 

(Of course, that doesn't mean that common = bad, either - it more means that some things ""work"" and a lot of people take full advantage of that.)"

DrStephenFalken,AdviceAnimals,1390363489.0,"It's well know in the industry that Bourdain exaggerated some parts of his book. Also this part of his book was hyperbole against people who order well done. Much like later in his book when he speaks on vegetarians. His book is a memoir not a de facto way things are ran in the industry. Bourdain also hasn't cooked professionally in nearly 15 years now.  His book was printed in 2000. The food industry much like the tech or medical industry moves fast. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of his work but much of what he said in his book doesn't hold up anymore. It's akin to reading a memoir from civil war era doctor and thinking all the medical knowledge he provides is still valid today.

I've worked in many places in my over a decade as a cook, chef de cuisine (many different titles and many different quality restaurants etc) and I've never seen this shitty cut of steak that is fed to the person who like well done. The rare to medium cuts are thick and weighed out according to the menu. The sirloins come from the same primal and are cut thinner and weigh the same. It doesn't matter how you order a steak a shitty cut of steak is a shitty cut of steak and if a customer has to cut threw a bunch of fat, gristle, and sinew. Guess what? You're going to be cooking them another steak.

I'm certain you can ask an other cook here the same thing and you'll get the same answer from them that I'm providing for you. Just like Bourdains ""no fish on Monday"" Doesn't mean anything anymore. I can get fish any day of the week. I often get it Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for my place. Often on Sunday, I'm actually running out of fish. On Monday if you come in and order fish, you're going to get the fresh stuff that comes in the morning on ice. The fish left over from the weekend (which there hardly ever is any) is going into soup for my family meal or I'll eat it Sunday night for my personal meal if there isn't a lot left. 

Bourdain also spoke of bread going back into rotation if you don't eat it. That's not true at all the health board would shut me down. Bread is so freaking dirt cheap that we don't reuse what's left over from someones table. I'd rather spend the 5 cents a table for bread rather then be known for the restaurant that got everyone sick and shut down. "

It's rare that games have rules that list cheating. But it's quite common for games to be dependent on non-cheating. Heck Go Fish for instance requires people to give a card if it's called for. This is an example of ""don't cheat"" that we see in many games such as forinstance ""Love Letter"" when someone guesses right you have to discard and drop out. ""Settles of Catan"" has a *Monopoly* Development card that requires you to give up all of a single resource but implied is that you don't cheat and keep some. Heck discarding half your hand from the robber is a form of ""Don't Cheat"". 

There are so many games that imply ""Don't Cheat"" it's almost hard to think of a game where you don't see it. Those would be open information game for the most part. Like Chess or Binary Homeworlds"

When we have him alone for the weekend it's a different story, I have more patience, and he's so much better behaved.

I put it on when I want to chill, write, think, or really whenever. I think of everything I've gone through with the story, the life lessons learned, the friends I'd made, the friends I'd lost, the new worlds I'd explored, and the difference I'd made. As each piece plays, I'm transported back to Virmire, Ilos, Tuchanka, quiet moments in the captain's cabin with teammates-become-family. It makes replaying the trilogy difficult, because I *know* what happens... to the Normandy, to Kaidan or Ashley, to Mordin, to Anderson. 

But I play them anyways, because in the end it's still worth going through countless firefights just to hang out with Joker and EDI acting like the galaxy's most immature old couple. Mordin's death was made easier by Garrus' earlier words that ""we're in this together."" The guilt of ordering my squad to leave the battle before we'd reached the Beam was softened by Anderson's last words of ""I'm proud of you. You did good."" Those words weren't just spoken to Shepard - they were said to *us.*

This track encompasses all of it - and though I tend to tear up a little each time I hear it, I'm reminded of the journey I'd spent as Commander Shepard, heading off into the unknown to save the world... again."

My one gripe is that the writing was a little cliche.

^^ your own words.

&gt;No, I'm deconstructing the people who feel they're worth more because they decided to go STEM. 

By pretty much every available metric STEM majors are, on average, worth more. Higher income, less likely to work more than one job, less likely to need to work fuckloads of hours year-round, lower retirement age, less unemployment, better benefits - all of which lead to profound positive impacts on family life. 

&gt;I'm not actually sure it's really possible to argue against you now. Backfire effect set in, I guess. I have ceased to be a person, but rather a collection of prejudices and stereotypes in text form.

That's cute, I can actually hear the cognitive dissonance churning. You started this thread because of a desperate need to feel superior to the STEM crowd. The sentiment bubbles into all of your posts in this thread."

I'm not sure a tailor would be able to correct the sleeves on the shirt you posted.

Look for ""slim"" or ""fitted"" shirts.  You're likely to have the best luck buying shirts based on your neck and sleeve measurements, and not S/M/L/XL sizes.  Working out is a great idea, but I don't think you need to work out to look good with your frame.  Fitted clothes will make you look stronger either way."

You will be very close to the Virginia Holocaust Museum, unlike any other you may have come across. There is a small museum underneath the Capitol Building, VMFA is 100% a must-see, Historical Society, Virginia Science Museum, Poe Museum, Architecture Museum.

On weekdays you can go to the top of city hall there is an observatory.

Life is a fucked up situation because the idea of consciousness in an existence where conscious beings are mortal means there is no way of ""winning"". In fact, people have the capability to imagine so much more than their body could even handle, even if they devoted all of their energy to accomplishing those thoughts.

Life is pointless but to reject life is to reject consciousness. If you reject consciousness then you have lost. You can't win but it doesn't mean you have to lose.

Life isn't a game and even if it was a game of sorts, there isn't always a winning player and a losing player. There are gray areas. Not ties, but not losses. It is a paradox of existence that in order to continue one must forgo the notion of success and simply be."

ecclectic,Welding,1390364348.0,"If I get any of this wrong, I'm sure someone will correct me.  I am trying to keep it as easy to understand as possible, but if things aren't understood please ask for clarification.

1. cold 'ropey' looking bead. Poor penetration, typically some cold lapping. The joint will be sporadic, with areas that have no fusion at all and some that will hold very little stress.

2. Flat, shallow weld, often with undercut, lots of smoke/soot.  Low penetration, likely a brittle joint from too high heat and rapid cooling.

3. More than typical spatter, possible porosity, lots of rippling from puddle disturbance during the weld. With the exception of porosity, the major downside here is cleaning up the spatter.

4. Spatter, porosity, brittle weld, that hard, dry look; and sometimes it's very hard to tell that it's going on.  Basically it's just bad news all around.

5. Bulbous bead profile, possible rolling at the toe of the weld.  Increases the potential for cracking, doesn't look nice.

6. The manipulation thing can cause inclusions, spatter, and weak points in the joint if it falls short of the required weld profile.  Convexity means that the weld isn't actually holding as much as it may appear to.  Fillet welds are measured as a triangle, if the toes are outside the triangle, the weld is only considered as large as the area inside the triangle.

7. Globular transfer has a time and place, it's very spattery, and leaves a less desirable bead profile than spray transfer.  It's got a high deposition rate and can be achieved with CO^2 rather than argon rich mixture gasses though, so it sees usage, and is often assumed to be spray transfer by inexperienced people who aren't using a high argon mix.

8. Spray arc transfer!  Beautiful, hot as hell, very low spatter, good penetration/deposition.  Not suitable for all uses, thin material or for out of position welding"

You're worried because you think you lost power and status in the relationship and now you feel vulnerable because you're pretty sure you're not #1 out of 51 dudes. But nothing changed from before and now, *it's all in your head*.

You suddenly see yourself as competing with 50 other shadows from her past. But that's bullshit -- it's not a competition because there are no other competitors. She's exclusive with you.

&gt;Our conversations are flat.

No, *your* side of the conversation is flat. You're withdrawing because you're scared you'll be exposed as inadequate, and you just feel really unspecial. You're just not confident and self-assured enough in your own identity (apart from sex) to believe that you alone are enough to keep someone like her around.

What you're going through is practically a rite of passage for guys in their 20s, the pangs of sexual insecurity as you explore what it really is you have to offer the world and the people you love.

You need to get your head on straight. Your thinking is distorted, and your fears are making your thinking even more irrational. Go see a therapist or write in a journal openly and honestly about your fears. Examine what you think and feel, and see if you really believe those things. If you find that you don't, throw those thoughts away and replace them with others. Anyone who has gone through good cognitive behavioral therapy can attest that this isn't impossible to do."

Third of all, I'm sure you know the differences among fasting policies from rite to rite and even diocese to diocese (favorite example: capybara counts as fish in some dioceses!). Therefore this is a law of custom, not of nature.

Fourth of all, the document you cited above is wrong about Purgatory and the Council of Trent is right."

If something I've said helps you get closer to your goal, then a) you get to live your dream and perhaps a nice girl to go with it, and b) and nice busty girl might get a guy who makes her feel special and not like just a pair of tits.

I apologize about most of my post sounding like I assumed you were disrespectful to these ladies. I meant it in a way more like If you find yourself starting to bumble it up, don't go for a joke that might fail or just come out of your mouth wrong.  No one wants to be a Socially Awkward Penguin. 

Anyway, you said it yourself: 
&gt;the individual in front of you is what matters.

If you make any woman feel like she matters, as long as she's not stone cold, she'll recognize that and come back to you for more. If you find enough common ground, then BAM, relationship.

I think part of the problem is that YOU are the one feeling like you're perving on them. (And I imagine you are, but so what? There's no point in pursuing a woman if there's no sexual attraction there. Perving is somewhat expected.)

What if it's just that the busty woman is your ideal, and that's what you want. There's nothing wrong with that. And no one is saying you can't have a lady like that. That's not out of your league. Make the busty woman in front of you feel like she matters, and she could very well be yours. :) And yes, you might be putting more of yourself on the line, but if you get your ideal, then I would think it would pay off in the end."

fiat_lux_,TheBluePill,1390364773.0,"Just to make it clear, in case it wasn't obvious, I actually agree  with the majority of what you've written in this thread, and the comment you replied to was meant as a caveat/footnote. In this case, in case people misinterpret what you've said and start imagining there being some patriarchal gov't conspiracy against single women there. 

&gt; Yes they are the ones writing them but my understanding is it's sponsored by the state? I'm not trying to condemn the Chinese here by any means- obviously these views differ from my own and I would have zero interest in forgoing rights in order to get married and have kids personally-

The ACWF (the Chinese women's network) are supposed to be an NGO, but we all know that no significant political faction in China is independent of the gov't. A combination of East Asia supercultural stereotypes along with a populist/revolutionary history makes rule of law weak. What they consider NGOs there wouldn't qualify as such here. I'm saying this even with full knowledge that even in the US, we cheat a bit on what we consider NGOs, and the definitions you find for NGOs as well as prominent examples of them on wikipedia change all the time, especially when they have historical ties to FBI/CIA.

However, NGOs in China don't even *pretend* to be free from gov't influence. The ACWF president herself is a member of the NPC (the State) as well as the CPC (the Party) itself. This violates most commonly understood definitions of NGOs, including Wikipedia's ever-changing but most recent one:

&gt;  In the cases in which NGOs are funded totally or partially by governments, the NGO maintains its non-governmental status by excluding government representatives from membership in the organization.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization

So if we're being honest, yes you could say that it is heavily tied to the state as well as the party, but it's the same with all the political factions and large state-owned corporations there. The Party is over 80 million members, over 6% of the population. Anyone who performs well academically and wants any political power or connections at all wants to join the party there. It's their weird version of registering to vote.

The question here I want to pose is whether there is malicious intent against single women or not, at least from the ACWF.

Wikipedia calls it a pejorative term, but it's very easy to spin these things in any manner we like, especially with the language barrier. I personally don't think it's terribly malicious. I've read the articles you're referring to in both English and Chinese before, and just don't see it. I found it significantly less pejorative than say hikkikomori is in Japan, but that is more subjective. Asians can be very blunt with their language though.

I also take this with the context that the ACWF does a lot to help ""sheng nu"" and a lot of its own members are sheng nu.

Chinese public representatives don't have a great history for making articles/speeches for Western audiences though and it'll often sound like they're putting their foot in their mouths, so it's usually easier to see their intent through their actions.

That being said, because of weak rule of law and corruption, it's not like I want to make excuses for the Chinese gov't. If we want to view them in a more sinister light, I can accommodate that, so long as the conspiracy makes sense. I haven't been paying enough attention in the past year or two, but if you have recent examples of this shaming and pressuring people to marry, I'd say that *does* coincide with other plans they have recently made public. E.g. the gradual dissolution of the one-child policy that imply efforts towards demographic control.

&gt;  but I was just saying that the phenomenon of unmarried, relatively affluent Chinese women in their 30s the terper referred to is in fact real.

Yep."

The only ""definable difference"" between these things is you arbitrarily deciding that some thigns are so important they're necessary, and others are not. Which is not a fundamentally different type of thing. Only a level. That, or you're merely making a value judgement that some things are not a big deal at all, which would make them NOT moral issues.
