Drunken_Black_Belt,relationship_advice,1389538657.0,"For the basic advice I'm going to say, if she's down with it, take the leap and move to Germany.  If only to experience more of the world.

As for your parents:  Listen I'm an atheist as well.  My family was never super religious so I didn't have to go through all of that.  My g/f, however, is a born again Christian.  Finding out I was an atheist (she always assumed I was just non practicing catholic), was rough on her.  It took a lot for her to get over her preconcieved notions and prejudices about Atheists.  She knows I'm a good person, so that was hard for her to reconcile.  

And that is partly what is going on with your parents.  The biggest thing my g/f had to reconcile was this simple fact;  According to her beliefs, no matter how good I am, I am going to suffer forever.  No matter how much she loves me, we won't get to spend eternity together.  It was rough.  It really hit her hard.  Eventually though she came to her own decisions on the matter, and now we are happy.  She was never intolerant by any means, but she had a lot of preconcieved notions to combat.  And Im sure its the same way with your parents.  They aren't angry, they are scared.  They truly believe you are damning yourself to eternal suffering. I mean if you believed that and someone you loved was throwing it away, wouldn't you do anything to save them?  I'm not saying their actions are correct or even wholly justified, just that they are doing it out of love, in a sick twisted way.  I know that may not make it any easier, but just know it's not their fault.

Take the trip to Germany.  See the world, and hopefully things with you and your g/f will continue to be great.  Let you parents know your plan, and that you still love them and forgive them.  To paraphrase  some long haired dude in a fairly old, popular book, ""Forgive them, for they know not what they do"".  Let them know you are going out there to live your life, and be a good person in the world.  They can either accept that and reconcile their relationship with you, or they can sit there and be angry and bitter.  Go live your life, and do good.  It'll all work out in the end"

wraith313,AskMen,1389538782.0,"White guy with a black girlfriend here.

I don't think it is inherent. I think that a lot of people have an issue with the way that some black girls act. White girls are usually not as direct etc as black girls. You can expect black girls to tell you like it is about stuff, and a lot of guys can't handle that for some reason.

The way they deal with a lot of issues is also less ""feminine"" than you would expect. Also I think that a lot of the things they do with their hair (not all of them, mind you) is a little ridiculous. In an effort to make their hair look (I guess) ""not black"" (straightening, chemicals etc) then end up ruining the hair that they do have and then have to rely on weaves etc to fix it.

I think that's sad, because their hair looks fine to begin with. It's just unfortunate that they believe that society expects something different from them. It all stems from the days (in the US anyway) when racial tensions were much higher.

As to your point about the attitude. Yeah, they can. Not all black girls are like that. I find that *it completely depends on socioeconomics and upbringing* and it is *not because they are black at all, because all races can and do experience the exact same thing*.

Personally, I am more into black girls than white girls. It is not a ""fetish"" thing. I just like being talked to directly and not having to deal with what I am calling ""white girl problems"" which is a phenomenon where they passively say things and expect you to read their mind. It's refreshing that, when I fuck up with my current gf, she will say ""You fucked up. Heres how x, x, and x."" It's not some big damn puzzle. I love that."

TotallyUnqualified,AskMen,1389539124.0,"I don't think any race is inherently less desirable.

Being a mixed race couple draws extra attention, much of it not positive. I would have no problem dealing with that to be with the person I love, but it's also hard to sign myself up for that before I actually get to know the person and see why its worth it to turn a few heads.

I think dating sites exacerbate this problem. When you are eliminating people by category instead of personality, the black ladies are getting crossed off the list without a fair shot. 

So I really don't think it has anything to do with natural attractiveness, but you're still fighting an uphill battle.

My best ex-relationship contained a girlfriend who wasn't a smoker yet thought my smoking was ""cute"".

Having foreskin over the head of your penis is like having the clitoral hood over your clitoris. There's still plenty of sensation there. The fact that he ""he didn't really feel anything"" is the real problem and that could be a medical issue he needs to see a doctor about or it could be something else as straightforward as he's just not into the sex. Foreskin or no, there should be plenty of feeling. If he has phimosis there will be *too much* sensation. There's something else going on.

How to discuss it? I don't know. It could be so many different reasons and knowing nothing about his personality it would be a complete fluke to give good advice on what to say.

Btw since ""he said it felt uncomfortable but not painful"" I'd guess it's not phimosis, (which is [over-diagnosed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2499015/)) bad news is it's going to be something else."

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1389539779.0,"I'd never played a team sport before I started roller derby, so I can't really compare in that regard. Even at a recreational level of roller derby, there is much more of a focus on practice than there is on playing. Like with recreational softball, you might play once a week and never practice.  In dodgeball, you don't practice. In adult beer league ice hockey, you might play once a week and practice once a week. An average derby team might have two practices a week but only play once a month. This is because roller derby takes a lot to learn. It's more complicated than many other team sports. It also requires a lot of skating skills, many of which require a lot of practice. Someone who is a decent roller skater would still need two or three months to learn the skills and learn the game before they even try playing.

But it's really rewarding. It's full contact, so a lot of people find that enjoyable. Even though it's a team sport, you can still compete with yourself to improve. You can get pretty close to your teammates, and become friends. It's also one of the few amateur sports that people come watch. Nobody comes to watch a softball game except for SO's. But I've played in front of 2000 people before. Derby is a sport where there is room for all body types. I've played with women from under 5' to over 6', from well under 100lbs, to over 250lbs. Size doesn't matter except at perhaps the very highest level.

I would say it does require toughness, however. You can't stop playing in the middle of a jam because someone's hard wheel got you in the shin. You have to get up in less than three seconds if a girl twice your size hits to the hard concrete floor. You have to keep skating even if someone hits you in the chest and knocks the wind out of you.

Derby isn't really cheap, however. Beginner gear might cost $300-$400 for lower quality stuff. (I own $700 custom skates!) You have to pay monthly dues, pay for your own jersey, often pay for a lot of fundraisers, etc.. There is also a time commitment factor. Practices are typically twice a week, but then there are committee meetings, fundraisers, birthdays, etc.

I mentioned that it takes a lot of work before you can even play. That means you can't attend practice a couple of times to try out the sport. You might be able to practice skating, but definitely not playing. I recommend checking out a bout to see if you can imagine yourself doing it. Then talk to some derby girls and get invited to watch a practice. Perhaps you'll really like what you see!

Ask more questions if you've got some!"

Despite having one of the most affluent states, we also have some huge poverty gaps, and not suprisingly, the poorest seem to be minorities.  

Now, i'm a white guy, and I've dated all types of ethnicities.  I personally, LOVE black girls.  I just find them sexy.  However, it is extremely hard to make a connection.  I'm a pretty clean cut guy appearance wise.  Most attempts to talk to a black girl are met with hesitation at best.  It's just a divide that is difficult to overcome sometimes.  It sucks.  Not to say it's impossible, but it can be the biggest obstacle to overcome.

I can relate to the toll that pretending to be someone you're not takes on your psyche.  You can only pull it off for so long before it pulls you apart.  After some reflection on how much better I feel after leaving, I simply can't fathom the possibility that a loving God would want me to have anything but freedom of mind and soul.

Your sexual orientation is part of who you are.  A loving God would never ask you to do anything but embrace and enjoy your sexuality.

Whatever you decide to do with your life, please remember that the Governing Body has made prophesies in the past that have turned out to be wrong, so you don't need to worry about their judgement (Deuteronomy 18:22).  Follow your own conscience.  You'll find the right path."

I also take dearly and belief what James said about the tongue and how we use it is very true:

""When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. 4Or take ships as an example. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. 5Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark. 6The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body. It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of oneâs life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.

7All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures are being tamed and have been tamed by mankind, 8but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison."""

buff_hamster,baseball,1389539973.0,"Definitely agree, here's a few points I would add:

* Ghirardelli sundaes. Yes they're expensive at $9.50 a pop but so worth it. Don't go to the one that's off the right field foul pole; the line there is always atrocious. There's one close to the left field foul pole that no one seems to know about.
* Avoid the Coca Cola slides/big glove area like the PLAGUE unless you have small children and get there with plenty of time to spare before the game.
* The bleachers are in fact a really fun place to sit, especially on Orange Fridays. Yes you will get a bit of ribbing, it's a lively crowd out there, but as long as you're not a Dodgers fan (and maybe the rest of the NL west and Phillies should be thrown in there too) you'll be fine. Feel free to give as good as you get, we (or at least I) love banter.
* If you go to a Giants-Dodgers game, the ""BEAT LA!"" chants will give you chills. Guaranteed.
* You gotta get really into the Journey singalong in the mid-8th. They play ""Lights"" if we're winning and ""Don't Stop Believing"" if it's tied or we're losing. [And you never know when Steve Perry will show up to sing with you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJXdldAtTBY)
* If you're sitting on the club level you have to go through a tunnel-like hallway to get to your seats, if you loiter around there you have a good shot at running into some players as they use that same hallway to go between the dugout and the clubhouse. I met Matt Cain down there once.
* Finally, I would say take the train (Caltrain) to the game if you're coming up from the peninsula. The atmosphere is awesome - the train is packed with orange-and-black-clad Giants fans EVERYWHERE, everyone's having a good time, and it's so much fun. Technically alcohol's not allowed on the train, and there are cops waiting on the platform at 4th &amp; King to snag anyone with an open container. But then once you actually get to 4th &amp; King it's just a 5 minute walk to the ballpark.

It's absurd for someone to be more concerned about staying awake than the serious things said by the girlfriend/wife. The hypothetical thought of such unusual behavior incites laughter, because it's hypothetical and the audience recognizes that nothing bad is actually happening to trigger an empathetic response.

I'll concede that it's not an exactly high-brow or original joke, and just another 2edgy4me joke, but I can recognize the potential ""funny"" of a fart joke even thought they don't do anything whatsoever for me. I'll also concede that there might be people who see the joke and laugh for sinister reasons, so it might be harmful to make these kinds of jokes since it emboldens those kinds of people. And I'll also recognize that for some people it might trigger an empathetic response regardless of it being a hypothetical, maybe because they have a real-life experience with the subject matter and shit gets too real, and you can't reasonably expect them to feel comfortable with that kind of joke. But to say something like ""if you laugh at this then domestic violence is funny to you"" isn't justified, maybe you're following the SRS method of being purposefully reductive and ""being intentionally hypocritical to hold up a mirror to Redditors and make them feel how we feel"", but then how much do you really care about the fallout from these jokes?

The album really shows that he hasn't lost anything over the years and the fucking crazy 3rd verse of rap god is one of my favorite ever. How he rhymes ""tough times"" ""punch lines"" ""unsigned"" ""columbine"" etc for like 20 lines is awesome and then launches into the fast bit that everyone loves and he's still not done.

Circumcision just isn't something I think about much so it's kind of embarrassing that it took so long to even realize why his penis was so different. By the time I realized it wasn't a deformity I wasn't sleeping with him because he was looking for more romance than I was interested in at the time so there was no opportunity to discuss the subject with him.

The wiki page would be a decent start: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_issues_in_China

No shit, I don't do racial essentialism either, but pointing out that someone missed a spot when they're painting in broad strokes isn't particularly helpful. Additionally, I've been to China, interacted heavily with mainland Chinese there and in my home nation, and live in a city-state with an overwhelming Han Chinese majority. I think I'm amply qualified to make the observation that Chinese people can be pretty racist (especially in communities where they're the dominant demographic), though from what I've heard they've got nothing on South Koreans and Japanese."

IntellegentIdiot,AskUK,1389540697.0,"Honestly I'd take her to Elland Road, it's closest and Leeds Utd are analogous to the minor league teams you mentioned. You could take her to a smaller club but it's not likely to be as enjoyable to watch.

I'm not sure what you find intimidating either. The only difference you'll find is the size of the crowd, at least at most clubs.

As for where to sit, etc. that depends on the club but if I were you I'd try to get tickets in the parts of the ground that have the most expensive tickets. If there's a designated family stand it might be a quieter experience but in the eyes of most fans that's the opposite of what's enjoyable. I'd try to find some good local food on a site like urbanspoon or yelp, rather than eat at the ground. The food in the ground will be over priced and akin to burger van food.

Wherever you go, just wrap up warm. Where whatever you like, other than another teams shirt. No one will care what your wearing otherwise.

talk_nerdy_to_me,legaladvice,1389541279.0,"In Colorado you generally cannot get unemployment if you were fired for cause or misconduct. Being perfectly honest, it sounds as though your employer would have enough to support firing you - tardiness, two write ups , and an escape. Additionally it seems as thought your employer feels as though your are incompetent and do not respect orders. As to bringing your complaints to the labor board, I do not think you would have very strong claims, if claims at all. If you are not being paid for the hours you work that is one thing. There is no law requiring employers to give employees more consistent shifts, ect. Additionally, paid time off days I do not believe are legally mandated but rather an employer's policy. Finally, although your co-worker threatened you and that is unfortunate, you would not have any damages because nothing happened. If your co-worker acted on his threat or continued threatening you so that you felt unsafe in the workplace you might have a stronger claim. In an office context one threat from a co-worker might create a ""unsafe work environment"" but because you work in a correction facility you would probably need to prove a lot more to demonstrate that your employer made your working environment unsafe."

miked4o7,Steam,1389541304.0,"&gt; When Android first started it was a marketing term because on pretty much every phone the Google logo was somewhere.

Not at all.

You're really stretching for that one.  It's an OS.  An OS is a lot more than a marketing term no matter how you cut it.

&gt;This isn't a new entry into a small market, its another version of an option that has already existed for decades. It is providing another choice to an ecosystem that is already chalk full of options.

In real life though, I don't judge people's actions, I judge their intent. If they do something that really ends up hurting me but they were trying to help, I am nothing but grateful, and vice versa; if they're trying to hurt me but it ends with me better off, I'm mad at them. It is all about intention with me. It is kind of frustrating. This also happens to an extent if the movie has a happy ending. If nobody died, then all you have is a great story to tell everyone. If everyone died (why found footage films are usually my favorites) then you have an entity that means business and should not be fucked with.

Maybe I am being naive, but I was there for four years and I felt like it almost didn't matter how much money we had.  They could have given the teachers a million a year and we couldn't have worked harder.  

The students come in at 15, barely able to read, not able to sit in a chair for three minutes, 25-50% with IEPs (most of the diagnosis being ""Oppositional Defiant Disorder"") and virtually no parental support.   

We even moved into a brand new state of the art building with top resources, but within a year it was subject to the same vandalism, etc.

I left teaching, it just felt so heart-breaking and futile.  The issue is, I feel, it that we are trying to cure all of the problems of poverty in the classroom.

Usually, I recommend offline instead of online communities. This is technically a community, but without an offline one that provides a consistent practice, it's probably confusing.

If there are really no Buddhist communities, you still have options. When I was still looking for a sangha, I still attended an Episcopalian church near me. I told the Reverend and others that I wasn't a Christian (they asked), but I did want to be involved because I wanted to be apart of their service work. At least it was a way to practice above-and-beyond generosity (a Buddhist virtue). I still go now that I have found a sangha, even. 

If you don't want to pick another religious establishment that is available as an opportunity to practice Buddhist principles, you could always volunteer. That also can provide you with community and a way to be helpful.

Both options don't really help with formal teaching though. I suggest looking up schools, choosing one to study in-depth, and mainly sticking to readings in that practice. You don't have to be married to it; if you have given that path a real chance and you see that it doesn't fit, you can choose another. 

Choosing one at a time makes things less confusing, and therefore less vague. A lot of schools have free ebooks available. The typical Barnes and Noble Buddhist book is notorious for portraying the author's idiosyncratic teachings as if they represent all of Buddhism when they don't. I suggest you take a break from those kinds of books until you can be more discerning about what your inclinations are. "

In theory: you could look at games like Number Munchers, Where in the ____ is Carmen Sandiego\*, Civilization. 

All of those games were educational to various degrees and kids who played them would play them again in a heart beat.... right now even. Like seriously someone get me a number munchers rom.

In Practice: I assume you mean strictly board game and even then it's possible. I didn't refuse to back [Clever](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2092880210/clever-play-what-you-see-learn-what-you-dont) because it looked boring. I refused because the cost benefit ratio put it out of my range. $29 bucks for a card game is too much for me right now. But if it appears in my FLGS I have no problem buying it.

There are trivia games like *Wits and Wagers* or *Timeline/Cardline* that could be argued as educational and they're wonderful fun. Depending on how educational it takes to qualify there's a whole host of games set in real life historical contexts that educate you thru their theme and we love them. Games like *Thurne and Taxis* or even *Carcassone*.

People don't shy away from educational games. People shy away from age inappropriate games. The reason Number Munchers isn't burning up the charts right now isn't because it's edutainment and people don't like it. It's because it's edutainment targeting an elementary school level audience. If Edutainment games targeted an older audience the old audience would respond (along the merits of the game of course).

NeonGreenTV,AskMen,1389542519.0,"I'm male and black, and I want to speak on this.
Let me state first before I get into this, **THIS IS NOT HOW I FEEL** this is what hear from some black men who have become apathetic about black women, and some men of other races who give reasons why they don't date black women.

It seems that a lot of men have a problem with the attitudes that black women carry. A lot of men, black, white, etc... say that they have a problem with the neck swerving and snapping attitude that a lot of black women carry. Some men seem to feel that black women tend to be more overweight than women of other races, thus men who don't want to date heavier women tend to steer clear of black women. 

Other shit that I've heard

- Black women only like dating thugs, or have some thug ex who causes problems because he isn't over her or she isn't really over him.

- They claim that black women tend to be loud and obnoxious, and less educated on average

-And yes some feel that black features are less attractive. Which as a black man, I don't get this when another black man (fully black, not mixed) says this kind of stuff. I have a nose and lips and hair that's pretty average for black people. I've never been ashamed of that, and if I'm making fun of that or saying that's ugly, aren't I just saying that I don't feel like I'm attractive? Of course my nose isn't that big, but that's not a problem on others. My lips aren't that big, but I fucking loooooooooooove women with nice luscious lips. And I've always been attracted to the darker skin than lighter skin.

I see a lot of guys of other races talk about how they wouldn't date a full black women, or a black woman who isn't close to white. My mother is a very light lady, her features aren't very black but my dad is dark and his features are, and I came out in the middle of their complexions and features. 

I see these guys and they always tend to post ""black"" women who are as close to white as they can get without actually being white. This means racial ambiguous Lisa Bonet type ladies with the curly natural hair who are obviously biracial. I've seen some guys of other races who like black with with brown skin, African features, and natural hair. I've known some men of other races who like black women with weaves and such, and just don't care about how a woman's hair and stuff looks.

But point here is, no. I don't feel that black women are inherently undesirable. But I think that some people think that all black women are  stereotype. I really don't think any other race should be judging our features either. Because we can't change our DNA, and why should we want to?"

I crave the emotional connection that comes from actual sex with another person, and comes from a relationship in general. It's been a while and now more than ever I want to enjoy a healthy and fulfilling relationship, not jack off to people who probably aren't really enjoying the sex.

ajustin118,AskMen,1389542676.0,"Dude, be honest with yourself first: Are you actually willing to change?

We get a lot of these posts on AM and it usually sounds like the OP is coming from a good place, but as they start to respond to the comments, you slowly realize that the OP doesn't want to change himself.

You must improve yourself. And I'm not just talking about confidence. Yes, confidence is key. But confidence won't help you at all if you don't find a way to be where women are AND demonstrate it to them.

**FIRST things FIRST: WORK OUT [/r/Fitness]  and EAT HEALTHY [/r/keto] and DRESS WELL [/r/malefashionadvice]**

Jeez, give yourself a fighting chance. It'll make you feel more confident and women will be more receptive to you if you look like you got your shit together.

**SECOND: TALK to EVERYONE. Be hyper-social. This is what a lot of guys who come to /r/AskMen in your position have trouble with.**

They always say, ""Ajustin118, I'm an introvert. I like being by myself. I want to meet girls who like to play video games and like talking about programming, dude. Why can't I just be myself!""

And I say, ""Have fun being alone..."" 

There are girls who like doing that kind of stuff, but most girls don't. You're playing a numbers game, spread your net as wide as possible. Look, I'm an introvert too, but I've learned that social competency/intuition is like a muscle. The more you work it, the stronger it becomes. TALK to EVERYONE, talk to all girls (skinny and overweight, hot and plain, introverted and extroverted, etc...). You need to learn how to be comfortable around women. You need to learn how to have options. You need to learn how to not be hung up on one girl. You need to improve yourself.

Accept every invitation to hang out, join lots of clubs/volunteer organizations/committees, join online dating sites, do whatever it takes to meet people. You must be AGGRESSIVELY SOCIAL.

Being socially competent/charismatic simply means that you CONTRIBUTE VALUE to any social situation in which you find yourself. 

**THIRD: Learn how to sexually escalate. Be Sexually assertive.**

 This is what separates the champs from the chumps. Don't be apologetic about your sexual desires, don't be one of those guys who says, ""Ummm...I think you're cute...oh god, this is awkward...uhh...sorry, just kidding."" Ugh...

If you're socially well-adjusted, your social instincts are probably somewhat well-developed. TRUST YOURSELF. This is a key component of confident interactions. If you want to kiss a girl...kiss her. If you want to hold her hand...grab it as if you've been dating her for the last 6 months. If she's not attracted to you, she'll rebuff your advance.

**FOURTH: Realize that rejection is a good thing. It gives you valuable information.**

If she doesn't like you, move on. If there's one thing that modern women know how to do, it's how to say NO. If she says NO, move on. But at the same time, know the difference between NO and NOT YET.

Go on, young padawan learner and sharpen your skills."

Amonette2012,lifehacks,1389542704.0,"I'm 33 and so ticklish that I've really hurt people who have tried to tickle me when I wasn't expecting it - out of pure instinct.

I'm guessing you're referring here to the incredibly annoying problem with ticklishness - it can ruin the mood when you're trying to be intimate with someone else. Nothing kills a romantic mood more than one person suddenly squirming and giggling. 

The good news is that you can learn to control it. I usually tell anyone I'm dating that I'm super ticklish, and if they touch my stomach, sides or inner thighs they need to use firm pressure and not a light touch, or I will become super sensitive and won't be able to stand being touched at all. I also find that if you're mentally prepared to be touched in a ticklish place it's a little easier. So for example if I see a guy I'm dating walking up to me and I know that he's likely to slip his arm around me, I'm expecting it and it won't tickle. If we're in bed and he wants to spoon me I know what to expect, and I can think 'it's ok I'm expecting this, it's not a tickle it's a hug' and that sort of stops me jumping when the touch comes. Once someone is touching me, I find that as long as I kind of tell myself that it doesn't tickle I'm ok with it. However if someone sets you off, that's it, you're out. Take five minutes, go to the bathroom, make a drink, do something else and wait until your sensitivity goes back down again, then try again. Don't try and push through it, it's just going to be frustrating for the other person.

Also, try and work out why you're ticklish - often there's a reason. I can't stand people touching my stomach because when I was younger I had some medical problems that meant doctors were always poking my stomach, and it made me sensitive. I also have mild post traumatic shock syndrome, which means unexpected touch is very unpleasant for me. Knowing this, it's easier to relax if I'm being touched by someone I want to touch me, because I know that this shouldn't set me off. I mentally separate it from the reasons I'm ticklish if that makes any sense.

TL:DR: There isn't a cure for ticklishness that I'm aware of, but with time you'll find your own workarounds."

Edit: The defensive bits are important as well but you really should figure out simple survival before you worry about that, build a couple test forts after you get used to the layout of things, and then you should start with liquids which I have almost figured out."

Megawatts19,Saints,1389542725.0,"I think one of two things needs to happen. The coaches need to seriously work on his physicality this off season, or they need to permanently make him a WR and make Ben Watson the starting TE. Jimmy just flat isn't getting it done in the trenches. When you hi him in the mouth play after play, he gives up. He was mentally checked out halfway through the first quarter of the Seattle game.

Herein lies the problem. Physicality isn't a physical tool. It's a mindset. Jimmy's playing timid. He lets other people manhandle him. Once that happens he, more or less, submits. I don't know how you train someone to go from a passive mindset to a physical ""don't give a shit"" attitude. But if he wants to be an effective tight end, that's what needs to happen. You have to have all the receiving intangibles of a receiver an all the toughness and grittiness of a lineman. Right now, he's just a big receiver.

FormatA,BuyItForLife,1389542900.0,It's a little silly to blame the manufacturing process too. Stamped could be just as strong if not stronger (due to being cold worked) it's just that they probably make the machines ones out of thicker or better metal. It's undoubtedly more expensive to make than stamp of the same strength.

I haven't done anything to treat any of the discoloration left behind, BUT, I am taking oodles of vitamin E to combat the dryness that comes from using accutane. And I believe that that is what has helped my skin heal up so well. I've noticed that even if I get a cut on, say, my arm, the cut heals faster and leaves less of a scar now than it would have before I started this regimen. My skin is just all around healthier and is much better at healing.

The dermatologist has suggested that I get treated with an ablative (I think) laser in order to treat the pigmentation. However, insurance doesn't pay for that and it's expensive, so I have yet to do that :P"
IntellegentIdiot,AskUK,1389542918.0,"No, it's not different. Your description matches the way things are here. The only difference is that network tv has advertising and is funded by adverts. The BBC (but not CH4 or Five or any freeview channel) is funded by the license fee but anyone can watch they're just breaking the law if they do so without paying for a license. 

Also telecom refers to telephony rather than broadcasting. British Telecom ran/run the telephone system in Britain and also act as an ISP.

Even if services like Netflix become popular, people are still going to watch TV and as a result pay the TV license fee"

As for the upgrades, +15 weapons are always stronger than elemental weapons, as long as you have good stats. The interesting thing about the Gargoyle Halberd is that it's actually much stronger when elemental than the other Halberds are. For example, Chaos Halberd has an AR of 571, while Chaos Gargoyle Halberd has an AR of 599. So if you do decide to go chaos, Gargoyle Halberd is actually a very good choice. That being said, the normal Halberd is a bit faster and can do a few combos quicker, plus it does thrust damage which will be very useful at a certain point later in the game.

p3ndulum,PurplePillDebate,1389543222.0,"My understanding of politics is that it's, in fact, the *minority* that decides what the goals are, and then spends a great deal of time, energy and resources in an effort to convince the majority that it's in their best interest to align with them.

On a micro level, smaller groups just go along with whatever the most influential members of their tribes think and do, ala the popular kids at school. 

Much of the time, the less influential members of the collective feel too insecure and/or intimidated by the idea of going against the grain.

As far as education goes, we're all just basically learning how to think and behave the way our authorities want us to think and behave, usually through a conditioning process that includes intimidation and negative consequences.

As an example, it's been argued that the education system - at least in North American - has been modified to favour how girls learn, forcing boys to homogenize into the system lest they be punished in some way or even medicated for acting out or being rambunctious. The fact that fewer boys are finishing high school or going on to college and university might be evidence of that.

Effectively, the education system is filtering out certain cognitions and awarenesses, deeming them unfavourable or invaluable, while pushing a specific type of awareness and cognition through. As a result, the same types of ideologies continue to establish those ""goals"" that the collective is expected to align with.

So this ""progress"" isn't anything more than a system of elitism and alienation, at least from a social and educational point of view.

As far as science and technology goes, there isn't any real ""progress"" going on. Rather, it's just the discovery of what has always been there to discover. It's the manipulation of resources and material matter.

A universal truth is that everything is always decomposing and breaking. There is no actual ""progression"" happening. Any ""progression"" that you're perceiving is really only that - a matter of perception.

Look around you - humans are destructive by nature, and the fabric of society has been gradually been ripping apart for years now. What some people consider ""progress"", at least from *my* perspective, is a increasingly hedonistic, impulsive degenerate society.

Family values are being replaced with selfishness and materialism. We talk about how important the environment is, but continue to increase our consumption. The rich are becoming richer, and the poor are becoming poorer. Everybody is just living and partying on credit and pretending that everything is groovy.

So I laugh when I hear or read somebody suggest that we're making ""progress"". I can't help but believe them to be delusional, or just a straight up fool."

Pardon me if I'm wrong, but Paul Walker was not Leonardo Decaprio, Idris Elba Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Morgan Freeman, Joseph Gordon Levitt, or Christian Bale type guy.

He was a go to pretty boy for when you needed a pretty boy for a B or B+ summer action flick. Sure, the Fast and The Furious Movies were fun movies to turn your mind off too and chill out in a theater. But lets stop acting like this guy was an Academy Award winning or even nominated guy, putting on 10/10 performances in movies that people are going to remember.

Cool guy, but chances are that if Paul Walker were still alive, he'd be doing a few more Fast and Furious movies, some more movies you wouldn't hear about in some years and then faded into obscurity before the 2010s ended.

Life-in-Death,vegan,1389543338.0,"Thanks for this.  This is really interesting and I have not heard of it before.  

The number one question it brings up is, it seems like the entire basis is if the protein is ""complete"" or not.  As in, if all of the amino acids aren't there to complete the needed job, then the ones that are present will just be excreted as unusable.
&gt;For example, if a hypothetical muscle protein requires phenylalanine (an essential amino acid), then this must be provided in the diet for the muscle protein to be produced. If the current protein source in the diet has no phenylalanine in it the muscle protein cannot be produced, giving a low usability and BV of the protein source.

I was fairly confident that the knew thought was as long as you ate a wide enough variety of protein in 24 hours, (which WHO says could even be done by eating 9 white potatoes a day) you didn't have to worry about complete proteins.

Maybe that point is addressed here: 
&gt;In particular the BV value of a food varies depending on its preparation and the recent diet of the organism.

I also wonder how the value for plants and animal foods might differ if this wasn't done:
&gt;If critical minerals or vitamins are missing from the protein source this can result in a massively lowered BV. Many BV tests artificially add vitamins and minerals (for example in yeast extract) to prevent this.

But Soy Beans still come in at #2 behind eggs: 
&gt;Whole Soy Bean: 96 [12}

But surprisingly:
&gt;Soybean curd (tofu): 64[12]


But then the values are taken at low intake, and they said the higher the protein intact overall, the lower the BV, so once again this may be a boon for plant sources.
&gt;For example, milk protein shows a BV near 100 at intakes of 0.2 g/kg. As protein intake increases to roughly maintenance levels, 0.5 g/kg, BV drops only around 70.[22] 

And of course:
&gt;Lastly, the use of rats for the determination of protein quality is not ideal. Rats differ from humans in requirements of essential amino acids

Of course, doing human trials with this would be difficult.  

Anyway, thanks again.  This is an interesting concept.  It does seem like the BV value correlates with the ""amino acid completeness"" values as I vaguely remember them.  I would assume the value of something like wheat gluten would go up significantly if paired with a complementary protein."

""Theism"" means something along the lines of ""belief in deities"". So, if you put it all together, ""atheism"" (which by the way should not be capitalized) means ""lack of belief in deities"". There is no set atheist agenda or set of beliefs. People like the late Christopher Hitchens or Richard Dawkins are what you would call ""militant atheists"", that is to say they *do* have an agenda, which primarily consists of making religious people feel foolish and pushing the concept of lack of religion on others. However, they are the minority. Many atheists who are above the age of 15 and don't wear fedoras are content to simply not practice any religion and have religion not factor in at all into their lives. Sure, they still get a kick out of seeing things like the FFRF's billboards, or the Festivus pole made of beer cans in front of the nativity scene, but they don't have any set of consistent guidelines or rules, because they *have no religion.* That said, the huge, vast majority of us still observe common sense right-and-wrong rules, like ""don't kill that dude"" or ""don't steal that thing"".

Aaron Swartz was prosecuted for putting a FOR() loop around an otherwise permissible document retrieval request.

There is something notable, worthy of debate, and bitterly ironic about our dispensation of justice and our definition of defense. We are not talking about a kid's passing, we're talking about the ineffectual rule of law. His personal tragedy is a consequence.

From another angle, we are also talking about the hopelessness and isolation that many smart people live with and don't even really know it. Many young people today (""nerds"", whatever) come to discover that they battle with impostor syndrome, depression, anxiety, and shades of autism. These problems are spreading and nobody seems to have a solution.

Newsworthy is what people want it to mean. I'm sorry if you don't have any sympathy for kids like Aaron, revulsion at the relative merits of his case versus this past year's NSA revelations, or empathy with the rest of us who do. But, alas, lack of interest in the concerns of others is not news."

By the way, did you know the first thing he says to Richard, 'Cubitum Eamus?' means 'Shall we lie down together?'

I personally sympathized the most with Richard, because of his stoic, patient nature and because of my personal experiences (insecurity).

There are tons of different types of apps you may want to build. 

For many of them, native is in fact the best way to go. 

If you don't care about cross platform compatibility, or if you're making a game or a music app or something to do with manipulating graphics, definitely go native. 

If you're making what many / most apps are, which is essentially a custom skinned data browser, web apps often work just great. Especially if you're interested in making it work on multiple devices (e.g. Android and iOS and maybe Windows phone) 

A big part of past performance issues of Web apps on Android has been Google's awful / poorly performing webkit implementation. I prefer Google products over Apple's, but their webkit sucked horrendously until recently.

You said in another comment that you have people who'd watch your daughter while you're on a date, but that it would be awkward to ask them to watch her while you go out to try to pick up women. I think you should ask someone to watch your daughter while you go out and *have fun.* This doesn't need to be about picking up women -- you need to make some adult friends and expand your social circle. I would recommend finding some regularly-scheduled activity that you can go to once a week or so. I don't know your hobbies, but there are lots of options on Meetup.com, or you could look for local churches, volunteer opportunities, athletic leagues, gaming clubs, etc. Right now you say you feel socially isolated. You will be happier if you have more friends and more opportunities for low-pressure social interaction. Plus, it's very important to not make the woman you date feel like she is responsible for 100% of your personal life.

Specific to OKC: I would suggest not mentioning being a widower on your profile, just because a lot of people make their OKC profiles very light, and it could be a bit of a jarring surprise to readers. I'd suggest bringing it up early, though, maybe in messages before your first date, if it comes up in conversation (I can imagine someone asking, ""So you have a little girl... is her mom in the picture?"") or after one or two dates. Don't make it a deep, dark secret. People are going to be uncomfortable because they don't know what to say and don't want to make you upset, so I think it might also help if you're prepared with a line like, ""I know this is a heavy topic but I can understand why you'd be curious. We can talk about it or we can save that conversation for later, I just don't want you to feel weird about it."" "

Feroc,changemyview,1389544430.0,"I guess it's all more depending on the actual situation, I'll try to explain our situation better with those questions you've asked.

&gt; But why shouldn't you pool all your money - then you'd always be helping your wife, and she'd always be helping you. There wouldn't be guilt in asking for money from you, there wouldn't be the expectation that you get to decide what is done with the majority of the money.

That's not how is it working for us. I'll give you a bit of an insight: We have 3 bank accounts, one for each person and a combined one. From the combined one we pay everything that is for both of us: power, water, food, internet, etc. We need about 800â¬ each month for that, I transfer 450â¬, she 350â¬ each month. Of course we're not nitpicking there, I am not paying extra hot potato chips separately, neither does she pay separately for a special shampoo or something like that.

If we want to buy something big together (new sofa, new table, vacation or something like that), then we do it the same way, we split and I pay a bit more. 

We are married for 3 years now (together for about 10 years) and it actually never happened that I had to give her money because she couldn't afford something she wanted. So there is no guilt in asking in our situation.

On the other hand I think it could be even more complicated, if we only would have one bank account and one pool of money. Because then I would feel like I need to explain why I buy this or that. My wife feels the same. She loves to buy shoes (such a cliche), not the most expensive ones, most are pretty cheep. She just loves to have some to choose from. But she wouldn't want to tell me every time that she bought a new pair. I on the other hand am a tech guy, when I buy something, it quickly costs 300â¬+ and my wife wouldn't even understand why I need that item.

I guess your question could make sense, if the difference in income is bigger. Like the woman earning a lot of money while the husband does the chores at home or if both of them aren't earning a lot of money."

I believe I was taking something similar to tetracycline before I started on accutane. It definitely helped, but the accutane has just knocked it out of the park. 

I am on the 1.0mg/kg dosage, and I take it daily. The dermatologist had mentioned that others take less, or take it less often, but with my skin being as bad as it was, they saw that it was beneficial to give me this particular regimen.

Skin problems also run in my family. My mom is nearly 50, her sister a few years older, and they both still break out on a regular basis. And we don't just get small pimples, like you can see from the photos. We have cystic acne, so they are more like small sores that tend to stick around and not heal for long periods of time.

I would definitely suggest talking to your dermatologist about other options to boost up your routine. :]"

The only terms under which it is ""simplistic"" to label his software as a back-up would be in light of a law that has rarely been used for good (the CFAA). I chose my words because the Supreme Court has long and repeatedly held that users have a right to keep multiple copies of information without permission, and in express violation, of the copyright license. Finally, I'm led to believe that Harvard students customarily are granted access to the materials of MIT. I don't know about that last bit. If that is true, then there is plenty of reason to believe that his case was unjust.

Injustice caused by government being the reason for the fourth estate, I think that it is plenty newsworthy to discuss the events of his life without assuming the relevant written definitions of contract or law. Instead I think we should talk about the merits of the people on both sides, the actions which only the DA seemed to think were injurious, and the systems by which both of those sets were brought to bear on each other.

In particular, I think that subscription-based access to archives is contrary to the longest term fundamental value of universities in general. I thought that was a value I shared with him. Perhaps I have underestimated the complexity of his position.

The rest do not fit into the Buddhist mould, and Buddhist advice and counsel is counterproductive.

Wow this part is racist and offensive. We are not ""stuck"" with Indian, Chinese, and ""Eastern-style"" people (horrible breakdown of traditional Buddhist communities in Asia, btw) as if they are some type of burden. They certainly aren't ""mythic"" in this racist ""noble savage"" kind of way the author is portraying ""Eastern-style"" people. He probably thinks ""they all look the same"" too. Disgusting.

And his position about monasteries is downright cold. It is a consequence of capitalist economics to measure an individual's worth based on how much they produce material goods and services. That may be perfectly fine for studying economics, but maybe there's more to a person than how much they are ""useful"" in a material way? Perhaps."

GetOffMyLawn_,Fibromyalgia,1389545013.0,"Oh yes, this is me! I can feel my blood pressure go up from barking dogs and loud music. And I've had tinnitus since I was 5. It's always there to one degree or another, anything from a background hiss to loud ringing or deafness in one or both ears. It's more like an old friend now than an annoyance.

Get foam earplugs. They're cheap and disposable. Supposedly wax and cotton ones work better, but they're pricier and not as easy to fit in your ear. There was an /r/lifeprotips the other day about soundproofing an apartment, check out some of the advice there. There are cheap ways to do it too. You may want to convert one room into your sound-proofed haven.

You don't say if you're in a house or an apartment. If you're in an apartment and have a lease you are probably entitled to the quiet enjoyment of your apartment. At which point you are entitled to complain to the landlord about the noise and he/she must control it. I had to do this with a crazy neighbor. I suspect the landlord told them to tone it down or get evicted. 

White noise machines can help, it can be something as simple as a fan, or you can get an app for your tablet that produces tons of white noise sounds. There are also youtube videos for white noise, pink noise and gray noise. Play your own music, use headphones.

As for tinnitus I would use meditation/stress reduction and/or cognitive behavior therapy to make it more liveable. Growing up I didn't regard it as a problem, just one of those interesting things my body does. I am unaware of it 99% of the time. It's there, I just have to tune into it to notice it. Having other sounds (white noise, music) around helps to mask it."

silverionmox,europe,1389545198.0,"&gt; Absolutely yes. People should've been asked wether they were okay with the catastrophe that would be inflicted upon them

They legitimately delegated that decision power, and a referendum wouldn't have given a different outcome. It becoming a catastrophe was contingent on a lot of other policy options in any case.

&gt;but the guy who decided they didn't matter is the same who falsified the country's stats in order for it to join the EU. Did I mention he's a Goldman Sachs employee ?

Politics is not just declaring what is right and just. Politics also is dealing with wrongs and unjustice after they happened.

&gt;When you have to change a tire and the mechanic tells you it's gonna cost you 5k euros instead of 10k, something should tell you you're getting ripped off. Creditors don't simply kiss dozens of billions of euros goodbye.

They did so because a Greek default would be a 100% loss instead of a 50% loss.

&gt;The euro in itself is not viable (see Optimal Currency Area and Asymmetric shocks theories and Target 2 / Bundesbank sheet completely gorged with claims, which are in turn claims on rotten banks)

You cannot just declare *te* euro not to be viable. That depends on a lot of variables and policy options.

&gt;When the euro disappears, the Greek drachma is expected to lose 30% of its value compared to the dollar, so I don't know where you're going with a 100% price increase of imported goods.

To get the same result (a 50% debt cut), they would have had to devalue with 50%. That means a Greek wage only has about 50% of the buying power it had for imports, effectively doubling the prices in real terms.

&gt;No, in fact, some countries were better for it. Not everyone is fine with a strong currency.

The dispute is not about having a strong currency or not. The Greeks can be perfectly fine in the Eurozone working at low wages, if that's what they wish. The problem was that they didn't want that, but didn't have the economy to go along with it... so they had to resort to periodic devaluations whenever reality caught up with wishful thinking. Now they no longer have that option, but have to devalue wages and prices directly. This is a normal adjustment, and not different from what they were doing already.

What makes the crisis particularly hard for Greece is the additional discrepancy caused by the cooked books. They should have entered the eurozone at a lower exchange rate; if they did, they wouldn't have to fall so deep right now.

&gt;Nobel in economics prize recipients like Friedman, Mundell, Stiglitz and Krugman were right all along about the political and economic problems the euro was going to cause. Any comment about how an EU exit would be apocalyptic should be taken with a grain of salt, since their authors also said the euro would bring prosperity to the European peoples. The events made them lose all credibility.

For every economist saying something, you can find two who say the opposite. All these guys also said the eurozone would crash before it even come off the ground, which didn't happen. Fact is that this credit crisis would have happened anyway, euro or not. I do agree that the ECB shouldn't have been so anal about inflation. But that's not a fundamental problem with the Eurozone, it's a disagreement about policy.

Blaming the euro just takes away attention from the real problem that caused the crisis, fractional reserve banking.

&gt;Anything in that spirit is fear-mongering, brainwashing and propaganda, unfortunately lost on downvoters in this subreddit who are not able to debate rationally.

awp235,AskReddit,1389545212.0,"Actually an engine is designed in a way that an entirely open throttle is the most efficient way to run it. That is why a little econobox gets great gas mileage on the highway, because the closer the throttle is to fully open, the more efficient it runs. So if you had a small engine in a car, so small that with the pedal on the floor the car could only hit a measly 70 mph, that car would get far superior gas mileage than my 3.2 v6 in my acura tl, at 70 mph, because since my throttle isn't wide open the car isn't running at peak efficiency. I'm not sure about parts and wear and such, but when I consider that my friends  '94 accord has 250k miles on the clock, and cruising at 75 mph(which it has most of it's life) the engine is spinning at like 4k rpm or some weirdly high number, that engine is still running. Smaller engines, notoriously Japanese engines, are made to spin that fast for their entire lives. Then you consider motorcycles, where you have motorcycles that will ru clearly cruise at 6k+ rpm on the highway, with thousands of miles on them, you've got to think that the engines are made for that.

Otherwise, I completely agree, I've been to a few EF Low Masses and they just leave me feeling incredibly spiritually dry and underwhelmed. I almost feel like I haven't been to Mass at all if I go to one.

As it stands, the brain is almost certainly a biological 'computer', but the word itself is misleading.

And sure, we might eventually be able to recreate a human brain or simulate a human mind, but we might as well find that a termite mound is a better model for its description than a computer. So until we can tell for sure, computer analogies (especially when used in reply to such a outlandish question as OP's) are not much more than a source for potential confusion."

ajustin118,relationship_advice,1389545609.0,"i feel for you, but I'm going to give you some medicine (read: honesty) and it's not going to taste good. Brace yourself:

You are a phony. You're not in love, you're in lust. You've convinced yourself that you're in love to cope with her selfish behavior.

&gt; TL;DR - Told girl I fell for her a while ago. She didn't provide closure with an answer. Spent months getting closer to each other. Now I brought it up again because I had to cut myself off from her, and she told me she had no idea I fell for her in the first place.

WTF? She didn't even respect you enough to reject you, let alone acknowledge your feelings.

My advice: Get rid of her. She's not attracted to you at all (and she may not even like you that much...I mean, she obviously doesn't respect you.) But she does feel comfortable with you. You're a safe guy...she can share her feelings with you/spend obscene amounts of time with you and you won't even try to hook up with her. Just walk out of her life. Don't ask for closure. Why? She won't give it to you. Why won't she give it to you? Because she can keep you around longer by withholding it from you.

The reason why you got caught up in this mess is because you don't have options.
&gt; Since we met, I've been very lonely (I have never been with anyone before)
She's your only source of emotional intimacy. 

You need to flirt with other girls, go on dates and hook up. Your loneliness/neediness makes you inherently unattractive because you are too available.

Protip: In situations like this, it's easy to become frustrated/angry/bitter. It's okay to feel that way for a little while. but you must move on if you want to do well with women in the future. There's something inherently attractive about positivity. "

I go to church/life groups during the week hoping to read God's word and then discuss it, what does it mean, can we trust it, how do we apply it etc, but most other people there seem really content to just have it explained to them the way that the preacher/leader has interpreted it and take it all at face value. I think they think I'm some sort of anarchist dissident, just because I choose to question certain things... I don't think I'm particularly antagonistic, but I do often wonder how we know that certain parts are written by God through man, rather than being tainted by some selfish agenda etc... 

Also I seem to get bogged down in the more thoughtful, almost existentialist areas of belief, and nobody ever seems to want to discuss that either. Like, why would God allow us to sin? Free will is great, but if He knew so many of us were going to turn away from Him, wouldn't it have been kinder/more loving to make us all robots unable to do so??

I do call myself a Christian because I am able to hold onto the fundamental beliefs in the resurrection of Jesus, but so many other things leave me so confused and doubting, and it's disheartening sometimes when it feels like everybody else is happy to be told what to believe without actually having to question it....

There are some rare sexual side effects to finasteride, so some people (like me) avoid it. I use Nizoral (you can find it at walmart for $15) three times a week, and liquid form minoxidil twice a day (although I forget to a lot).

Now, the new logic is 'merchants everywhere are starting to accept bitcoin, but they are trading it directly to usd, and therefore, it will never gain value because so many merchants are selling it for usd'

But the latter contradicts the former.  If 'everyone' starts accepting bitcoin (even if they convert immediately back to USD), then this will bring up a new wave of people who work for a BTC paychecks and not USD.  Soon, their entire savings will be in BTC.  Why?  Because 'everyone' accepts it.  And as the value grows, it is only a matter of time before these merchants begin retaining part of their profits in BTC (either to pay employees, or to pay vendors).  Then we're to that moon.

vidurnaktis,TumblrInAction,1389545950.0,"There's no such thing as right and wrong within language, at least not objectively. And our opinions on right and wrong within it are formed by the subjective opinions of those around us (teachers, parents, &amp;c.). Truth is, no one speaks this idealised ""correct"" English, we can speak a standard (or a form of a standard rather) but we all fall back to the language we acquired (different from learnt) as a child. 

At the end point you're conflating writing styles with language. How someone writes on the internet is not directly correlated with their speech (though sometimes speech can leak into writing). Leetspeak and other internet styles would not be ""dialects"" because dialects are only formed from speech, within speech communities. 

And now a question, do you think we should go back to speaking the ""pure"", ""unadulterated"" Indo-European tongue? Because English is just a bastardised version of it, as is French and Farsi and Hindi and especially those damn Afrikaans. "

 this is not how the internet currently works. You can imagine the current internet (sites such as reddit) as a series of spokes coming from a center. the spokes run from a central server to a personal computer.

What the article seems to suggest is that , instead of this spoked wheel like model, you join everything to everything. There is no longer a centralised server that can be taken down and each personal computer talks directly to the others. The information you need for a site, is requested in small chunks from several of your peers, not a server.

I think they kept the article simple to save confusion. Even with the level of detail given the article seems to have caused confusion for you, so im not sure why you would call for more technical detail."

Aquinas had no way of knowing that time and the universe are linked.  Thus the question of what was before the universe is nonsensical.  Much like asking what is above the universe. There is no before since time did not exist without the universe. 

Same with Greek philosophers trying to understand the nature of matter without understanding chemistry.  They could not know the interactions that made all physical things how they were. 

Same with naturalists before evolution was discovered. Who assumedd that mothers were able to choose the traits of offspring using conditioning on themselves.

Favourite TV show right now: *Arrow*. Has some soap-y elements but other than that it has phenomenal acting and writing. Sometimes I think that the writers should take it easy before they run out of ideas. But they really push the story forward all the time which is really nice (there are enough other shows that only build up their story and it takes forever for some kind of pay-off).

He said they got a call from a woman claiming that there was constant banging from the room above her that would wake her up at night, but there was no one living there. He went up and checked, nothing out of the usual and whatnot. I can't remember the nitty-gritty details but the guy found out later that the previous occupant of the room had committed suicide by kicking a chair from beneath their feet and hanging themselves from the ceiling-mounted fan (or something along those lines, it was a hanging at least).

 You can probably still find the show on YouTube because most of them are archived by fans, but I can't for the life of me remember which one it was. Something's making me think it was 98'-99', but I can't be too sure.

p3ndulum,PurplePillDebate,1389546423.0,"I think that I just have an issue with the concept of progress as a holistically ""good"" thing.

It's like ""profit"" and how we rarely ever consider where the deficit is - because you can't have a ""profit"" without there being a deficit somewhere. I suppose I view ""progress"" the same way in that it requires energy and movent - change. So where one person or group thinks that they are making progress, it's quite likely that it is coming at the expense of se other group. Or, at what expense or cost will it take to eliminate world hunger, as an example.

So I don't believe in ""progress"", just ""change"". Things are just always ""changing"". The chips are just being pushed around the table so to speak, and those whose stacks are growing are satisfied in there current ""progress"" while the guy across the table whose chips are dwindling isn't feeling so good about things.

To close, consider that everything has it's place. If a thing isn't given the room to occupy that space, it's forced to fill another space - a space which it's not suited for, creating stress and dishormy in the system.

I would say then, I guess, real ""progress"" can't happen until each individual - in the case of the human race - is granted allowance to find and fill their ""space"". Unfortunately, our current political, education and economic systems rely on scarcity and forced homogenization, resulting in a great deal of displacement within it.

Our society, effectively, is a *machine* the way that it's set up now, working to create an intellectual concept or ideal or ideology. Those who don't subscribe or can't fit are cast out or left behind.

Realistically, the goals that are being establish only work for or benefit certain archetypes.

I dunno, maybe we just like to *think* that we're in control, but it's really our DNA that is pulling the strings and running the show, and we're just rationalizing that we know where we're actually headed."

wannaridebikes,Buddhism,1389546458.0,"&gt;I'm confident my comments are perhaps so late in the discussion as to have no impact, but here goes...  

&gt;*Sex with his students:* Right intention and no sexual misconduct.  Has anyone ever heard of polyamory?  Everyone here is attaching the victim mentality to people he had sex with and then labeling the ones who didn't complain as ""cultish"".  This was also post 60s, post-hippie Nixon scandal, Vietnam-weary America.  The world *was* fucking ending for many of these people at the time I was spitting up formula on my mom's shoulder.  I can't judge those people and their actions because I wasn't there.  None of us have no fucking idea was in their heads, yes, probably drug addled as much as trungpa.  Call it justifying, but I see it as all his raw fearlessness in seeing thru the eyes of the sufferer.  Which leads me to the next point.  

Lol I am polyamorous and I still say what he did was wrong. Polyamory is about consent. His wife certainly did not consent. Why was she upset when she found out? Why did she cry? This is not how poly works. He wasn't poly. He was an adulterer. 

And it's unethical to sleep with students put specifically under his spiritual charge.

&gt;*Alcoholism:* Right intention, right effort, and no heedlessness.  Again, call me an apologist, but I stand by my conclusions that he was soaking in the western world and all of its neuroses, and despite those impairments he was able to cut through and still offer insight.  *And people still discuss those insights to this day.*  If he were merely a con people wouldn't be *still* discussing the validity of his teachings.  That he did it while so impaired just blows my (admittedly simple) mind.

He is still being brought up because his legacy has the cash behind it to still be able to publish his works. This has nothing to do with how ""insightful"" or not his ideas were. An insightful person can have the means to leave a legacy, but so can a con man. 

&gt;*Osel:* yep. Osel was a lying, narcissistic opportunist that took full advantages of Trungpa's good faith.  Despite what clear actions Osel did even before Trungpa's death he *still* had faith in Osel's basic goodness.  Imagine a Buddhist doing that! Even to the danger of the integrity of the organization that he spent so many years building.  My view on that?  Trungpa was dealing with the worldly dharmas without a full capacity to transcend his human form.  I have compassion for Trungpa for (what was clearly then an looking back now) a regrettable action.  

Even to the destruction of other beings? That's ""idiot"" compassion and there's nothing wise about it.

&gt;Any of this inner circle stuff is bound to be distorted by other misguided humans that may have been clouded by their own baggage.  

Or he wasn't all that clear in the first place.

&gt;For *me*, I have great respect for what he said and made an effort to spread.  Yes, Zen paved the way prior to his arrival, as well as Vipassana/insight coming around just a few years prior, but he popularized *his* tradition in *his* own unique way.

Yes his tradition. Not Buddhism.  

&gt;He is a fascinating study in spreading a very complex tradition in a very relatable way for western ears, and yet his humanity in all its ugliness stlll came through despite everything he knew.  It's a very relatable struggle.

He showed little to no intention on dealing with his own vices, but promoted them as a Buddhist path instead. This isn't the position of a good teacher. I have no problem with a teacher who is struggling, but he portrayed his vices as virtues. Two completely different approaches.

Walt's primary stated motivation was to take care of his family, but his other motivation really was to become more badass. I loved the disconnect between those things in the show. They were the building blocks of so much conflict. We the audience wanted Walt to become more badass long before the character realized and accepted it as his own motivator -- it took until the last episode for him to say aloud that he enjoyed the 'work'. I think it was successful writing in that it really got the audience to anticipate Walt's development.

There just isn't a silver bullet when it comes to malware. You need to apply several forms of defense: do use anti-virus and keep it updated. Keep your OS updated, as well as all the software programs that you use. Be aware and responsible, actually read dialog boxes as they appear and make conscious decisions, rather than blindly clicking OK.

Pro-tip: use something like noscript and set it to disallow execution of scripts by default. Selectively whitelist the sites you must use, try to figure out if you trust them, also. In general, disable all third-party content, unless you understand what they are doing and are OK with it. When you allow something, allow temporarily rather than permanently.

All of this is very inconvenient, but being caught by cryptolocker is even more inconvenient.

for a flash you really need to bounce the light, so you need a tilt/swivel head and as more power as possible, TTL metering won't do much for that so it's safe to go off-brand. If you have the money just go for the 7 or 9 series of flashes from nikon. As for the lens, a wide to normal zoom will do, the 17-50/2.8 from Sigma or Tamron are quite nice for the price and should handle 95%+ of situations.

If you want to go for something more exotic, go for an ultra-wide zoom (10-20, even 8-16) and a ringflash, the results can be [very interesting](http://flic.kr/p/8QKL7z), though obviously it can't be your only setup"

I'd love to see an extra % return for larger creeps via his passive.

Formal parties work like this, but small meetings don't. When I call my sister to have lunch together when I happen to be in the city where she works, that doesn't mean I'm going to pay her dinner.

&gt;What will oftentimes happen, even when SRS is not invoked, is someone makes a comment which is controversial, it gets voted up, someone replies pointing out that it is controversial, then the discussion gets noticed by everyone and lots of voting occurs. Many times this behaviour starts happening before subreddits like SRS or SRD even start linking to it. 

You were arguing that the negative scores for antifeminists and the positive scores for feminists indicated that SRS users were voting on the thread. He provides an alternate explanation for the phenomena.

No reddit admin approves of brigading. Here, /u/alienth says that if SRS did brigade, he would ban them.

&gt;The cases where folks from SRS engage in rule-breaking is rather low for their subreddit size. When we do catch folks from SRS actually engaging in brigading or doxxing, we ban them, just like any other subreddit. If SRS gets to a point where that becomes endemic and the mods and us are not able to control it, the subreddit will get banned.

If I get any more (which I might) it will be in a spot that is generally covered by clothing on my back or torso or upper thigh. As for where I don't like them - face, neck, hands, lower back (aka ""tramp stamp"") and there are some areas that I like on a man but not on a woman (for example, chest tattoos).

namer98,math,1389547764.0,"I took adderal on my long days (4 hours of class) and sometimes on my shorter days (3 hours or less of class). It honestly did not help so much with paying attention in a class where the teacher just was an awful lecturer. But it did help with time management and actually sitting down to do stuff. 

However, I felt that the adderall did not allow me to think as creatively, and had problems doing the problem sets! Particularly real analysis where sometimes it was just put epsilon into a random fraction because that was a thing.

What helped me the most was understanding time management and how to get homework done in a timely manner. What helped the most with this besides the adderall was having homework groups. I would meet one group on Tuesday evenings, and another group Thursday mornings. It worked well, and it also meant we can bounce ideas around. ADHD or not, homework groups are awesome.

Today, I do some math in my excel heavy job (financial assistant) and take adderall because the assistant part of the job was doing thank you notes for tax deductible donations. And even now when the job is 80% excel work, the adderall helps with focus and time management.

The lack of interest of their own future is the biggest social problem. They prefer to study away from the family and receive money to spend them in bars and clubs with specific pop-folk music than to earn themselves cash and work.

And since the education is awful you don't become great at the job you prepared for 4 years, you are mediocre. And with mediocre staff the whole company is mediocre. And with mediocre companies the economy is mediocre.

The biggest problem with the education actually is that professors don't show up at their lectures and even exams (!) but still get paid.

Women should not be rewarded for ignorance or glorified for wanting to raise a child without a father from making bad decisions.  A man is legally bound to take care of a child if the woman knows who the father is and there is a confirmed paternity test, even if the man did not want the child to begin with.  It's not an equal system if the woman can abort but a man (or government) can't financially abort.  Those women need to he held accountable for their actions and told that it is not okay to live off the wealth of others just because they made a mistake one (or multiple) evening.  Also, it is not just the man's fault the woman got pregnant.  It takes both genitalia to conceive a child.  Why should only the man be punished for impregnating a woman?

enlightened-giraffe,photography,1389548026.0,"They indicate the aperture of the lens across the zoom range, so you have F3.5 at 18mm, F5.6 at 200mm and intermediate values in between. The aperture value tells you how much light the lens allows through - the lower the number, the more light gets to the sensor. (there are many articles out there explaining aperture and f-numbers in greater detail, as this is a fundamental aspect of photography, google will provide).

As you can see though, the other lenses have very similar f numbers, so it's pretty much the same thing. The 75-300 gives you F4 at 75 mm and your 18-200 is probably F4.5 or past by this point, but it's not a significant difference. Also, none of the other lenses have image stabilization so yes, from most points of view your 18-200 is your best lens and you're not losing out on anything by not using the others (go ahead and sell them).

The only lenses that would really give you something new are ultra wide zooms (like a 10-20), a fast prime (anybody should have a 50/1.8, it's dirt cheap and looks amazing after using only kit zooms) or a wide-aperture zoom (F2.8 is the standard for the big guns, quite expensive as well) "

Developing for a PC is a little different because of the wide variety of configurations. There's no point developing features that only 5% of buyers will ever see, if they can't see it they won't buy the game. I'm sure that developers would jump at the chance to produce better looking games, especially since they could anticipate that there would be a market for the console and games. Those who wrote off Nintendo in the past couldn't do so this time.

SafteyPencil,nursing,1389548269.0,"First of all, as a student, let me say thank you. I really hope this is something you come to enjoy because we need more good preceptors. 

I will try and put your mind at ease about not having a ton of experience. In my clinicals thus far, younger nurses with less time on a floor have been much better than the 15yr+ vets. This is anecdotal but most of my friends in school agree and we all think it can be attributed to this: you still remember what it is like to be a green student who is scared shitless and the older nurses don't or don't care(generalizing/stereotyping here, obviously not all of them). Remember, as nervous as you are, the student is probably much more so. 

Now all people learn differently so all I can say is how I prefer my preceptors. I love it when they explain EVERYTHING. Even if it is something I know how to do, hearing it again reinforces it and I might pick something up from you that I didn't from someone else. Remember that there are easy skills that you think the student should be able to perform that they might not be able to. For example, the hospital we do clinicals at switched their IV pumps and we had to learn a whole new system. I only did a few IVPBs over several weeks and will need a little guidance this next semester to get the repetitions in that will let me be confident in hanging them. Some of my friends got patients where they were hanging several of them every week and others haven't done ONE since the pumps were changed. So if this program is similar, the students will be very different in their skill base and you need to stay with them for awhile to really understand what they are strong at and what needs work. 

The other thing that I would like from preceptors that I don't often see is BE CONSTRUCTIVE! I had one rotation last year that I thought went really well. At the end of it I asked the nurse I was following if she had any feedback I could use, anything I should try to improve, what would make me better. She said, ""Nope, you did great! Good luck!"". It wasn't till I saw my instructor that I found out the nurse told my instructor I could use some work on assessment skills. It is frustrating to have someone go over your head when they could easily tell you. I have since worked on assessments and put more time into that area. Still, I would have done that if she would have told me in the first place. I have worked jobs where I have been screamed at, cursed at, and stuff thrown at me. You won't offend me by nicely telling me what I need to improve, I will be grateful for it!

I could go on but most of the big stuff has been covered by others. I hope you take this as a learning experience yourself as well. Teaching is one of the best ways to further your comprehension of a subject! My favorite way to study for stuff is to help teach material to students who are struggling because it helps me understand it that much better. Thanks again and good luck!"

lunarbizarro,asktransgender,1389548427.0,"My birth name was Chris (just Chris), and I went by it for a number of months. Not because I really liked the name (I liked my new name more), but because I thought it'd be easier for everyone involved. It turns out it was a gigantic hassle for a number of reasons. I'd constantly get fraud screenings with my bank and credit card, because the concept of a woman named Chris was *inconceivable*. Every person I emailed personally (I never used my birth name post-transition at work) would assume I was a guy. Every time at a hotel, I'd have to go through a whole lot of explaining that I was, in fact, who I said I was, and I didn't just steal my husband's credit card.

On the personal side, I found that family and friends had a much harder time adjusting to Chris/she than &lt;new name&gt;/she. I finally just snapped after my mom accidentally called me her son, and told everyone to start calling me by my new name. Now looking at my old name being typed up a bunch, it seems foreign, like it wasn't even my name to begin with..."

Kamchakka,WritingPrompts,1389548475.0,"Trevor was on his way to the mall, pondering over old times. He never really took this route, but it took him past the little park where he used to play in as a small child. He was thinking back to a particularly sunny Wednesday-afternoon, July 9th, 1986. He was playing hide and seek with Rosetta, his neighbour. Rosetta had left with her parents to Scotland,  eight months later. Nowadays, they would send the odd Christmas card, but had grown apart mostly. The Christmas cards had stopped coming the last decade, anyway. 

On that Wednesday, she was wearing her favourite dress, that blue one with little suns on it. Trevor sometimes made it dirty, just to upset Rosetta. Her pink shoes were covered in the dust of the park, moaning under the summer heat. 

After nearly two hours had passed, Rosetta's mother came to pick her up, Lydia was her name. Lydia always had the nicest perfumes on and Trevor was a little bit in love with her. 

But then it hit him. Walking down the street, Trevor could not remember what clothes Lydia was wearing, nor what her hair looked like. He staggered, dreadfully realizing he had forgotten something. He didn't know what to do. Ellie, his wife, was at work and wouldn't be able to come and get him. A few passers-by gave him strange looks, shaking their heads in disdain. After a friendly stranger sat him down on a bench, Trevor tried to focus on his breathing, but the sudden realization he forgot something was still omnipresent in his mind.

For years, he had feared this moment. He didn't know *if* it would happen, but the option of it happening was constantly on his mind. All around him, he saw forgetfulness, some cases worse than others. Never had he fully understood how it was and how it felt. He had accepted he was different than most people long before, but now that he no longer was, he felt naked. Stripped of what he had loved. He hoped it wouldn't decrease any further, though he was sure the chances of that were slim.

*Fast forward one year.*

Trevor was in the hospital. Ellie was by his side, eyes reddened from crying. His son, Michael, was standing next to him. He looked at them, knowing he should remember who these persons were. He tried his best remembering, but was unable to recall any memories, however distant, involving this woman and the adolescent. They had claimed to be his wife and son, but he was not sure if they were telling the truth. During the first days, he lay in bed, wondering why this strange woman was continuously crying next to his bed. Now, he had grown accustomed to it. She, however, had not. 

On what the doctors called good days, Trevor was able to relive his childhood memories. He had asked for Rosetta numerous times, to no avail. A day later, when this person who called himself Michael told Trevor that Rosetta had died, he did not know who Rosetta was.

The doctor came in. She asked if Trevor had already made up his will and, if he hadn't yet, would like to now. Trevor wondered if he was sick. He was sure of the opposite, but didn't see the point of making his will now. These strangers all seemed to behave like he was sick, but he felt fine. If only his wife was here..."

I remember someone waiting in line had something wrong with their uniform and the person behind them got chewed out for not being a good wingman and informing the person in front of them about whatever had been obviously messed up, ponytail out of regs I think.

It seems as if libertarians only read John Locke and ignore every other philosopher to exist who says differently. Life is logical, almost all humans want to extend life and that's why we form societies to begin with. Liberty to a lesser degree because while it should be preserved as much as possible it has to be limited for society to work, but property? I really don't get how property is this important thing that can never be violated. Especially since it seems to at times harm both life and liberty.

Back at'cha

&gt;I date feminists.

Gross....

&gt;That doesn't matter. After a few generations, incest would start, regardless of age.

Ugh, no it wouldn't. I don't think you understand mathamatics or reproductive genetics. The risk of incest would be from second generation children, and past that, it's gone. Even if second generation children of the same father had sex, it would be irrelevant as genetic defects do not, or rarely occur within a single generation. The fear of incest was born from European royalty doing it to keep bloodlines pure, and they did it for several generations before visual defects began occuring. Even amongst the second generation children, it's radically improbable that in a population of, let's say, 1 million, with only 200 000 males, two children of opposite gender, of the same 1 man met and had sex. 

Animal husbandry (the act of using a small group of males to impregnate females) is used widely in the farming industry and the animal product is not damaged.

&gt;Not many communities are made up of a million people. 

...You must be joking. 

The world's population is 7 Billion. That's 700 millions. There are 249 countries. That means if you were to divide the world's population evenly, each country would have 2.8 million people. 

&gt;Iceland has about 300,000 people, and incest rates are so high they had to make an app that helps you not sleep with relatives (I'm not kidding). 

Iceland is a special case. A) They were conquered, raped and pillaged by Vikings, and B) no one moves to Iceland.

&gt;And they don't have the 80/20 scenario going on. If they did, incest would be unavoidable.

Everywhere have the 80/20 rule. 

&gt;I saw a guy today that I really found attractive. All I knew is that he was hot, and seemed very nice. I don't know if he's popular, rich, intelligent, or anything else.

You don't to know because it's a given...If he's ""hot"", he is obviously popular, and will more than likely be successful via his ""hot""ness. 

&gt;I'm not quite sure what you meant there, I think you forgot a word or something. But most guys who call themselves alpha males are huge douchebags.

I didn't miss anything....I'm saying you seem to believe an alpha male is a man that attacks women...an alpha male is a succesful, sexually desirable man. Mr HotNice guy you met today is probably an alpha male.

Paimon,spikes,1389549023.0,"&gt;You pick him over skyjek due to supposed increase in survivability, then defy your own logic by saying that Banisher Priest's fragility is ok

Skyjek and Halberdiers want to be played as soon as possible, rarely leaving mana open to react because of the time in the game that they are played. Priest on the other hand is a reactionary card that tends to be played later than turn 3, which will often mean leaving W open for Brave the Elements. Banisher Priest is the only main board answer to Desecration Demon or an active god. The fact that it also is able to trigger battalion is why it's in main rather than Chained.

Skyjek can't attack into 1 power on the ground or in the air, and a Banisher Priest is much more likely to eliminate the only opposing creature that can kill Halberdiers than Skyjek. Halberdiers is massively more survivable than Skyjek. In magical Christmas land one's opponents won't be trading or removing your creatures to keep you from getting battalion, and without Battalion, Haberdiers is clearly superior, and more likely to be able to attack effectively without battalion.

There five primary cards that can block Skyjeck after battalion, Judge's Familiar, Cloudfin Raptor, Nightveil Specter and Desecration Demon. The demon kills both, Halberdiers kills all of the others while the Skyjek trades with them.

&gt;Now onto Firemane Avenger. Also bad. There is a reason weenie decks top their curve at 3. The avenger doesn't do enough to justify it's cost. With your higher curve, most of the time you won't even get to trigger battallion with this guy, you don't have enough 1 and 2 drops. 

The whole point of the deck is that it has more reach than WW. That's why I run the full playset of Boros Charm, it's why I run Chandra and Firemane Avenger. It sacrifices some speed for this reach, while still being fast enough to race with other Aggro Decks. The three drops that this deck runs enable the four drops to be effective. Life gain and removal are the two things needed to blunt aggro. They also allow one to deal with the bigger threats that midrange throws at you. I've got both. Post board my removal suite is able to deal with any threat bar Aetherling, and with Firemane active I can essentially ignore crackbacks.

Edit: Also, Chandra can hit Boros Reckoner with her +1 and I won't lose Halberdiers while I would lose a Skyjek."

&gt;I don't call it fair when a women is simply expected to live their lives at home instead of being a co-breadwinner.

What about men being expected to be the breadwinner? What about the stigma of a SAHD (stay-at-home dad)?

&gt;And it's certainly not fair that a man can feel safe walking down a street at night, whereas a women can't.

Is it fair that a man walking alone at night is seen as a potential predator or rapist? Is it fair that a man who likes children or wants to work in a nursery is seen as a likely pedophile?

In college, we did this exercise where we examined ads in magazines to see what messages were being transmitted about women. But nobody thought to ask about the messages men receive. Are we all supposed to be tall, athletic, wealthy gentlemen with a chiseled jaw and a Mercedes? 

The point is that for every instance of sexism against women, you can find instances of sexism against men. So this is why the term ""gender equality"" has been gaining a lot of traction in recent years.

**On the subject of love**

* Eternal love doesn't exist. What we experience as ""love"" is merely a state of endorphine chemistry intended to keep us together until our offspring learn to walk. That's why most long-term relationships start to feel boring after about 3-4 years.

* [Women don't love you](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1qb7mi/she_doesnt_love_you/). They love how you make them feel.

* This means that women love opportunistically. If she's in a relationship with you, and some guy comes along who makes her feel even more intensely good, she will rationalize that she never truly loved you, and start making pans to jump ship.

* Women use a variety of tactics to test your fitness as a partner. Shit-testing is the most common of these tactics, and it manifests itself in the form of nagging, complaining, making demands, and starting drama with the intention of making you angry. If you remain unaffected by her tests, you win, and she remains attracted to you. If you get angry, defensive, or supplicate her in any way, her attraction for you goes down. Fail enough tests and she will begin to plan her escape.

**On the subject of equality**

* Men and women are physiologically and emotionally unequal. This precludes any possibility of their being made socially equal by passing laws.

* The morphological differences between men and women mean that men are naturally better suited to certain roles than women, and women are better suited to certain roles than men.

* Men, being physically stronger, more apt in abstract thinking, more capable of suppressing their emotions, and more driven to take risks, are better equipped and have more incentive to take up risky, difficult jobs, or to endure more stress.

* Women, being emotionally closer to children, having [fewer incentives to engage in risky behaviour](https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/03/21/the-fundamental-premise/), and generally considered more worthy of sympathy by society at large, are better suited to care-taking and social-oriented jobs such as teaching, nursing, public relations, human resource work, or being stay-at-home mothers.

* These differences are largely what account for the differences in male and female earnings.

**On the subject of social justice**

* Feminism has been a hoax since at least the early 1960s. Though it began as a movement fighting for fair treatment from men, it has turned into one demanding ""equality *with* men"", using the ambiguity of the term ""equality"" to weasel more and more personal benefit out of society's abundant sympathy for women.

* Whenever you try to point out a problem with feminism or with modern female attitudes, feminists will use a [variety of shaming tactics](https://exposingfeminism.wordpress.com/shaming-tactics/) to get you to accept their perspective.

* Most women don't WANT to be the equal of men. They don't like the stress or the hard work, because they're not suited for it. These women are happy to be submissive and servile if you can find a tactful way to reconcile their unfeminist desires with their need to appear like sisters of The Cause.

Point one was that workers cut corners, which leads to that becoming accepted and normal. 

Point two was that substandard training/equipment/whatever by the company and the lack of real consequences for said company lead to negligence as well. "

Sure, there are cases where people won't fact check a paper, but I would argue that if nobody checks the facts and conclusions then the paper doesn't matter.  Sort of like the one posted by OP.  It's a 20 year old paper about the advantages of a programming language, who cares if the facts are correct or not?

What's far more indicative of fraud is when the data supporting your paper is held back and kept secret rather than the source of funding.  Can you think of any examples where data was kept secret and then deleted rather than turned over by a freedom of information request?

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389549369.0,"Here's a small, personal anecdote that I feel illustrates your point . . . 

I was out at a club, just sitting and minding my own business. It was late, I was tired and I didn't really see anything I liked. 

This guy is dancing with his girl, and he keeps stumbling back into me even though there's lots of room on the dance floor that night. I try to give him the benefit of the doubt because the club is what it is, and you can't really complain about the occassional bump. 

It keeps happening even after I glared at him for doing it, so finally I just stiff arm him the fuck away from me hard enough that he moves about three feet and the chick gets bumped back a bit too.

He gets loud, mouthy, unglued, ""Blah balh you don't know what you're fuckin with"" whatver. I sit in my seat without saying a word to him while does all of this, quietly keeping eye contact. Eventually the bouncer comes over and moves the guy over to the other side of the dance floor.

Now, I'll confess, I rarely pass up a chance to tool a tool, so . . . the kid's still sitting there eyeing me from his seat. The girl didn't follow him over, and instead she starts talking to me. The bouncer is still watching him, so I decided to wink at the kid while talking to the girl and crack a cocky grin. Of course the kid tries to get past the bouncer who gives a big arm right in the chest to stop him. Needless to say, the grin got cockier after that.

The girl's one friend joins the conversation. As I'm sitting there, I see the chick to my right starts playing with her hair and her clothes, and she won't quit looking over my way.

So . . . yeah . . . I think based on the evidence that a very dead night quickly became three chicks showing IOIs simply because of a minor act of violence, there's something to be said for the idea.

Bear in mind, I grew up in a poor and violent environment. Hell, one of my next door neighbors stalked a guy after a fight at the bar, killed him, and then torched his body (sure, he got life in prison, but it seems like he made his point). It takes a lot more than some guy running his mouth to impress me, and when women pick that up, it's ""game on""."

I can understand this, but somehow I feel this is a bit unfair, that people with 2 losses can meet someone who hasn't lost yet is a bit stupid. I was at 1-2 with a deck that was really good, but I had really unfair matchups. If the matchmaking worked right, then I would meet people who had bad decks until I could move up a little, but no, I met someone with the craziest Warrior deck ever that would easily go 12-0.

I would easily take longer queue times to ensure fairer matches in arena. 9-0 definitely does not equal 10-2, and a 1-2 does definitely not equal a 0-0."

TheMarkHasBeenMade,AskWomen,1389549655.0,"My mom wasn't ever really emotionally there for me and she was a victim of child abuse growing up, so there was a lot of yelling in place of proper communication. Thankfully my dad WAS there emotionally so I didn't completely lack it but that has always stayed with me. I was a tomboy as a kid and that really frustrated my mom, she definitely favored my older brother and I got the short of the stick when it came to attention and patience. Her best way of expressing her love has been to buy us things so Christmas is always huge and she always buys bulk so we can have some. My aunt, cousins, and gramma always remarked that they didn't like how she treated me, but my mom is stubborn and has her mind made up about things, so she can't be told a thing if she doesn't wanna hear it. 

Because of all that I've grown wary of her attitude these days now that I'm moved out and on my own a few states away. She wants to be friendly and chatty with me, she wants to be completely welcome in my life and it irks me because of how she was when I was growing up. I know it's all in the past, but I have a very hard time letting her in so easily. We get along, don't get me wrong, but it still bothers me. "

&gt; Toute personne a droit Ã  la reconnaissance et Ã  l'exercice, en pleine Ã©galitÃ©, des droits et libertÃ©s de la personne, sans distinction, exclusion ou prÃ©fÃ©rence fondÃ©e sur la race, la couleur, le sexe, la grossesse, l'orientation sexuelle, l'Ã©tat civil, l'Ã¢ge sauf dans la mesure prÃ©vue par la loi, la religion, les convictions politiques, la langue, l'origine ethnique ou nationale, la condition sociale, le handicap ou l'utilisation d'un moyen pour pallier ce handicap.

&gt; Il y a discrimination lorsqu'une telle distinction, exclusion ou prÃ©fÃ©rence a pour effet de dÃ©truire ou de compromettre ce droit.

Ãa ne pourrais pas rÃ©ellement Ãªtre plus clair.

&gt; Tu as beau te boucher les oreilles, te fermer les yeux, etc. Le fait est qu'on ne permettra pas le retour du col romain et des cornettes dans la fonction publique.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1389549729.0,"It's a good start, but I think a lot of the people here are leading you to focus on texture and smooth transitions, when there's something much simpler that you should work on that would cause you to improve quite a bit more.

Above all, before all the smaller details and the careful rendering, this rock has a form. It has a multitude of faces, each being hit by the light at a different angle, causing that face to be lit with a different colour - though sometimes only subtly different. In this particular case, I count three major faces, and the angles are different enough to warrant significantly different tones. This, you have done successfully. So good job.

What's missing, however, is the sharp transitions. Where those faces meet, we are given slightly gradual moves from one to the next, giving the impression of rounded, softened edges. If it's a rock, chances are most (not necessarily all, but for now it may as well be) edges should be hard. This would give it a sense of weight within its environment, which is integral to what a rock ultimately is - a big, solid, heavy object. Good for bashing.

Instead, right now it looks somewhat more like fabric draped over a rock - for example, if you look at the point where all three faces come together, you've got this /\ shape that looks a lot like a crease in a sheet.

I did notice that you were trying to work in a bit of ambient lighting, putting the green on the lower faces of the rock, so kudos to you for that.

In summation: focus on getting the form down with clean edges. If you feel yourself adding detail purely because something isn't feeling right, step back and simplify. The more detail you add, the more you are likely to undermine the solidity of the object. Always be sure of the basic form of the object, and always adhere to it at every level of rendering.

Stronger bones, larger lungs and overall size, etc. (I don't think that's 'unfair' at all, and certainly no reason to prevent anyone from competing.)

Similarly, there will be developments that your body won't have grown up with, and that you won't get now with testosterone and the transition (that ship will have sailed in many ways as our bodies grow). So keep in mind that you shouldn't expect to be able to perform 'like a male' as you would had you been born male. But you should likely see improvements, particularly in strength and power--sprinting, say.

mrpoopistan,TheRedPill,1389549963.0,"I've read that article before and I'm a little iffy about it. Not because of what it says in TRP terms, but in terms of whether ""rape fantasy"" is really the right term.

First, the core female sexual fantasy is to be so desirable that an attractive man can't keep himself from wanting her. 

Second, there is a lot of shaming in our society toward dominant male sexual behavior, and especially toward the female desire to be the object of it. 

Third, all sexual fantasies are really, really overextended versions of reality. Every woman in male-oriented porn is skinny and yet has giant breasts. there's no reason to believe that female sexual fantasies -- which tend to be more generalized, less visualized, and more emotional -- wouldn't show a preference toward an overextended concept of male dominance.

My sense is that a lot of what are being called ""rape fantasies"" are actually fantasies about being irresistible. Women want that hot guy to be unable to stop himself from desiring her, and it's not surprising that their fantasies would center on extremely emotional forms of that need."

For some reason, society decided tall is better, but fuck them.

I have plenty of other things about my genetics that I hate. I have furrows on my forehead that are unsightly and I am only 20. I have a skin tone that is pinkish and makes me look sunburnt even when I'm not. My hair and eyes are brown, which is boring. I have terrible genetics as far as weight gain goes so I am at constant war with my weight. I am averagely endowed at best, which is more embarrassing because at my height it makes my penis look very small. I have only ever slept with one woman and she was too fat for me to 'put it in' so I'm kind of a virgin, in that i've had my dick in a vagina, but never had proper 'sex'. I have failed university twice with two different degrees and I barely have enough money to eat.

You will always have something about yourself you don't like. Everyone does, but sometimes I like to think along the lines of 'work with what you have' even if it's not much, it's all you got and it would be a waste to end it without experiencing all that you can, even if it's not everything that life has to offer.

Let her know that you think the wedding is stressing her out and that it won't hurt your feelings if she steps down and hope she does. The other option you have is to suck it up, stand by your choice, and involve her as little as possible. She shows up for dress shopping, fitting, and then for the wedding. That's it.

p3ndulum,PurplePillDebate,1389550190.0,"Well, what is the ""progress""?

These are all finite resources that are being used to feed an system of exponential growth.

The ""progress"", in that respect, is just an illusion.

Also, I've seen information that suggests that the wealthiest (of North Americans, at least) are, in fact, taking control of larger portions of the wealth that is available. I've also heard/read that more and more people (in the United States, at least) are relying more and more on things like food stamps and social assistance. It's also my understanding that consumer debt is growing (at least in North America).

brotherbock,running,1389550376.0,"&gt; But it's simple calories in versus calories burnt like normal.

One of the biggest myths of sports.

The 'calorie' is only a vague notion of energy in a food, or in our body, and we have only vague measurements of how people burn that energy. Changes in sunlight and in temperature can dramatically effect how our bodies store and use energy (like many other factors can). It is possible that OPs body is wired to burn energy *differently* in Winter months, say as a residual genetic advantage from ancestors living in colder climates, perhaps.

There is a *lot* more to exercise and weight loss than 'Calories In Calories Out' as a mantra.

(Not trying to attack you, dude. Just wanted to reply to this one point. The workout ideas, cross training and such, that you posted are great. But CICO, if we believe it's a magical formula, leads us to say, for example, when people can't lose weight ""you are likely not working out as much""--which may not be true at all. Hordes of personal trainers have made a lot of hard exercising overweight people feel like crap because ""if you're not losing weight, you're not doing what I said"", when in fact they *were* doing it.)"

Following the book's analysis, the Wiccan Rede is essentially a call to do the ultimate Will of the Goddess, to act as she would whenever possible, and that is with greatest love. To harm none is to avoid impeding the ultimate Will of another, to refrain from impeding their highest good. The book's author gives the example of stopping a recovering alcoholic from drinking. Though the person may be unhappy with you at the moment, it is for their best interest. The way I came to define evil is knowingly impeding someone's ultimate Will, in other words, their destiny.

Charter schools don't have unions so when they fire a teacher at the end of the year they are tactually letting the teacher go. Probably to either eliminate the position or hire a recent grad who will work for less. "

Just so that you have the proper background information about me, I am also a black male (although I must warn you that I am far younger than 30). I believe that I can (partially) relate to your experiences, although I cannot agree with the swooping generalizations that you make in this post.

According to your arguments, a black woman cannot be considered ""attractive"" unless she conforms entirely to white society, embraces traditional gender roles, and utilizes caustic chemicals to straighten her hair. Your sister is not at all in the wrong by refusing to make herself conventionally attractive; as this thread illustrates, the traditional ideal for beauty in this culture places an extreme focus on traits such as fair skin, straight hair, and light-colored eyes. Why would your sister want to subscribe to a Eurocentric model of attractiveness that *explicitly* devalues *her* phenotype (i.e. the typical physical features of most descendants of the African diaspora, such as dark skin, ""nappy"" hair, and brown/black eyes)?

I understand that everyone has personal preferences, but you are not really exhibiting an honest interest in analyzing the origins of your preferences. In my opinion, I think that you unconsciously derived these ideas about physical attractiveness/race from media/popular culture rather than from personal experience. However, this isn't necessarily an unusual case; according to a famous psychological experiment performed with dolls in the 1940s, the vast majority of US children (even black children) were quick to select white dolls as paragons of beauty and completely ignored the black dolls for consideration. It really is amazing to see how self-hatred/culturally-ingrained prejudice has affected the attitudes and behaviors of black society.

balathustrius,mead,1389550579.0,"&gt;If so, what's the purpose of the air lock?

Even during ""primary,"" I leave an airlock on my buckets or primary carboys because I ferment in my basement, and some nasty stuff can fall from the ceiling. In a cleaner environment, I'd probably rubber band some sanitized cheesecloth around the opening. I'm not sure it makes a difference. I mean, fermentation is starting and unless there is airflow there's just going to be a CO2 blanket on top. And if you're aerating, you're giving it a ton of air anyway.

Congratulations, it's *that* easy to reach the point where there's some discussion and disagreement in mead making practice.

I wouldn't bother doing any addidtional aeration with JAOM. It's not necessary. For a one gallon batch it's just too much work and risk (of accidentally creating a geyser and losing half the mead).

&gt;Also, cap management... Should I be worried about the fruit cap and push it down into the Must every so often as directed?

Yes. Use a sanitized something (I use a wine whip) to break up and push down the cap a couple of times a day once fermentation really picks up. Otherwise, you will likely have a sad mess. If you find that it's still pushing into the airlock, you have a few options. 

First, is to get a bigger vessel, but I reckon you've already started this and don't fancy getting more equipment or moving it, so consider this a long-term piece of advice. I use a 2 gallon bucket for 1 gallon batches and a 6.5 or 7.9 gallon bucket for 5 gallon batches. Second option is to use a blowoff tube - Google it. The third option is to remove the airlock and put it somewhere it can spill over. I put a sanitized paper towel or cheesecloth over it when I do that. If you go with the third option, keep an eye on it and replace the airlock as soon as the cap stops giving you trouble."

That not enough people voted them to actually represent in the national level but they were elected to represent in the EU level which is kinda awkward here.

&gt;You obviously know very little about this. Nigel Farage works or has worked with other Anti-EU parties in his group for the decade or so he's been elected there. He supports publicly nations such as Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy etc to have referendums on whether they want to leave and has argued repeatedly to the EU Parliament that he hopes it all breaks up

I don't read that much about them so you may be right. It's not enough clear though as UKIP always says things in UK interest and in fact in an opposite interest to other EU countries.

&gt;Publicity. More accurately, you could get employed and/or promoted into organisations that fund the Olympics and try to press for those organisations to defund them.
Is the notion of political parties getting elected into institutions they wish to disband or permanently change or merge that alien to you? It happens all the time.

We had previously never beaten Stoke in the Prem ever. So this is +3 points to last year. They also took points off *City, Everton &amp; 3 off Chelsea*. So we gained 2 and 3 points on them respectively in this fixture. 

Stoke are, believe it or not, a tough team to play. Especially at home. That's only their *second defeat at home* this season in the league. 

So, to be honest, while I did expect us to win on current form and goals, I would not necessarily have complained about a draw. Because it's not the fucking end of the world. We have a significantly easier 2nd half of the season (in terms of who we play at home) than our top 4 rivals and we would not have been 6, 7, 8 or 9 points adrift. "

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1389550844.0,"1. Paint has always scared me, because I didn't understand it. I sketched with graphite when I was younger, but gradually I shifted to working digitally from start to finish, especially over the past five years. More recently though, I picked up some gouache paint, and played around with it. It was a lot of fun, and definitely not as horrifying as I expected it to be, but ultimately all of my finished illustration work is still digital.
2. 99.9% Digital.
3. I drew on paper, mostly with pencils and coloured pencils since I was... I don't know, maybe eight years old. I didn't start working digitally until I was thirteen or fourteen. Got my first tablet (an old graphire 2 4x5) when I was fourteen years old. That said, I still never considered myself a traditional artist, and after I started working digitally, even pencil sketching started to disappear.
4. I think it's a difficult thing to compare. Contrary to what most people around here seem to say, I think that they are quite different, in that they serve different purposes. Digital is definitely the way to go for most professional illustration work (unless a client requests otherwise), simply due to its speed. In a field where working faster means taking on more work and therefore earning more money, it is extremely important. On the other hand, a digital piece on its own does not carry the same value as a traditional piece. It does not *exist* in the same way, and it's not something that can be sold as a single, unique item. You can print it off, but no matter what, it will not carry the same value as a belaboured oil painting, where each individual stroke can be seen layered atop the others. Even if technology one day can replicate digital paintings, stroke by stroke, the resulting canvas print still will not have the same connection to the artist, due to the printer-middleman. That is not to say that digital is a lesser medium - just that the results and best uses are different.
5. Nope.

7. Intuos5 Medium."

Starving_Kids,malefashionadvice,1389550932.0,"Hey, first off this is a solid post for advice asking. Good work on that.

Your strongest point right now is fit, which is very important and a good foundation for when you start getting nice clothes. However, a lot of your clothing isn't very good looking.

For starters, It looks like you have a lot of quarter-zips, which aren't very fashionable. It's almost always safer to go with a crew neck or V sweater. I'd say pretty much your entire sweater collection besides the gray cable-knit is pretty bad.

Your shirt collection is solid, except for the casual shirts. The chambray ones are nice, but the 2 brown checkered ones above them are really bad and you probably shouldn't wear them. It probably seems like you don't have much to work with, but trust me it's better to have a small but versatile wardrobe.

Only jacket that isn't very good is the element one in the middle, the peacoat is a good choice though.

You're right about shoes, they are the weakest point. Honestly, I wouldn't wear any of them but obviously you need shoes to walk and they're expensive. The only ones you shouldn't wear are the Converses, high tops are just really really immature looking. The boots second from the left are probably the best pair you have IMO. As for the sneakers, the blue nikes are really tacky but that grey and yellow pair is pretty sexy. As you start purchasing shoes, I'd say it would be most versatile for you to acquire a pair of cap-toe boots, a nice oxford, and maybe a pair of boat shoes or Van's for casual wear depending on your style.

Rule regarding it being a legal catch:
&gt;Rule 2.0 (Definitions):
&gt;A CATCH is the act of a fielder in getting secure possession in his hand or glove of
a ball in flight and firmly holding it; providing he does not use his cap, protector, pocket or
any other part of his uniform in getting possession

Rule regarding throwing your glove at a ball:
&gt;Rule 7.05 c)
&gt;Each runner including the batter-runner may, without liability to be put out,
advance three bases, if a fielder deliberately throws his glove at and touches a fair ball. The
ball is in play and the batter may advance to home base at his peril.

However, in the notes of rule 7.05:
&gt;Under (c-e) this penalty shall not be invoked against a fielder whose glove is carried off his
hand by the force of a batted or thrown ball, or when his glove flies off his hand as he makes an obvious effort to make a legitimate catch.

brotherbock,running,1389551134.0,"I would not agree. Fitness level, body temp, and a number of physiological factors can affect our basal metabolisms. All of us burn energy very differently as a result. And colder weather will, for example, reduce the temperature *increase* you get when working out. When you run outside in the cold, your body temp will not rise as high as when you run outside in warm weather. Your metabolism will therefore not rise as high during the very same workout, and thus you have less energy burnt.

Dehydration will also affect your metabolism, and there's a great study by the U of New Hampshire, I believe, that links cold weather to *increased* dehydration. We don't feel as thirsty when we are cold, so we don't drink as much. The air is also dryer in the cold, so we lose more through evaporation, as well as through breath.

Cold can have a significant effect on metabolism."

Zygomatico,NoStupidQuestions,1389551327.0,"There are several components, some of which have been mentioned before. The first is that he has the benefit of a large amount of money to invest, so he can diversify. By diversifying he can spread his risk without diluting his potential for profit. If you've got a thousand dollars to spend, you could buy 40 25-dollar stocks. However, you'll be hit with transaction fees, which are generally a fixed amount of money or, after a certain amount, a percentage of the transaction. So say that you have a 10 dollar transaction fee, you can only buy 28 different stocks. Then, if you want to sell them you're hit with the same transaction fee again, so you'll have to make at least 20 dollars on each investment, an average return of 80%. And that's assuming that each will make a profit. However, if you've got a million dollars and your transaction costs are 1% of the transaction you'll be able to buy those 40 stocks, at 25.000 each, only paying 250 dollars per transaction. This means that you'll have to make a 2% profit to win back what you lost in transaction fees. So, long story short, most investors do not have the money to spread their investments in a similar manner as Warren Buffet does. This also means that they'll be exposed to more risk, because the broader your portfolio the smaller your risk is.

Secondly, quite a few investors go for a quick buck. Warren Buffett, from what I've read on him, enlists the companies into his portfolio for the long term. He buys stock in them assuming he'll own them for a long time, so even if it'll make a loss one year, it's okay because he'll make a profit the next, or the year after. It seems he invests based on whether he trusts the owners to do a good job. This means that if you want to make money like him, you'll have to tie up your money in a similar manner, just playing the long game and waiting for the company to grow.

Finally, but I'm not too sure on the exact legislation: you don't have to reveal everything you do. For example, you don't have to state what percentage you own of a certain company, or sometimes if you own it at all. And if Warren Buffett buys a stake in a company, you might only learn of it through Berkshire Hathaway's financial statements, released quarterly. So it's less clear than you'd think, and it's quite hard to track what he's doing on the market.

TL;DR: You incur more costs and are less able to spread the risk. People generally don't invest for the long term and it's difficult to follow what WB does on the stock market."

exposure_therapy,AcademicPsychology,1389551579.0,"This is an example of self-selection bias. It doesn't necessarily make the study ""wildly inaccurate,"" but it is a limitation of *most* research using human-subjects. It's unethical to use someone as a research subject without their consent, so *every* study in the social sciences that involves self-report data (surveys, questionnaires, personality tests) also involves self-selection bias - there's no way around it.

The bigger issue here is that Reddit users aren't necessarily representative of the general population, or even the general ""student"" population - men, and students in STEM fields will likely be over-represented in this sample, so the results might not apply to women and/or humanities majors. 

There might be less bias if the researchers recruited in-person on a college campus - they could visit classes in different departments, so that they maximize their chances of recruiting a diverse sample. However, the trade-offs would be (a) less external validity, because the results might only apply only to students on that particular campus, or in that city/country, and (b) a much smaller sample (and therefore less statistical power) than they would get by recruiting online.

**tl;dr There are limitations to all research studies, but this doesn't make them bad studies. However, researcher need to weigh the pros and cons of the decisions they make, and address these limitations in their write-ups!**

And you know that if you give them an inch they are going to take a mile, so when you expand on what's there already - like adding an extra lane on a highway - people are just going to consume every bit of it - like how people flood that highway and just create bigger traffic jams.

mrangeloff,IAmA,1389551633.0,"The food is not expensive at all. Here is democracy and free market so the rivalry between different supermarket chains gives people some nice prices. 

The electricity is 50â¬/$70 monthly for two people in the winter. If you are a family of four, the bill is going at 100â¬/$150.

Rent is quite expensive because before the financial crisis in 2009 a lot of blocks and houses were built, but now they stay empty. Entrepreneurs want their money invested in the buildings NOW, so they set some high prices. And the buildings are still empty. I know it's wrong market model, but I don't know is there a branch in Bulgaria that has a right one for its needs. The price for a bedroom/living room+kitchen+bathroom starts from 150â¬/$200 at the worst neighborhoods. 

Gas is about 1.3â¬/$1.6 Ð° litre, so for a gallon multiply it by four.

So let's see how it goes:

Rent 150

Supplies (water+heat+electricity) 80

Food 150

Phone, internet, daily commute 50

We have about 400â¬/$500 for a single person to live normally in a big city. If you are living with a roommate or SO you go down to 250â¬/$300. The numbers are not that bad. But the fact that the average payment is 300â¬/$400 monthly...Yeah. The numbers don't add up. But Bulgarians manage to survive somehow."

I liked your modal soloing in ""The Golem"", reminded me of the style of soloing of Omar Rodriguez from Mars Volta. I like the cheeky sort of ""vamp"" that is running throughout the song. Has a nice ""bounce"" to it that got my head bobbing along with it. Overall so far I think what you are doing is really cool, and doesn't sound cheesy.

Elephant Gun seems more of a Riff oriented track which provides a nice change from the first two tracks with a solo appearing in the middle. I like the ""start/stop"" parts in the song, means it isn't full on with sound all the time which is nice. Kind of leaves you ""hanging"" waiting for it to drop back in again which is cool.

In regards to ""Gargoyles"" again, the classical progression is good to hear, and again the stop in the middle lends some dynamic variation to the song.

""Night I"" is a lot more atmospheric and very ""suspenseful"" (is that a word? it is now.) makes me think ""k wtf is going to come next?"". The quieter parts, again great dynamic contrast.

""Night II"" seems a lot grungier than the previous tracks with a kind of ""Alice In Chains"" sort of vibe really dark and gloomy.

Dinner is now ready so that's all I got time for for now. Great work though, really cool sound and compositions."

Sexy isn't easy.  Even when you've had experience, it's work.  You aren't going to be a stud your first time out, so relax.  We put a lot of pressure on ourselves to be these sex gods who make women come the second we touch them. 

That's not how it is.  My first time? I sucked.  My second time, I sucked.  luckily my partner was inexperienced as well.  Eventually I started dating a girl with a bit more experience. She took her time and showed me what she liked, and eventually I caught up.  I learned my strengths and weaknesses, and worked on both as long as it was in the woman's interest.

Just relax and allow yourself to suck, in a sense.  Try and nut before hand, and just breathe when the time comes. Practice kegel excercises and don't pressure yourself.  it can become a vicious spiral if you keep that going.  "

Before this storm system came in the mountain didn't have enough to even open the snowplay area (requires 60 inches of snow to go sledding at the Paradise side) and when I went up there in December I didn't really even need my snowshoes to walk on the (closed for the winter) Stevens Canyon Road. However, it really depends on how much snow the mountain gets throughout the rest of Winter.

I've been there Memorial day weekend one year and gotten snowed on. Gone there in early July and have had it still covered in snow during another year but then again, I've been there during another July and had the lower sections of the trail be bare. I try to go there at least 3-4 times a year. 

I'd plan on it having some snow. At least enough to want waterproof shoes and maybe a spare pair of socks. Don't forget sunscreen. Having the sun reflect off the snow and not having sunscreen will get you a super bad burn. However, like ryott228 said there should be a easily followed trail because I think it's one of the most popular trails at Paradise. 

The best way to get info on the trail conditions would be to talk to the rangers at the visitors center. When I've talked to them about trail conditions and trail recommendations they have been extremely helpful and friendly. "

feedmahfish,worldnews,1389551740.0,"That's not how it works.  

Territoriality is an evolutionary behavior that essentially can't work well in a preserve setting if the territory has an inconvenient range.  In other words, it seems that territoriality is problematic because the small population size would result in higher inbreeding if no other bulls are able to compete with a seasoned competitor.  Also, if the bull is non-reproductive, but still competiting with other bulls for territory, then reproductive success of other bulls goes down because females on the old bull's territory aren't getting access to the younger males. 

Thus, reproductive fitness actually decreases due to the restricted range and hogging of the females by the old male (there's only a finite amount of females here, the other bulls just can't go off and find a stray female in another unoccupied territory).

This was a good management decision and is MUCH more ecological stable.

&gt;The heartbreaking case of the girl who called 911
OR REALITY? HIDDEN URBAN LEGEND?

&gt;For two years recording circulating on the internet of a girl who called 911 in El Salvador for help because his mother by a man being killed. Facing the popularity of quasi morbid episode, entering the ranking of the most watched YouTube videos and commented, Salvadoran online newspaper El Faro, decided to move on their part and inquired if everything was a stark reality or a sham well produced. This is the story.


&gt;One day not conclusive December 2006 Zoila Cisneros, clerk 911 Salvadoran system, received emergency call I would make the life of Zoila stay marked forever.
Unfortunately, the training received by 911 operators of El Salvador is not very different from an operator of any call center, although there is an important difference: the software used by telephone operators of Pizza Hut is more advanced. Missing a few minutes to 9 in the morning, after the latest explanations of their work, Zoila sat in the cubicle number 4. The cubicle is just opposite to the command of the call center at that time occupied a place of Soaring name. Zoila sat, microphone and headphones are placed first and waited for the call that would serve on his first shift.


&gt;Zoila did not know that the recording of the first call circulated months later by Internet, mail in mail traveling between curiosity and indignation, at speed. She was sent in email chains, hung up on several blogs and dramatized with photomontages: only four Youtube videos in which the voice track is illustrated. He pressed the button to receive your headphones and listened to the broken voice of a girl sobbing on the phone:
 

&gt;Then the audio is transcribed verbatim. We recommend not play impressionable people.

&gt;Girl: Hello, good, please come to my house.

&gt;Zoila: Hello.

&gt;Girl: Hello, come to my house please.

&gt;Zoila: Give me the number

&gt;Girl: A man is fighting with my mom.

&gt;Zoila: Where do you live? No one adult who can help you?

&gt;Girl: No.

&gt;Zoila: Where?

&gt;Zoila: Wait, son.

&gt;Zoila: Oh, my God!

&gt;Girl: (shouts) Leave it, please! (Crying) Help me, help me!

&gt;Zoila: Ay! There's a kid pasting screams ...

&gt;Girl: Help me!

&gt;Zoila: Hello.

&gt;Girl: Is that my mom is fighting.

&gt;Zoila: So: where are you?

&gt;Girl: (Screaming and crying) No, no, no, noooo! They killed her, they killed her, they killed her! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! (Crying and screaming) Mommy, do not die, mommy! ... (Sounds like another child's voice: She was killed, killed Aunt, killed Crying!.

&gt;Zoila got the call and told his cubicle neighbor what he had heard and gestured minimizing this matter. ""You have to know that the kids fool you,"" he recommended. Seeing doubt therefore cubicle mate recommended it health and cure you comment on what happened after Soaring, the supervisor.

&gt;""I got up and went to tell the supervisor that he had just received a call and the child was screaming and I thought I wanted to help and I had the number and then he dialed the phone and answered a man, put the speaker to the headset and said: 'We received a call for help. "" The Lord told him that no, they had not called 911. The supervisor said, 'Why not, a child is saying that you are hitting Mum'. The other: 'No, here has been a little problem between brothers, but it's all over, children are outrageous. "" And then the supervisor hung ""recalls 
Zoila. 
&gt;After a week a system operator, snooping through the files looking for recordings that could be used for teaching purposes, heard that recording and rescued from oblivion, perhaps more than he imagined.

&gt;So that file circulated among the body of agents, passed from computer to computer, from memory to memory, until one time, nearly two years after the call, after a course of training police officers, a sergeant considered the Call warranted be shared with the public and the Internet rose.

&gt;What you heard was so atrocious that immediately began to appear many questions. 2006 was not a good year for the Police or to the security policy of President Saca. This year's record homicide beat and El Salvador led to violence across the continent. During the years that followed, the policy of ""tough"" was water everywhere. It was obvious that a call from a girl that you could not respond did little to improve the image of the PNC and also collaborated with the presidential campaign to come.
According to a staff of 911, the Division engaged Anti Homicide (Diho) and the Division of Criminal Investigation (DIC) to give the identity of the agent who had uploaded the file to the Internet. These investigated diligently until you find the thief whose identity jealously guard. After that, what to do with the call Simple: lie. Lying to whom he had to lie. Whatever happened, that call had not existed, it was false. And so it grew and grew curious wall of lies and silence.

&gt;Carlos Martinez, managed to get the word Light, mother of Clara, the supposed murdered woman.
""What I will tell you I have not told anyone, no one, not the police and you have to promise not going to have either."" Light begins and I promise to deliver the story burning inside. Clara was the fourth of his daughters, was 23 years and two children from different fathers: a girl aged 10 and a boy of 8. Clara slowly started walking the wrong path, away whole nights, then for several days and then just visiting his mother. He drank a lot and when he drank did not measure his words. That killed. One day he offended the woman who discovered sitting at the entrance of a store. It was a serious insult. Apparently Clara knew this woman some secrets, secrets that cost the life and Clara cried in public. The chick was a member of the gang and from that grievance was required to run blood to cleanse his honor. A few days later, she was collecting water in a cantarera and a stranger came up to talk to her. Two more types approached the boy and asked him to show them his naked torso. They were looking tattoos. Clara gang intervened and shot him. He was lying on the floor with four bullets in his body, blood and dirty ground. ""Like a sugar pie,"" recalls Luz, his mother. This is all that can be said of the death of Clara without jeopardizing the rest of his family. Light decided not to talk, do not trust anyone. The place where it happened is one of the so many communities that remain among Ticsa and Altavista.

&gt;But the story does not add up. Four times at close range do not give room for anyone to call 911. None of the children of Clara was home at the time and have been none of which had a cell call. Furthermore, not killed Clara at 9 am. A few days after the murder of his daughter, a researcher at the Police arrived at his house commenting something about a 911 call made ââby a minor. A light just cared that this man is out, so I told him the truth: I know nothing about any call from any child. Case closed. No policeman has ever gone to get home Light.
Karla Varela, public policy specialist of Unicef, was shocked last year when someone sent him the recording that was already circulating on the Internet. He decided to do something and allowed him to explore his contacts at the highest level. She came as a UN official to former Public Security Minister Rene Figueroa, who asked about the veracity of the call and Figueroa promised to investigate.

&gt;Days later, Varela Unicef ââand other officials met again with the security minister who had them a reassuring story: it was a false alarm. A well-orchestrated lie. ""An urban legend,"" were his words. By now know about the veracity of the call, at least one telephone operator, one of his companions, his supervisor, the group support system, an amateur internet sergeant, several groups of officers who used the call to teaching courses, several agents who received these courses, a group of officers who, according to Zoila, the operator-gathered to evaluate your case ... and Commissioner Jose Luis Tobar Prieto, Director General of Police. But RenÃ© Figueroa, his polite smile, assured the United Nations Fund for Children that it was an urban legend, a myth.

&gt;The first time I spoke with Gersan Perez, head of the system 911, the President was even Antonio Saca and police chief Tobar Prieto. Was a week that the new authorities assume their office and the issue seemed Gersan be uncomfortable. He recommended that I speak with the communications unit and told the journey he had expected me to avail myself of the information that the unit had provided me. ""The director has explicitly asked us not to talk about that topic. I promise I'll talk, but then wait for me on Monday. "" On Monday he was referring to was on June 1, the day that the Saca administration handed power.

&gt;Days later, sitting in his office, Gersan explained the reason for the silence: neither the police nor the prosecution had never been able to locate the origin of the call. Partly because Zoila never generated ""event"" in the police slang meaning that in the rudimentary computer system of the Police, the receptionist never appropriated the date and time of the call, so that, after the years, these data shipwreck-perhaps forever-in memory of the PNC. Although it was the first day of work at Zoila cabin, and the first call she received, she does not remember the exact date. And there are no records. The system also automatically archives the phone from which the call originates and this is displayed by the receptionist just the time it takes the call, and any phone. If this is not scored by hand, the number also cease to exist. In the call, the girl who denounces the death of his mother is a two-digit cell number pronounce talking when Zoila interrupts. Never gave police the case and instead assume decided silence or simply lying. ""Of course the police affected by the same wear this has generated,"" said Gersan.
In a country where the average was 9.5 murders per day in the last five years, it is not difficult to find a body to match the spatial location between Ticsa and Altavista. Another body to which, incidentally, has not done him justice. Only in Ilopango, in 2006 15 women died. The age range in which death claimed garments ranging from less than one year to 54 years old.
At the height of urban legends, sometimes actually exceeded.

Nintendo's best bet for a strong system seller will be their Zelda title. Still, though, I don't see Wii U breaking out of a distant third place spot, but I do think it will be financially successful if only on a minor scale and I don't think Nintendo's going anywhere. I will say I think there'll be more people by the end of the gen owning a PS4 and a Wii U or an Xbox One and a Wii U than a PS4 and an Xbox One, because on a first-party-titles-alone basis Nintendo has the strongest line-up; God of War, Uncharted, Gears of War and Forza are no Mario or Zelda.

Ralkir,changemyview,1389551946.0,"&gt; but all that is guesswork- we don't know what the testosterone levels of our ancestors were and I'll bet that we will never find out. And what does testosterone have to do with memory, perception, and language in this case?

We don't need to know what our ancestors had, we are immensely similar to our ancestors so we can study ourselves. Yes we are constantly evolving but evolution (especially for large animals, with long life spans) happens over a long period of time. We are essentially the same as the first homo-sapians. 

And I already demonstrated perception for you. One of the studies I read earlier when I was having this discussion with someone else was that testosterone mitigated a person's ability to recognize anger or threatening faces and body language. What does this mean from an evolutionary sense? Well typically people with large amounts of testosterone are bigger (for lack of a better term I'll call them alphas, and I'll stick exclusively to males). So we have this big alpha males with a decreased level to recognize when someone is getting pissed off. What does this do for them? Well it allows them to be the leaders, to be that alpha, because they don't back down when challenged because they don't even recognize they are being challenged in the first place, they just continue to assert themselves, take what they want and pass on their genes. 

Now what does this do for the men with lower amounts of testosterone (for lack of a better term, the betas). Well they have a lower amount, so this INCREASES their ability to recognize threats and aggressive behaviour. So if someone who is bigger than them is assuming a threatening stance, they can recognize it and avoid a confrontation that will most likely keep them alive and thus able to reproduce.

Testosterone in this case, works on the the ability to PERCEIVE threatening behaviour. "

I've done a ton of work to get myself in the mood on a regular basis, but it's still work, and sometimes I don't have it in me -- for example, while pregnant (except in the second trimester, last time) or after having a baby and while breastfeeding.

Right now, I'm a month postpartum and scared to have sex even after the six week mark. I'm pretty sure it's still going to hurt then. And though I'm certain it won't take as long to get my willingness back after this kid, for various reasons including experience and considerably less damage to my lady bits this time, I still expect it'll be more ""okay it's been too long, I'll look at some porn so I can get out of the anti-sex mood"" and not so much my usual ""it's been a while, it'd be nice to have sex, I'll get myself in the mood."" I probably won't get that back until I'm done breastfeeding our son.

I should say that our marriage is not sexless on the whole. It has ups and downs; right now it's down, but my husband and I both know it'll go back up again.

The person with the condition strongly, biologically views themselves as the opposite sex/gender. No amount of counseling or therapy resolves that. Or, if it seems to, it's only because it's forced the individual to temporarily suppress their feelings. So, instead of viewing it as a choice or the product of a damaged mind, it makes more sense (and treats the individual with more respect) to correct the physical abnormality. Doing so enhances their quality of life immensely. It's almost beyond measure. They can be who they feel they are and have a chance at a good, functional life.

After transformation, the problem isn't with them. It's with society at large and whether or not they chose to be accepting. That's the only real choice in the matter.

Managers and ecologists work hand in hand with hunters because they observe our animal stocks much more often than we ever could on any grant.  They also tell us if our management is not working.  We need hunters to protect species.  Plain and simple.  Nature kills animals every damn day.  We are a part of nature even if we don't want to believe that.  That means we have to be a part of the killing mechanism in a way that efficiently sustains the population.  That actually means culling them.

Otherwise, you get deer overrun, turkey floods, flying squads of carp, and other nuisances.  Animals have the right to live, but we have the responsibility to make sure that ALL animals can live according to the natural processes."

The rules in this case, as the question directly refers to ""you,"" would be your personal morality scale developed over the course of your life.  Fairness is not objective, and every person is entitled, if not expected, to have their own idea of what fairness is.  So in this case, fairness is really whatever you want it to mean.  Some people think corporal punishment is fair, others don't.  Neither are necessarily wrong.

I'm against Israel's occupation and gradual annexation of Palestine, but I consider that supporting Israel. I don't think that policy is good for Israel. It endangers Israel, isolates it, strengthens its own tendencies toward militarism and reaction while also strengthening xenophobic tendencies in its neighbors.

Plate armor isn't *just* plate armor.

You have silk underclothes, then a quilted layer of linen (or more silk) and cotton that may be reinforced in places with leather. Then over that are a few pieces of chain mail - coif, shirt, leggings - and finally around and over that, goes the plate.

This is a *huge, huge, huge* simplification of the matter, and there isn't full overlap everywhere, but in full plate a person has a good chance of taking arrow hits unscathed.

Cygnus_X,BitcoinMarkets,1389552444.0,"All it ever takes is one piece of government regulation to destroy the value of something.  I realize this is a possible scenario Bitcoin, but it is also possible with many things.  I am betting a total ban on Bitcoin is not carried out in the US nor will it be carried out in many Euro nations.  Yes, that is an assumption, but it is what I believe.  I also believe many small business owners will elect to retain profit in the form of BTC from BTC payments.  Even if employee paychecks cannot be in BTC, land lords and other small business owners will still save up BTC from their transactions.  And it makes sense, to me, as the dollar devalues by roughly 2-3% year after year.  

People always put a lot of emphasis on the volatility of BTC.  What kept the USD stable in price when it was locked to the gold standard?  And if it wasn't stable, how did the economy still do so well in the 20's?  The trade off for perceived stability for the cost of devaluation just doesn't add up for me.  The issue you bring up with gold has many negative implications when it comes to storage and transportation.  If gold could be moved and stored as easily as BTC, I'm sure many people would still elect to receive payment in Gold.

Anyways, I can foresee a future in which a small, but significant percentage of the world's population elects to live entirely off a form of crypto-currency.  Maybe it's Bitcoin, and maybe it's something else.  But as more and more merchants accept BTC payment, this will become a trendy thing to do.

ajustin118,relationship_advice,1389552612.0,"&gt; You're right, she was my only source of emotional intimacy - which I thought she fucking understood. I'm not just looking for a friend here is what **I was subtly telling her from the get go.'**

This is why you're a phony, you were trying to convey your interest in a way that wouldn't allow her to reject you. This maneuver reeks of insecurity and neediness. That's not the way the world works. You have be willing to risk rejection.

&gt; I think that if I was only lusting after her, I'd be fantasizing about fucking her all the time, which I don't. I fantasize about being open with her, helping her with her issues, and experiencing a real relationship with her, including sex.

Emotional/Romantic fantasies are very common for men who are sexually inexperienced. For example: 
&gt; I was 21 when I lost my virginity (I'm 23 now). Before I lost it, I kept on beating myself up about it.
&gt; 
&gt; I was horny, **but I didn't really crave sex as much as mere companionship. Sex was an abstract concept to me, companionship was much more concrete. I thought I could envision what a relationship was supposed to be like so I clung to that fantasy.**
&gt; Looking back, I realize now that having that fantasy in my mind was super unhealthy. It also made me very unattractive to women because I'd behave in a feminine way that didn't align with their expectations.
&gt; 
&gt;**I would try to pursue a relationship before having sex because sexual situations made me feel vulnerable. More than anything, I wanted to find a girl that I could feel comfortable sharing myself with. It sounds like a good idea in theory, but in practice it was a huge turn off for women because I reeked of neediness.**
&gt; 
&gt; I NEEDED a girl to make me feel comfortable. I NEEDED a girl to tell me that being a virgin was okay. I NEEDED a girl to be patient with me. I NEEDED a girl to be non-judgmental.
&gt; Ultimately, I started experiencing success with women when I became more assertive about I wanted and assumed a more ""stereotypically masculine"" role in dating/sexual situations. I had to learn how to laugh at my mistakes and how to be comfortable in uncomfortable situations. I had to learn how to be non-reactive even if I thought a girl was judging me or rejecting me.

Make no mistake what you are feeling is lust.

&gt; If she wasn't attracted to me then why did she always say I looked good, or gaze at me when I was focused on something, or give me those looks whenever something unexpectedly sexual came to our attention?

She gave you just enough validation/affection to keep you hanging around. Just enough to keep thirsting for more.

&gt; If she doesn't respect me then why did she have so much empathy for me, and why did she always hear me out without judgement whenever I had something to say? Including the times that I told her my feelings about her.

No, she didn't. She only heard you out when it was something she didn't mind hearing. When you were finally honest with her. She pretended like she forgot what you said."

I do not get off on correcting people, but I believe communication should be as unambiguous as possible. Myself included.

If I've been wrong I will admit it.

Adultery and alcoholic addiction/substance abuse are not Tantrayana. 

&gt;&gt; Why was she upset when she found out? Why did she cry? 

&gt;Because she was raised in a western society where monogamous love is the norm.  She may still not have it in her vocabulary, but she could have just decided to pack it up and go and move on.  **Why didn't she leave?**  She must have seen continued benefit in staying with him. Of course you can go cynical, but if she milked him for all he had he was none the wiser, as *he* trusted her basic goodness, and vice-versa.  Reading Dragon Thunder I got that.  For the record Shambhala Publications has yet to receive any money from me.

Lol what? You are blaming her for her feelings of betrayal by trying to twist poly positions to justify cheating. **He vowed to be in a monogamous marriage and she trusted him. He then proceeded to break those vows**. Being poly isn't vowing to be monogamous then not getting consent from your partner to open the relationship. Whether to leave or stay with a cheating partner is a personal decision, and that doesn't change the fact that he was a *lying adulterer*. And then you try to imply she was a gold-digger? Seriously? 

&gt;&gt;And it's unethical to sleep with students put specifically under his spiritual charge.  

&gt;Tell that to the Triratna Order, or all the Zen Priests that have also come out in scandal?  

I would.

&gt;&gt;his tradition. Not Buddhism.  

&gt;Tell that to all the ""legitimate"" teachers who still refer to his teachings.  I am listening to Khandro Rinpoche who refers to him in the talk, and I think has the same blunt, uncomfortable, squirm in your seat style as Trungpa did.  Is she somehow *not* legitimate?  

Is she a lying adulterer too? Then no she's not. Buddhism is more than what you write on paper.

&gt;If you can tell me one person who could so eloquently cover so many areas as succinctly as he did, then I'll look that person up.

There's more than one person, there are many, starting with the Buddha himself. Do you really think Buddhism in the west rests in the hands of one man? Do you really think we can't go without him? Buddhists who haven't read his materials are doing just fine.

He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement would troubled him greatly, since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy.

As for Pompey.../u/Tiako makes a good point in that he looks *very* similar to the later busts of Pompey. I'll still grumble at that though, because Pompey was *super* vain - Throughout his life, he seemed to adore attention (Goldsworthy actually notes that that might be why he loved Julia so much - because she adored him. Yes, I know that sounds silly when I say it :P), as emphasized by [this statue he posed for in his youth.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/PompeoMagno.jpg) (**WARNING** - Naked statue) While I'll certainly agree that he had a round face....I dunno if I'd put him the way he was portrayed in *Rome.* Y'know?

However, regarding gladiators - they weren't ""flabby."" They were *extremely* fit, but they layered on a bit of fat to act as a shield - best way I could describe it would be to say that they were ""big."" You know, sort of how a linebacker is ""big."" They wouldn't exactly be flabby ;) Though, to be fair, that word's a bit confusing as is...plus I'm totally saying it too much :P

On legionaries...I'd like to see your source on them being even slightly fat. With the amount of work their generals (Lookin' at you, Caesar) put them through, it seems *highly* unlikely that they would be fat at all. "

HumanSockPuppet,40krpg,1389553504.0,"Well, look at it this way:

In the 40K fluff, [Primarch Sanguinius](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Sanguinius) of the Blood Angels engaged the Bloodthirster Ka'Bhanda in single combat multiple times, and gave the Greater Daemon a run for his money.

The Deathwatch book Mark of the Xenos contains stats for a run-of-the-mill Bloodthirster. 

So, buff the stats of the MotX Bloodthirster and tilt his Talents and Traits toward the divine and sanctified, and you've probably got yourself something approaching a Primarch in terms of power.

Now, as for the Custodes. They're supposed to the Space Marines what the Space Marines are to normal men. Custodes are the Emperor's Praetorian Guard. They are tasked with patrolling the Imperial Palace on Terra, and a mere 300, refered to as The Companions, are tasked with serving at the Emperor's personal bodyguards.

I'd wager that a guard of the Adeptus Custodes would be somewhere between a Primarch and the Space Marine, though closer to a Space Marine in terms of actual power.

I'm an amateur game designer, so I could probably work out actual stats for a Custodes, if you really want."

The highlight:

&gt;Once upon a time, three groups of subjects were asked how much they would pay to save 2000 / 20000 / 200000 migrating birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups respectively answered $80, $78, and $88 [1]. This is scope insensitivity or scope neglect: the number of birds saved - the scope of the altruistic action - had little effect on willingness to pay.

&gt;Similar experiments showed that Toronto residents would pay little more to clean up all polluted lakes in Ontario than polluted lakes in a particular region of Ontario [2], or that residents of four western US states would pay only 28% more to protect all 57 wilderness areas in those states than to protect a single area [3]."

I wasn't expecting him to do this, and I wasn't opposed to moving near him although he assumed I was. I begged him not to end the relationship. For an embarrassingly long time I became a stereotypical obsessive ex desperately trying to get him to change his mind. 

In hindsight, I realize that if I had just reacted calmly and left him alone, we'd have ended on good terms and there'd be a chance of an amicable reconciliation sometime in the future if we ever end up crossing paths.

I cringed when I read how you asked that girl to prom.  ""A"" for effort but that stuff is for the movies.   

Others have said it and it's true, girls dig confidence.  
Don't misread that; confidence isn't cockiness or arrogance.   

Confidence is the feeling that no matter what happens everything is going to work out just fine.   This is what people mean when they say you need to pretend you don't care.  
Keep asking yourself, ""what's the worst that could happen?""  
Example:
Right now you don't have a date coming up.  If you ask out a girl you will either have a date or your won't.  Worst case is you are right where you were, best case Date!  

My other example is this, back when I was in college my best friend from HS went to different Uni.  He started going to the strip club on Friday nights.  I preferred going to the bar.  
I came to this realization.  On any given Friday we would both go out.  We would both spend about the same amount of $$.  At the end of the night he would go home and watch porn and masturbate.  3 out of 4 times I would go home, watch porn and masturbate.  Ahhh but that 1/4 times, I would make out, get a date, or even get laid.  
The difference was that I was risking rejection and he wasn't.  The result was that I got dates and action and he got a VIP card to a seedy strip club.  

How to get a date:  
I wouldn't ask out customers while you are working.  
See a girl you might be interested in.   
Walk up and start talking.  About what?  Whatever she is doing right then.  Ask non-threatening questions.  
In line at Starbucks,  ""I heard you order a ___, I've never had that, what's it taste like?""  Don't ask a yes/no question.  
In a department store, ""excuse me, I'm trying to find a gift for my (mom or sister), I think she might like something like (whatever the girl is looking at), maybe you could help me, how can I tell if it's the right size or style for her?""  

Ok that first conversation went well enough that you want get to know her better.  Make eye contact and say:
""Thanks for ___, It's been great to meet you and I think we should hang out again soon.  Like, coffee... tomorrow.   I'll meet you at (a place and a time, BE SPECIFIC), my treat.  Oh and I better get your number just in case...""  
Once she gives you her number, call her while you are standing there and say, ""there now you have my number too.""  This prevents a false number and getting stood up.    

Coffee (or ice cream in the summer) are good first dates.  If they totally suck, you're only out a few bucks and they only last about 30 minutes.  On the other hand because they are short there is less pressure.  They can go on all afternoon if things are going well.  
Don't make your goal getting laid or a GF.  Make it your goal to meet new people and make new friends.  

TLDR; It's no big deal, don't over think it.  ""You, you're hot, let's get to know each other over coffee... that wasn't a question.  You, me, coffee, conversation, my treat.""  *Smile and offer your arm* ""Let's go."""

&gt; The court stated that official police personnel and the government employing them owe no duty to victims of criminal acts and thus are not liable for a failure to provide adequate police protection unless a special relationship exists.

Trautman   v.  City of Stamford

A man was struck on the sidewalk by cars drag racing. Police took no action to stop the races.

The judge ruled that even though Trautman was a part of the public the police still owed no duty to protect him.

Trujillo   v.   City of AlÂ­ buquerque

Judge ruled no special duty to protect a young man from violence in a city   park.

For special duty to occur you need 2 things.

There must be some form of privity, between the victim and the police department and the victim, that sets the victim apart from the general public.

Second there must be specific assurances of protection to the victim.

However, dispatchers are allowed to lie about assuring protection. 

Police have to directly say they'll protect you **and** you must have relationship based on privity.

The most successful cases in suing for police inaction are business owners that were guaranteed protection during riots and **were told not to defend themselves.** 

*Bloom v. City of New York*

*tl;dr* Police have to say they'll protect someone and that person must be an important party to the police. Shops, malls, organizations, etc.

If you don't know about something then don't try and use it as an argument and certainly don't accuse someone of being a dick when they point out the fact they don't know what they are talking about.

I hope your attitude to science of logic  irl isnt as sloppy as it is to addressing this topic .


I personally find you a  dick because you think you are some kind of sole arbiter who can diagnose ""Inferiority complex"" from a handful of words which all have merit and address a specific point. red flags should fly to anyone who uses phrases such as

""This strongly indicates interiority complex.""

Wool can smell like that if it gets wet and doesn't dry enough.

I've also had to deal with a similar but opposite problem. In high school I worked at a Taco Bell so my work clothes smelled after a shift and I didn't want my other clothes to smell like them. 

First, I wouldn't wear my work uniform on the way to work or on the way home after a shift. I'd wear ""regular"" clothes and have my uniform tied in a plastic grocery bag. When I changed into it, my regular clothes would get tied in the bag so the Taco Bell smell wouldn't get into my clothes. After work, I'd change and put my uniform in the bag and tie it up. 

I'd also wash my uniform before a shift so I'd have a clean uniform to wear and throw about 1/4 c of white vinegar in the wash.

Letters all have personalities and usually with colors to match along with certain textures in my head. While numbers are mostly just sharp, shiny, flat, and their colors. While some numbers interact, most do not unlike the alphabet where every letter has a relationship with one or more of the other letters. 

For example, (I said this a little earlier but it's the first couple I usually think of.) A is a male, he is a bright red with a shiny gloss and flat. A's best friend is B who is a dark navy blue, rounded and kinda soft. They're best friends, always have been because they ""live"" so close together. C is a female banana yellow that is super friendly and is pretty good friends with A and B. C is friends with D, who is a male brownish-green color and has some weird quirks to his personality. He's shy so when C brings D to hang with A and B they don't understand him. And as I said Q is my favorite because she is this beautiful emerald green and she's badass and smart and just a really strong woman. U is of course her friend and they go everywhere together usually but U sometimes annoys Q. U is this quirky bright bright magenta color (almost neon but even though they're different they're really good friends.

Numbers are different. They're very mathematical (obviously) so they don't really have personalities and most are shiny, hard, sharp edges and most are serious with very little to no relationships. Take 7 for example. He is almost the same color as Q but a lighter shade. He has very sharp edges and is shiny. Most are like that with a few exemptions.

Words are like the alphabet but they don't come quite as detailed. They have colors but that's it.

I've recently been discovering more and more layers to my form of synesthesia. When I was little I can remember knowing each personality and each color for everything but as I've gotten older and haven't paid much attention to my thoughts as closely they started to become fuzzy. The more I think about it the more I know. It's like finding myself all over again.

TL;DR Every letter of the alphabet had a personality, color, shape, texture, and a relationship to another letter. Numbers are all business and usually flat, sharp, and shiny. Words are more difficult as they are a bunch of letters but for right now only have colors.

Edit: totally forgot you asked me about upper and lowercase letters. I'll use Q &amp; q as an example again. Lowercase q is a pastel green color and soft like a rabbit but not furry like one. She is the niece to Q and wants to be like her but is a preteen (maybe 11 or 12 years old) while Q is in her 30s. All letters are related to their lowercase counterpart in some way. Some are the children of them, some nieces of nephews, and some siblings."

http://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/local-news/a3-ghost-crash-remembered-10-4807754

The basic story is some drivers saw a car with bright headlights drive off the edge of a slipway into a hedge, only when the police turned up there was no sign of a crash. On further investigation, they found a rusty, old crash with a skeleton nearby of a youth who had been on the run from the law and apparently crashed and died 5 months earlier."

The ENT he finally saw said ""well we can try a different antibiotic or remove them"". 

He decided to remove them and right after the surgery, the ENT came out to tell me he was recovering/surgery went great and said it was a good decision based on how his tonsils were when she saw what shape they were in.

I worked downtown and I would give him rides home now and then if he asked for one. 

I'd met quite a bit of 'homeless' people this way. Since I was friends with one of their spanging buddies most of these homeless people were more honest and natural around me than they were around regular people. One of the most common things these guys and girls liked to talk about (other than their various vices, sex partners, or people they've taken advantage of the most) was about the creative ways they used in order to sneak into someones house and squat for an indeterminate amount of time, even if they actually had a home to go to.

If you apply human morals and how we deal with one another to everything, you create a larger mess than what you started with.

Humans are humans. Animals are animals. I'm not saying we shouldn't treat animals properly, but there is a line. Killing it  when it isn't breeding and is aggressive to raise money to help preserve the rest of it's species is beneficial. Though you can see it how you'd like. "

feedmahfish,worldnews,1389554675.0,"Sorry bro, you're not winning brownie points.  This is not a contradiction.

Animals have the right to live.  We have laws that regulate ""wanton waste"".  That means killing a regulated animal for the fuck of it and leaving it there for the buzzards.  You're not allowed to do that.  Why?  Because it's a bit amoral to do that.  That's what's meant by it.

However, the laws are in place so that we are allowed to kill animals.  You'd think that a contradiction, but we've done so since the dawn of time, we eat meat (which implies we kill animals), and just because modern times have new thoughts, it doesn't excuse us for the fact WE ARE ANIMALS AND WE ARE STILL PART OF THIS PLANET'S NATURAL PROCESSES NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO HIDE BEHIND YOUR COMPUTER.

Thus, we are ethically justified in killing animals.  We just need to do so in a way that fits in with the natural processes.  Including culling deer, hog, carp, turkey, and other animals that are clearly running amok.  Their huge population boom is not part of the natural process because we've historically destroyed it.  Thus, we need to be part of the repair mechanism.  That means being the agent that kills those species.

The advanced weaponry makes our role easier.  The advanced weaponry makes precision killing and counting much easier.  The advanced weaponry is what makes management today work.  And it's great if it's fun.  More people will do it.  We have better numbers.  We have more control.  We have more money.

For reference, B6 (well, B Complex) didn't lengthen my LP at all. I was O-ing between CD19 and 21 for those cycles, but my LP remained 8-9 days.

how do you not understand this? if someone makes an argument using a  subject matter they know nothing about, confirming it as invalid by confirming they dont know what they are talking about IS ACTUALLY RELEVANT!!! (youll notice the comment then goes on to explain why)

&gt;Thus continuing an obvious trend you started early on, no? I notice you have no retort other than to try to call foul on a technicality (we had ground rules established?).

The fact you think its a technicality is depressing, are you really that stupid that you think if someone asks you to justify your conclusion to a post that comments after the post are relevant, its basic logic 101, the fact you think its a technicality is really quite tragic

To be perfectly honest i actually think you are not very intelligent at all, in fact so much so, i dont see any point walking you through what is actually pretty basic logic. All your responses have huge logical flaws in them (such as the ""Tehcnicality) and the fact you routinely make these mistakes calls into question your capabilities.

Patriots got, in exchange, the Jets' 5th rounder in 2001, 7th rounder in 2002, and Bill Belichick.

The Patriots' first rounder eventually found its way to the 49ers, who used it for Julian Peterson (the Jets still retained four first-round picks in 2000).   With the other draft picks from the Patriots, the Jets got Jamie Henderson and James Reed.

YOUR_VERY_STUPID,lewronggeneration,1389554943.0,"In defense of 4'33:

It's a piece that's not just supposed to be pure silence- it's supposed to be the sounds of whatever's going on around you. The rustle of a concert hall, perhaps faint footsteps in the background. Maybe a baby wails or something.

It's easy to say ""fuck avant-garde art, it's pretentious."" People have been saying this for a really long time, though- even about art that's well-accepted as legitimate now. For example, a lot of people hated impressionism when it was becoming popular.

It's totally possible to make easy minimalist art like, say, a song with no notes or a painting that's entirely one color. You could do this with no intended meaning to convey, just doing it to appear deep and subtle. But just because this appears so easy doesn't mean that everyone does it.

Just because it's simple to have a piece that's pure silence doesn't mean the author was constrained by laziness. I believe that Cage absolutely had a vision- he's done so much with music that's not just lazy ""if you don't like it you don't understand it"" stuff. He was apparently studying Zen Buddhism at the time and 4'33 was influenced by that.

Cage had the idea that any sounds can be music, and he really messed around with that a lot- some of his work (especially 4'33) is very much hit-or-miss, but trying new things to see if they work is a cornerstone of the evolution of every kind of art. Even if it's not your thing, it's still an important piece in the development of music-as-art."

Scenario A: A young girl is dying of cancer. In a church of 100 people, only 50 people pray for her. Is that more powerful than if 51 people prayed? Would it matter to God if 1 person or 100 people prayed? Is prayer likely to have anything to do with the outcome? I'm not talking about 'Does God exist/have the power to heal', but from a Christian standpoint where you already believe in the power of prayer etc, does it really matter whether we pray or not because God is sovereign and already knows/has already decided whether the girl is going to get better by medicine or succumb to her illness? We came to the same result, that it's still important to pray because God likes to hear our prayers. "

ctesibius,AcademicBiblical,1389555073.0,"&gt; You're creating ad hoc hypotheses without any support for them

No. I'm stating that you are applying a double standard to interpretation. If a historian were to take an Egyptian document, say the account of the Battle of Kadesh, he or she would not start by interpreting it as an absolutely accurate account of the events, then throw it out as fiction when it was found not be to literally true in all respects. Most historical documents reflect a point of view, are selective in their reporting, and contain deliberate or accidental distortions. I assume you agree that this is beyond argument?

&gt; The Israelites didn't even exist yet during the alleged time of their bondage in Egypt.

The Exodus account does not contain an ""alleged time"", not does it appear to refer to a period of 400 years (I'm referring here to the last chapter of Genesis and the first of Exodus, which cover this period - perhaps you have a different source in mind. I've already covered the question of numbers.

&gt; 38 of their 40 years

40 (whether 40 years or 40 days) is usually taken to be figurative.

&gt; Finkelstein

While worth reading, I am afraid that I cannot agree with your assessment of ""canonical"". He represents one view quite well.

&gt; At least you're admitting that Exodus is fiction, though.

No, go back and read my comment. I am explicitly saying that the account is not proven. This is not the same thing as fictional. You seem to be stuck in this black/white true/false world which is inappropriate for interpretation of historical documents."

Leftovers on Snorlax are good, aggronite is good, the rest might need to be replaced. Garchomp could go with a life orb or that rock that makes sandstorm 7 turns. Garchomp could also run rough skin and swords dance in place of sandstorm.

Next, Your movesets. I notice snorlax has ice beam, Sceptile has leaf storm AND grass knot, etc. 

The problem with those is that you have unnecessary/useless moves in places. Snorlax has a miniscule Special Attack stat, so why use a special attack like ice beam? If your Sceptile has Leaf storm, why would it need grass know?

An early means you're going to take a hit to building growth and your happiness, typically, there's no way around that. However you can catch up quickly if you do it smartly. If you are just defending, go for archery around your 3rd or 4th tech and then build 4 archers. That is a totally usable army for the early game.

If you're warmongering early on, you will be behind because of it. However, taking an enemy capital can make up for that in the long run. For early warmongering, you want to build either 2 warriors and 4 or 5 archers, or 3 archers, 2 warriors, and a catapult. This is from my experience. Buy or steal a worker and granary to improve food growth and luz resources, but you will give up some growth overall to go to war. Allying early on with a military city states helps loads because they will gift you units.

First and foremost the root of all these problems lies in a lack of education and the refusal to join mainstream society. Most Traveller kids drop out of school either after primary school (Jrn/Snr Infants,1st,2nd,3rd,4th,5th and 6th class) or they dwindle of around 2nd or 3rd year in Secondary school, this would be around 8th or 9th grade I guess. They don't really engage with school, tend to mess around and on average they achieve lower grades. They don't need school so they just leave, they get ""jobs"" in the family or with other Travelers. Put it this way, its not a priority for the parents to ensure the kids get a proper education. Its not uncommon for them to lack basic mathematical skills along with the inability to read and write. They just slip of the radar so no one really notices the kids not receiving a proper education, being brought up and taught that school is pointless doesn't help as well.

They stick to there own, they have little to no proper interaction with non-Travelers. The government, at least in Ireland, has made massive efforts to prevent any prejudice and to integrate them into mainstream society but they refuse to adhere to the law and act like normal individuals. The Traveler culture and mentality is to take what they want and to fight when ever they can, this stems from the original families loosing there homes and land during the Famine. The mentality stuck and they became desperate, this has translated to a very aggressive culture in modern times. By aggressive I mean extremely aggressive, fighting is everything to them and they don't care who it is they are fighting. The entire Traveler culture is rooted in intimidation, aggression and violence. 

The lack of education along with cultural isolation and self inflicted alienation within society leads to a very backwards and stagnant culture which reflects through the people. 

A man can't rape his wife, a man can beat his wife and kids, kids are left to run around and cause hell and if they are told to stop they are taught to rely on big groups. You get the picture, this some backwards stuff.

Girls just want to get married and have kids, they are taught how to be a good wife from a very early age and they generally don't pursue education at all bar the legally required primary school education. Minding after a baby niece, nephew or sibling is in a way practice. Obviously a child is in no way qualified or responsible enough to deal with a baby so things can and often do go wrong. Its so common to see a group of young girls pulling around a pram, with out a doubt this has something to do with the high infantile mortality rate. 

Abuse is the other most likely cause, neglect and not being taken to the doctor are the obvious ones but actual violent abuse would be another factor in all of this. Alcoholism and the mentality that its a mans house and a man runs the show leads to punches being thrown and physical and sexual abuse being rampant. I've heard and seen some real horror stories and men beating baby's to death, locking them away, stuff like that. In my town we actually had a case of a man smashing his baby up because it wouldn't stop crying, they are so far removed from normal society that the tell tale signs of abuse just aren't seen and Travelers live in a very traditional world so they would never call someone out on it or ring the police. Well, they might call someone out on it but it would be settled through more violence. Hard drug use has been added to the repertoire in the younger generations, I cant see this making things any better.


All of this, everything stems from poor education and refusing to mix with non-Travelers. 


You can see for yourself how they conduct themselves. Honestly, I just keep my mouth shut and walk in the opposite direction. I've been robbed, beaten and abused way to many times to act any other way.

It's a nasty culture, its sad that people can live in such a backwards manner when a better life is being offered to them. If you have any more questions feel free to ask, I've got plenty more stories and the culture is really complex."

Using lots of pins baste then stitch the bottom to the body section matching the center back seam to the point on the base piece. Set aside the body and start assembling the head. Stitch the darts on the head side pieces. Stitch the dart on the center head piece. I would stitch the center head piece to the chin piece matching symbols with the beak piece set into the seam so you end up with one long strip with a beak poking out.again using lots of pins I would baste then stitch the head sides to the strip you just made matching symbols.  Stuff the body, stuff the head and then slip stitch the head onto the body and tack on the feet.  Let me know if I can add more detail"

tkevik,AskWomen,1389555565.0,"Understood.

A more in-depth answer, then.  In Close-knit groups of female friends and in the LGBT community, I have found female masturbation to be a fairly open topic.

Especially in more recent years  - it seems as though there is less shame (there shouldn't be any to start with).  Everyone has their own needs, wants, and desires.  It's important to explore and find out what works to satisfy those needs.  Being in tune with your own sexuality will help you in communicating with your partner to create a more fulfilling sexual experience.

From my perspective, the topic is not at all taboo; I have spoken with a number of women that have no issue discussing the matter.  My sample may be a little skewed, though (was formerly a community health educator - one role we were expected to fill was sexual health education).

*However*, I will agree female masturbation is not discussed as openly as male masturbation.  I'm sure there are a multitude of contributing factors - from religion to slowly-fading social stigmas.  Fortunately, with an expansion in equality, a lot of formely 'taboo' topics are no longer kept hidden.  I feel like this topic is one of them.

Life-in-Death,AskMen,1389555569.0,"Sexual compatibility is HUGE...who said ""dance around the issue?""

The thing is I think it is just a little much to expect everybody to just lay it all bare when first meeting someone. 

I mean, we don't usually reveal credit scores, childhood traumas, and family skeletons on the third date, why would we let someone see how we had sex so they could decide whether or not to continue dating you.  It is kind of like ""trust me with this huge vulnerability and exposure, I mean, don't even trust me, just do it...""

I think you can get some indications of sexual compatibility from things other than sex (hot and heavy make out sessions, etc.) and I don't know how much of an indicator things always are, especially with women when they first have sex with someone they barely know.  If she doesn't get off, should she dump you right then?

Maybe I've been lucky, but I have never gotten to a relationship/sex point with a guy and have it turn out badly in the sack."

Rappers become famous via their personas. Their personas are almost always a distinct entity from their actual personalities. Pretty much all famous people have to manage their image, but rappers' fame is generated through their image.

This is just an extension of that process. The fact that you get pissed off about it means that he's succeeding. He's a *VILLAIN*. He tells you this every goddamn chance he gets. He doesn't ever claim to be a reliable or good person. YOU are imposing that on him because he makes good music and you want him to be a good person. 

Well he's told you from day one that he isn't. It's not his fault you don't believe it. And that's why I think he's interesting.

**EDIT:** Honestly, pretty much anyone can get laid if you're open about it. Sex isn't some mystical thing only men want. You just have to not be sleazy about it or treat the person you find attractive like they're less than a person. There are plenty of sexually open younger women who are attractive, too. They just tend not to be turned on by the phrase 'ey babe, wan sum fuk' or any variant thereof. Just talk to people you're interested in about stuff you're passionate about, and be open to learning about what they're passionate about. Relate on something. Throw a few funny/flirty/cheesy/whatever indicators that you might want to sleep with them in there and see how they react. If they're not interested in you that way, you've still got one more friend in the world. Which honestly isn't that bad of a deal. People are people, and the majority of them want either friends or sex at just about any given moment. 

Treat others how you want to be treated and all that other shit.

TL:DR; Chances are you wouldn't be turned on by a barely showered chick in a too large tshirt, with no makeup on and a shitty hairdo coming up to you and saying ""So, you wanna come back to my place or something?"" either. "

The fact is that the best strategy to dating is just to approach a greater number of women.

Hmm, postmodern lefty feminism also tends to be pretty critical of the Enlightenment, seeing it as justifying imperialism, capitalism, and (in the U.S. for example) slavery.

&gt; In contrast, the Dark Enlightenment advocates an autocratic and neo-monarchical society.

OK, so Less Wrong etc. and the other ""Techno-Commercialists/Futurists"" are much much closer to Enlightenment values than to any opposite.

Big goal: 83-84 in the half in May, earlier races are to measure fitness/tune up

This week started terribly but ended OK in the end.

****

**Monday**: 7.25 miles at 8:01 pace. Easy, starting to feel good again (for easy running at least). Strength in the evening. 

**Tuesday**: 6.5 at 7:58 pace with strides. I felt strong and awake, but my big toe hurt pushing off my left side. Core later.

**Wednesday**: Practice, 8 total with 2 x 2 miles (supposed to be three sets but had to cut it short) with 3:30 rest. Ran 12:48 / 12:53 and felt terrible. Everything hurt and I was shaking. Not sore, just like I had nothing to work with. When I got home I was dizzy and my stomach hurt and I peed blood. It wasn't as glorious as Once a Runner made it out to be. It actually freaked me out a lot. 

**Thursday**: 7.5 at 8:18 pace. Still in pain. Really slow.

**Friday**: 6.5 with at 7:57 pace with strides. Feeling human again, but a bit tired and sore. Abridged core later, exhausted. 

**Saturday**: Practice, 11.5 total. Starting to feel decent again. 20 mph winds and rain, still did a 6 mile tempo at about 6:48 pace and then some turnover drills. Strength after.
 
**Sunday**: 13 at 7:45 pace. A little sore but nice and energetic. Optimistic again.

****

Total was about 60, which I honestly didn't think I'd manage early in the week. By the weekend I was feeling pretty decent again. Although my big toe still hurts a little, not sure what that's about. Been icing it a lot and rolling out that foot too and that seems to help.

Racial tension, antagonism, and civil rights played an important role in the sermons of Jim Jones.[^\[source\]](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/jonestown-race/) Notably Jones compares himself to Martin Luther King,[^\[source\]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonestown#cite_note-reiterman440-93) which portrays him as a potential martyr within the framework of a violently oppressive racist society. Later in the tape you can him ask rhetorically ""Are we black, proud, and socialist?"" during the suicides.

One of the key appeals of communism over capitalism in this time period was the racism present in American culture and institutions. What Jones is trying to say is that the white people left because they could easily return to an America which favored their race. He's painting the African Americans into a corner by trying to convince them that they would be persecuted and possibly killed if they returned to America."

ricree,StarWarsEU,1389556510.0,"A bit late to the party, but here's my take on it. For the sake of the post, I'm going to assume pretty much complete editorial control, including the ability to commission books that didn't actually exist. So not so much what the Story Group is doing, as it is imagining an alternate universe where a much more streamlined EU was created in the first place.

**Thrawn Trilogy:** 

Probably the least unchanged here. I didn't care that much for the actual Katana fleet plotline, even if it was a big conflict driver, but everything else was golden. Karrade and the smugglers, Thrawn, that espionage source and the political drama it caused, etc, are definite keepers.

**Courtship:**  buh-bye

**X-Wing:**

Both series are strong keepers. Maybe could be pared down a touch, but overall very worthwhile and important.

**Jedi Academy / I,Jedi:**

Keeps the academy arc itself, but that's about it. The whole Sun Crusher/superweapon of the week thing would be pitched, though I liked Kyp's story overall, so you'd need *something* to fill that role. Just something a little less absurd.

I'd turn this one into two largish books, the first one being the Exar Kun arc at the academy, while the second is the downfall of Leonia Tavira (ditching the first person pov and adding non-Corran viewpoints).

The unifying plot thread between the two might be the biggest surprise here, but I'd actually appropriate the Daala plot from Darksaber. I know that the book is rightly panned, but I actually liked her arc in it. In that one, she's basically someone who's competent, but whose ambition far outstripped her ability. She unifies most of the disparate splinters of the imperial military, but just doesn't have the skill to use it properly. I also liked Pellaeon's presence, and it's a good bridge from his first appearance to his later role in the Hand of Thrawn series. I also love the idea of putting her and Tavira together in the same series so they can play off one another. We never got to see them together in the real canon, but I think the two would have had a fantastic dynamic. 

It would also set the stage for the unified imperial remnant we see later. In this, they'd be the remnants of the old imperial bureaucracy. Holding themselves together via sheer administrative competence, they just don't have the military muscle since most of the top commanders struck out for themselves once Coruscant fell. Corrupt and oily at times, sure, but by and large their worlds are the best run, have the best courts, best social services, etc. In this case, Daala's handover wouldn't just be to Pellaeon, but rather it would put it into his hands as they rejoin the fold into the single, unified Imperial Remnant we see in HoT.

**Black Fleet Crisis:**

I was tempted to pitch it, but I don't think I will. Instead, I'm moving it pre Jedi Academy, so we can get more look at the fallout from the fall of the empire. Lando's arc gets pitched*. Luke's can stay, but it needs a better motivation, one that actually has some payoff for readers instead of a pointless lie that never goes anywhere. I'd also tone down the Yevetha, so that they're just a skilled and expansionist people rather than the engineer-sues they were in the actual story. There'd also be some more interaction with leftover Imperial warlords, the ones that will show up in the new Jedi Academy, but they're side characters at best. It's more about establishing groundwork and character than serious plot arcs for them.

\* Which is a shame. Can we all agree that Lando was woefully underused in the EU? I'm sure there's something I'm missing, but the only writer I can think of that did him justice was AC Crispen. And even there, he's very much a secondary character to Han.

**Dark Empire:**

Nope. See /u/tunnel-snakes-rule for why.

**Darksaber. Children. Crystal Star:** 

Nope, Nope, Nope. We already grabbed the one halfway decent thing in Darksaber. The rest is pointless.

**Hand of Thrawn:**

Pretty much as is. But the neat thing here is how it fits into the overall EU. This time, its relation isn't just a bunch of retcons, veiled take-thats, and attempts to build something coherent from what came before. Instead, it's the culmination of plot elements that have been building and building throughout everything that has come before it. Rather than being a fix-fic, it's the logical conclusion of this entire overarching story. Much more satisfying that way.

I also might get rid of the Karrade story, or at least pare it down considerably. It was fun, but took up way too much space for what it accomplished.


**Overall Goals:**

The idea here is to get away from the pointless random superweapons, and into what I feel is the meat of this part of the timeline: fulfilling the promise of the rebellion's victory, and dealing with its fallout. There's still a huge fleet out there once the emperor fell, and the only thing saving the Rebellion is that every idiot with a Star Destroyer wants to go out and put themselves at the top of the heap.

The idea of the leftover warlords was neat, but poorly executed. It should have been about scores of larger than life egos, all scrabbling against one another for position and advantage. There's still a lot of room for mystical elements and great supervillains (it's still Star Wars, after all), but this should be done in the context of a vibrant political background.

So by the end of HoT, we've gone from a fragmented, wartorn galaxy still chaotic and reeling, into a stable, peaceful state that can finally take a deep breath and start rebuilding. Sure, the Empire and Republic don't exactly like one another, but they're at last in a place where they can coexist. War's over, plot threads starting back from the original trilogy are finally resolved to their natural conclusion, and everyone can finally look forward to a brighter future.

Or an apocalyptic invasion. Which I'll cover in my next post when I look towards the NJO."

enlightened-giraffe,photography,1389556529.0,"First of all a prime is a fixed focal length lens, no zooming, it does one focal length but it does it very well.

The advantage is the wider aperture (lower f number) so that it lets in more light, very helpful in capturing usable photos in low light situations. Also, because they have a simpler optical formula that doesn't need to vary (zoom) they always outperform zoom lenses in sharpness, contrast (their sweet spot is usually stopped down about 2-3 stops) and optical distortion. Compared to any of your current lenses it would be quite a difference.

For the casual photographer the biggest advantage of fast primes (compared to kit zooms) is the shallow depth of field created by the very wide aperture (photos like [this](http://www.aputure.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/2007-11-21_.jpg)).

The lens i mentioned, the 50mm F1.8, is one the best values in the Canon line-up, it's very very cheap (around $100) and very sharp. It's a bit tight in smaller rooms because the 50mm makes it a bit long (you can check the field of view by setting your current lens to 50mm) but it's great fun to use it and you will get photos that you just wouldn't be able to with any of your current lenses."

It's a logic problem. First we have X trait in the human body. We can study what X trait does and what it allows us to do. And we also know what the end goal is (reproduction). So then we look at X trait and we try to determine how it helps us get to that goal.

An employer may not discharge, refuse employment to, or take any other adverse employment action against an employee who chooses not to have his or her wages paid by direct deposit.

But from some reading online, you basically have to take the employer to court if they're forcing direct deposit and Florida doesn't really care all that much about the law.

Keep in mind a lot of people had to travel around and they didn't become Travelers. Either way they were general perceived as the lower class of society, they were known to be a rough bunch before they even came to be known as Travelers. Its absolutely nothing like First Nation natives and the general US population, they are just people that live a certain way. 

Celtic, not really. Celtic doesn't equal Irish, thats a common misconception. The Celts were just one of many groups to set foot on the Isles, the UK is just as much a Celtic nation as Ireland. Boudicca, who is perhaps the most famous Celt was from Wales/England. 
No one is really Celtic, so many groups have come and tried to claim the Isles or integrated into what ever group was already there that the idea of a true Celt living in Ireland or the UK is just a romantic fairytale.

They are as Celtic as anyone else is, which is to say not much. "

thewarrenisempty,powerlifting,1389556783.0,"I've been doing 5/3/1 for six cycles and started using a training max of 80% at 310lbs. The highest weight I've pulled in a training session in 6 months is 335lbs on my last 5/3/1 week which I hit for 13 reps. Yesterday I pulled 410x3 and 440x1 doing my first joker sets (read beyond 5/3/1 over the holidays).

High volume at relatively low percentages has blown my deadlift the fuck up. I'd recommend just doing the program as laid out and if it doesnt work, then you can modify it. 12 weeks is nothing in the big picture, powerlifting is a marathon not a sprint.

*** Actually read the program before writing this bit. It's a peaking program designed to taper towards a PR. The high volume/low intensity weeks taper into moderate volume/intensity then high intensity/low volume in the last block. If you screw with the percentages now you're likely gonna miss reps going into the 2nd and 3rd blocks."

The visiting of the shrine however, by public officials seems to end up being more of a political ""litmus"" test to show their mad patriotic cred to the relatively active right-wing (read: people who actually vote) base by the majority of the LDP. The most controversial part of the shrine complex is the private museum run by the shrine owners. 

Controversy stems from the fact the shrine is now privately run by a couple of individuals with somewhat....""rose-tinted"" view of Imperial Japanese history (understatement of the year) and the fact the vast majority of the war crims found guilty by the IMTFE was interred secretly. 

Shrine is also visited by relatives of the dead soldiers (understandable if you consider how nominally Shinto most Japanese are) , most notably ex-Taiwanese president Lee-Tseng Hui, who's brother died in the IJN. "

But through my experience, complaints usually are regarding one or more of the following:

- Strong scents from products such as hair spray, perfume, cologne, body sprays, or any other strongly scented body product. Some people just can't stand certain smells. 

- Smoke. Some people smell like an ashtray and that's a big one and usually goes with the first one I have listed. A lot of people will try and cover up the smell, but it ends up being a nostril nightmare. 

- Clothes did not wash or dry correctly. This usually results in a mildew-type smell. You yourself might not notice after being around it for a moment. 

- Foot Oder / Shoes. People who workout or do a sport before work, even if they change their shoes, have this problem sometimes. 

- Generally just someone being unhygienic. Did not bathe, horrible breathe, or something along those lines. I highly doubt this is your issue. 

So keep in mind, some of these things can easily be overlooked. You might really like your deodorant scent and not notice it when you pair it with some perfume, and don't notice that your coat smells like smoke from your roommate... but someone out there will always say something. And unfortunately, it does have to go back to you. 

For your job, I'm not sure if they're allowed to mention WHAT was reported exactly, I know for HR reasons we could not. But you could always ask. 

Lastly, don't take it too hard. The worst thing is for it to keep happening. That's when people talk. I've had a number of these conversations, and only a select few were repeats. Those repeats were because those people did not bathe. I also assumed it would be horrible to be in contact with that person again after having a talk like that... but it actually isn't that bad. Both parties just act like it didn't happen and it goes away really quick.

&gt;Oh, here we go again. Just a few sentences ago you were talking about how we are part of the natural processes, so by your own definition anything we do will ""fit in with"" the natural processes.

Anything we do does fit in.  It's just how much of what we do that affects the system.  There's a saying that there are substantial effects with doing nothing.

&gt;lolwat. I'm pretty sure animal life was getting along just fine for millions of years before humans showed up to oh-so-graciously ""cull"" them.

You just agreed with me.  Humans have changed the environment so much in only a thousand years.  We've got to be part of the new process now.  That means culling.

&gt;I'll put aside for a moment your assumption that we have someg kind of moral duty to regulate animal populations, and just point out that killing is not the only way to control populations.

If we have a moral duty to protect animals, we have a moral duty to regulate them the best way possible.  We have, therefore, a duty to kill them too.  Not getting around that argument.  It's basic science.  BIDE:  Births, deaths, immigration, emigration.  That regulates populations sizes.  One of these will not only be economically feasible, but also be most effective at controlling all other factors considering the dollar invested.  That's deaths.  

No.  You don't have a good argument.  And I'm not going to waste my time responding as I am shutting you down here.

It's all a bunch of ethical misinformation aiming to ruin conservation Now, you want to think about tranquilizing animals and moving them.  Where?  You want to introduce them blindly to other ecosystems which are stressed or not yet equilibrated yet?  To heck with you. You're making my job harder.

How many deer do you want to move?  How much money and time are you going to put into it?  Guess what!  You broke the funding system we had considering hunting pays for itself and for the conservation. 

How about the food pantries that depend on the meat from hunters to feed the poor?  Screw them.  Animals are pretty to look at and people are at fault for not being altruistic.  So let's do nothing and blame people while others starve.  

I'm going to repeat this.  Animals can have the right to live because the law says so (wanton waste).  But we have the responsibility to make sure ALL animals can live according to the natural process. Not just individuals.  And that means regulating a species for the betterment of all.  Killing is something that we can do very well and is extremely effective at conserving wildlife.  So, let's do it.

Glad you agreed with me.

ComradeVoytek,pcmasterrace,1389557071.0,"I just beat it like a week ago, and don't get me wrong, it was fantastic, but the game has a lot of missteps.  The Last of Us nailed story, atmosphere, convincing character development and the whole thing was just this great ride. 

The Last of Us had okay gameplay, okay pacing and there were some weak parts in the writing. The first like 3 hours hold your hand so badly you might as well be watching. To me, the game was outright boring for what amounts to the first 15% or so. 

This made it especially painful for any replays. I tried to replay it, since screw it, it was already in the machine and I wanted to try my hand at Survivor difficulty, but I couldn't get past the intro with enough interest to keep going.

 The gameplay is serviceable. There is nothing inherently wrong with it, but it's pretty dull.  I'm not saying they had to do something revolutionary, but it plays it really safe. There are a few moments, where like clockwork you can say, ""Well, it's been quiet and slow burning for the past 20 minutes... (which were absolutely my favourite parts, the parts in which the world feels dead and desolate, not like a hollywood movie. This is where the game shines gloriously.) ... they'll be throwing a horde moment at me any minute. And sure enough, either a boss like monster, or this unrelenting horde out of nowhere sparks a trite chase or stand your ground moment.
 
There's a few times where the game tries to be really emotional in the middle, particularly around the Dam and the farm house immediately after, only to have heartfelt speech broken up with, ""WE'VE GOT COMPANY"" and ""GUYS, I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALONE ANYMORE"". Moments in which a small horde of baddies just throw themselves against you, and it feels like they're shoving this completely average gameplay in your face, taking away from their excellent character building moments. 

Anyways, I'm not trying to shit on the game. It's probably in my top 10 games of this generation. It did a lot of things well, and as a whole I think the industry of games, particularly more mature, story driven and atmosphere rich ones, are better off because of it. It's simply that I hate that it feels like it's immune to criticism, or that it didn't have a handful of lame moments.  "

Ker_Splish,electricians,1389557157.0,"US Railroads man.  I'm working at a railroad, and it's pretty good.  

You can go either track signal, locomotive, or industrial/facilities maintenance electrician; if you get on you can expect to ""top out"" (under the current contract)  at about $28/hour.  

Full benefits, Railroad Retirement instead of Social Security, and after a couple of years you could get promoted to foreman or foreman general.  (My boss' boss is a foreman general, at the end of his contract he's going to be making about $95,000 per year!) 

With Railroad Retirement, you can retire at age 60 + 30 years of service (you have to hit these two minimums, so for them to hit at the same time you'd have to be hired on at age 30) and you can expect to draw about $4500 a month until you die.  (If you're married, your spouse actually gets another separate 50% of what you get when you retire, so that would put your combined household retirement income at around $6750 per month.)  

I'm biased, but RR is a good way to go, even if you don't get a promotion.  You get a comfortable wage, stock options, lots of benefits, and we'll call it a very ""non demanding"" daily work pace.  "

Just to think about being in a life/death situation and having to call a person 10 miles away to take down my information like I'm setting up an appointment. Then to have that person radio a squad car who's 2 miles away and wait for them to arrive. And when they do arrive they're not required to provide assistance.

userNameNotLongEnoug,techsupport,1389557512.0,"As I'm sure you've understood by now, if you're on your work's network they can easily monitor what URLs you visit and when. They could even monitor the content of the data (passwords, etc) on unencrypted pages, but its unlikely that they do. 

If you want to hide the content, you could try [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp/reviews?hl=en) which will encrypt more sites that would be encrypted otherwise, but it won't help on sites that don't support https. This also won't hide what sites you visit, just their actual content. 

If you want to hide the sites you visit completely, and you have access on your work computer, you could use a [VPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) via a [paid provider](http://lifehacker.com/5935863/five-best-vpn-service-providers).

Even if you are able to set up a VPN with your work computer, I would advise against it since taking steps to avoid your employers monitoring is probably unacceptable to them and you could get in trouble. If you do go that route, please research your company's policies so that you are informed of the risk you are taking. It's obviously best and easiest to just use your work computer for work approved things.

That said, if you are concerned about privacy I do recommend using a VPN at home. I find my service to be well worth the money I pay for it, namely because I often find myself in a country who thinks they know what websites I should be allowed to visit and there are times when I think its better my ISP not know exactly what I'm doing.

dermesser,askscience,1389557520.0,"&gt; (Is there an additional cost for sending/receiving data from other ISPs? I would imagine that the companies owning intercontinental fibre cables wouldn't give away access for free, for example.)

Good point! In fact, ISPs, especially the so-called ""Tier 1"" providers such as Level3, Hurricane Electric which only have transit traffic, want to be paid for the traffic they receive from their customers (local/national telcos). So your ISP has to pay its ISP (as you have a bigger network you're attached to - your provider - your provider has one as well) for the traffic it sends to them.

At Exchange Points like DE-CIX in Frankfurt (Germany), AMS-IX (Amsterdam), PAIX (Palo Alto), many big networks may interconnect which is called peering. Because every network attached there is quite huge and is interested in fast and cheap traffic exchange, peering at such exchange points is in general free. Details can be found at DE-CIX's homepage: http://www.de-cix.net/about/what-is-an-ix/

Compared to the costs for maintaining a fast and stable network the traffic payments may almost be neglected. Especially in Europe (that's where I know the situation) the backbone capacity (cables used by Tier-1-ISPs) is not really exhausted and traffic is really really cheap.

Vid-Master,AskReddit,1389557577.0,"I get these sometimes, my mother does too.

My mom usually runs out of her room thinking there is a mouse or spider crawling on her.

For me, it is a LOT worse. It is rare for it to happen, and it is actually more interesting than scary to me because of the mind altering effects it has.

I will detail all of them for you, the users of Reddit.

1.) My friend was at my house, we were asleep. I dreamt / half awake that there was a combination animal (hedgehog and groundhog) scurrying around in my room, I could easily see it in my mind even though the lights were off and the room was pitch black, I jumped off the bed and almost tripped getting to the light switch, as soon as the light turned on I ""snapped out of it"" and started laughing.

2.) I was on the verge of falling asleep I think, the window next to me had a little bit of light coming through it. I suddenly thought for sure that I saw something move on the window, I actually sat up (I think? LOL) and looked at the window, the moving thing moved again, it looked like long, thin black legs... it was a GIANT spider! I then looked right above me, to see a spider hanging down right in front of my face. The legs were gigantic, the thing could have easily wrapped around my head. I didn't want to jump up and meet the spider with my face, so I did some sort of strange roll / crawl off the side of my bed, after that I moved at a disturbing pace to the lightswitch, after I flicked it on and looked at the ""giant spiders"", they were gone. I started laughing and went to bed.

3.) I had a dream I was on Reddit one day, typing out all the times I have had night terrors. Warlizard was on, and everyone was trolling him about the Warlizard Gaming forums. It was great, just as Reddit usually is. But then, suddenly, something wasn't right. I realized that I was writing about this very moment. Time has stopped.

When I was still a racer a few years back I had a habit of leaving the shoulder straps on my spyder zip off bibs, hanging behind me as to facilitate easy pant removal before races or training runs in just the gs suit.  Sure enough what was bound to happen, happened on the crappy old 3 person lift during a day of training at the home hill in northern mn. In front of a line of 15 fellow racers the shoulder strap gets snagged on the bungee cord hook holding the additional seat cushion down. I feel a tug getting off and next thing I know I trip the safety stop and am hanging off the lift just high enough to where my entire body is suspended by the strap. Took about 10 seconds for the liftie to help me disengage but god was it emarassing to be dangling by the seat of my pants in front of my friends and the rest of the packed ski hill.

And I wouldn't offer Davis big $$$. He's above average, imo. If he wants big $$$, then let him walk while we scout and draft another CB at 2nd or 3rd round in the draft. This can be done. Cut Toler if it's possible in regards to our cap space. 

And I would let Bethea walk and draft another guy to replace him. 

I mean, there's no way the defense can get any worse than it is anyways. So, why cling onto these players? 

Basically, draft defense while put FA $$$ on the offensive line. 

At last but not least, Manusky isn't an elite coach and I don't think he will be elite anyways. He's simply above average. If you ain't feeling Manusky, then feel free to express your desire to fire him. But also feel free to suggest a better defensive coordinator to replace Manusky. Not sure if Wade Philips is that guy, imo. He's good enough to field any team a good or above average defense but never elite (see NE vs Texans, Colts vs Texans, etc).  "
pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389557631.0,"If Scotland and Ireland agreed to be a part of UK and to give all their sovereign laws to UK and it is proven historically that voting was not tampered with then the decision was done democratically and should be accepted.

If now some Scots or Irish decided for their parts of UK to quit UK then obviously they should first apply for a representative in UK's parliament from their local area like they already do. Only when majority of the elected people from those area's made a serious case showing UK that they want to leave and do it democratically then it would of course made sense as Scots or Irish leaving UK is debated and decided on UK level, not on Scotland and Irish only level.

Comparing Scotland and Ireland to UK and EU is different. UK has most of its rights un-tampered with. EU can't do most of the things, which UK can now can do in N.Ireland or Scotland. Also, EU parliament does NOT have anything to do with the UK's decision for quitting EU. It is entirely for UK's people to decide about this. What's the point of sending a representative to EU parliament, for him not to do anything there (besides taking money) especially knowing that EU doesn't have any decision on UK leaving EU?"

Refining its criteria, on the other hand, seems more useful."

If a studio wanted to elaborate on a game they had to make a fully fledged sequel, which also meant that they had the opportunity to improve existing and explore new game mechanics. Instead, with DLC, we're seeing average games stretched out longer with more mediocre content when a sequel could've fixed many glaring issues."

onionmancer,law,1389558026.0,"""targeting"" is an awfully sinister way to phrase asking a question!  I asked you that question because you seem dead certain about your choice to go to law school was a good one and your conviction that everything will work out OK, even though you have not articulated a plan for how you will get paid to do the lawyering that you want to do.  Often those people are the ones who end up the most disappointed with their careers.

Figuring out your short-term and long-term career goals and getting working on that immediately (via clinics, summer jobs, during-law-school jobs, networking events, etc.) is the only way that things will work out OK.  I mean, it's possible you'll get lucky or you go to Yale so you don't have to sweat finding a job that will pay you to work for the indigent or near-indigent, but that doesn't apply to most people.   Building a connection with an employer during the semester is the best way to get hired over the summer, which is the best way to get invited back next summer, which is the best way to get hired on graduation.

For example, for many service jobs, being bilingual (spanish, but sometimes mandarin) is a virtual requirement in many parts of the country, and will be a huge boost to your resume  In many parts of the country, a smart 1L interested in public service that doesn't already speak spanish would start learning ASAP.  Or, you could be volunteering with a pro bono org you want to work with after your second semester. 

Law schools aren't going  to do any of the things you note they should, at least not any time soon.  My point is that _you_ personally need to start building connections now so that by the time you graduate you will have the connections to find a job.  Starting now gives you a huge leg up on all the people who treat law school like an extension of undergrad, waiting until 2L (or, for many public interest-minded lawyers, after they graduate) to find a permanent job and not meeting any practicing lawyers until they themselves are in practice.  

In particular, I am reminded of someone at my t14 school that just bounced from fellowship to fellowship, and now, 3-5 years out from graduation, she is asking me to help get a firm job because she is sick of the instability that she has faced.  If she had done a targeted job search at school and networked towards that goal, she would not be in this position now.

You have a great window of opportunity to position yourself ahead of your classmates if you put yourself out there now. "

People do need to be more careful about what they are buying. Especially when it's an expensive item. That being said, I've never seen anyone get ripped off in this sub.

Video games are another. Those help my patience more than anything. I found when first playing board games that I would focus on the top of the tower when I should've built a foundation. For instance, I'm a huge fan of sports games, and in many of the playing modes one can be a coach or a gm.

That's what I just talked about. In the case of imported wives, there's a power imbalance that could very well render a prenup unenforceable. You might want to talk to a good lawyer first.

&gt; 2) If you want to have kids with her and avoid a greater chance of divorce with massive child support, get out of OC and move somewhere more isolated. Country neighbors will not turn your foreign wife into an Ameriskank, and the country is really where you want to raise children anyhow.

That's normally 8-ish hours.

It also depends on what you've burned - a fire that's made up of a log cleft into sticks (no more than a cm thick) will go cold very quickly.

If whole unsplit log pieces have been used, I'd say that you could easily have red-hot pieces 24 hours later.

And then there's the whole ""hot ashes and flammable materials""-thing.

RB: Abate and Maicon. Toss up between the two. IF Maicon down the road is the superior choice.

4 the odour origin can be anywhere, sofa, car, overcoat, clothes hamper. You can try or/ and aerosol deodorant , medicated talcum. I spray the inside armpit of heavy coats, and put talc in my shoes.

So small and large aren't attributed to the amount of liquid but rather the cup.

Since there is no small, medium, or large standard. Businesses can claim their own sizing standard which may not even be relevant to the amount of liquid.

As long as they don't specify that you're getting more product.

False advertising requires the vendor to advertise something about a product and the product has to under-perform, owner has to show intent to mislead substantial portion of consumers, the deception must effect the purchasing methods, also the consumer must prove injury from buying the product. Overpaying $1 isn't enough to provide injury I'd reckon.

False advertising isn't applied or relevant when the consumer assumes or is ignorant.

If you as a customer asked what's the difference and they told you that you get more, specifically more fluids, with the larger drink then yes you'd have a case. You'd have to prove that the employer also told their employees to say that.

If an employee didn't know/unwillingly lied because they never measured them then you wouldn't have a strong case. Since the employer could argue that the employee was ignorant/explained poorly.

Signs/menus are really easy to avoid false advertising. You're writing in text and you're allowed to ""sell"" your product using vague terms. So if you're vague enough you can say almost anything.

A 1980's Reuters report on an earthquake is a historical document - but so is ""The Protocols of the Elders Of Zion"". A historical document is one from a time prior to our own which is used to inform our understanding of a particular time or incident: it does not mean ""a history"". With this level of basic misunderstanding of historical method, I'm not sure that there is much point in continuing.

I don't feel bad. I already gave him the option of getting to know each other as friends first, but he was the one who steered our first meeting towards a distinctly romantic bent.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1389559357.0,"Have you considered a 30 with an extender to break it in?  It sounds like what you actually want is a 31 band, and you'll get more life and wear from your bras if you add to a 30 instead of wearing a 32 on the tightest notch.  Assuming those measurements are current, it does seem like a 30E/F is going to be your best bet.  It's possible your current bra is a bit of a shape mismatch, which is why the cups appear big, and it's also possible that after 6 months on the tightest notch, it's worn out and doesn't hold your scoop and swoop anymore. 
(Also, just in case because I wasn't clear what you meant by ""gone through swoop and scoop"", swoop and scoop doesn't stop.  You have to do it every time you put on a bra, forever.)

YeraSoraVira,GradSchool,1389559588.0,"Often universities will offer some kind of assistantship along with a tuition waiver. This means that you aren't paying tuition (though I do pay fees, a few hundred dollars/semester) and you get paid every month. It's not often a lot (what I make is about as high as it gets in field biology, many of my fellow grad students make 12-15k/year) but if you are smart often you can live off of it. 

Assistantships typically fall into two categories, research and teaching.

Teaching Assistantships (TAs) have some kind of teaching requirement, which will vary from school to school and possibly semester to semester but will probably take up a lot of your time and you have to do everything else around your teaching. Teaching can be really enjoyable, or just grading, or somewhere in between. I'm not on a TA myself, so I can't say much more then that some of my labmates LOVE it and some HATE it. 

Research Assistantships (RAs) are often paid out of grants for a particular project, so you are getting paid to do your research. These TEND to pay better, but are also more competitive and over the past few years seem to be becoming less common, at least in field/wildlife biology.

Depending on what field you are in how you go about getting either of these will vary. If you are in Biology I'd be happy to give you more details on that, but if you are in another branch of science someone in that field will have much more useful specifics.  "

Every couple years or so I get a variation of the same dream. Last time was about a week ago.

No it isn't and if you were to ask some Irish or Scottish people about it (hopefully someone academic and or historians) they will tell you so.

&gt;Erm, the Scottish independence issue is being decided on a Scottish level not a UK level.

Only because UK allowed them to do it!

&gt;The EU parliament makes decisions that affect the UK the same way that the UK parliament makes decisions that affect the home nations.

EU decisions mostly apply here to common market and things within whole Europe. They don't interfere with everything.

&gt;It is by standing for election on these issues that the parties bring support to these ideals

Yes, but locally where those things can actually be implemented. Not on another planet.

&gt; If the predictions are true and a majority of seats go to the party that wishes to leave then the mainstream political parties will have to take notice

You mean majority of EU elections from UK parties? So basically people say we want to quit EU but don't want to vote UKIP? Otherwise UKIP would have won majority in UK elections.

&gt;Hell the promised EU referendum from the conservatives came as a response to the rise of UKIP.

After all they are both right wing, aren't they?

&gt;Hence why I will be voting for them, so as to get a referendum

Good for you. It's strange though as Cameron has said he WILL give EU elections if he wins. If Cameron looses, UKIP gets 15% and Labour wins forget about the EU elections any time soon."

I don't think they have a problem with Hermione or anything, and it seems like that have a decent relationship otherwise, but they probably do resent the magical world a bit, and would therefore not be particularly interested in learning everything about it. And considering all that Hermione goes through at school, she's probably not terribly excited to tell them all about it either.

TruthfulNudge,DebateReligion,1389560066.0,"Doesn't Pascal's wager support theism? Given your citations I'm sure you're  trying to start a powerful debate, but I'm a bit unclear as to your argument. The comments haven't helped. This is how I've interpreted your post, please let me know if I've addressed it appropriately. 

Pascal's Wager, from what I've learned, is that one lives their life as if God exists because the outcome is far better than if one lived a life if God did not exist. 

The caveat to this is that Pascal was specifically referring to Christian Hell. If Hell exists then one avoids Hell by following God's word because following God's word implicitly prevents one being Hellbound. It's wonderfully circular, but the point was that worst case scenario God and Hell don't exist and you've lived a moral, virtuous life, because that's the benefit of God's word. 

The last part as well as the belief in scripture I think is where you're proposing a debate - if scripture is indeed God's word, how do you know which scripture is authentic? Further, specific scripture (in this case the Qu'ran and Bible) proposes that previous scriptures of other religions should be referenced leading to a contradiction because those books disavow later holy books. 

I believe a modern, sensible version of Pascal wager would be - a person who strives to be as moral and just as possible serves a better life than one who lives chaotically. The interpretation of Heaven and Hell as actual planes of existence will consistently cause schism with each other and logical arguments. Non religious metaphysical systems such as Kant's suffer from this problem without having any theological underpinnings. I don't think you'll find a satisfactory answer to your question because it seems to apply to specific elements of two faiths that require a very specific interpretation to have the wager be applicable. My personal response would be to use the modern definition I gave above which is admittedly not particularly strict. As a Muslim, I hope that suffices, but my gut tells me you want an ""Islamic"" response to which I don't believe there is one. Too many schools are willing to interpret core text differently. 

Did that help or did I just ramble?"

If we had the technology to perform a simultaneous brain transplant (i.e. swapping the brains of two living people) and performed that on two trans people of opposite genders, we'd be left with two happy, healthy (in both mind and body) people. On the other hand, if you transplanted a psychopath's brain into a different body, he'd still be a psychopath. So where does the ""disorder"" thing come from?"

tastytoast,AdviceAnimals,1389560255.0,"This is all extremely helpful advice, especially the part about calorie dense food and eating consistently small meals throughout the day.  I would just like to add a plug for /r/gainit, /r/gainitmeals, and would like to suggest you use a TDEE calculator AS WELL AS a BMR calculator.  TDEE is the amount calories your body burns in a 24 hour period, sleeping, working, exercising, playing and digesting food.!  The calculator (while not 100% accurate) is designed to give you your TDEE based on a BMR + TOTAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE. Straight from [the wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate):
&gt;About 70% of a human's total energy expenditure is due to the basal life processes within the organs of the body (see table). About 20% of one's energy expenditure comes from physical activity and another 10% from thermogenesis, or digestion of food (postprandial thermogenesis).

What this means is that, while it is helpful for knowing your BMR to sustain the ~80% energy expenditure of doing nothing but living and maintaining your body mass, if you do not account for the increased 20% activity of working out then you will actually lose weight since you were only ingesting enough calories to maintain your BMR.  So:

* Lower caloric intake than BMR lower than TDEE / no exercise = weight loss
* Higher caloric intake than BMR lower than TDEE / with exercise = lean weight loss
* Higher caloric intake than BMR including TDEE / no exercise = fat gain
* Higher caloric intake than BMR including TDEE / with exercise = muscle gain

As a skinny guy who has had a difficult time eating enough I would like to recommend some tips and calorie dense snacks that helped me eat enough without feeling sick or bloated (please note, I have celiac and will not be including any gluten products):

* Stop smoking (appetite suppressant)
* Stop drinking coffee (appetite suppressant)
* Substitute water or whole milk for all beverages, especially soda
* Meal replacement bars eaten before breakfast (This was a big one, I am always so busy in the mornings that being able to scarf down a bar seriously jump-started my metabolism right off the bat)
* Nuts : almonds, peanuts, cashews (easy to eat, healthy, not too filling; I honestly keep a bag in my pocket to munch on at all times; If you don't like nuts try adding chocolate)
* Dark chocolate with almonds (LOL since I don't like almonds)
* Peanutbutter on everything
* Cook everything with Coconut Oil
* Added heavy whipping cream to my gainer shake
* Added pasteurized raw eggs
* Oatmeal (sparingly, since it is filling)
* Rice (sparingly, since it is filling)
* Cheese
* Traditional greek yogurt (none of that 0% fat crap)

**EDIT:** If you haven't found a gainer you like, I would recommend [THIS (that's 12, you heard right, 12 mother fucking POUNDS of gainer for $40!)](http://www.supplementwarehouse.com/viewitem.asp?idproduct=162865).

A lot of these ""conspiracy theories"" are actually quite popular, and extend beyond RP/BP squabbles. You talk to enough guys at the gym who regularly weight lift, and while exchanging ideas you'll very often hear how they avoid soy protein powder and favour whey. 

I haven't been keeping up in the past few years (because I'm not an athlete anymore and frankly I've relaxed and gotten a lot more lazier about checking latest health trends), but it had been the case that whey protein was a more popular and more expensive protein supplement than soy. 

Back when Jamba Juice had a free supplement per drink (until the past year or two), soy was a free option and whey was not. I also paid about anywhere from 30% to 50% less for jugs of soy protein powder vs whey protein powder.

While this doesn't ""prove"" that soy is worse, it does show pretty clearly that enough people believe the inferiority of soy to actually have significant market impact. A lot of men do care about their testosterone levels.

A lot of these other conspiracy theories are quite popular as well.

Why does this matter?

If one mocks literally *every* idea of his enemy, he will end up being an obnoxious person to more than his intended opponent. 

Some guys talked about their opposition to gov't surveillance (before the NSA revelations, before everyone suddenly started piping up about how they already *knew* this was happening and how obvious it was). Some others complain about the flouridation of water. 

Some conspiracy theories or beliefs may be more valid than others. Sure you can mock them all, *""Oh suuuuuure, these are all feeeemale conspiracies designed to poison and control men.""* But in all likelihood, you're probably just antagonizing some otherwise pleasant guys who don't even know about the manosphere."

onionmancer,law,1389560601.0,"A perfectly reasonable view to have, but as you've seen, that's not a constitutional argument under current or any historical jurisprudence.  Discrimination based on wealth or income by means-testing government services triggers rational basis scrutiny, and means-testing a program to ensure its viability and to comport with its mission as a poverty-amelioriation program is a rational basis to discriminate.  There's a legitimate policy goal you're pursuing by means-testing. 

Whereas, if you had a medicaid program that was open only to white people, it's doomed on both ends of strict-scrutiny review.  Not only is the standard of review higher, but there's no possible conceivable legitimate policy goal one could achieve by having a whites-only program.

The constitution doesn't protect against bad public policy, or, except for certain exceptions, unfair public policy.

I am not sure what the justification would be historically, but, a modern judge would probably say something like: ""The constitution sets the outer bounds for permissible policymaking, but it's not courts' job to meddle in democratic process generally.  We tend to scrutinize more when discrimination is based on immutable characteristics or on personal views where we want to promote freedom of conscience (i.e. religious discrimination, and the broad ban on viewpoint-based discrimination under the 1st amendment).  Rich people are not going to be procedurally excluded from the policymaking process or otherwise not have their voices heard, and even if it would be better in some sense to open medicaid to all, it's sensible to means-test government programs in a world of limited resources, so, no EPC claim.""

If there is an affirmative right to something, then you can't deny that right to anybody.  So, if there was a constitutional amendment that guaranteed free health care ratified tomorrow,  a rule or procedure that denied somebody access to health care would undergo strict scrutiny.  

But, because there is no right to health care, rich people don't have the right to access programs tailored for the poor. 

Another way to think about it: a means-tested is program is available to everybody, if they become poor.  A racially discriminatory program forever shuts out some individuals.  If means-testing programs is unfair, it's unfair to ""discriminate"" by having any program that targets people in any specified, non-universal circumstance.  

For example, a childless person doesn't benefit (directly) from subsidized child care services, because they don't have a kid.  Is that somehow unfair?  People will generally tell you no, because that person has equal access to that program if they have a kid.  Any number of programs can trigger the same analysis.  Farm subsidies (no farm, no subsidies.  DISCRIMINATION!!!), intellectual property laws (it doesn't protect you unless you register a copyright or file a patent), terrorism insurance under TRIA, student loan forgiveness programs based on income or public service.  Some tax deductions are only available to lower-income people (EITC, student loan deductions which phase out as income increases), and some are only available to people with wealth or property (mortgage interest deductions, the estate tax cap, itemized deductions in general).  

Public policy in general is about identifying certain problems or behaviors and coming up with a tailored fix to address them.  Complaining about ""discrimination"" because certain programs only apply to certain people at certain times is nonsensical."

stick_it_in_your_bum,relationships,1389560629.0,"&gt;I find myself fantasizing about moving away, being by myself, and living only for myself for a while to truly learn who I am and to work on myself. **I know this is possible to do while in a relationship**, but I feel like I want to be alone for a while to prove that I can make it on my own.

I think this is the key to solving your problem. If there is a way that you can figure out how to explore your identity while staying in the relationship, that would be the way to go. However, you have to step back and be honest with yourself. Can you, as a person, find enough space outside of the relationship to have the time to explore new interests, experiment, and perhaps travel in order to discover new things about yourself, and your identity as a whole. 

Personally, I've found that it's very difficult to grow as an individual while I am in a relationship. I know that my personality prevents me from developing and learning things about myself when there's a significant other in my life. For the most part I believe that the issue is that it's very difficult to be fully independent while in a relationship, and  experiment with things without being judged by your partner. You might try something new, and it might freak your partner out. You also might fundamentally be changed as a person as a result of your experimentation, and that can eventually lead towards the end of the relationship. 

If I were you I would discuss this issue with your partner. Inform him that you want to explore yourself. Then, start taking steps towards making that exploration into reality, and see if your relationship changes - for the better or for the worse. This way you will avoid any regrets, and will figure out if you really belong with your partner. 

Ultimately, what I'm saying is that relationships that last eventually have to have the capacity to allow both individuals to evolve together. If you have noticed that you can no longer grow in this relationship, then it might be time to move on. "

But I think you're misunderstanding what Google is doing here.  This is not a simple deterministic computer program whose algorithms can be reverse engineered, code re-written, compiled and run on an ordinary computer.  Google is providing a service.

Google's self driving car is an AI trained with a technique called machine learning.  Machine learning is the process of showing the computer millions of examples of how to solve a particular problem, and the computer internally creates it's own non-human readable code millions of times, and constantly selects code that solves the problem the best.  Often times, machine learning algorithms allow for the dynamic segmentation of code, where fuzzy logical conditionals and non-deterministic control flow allow for multiple sets of instructions to be combined or compared in various different ways, on the fly.

The algorithms are run several times with different parameters of parallelism, computational space available, time available, and allowed executable size, so a series of interacting run time executable are generated that dynamically pass control to and from each other when simple cases are exhausted, or when complex procedures are observed to produce the same output as simple ones.  Some of these binaries are small enough to run on a calculator, others require massive mainframes or larger; such that (for binaries that correctly deal with complex cases) any other devices that need an answer to such complex cases must call for their output over the internet.

There is no source code.  All there is is incomprehensible machine language that was created by a process of training the computer with millions of hours of driving and supercomputer-years of analysis.  Like human intelligence, there is no human readable algorithm.  Only low-level abstractions like neural networks or raw data dumps are possible, aside from actually running it in the field.  For this to be open source, you would need a supercomputer that could process millions of hours of driving, and then you would also need to feed this supercomputer all that data for analysis and generation of the dynamic car-driving binaries.  Or a quantum computer (that might make this technology far cheaper to run).  But until then, the core self-driving-car system physically can not be open source."

I was starting to get really into reading, and I saw this book on my mom's book shelf of this pretty lady surrounded by these tiny dragons, and asked my mom if I could read it. I was about 7 or 8 at the time, so I was wanting to get past baby books and read something better. My mom, probably thinking I'd just read a couple pages and get bored, gave me the okay. 

I was *enthralled.* Despite the book being the second in a trilogy, I absolutely loved the book. I didn't get a lot of the more adult themes until I got older, but Menolly's interaction with her fire lizards and her struggles with the Harper school both charmed me and made my heart hurt for her. I identified with her to a level I never could in any of the books I read before, and when I put that book down I reached for another Pern book. 

That one book, probably the shortest novel in the Pern series, made me a reader. By the end of the year my reading speed and comprehension was beyond that of my classmates. It got to the point where some of the kids were bullying me because they thought I was just pretending to read, and that I couldn't actually read something like the massive hardcover Masterharper of Pern.

finalDraft_v012,nyc,1389561049.0,"Read the thing you linked and the comments, expecting it to make me hate her.  And it kinda made me just dislike the people ragging on her.  Just because someone wants to share their knowledge of nursing babies, that doesn't mean they have to give it for free - and according to the OP's NY Times article, she was charging $30.  Thirty bucks is NOTHING to Park Slope residents!  And like she mentioned in the Times article, the residents appear to only care for stuff if it's very expensive or free; $30 is too inbetween.  The pricing thing actually is a recognized psychological phenomenon in retail, so in a sense if the owner was a more savvy business owner....she would take that in to account and up her prices.  (EDIT: the phenomenon I'm talking about: new brands will price their stuff high, like release $500 purses, because it is then perceived by consumers to be something WORTH $500.)  Unfortunately, she didn't because that then goes against her personal ethics.  And her inability to get her ethics in line with profitability seems to have made her excruciatingly bitter.

I get it.  I grew up in the LES like she did.  I've passed her store so many times.  I live half my week in Park Slope since my boyfriend lives there.  I see the population she's dealing with.  She certainly shouldn't take it out on customers, if she were completely in control of her emotions...but really, who is?  What human can do that for 17+ years?  The ideal is you always have a smile on your face.  The reality is, people get tired and people get bitter.  There are a lot of should've would've could'ves for any situation, but it's all in hindsight.  I too would be pissed if people bought a $1000 baby product elsewhere and then brought it in to the store, asking for free advice.  And one shouldn't get pissy if the owner asks you for a fee for the knowledge, especially if you didn't buy that product she's helping you with at her store.

I feel shame enough if I try on stuff at a store, then order online elsewhere.  But bringing in the trophy of your elsewhere-shopping to a store after you bought it...that's kind of an asshole move.  I see why she sees them as entitled.

I'm glad to read on your linked article, however, that the Boing Boing owner says she is no longer bitter.  That's good on her.  I'm glad she finally reached a moment of catharsis.  She no longer feels like someone alone and drowning at sea."

In high school, an INTJ and I were constantly trying to outdo each other, on tests, on essays, on getting away with shenanigans, on honors, on college admissions. Later, it was who could get over exes fastest, earn the most degrees, achieve more in one summer, etc. 

It was just for fun, and yet it wasn't; I'm certain I pushed myself to do more, better with my time because of it, and ultimately achieved positions of greater influence than I would have sought on my own.

No judgement here. But most atheists I know get themselves into trouble because they actively try to start fights with people or say outlandish things that they know will get them in trouble. It's one thing to put yourself out there socially and push your own boundaries. It's another to do things that are completely anti-social in nature. 

I'm atheist. But I keep it to myself. I regularly speak with religious people about their religions and I respect their views. I live in VA, if that makes any difference. Everyone is Christian here. It doesn't bother me, and I don't bother them.

whatsweirdis,sex,1389561255.0,"My husband and I also experimented (I say this because we're not currently still doing it, however, we plan to get back into it) with soft swapping and sex clubs, and I am also bisexual like your wife. Although I don't know your relationship or anything about her I can only offer my experienced perspective as the woman in this situation.
    
Reading this I was immediately alarmed when you stated that they had went into the bedroom and your first response wasn't to see what was going on. Did you not want to see your wife being intimate with another woman? Were you uncomfortable? Or did she ask you prior to this for privacy and you agreed to it? There are some factors here you might want to look into further. 
    
However, she isn't 100% innocent in this either..I mean..you said over 2 hours they were playing? And not once did she come out to check on you? You did state that this is new to her, so perhaps if this was her first time fully experiencing a woman in bed maybe she got lost in the moment and was focusing solely on herself and the other woman. Perhaps she felt comfortable knowing it was just them and that you weren't there to participate. Or maybe she expected you to join, but figured after awhile that you choose not to, and didn't care to interrupt their play time with it.
    
I think the number one thing that has to be done when opening the door to a non-monogamous relationship is to establish communication. You need to be comfortable expressing your thoughts and feelings throughout this entire process. Know your boundaries and limits, and STOP if you feel uncomfortable with anything! NO ONE should force you into anything you arn't 100% on board with..including your wife! You two need to establish certain rules that you feel suit your needs right now as a couple..and if possibly some day you both feel you're ready for those rules to be broken then eliminate them..and if that day never happens, then don't stress about it! It's about having fun, not tearing apart relationships. 
    
When your wife gets back please talk to her and tell her the things you mentioned here. Let her know that you felt shut out and that the situation made you uncomfortable. If you're okay with her still playing with this woman, but want to be included then tell her so! If you just want to observe then mention that! Just make sure that she knows that you felt like she intentionally excluded you, how that made you feel, and what could be done to make yourself happy."

Git or SVN for version control. Bugzilla or Trac for bug/task tracking. Both are so much less annoying to use, and I'd argue that almost anything is better than TFS for version control. Even Microsoft agrees and is moving TFS's version control to Git in the upcoming versions.

You don't want different systems for every part. TFS will integrate much better in Visual Studio than any other software and you'll have every aspect of the life cycle management in one suite.

You keep using this word and nobody is challenging it, so I'm going to step up and have the semantic argument with you.

What is ""real""? You seem to assume that the flood of chemical neurological reactions that takes place in the soft, warm, squishy organic matter that makes up our brains is somehow inherently less arbitrary than a program's responses, electrical signals spiking across tiny silicon chips, but they are very similar in many ways. We both have ""coding""; our hard code, our DNA, is determined by millions of years of evolution that has given our brain an advanced structure, one which is mutable but still dictates that we have certain reactions in certain situations. Samantha's coding was written by humans, an intelligent selection process rather than a natural one, but it became clear she was capable of learning, absorbing information and adapting on a level that her creators could never have anticipated. So what makes her any less ""real"" than her flesh-and-blood counterparts?"

take your post and take out trans and put cis (just for clarity) and take out ""finally"" (because it doesn't make much sense with cis women.)   And maybe retitle it ""how does the existence of cis people (or just people) inform the distinction between sex and gender?""

What I'm getting at is that this question being pointed at trans women is cissexist.  

another thought puzzle:
I am a trans male. I would currently be extremely uncomfortable going out in public wearing a dress and stockings and heels. (some trans men wouldn't be uncomfortable garbed similarly, of course.)  I am not sure why, exactly, but guess what...hardly anyone would pose this hypothetical asking why that isn't sexist.  Isn't it absurdly sexist for a trans man to not want to wear ""women's clothes""?  Probably, but the truth is this scenario is lobbed by cis feminists towards trans women PARTICULARLY, and I couldn't begin to tease the cissexism out from what the base question is trying to ask.

bunker_man,changemyview,1389562171.0,"&gt;It seems like the effects of culture, which act on us even from before birth (babies just born already prefer the cadence of the language they have heard in the womb over other languages) are not taken into account by evo-psych. 

Err... this is more of a stereotype, and less of what it is actually like. The issue is that cultural differences and the human mind are not the most primal parts of humanity. And so while they are obviously important to study, it is only more recently that people began to realize that going down to the fundamental driving forces needs an evolutionary context in order to be fully understood. It's not enough to know that people actively think they want, or even what their subconscious wants. Evolutionary psychology is an attempt to take this further and merge it with biology: What is it that people's fundamental animalistic attributes are actually pushing them to do that gets transformed into human thought processes. The reason it may seem sketchy now is not that the field is fundamentally wrong in any way. It is merely that as an individual area of research it is still in it's infancy. So if you want it to get better, you need to advocate for it's enhancement, not try to discredit it.

&gt;I used to read a lot of feminist blogs, which had a low view of evo-psych.

By feminist you almost certainly mean postmodern feminist. Which leads to a problem. Postmodernists main issue with evolutionary psychology is not actually one that comes from a valid scientific critique. It is purely ideological. Postmodernists privilege what people THINK the meanings and attributes they associate with things are. And as such they find it inconvenient, and are very hostile to anything that makes it obvious that there are connotations beyond this. For example, if someone dresses up and goes out and claims they do not want attention... sometimes even if their human mind believes it does not, their animalistic tendencies ultimately do, and their dress may have been unknowingy chosen accordingly. And this is not only evolutionary psychologists that know this, but biologists, or psychologists in general. There are studies which show how people's unknown actions will reflect this. To a postmodernist, this fills them with rage, since they want what they claim the connotations of their actions are to be the end of the story. But it is not. This is ultimately the long and short of it. They don't like the field, since it is about areas of human interest that for ideological reasons they do not want to be known or able to be actively referenced. And yet they believe that as knowledge advances in these areas, it will open a can of worms that they simply wish to transform so unspeakable that no one ever will.'

In the end, evolutionary psychology is simply the next stage in the meeting of psychology and biology in general. So hostility against it is hostility against psychology itself. It is one thing to say that it being young may come upon mistakes: the same is true of all softer sciences. But this is no excuse to pretend that it's valid areas of interest should be ignored in favor of ideological reasons."

I'm really not sure if you can call the books 'fantasy,' now that I think about it. It takes place far into the future where humans colonized the planet, saw these cat-sized dragonlike animals (the fire lizards I mentioned) and used genetic engineering to make them into dragons to fight annoying weather patterns.

It'd be much harder to diagnose me these days because I've adapted so well that the only signs that I have a problem are massive stress and complete lack of social activity.

I'd be willing to bet that a woman at my age would be far more comfortable (and *capable*) of discussing her emotions and asking for help. I've had 'asking for help' beaten out of me by social roles. :/"

On top of the $20+ you already spent on it, because jeans aren't cheap, and neither are 'business' pants. Plus the time to get them hemmed. Plus the gas to get them hemmed. Plus the extra trip to pick them back up from getting them hemmed.

&gt;An inch or two off

Try six to eight.

&gt;If you don't have the money it's probably not even that difficult to do it yourself. 

Sure, if you have someone that can teach you, and if you have a sewing machine, which is also expensive. Not to mention the fact that the different cuts for the bottom of jeans require different ways of hemming them. (A boot cut, for example, is going to require a different technique than skinny jeans.)

Not going to use a sewing machine? How quickly can you pick up the art of stitching so that it comes out nice and even every time? Because I definitely don't want to worry about the possibility of RUINING the pants I already spent a non-trivial amount of money on. On top of the amount of personal time it also takes.

Just go in your basement or a garage for a little bit everyday and you will gain your tricks back, maybe even become better at them if you don't have to worry about a low ceiling.  I'm 6 foot tall and skating in the basement is kind of tough since the ceiling is around 7 feet with the rafters, so I'm limited in what I can do...  

I sucked at pop-shuvs in the summer though and I'm starting to get the motions down more and more, so the 20-30 min sessions definitely help.

I would do a lot of good skin care the week approaching the tat and then pray that you don't get any unfortunately placed pimples while slathered with goop afterwards. If you do, try popping them with sharp tweezers, or something similar, AWAY from the ink. If they are not on a line or anything then leave them be for the healing process. Good Luck."

I can compare it with a relatively recent example of the real world: Tlatelolco, Mexico, 1968. That year, numerous protests were happening all around the country. Teachers, workers, all kinds of people were against the current government, but they didn't care. Instead, the government attacked their children. In a pacific protest (if not the only pacific protest) organised by students, the government decided to put an example. [You can watch the rest for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw2KsKXrF5o). Never since that day the people have revolted. People is scared, not for themselves, but for their children. that's why the Hunger Games are successful: they appeal to what a person most fears. The fear that if you revolt, your children will pay the consequences, and thus you must keep it shut and obey. I'm sure Ms. Miller didn't see it.

Yes the CBD sucks but it is interesting to see new things constantly popping up.

Now we're seeing innovative funky new establishments popping up all the time and the old guard of Lion Nathan/DB controlled bars well gone.

Think of Jimi Hendrix, who played a right-hand Strat upside-down for most of his career. His clean tone is considerably different than any of his rightside-up Strat-using contemporaries, and that's because of the pickups being reversed, which brings out different frequencies and whatnot.

**The build you put together has particularly poor performance for the budget.**

* 4770k isn't going to give you an advantage in gaming.

* Premium corsair products are expensive compared to the competition (RAM &amp; PSU)

* The PRO isn't realistically better than the 840 EVO

* With the savings I swapped out the GTX 770 for the best GTX 780 available, it's not worth getting a 780 ti unless you can get an OC varient with an aftermarket HSF.

* Also, 4GB configured 760's &amp; 770's are snake oil.

* That case is ludicrously expensive, here's a higher quality case (Cool Master is a mediocre brand anyway, you don't spend $200 on a case covered with mesh panels)."

* I have duplicates of the same style of jeans in several sizes, because a 6, a 4, and an 8 can all fit me depending on the brand.

funkalunatic,classicalmusic,1389562977.0,"Temporal placement in Western/European/""classical"" musical tradition is very subjective and emotion-based. The relationship between the orchestra and conductor is typically moderated by feeling, tension and release, give and take, push and pull, rather than a rigid hierarchical notion that the tempo is dictated by the conductor and that the sound coming out of your instrument needs to articulate at the precise moment that the baton reaches its lowest level. More realistically, the dynamic is more complex. The conductor signals a beat, and the orchestra releases the sound in accordance with its own emotional reaction to the conductor's action. Likewise, the conductor is often placing the beat in anticipation of this emotional response, and may place it early (or late) to create an instant of anxiety within the orchestra (that will emerge in the music), but with the anticipation that the orchestra will respond in a certain way and play it at the desirable time."

Omegaile,estimation,1389563003.0,"I'll assume that parking lots means everywhere you usually park your car (your house, side if the street, a paying garage). I estimate about 8m^2 of parking space per lot. Also each there are more parking lots than cars, as you leave a empty space at home and park your car elsewhere. But not much more, less than double. So I'd say 1.5 parking lots per car.

Now what's an average city? I'll just assume that the city has 1000 people/km^2. And if they have lots of cars they have 1 car per 2 people.

So it adds up to 1000 * 1/2 * 8 * 1.5 = 6000 m^2 /km^2 = 0.6%.

Obviously with some of those, especially T, you have to think of the other effects. You can't choose to take T just enough to grow a beard but not enough to grow body hair.

That being said it's unlikely that you *did* cause harm, but there is a very real danger involved in taking drugs, especially at a young age.  It might not be a fun thing to hear but adolescent drug use is inherently riskier from a neurological standpoint.  Plenty of people do drugs at a young age and suffer no ill consequences, but that will be a small consolation if *you* are one of the unlucky ones.

These people have no chance to hear the true message of Christ. and yet these people may live wonderfully good lives, doing all the things a good Christian would do. 

Is God going to send these good people to hell because they were born in the wrong part of the world?

But in terms of other women, I can see why that happens.  Extroverts and their associated personalities are most DEFINITELY valued in our society; read a book recently that expanded a lot on how our society loves extroverts yet needs introverts.  Book was called ""Quiet"" (check it out, pretty fast read).  Good on you for moving on from these women.  A socially adept introvert can be rare, and in my opinion have the best of both worlds."

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1389563266.0,"&gt;The EU ""allows"" members to quit, there's even a provision in the Lisbon treaty

That's why countries join EU, otherwise none would. I don't think UK gave full rights of leaving UK to Irish and Scottish straight away.

&gt; UK parliament decisions don't ""interfere with everything"" also (Scots have their own legal system and there are the various devolved assemblies)

I haven't looked at topic in details but am pretty sure those laws were added in time. Not like  from the very beginning.

&gt; No you've miss understood, UKIP (a pretty much single issue party) are widely predicted to win the coming European election. Their sheer performance in the Locals last year has forced the main three parties to become more eurosceptic, a UKIP first place will bring more support for a referendum from the main parties.

Current polls don't really give a certain win to UKIP in any elections.

&gt;Euroscepticism is not confined to either side of the political spectrum.

In Farage's view it is only one sided.

&gt;Look you're new to this country so I'll explain it to you: Labour are weak minded vote grabbers. They've already gone eurosceptic following the UKIP performance in the locals last year. If UKIP do well then they'll offer a referendum. The Conservatives are offering one, the Lib Dems offered one the last time around so it can be assumed they'll offer one again. Ed Milliband has already stated that they'll offer one if there are any future treaty changes and luckily enough there are rumblings on the continent that a new treaty is needed as a response to the financial crisis. It isn't a stretch for them to offer one following a strong UKIP performance.

Haha. I would say most parties are vote grabbing people (look Conservatives, look UKIP). Obviously it's hard to predict whether Labour will or not give a referendum. I'm more keen on observing the voting predictions. They will not say anything about referendum unless they start significantly loosing possible votes. So far they only gained.

&gt;It's just a referendum, why do you fear democracy? Why don't you want the people to have a say?

Referendum is obviously a good thing and I think UK should eventually have EU referendum if big numbers of people actually want it. I just don't think it should be done now. Why? Simply because average citizens and voters are emotional. They are not specialists in the field of economy and similar. They will vote EU referendum now with hearts, rather than minds. If UK quits EU it's pretty permanent, meaning this decision will have a huge future impact. Also, I think it's better to be even in a bit worse situation but knowing how bad it is, rather than go fully open and risk a lot (possibly gain but not much). 

Why UK wants a referendum coincidentally where there is a world's crisis? Because plenty of people blame EU and although EU could have been somehow responsible for it, it's well proven that it was a banking crisis (started in USA) which started whole crisis chain. Quitting EU now is not much different from crime in passion (where with most such crimes people are sure about the other person's fault - EU fault is not established here).

P.S. I personally don't care that much about it as opposed to UK nationals I will have both UK and EU passports, meaning I won't be restricted with most of the things Brits risk to lose. As I think of UK now as my country I think though that the light decision of quitting EU is generally bad for UK and that is where I make my case."

IWishIWasAShoe,Gothenburg,1389563546.0,"When studying I spent about 1000-1500 kr every month on food, mainly at ICA. My rent was cheap so I didn't live particularly frugal and bought more or less whatever I wanted to eat, short loin, port and whatever.

Still, general rules applies. Buy the cheapest brands/brand-less with sufficient quality. Always check the ""per kilo"" price (jÃ¤mfÃ¶rspris) and buy the cheapest, freeze stuff. Ground meat in particular is great, most stores will do drives on meat from Ireland for 39kr/kg from time to time so buy it, and repackage it at home in 400-800g packages and stuff it in the freezer! Remember that noodles may seem cheap but are expensive as shit. Not all big packages are cheaper though, so always check the price tag.

Most stores have discount/member cards get them early to earn points and get additional discounts.

Also, no matter how much you save on food, if you go around spending money on a whole lot of useless stuff you'll still have a hard time.

TL;DR: Yes, you should be able to live on 1000 SEK if you plan your meals, buy in bulk and freeze stuff, but if you're able to save on something else and put a few hundred more on food that'd be great."

winewagens,beetle,1389563570.0,"This is a condensed version of how my life, my father's barn, and his vineyard were successively overtaken by VWs:


71 bug:  My older sister got a 1967 bug when she was in college and I was in high school.  Needless to say our dad and I learned how to fix it, but major issues were brought to a local shop.  Then my future brother in law saw a 1971 bug for sale on his way home from work when I was 16.  We bought it to paint and flip.  It's still around 10 years later.  She and her family got a 1973 super two or so years later.

70 bus:  The local VW club is mainly buses, so I wanted a bus when I was in college.  I poked around on CL, thesamba, and other places for awhile.  I made a joke about one on CL during my second year of undergrad.  The bus was an hour from school, but around three from home.  Thanksgiving rolled around and the price had kept dropping because the owner was frustrated installing glass.  I got some photos and when the price hit a decent number the Friday after Turkey day we looked at it and towed a solid, freshly painted green and white 1970 bus home because there was no windshield.  After 6 or so months the interior and glass was all installed by club friends with VW businesses.

71 westy:  There were intervening project bugs including a 58 bug and 66 bug that I sold off to fund other purchases due to no time or welding ability.  These funded a 1971 westy I saw on CL and missed, then saw it again a few months later for more money, even further away.  I paid a deposit on it while another guy was on the phone with the owner trying to come look at it.  This was during the fall of my last year of undergrad.  The engine wound up being junk, so I built one with good used parts from my stash at the local shop mentioned above.  I took a year off from my education and learned from him, then moved away for grad school.  He's no longer with us due to an accident.  

68 westy #1:  During the summer of 2012 my friend/mentor at the shop passed away.  About a month later my parents were visiting relatives out of state and one of my grandma's neighbors said something about a bus.  After talking to the owner (a friend from my grandma's church) and getting some photos I wound up buying it as a therapy project of sorts.  The only thing it's missing is the icebox, which I already had in the barn.  The fun part was I had to enlist some other relatives for storage at their house 1000 miles away, then arrange for my parents to trailer it home for me.

67 bug:  I was looking around on eBay for parts where I live now and saw it.  The paint was horrible from a PO strip job.  The seller was moving and had to sell it.  It took forever to hear back, but we finally got in touch.  I looked at it, then bought it as a gift for my mother.  I drove it around this summer for awhile.  It made the 800 mile trip to their house behind their SUV, only getting 3mpg less going home than coming to see me this past fall.

68 westy #2:  A friend from the VW club was taking a detour this past fall back home and saw it maybe 2 miles from my parents' house.  I'd never seen it before, which is strange for me.  He talked to the guy, made an offer and he thought about it.  My friend told me about the bus but couldn't recall specifics of where it was when I was home for Christmas.  We drove around and finally found it but nobody was home.  The next day I bought some repair panels for the other bus from a fellow club member and the dude was home!  I made him an offer, he kept the engine (I have spares), and I picked it up with my friend's trailer and the help of the dude's neighbor's tractor.

70 westy:  This thing sat at my mentor's shop forever.  It had been there probably 10 years or more.  He had rebuilt the engine recently, the owner paid but never picked up the bus, he ""stored"" it at the shop in essence after he moved west.  My mentor gave me flack about that engine when we were building mine quite a bit.  In 2012 he passed a week and a half after I saw him on vacation, the shop was closed and nobody knew how to reach the owner of the bus.  I told the friends who were working on taking care of everything about a mutual friend who knew the owner.  The mutual friend wound up paying the fees and babysitting the bus while the owner still pretty much disappeared, ah well.  I've talked to him a few times, he thinks the bus can be saved, but really it's not roadworthy without a ton of work.  This past August I saw the mutual friend and we all worked out a way for me to buy the bus.  Christmas came, I went home and bought it, looking exactly as I had seen it the last time.

The engine my mentor built will be going into 68 westy #1, the interior will go to 68 westy #2, and the shell will become a bar in my dad's vineyard.

As a med student you're surely familiar with the Koch postulates of infectious disease, and you might have learned a little bit about the Hill criteria which is another way, used by epidemiologists, of not only defining a disease but also attributing causation to it.

Psychiatry could also be called the part of medicine that deals with 'behavioral disease'.  The psychiatrists of the APA have hemmed and hawed this by including a line you see at the bottom of so many the DSM checklists:  ""..clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.""  ([Here's an article about that line, why it exists, and its drawbacks.](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/3707/1856.pdf))

The UCBerkeleian trend that ""the personal is political"" has arisen in part because of the increasing trend to authoritativize, to medicalize, to governmentalize more and more of human life.  Checklists and flowcharts and education and ticking off boxes - what Foucault would have called a panoptic approach to management of the citizenry - runs rampant these days.  Folks who want to have a gender reassignment procedure want to feel better afterwards - and indeed many of them do. 

A plastic surgeon I spoke to once told me his field was ""the healing of difficult wounds,"" including, say, burns; but also, including psychic wounds: like the ones received when a person looks in the mirror and sees someone of the wrong gender.  Hard to argue with that.

Scarcer,buildapc,1389563749.0,"&gt;The 780ti actually overclocks quite well with the stock cooler. 

This is a matter of opinion, but you're paying over $150 more for a marginal stock performance improvement vs an OC/HSF 780, and a blower style cooler which are particularly noisy. Factory overclocked 780's can be further OC'd as well.

&gt;And from personal experience that case is built like a tank.

Cool Master uses almost exclusively metal when building the frames of their cases, and just about everything else, too much in fact; what's not accented with plastic is simply covered in mesh. Any decent case approaching $100 has a metal frame and features to boot.

IndignantChubbs,politics,1389563795.0,"Yeah okay, let's look at these claims one by one. Before, though, let's note that you made up that 'just as bad' quote. I didn't say that. I said that some sectors of society have improved somewhat, but the society is still in a miserable state of affairs. Quote people accurately. You caricatured my opinion from the get-go, and so you're more interested in attacking and ""winning"" the argument than you are in having a conversation. I don't think things are just as bad today as they were under Taliban rule; I also don't think the situation there today is as rosy as the American government would like to pain it.

First, the government's accountability and level of democracy. According to [this report](http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Programs/foreign%20policy/afghanistan%20index/index20120930.pdf) published by the Brookings Institution, Afghanistan:

* ranks 180th (out of 182) in corruption, which is actually down from 117th in 2005
* ranks 150th (out of 179) in press freedom, down from 104th in 2002
* 69% of Afghans are somewhat/very satisfied with how democracy works in Afghanistan, 29% are somewhat/very unsatisfied
* 46% of Afghans think things are going in the right direction, 35% in the wrong direction (it was 44/21 in 2006, the earliest year numbers are available)

So while the Afghans view the changes in government favorably, which in the context of who ruled them previously is predictable, the government is about as democratic as Iran and extremely corrupt, almost the most corrupt in the world.

Medicine and education: 

* 57% of Afghans said availability of medical care was very/quite good, 42% said it was very/quite bad
* Infant mortality rates have dropped from 165 to 77 from 2003 to 2010, life expectancy has climbed from 42 for men and women to 62 for men and 64 for women
* In 2003 two million students were enrolled in school, in 2011 it was eight million
* 73% of Afghans deem education availability for children very/quite good, 27% call it very/quite bad

So, plenty of good news in these sectors. The health system is still shitty but is improving a lot, and an education system is in place and growing. These are important accomplishments.

Law:
Hard to find much information in this area. A legal system is developing, and the prison population has gone from 4000 to 18,000; without knowing how competent the system is, however, it's hard to judge that statistic. Opium production has grown enormously, approximately doubling since the invasion, and that's obviously a dangerous situation. 

Economy:

* 31% of Afghans say availability of jobs is very/quite good, 70% say it's very/quite bad
* 44% say their family is more prosperous now compared to under the Taliban, 34% say their family is less prosperous (it was 54/26 in 2006)

Those statistics are alarming. Afghanistan is deeply impoverished and barely any less so than under Taliban rule. There's been growth, but it's mostly flowed into the pockets of the corrupt elites who we bought off to win our war. You should read the article just posted; the social structure is oppressive and the economic situation untenable. 

So, to sum up, we were right in saying that there has been some real improvements in some aspects of Afghan society. But I think it is an exaggeration to say that for a ""vast"" number of Afghans their quality of life has increased enormously. Almost every Afghan is still in deep poverty, which is the most important factor in quality of life. The prospects for development aren't great due to the weakness of the corrupt government. And the whole matter of the Taliban still has to be dealt with, which is going to require some kind of reconciliation, and I dunno how that's gonna happen. Hopefully, the gains that have been made can be sustained, but I think the prospects aren't encouraging."

**1. Intro - Prologue** is beautiful.  Without looking at the composer credits, I knew Jinyoung did this one.  4.5/5

**2. Lonely** was the perfect choice for the promotional track; it's not my favorite but I think it's a good representation of the album.  4/5

**3. ì¬ë ê·¸ë** Sandeul's voice adkdnsoifhsdk.  Has a very nice chorus, too.  4/5

**4. Amazing** One of my favorites on the album.  Love every bit of it. 5/5

**5. Baby** Dat guitar and Baro saved this song from being boring.  3.5/5

**6. Oh My God** Engrish...the Engrish...but the chorus is ridiculously good.  5/5

**7. ë²ì°¨** Beautiful duet, reminds me of Junsu's stuff.  The beginning is meh, but it gets so much better in the second half.  Probably my favorite ballad this year (so far!) 4.5/5

**8. ìë»** Jinyoung working his magic again- this guy is one of my favorite idol composers.  4/5

**9. Who Am I** is my favorite song on the album.  It's so, so good and I would be satisfied if this was the only thing released by B1A4 during this promotion.  5/5

**10. ììì ì·¨í´** CNU!!! (my favorite member, tied with Sandeul)  Once again, a song with guitars that saves it from being a meh track.  CNU's English pronunciation could be better, but it's the best English on this release.  Good on you, CNU.  3.5/5

**11. ê¸¸** Another fantastic song- B1A4 is on a roll.  4.5/5

**12. Seoul** is my least favorite song on the album, and I'm sad they chose it as the last track (I would have switched it around with the previous song to end the album on a high note).  2.5/5

4.2/5! B1A4 just keeps getting better.  I think they've carved out a good niche in the idol world.

This album is what I think a One Direction collaboration with Busker Busker would sound like.

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1389563880.0,"Does anyone (i.e. parents) claim you as a dependent?  If not, you can claim yourself as one, usually.  

""Back taxes"" is actually a term for paying taxes from previous years.  Will you have to pay a tax bill? Maybe-- it depends on whether your withholding (which was calculated when you got your job, you filled out a form W-4) amount is greater than your earnings.  Usually they get this number wrong if you tell them the wrong number of dependents, you explicitly tell them a wrong number to withhold, or if you changed jobs with substantially different earnings.

Your form W2 is owed to you by your employer on or by Jan 31. Do yourself a favor and do your taxes right away; it'll give you more time to pay if you do owe (penalties for late payments don't start until April 15), and everything processes faster if you file early.  Filing at the deadline makes for a logjam.  You're probably filing form 1040EZ (which is for people without any complicated income sources), and you can probably file for free online (Federal only).  You'll have to file state taxes as well, and I don't know how AZ handles that.

I know it's nice to get a fat refund check  at the start of the year, but that's money that you earned months ago that you loaned to the government, interest-free. If that conflicts with your principles, you might consider adjusting your W4 so you either have to either pay at little or get a minimal return.

I'm not your tax advisor or an accountant, but I did a back-of-the-envelope calculation that you probably are going to pay around $3100 in Federal taxes, but remember, most of this should've been taken out of your paychecks at a rate of somewhere around $260/month.  (around half that per-paycheck, most likely).

Above all, there are lots of places to get help; whatever you do, don't let this build into a source of anxiety. Taxes are stressful when they're complicated, but yours are not complicated. 

P.S. Don't go to H&amp;R Block, don't take any advance loans on your refund (the interest rates are crazy). You're going to do this every year for the rest of your life, so learn it now as best you can, and learn to ask for or hire help when you can't."

Rabbis Speech TLl;DR

The Manna fell for the Jews. The importance of the manna is that the Jews depended on God for their daily sustenance. Several pieces of midrashic literature talk about the manna and specifics about it. For example, you only had the first third of the day to collect it before it is gone. But why did the manna have to fall at all? Why couldn't it appear as food in their tents?

The lesson is that God meets us halfway. God says ""I will gladly provide for you, but you have to do your half the job"".

But my Rabbi then presents another piece of midrashic literature. That some people just sometimes didn't get the manna. They overslept, they were lazy, didn't matter the reason. They never got the manna. So what food did they have? This piece says that the Jews set up a fund, a charity pool, to give their manna to the ones who for whatever reason, good or bad, got to eat.

Just as God showed mercy on the Jews by just giving them manna without expecting anything back, even though the Jews complained time after time, we need to show that same mercy towards each other."

OCPD has nothing to do with obsessions or compulsions; people with OCPD do not experience dysfunctional obsessions or compulsions unless they also have comorbid OCD, which they almost never do.  OCPD was originally named for historical reasons that don't make a lot of sense.  Interestingly, personality-disorded patients almost as a rule have poor insight into the way their disorder affects their functioning; it's far more apparent to others.

The DSM-V renames OCPD to 'anankastic personality disorder', partly to clear up this confusion.  Anankastic personality disorder is another bad name that doesn't make a lot of sense."

I know no one likes being an experiment but, when I was in a place where I just wanted casual sex, I didn't mind and I'm probably not the only woman who feels that way.

Though Smaug is considerably larger than the dragons the dragonborn is used to fighting and even Alduin. 

Lets just cop out and say this dragon born raised his alchemy to make enchanting potions and used his temporarily increased enchanting skill to make better items for potion making then he procceded to make even stronger enchanting potions. He repeats this process until he has three sets of armour one for blacksmithing, one for enchanting, and one for alchemy. His items are beyond the ken of any NPC's in skyrim and even the dwarves of the tolkeinverse and he can could easily oneshot Alduin at this point. He meets Smaug and fires an arrow from his mighty bow that deals 3000dmg and an additonal 500cold dmg on hit with and absorbs 250 stamina.

I have a very close relationship with my mother, which is not surprising since it was just her and me for many years.  My mom and I grew apart in my twenties, because I was making my own life, but she got breast cancer a few years ago and I took a year off work (I'm a writer, so it wasn't hard) to help her with the endless doctor visits, shopping, things like that.  She was *very* sick during the worst of the chemo.  We started having breakfast every Sunday morning, just in case she didn't make it, and when she got better (five years free!) we just kept doing it.

Now to answer your question....I'm 26, and a late bloomer.  Classmates got their boobs in like 6th grade, I didn't till I was in high school (age 13).  I'd say I hit my peak height of 5'2"" (well technically I am 5'1"" and 3/4) around age 14, and my feet also stopped growing. They're about a 7, but sometimes an 8 if a particular shoe is too narrow.  I've heard a rumor that your height stops growing up to 2 years after your first period, but I dunno if that's really true.

Weight, I was very light compared to classmates growing up.  They weighed us every year in school; while my classmates were in the 80s, I would be mid-40's.  While they were hitting 100, I would be in the 70s.  During high school I was ~88lb, and I loved that number.  In college I eventually got to the 104lb range that is now normal for me, and I feel great.  I don't look too skinny; people used to tease me about being a stick.

Now for **BREASTS**...which is really the answer you were looking for!!!

They started growing when I was 13, and did *most* of their growing during the first 2 years of high school.  I'd say that was probably....age 13-15 for me.  I had 32A's.  Through the rest of high school and college, I never noticed any grownth at all, and I thought that was it.  This upset me for some time, but (and this will sound shallow), after dating some guys who loved my body, I learned to love it too.  Now...when I was around 23-25.....I realized my 32A bras were not cutting it anymore.  I was popping out of them if I moved my arms around.  So I started researching online about that, got fitted for a bra at a nice lingerie shop, and found that I felt better in  30C/D bras (brands and padding still make my number a little different).  Even my boyfriend has commented that my breasts seem a little larger than when we first got together.

It was not a drastic change, but I do appreciate the extra meat they have now.  Nothing compared to someone who's a 34C.  But they look good on me, and I'm sure yours look good on you."

Well, you've just shown what you know about child support, which is apparently nothing.  [Here's a representative calculator](https://www.cse.ca.gov/ChildSupport/cse/guidelineCalculator#) for the State of California.  The process of determination is mechanical and relies mainly on income.  While the court has discretion in the final determination it is almost never utilized, as the State requires that uniform calculations be applied in all cases.

The rest of your argument is fine - I happen to agree with it - but let's not pretend that it's about justice.  Children all deserve a better life, and they deserve it equally.  However, children of poor fathers, and wealthy absentee fathers, are penalized disproportionately under this system relative to their cohorts.

As for radical change: radical change is needed from the one side that has the power in the dispute, Israel. They are the ones that can stop annexing territory, stop defending extremist terrorists (i.e. settlers, who were called terrorists a few days ago by a high Israeli official) who live on Palestinian land, stop the siege of Gaza. What can the Palestinians do? What you'll say: refrain from terrorism. I'd like them to, okay, but that's demanding that until they just sit passively and watch Israel destroy their hopes for a future, they don't deserve an end to their oppression. I wish Hamas didn't lob rockets, but the fact of the matter is Palestine is not the aggressor here; Israel is. Israel (and the United States, who permits this all to continue and supports Israel with unprecedented diplomatic and military aid) is the only actor here who can put an end to this, and so they are the ones who must be pushed to do so.

screenmagnet,relationships,1389564428.0,"The difference between 'indefinite remission' and 'cured' is semantic.
A personality disorder is a pervasive, maladaptive pattern of behaviour, thoughts, and feelings in response to stress. Sure, you can have a temporary, spontaneous remission of symptoms - most often in response to a reduction in stress or an improved level of social support. That is not a cure, and yes, the symptoms will return if the stress returns, or the person loses their support system. This is because no work has been done to change how the person responds to and copes with stressful situations.

I have done 10 years of biweekly individual therapy (roughly 250 sessions lasting 45 minutes), CBT groups, DBT groups, family therapy, couples therapy, self hypnosis, and read countless books and workbooks about BPD. Through all this work, I have actually changed core maladaptive beliefs, fallacious thought patterns, ego defences, and coping methods. I have developed better skills for coping with intense and unpleasant emotions. I have changed the way that I behave in response to stressful situations. I have developed techniques for introspection, impulse control, emotional regulation, effective communication, mindfulness, and relaxation. I have identified my triggers and know how to recognize them before things get out of hand.

I react to the same stressful situations with different thoughts, feelings, and emotions than before. Not only that, but due to the wonders of brain plasticity, my neural connections are now altered such that I perceive the same external situations in a way that is inherently less stressful to begin with.

Therefore, I no longer think, feel, behave, or even perceive things the way that a person with borderline personality disorder does, and it is extremely unlikely that I ever will again. If that's not a cure -- what is?

As to psychiatrists doing talk therapy -- yes, some do. Keep in mind that I have several comorbid psychiatric disorders that require treatment by a psychiatrist anyway (OCD, ADHD, Tourette's, trichotillomania, generalized anxiety disorder, and bipolar). I was originally referred to my youth psychiatrist at the age of 12 because of Tourette's, OCD, anorexia, and severe depression. Due to my various comorbidities, I have always been a fairly complex and unique case, and the clinical psychologists I saw did not feel comfortable being my primary mental health provider. My psychiatrist is a professor at a teaching hospital, who specializes in psychotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders, so she had the expertise to combine medications with intensive talk therapy.

I have met and worked with other psychiatrists who have an interest in psychotherapy as well. It is a mandatory part of their residency training where I live."

I want to ask for a tubal but apparently the doctors here won't do it unless you've already had kids. My friends sister wanted one after her first child, but they wouldn't do it. Two more kids later, they finally agreed to it when her last child was born c-section.

The media have given a voice to the opponents of strict laws and I thought most people agreed with that. I think we are now seeing what people actually want. It helps that many people don't understand what asylum really is and think asylum seekers are the same as immigrants. 

As for Crombez, he is not as popular as De Block even though he is definitely charismatic. But his big problem is his rhetoric, his ideology. He talks about fighting fraud but most of the changes to the fiscal system actually hurt regular people. He is the face of the fiscal approach of this government, so he gets the blame, even when it's not his department. 

In the minds of the public, De Block stands for strict laws on immigration. In the minds of the public, Crombez stands for higher taxes.

Misanthropy-Divine,AskMen,1389564569.0,"I used to. When I was in high school, I'd put on about 20 pounds per year like clockwork. Which was fine, except I stopped growing in height my sophomore year of high school, and I wasn't putting on all that much muscle. At my peak (going into my final semester senior year), I was 5'7"" and weighed a chunky 190. My haircut didn't help matters, nor did my overly-pale complexion (thank you genetics).

Once I changed my diet and started running and working out, that managed to drop to a much better 150 in a few weeks' time (my first 10 pounds were shed in a week's time). I also started growing my hair out, and it turns out that I'm one of those guys that looks *much* better with long hair. So now, I'm a little guy (5'7"" and 140 lbs. -- I'm pretty sure I'm done growing at this point) that looks like a rockstar. I don't do much heavy lifting, but I do lift some, as well as run and do some yoga.

the performance is another aspect. By getting on stage and performing, you're already doing something that at least half of everybody else cannot and will not do. Put on a hell of a show and make people remember you. Be larger than life and memorable.

Yeah, there are shitty customers everywhere and I would actually assume that Park Slope customers, while entitled, would not be as bad as ghetto customers.  I used to do retail in a ghetto area and God, why were people trying to haggle with me and shortchange me all the time?!  Very stressful environment.  That should at least be more rare with Park Slope clientelle.

So, I have not read all the yelp reviews on her store or anything.  But based off the article, it sounds like she was the one doing most of the interacting, and that coupled with her horrid homelife and financial crisis, with her ethical turmoil, she became a bitter and abrasive person.  It makes her understandable, but I don't mean to say her actions are excusable. I, for one, think it's inexcusable that she doesn't have a working website!

You're right that capitalism does incentivize waste that doesn't need to be there. Still though, I don't think scarcity is avoidable. I mean, think about the enormity of resources that would be necessary to provide everyone with what I think we can agree is a reasonable existence. The plumbing for fresh water delivery all over the world, the metal for washing machines and refrigerators, cars and other means of transportation, ovens, etc. Billions of people live on a dollar a day; imagine providing all that for them. Even if they don't live as luxuriously as we do in America, or even as luxuriously as people do in Denmark, we're still talking about an increase in consumption bigger than any in human history. How do we do that without confronting constraints? 

Furthermore, what about luxuries? Most people I know really like their laptops and their cell phones and wouldn't sacrifice those objects easily. Are they just going to decide that they don't want them anymore? I doubt it. If they don't, how are we going to tell the billions of people on Earth that those things are not for them? What about comfy couches, or nice cars? Desire for luxury goods will not disappear, at least not in the foreseeable future. We can't know for sure, but those desires are probably here to stay. We can't satisfy them all, so what's the answer? 

I think you can come up with at least partial answers to these problems. The first step, though, is acknowledging that they exist."

lana-del-boy,sex,1389564951.0,"I had the best sex of my life last night. No hyperbole, it was just...incredible.

Ma and my boyfriend were reunited for the first time since New Years, when we'd jokingly discussed buying some parody-porn. So I surprised him with a copy of Star Whores.

We'd been snapchatting the night before, sending dirty pics and videos, including an incredibly hot one of him coming. So, understandably, we were pretty worked up. But we decided that we were going to time our sex with Star Whores (which is 70 minutes long.)

It took me about 10 minutes to put the DVD in, since he kept kissing and groping me, and I kept giving his dick cheeky little sucks and kisses and licks. Finally though, the DVD was in, and we started.

Like I said before, it was amazing. We had to stop halfway through because he came close to coming as I was blowing him, but after a couple of minutes he was good to go. We kept laughing during sex, because of all the corny lines in Star Whores (""we need to gather the earth-woman's quim juice"") but after a while we were so into it that we forgot about the DVD.

I asked him to talk dirty towards the end, and he really went for it. At this point I'd lost count of my orgasms, but I'd had at least 5. He was pinning me down, pulling my hair, biting me, calling me his little slut, choking me, slapping my face and bum...then holding me close, kissing me everywhere, and groaning my name. Shit was hot. He put my legs up on his shoulders, which he knows makes my orgasms like 20 times more intense, and then went hard. SO GOOD.

Finally, after as Star Whores was drawing to a close and I was literally quivering from pleasure, I went down on him until he came in my mouth. Then we just sort of lay in shock as the credits rolled. 

I told him it was the best sex I'd ever had, and he said that it was the same for him.

My boyfriend has one of those non-Tempurpedic memory foam mattresses...it's really kind of crap.  Hurts your back even if no one else is on it.  We try to cuddle but cannot fall asleep in that position there.

I have a firm spring mattress, which is great when sleeping on your back...but not so great for your side. And if you snuggle, you're probably on your side.  It's okay if he's on his back and I'm on his shoulder.

Recently, we stayed at his parents' home and they had a firm spring mattress with a memory foam topper.  This combination was PERFECT!!  We would fall asleep hugging face to face, spooning, whatever, and sleep the entire night.  It's all about the bed!"

SirNuke,linux_gaming,1389565237.0,"The answer is maybe.  The relevant part of the Steam TOS:

&gt; G. Restrictions on Use of Software
&gt; 
&gt; You may not use the Software for any purpose other than the permitted access to Steam and your Subscriptions, and to make personal, non-commercial use of your Subscriptions, except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement or applicable Subscription Terms. Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use), or under applicable law notwithstanding these restrictions, you may not, in whole or in part, copy, photocopy, reproduce, publish, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify, disassemble, decompile, create derivative works based on, or remove any proprietary notices or labels from the Software or any software accessed via Steam without the prior consent, in writing, of Valve.
&gt;
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; You are entitled to use the Software for your own personal use, but you are not entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Software to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Software to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use); (ii) host or provide matchmaking services for the Software or emulate or redirect the communication protocols used by Valve in any network feature of the Software, through protocol emulation, tunneling, modifying or adding components to the Software, use of a utility program or any other techniques now known or hereafter developed, for any purpose including, but not limited to network play over the Internet, network play utilizing commercial or non-commercial gaming networks or as part of content aggregation networks, websites or services, without the prior written consent of Valve; or (iii) exploit the Software or any of its parts for any commercial purpose, except as expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use).

It may be considered a derivative work based on Steam, depending on how exactly you define things.  The API itself is very, very public and it's not really implementing any of the Steamworks functionality.  The second section focuses on modifying the various Steam network protocols (which aren't touched), but while this project doesn't really affect networking protocols themselves, certain interpretations might be trouble.

The SDK's documentation has the following (which I haven't agreed to and haven't read any of their documentation so far):

&gt; 2.4 No reverse engineering. Licensee will not take any steps to reverse engineer the functionality of the SDK or develop software to replace the SDK's functionality. If Licensee develops software to interact with the Steamworks Services, such software shall not communicate with the Steamworks Services directly but always through the application programming interface (API) provided by the SDK Redistributables.	

Which, I'm not sure about, either.  It's more of an extension of the existing Steamworks API in my mind.  Writing code that binds the Steamwork APIs to another language would almost certainly allowed, and I consider that along the (legal, technical, moral) lines of a WINE-&gt;Linux Steam Client API.

Valve's publicly accessible SDK source [is very openly licensed](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/LICENSE) and would clearly allow this project."

Lift progressively heavier things 3-4 times a week.

The problem is, this is hard when you are thin and aren't used to eating 3000+ calories a day. So, people write out essays that might help with find the best way to lift progressively heavier things and eat more =)  Gaining, just like losing, is not easy for a lot of people.  IMHO it's actually a lot harder to force feed yourself and gain than it is to eat less and not.  And by that I mean it's fucking hard to gain 5 pounds force feeding yourself."

You first said that the person probably doesn't care that the money is going to conservation efforts.  That is most likely wrong.  Yes, there are some asshole hunters who hunt just for the joy of killing animals.  Contrary to popular belief (thanks to Ace Ventura, etc.), these are the minorities.  Most hunters (myself and all the hunters I know) actually care about the conservation of animals.  Hunting prevents overpopulation and helps animal species thrive.  Now I realize that the rhino population is nowhere near overpopulation, but hunting this animal will help the black rhino species thrive.

The person did not decide that the best was to conserve these animals was ""killing one of them.""  They saw that they had the opportunity to fulfill one of their life-long dreams of going on a big game hunt AND help an endangered species.  That is why they bid."

I feel like that puts it in a different category than most mental illnesses. Therapy isn't successfully used to treat the cause of people seeking reassignment surgery. Non-hormonal medication isn't used to treat it either. Only surgery and hormones are. That seems to make it more physiological than psychological."

ankylosaurus_rex,ABraThatFits,1389565617.0,"I think you have shallow boobs, and that your cups are much too small.  

The Freya Ginny is *not* shallow breast friendly - the cups are too deep.  What you've got going on with the Ginny is some textbook Orange-in-a-Glass.  I wouldn't bother with this bra (or any of Freya's three-part unlined balconettes).

The Cleo Juna *is* a shallow friendly bra, but you've definitely got it in much too small a cup size.  If you're willing to try this bra again, I'd give it a shot in 28E or even 28F.  This bra, though, maybe be *too* shallow for you.  Is the underwire sitting directly in your inframammary fold, or is it a cm or two below the fold?

The Curvy Kate looks like you're on the right track, but again you have too small a cup.  Again, if you're willing to try this bra again, I'd return it and try for a 28DD or 28E.  I'm not super familiar with this bra, but reviews on Bratabase indicate that this bra is a bit wide and a bit shallow.  Several reviews also indicated that they had a hard time keeping their armpit tissue in the cups.

So I think you are slightly shallow and moderately wide.  Try the Juna in 28E and the CK in 28DD.  If you want another bra to try, give the Cleo Lucy in 28DD or 28E a shot."

Keep in mind that Open Vld joined the government after they had planned to be in opposition. They had to be convinced. So they got two and a half jobs. Quite good for the party that blew up the government in the first place. 

Ultimately, it was a bad move for the party and mistake that lost Alexander De Croo his seat as party leader. Opposition would have given them time to find their lost identity and become the big alternative for N-VA for those who were unhappy with the government. If, as they expected, N-VA's popularity had waned (it didn't) there would be another big opposition party ready for battle. 

If they had stayed in opposition, the internal coup wouldn't have happened. "

screenmagnet,relationships,1389565692.0,"It has nothing to do with 'giving credit'. If you accept that a particular mentally ill person commits an act of violence *because* of their illness (e.g. due to lack of impulse control, lack of insight/judgment, delusions, hallucinations, and/or mania), then that act is not in keeping with their character. That means that the act is not an accurate reflection of their behaviour when their illness is being successfully treated. I.e. they would not behave that way if they were not experiencing an episode of their illness. If that is the case, the act does not reflect their moral character, empathy, compassion, personality, or tendency for benevolence/malevolence.

Are there people who are mentally ill and also assholes? Sure. In that case, their violence is attributable to the fact that they are an asshole, and their mental illness plays little or no part as a cause of their violence. If this was the case, then OP's wife would have been abusive and violent even before she was ill. And she would be just as much of an asshole during a manic episode as she is when her mood is normal. The impression I got from the OP's post is that his wife had not always been a violent person, and that her violence occurred during a severe mood episode.

I have never been physically violent toward another person. But I don't think this is because I am better or nicer person than the OP's wife. Rather, it is because my manic episodes have been less severe, or perhaps because my mania manifests with different symptoms (some people get violent; I shop, do drugs, have lots of sex, and exhibit extremely poor judgment at work). Does this mean that my mania will never manifest with violent behaviour? I hope not, but I can't know for sure. It would be exceedingly arrogant and ignorant of me to say that I would never become violent during an uncontrolled manic episode. And even if my bipolar never makes me violent, something else could. Perhaps I will one day develop a brain tumour or dementia, or delirium, and these could cause me to become physically aggressive or violent. Everyone has the potential to become violent due to a medical illness or as a side effect of certain medications. *Everyone*.

ixAp0c,NewSkaters,1389565704.0,"Get an 8.0"" wide deck.  It's right in between the wider decks and skinnier decks (most decks range 7.5 - 8.5, some are wider than 8.5 though but they are harder to find), 7.5 - 8.0 is good for technical and street skating, and 8.0 - 8.5 is good for parks, the wider you get the more stable it is on the transition ramps like quarterpipes, bowls, etc. 

And you don't need to know a lot to make a custom complete, you just need to ask around in a place like this if you need help or do a bit of google searching for different sites with information, it's all out there.

If your going to be skating street, smooth asphalt, and concrete mostly, and street skating (skating street obstacles eventually as you progress), go with some Bones STF Wheels (Street Tech Formula), they never flat spot and last a really long time.  

Get some Bones Reds for bearings, they are fairly cheap but last awhile as long as you maintain them by cleaning them when they are dirty and applying some oil like Bones Speed Cream.

And for trucks, go with Independent, Thunder, or Venture, and get some trucks that are 8.0"" wide to start.  You'll want some Low trucks, they make flip tricks a bit more stable and make it easier to pop the board.  

Mob grip is good, it's really grippy and lasts awhile.  If you don't want something as gritty you could go with Jessup.  

Hardware doesn't really matter, but Shorty's is a very reputable hardware company so you could get their hardware if you want.  They've been around awhile and were the first to make the 1"" hardware, hence the name ""Shorty's"" for shorter bolts.

In a rural area you probably don't want to do taxi work, but if you're near a city talk to a driver there to get a feel for how much business there is. Anyway taxi is always gonna be a 1099 type job not hourly, so there's good days and slow days, I always make 100-200 here in berkeley with the odd outlier day on either end. in general, the bigger/denser the city the more reliable and lucrative the work. 

It's nice your state has no waiter wage, that's bullshit, I will say though that I hope you've got a calendar of regular service for your car and how much you need to put away each week to pay for it, also be sure and put away a good amount of money for the eventuality of random expensive repairs on your car. My experience in food delivery was that it seemed to pay great until you took your car to the shop. The big advantage of taxi is not being responsible for maintenance so you know you can keep/use every done you make.

Anyway it's also just more fun in my opinion, when it's slow you get some reading done or chill at home, when it's fast you're making bank. You meet hella different people from all walks of life, like you'll drop off the black tie director of an ninterational non profit only to pick up a small time drug dealer a minute later. It's way less lonely or monotonous than just you and the food and the same conversation at 1000 different doorsteps. Plus you hardly ever have to deal with your boss and customers are generally much less entitled than in the food industry. It's kind of hilarious how just being a minimally inoffensive/genuine person will have customers falling all over themselves with thanks and huge tips and requesting you etc... A lot of taxi drivers are super mean so the bar is low I guess. Plus you can just not talk to customers if they're dicks or you don't feel like it, and they're aware you can make em walk so customers typically are careful not to be dicks.

Anyway, look into it and call around, the two basic models are you rent the cab at a flat weekly rate and keep whatever profit you drum up, or the less lucrative/less risky model where you just split the meter with your boss (which is my situation) there will be some startup costs associated with putting down a refundable deposit with the company you work for and getting licensed in your city, but after that it's all gravy.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389565751.0,"It's complicated.  As a kid, I was mostly ignored by my mom.  She wasn't absent, it's just she spent a lot of time with my older sister, helping her with homework or other stuff.  One thing I find kind of telling; there's this ""Girl Talk"" book about puberty and such, which she gave my sister during middle school.  Neither my mom nor my sister passed this on to me when I got to middle school, I just figured out the whole period thing on my own.  Years later, during a random conversation with my mom, I realized she thought she did give it to me and thought she did do a lot of things with me.  But really she was thinking of my older sister.  Most of our interaction was more of having me do chores, scolding me about my grades (""You got 100 but it shoud've been 110.  How could you get this bonus question wrong, it's so easy! This is your problem, you don't read directions properly."")

I never really had a rebellious stage in my life.  While I did go clubbing a lot in high school, my mom strangely didn't mind it.  She used to go clubbing when she was younger.  She'd even encourage these short outfits that, looking back, I would probably think were pretty slutty.  She'd tell me to put my hair up all the time, because guys love to see the nape of your neck.  But I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend, and no guys interested me at the time, so this was a non-issue.

We do fight.  We used to fight badly.  She still picks fights with me sometimes, often blaming me for things that were her fault, or blaming me for things my sister did and thinking it was me.  I am sometimes a surrogate doll for her to rant at.  This used to bother me a lot, and I used to yell back....but realized this was not HELPFUL to anyone.  Yelling back just causes her to get more mad and then yell at me, rather righteously, that I shouldn't speak to my elders with such an attitude.  I learned you have to just let this shit go.  Don't add fuel to someone else's fire.  No matter how much I argue, especially if I show emotion, it's not going to change her opinion.  So why make the both of us aggravated with nothing to gain?

Since I realized that, and started acting on it....things have been way better.  We're happier.  I realized how I can redirect my mom's anger when she starts picking on me, and it all requires me to keep up a cool and calm demeanor.  We talk on the phone for hours sometimes, sharing stories about the people we know and the friends we have."

He also gets downvoted a lot here because people started noticing his name after the entire incident with the comic.

Don't get me wrong, **many of the things he says are very hostile**, but to just assume he is going to be hostile, and then treat him as such, is going to end up with you confirming your own bias. It's the exact same thing he has done - assume short people are going to be vitriolic and hostile, and then pre-emptively act vitriolic and hostile towards them.

[But if you treat him like a person, and politely call him out on some of the stuff he says, he acts like a person.](http://www.reddit.com/r/short/comments/1urcj2/short_men_are_inherently_inferior/cekzv7s)

This is a very popular recipe and is designed to mimic a smoked brisket if you don't have a smoker.  The brisket is elevated above the liquid so it takes on the BBQ taste without getting mushy.


Slow Cooker BBQ Brisket

* Large (3-4 cups) fat separator

* Baking dish

* 1 flat cut brisket (can sub point cut, but harder to find and more fatty)

* 1 aluminum loaf pan

* Â½ cup water


Rub:

* Â½ cup packed dark brown sugar

* Â½ tbs paprika

* 1 tbs ground cumin

* 1 tsp salt

* 2 tsp black pepper

* 2 tbs canned chipotle peppers in adobo, minced


BBQ Sauce base:

* 1 onion

* 3 tbs veg. oil

* 2 tbs tomato paste

* 1 tbs chili powder

* 1 tbs chipotle chili in adobe, minced

* 2 garlic cloves mince


BBQ Sauce for serving:

* Â¼ cup ketchup

* 1 tbs cider vinegar

* Â¼ tsp liquid smoke


Score the fat side of the brisket, in a cross hatch, through to the meat about Â½ inch apart.

Mix the rub with your hands and press into both sides of the brisket, working into cuts.

Meanwhile Make BBQ base: In skillet, over medium high, heat veg oil and saute onions 5 minutes.  Add tomato paste, and stir 1 minute until it browns.  Add remaining ingredients, stir and cook 30 seconds.  Pour into slow cooker in the middle, cover completely with loaf pan.  Put brisket on top of aluminum pan.

Pour water down side (not over brisket), cover, cook 7-8 hours on high, 10-12 on low.

Transfer brisket, with two tongs, to a baking dish, cover with foil and rest 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, remove loaf pan and pour juices into fat separator (should have 2 cups), let sit 5 minutes.

Transfer brisket to cutting board, slice on an angle against the grain, return to baking dish.

Pour 1 cup of defatted juices over brisket.  pour the other cup into large bowl and add the ketchup, vinegar, liquid smoke.  Whisk together.

Serve / plate the brisket and spoon final sauce over. 

Accompany with creamy slaw.

 To do some comparisons, the best graphics card right now is the 780 ti, which costs $700 (source: http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/high_end_gpus.html). You could get two of them and combine their power, maybe even enough power to get max settings on the game, as the best rig that anyone at CIG has is two Titans (comes in third place in graphics cards).

However, a reminder text should do two things: (a) tell you how to properly play the mechanic in the vast majority of cases, and (b) alert you when there's a more complicated case, so that you know you have to research the answer.

Let's see how that works with miracle. The reminder text for miracle tells you how to play it in most cases, of course. But consider a special case: drawing multiple cards while one of them has miracle. If you try to apply the reminder text of miracle to this situation, it's really unclear what to do. Ah! This must mean you have to check the answer on the internet.

Now consider bestow. Suppose the target for the Aura is now illegal. Normally, this would mean the Aura gets countered. Does the reminder text for bestow suggest anything differently? Not really. It clearly says the Aura only turns into a creature if it's on the battlefield, so if we interpret the reminder text literally, the Aura very clearly has to get countered!

dbaker102194,AskMen,1389566489.0,"20, Kansas, White, Hate my mom, love/hate my dad.

Currently in Uni, so it's hard to say that I'm totally on my own. But more than 3/4 of the year I don't live with them. So, there's that. 

My mom is just obnoxious, lacks all tact, shoves religion on people, prays loudly at inopportune times (like in public), doesn't give a damn about my happiness and just wants me to fit the image of her son, she kicked me out once when she found out my girlfriend and I were sexually active (I was 16 at the time) I spent 4 days living with different friends until *dad* said I could come home. So basically, fuck her.

Dad's a lot better, like a lot better. He keeps to himself mostly, which is fine. He is a strong believer in corporal punishment (for boys only) so I got hit a lot growing up. Which is fine, I guess, I think it probably helped in some respects, but it sure wasn't fun. He definitely toughened me up a lot, although probably to the point that Child Protective Services might have taken me away if they had known. I broke my thumb in an accident one day, and he told be to quit being a baby and deal with it. Today I literally cannot move that thumb (my right thumb, which is my dominant one) and I have no feeling in it either. Same thing went for a minor break in a leg once. That healed well on it's own though.  

He would also force me to go camping a lot, he's something of a survivalist. It got a little out of hand when he would pack me in the car, drive 50 miles or so away and tell me to get home (We lived in the country, so there would be literally nothing for 50 miles). I don't know how I feel about that. At the time it was kinda fun. I sorta enjoyed it. Looking back I realize it was kinda fucked up to abandon a 12 year old and tell him to figure shit out for himself. Anyway, my uncle, my dads brother, died when I was 15, and dad started drinking a lot. He got abusive verbally towards the whole family, and physically towards me. We got into fist fights, and one time I broke his neck. He survived, but it didn't heal properly on it's own, so he ended up having to get some major spinal reconstruction surgery. The drinking and abuse stopped after that.

My sister was the favorite child, I had to clean up after her when she made a mess, she could do basically whatever the fuck she wanted (this includes underage drunk driving) and my parent's didn't give a shit. So I'm more than a little peeved about the unequal treatment. But whatever, my sister is crashing and burning right now, so I'm glad they didn't treat me the same way they did her.

Mom hasn't changed, still can't stand her. Dad has stopped treating me like a kid he's trying to raise, and now treats me as an adult, which means higher expectations, but less ""parenting."" So it's a trade off. All and all I feel like a sufficiently well adjusted member of society."

My hair is pretty rad, I know what I'm doing with makeup, I dress well, my eyes and lips and general face structure are nice. 

I don't like assigning numbers to myself or others. I'd say I'm moderately attractive. I gauge this by several things. (1) My perception of myself, (2) General reactions of others on my appearance, (3) The attractiveness level of those complimenting me on my appearance. For some reason, when someone who I find attractive tells me they think I am attractive, it won't necessarily mean more to me, but it makes me feel I am at least on par with that person.

On the whole, I don't really give a shit. I'm happy with how I look. I'm not a goddess, but I don't think I'm ugly, and I think I am even more than just plain average. I could be wrong, but that's just how I perceive myself and I'm okay with it. I'd rather think too highly of my appearance than think poorly of it."

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1389566588.0,"Yes!  I already love RTS, grew up on Warcraft and Starcraft and games like Fire Emblem.  I would love to date someone who is also in to that stuff, but this comes with a HUGE precaution.....and it's the same precaution I would have if I didn't know a thing about RTS games.  He MUST be patient and/or a willing teacher.  He MUST understand that RTS comes with a big learning curve, that you are never instantly good at any RTS, and that you can't tell your girlfriend she sucks at gaming and that you ""don't understand why can't do this simple build order"" when it's like her first day trying it out.  A lot of RTS players have YEARS of experience, it isn't fair to compare that to someone who may not have played games ever, let alone an RTS...which other long time gamers find very difficult too.  My ex-boyfriend was in to SC and I thought that would be great.  Well I have a job and haven't had time to keep my skills fresh since years ago, so I'd be like gold league compared to his diamond.  And he'd yell at me and get so frustrated at me for being ""bad"".  Don't be that guy.  That is how you turn your girlfriend off from gaming!

As long as you're patient and encouraging, I know this can be a hobby you can get your SO to appreciate and enjoy along with you.

My current boyfriend doesn't play RTS games.  His roommates would play SC but he'd forego that; too complicated, he'd say.  It's definitely a stressful game.  So I bought Fire Emblem: Awakening for the 3DS very excitedly last year, and gushed about it to him.  He never played this genre, but I insisted he would love how it makes you ""think""; and what's great is that it's turn based...so it's less pressure than an RTS while still being a strategy game.  I shared some tips with him.  I gave him pointers.  And guess what...he ended up loving the game!!!  He'll never play an RTS, but turn based seems like a good fit for him now."

Also, its origin stretches back further than what you write, with its origin in 1219 when the Teutonic Order stated using it. As a medal its use began in 1813 during the Napoleonic wars, in the Prussian Kingdom. It is also the current symbol for the German Bundeswehr, and has been since 1956.

* 1) place a stick in the ground , marking its shadow and take a seat.

* 2) wait 15 minutes. For a rough idea of 15 minutes, strike up a fire and make a brew.

Then mark a line that bufurcates these. This gives a, north south line. If the sun I's on the west side it's evening and if it's on the east it's morning.

It could be a good time for people to politely suggest to others little changes that could improve their appearance. Like, 'you should try doing your makeup this way', 'you'd look great with bangs'. It would just be hard to find that middle ground of not being so honest to the point where it's hurtful (""Sorry, but you're like a 2/10. You're fat and have a big nose"", etc.) and being overly cushioning to the point where it might not help the person at all (""you're perfect now, you're gorgeous, don't change a thing"", when the person has clear changes that would help them).

It's a really tricky area. We should promote being happy with ourselves and being who we are, but there's also nothing wrong with altering your appearance to see if it would help that person's perception of themselves."

It's a game that has you placing market stalls in rows on a ""block"" in the world famous Portobello Market neighbourhood of London, but you can only place them where the Bobby (the cop) stands. Players can opt to move the Bobby, but there are limitations and potential hazards with that strategy.

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1389566961.0,"And don't forget ""Timeless,"" where at the end of the episode, Guilt-Ridden Future Harry's message to Present Harry still exists even though Guilt-Ridden Future Harry never will. This happens pretty consistently in Voyager, so in that sense, at least, ""Endgame"" fit in with the rest of the series' take on time travel, even if that take doesn't make a lot of sense.

The easy malleability of the timeline at least explains why the Temporal Prime Directive is necessary. Since the timeline isn't remotely deterministic, the Federation is obviously going to be worried about people making changes to it.

It also creates a total mess of a situation. How many people have single-handedly changed the timeline to suit their preferences, as Harry and Chakotay did in ""Timeless""? How many people that the Federation doesn't have the slightest inkling about? These are changes that could affect billions and trillions of lives.

It *potentially* becomes a little more comforting if you imagine that that's why Starfleet eventually built their timeships and started policing the timeline to prevent that kind of meddling. That'd be splendid. But no 29th century timeships show up to stop Harry and Chakotay from fucking around with the timeline, or to stop Admiral Janeway from doing so. So either they don't or *can't* detect and prevent every instance of temporal tampering.

Which just brings the question back around to... how many other people have been fucking with the timeline without the Federation's knowledge, and what if they've made some very detrimental changes that we have no way of knowing about?"

flashmedallion,metalgearsolid,1389567054.0,"It's your muscle memory that really carries you throughout the game.  Once you've trained your hands to respond to your thoughts, the complexity of the controls suddenly becomes a beautiful method of expression.  Of course, by the time you get this down in the game, Vamp shows up to ruin your day specifically by exploiting your muscle memory.

Anyway, I suggest using the VR Training to... well, train.  Play through some of the weapon modes, then a few Eliminate All scenarios.  They are there to help you get better, and the difficulty curve is just right.

**Quick Tips/""Combos"":**  (this from PS, I don't know the Xbox buttons)

Tap the ""equip"" bumper to bring up your pistol, then press and hold , rapidly and in order: 

    [Raise Weapon] -&gt; [First Person] (top left bumper?) -&gt; [Lock-on] (top right bumper?)

Practice this over and over again.

Then practice quickly disengaging by releasing [First Person], running forward (with [Lock-on] held down),
then unequipping your weapon and finally releasing the [Raise Weapon] button.

Get both of these routines down perfectly and it I think it will help familiarise your brain with how the controller setup works."

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,turning,1389567079.0,"This may not help with your furnace, but I've found being vigilant with cleaning really helps. This is sort of an obvious statement, yet so many pics and videos from this sub and /r/woodworking show the dirtiest shops I have ever seen. 

I keep a tub underneath the lathe with a lid. I take off the lid when I start and I've found most of the dust and shavings go right down into it. I also place the lathe somewhat near a wall so that the wall catches most of the flyaways. Periodically I take a break and use a large soft brush to brush the dust and shavings off the lathe and down through the gap in the bed into the tub. When I am done for the day I always brush down the wall and the sweep up the dust and shavings and toss them into the bin. Again, most of the debris has already been caught up in the tub so this takes 3 minutes tops. Then I close the lid.

Just force yourself to never leave the area without sweeping it down first. My first turning teach was super anal about cleanliness and I've found it's really easy to maintain. I don't know how much this will cut down on superfine dust and machinery, but I will tell you I had my lathe set up in a garage with tons of other random items stored nearby and they didn't seem to get much dirtier than normal.  I've also done this when I shared a rented small space with another woodworker who only had hand tools and they never once complained about excess dust from my turning. And because I always sweep up I'm not walking around and kicking up dust from days before nor breathing that crap in.

Tommy's obviously a little miffed because we like this toy, we think it's cool and fun and interesting. We're not fucking idiots, we KNOW it's all just pretend, we just don't care and think the game is fun anyways. Refusing to play with the toy doesn't make you more grown-up than the rest of us.

Fahris,tall,1389567161.0,"Mmmmm, I think it has a lot to do with being active and learning to be comfortable with your body, particularly growing up. One of my BFFs is 5'2"", and she's a complete spaz all the time, and struggles with things like getting on and off escalators. As a kid, she was never allowed to have recess (she had asthma, and her mom is incredibly controlling). So, she never really learned how to be coordinated and graceful.

I think the same kind of thing happens to a lot of tall people. For example, I ""played"" basketball, but I was always so lanky and all-elbows that I was awful, and I ended up rarely playing because I'd end up fouling people, or just being a spaz with the ball. So, I lost interest and didn't want to continue, and as a result didn't improve and I'm still a total spaz when it comes to basketball.

Lots of tall people experience things like this, and I feel that absolute height matters less compared to how comfortable they feel in their surroundings. Gender matters because experiences between genders are different - you mentioned that you make fun of your 5'9"" male friends, but in female spaces, 5'9"" is pretty tall.

OP might not be as much of a spaz as the guy in the gif, but what matters is that she identified with the flailing."

&gt; It's commonly agreed upon (but not exactly established ""canon"") that the Khajiit who are outside of Elsweyr (where you play) are outside of Elsweyr for a good reason. There aren't many Khajiit outside of Elsweyr because they'd like to see more of the world or expand riches in some other land to travel, but they do exist. Most aren't decent folk; Ri'saad in Skyrim, when asked about his homeland, eventually stops and says ""Ri'saad will talk no more, for he misses his home"" or something along those lines. Just using him as an example, there's a few reasons as to why he isn't there, either A: He's no longer welcome after whatever criminal activity he may have participated in or B: he is VERY faithful and is following the moonpath that leads him throughout Skyrim. That last one may be a possibility for Ri'Saad and other caravaners, but it doesn't really work for many other outside Khajiit. I wouldn't be surprised if many who work for those lead caravaners work took it on because they couldn't find another type of work/lifestyle they're accustomed to in Elsweyr that wasn't thievery (in the well known sense).

So no, the Khajiit have not changed. It's just that the Khajiit outside of Elsweyr are smugglers and thieves. "

I mean if you look at the Patriot weapons when he was still with us, you had Gronk, Hernandez, Brady, Welker, Ridley/Vereen and then you kinda make your way down to Woodhead who would rip off 10 yard gains when he was put in.  When the Patriots moved to downsize the RB corps this year, they believed that Vereen was of equal or better talent as Woodhead who was supposedly going to begin losing ground by getting too much attention and Vereen was cheaper.  They saved something like 2 million by letting woodhead go which is a decent chunk of change to apply to another contract to try and keep other critical components, entice new talent, etc.

But now Woodhead is sitting in the Chargers backfield and has had an amazing season which only reinforces what I always thought - he's not a novelty, he's just that damn good."

Just to give you an idea of that power, again, this is better than anyone at CIG's computer. At 1080p and 1440p it will destroy games (probably not Star Citizen at 1440p). Basically, it will be all you will need for quite awhile. Now if you like it, go to /r/buildapc or /r/buildapcforme or /r/pcmasterrace (although if you go there they won't be as appreciateive, but sometimes /r/buildapc and /r/buildapcforme just don't respond) and have them check it to see if they agree with it. It will be red and black, and the second case I showed you had a window on the side."

In reality, it will cause rates to go UP, because human-driven cars will suddenly be classified as ""high risk,"" which will allow insurance companies to charge an arm and a leg to anyone who still drives.

hermithome,AskHistorians,1389567686.0,"No, you misunderstand me, I don't think the camps were black and white, not at all. I think that the various motivating forces for the kind of stuff you discuss does not apply in this situation or worse, is undermined.

There was all sorts of stuff they didn't want the Sonderkommando's doing. They didn't want them getting their hands on valuables yes, but all sorts of other stuff. The longer they were there, the more comfortable they got with the camp and were better able to work stuff out. They could have passed food and information to people in another part of the camp. They could have organised a break. They could have done all sorts of stuff. Keeping them alive gave them opportunities to see how all the wheels and cogs move and that's not what you want.

And going back to your point about Kapos...I understand the motivating factors clearly. But the positions are very different. Kapos had some sense of power and agency. Some used that to try and help their fellow prisoners, some used that to hurt their fellow prisoners and elevate themselves. Those motivations work differently though when you have no one below you. Someone who gets a twisted pleasure in guarding and abusing their own people does not equal someone who gets pleasure out of lugging around corpses. It's just not transferable.

There's also the fact that all of this isn't black and white. People react unpredictably to horrible circumstances. Trying to suss out who would react in what way is an investment in time, and a gamble. It also requires the guards to look at the prisoners as human and try and guess their motivations, something that they didn't want to do and that the Nazi part would have discouraged.

Choosing people to manipulate and use in this manner requires recognising them as people, with feelings and motivations and such. That doesn't go so well with dehumanisation and that's why this would not have been policy.

And here's the bottom line....killing Sonderkommandos was easy. They need little training, and fuck, their all going to be killed anyway. Killing them regularly is not a hassle. Your method requires a greater input of time, thought, energy and I believe nets you an outcome with higher risk. I'll believe that you've studied the Holocaust but you either see some great benefit in keeping the same people (I don't see one at all really), or you don't understand the greatly increased difficult and complexity.


Again, I'm not disagreeing with any of the things you cite, I'm aware of all that stuff. I know a lot about the Holocaust. I'm disagreeing with the your understanding of the human motivations behind the stories. You know the stories of how people acted but you don't quite seem to get the why or that this is not at all predictable."

Triplanetary,DaystromInstitute,1389567688.0,"&gt;Voyager seemed to be more like a border patrol cutter or coast guard ship assigned to law enforcement that ended up in the deep stuff. 

Disagree. Voyager was clearly stated to be a science/exploration ship. It was only assigned to track down Chakotay's ship because certain of its technologies (such as the bioneural circuitry) made it the best-suited ship for navigating the Badlands. This was absolutely not intended to be a regular occurrence for Voyager.

And Janeway comes from a science background, not an engineering background, which is why she was selected as captain of a science ship. Her first posting was as science officer on the *Al-Batani*.

So it stands to reason that an exploration vessel would be moderately armed, since threats do pop up in deep space. But I absolutely don't think we can extrapolate from one fluke of a mission that Voyager was intended as a police cruiser."

speccynerd,China,1389567825.0,"For a spouse visa, rather than a tourist visa, you would have to show (this from [UK Border Agency](http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/visas-immigration/partners-families/citizens-settled/spouse-cp/can-you-apply/)):


*     you and your partner are both aged 18 or over at the date of application;
*     your partner is a British Citizen, or is present and settled in the UK, or is here with refugee leave or humanitarian protection;
*     your partner is not related to you in a way that means you could not marry in UK law;
*     you and your partner have met in person;
*     your relationship with your partner is genuine and subsisting;
*     if you are married or in a civil partnership, your marriage or civil partnership is valid in UK law;
*     if you are not married or in a civil partnership you have been living with your partner in a relationship akin to marriage or civil partnership for at least 2 years prior to the date of the application;
*     you meet the suitability requirements;
*     any previous relationship has permanently broken down (this does not apply to certain polygamous relationships);
*     you and your partner intend to live together permanently in the UK;
*     you meet the financial requirement;
*     you meet the English language requirement; and
*     you meet the immigration requirement;


Financial requirement is that you earn over 18k a year, and have done so for the past year. English test should be easy enough if her English is good."

Monosentence,GameDeals,1389567887.0,"Thats such a shame. The ending and post-ending movie/secret ending past the credits is so good. Its a pleasant end to the game.

To 9, that is. And yes, the hype and generational issues really put a damper on it. FF9 rests as one of my favorite rpg's, and could easily have been amped up a little more and made a ps2 game. The graphics were super good for the time, and still reasonably good looking even now. 

Plus, every character had ambitions. Deadset ambitions, worries, insecurities, and emotion. The two previous to it had glimpses of this, but not as firmly as 9 did.

It was nice seeing the characters evolve and shed their problems as they grew stronger. The ending solidified their bond, too. I suggest you watch it on youtube if you have no plan to beat it yourself. =)"
