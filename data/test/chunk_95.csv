GeoffreyArnold,short,1391086348.0,"For the curious, the study says that a 5'2"" man would need to make $331,500 a year to be as successful in dating as a 5'11"" man who makes $62,500 a year.  Plus, there is an additional (and surprisingly, even more severe) penalty for being Asian.  

Of course, this only applies to online dating because that's the only way the researchers could get reliable evidence based on behavior (you couldn't just ask someone this question straight out and expect an honest response).  

So, if you're a 5'3"" Asian, I'm guessing somewhere north of $500,000 a year.  But that's a crude guess.  And even then, it wouldn't guarantee that you could find a date.  You'd still have to do the leg work and broadcast the fact that you have money (nice watch, nice car, nice clothes, etc.).  That half-a-million only gets you to ""average height white guy"" territory.  It doesn't make you an Adonis or anything.  "

Over Christmas I got a Wheely driver who couldn't believe his luck, because he'd decided to pick up one more fare before going home and I lived a couple of streets over from him. Apparently the app their drivers use doesn't actually show where the fare is going, so they have to decide that they're either picking a fare up or going home. It means the drivers don't stay online picking and choosing fares and making it seem like they have more capacity than they do."

speedisavirus,politics,1391086381.0,"I survived on $12k-$16k a year so I'm not off the mark. This wasn't that long ago so we are effectively talking today's money. That would be a nominal range, if working 40 hours a week, which I was not, between $5.75 and $7.69. Living alone is a luxury. Going out is a luxury. Having a smart phone is a luxury. In some cases a car is a luxury. That knocks out most of the high expenses in a person's life outside of healthcare which I think should be universal like much of the developed world. 

Jobs are abundant for me. I get asked to interview once every week or two but this isn't about me because I chose a high demand degree. This is about other people that either have no degree, an unemployable degree, or no trade skill. I know plenty of people that did major in what I would consider unemployable skills such as ceramics and poetry but also others that don't have a degree or didn't get a traditional diploma. Some are unemployed. Some are not. It's not because they can't find a job. Its just they can't find a job that they want to do. I would wager this is the case with many people. 

There are plenty of clerical, food, and service industry jobs available. Sales. Basically anything with a high turn over rate is a potential job for someone that REALLY wants a job. The turnover usually is because someone is quitting. Some of them even pay decent. Home Depot started me at over $10 an hour and seem to fall in the $9.50 and up starting point for non cashiers. Working warehouse at Walmart, Lowes, and Sams Club pays about the same. Being a food server or bartender can pay significantly more than minimum wage though there are lean times so saving money is important. There is always telemarketing which has huge turnover. 

Even the people I know with multiple arrests and felony convictions can find jobs so please don't tell me someone that isn't a black convict with maybe a GED can't find any work. They just can't find work they want or that pays what they want so they prefer to stay without a job. They don't want to be a janitor, a desk clerk, a cashier, clean dishes, serve tables, work in sales, landscape, frame houses, pave roads, wash cars, work a farm, clean chickens, etc. 

I'm perfectly in touch. I'm the only person in my entire family, other than now my sister, to get a high school diploma or even go to college (well my mom did get a HS diploma but we graduated high school the same year). Outside of my coworkers, most of the people I socialize with did not choose an employable degree in college or didn't go.

If you get that feeling you feel horrible; someone literally only cares about the fact that you are a woman, that is enough for him to want to sleep with you (and nothing else, because he doesn't know anything else), you enforced this idea when you said she was pretty (not 'I want to get to know you', or 'how are you doing', etc). If I run into a guy who's just looking for ANY woman, I lose a lot of respect for him. I think this is what happened.

adanielpsych,changemyview,1391086509.0,"&gt;I understand people need to learn about the importance of equality

Good. What is life without historical context?

&gt;but I do not believe forcing children to read

Our educational system is based on forcing children to do things they may not like at that time. If you give a 10 year old the option of eating candies and chocolate instead of going to school, what do you think she'll pick? This whole ""forcing is bad"" thing is illogical. 

&gt;forcing children to read books will not make them smarter, diverse, or even happy

It certainly won't make them smarter. One's intelligence quotient is locked at birth. The bottom line is that children, of course, hate going to school at a certain age. This doesn't mean that we should give in to their wants. As adults, we often know what is best for children. Also, reading books actually *does* make you a more cultured individual. If we didn't make them read books, what else would we do? They probably hate lectures, too. 

Learning about diversity is extremely important. We are approaching an era of ultimate diversity. No longer will individuals seek ""pride"" in their skin color. Shouldn't we prepare kids for this?"

plusoneeffpee,jobs,1391086632.0,"&gt;You're still relying on resumes and cover letters to filter your applicant pool. 

What would you suggest they use instead?

&gt;This also came from some type of ATS, where they don't really encourage any in-depth essays, especially if they just have a giant field at the end of the application that says ""Other Information"".

His point is not just the crappy cover letter, it's the fact that the applicant doesn't even know what the job title is. From the hiring managers I've met, this is not necessarily an ""honest mistake""; this happens frequently. Jobs are posted with specific qualifications (e.g., must have experience with X), and people with no experience, training, or even knowledge of X apply.

But the big point to us, as applicants, here is that, as job seekers, this kind of application should piss us off, too. This applicant is a person that didn't even get the *job title right* in the application. They didn't mention any of the specific skills clearly listed in the job posting. They obviously aren't paying attention. This is a shotgun application, the same damn thing copy pasted and sent to 100 hiring managers in a day.

**This is the noise that is interfering with our signal**. This is an example of the reason hiring managers resort to ATS's. 

I don't feel sorry for OP that much, either, because the pile of crap we have to deal with on the applicant side is (IMHO) significantly larger and shittier than the hiring side has to deal with. This cover letter is indeed part of his pile of crap.....but it's part of ours, too.

veryloudnoises,canucks,1391086987.0,"agreed - i definitely don't mind losing to this year's hawks. 

am i being overly optimistic when i say that as crappy as we're playing, we're still in a spot for the playoffs? i feel like we're missing a catalyst, which is a role sami and ehrhoff played to a tee. just like coffey was a catalyst to gretzky. 

the years daniel and henrik won the scoring titles, our PP was huge, quarterbacked by ehrhoff. i'm not sure of the numbers, but would i be too far off the mark to say that at least 30% of our top scorers' goals were struck on the PP from '09-'12? 

maybe a total retooling isn't what's needed - ehrhoff played to the sedins' strengths by taking the puck in with speed, creating space as the defense scrambled to catch him, then let the sedins work the perimeter with burr/kes sitting on the doorstep. i feel like we just don't have that catalyst in our lineup.

edler seems to be the most movable piece here - if we were to trade him for someone ehrhoff-like (i don't even know who that would be, TBH, and keep in mind i'm the first to admit i'd be an awful GM), be it another D man or a skilled forward, would we regain what we lost? in the case of resparking the sedins/kes, i feel like we'd need another stud D man. 

and am i being a total fool for pointing out that ovi had some shit years and is now back to form? we don't necessarily need the sedins to be 100+ point producers (though it couldn't hurt our regular season stats) as much as we need the depth or that catalyst d-man.

pharao007,unitedkingdom,1391087127.0,"&gt;It's perfectly possible to live life without a car.

So basically your argument goes along the lines that a sport should be equal with all other aspects of life. Even if that sport uses lethal and deadliest weapon the law should be constructed in a way it allows people to keep sport tools like guns just because they want to.

You really are pushing your arguments into a pointless void. I don't mind guns used for sports. I mind keeping those guns at homes as they bring extra threat, which you don't see with most other things in sport or daily life. You just can't compare cars and guns together as it doesn't make any sense. As a matter of fact, I can even defend that argument and tell you that some cars are not allowed for public roads and used only for sports - showing correlation with guns used only for sport and guns which don't have to be kept at home.

And yes, I'm lumping all guns together as their main reason of existence is killing people, whether at war or on streets. Reducing number of weapons subsequently reduced risk of their possible inadequate use. In any case, most people don't need a gun kept at home. They do need cars kept at home, not in a museum or on racing track only."

edit: clarification: The list here isn't my full to-buy list. I've got other cross-platform games on that one, and some that aren't necessarily ""great games"" like Tony Hawk Underground, Need for Speed Underground 2, Spider-Man 2. Maybe they are great. Who knows!"
SerPuissance,pics,1391087360.0,"Well I've actually talked to a few planning officers about it, and essentially they say that as long as the contruction is up to code and the design is a good ""fit"" for the local area they don't mind what it's actually made out of. My plan was to have containers as the underlying structure and then clad the outside in whatever local houses are like, but perhaps a little more modern. Recycled and repurposed materials add value to your application too.

Thing is everyon sees planning as the enemy and tries to sneak around it, if you actually engage with them and explain yourself in a nice way they're often quite accomodating :)."

In other words, do you follow Peter Singer's utilitarian lead and donate everything you make beyond what you need for simple subsistence, in order to ameliorate the suffering you cause? If you do, kudos - you're a better person than me. But if you don't, how do you justify it?

In essence, I have nothing against Vegans - it is a personal choice. My problem is with the campaign promoted by some Vegans trying to impose a very arbitrary set of values on everybody else.

I know when I was a kid I was super tomboyish. I would say I wanted to be a boy, I hated all girl stuff, etc. But I am not transgendered and I like being female.

You are overreacting. This is an invalid assumption you make with no evidence to back it up.

Because no matter who you are with, your insecurities will always be there unless you deal with them.

In Michigan the patron cannot touch the stripper and if the stripper requests the patron sit on their hands for a lap dance, the patron must comply.

The doc cut mine so they had about an inch hanging down before they nestled up against the cervix, but now I have to search for them by tracing a ring around the cervix with my finger. One turn around is all it takes to locate and I do that once or twice per month, it's quick and easy to do while in the shower and that way it doesn't interrupt the vibe when sex comes up.

I was kind on the opposite side of things from you, the thought of the implant creeped me out because I've read about them migrating and doctors having trouble finding them to remove them. The IUD wasn't scary to me because having the strings sticking out seemed like it would be reassuring that everything was in place where it belonged. Even so, the implant was what my doctor recommended since the school clinic could do them. I had to go to the hospital to get my IUD.

He could just not see *animals* as having any real value, or that their suffering means nothing. It doesn't mean he's a sociopath/psychopath, it just means he was raised differently. Treatment and value of animals is, to a large extent, a societal norm and not an innate part of humanity. Were he, for instance, raised in the south, it could be very likely that he was raised in a fundamentalist christian home wherein he was taught that animals are purely to be ruled over by humans, and they may do to animals what they want. He may have also had a lot of value placed on being a soldier and fighting for one's country. This would also open him up to the propaganda experienced within any military to dehumanize the enemy. This makes it easier to kill people. Especially if he's been over there for a while, people take pride in their kills (it is a great coping mechanism when one is forced to kill people day in and day out). If he's already killed in war, he may now also have a sort of ""interest"" in it, for lack of a better term. Many people, after being at war, when they return, their lives feel empty. Their normal day-to-day is, essentially, too boring for them, so they begin behaving out of character in often bizarre or violent ways.

TheFlamingOne,hearthstone,1391088538.0,"Obviously it has the flexibility, however, having one extra lore will not help save you from aggro. By running more early card draw like loot hoarder, novice, thalnos and/or nat pagle (hell, even wrath) you can draw into swipe/starfall more easily, which is really good vs aggro/midrange decks. Vs control it allows you to set up a board advantage along with hand advantage depending on matchup. 

If I choose to wait till 7 for my main card draw (granted it comes with a 5/5 body but still) I lose out on a lot of presence early on which could have been useful once I can actually start dropping big stuff. I've been running 1 lore and 1 earthen and seeing great success. It's just that every other deck seems to be running 2 lores and I don't see why."

JaminSousaphone,britishproblems,1391088676.0,"I can't help but question your point. Media City is now the home of the BBC's media operations, they obviously still have their HQ in London and what not, but this doesn't mean that news is covered more proportionately to the area they're filming in. Pretty much every guest they have on is speaking via camera-link from the HQ in London because everything STILL goes on in London. Not that there's anything wrong or surprising about that. 
Media City has done great things for Salford and the area surrounding the Lowry as it has become a beautiful place with culture and industry (media and journalism etc.) But that being said the stories covered are still the same as they were when they were in London. The only difference I would say is that BBC Breakfasts guests tend to be more Midlands-Northerners as it's obviously more viable to get those guests.


BUT then comes the question of why won't someone from London come on the show? Can't they get the train up to Manchester which takes an hour and a half and then taxi to Salford? Like when they moved everyone was up in arms. Most Londoners were painted as people who hated the North or the country outside the London borough and refused to leave the comfort of the City. I can't imagine that is the actual case and most were concerned for personal reasons, but for those outside of London, I can really understand why they think they're being fobbed off by the national media and the likes."

But even if you don't, *anyone* can open an IRA, so there's really no excuse, right? Or am I missing something? Even if you do have a 401(k), you should open up an IRA anyway. You work a job for seven years, quit and find a new job. What do you do with your money in your 401(k) from you old job? Some companies let you keep it there if it's over a certain amount, some say you have to take it out. The easy solution is to move it into your IRA and start a 401(k) with your new job.

And again, if you don't have 401(k) access, open an IRA and put your after tax dollars in there. If you start at 25, put $2,000 in an IRA every year and average 10% interest from 25 to 65, you'll retire a millionaire.

I thought id start by saying that i lurk around these parts of reddit frequently, and know that for every m50 recommendation, there is someone who is upgrading from them.  i thought id join the party.  ive had the m50s for around a year now, and i think i might want to upgrade them.  i was looking at the akg q701 as a possible candidate, as i can get them for around $300 in australia.  i was also looking at the sennheiser hd 600/50.  however, i dont want to just drop $300 for the hell of it, I want to actually upgrade. i want to know if the akg's are truly an upgrade, and if they arent, what is?

Also, please excuse my poor grammar, i dont start uni for another month, and im still in holiday mode.

thanks

**Budget** - $3 - 400, but can increase if it is required

**Source** - [topping tp30 usb dac/amp](http://www.parts-express.com/pedocs/manuals/310-312-topping-tp30-manual-8115.pdf) (not my greatest purchase, im considering the t1 as a future upgrade form massdrop maybe the next time is appears), playing mostly FLAC files from my laptop

**Requirements for Isolation** - none, I will use these at home and i feel like open headphones will give me a much greater upgrade from my m50s.

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - full sized, open, but also more comfortable than the good 'ol m50s for long listening/gaming sessions.

**Preferred tonal balance** - in all honesty im probably a basshead as i really do like the way the m50s sound.  however, that does not mean I necessarily want bassy headphones, im looking for something different.  Im open to all sounding headphones, but i think a more balanced headphone would suit me pretty well.

**Past headphones** - as mentioned above, i currently use the ath m50s.  i do really love the sound of these and they were a huge improvement over whatever rubbish i previously had.  all that said though, they can get really uncomfortable after what doesnt fell like too long, so this is something im looking to address.

**Preferred Music** - my music tastes are pretty varied, but kinda stick to the same styles.  i mostly listen to rock (most kinds but all pretty light, bands like steely dan and bastille), also some electronic stuff namely daft punk and justice.  i also don't mind a bit of hip hop but also jazz.  if it helps the albums ive been listening to recently are random access memories (daft punk), pure heroine (lorde), good kid maad city (kendrick lammar), speak no evil (wayne shorter) and nothing (NERD)."
LEIFey,AskMen,1391089001.0,"You're probably right that a lot of Askmen is not happy with their dating life, but that should be expected for a subreddit built upon asking men for dating advice. That being said, Askmen is not indicative of the average man, any more than Askwomen is indicative of the average woman. People in happy relationships generally don't need advice so they won't be represented here accurately, and we know that because Askmen is predominantly 18-25 and single. Talk about a biased sample.

And I think you're being rather dismissive of what women have to do to get anything out of dating and overblowing the work that men have to do. Just ask an unattractive woman how easy her dating life is. As for men, the things that women like about me are things that I was already doing for myself anyways, so I don't think I've put *any* time in apart from actually going out to meet girls.

Here in Europe, we get very nice prices. It's only my opinion, but I think it has to do with companies not being able to spread from country to country as easily as from state to state in the US. This means that there are several providers in each country, creating more competition and thus lower prices for better service.

Bad, Bad, bad.  you're a good looking guy and apparently you're very social.  And in the one picture you're by yourself, you've added a wig that makes you look 20 pound heavier.   You never want the majority of pictures in your profile to include other people.   Quickmatch does not show captions so people could be left guessing which person is you.  You especially do not want pictures with women because even it's your mom/sister a woman is comparing herself to that women.   Get some new pictures of you alone.. and make the main picture an example of what you will likely look like when you show up for a first date.

**Self-Summary**

Do not include off site contact information in your profile, ever.   Sure they can stalk you, but if they actually then add you, you get to see/stalk them.  Bad.

Flip basketball and the politician paragraph, then elaborate on what position you'd play on an NBA team.

**what you are doing with your life**

Good.. but you spend every summer in Israel, how does that figure into your future life plans?  I could be wrong, but going there every summer makes it seem you are likely to continue.  Any plan to emigrate?

**really good at**

Do not tell a prospective date that you will beat them at anything.

Stick with admitting your are a highly competitive person.

Are you good at anything that makes you a better dating prospect?  

**First thing**

Friendly presence that cannot be ignored, awesome

I'll probably be your best friend in 5 minutes, horrible, you just passed go and drove way into trying too hard ville..

**Favorites**

Solid list.. can you expand a bit more on food?  It's an area where a date can picture themselves out with you and start thinking of you as a prospect.. right now they only get to imagine you together out for fast food or at your grandmother's house.

**six things** 

Good list.

**thinking about**

Not bad.  And yes, the Bar exam will torture you.  Hopefully it will only torture you once, you'll pass and be on with your life.

**Friday** 

Not bad.. clean it up a little.

**private**

Solid!  That is a good hook for conversation and very cute.

**message me**

Nice.. short, to the  point.   get the rest of the profile up to speed and it may not require anything more.

**overall**

This is your introduction letter.   Would you skimp on grammar, punctuation, actually putting the apostrophe in I'm on your introduction letter to a big sports agency you want to intern at?

You don't need to sound formal, this is a dating introduction, but you do need to put the effort into looking like you care enough about this to make a solid effort.  No abbreviations, clear sentences, and written with the care it deserves if the best date in your life might come out of it."

zeroable,funny,1391089463.0,"Sorry, just a nitpicky and fairly off-topic point here about Catholicism and the saints. I was raised Catholic (I'm not religious now, though) and had 13 years of Catholic school. 

My theology teachers always made a clear distinction between *worshipping* which is for God (made up of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) and *honoring* which is for angels/saints/etc. The distinction is a fine one, and one that is hard to describe. It's a distinction that the Catholic Church is very invested in, but that many non-Catholic groups dispute, and one that atheists would likely find superfluous.

Worship kind of assumes that God has power and ability to directly answer requests, while honoring just shows respect. When Catholics pray to God it's worship as there's often an element of praise, and there's a recognition that God can do whatever the heck He/She wants. When they pray to Mary or the saints, they don't call on the intrinsic, independent power of the saints, but rather ask the saints to pass on their requests to God. 

Basically, when you pray to God, it's like asking the governor for a stay of execution. When you pray to Mary, it's like asking your buddy the lieutenant governor to ask the governor on your behalf for a stay of execution.

Reagansmash1994,writing,1391089483.0,"I'm studying Journalism at the moment, and it is useful for a number of reasons.

1. It isn't easy making a blog reputable, it takes a lot of work. Not anyone can do it and while some people without degrees do, the chances of anyone being able to is very limited.

2. The things you learn in the first year will be the basic elements of making a good news story. The pyramid, hook, angle, how to write good headlines, sub headers, how to sub-edit, correct interview style, feature writing etc. these are all the basic elements of news writing and turn a blogger into a real reporter.

3. A journalism degree (or similar i.e. English) is expected by almost all reputable news sources or magazines. Unless you're talented and merely missed the boat on a degree, a reputable source wont really hire you based on your CV alone. It shows you actually know what you're doing. Unless, of course, you managed to get relevant experience. But a degree in journalism (or english etc.) will result in the right experience as well.

4. Connections. A degree is a door to endless connections. Your lecturers will be first, but then there are ex students, guest speakers, current students, other courses. It's a door to a world that will be invaluable for you later in life.

5. Placements. The majority of placements at magazines etc. are opened to Undergraduate and Postgraduate students only, a journalism degree is only more helpful depending on the placement you're going for. For example, I have gotten a placement at the magazine SFX this summer, this will be a source of invaluable experience that will help me get a job later.

**TLDR: A journalism degree is a much easier route into the industry and much more beneficial for you.**

Note: Quickly typed up, poor punctuation/grammar

EDIT: A couple people here think it's useless and you can do anything without the degree, which isn't true. If you're not sure about a path in Journalism, do an English degree. But if you're keen on entering the industry, a Journalism degree is a great choice. Speak to any magazine editor, or current crop of writers (around your age) and the majority of them will tell you a degree in journalism is invaluable. I've spoken to enough to know this.

EDIT 2: Also, what are these reputable news blogs you're speaking about, where the writers have no education in the subject of writing or journalism? Anybody who knows journalistic writing will be able to point out the flaws in their pieces and disregard it as 'reputable'.

Edit 3: Also remember that Journalism is a very hard industry to get into, so a degree can only be helpful.

Edit 4: Also, if you do go down the degree route, choose a Uni course that is recognised by the NCTJ.

Chocobean,Christianity,1391089999.0,"&gt; To me, it often seems the people that reserve the most hate for homos are the average Christian and Muslim fanatics.

&gt;Even worse is the fact a sizable proportion of Xtians believe being gay is the big ""E"" word(evil).

&gt;It is personally very important to convert to a proper Christian church, not a fake one.

I'm an average Christian, a conservative one, at that. I'm not part of the UC and I disagree on their views regarding some small issues, but calling them a fake church is very offensive to me. 

I don't believe there is any sin that is deserving of a big ""E"", be it homosexuality, apostasy, mass murder or blasphemy. In the face of perfect beauty and perfection, the smallest, least offensive insult to another person is as awful as torturing a million souls. It matters only what you do after your coming to Christ. 

If you are sincere and not just trolling for vitriol, do not ask these questions. Who cares what Christians believe about gays even if your very broad stroke statements are true? Are you convinced that there is one God, that he sent his one son, Jesus, to die on the cross so that man's sins may be forgiven?

VoxMeretricis,sex,1391090127.0,"Well, I've always loved studying history - the Middle Ages in particular fascinates me because it is a time of intense contradictions. On the one hand, some of the shit that went down is mind-bogglingly crazy. I'm thinking of a 13th century women's medical text called the Trotula (based on Galen's medicinal theories, as opposed to Artistotle) that says one sure-fire remedy for excessive bleeding is to take a hunk of bacon and tie it around your torso. Science!

On the other hand, I'm thinking of Marsilius of Padua's 1324 text Defensor Pacis, which was a radical political text that basically said that Church was an institution that could suggest moral practices but needed to stay the hell out of political life, and should always be separate from the state. 

On the one hand, I think of the lives lost because of religious dissent in the European Inquisition (not to be confused with the later Spanish Inquisition). On the other, I think of the way in which the excellent papal scholars and lawyers of the Inquisition laid the groundwork for our own legal procedures today - it is through the Inquisition that the old framework of trial by ordeal is dismantled and new procedures including the calling of witnesses, the recording of testimony, and open court procedures were created.

On the one hand, the Inquisition tortured and then burned people alive. On the other, each death was a *failure*. Inquisitors were, by and large, not the wildly sadistic monsters they've been portrayed as, with exceptions of course. Their manuals and writings generally suggest they are intelligent, sensitive people who genuinely, not cynically, believed that they were saving souls. They truly believed they were defending their flock - and can we say today that we do not do truly horrific things in defense of ourselves and our people? Each person that was burned was a soul that was lost, and there are quite moving reflections on their own failure when that happens. 

The Middle Ages is a period in our history of intense difference from us. If you believe that nurture has any part in shaping us as well as nature, the psychological world in which people were born, lived, and died, is so alien to us in so many ways that the period provides an endless litany of exciting avenues for historians to explore. And yet, at the same time, I've learned that there are many similarities as well. There is savagery and tenderness, superstition and genius. People were so intensely *alive*, no matter which side of the spectrum they fell on. "

ANewMachine615,conspiracy,1391090419.0,"Lead is different, as it accumulates in the body over time and causes progressive symptoms as a result. Fluoride, as you point out, is capable of being filtered out of the body.

Also, ""slightly higher concentrations"" giving ""harmful measurable effects"" is a vast exaggeration. The upper limit on fluoride in the water supply in the US, as per the EPA, is 4 ppm. The optimal level is is 0.7-1.2 ppm. The study that most people cite as evidence of harm from fluoride (the IQ meta-study) had instances of fluoride content as high as 11.5 ppm (nearly 3 times the legal limit, and over 10x the optimal range). Even with such high levels of fluoridation, the study still observed an effect that is likely within the measurement error for IQ tests. Not only that, but the meta-study itself admitted that its sub-studies were largely less than optimal, because they had few indications of actual fluoride exposure, did not control for or test for other possible contaminants, and did not control for schooling or nutrition -- y'know, the major known factors in IQ variance.

So, yeah, I'm gonna say that no harmful effects to IQ have been shown. The major side effects of fluoride over-exposure are dental fluorosis (slight discoloration and softening of teeth) and, in higher-concentration cases, skeletal fluorosis, which can cause weaker bones. But the exposure required is, again, several times the legal upper limit for fluoridation, so I'm not sure how it's relevant to bring up when discussing water fluoridation.

Meanwhile, levels of fluoridation below 4 ppm show very little dental fluorosis, and much lower levels of dental caries in children and those with limited access to dental health. It's a pretty dramatic, low-cost, low-to-no-detriment public health program that I can't understand why people deny and oppose so vociferously."

That being said, I do find certain cultures and behaviors to be abhored and not to be respected to any degree because of my morals, but I understand that they feel the same way about me.

Of course, any sort of law should come from a different angle entirely and ignore my morality if it doesn't support justice IMO"

Colres,explainlikeimfive,1391090495.0,"It's amazing that you can see as much as you can. The reason you're not seeing the same detail as the camera is in bright light the cones in your eye are active, which detect color and sharper detail but require a substantial amount of data to activate. In dim light, only the rods in your eyes are active, which can't see the same range of colour but requires as little as six photons to activate. 

Your eyes are also taking in far less light. There's no exact framerate of the eye, in fact a cell will only activate the next cell when turned off, so each individual cell is firing on its own as light reaches and stops reaching it. A camera on the other hand can have its sensor open for several seconds (or even longer, depending on the camera). When light enters the camera, photons hit the sensor and settle in grooves. Simply put the deeper the groove the more room for photons before the image gets washed out. The difference in timeframe is what makes so much more detail available to a camera."
Swlotr1,Catholicism,1391090496.0,"/r/NoFap may help you with abstinence, but I think it's useless to do so without properly knowing why you are doing it. In my experience, saying no to sin is just the first step of a much harder road.

What you are ultimately going for is not just not masturbating, but understanding how our sexuality works and embracing it is part of ourselves, how God intended us to be. For me, masturbation just reflects sexual immaturity, egoism and the lack of integrity of our self. Once you start addressing these problems, masturbation practically starts disappearing.
   
Reading, meditation, praying contribute towards this goal. I highly recommend you read John Paul II's Theology of the body, at least the beginners version (http://www.amazon.com/Theology-The-Body-For-Beginners/dp/1932645349). Understanding how we are called to love chastely is what gave me the biggest motivation to grow on this aspect.

Avoiding opportunities for sin is also very important. I don't think this needs much clarification. Praying the Rosary every day and asking our Mother for a purity of heart helps IMMENSELY. I always ask for purity of heart so I will be able to love my future wife with the dignity and love she deserves, when the time comes. I don't think you can give you future spouse a better gift.

Enjoy life. Engage in social activities where you can interact with the opposite gender, so you can learn to see them as God's daughters, your sisters, human beings. Looking someone in the eyes reminds me there it is not just a body standing there, but also a soul. Discuss it often with your priest, and when you fail, don't beat yourself up. Go to confession, recognize you can't do this on your own, and ask God for the strength to follow his path. It's worth it! 

Feel free to ask more questions if you seek more help. Keep it up!"

It wrecks all sorts of havoc on relationships: putting someone on a pedestal, emotional co-dependency, stagnation of personal growth....wanting another human being to fill a certain void is usually not a good starting point. 

You're 20. As much as I don't like Dan Savage's bigotry around Christians, I totally agree with him that ""it gets better"". Sexuality isn't as black and white as some people think it is. You'll come to enjoy ""people"" as ""people"", and not as potential dates or whatever. You'll come to make friends, male and female.

GetOffMyLawn_,Hypothyroidism,1391090657.0,"Both antidepressants and BC can lead to weight gain and just dropping them doesn't automatically lead to weight loss. What's weird is that you've been taking thyroid pills and have gained weight. What numbers are you getting back from your thyroid labs? Also, hypo usually only accounts for about 10-15 pounds of added weight so I am not sure where the 95 came from, even with the AD and BC.

The problem most people have is underestimating calories consumed and overestimating calories burned through exercise. Get an app like MyFitnessPal (also available on the web) and start tracking your consumption and exercise. Get a food scale and strictly track your portions. [Calculate your TDEE.](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/) Read labels on food. Don't fall for fads, it's calories in and calories out. I don't think you are going to lose 50 pounds in 7 months. 1 pound a week is much more realistic. So 7 months * 4 weeks/month = 28 pounds.

Don't do intense cardio if you can't handle it. Go for endurance for now. Walk but walk longer. An hour a day every day. Consistency is key. If you can't breathe 2 minutes into a workout you're doing it wrong. Maybe you're trying too hard. Try exercising at the bottom of your training range instead of the top. Or find a trainer.

There are weight loss subs here. Start with /r/loseit. They have links to other weight loss subs and diets. 

Also, these won't help you with your weight loss but they will help your Hashi's symptoms. I used to have chest pain and breathing difficulty during any kind of physical exertion. After 3 days on selenium it went away. If I stop taking it the symptoms come back so I have been taking it for a year and a half now. Vitamin D helps my energy and depression.

-	Selenium - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20883174. Take 200 mcg of selenomethionine daily.

Then, after all the misery and suffering and chaos and death, there might be a huge push by what remains of civilization to start producing biofuel, because it would be easier to do that and use it with existing, remaining infrastructure, than to develop a whole new infrastructure.

With populations cut be huge fractions, it might even be possible to produce a long-term energy-sustainable industry. Then time would pass, we would grow our numbers again, and start stretching resources again. Those more powerful and/or less scrupulous would never have ceased seeking more power and using all means to maintain it.

We would end up where we started, after decades, maybe centuries of suffering.

ronearc,AskCulinary,1391090861.0,"Before switching to brining things like pork chops, I'd cook them low and slow with a reverse sear until about 135, and then sear them, bringing them up to 145. 

And I was happy with that method. 

But once I started brining them, they were even more moist, and I enjoyed them more. 

You can tell me scientifically that I've just added water and reduced flavor, but I can tell you aesthetically that I prefer the results of the brining method. 

Edit: For what it's worth, I also still do reverse sear, cooked slowly for brined pork chops. "

ANewMachine615,law,1391090881.0,"In the US, you need to pass the bar exam to become an attorney. To sit for the bar exam, you will need a Juris Doctor degree from a law school. To get into a law school, you will need a bachelor's degree of some sort.

During law school, you will want to focus on procedure, pre-trial advocacy, trial advocacy (though most cases like this will settle, you will have some trials), and clinical work.

That said, I wager there are far more effective ways to honor your mother than spending $250,000 or so to become one small part of a system that sometimes gets a monetary-only settlement for the bereaved families. Becoming a grief counselor, or safety inspector, or pushing for better enforcement of the existing safety standards in your town, or what have you."

&gt;The hardest part to solve can be performance as the global forum could end up receiving ~3x traffic compared to the currently most active forum.

I dunno about that. This global forums purpose should mainly be for gathering feedback for the designers. As long as they stick to that there shouldn't be such a huge traffic.

Besides, why would they spend a lot of resources when they can just do what they're doing now, or simply use Reddit? Having a global forum would be great, and they should have probably implemented it in the first place. But it's too late now. There's some fallacy there."

hornwalker,DebateAnAtheist,1391090953.0,"&gt; In addition the Constitution states that every person has inalienable god given rights, namely the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Why should we protect the rights of those who don't contribute anything to the world?

Remember that the constitution is just a social contract and a statement of intent from the founding fathers, among other things..  Also bear in mind at the time it was written it only applied to white privileged males.     That said, we should protect the rights of those who don't contribute because if we don't agree that *all* humans have some baseline rights(life, free speech, freedom of religion, etc.)  then we would be shooting ourselves in the foot and might find someday that someone tries to take those rights away from us.  Whether or not we contribute to society is irrelevant.  "
Jourdin,AskWomen,1391090954.0,"I don't agree with your first sentence. Radical feminism is about being critical of queer politics, but not necessarily exclusive of trans people. You also need to realize that misogyny does an extreme amount of harm as well, and has been doing that harm since the LGBT movement even began. As well, transphobia itself stems from misogyny, because misogynists hate and fear women in all forms, trans or not. So your blame is misdirected; misogynists are still to blame, not radical feminists. We did not come up with the idea/belief that trans people and women are to be discriminated against; that can be, for the most part, accredited to straight white upper-class men.

PIV sex being rape is another misinterpretation of radfem theory. Again, I encourage you to read books and articles about the *theory itself*, not tumblr blogs or wherever you're getting this information from. Radfem theory regarding heterosexual sex, the BDSM scene, porn, and other related topics encourages being critical of these things and understanding that *everything we do and believe* is influenced by the [patriarchal] society in which we live, because we cannot escape it. I don't think that's a very extreme view, do you? In fact, it's pretty much the basis for developing one's sociological perspective (realizing that we are all influenced/biased), and it's probably quite agreeable that sociology is a neutral and (and therefore incapable of being hateful) social science.

Regarding your last paragraph, again, I don't know what you're reading or how you're interpreting it but I am guessing you're not in the right place. I'm sorry you still think that it's an accurate comparison. Oh well. At the very least I am glad we were able to keep this conversation civil, so thank you for that.

Metamucil. Active ingredient is psyllium. You can take it up to 3 times a day. I take it once a day. Store brand equivalents are available. It also comes in capsules but I don't recommend capsules. You have to take way too many for an effective dose. They're useful if you're someplace where you can't mix up a glass of the powdered stuff.

You can get plain psyllium at the health food store. It makes me gag but it works. I think it also comes in capsules but then you have to take lots of capsules to get a decent dose.

FiberCon capsules work well and are easier to take than Metamucil but don't work as well. It is also a fiber supplement but not psyllium.

Citrucel works. There are no store brand equivalents that I know of so it's expensive.  It's also a fiber supplement but not psyllium. It also comes in capsules but I don't recommend capsules.

All of the above are soluble fiber. You want some insoluble fiber as well, things like wheat bran and brown rice. More vegetables. More fruit.

Please quote where I said a percentage of over 65 people don't qualify for medicare/ medicaid. I think you'll find you're a moron.

I said older people, not all people approaching 65 can afford healthcare - the bills are extortionate.

&gt;And you're so clueless that you don't know that the vast majority of issues with lack of insurance are in the 22-32 yr old range. So before it was: all these old people who die from not being able to pay bills (which, again you ignore because you're a hyperbolic clueless shithead), and now its: some...I think...though Im not citing any data. lol

Please quote the source for the assetion you just made 22-32 year olds eh? Wheres the source, you just throw bullshit out there and hope it sticks don't you?

YOU don't know the first thing about the issues except for the things you think you heard one time on Reddit. You think you're teaching anybody jack shit about US health care when you're so laughably ignorant about the situation? lolololol 3. Im for universal health care, you stupid little stereotypical eurotrash twit, but I'm not going to get into the actual issues with an absolutely laughable know nothing like yourself.

1. Who gives a shit, loads of places in europe are shitholes?

2. I know a lot more than you do, where did you study economics again, how many years have you studied politics?

3. You're a bit of a fucking idiot then, you've made no effort to look at the issues, you debate like a small child in terms of intelligence and maturity.

&gt; You don't know jack shit about the US health care system or the issues unique to the US or why its more expensive than the rest of the world or how the the rest of the world depends on the US for its meds and research, etc. Know how I know that? You'll deny it in your next typically idiotic comment. You're a dime a dozen.

The US isn't bad for it's research, at no point did I mention medical research. You're a fucking idiot bringing up irrelevant points because you're too thick to form a coherent reply.

&gt;Oh so now that I provide the actual numbers you're citing them? lololololo yet again. What happened to all those people dying?!?!?!?! THEY'RE DYING!!!!!! Again you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about. They have access to health care...its the expense thats the problem you absolute twit.

You quoted 15% of Americans without healthcare, 47 million people without healthcare. I'm guessing a fair few of those will die young.

If you have no money, you have no healthcare. 
They won't treat non emergency cases if the person cannot pay, people won't seek diagnosis if they can't pay for it. This leads to health issues growing in severity, curable diseases progressing to the point of no return.

If you cannot see this causes deaths, you're a moron quite frankly.

&gt;Why don't you get back to jacking off to /r/politics or Noam Chomsky while pretending whatever shitty country you come from has perfect health care that doesn't largely depend on the US. Do me a favor since our health care system is so bad, please lobby your country to stop using our tech and meds and research....only use whatever you produce in your own country. We'll see how awesome it works out for you.

My country has the NHS, our healthcare is good, it isn't perfect (and I never said it was, go look back at my posts, idiot). Our country outputs some of the finest medical research in the world - some public funded, some private funded.

Everyone has the right to healthcare and it's cheaper all round - no one is making a profit on something which people should all have the right to. If you're to go private, you are paying more for your health insurance than it would ever cost in taxes to run the same service.

Man you're stupid, and arrogant. Did you even attend university? I'm guessing no judging by your general level of intelligence and inability to make an argument stick together."

I had my toddlers with me, and the conversation started by them asking if I want another, and that they no way in hell want one and anybody who does is being illogical. I said, well, yes, my faith convinced me to do it, and yes it would be totally illogical and irresponsible if I didn't have reasons of faith to have a kid. Then the attack on faith, and Christianity, in general, started. It wasn't personal, they were just being very honest, but it was what I did not consider polite or true. But I stayed calm, and just asserted that yes, if Christianity isn't true for me, I would totally agree with you. Because I would. There but by the grace of God go I.

harle,ffxiv,1391091692.0,"Triples are generally better if the item has a low cost to manufacture (eg., hi-potions); if you are able to reliably HQ; or if you want to milk the most gil out of a single leve. Alchemy is really good at printing money, as some of the crafts result in 3-5 items with a very low cost profile. Couriers are generally better if the base item is more expensive to produce, and you can mitigate the teleport fees, opting for single item turn in for approx the same XP as a full triple leve (up to 10% higher in some cases).

For couriers, cost mitigation is paramount. Airships for 120g to cross hubs, use of 40g ferries, favorited locations, and the FC buff will determine if you break even or slightly profit. But due to the time required for courier leves, I would say that they're best used for leveling only.

**Crafting**

So, now we look at which triple leves and which couriers people are liable to use, and then at the material costs. You want to avoid anything with a high base cost, as that will eat into your profit. eg., leve items with Shark oil in their ingredients. Shark oil is almost always better to just sell on its own. Processing cost + material rarity, added to cost of the other materials makes it wholly unprofitable. Even if you can eke out slight profit selling HQ to other players, there are many items with much wider profit margins.

* Yoyo, hold up, I'm confused - how about some examples?

Take the [CRP L35-45 leves](http://craftingasaservice.com/leve#CRP|35|45|Town,Field,Courier,Reverse%20Courier|0|||). L35 triple are Walnut Macahootles. Here, Wyvern Obsidian is worthless rock and Walnut lumber is pretty similar in value. They'd be great to pump a few dozen of, if the market isn't saturated with them already (check first).

The L35 Courier has Fish Glue. Fish Glue is gelatinous gold. Like many of the ALC component crafts, it sells high. Not a good choice.

L40 triple Mythril Lance is soso. Depends on the cost on your server. Mythril ingots soso, Boar Leather soso to high, Oak Lumber worthless. But it has a relatively high reward for a triple leve. If you can pass the cost onto the buyer, perhaps try it.

L45 triple is Mahogany lumber. That just prints gil on turn-in, but lumber itself is relatively worthless. The others have expensive mats in them. 

If you're doing leves for xp and you get to a tier like CRP L40, it's also sometimes worthwhile to skip that tier completely if you're able to craft the previous tier for relatively no cost in comparison, although it will eat more leves. Something to consider.


* Are you crafting with the intent to turn them in yourself?

Check the AH first. If it's a staple item like Mahogany lumber, chances are people after Luminaries synth'd a ton of them and are selling it quite cheaply. If the base materials are more than what the leve rewards, pick a new leve.

* Are you crafting them to sell to others?

Check the AH first. Ascertain the total cost of the materials involved, whether people are selling the respective parts cheaper than cost-to-craft, whether people are selling the HQ result cheaper or with a very slim margin, than cost to craft. Avoid if so.

If you're unable to reliably HQ veer away from selling to others, or stick to crafting items well under your current level for the decrease in difficulty. Focus on either leveling up more DoH classes, or limit your efforts to items you see realistic profit in. Yarns and undyed cloth bases, for example, are often still profitable as they're derived soley from gatherables. 
Alternatively, you could turn in the ones you NQ and sell the HQ ones on the AH.

A key part of the crafting system in FFXIV are the cross-class skills you will obtain and be able to make use of. The vast majority of the items I've crafted HQ were using a mish-mash of the same L20-30 gear. But this was possible because of obtaining new cross-class abilities which vastly simplified the process and expanded the available resources, without requiring a heavy gear investment. As an aside, it was literally only today that I crafted myself a 50 set, having finally leveled WVR. It may be more of a priority if you plan to focus on SB accs or higher level crafts.

The major shift from 2.0 to 2.1 is that instead of relying on the ability to craft HQ 2-stars, which the market is quite saturated with now, you profit more from supplying other crafters
 with core components and consumables. With this as a focus, there's no requirement to have a melded set, much less a 50 set at all outside of your AF tool, as you're focusing on lower-level items. While there is still profit in 2-stars, I don't find them ideal because of time spent relisting them, mass undercutting, low sale rate and higher entry cost (to be able to craft them).



**Gatherables/Mob drops**

Many items required for crafting are simply unattainable from vendors. The rarer of which will sell at decent price to other crafters. 

If you're leveling a DoL, consider grinding core gatherables instead of burning leves to level. Longer yes, but far more profitable, and will get you a solid material base to start crafting with. When crafting anything from these base materials, check the AH to see if it's more efficient cost-wise (factoring in shards, 5% AH tax) to sell the base item &amp; buy the result from another player. eg. 3x logs @ 60g ea, 5x shards @ 14g ea: cost-to-craft is 250g/lumber, but lumber is 25g ea on AH.

Core mobs to farm (with your 50, no drop penalty) are L16-17 goats east of Camp Drybone, Apkallu along the Bloodshore in Costa-del-Sol, L35-37 ish sheep around Camp Dragonhead, Golden Fleece far east of Camp Drybone, and raptors west of Central Shroud, among others. Their mats fluctuate as with anything on the AH, but all are used in key crafts.

* Everyone says time is money, and this applies ingame just as much.  

Weigh the time it takes you to gather a material vs the cost of buying another material off the AH.

Eg., Silver ore. Right now it's ~20g ea on my server. Silver Ingots are ~160g. I need a ton of silver ingots. Do I: 

a) Buy 160g ingots

b) Buy 20g ores x99

c) Gather 20g ores

d) Gather something else expensive and sell it to fund the ores

B or D makes sense to me. If I'm able to go shoot goats for 120g/horn + 40g/skin, or whack rocks and get G1 Carbon at 80g, or whatever other ore - why waste 60g/swing gathering silver? Likewise, the cost of the ingot is far above the cost to make it.

* Check out the class quest lists for BTN + MIN

More items that will always be in demand.

**Mitigate your costs**

* Teleporting racks up

So make use of your favorite destinations. I've set mine at Hawthorne Hut, Costa del Sol, and Camp Drybone, return point to Mor Dhona. This gives me access to all the zones. Hawthorne for Sylph dailies, as well as map mining just north of the outpost. Costa is 40g away from Limsa via ferry (so 80g away from Aleport/Upper Noscea), 40g away from the ferry to Wineport/Coil - but you can also zone in to Coil simply by being in Costa as it's still the same map. Plus Apkallu farm. Camp Drybone gives access to goats, sheep, gold ore, alumen, and Uldah via chocobo.

If you're in a hub city, hoof it to the airship rather than directly TPing to a different hub.

* Once you level various crafts, use Dark Matter to repair.

It costs ~1.5-1.8k to fully repair my endgame set.

In comparison, Dark Matter g5 is ~15-20g each atm, allowing a full repair for next to nothing.

* Don't repair the items you're SBing unless they break.

With 1 materia slotted on a NQ item 0-star, you should be able to convert it before it breaks, unless you've died a lot. 

Summing it up
-
* Endgame DoW/M market supersaturated, hard to move big ticket items in good time.  

* If you plan to craft for profit, take the time to research profit margins.

* When crafting to sell, balance cost-to-craft against rate of sale (via listing history), against current listings.


* Generally, consumables (leves/class/food) over more permanent pieces or random weapons.

* Don't be afraid of burning leves on NQ items, if it's possible to get them at absurdly low prices.

* If you're having trouble reliably HQing things, which is perhaps the most solid way to create value, level up another DoH class to unlock more skills.

* Don't write off Spiritbinding~

The rest of this is based on things I've heard rather than seen myself so some might be wrong. Originally theredpill was a group with similar beliefs to pick up artists, but applying them to more areas of life than dating/sex. Around the same time the mens rights movement was divided between those who thought there were a number of downsides to the traditional male gender role that should be removed and those that considered those downsides noble sacrifices and believed that the benefits should be increased as a reward for those sacrifices. Around five years ago there was an influx of the first type which led to a strugle over the direction of MRM that made a lot of the second type leave, and alot of them ended up joining /r/theredpill creating the modern version of it which mixes the worst of the MRM, PUA and social conservativism."

And as I pointed out before, our minds **don't** have ready access to the deep structure of the universe. It took centuries of hard work to even gain a dim understanding of the deep structure of the universe.

Other things you can do to give yourself that confidence boost is sweet lady liquor when you're in social situations, watching something like Seinfeld to get your social buzz on (don't do this myself, but I've heard people give this advice on a number of occasions) and even playing video games that get you pumped (or better yet sports and exercise) before doing things will temporarily boost your confidence. There's a study on the video games thing but I'm too lazy to find it right now.

What about the fact that 1 war ended with another ending under his presidency? I'd like to see some citations on what exact regulations he's responsible for before I take that as evidence.  As for the EPA, they have also de-regulated and astonishing levels, I don't recall the exact source but they have been rejecting regulation requests more than at any point.  Also, I like the EPA, why the fuck wouldn't I want an organization regulating the destruction of our environment? What's wrong with you?  As far as congress, they're worthless.  I don't like the precedent he's setting by going around them by any means, but he's only using the powers that were put in place by executives since Lincoln.  When congress leaves him with no choice by obstructing all legislation he's going to use the executive powers granted his office.  

I don't like Obama.  I think he's a shite president.  I just don't think he's the demon he is made out to be.

edit: With regard to bypassing congress, here is something from snopes:

&gt;the number of executive orders issued by President Obama is grossly exaggerated here. Through the first five years of his presidency (i.e., as of 20 January 2014) the count of all executive orders issued by President Obama was 168, not 923. Moreover, compared to President Obama's predecessors in the White House, this is not an unusually large number of orders for a modern president: President George W. Bush issued 291 executive orders during his eight years in office, while President Bill Clinton issued 364 such orders over the same span of time.

Many years ago these two congregations merged.

Many writers do, this is true. But the majority of up and coming editors etc. have a journalism degree. The editors of big magazine publications have a degree in journalism (or english etc.)

To write the degree off as useless is wrong as it is a respected degree in the field. Many students on my course have been offered interneships at publications around the world, which they otherwise wouldn't have been open to without being an undergrad or postgrad journalist.

It is very much an important degree if you're planning on going into the field. Of course you can learn everything on your own, I have spent a huge part of my course getting certificates in Photoshop, In Design and learning coding (for a certain module). You can learn all this on your own, but for some the degree route is easier and is an accredited route with something at the end of all the learning.

GeneParmesanCheese,relationships,1391093261.0,"Don't rush dating.  You need to get over this relationship and figure out who you are as an individual and what type of person you want to be in a relationship with before you go out trying to meet someone new.  I think your impulse now is to avoid being alone, and that never works out well.  You're in no shape for a healthy relationship.  

If you just want to hook up, then do it.  But be honest about your intentions and don't fall in ~~love~~ lust.  Again, you're in no shape.

From the perspective of a woman in a long term relationship with a single father, I can offer you a few tips.  Basically, a lady in a relationship with you is not going to be into it if you don't have a separate life from your ex.  No woman will want to feel like a sister-wife:

* Get a custody order worked out so that you are not depending on your ex to kindly grant you time with your daughter.  That can turn into a controlling tactic if your ex becomes unhappy with you.  And, yes, this can happen even if she was the one to call off the relationship.  Something about the other parent of your kid moving on romantically tends to bring out the drama.  Formalize as much as you can formalize to limit your stress levels in the future.  My SO did not do this, because they co-parented ""amicably"".  That was until I came along, and now all hell has broken loose because his ex cannot accept that she is not the central figure in his life anymore.  Formalizing matters will also limit the amount of conflict that your daughter might observe in the future, and that is important.

* Don't do ""family"" things like going to your ex's house for your time with your kid.  Acknowledge the separateness of you and your ex, and that ""family"" is no longer.  Your daughter is your family, your daughter is your ex's family, but you and your ex are no longer family.  Your daughter will do fine having two separate and happy parents, especially since she is young enough to not remember when her parents were together.  And if you find a new special lady friend that you are happy with, she will not feel like an intruder in your life.  Hanging onto the vestiges of the relationship you had just because you have a child will exclude anyone new.

* Don't rush introducing a girlfriend to your daughter.  You can wait until you're sure things are serious and lasting, because you don't want your daughter to get attached to someone who is not going to stick around.  Or your daughter might be young enough that you can introduce ""daddy's friend"" and just don't have your girlfriend around your daughter so much that she gets attached.  

Basically, take some time off to heal and acknowledge the reality of the situation.  Separation is important if you ever want to move on with your life and have a new #1 (adult) lady in your life.  "

It takes quite a bit of planning and time for food prep, and you have to be willing to not eat much meat, but it can be done.  Plus, we switched from a juicer to the nurti-bullet, which uses the whole fruit and veggie, so it saves a ton of money.

He is still very perceptive when he is horny.  He just didn't care about your feelings.  Really really bad sign.   And he was willing and chose to do this to you.  He isn't some caveman that can't control himself just because he is horny.  He's just in damage control right now.  

I would suggest that you call off the engagement because you should not marry someone willing to treat you this way.

Then lunch time hit and it turns out the extractor fan is broken and the only window is fucking tiny as hell. Also, it seemed like every customer only ordered burgers, so the grill is constantly going and doesn't get a chance to be properly cleaned, meaning the smoke builds up without ever clearing.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1391093628.0,"&gt; I am just wondering how I should stop this insecurity about not having been with a girl and just accept myself for who I am.

the question is: are you attracted to women? are you attracted to men (other than the ones who are showing you attention currently)? be honest with yourself first and foremost. when you masturbate, do you use porn or imagine yourself with someone specific? if you use porn, what do you watch and what do you enjoy?

once you know who you are attracted to (men, women, both) then begin to explore your interests.

as for the regret, how much of that is regret for being with a man and how much is regret for being with someone you don't really know? find someone that you are attracted to, who is attracted to you, and then explore what interests you. sex is always better when it's with someone you have an interest in.

**photos**

If you keep playing with your facial hair, you will want to keep your profile photos in rotation so that your primary photo looks like you do now.. if you were to walk into a coffee shop today, what would you look like.  *that* is what your primary photo should show.

**Self-Summary**

Every single paragraph.. I feel that I'm an alien, I'm a introvert, I'm an INTJ.  Really, dead horse beat it some more.

Positive BEFORE the negative, if negative needs to be included at all, and positive should outweigh the negative.

I enjoy meeting and spending time with people as well as going out and socializing even though I am, by nature, an introvert and need to recharge sometimes so I can come off as shy.

I'm into theater, stage production and psychology *then* you're an intj and sometimes feel a bit alien or more feel like you're an observer rather than a participant which is likely easier to understand then you're an alien.

**What you're doing with your life**

Non profit good, helping people good, what the hell is the non profit and what do you do there?  No need for exact names/details if you're worried about your privacy but it feels like there should be at least a tiny bit more detail and then leave the rest for messages/conversation.

long term plans excellent and written well.  Lots of hooks/conversation starters here.

**really good at**

Awesome!  Really Awesome.  Though maybe Mike Symon instead of Gordon Ramsey unless you really do swear that much.

include one picture of your bead creations in your second album, or if you are really proud of them make a third album.. this could be a fun conversation starter.

**first things**

Not bad.. now get one profile picture that actually gets close enough to see your eye color.. your current main profile picture almost gets there.  It doesn't have to be a close up of your eyeball, make the lady squint at the picture, but let that squinting pay off.

**Favorites**

I love books, plural, not I love book.

key to your heart, not key to your hear

Also, try and include some other cuisines, favorite dishes or favorite restarants.  Let her place herself across from the table eating pasta with you.. just maybe one or two added specifics.

**six things**

Solid list

**thinking about** 

Excellent.. good variety and just enough humor.  Good hooks for starting conversations with you.

**Friday** 

Also excellent..  maybe list a favorite table top game or two, or just the latest favorite of you and your friends.

**Private**

Nice conversation starter.. be prepared for the bronie question.

**Message me**

Fun list, not too limiting and highlight aspects of your personality that have been featured through the rest of the profile.

**Overall**

In the next month or two, I'm going to have to explain to him that I don't want to go to the school he has planned for me. I'm done with Community College this semester, and if he has his way, I'll be driving ~6 hours round trip every day to take classes at a school that I've never even been to because we can't afford for me to live up there. 

Not only that, but I'll probably have to take out massive loans in my own name to afford it all. I don't even know if I want the degree I've been working towards, but I'm not in any position to stand up and say ""NO"" because I have $30 in my bank account and no job to speak of.

Breakfast_King,AskMen,1391094095.0,"You need to own this.  Do not let Marfans define who you are.  It sounds like you are doing everything you can to fight it.  Keep that up!  Doctors are going to continue to be part of your life.

Your silver lining is that you know what symptoms to look for.  Be vigilant.  Paranoia is usually unhealthy, but with something that can be so urgent you don't want to take chances.  This sounds like the way you are probably already behaving.  What you need to remember, though, is that you've got this under as much control as you possibly can.  If you feel the signs, worry about them.  Just don't let them consume you when they aren't there.

I want to focus on that dream.  It may appear to be a nightmare, but it sounds to me like it's much more than that.  In this dream, you have found the ""perfect woman"".  You're content, you're happy, life's good.  And in this dream, your Marfans beats you.  Your wife is in hysterics and you are lucid for the whole experience.

This is going to sound dark, but keep up.  This is not a nightmare.  This is your ambition.  This isn't a dream, this is The Dream.  You experience true happiness.  You have somebody there that cares about you and will be upset when you're gone.  These are things missing from your life that you clearly want more than anything else.  This isn't ""everything ripped away from you"".  This is everything being given to you.

Every successful marriage ends in death.  That's what you sign up for.  The hard part is the successful marriage.

You can only deal with Marfans so much.  Let where you are right now be the low point of your life.  Let it be what you have nightmares about years from now.  Go out there and make (most of) that dream a reality.  The end is up in the air for everybody."

My way is basically a simpler version, especially since using the website/service name in the password makes sure nobody simply reuses the same line/quote for every account. But you obviously understand that.

portugalthephilosoph,AnythingGoesNews,1391094325.0,"From [PAUL KRUGMAN](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/04/the-story-of-henry-fords-5-a-day-wages-its-not-what-you-think/) (You know, that super liberal economist):
&gt;But in any case there is a fundamental flaw in the argument: Surely the benefits of low turnover and high morale in your work force come not from paying a high wage, but from paying a high wage “compared with other companies” — and that is precisely what mandating an increase in the minimum wage for all companies cannot accomplish.

Ford had to pay a high wage because he was facing high turnover rates:
&gt;Ford’s turnover rate was very high. In 1913, Ford hired more than 52,000 men to keep a workforce of only 14,000. New workers required a costly break-in period, making matters worse for the company. Also, some men simply walked away from the line to quit and look for a job elsewhere. Then the line stopped and production of cars halted. The increased cost and delayed production kept Ford from selling his cars at the low price he wanted. Drastic measures were necessary if he was to keep up this production.

He had to pay $5/day to keep his best workers. But it wasn't just about paying them a higher wage--it was about paying them a higher wage *compared to his competitors*. Mandating an increase in the national minimum wage does not allow for that, as Krugman notes. 

And that's not to mention that Ford, in 1914, was only paying a [1% corporate tax](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/content/pdf/corporate_historical_bracket.pdf), his employees would have only faced a [1% income tax](http://www.givemeliberty.org/docs/TaxResearchCD/TaxActs/IncomeTax1913.pdf), Ford himself would have faced a [7% income tax rate](http://www.givemeliberty.org/docs/TaxResearchCD/TaxActs/IncomeTax1913.pdf), and he would not have had any payroll taxes such as SSI or FICA. 

Further, in 1913 Congress voted on the [Revenue Act of 1913](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue_Act_of_1913) that established the lowest tariff's since the Walker Tariff of 1857--opening Ford's global markets even further. 

Worker mobility was much higher. It was much easier to hire a man and immediately have him getting to work, instead of spending hours upon hours filling out paperwork for tax reasons. 

There were less safety standards, environmental regulations, financial regulations, and other efficiency robbing paperwork that drives up the overhead of current manufacturers.

Final point: These people were making CARS, not HAMBURGERS. The UAW has a current starting wage of $14 and some change. 

Can we just send Michael Moore back into his hole in Flint, MI and keep him there? Or will he not fit in the hole anymore?"

Wiltron,AskReddit,1391094495.0,"As a former bouncer, I know a lot of basic hand to hand combat maneuvers, that can disable most men and/or women, that don't involve kicks to the testicles. Look at my comment history if you need proof, I've said it a lot of times :)

Take the heel of your dominant foot, and jam it into the bridge of their foot as hard as possible. Where someone would normally tie their shoelaces into a bow is where you're aiming. This causes one of two things to happen. It stuns them as normally people don't guard that area of their body when attacking. It also disables their foot movement, meaning they can't chase after you.

You can also add in a trip and an elbow to the clavicle, in an attempt to break their collar bone (aka. Clavicle), disabling their arm, causing a shit ton of pain, and putting them on the ground unable to brace themselves for the fall. That will cause more damage, and hopefully they hit their head on the toilet on the way down.

Here's a step by step guide to disable someone in three moves that don't rely on body strength or opposing force (meaning a 120lbs girl vs a 300lbs meatsack of a man):

1. Do the foot move described above. A shot the balls is NOT recommended as it can enrage some men. Don't take the chance and get someone who's already pumped full of adrenalin, enraged!

2. As they're instinctively bending over due to the pain, take your dominant foot, the one you just jammed into their foot, and place it behind their feet near the achilles heel.

3. Take your dominant arm and elbow them just below and off to the side of their neck, aka, hit their collar bone. Find where your collar bone is on your body now so you know where to aim. Strike with all your force and weight into the elbow to cause as much damage as possible. Only 12lbs per square inch is required to break that bone, completely disabling the arm next to it. 12lbs per square inch is very little force and most 10 year olds can punch that hard.

The foot behind them trick and the strike of the elbow will cause them to trip and fall backwards, allowing you to get away.

Some more basic protection moves:

1. If they surprise you and try to choke you out with both hands in front of them, around your neck, pray. Seriously, put your hands in a praying position then jam them straight up. When your elbows are at the same height as theirs, spread your arms outwards. If you're quick, you can use your hand to chop their neck and cause some breathing difficulty, but be careful with this one as you can kill someone with a hard enough blow by collapsing their air way.

2. If they surprise you from behind, and get you into a choke hold, move your neck where your adams apple would be in line with the corner of their elbow. This will let you breath one or two gulps of air. Follow step 1 from the first list to break the move. Do not waste energy/effort with elbows to their sides as that most of the time wont work. Don't use your head either, you need that to be as clear as possible (meaning don't swing your head back and try to headbutt them... nobody wins with a headbutt).

3. If they hit you in some way and cause you to loose your balance, then elbows up to nipple height, to guard your neck face and head. Use your feet and legs to kick them in the knees. Try to bend their knees the wrong way. They may fall on top of you, and if they do, try to use a knee to hit their face. Roll to your side away from where they're falling, hopefully this is your dominant side. Get up and give them a kick to the ribs, or use your elbow to hit them in their kidneys. Aim for their lower back if you have some upper body strength to prevent them from running at their top speed."

flashmedallion,Games,1391094507.0,"No, I agree with you.  What I'm hanging out for is a TES-styled open world, but going in a Sci-fi direction to justify the entire population being robots.  Maybe you are the only human.  That way they can write dialogue to their hearts content, and use a speech synthesizer to voice it.  Procedurally generate the voices based on some set of numbers that each NPC has.

It won't even matter if it sounds funny or a little off or if it messes up some words, because it will still make sense in the narrative context.

Actually, my big idea for that game would be to have entirely systems based interactions across the whole ""world"".  Your ultimate goal is to solve enough problems and recitfy enough systems so that the world/society is able to function automatically in a stable, closed environment.  As you repair the clockwork, so to speak, economies and ""social"" problems slowly disappear and the robots have less need to talk to you.  Eventually, once you've sunk enough time into the system to ""solve"" it, the entire game begins to ignore you completely, since you've made your role as a player redundant.

A written quest line will guide through the world and how it all fits together, but side quests will essentially be procedurally generated by errors in the social/economic flow.  There's not enough of some product making its way to town A, which triggers the quest.  Turns out theres a deficiency of resource B, due to ""gatherer"" NPCs in town C being attacked by hostile ""monster"" mobs at location D."

Geohump,Christianity,1391094555.0,"you do realize, that one of the most recognizable attributes of conservative Christian churches is bigotry? Especially towards homosexuals?

If that isn't true of your church, that's great. And I hope it's true that your church does not practice bigotry toward homosexuals, but allow me to remain skeptical especially given that you consider homosexuality a sin.

Biblical scholars find it curious that only male homosexuality is considered a sin, but female homosexuality is never mentioned or condemned.

So apparently being a Christian lesbian is OK, but being a Christian male homosexual is a sin.

It's quite clear how ludicrous and illogical this is.

As it turns out there is some contention about the verses in Leviticus that condemn homosexuality and whether it's actually about male adult homosexuality and not actually about the Middle Eastern practice, (which still continues today),of pederasty where young boys are recruited to be ""dancers"" for adult males, who then also have sex with them.

In the Middle Eastern culture, these men are not considered to be homosexuals and indeed from my point of view they are simply child rapists.

Biblical scholars have contended at times that the verses in Leviticus that condemn homosexuality, have been mistranslated and are actually condemning this practice of pederasty that is common in the Middle East, and continues, en masse today.

here's a link to a PBS news video about it entitled the [""dancing boys of Afghanistan
""](http://www.iptv.org/video/detail.cfm/7760/

However, I was pretty open with him and before things got too weird, I said to him, ""Hey, BC pills make me kind of insane for awhile. We probably shouldn't hang out this week but if we do, it's just a fair warning."" We hung out, I was psycho, he was annoyed, he stopped contacting me as regularly. But when things leveled out in my system, I texted him, sincerely mentioned my previous antics and acknowledged my craziness, we had a good laugh about it. We're good now. 

Back off for a little bit, wait for yourself to calm down, and give it a week or two. Contact him if you're still interested and see where it goes. "

Secondly, regarding the difficulty with inserting the penis. She was a virgin and she was nervous.  Those things don't help the process.  You really need to go slow and make sure she's lubricated when trying to put it in.   My wife still has problems with this after years.

ebonlance,rpg,1391094704.0,"&gt;However, I disagree with you on one point. Your comment comes off like the only people who are worthy, or truly respectful, of RPG's are the ""neckbeards"" because ""they actually know what the fuck they are talking about"". This type of thinking will only go to strengthen the ""us vs them"" mentality. Sure, their are many people who fit into the group who don't know what the fuck they are talking about, but I think you may be surprised by how many of those people are sincere about their love of the hobby. Many of those people are just as intelligent, dedicated, and passionate as the next guy. I urge you not to put them off before getting to know them.

The people you just described are just future neckbeards. If you honestly have a passion for this kind of stuff, it's very difficult not to become one. I don't mean all the stereotypes of being socially-inept and not bathing, I mean the qualities that have always truly defined nerds: ""deep-diving into games systems, filling pages upon pages with well-researched and cross-referenced campaign notes, and getting into heated debates over topics that are seemingly inconsequential to the outside observer."" Lacking expertise is only temporary to people who enjoy this stuff, as I mentioned elsewhere you'll pick it up via osmosis whether you try to or not.

The people I'm specifically complaining about aren't those who lack expertise but those who lack the inclination for improvement and learning. People who have arrived at these hobbies, declared themselves nerds, and decided that the label they've self-applied is a substitute for expertise. The idea that merely playing MTG makes you a nerd (and therefore a credible source of knowing what is or isn't balanced instead of accepting you still don't know jack shit about competitive play), or that playing one character in one campaign over a couple of sessions gives you license to ape the rants of more experienced gamers about other game systems, despite not ever having actually played them. Newcomers who want to pretend to be alpha nerds without ever having actually earned any expertise are annoying as fuck, and I stand by my claim that I would rather have socially awkward people who know their shit than socially abusive neo-nerds who don't.

You were faced with an impossible game and you found a way to 'win' just enough to keep going. Well done. 

I am sorry because it will likely be a challenge for you to move forward, to move past it, to find your voice and your pole-vaulting again. I know therapy would be difficult for you, but remember that there's more than one way to skin a cat. Maybe a group-setting that involves listening and reflection would be a place to start. Maybe it'll just take baby steps of time and trust. But just in the way you had to evolve a brand new skin of silence and metal, it'll take time to evolve back into your voice again. And you get to decide what skills and qualities make you the strongest and the safest you can be. No one else gets to decide that for you ever again...that's the blessing of adulthood.

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1391094978.0,"1. The amount of time you wait to have sex has little or no bearing on whether or not things will progress to a serious relationship. What you have to offer *beyond sex* is what makes you viable as a long-term partner.

2. Most of what women consider to be ""clear signs of interest"" are actually just vague, non-committal gestures of plausible deniability that they seem to think will maneuver themselves into a position where they are the ones who don't have to risk rejection. For some absurd reason, they expect this approach to work. 

3. You have to take an active role in meeting your own needs. You are the only person on Earth who is capable of doing this, and no one else is under any obligation to do it for you. Recognize what those needs are, and make them known.

4. We understand you need to ""vent,"" but if you constantly complain while doing nothing to alleviate your own problems, we aren't going to respect you.

5. It's your responsibility to truly own your sexuality. That means your orgasm is also **your responsibility.** It's up to you to learn what turns you on, what gets you wetter than a Bangkok monsoon, and the exact procedure that gets you to O-town. It is also your responsibility to **make this known to your partner.** No one likes playing guessing games with women who can't be bothered to take an active role in their own sexuality.

6. Attraction for women is different than it is for men. 9 times out of 10, the things that make a men attractive to you cannot be applied vice-versa. 

7. Being nurturing, caring, warm, engaging, graceful, and feminine is a good thing, and having good domestic skills isn't a strike against you. The idea of being able to cook a good meal or keep a clean living space doesn't put you in a role of domestic subservience, it just makes you look like you have your shit together."

That's my attempt to give them some popularity.  Now that they're not just the best levelling content, I think they need something to distinguish them.  Making them engaging activities instead of yet another fight might help.

&gt; How would this work?

To be honest, I didn't have anything in mind, but after the discussion sprung up I would lean towards a subset of your class abilities.  That's an issue in itself though.  If we are going crazy I'd propose something similar to PVP moves, but for mounts.  Again, before I'd want this I'd want a really good incentive for using mounts and a similarly good incentive for *not* using mounts.  It would have to be a really situational thing otherwise it's just silly if everyone's doing it indiscriminately.

&gt;It would make several minions ""must have"" instead of fun things to collect.

This is an issue, but I would have hoped that if it's minor enough, and there was enough horizontal choice (which to be honest FFXIV isn't too hot with right now), then you would hopefully not end up with endless theorycrafting about BiS Minion.  But that will always happen, I suspect."

If you played a Vampire once, you have pretty much played all Vampires. Most of the new stuff only had 2 ""builds"" and unlike previous classes no supplements to pad out more powers and ""builds"" for options. They added a lot of new stuff but didn't follow through supporting it, which put off a lot of people. 

B) They only started publishing Essentials-styled stuff after they started releasing it, even though it wasn't labeled as such. Starting with Heroes of Shadow all of the content was basically 4.5 without ever labelling itself as such. If you wanted more options that were in line with original 4E stylings you were shit out of luck if it didn't exist in a book published up to that point. 

It's actually kind of interesting how it mirrored 3.0-&gt;3.5 in a lot of ways. Nothing from 4E was truly obsoleted like a lot of the 3.0 stuff, but 3.5 content pretty much looked the same as 3.0 content so the same style of play was there."

bombeater,AskRedditAfterDark,1391095211.0,"That's a really weird thing to say.

The whole point of BDSM is that it is an exercise in trust. It's not just that the bottom is trusting the top to physically care for them... that is the most trivial aspect. Fundamentally, BDSM is the act of trusting each other to not judge you for what you do during the act."

The idea is that it only really handles request/response handling and provides a basic view system. You need to roll your own permission model, database manager (hence SQLAlchemy), template renderer (although I think Flask has its own that you can use as well), etc.

mmp31,politics,1391095578.0,"&gt;Cherry picking, suppressing evidence, or the fallacy of incomplete evidence is the act of pointing to individual cases or data that seem to confirm a particular position, while ignoring a significant portion of related cases or data that may contradict that position.

&gt;show me that its true for other jobs. 

I could sit here all day bringing up examples and you could keep coming back saying that it's not good enough for you.  What signficant portion of related cases or data contradict my position?

&gt;also, how can you prove that the min wage increase is directly correlated to the upward pressure on wages? i (edit): never learned that economic theory in my econ classes. causation doesn't imply correlation.

What constitutes corrleation is subjective; it can't be proven.

&gt;right, this is true. what i'm saying is that pay cuts can't just happen with 0 inflation and a down year in the economy. labor unions will have nothing to do with pay cuts. a lot of workers won't accept pay cuts. the ultimate result will be job losses. i understand that stagnant wages paired with inflation is very similar to a pay cut with 0 inflation. but its about perception in this case.

So you're saying it's better to have lower unemployment and lower wages than it is to have higher unemployment and higher wages?  That sounds like a strong case against the minimum wage.  You're basically saying that the state is justified in deceiving workers into accepting a pay cut through inflation becuase they're too stupid to know what's good for them.  That sort of dishonesty is not the type of morality we should be promoting as a society.

And of course there will be job losses, that's what happens when the economy turns downward.  What you're forgetting is that higher prices cause economic expansion to slow down or even reverse, which causes jobs to be lost.  So the irony is that in your quest to control unemployment, you'd be causing higher unemployment.

&gt;moderate inflation is way better than deflation because its conducive to economic growth. as long as there is real growth, then rising prices will always signal good things (unless it has to do with decreased supply). remember that a lot of our economy is based on perception and the global economy is focused on very moderate inflation. check out this khan academy video about it. 

Monetary inflation causes growth at first but then the higher prices that come later slow growth or even reverse it.  Higher prices don't signal good things for consumers.  Your video demonstrates that by saying that it higher prices decreases demand.

&gt;you are missing my point. price levels are determined by supply and demand. lets forget supply for now, as we assume it can react to and match demand. increase in demand = economy doing well. inflation then is able to curb the affect on prices (instead of a 5% increase in price levels, we only see a 2% increase). a more steady growth allows for better planning. going from a 3% increase to a 1% decrease is much easier to absorb and plan for than a 6% increase to a 2% increase. basically, less volatility is better for the economy.

I have no idea what you are talking about.  Please re-explain.

&gt;agreed, but this isn't rigged for just corps. its also better for consumers to plan, as well as the govt, non-profits, etc.

It's rigged for the higher income groups at the expense of the lower income groups.  As we've already gone over, it decreases the income of the poor, and it's not possible to increase minimum wage fast enough to offset that effect.  It's not better for consumers to plan because it eats away their savings, so it causes them to spend when they otherwise wouldn't have.

&gt;depending on the economy, yes it does. imagine zero inflation, down year in the economy. this discourages investment/borrowing and encourages savings and vice versa. now imagine 2-3% inflation, down year. interest rates are now close to 0 or negative. people are still discouraged to invest/borrow, but to a much lesser degree. &gt;i'm just curious what happens in 0 inflation when there is a recession 

False.  Zero inflation itself doesn't encourage saving any more than it encourages spending, no matter what the economy is doing.  As you said, there are other factors that affect whether people are spending or saving, such as interest rates.

There is a reason that people are discouraged and it's because the economy is downturned.  Distorting market signals by changing the inflation rate and manipulating interest rates causes people to borrow/spend money when they otherwise wouldn't have.  That generates growth now, which wouldn't have happened otherwise, so it comes at the expense of future growth.  The market needs to naturally recover in order to have permanent prosperous growth, and you can't do that by distorting the signals that individuals need to make that happen.

&gt;politicians (mostly to the right) already believe there is rampant fraud in the welfare system (which there is barely any at all). how do you think they will feel when uncle sam writes poor people a $10k check that can be spent anywhere (and not specific like SNAP). i'm thinking realistically that this will be in a convo when automation really starts gaining traction.

I don't know, hopefully the neo-conservative ideology will be dead by the time that happens.

&gt;i really would need to see details on a negative income tax to know if i support it or not. whenever i imagine it in my mind, it usually ends up not working. but abolishing min wage at the same time might be interesting. would prices increase as a result or would the increase in income from the govt be offset by a decrease in wages?

Prices can only increase because the Fed initially expands MB. Inflation is not necessary for a NIT to be implemented because it would be financed by taxes on money that already exists.  The increase in income wouldn't be offset by a decrease in wages because the NIT would provide a living wage for those with no other income."

tehwookiee53,WritingPrompts,1391095681.0,"I was exhausted. I had been in the office all day, pulling teeth, performing root canals, and generally sticking my hands wrist deep in people’s gums. The last procedure was removing a pair of impacted wisdom teeth, which was difficult at the best of times. The sun twinkled at the horizon, seemingly as ready to sleep as I felt. I was the last person in the office, and the silence was soothing me to sleep as effectively as a lullaby. 


I was awoken suddenly by a knock at the front door. It was hours after closing, and the sign very clearly said “Closed”, so I ignored it and continued to finish cleaning my office. The knock rang out again, louder and more persistent, and a muffled voice spoke.  “I beg your pardon, Doctor, but I need to talk with you on a matter of some urgency.” There was no point in pretending: the man would continue to pester me until I let him in. 


I walked over and peered at the man through the peephole in the door. It was a tall individual, pale, with black hair trimmed neat and eyes so blue, they seemed to shine. He wore a suit that would have been the height of fashion seven or eight years ago, but now could only be called worn. There were patches on the elbows of the jacket, and the left knee showed evidence of a large tear repaired with small uneven stitches. The shoes were scuffed and dusty, and I caught a glance of two unmatched socks before he shifted. He was pulling a small wheeled suitcase of similar condition that seemed to rattle when it moved. 


He reached up to knock again, so I opened the door. “I’m sorry, sir, but we are closed. If this is an emergency, I can refer you to a 24 hour clinic, but you can’t stay here.” I moved to close the door, but the man reached his arm up before I could. “I beg your pardon, Doctor, but I’m here on official business. I am the Collector.” 


He said this with a certainty, as if I should recognize the name and welcome him in. When I didn’t immediately respond, he looked at me closely for the first time. “If I may ask, you haven’t been in possession of this dentistry for very long, have you?” I was taken aback, as my father had recently passed away, leaving me full ownership of the practice. On my stammered affirmative, he nodded. “That explains it. My contract was with the previous owner, and as such, you would have no knowledge of me. Please, let me introduce myself more completely.”


He bowed, an awkward motion that resembled a stork folding in half. “I am The Collector. This is both my name and my title, and I am known by no other. I am not well known, but you may know my coworker. She is known as …” He hesitated for a second before starting again. “She is known to you as the Tooth Fairy.” He continued quickly over my sudden interjection. “Please Doctor, I know how it sounds, but please let me finish. We both collect human teeth for medical uses. As you know, the dentin of a human tooth is harder than bone. Our people have a method of converting the teeth into bone splits and other life saving devices. If you look here, I have a copy of the contract…”


As the man paused to reach down, I exploded. “The Collector? The Tooth Fairy? You expect me to believe that?” He looked up from his suitcase, and now his eyes were truly glowing. “Do not judge me by this shell; I am more powerful than you can fathom.” He stood up straight, and for a moment, his presence seemed to fill the room, dark and menacing. 


But the feeling faded as soon as it came. He seemed to deflate slightly, and the looming shadow of power was just a man again. “Yet I am fading. Better oral hygiene and uncooperative dental practices have cut my collections down to a minimum, placing me in a bad position to start threatening people. Besides, threats are a poor way for doing business. Let us instead speak simply.” 


He again reached down to his case and retrieved a document, which he passed to me with great care. “This is a duplicate of the contract that I held with the previous owner. You will find that everything is in order according to the CDC and OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogen Standard.” I pulled out my reading glasses and examined it carefully, but all of the wording seemed to be in order. He took a step toward me, and steepled his hands as if praying “Let us ignore the supernatural for the moment, and look at this from a business standpoint. I am offering you a method of disposal for all of your office’s medical waste for no charge. Why would you care what happens after that?”


That convinced me more than any other argument. I pulled a pen from my pocket and moved to sign, when the man stopped me yet again. “One last thing you should be aware of. You are the only one that will be aware of my presence, once you sign that. No one else will be able to perceive me, or anything pertaining to me.” I tried to think about that for a second, then chalked it up to some magical bullshit and signed the contract. Besides, what’s the worst that could happen?

He explained what he was doing from a more Western perspective (no qi or energy imbalance and such). The chronic pain I'd had in my upper back since I was a little kid was toned down to the very occasional dull throb. Five or so months after I used up my ten free appointments, it started coming back slowly, and now (three years later), it's back to what it was originally. I'm considering going back at some point, since yet another round of physical therapy (recommended by my family doc) two years ago did very little."

macadore,AskReddit,1391095784.0,"In my opinion, much of the work that many doctors do is unnecessary and serve no purpose other than lining the doctor's pocket. For example, If I need a blood analysis, I have to go to a doctor's office where an assistant will draw my blood and send it to a company to do the analysis. Then I have to go back to the doctor to get a printout of the analysis and so the doctor will write a prescription for the drugs I need. 

Other than lining the doctor's pocket, there is no need for me to go to a doctor for that.  The printout tells me which blood properties are in the accepted range and which are out of the range. There's no reason the printout can't prescribe drugs to get the out of range properties back in range and tell me when to have the analysis done again. It should also be able to tell me when the drugs aren't having the desired effects and suggest I see a specialist about the problem. 

In short, I should be able to go directly to the company that analyzed blood and have the analysis done there. The company should send the analysis to me. I should be able to take the analysis to a drugstore and have the drugstore fill the prescriptions instead of having to pay for two unnecessary visits to a doctor's office.

However, I'm talking about the dude that has steady employment but is only making, I don't know, $30K a year. If you put just $1K down per year from 25 to 65 and you average 10% interest, you'll have a little over $532K. That only amounts to $27 per paycheck. That's the only thing I'm saying. You'll have many guys who say, well since I only make $30K a year I don't make enough money to save. Now if you make $30K a year and your employee matches like many do? Shit, take advantage of that.

Again, however, if you don't have a job, all of this talk is moot. And if your job doesn't offer 401(k), you'll have to open an IRA and save with after-tax dollars.

Edit: The beauty of 401(k) is that you're using pre-tax dollars, so if you save $1K, it's really only $700 if you decide not to.

But if that guy can't eat for cheaper than fast-food than he either is eating some premium shit at home, is still going out for most meals, is doing something very wrong, or possibly doesn't have access to the necessary things (maybe he lives above two great takeout places but doesn't have a kitchen, doesn't have a car, and no reasonably good grocery store is within walking distance).

As cheap as McDonald's is, you can always eat cheaper at home."

This lead to him desiring to exert his will over others (as that's what Rings are designed to do). This desire is inherently corrupting in the morality of Middle-Earth.

Then, he had access to a palantir, a large orb that allowed him to view remote areas of Middle-earth from the safety of his tower. However, Sauron also had a palantir, and the two were networked together, sort of. Sauron was able to force Saruman to view things askew, leading Saruman to despair of ever defeating Sauron (which was his original mission) by conventional means. Saruman figured out that if he could get his hands on the Ring of Power, he could overthrow Sauron and rule himself, which he saw as the best option -- in part because he felt that overthrowing Sauron was otherwise impossible, and in part because he really, really wanted to rule.

Saruman eventually attempted to create his own Ring of Power (he calls himself ""Saruman Ring-maker""). He then joins with Sauron, thinking that if he can't beat 'em, he might as well join 'em and rule at least a part of the post-War of the Ring world, which he expects Sauron to conquer."
jarwes,raisedbynarcissists,1391096240.0,"&gt; i hardly ever talk. Hardly ever as in, the amount of words i speak in a day creates around 1 standard sentence........but can't talk over the phone or actually speak and use my voice.

Yeah, I'm in the same boat as you even at age 55.  I have to get to know someone fairly well before I start talking in more than one or two word sentences.  And phone conversations.......not happening.  My wife, before we got married, used to ask me why I didn't talk long on the phone (or even call her), that was one of the first FLEAS I had to inform her about so she wouldn't think I was uninterested in her.  My current cell phone usage is around 10-20 minutes a month and I only talk to her or my stepson.

&gt; i worry i will see the ""you're stupid!"" look that Nmom gives me if i ever look into anyone eyes

Most people aren't like that!  That's one of the big hurdles you have to get over.  The next hurdle is this: Your nMom was WRONG about you in every way.  Make that your personal mantra.  My ndad was much like your nmom in that everything I did was wrong in his eyes, and I do mean EVERYTHING.  Even when I did something right I could have/should have done it better sooner.  Eventually I realized he was the stupid one and he was just projecting his feelings of inadequacy onto me.  

Obviously some professional help seems in order if you can afford it.  Talking to a therapist might help you get used to talking more.  Find something that really interests you and see if you can get with other people who share those same interests.  Eventually you'll find that you want to share your ideas and thoughts about your interest with them.  Also I might recommend picking one of your friends who you trust more than the others and try to explain your issue and ask her/him to help you work on your not speaking.  Ask her/him to prod you to answer beyond your normal 'nodding, shaking my head, shrugging my shoulders, writing things down, and pointing'.  It will be painful at first, embarrassing at times, and yes, once in a while you will say something stupid but normal people won't hold that against you if you do.

Wow, that was a lot of rambling, sorry about that.  Good luck and get some professional help if you can.

Simply having an opinion on something these days is enough to many people to think of you as an asshole these days.

It makes me wonder what the hell happened to this generation. When did apathy become a virtue?"

Terminator in the first movie was the overpowering villain in the first movie. In the second movie, he struggled against a more powerful and overwhelming foe, and it is in that movie that we see signs of humanity or at least points of sympathy with him. Even Mad Max, Superman, Batman, etc, in their more epic story arcs often start off from weaker positions or struggling from some kind of weakness.

Most movies do not even have a final boss fight involving some killing. The shared theme of the righteous underdog overcoming the odds however is common."

dontknowmeatall,AskReddit,1391096438.0,"A few days ago I scared my sister. She's 14 and I was walking her from school. Someone who knows us passed by and since she was talking and I was completely dressed in black (it was night) he asked her ""who are you talking with?"" I saw a chance and I took it.

First, I walked thirty seconds acting like she's not there. I suddenly took her arm and with the creepiest face I could make I said ""you have to wake up"". Then I kept walking like nothing happened. After five minutes of she insisting on me to talk to her, the fun part started. I asked:

""Who are you?""

""I'm your sister""

""I don't have a sister""

""yes you do, it's me!""

""No I don't. I had one, but she passed away ten years ago.""

Then after every sentence she said I'd answer with ""I had one but she passed away ten years ago"". Then I remembered a Doctor Who episode and started saying ""I had one, but she passed-she passed- she passed- passed-pa---pass--pa--"" and when she was all freaked out and yelling I couldn't hold it and started laughing like crazy. It didn't last long, but for a moment she believed me.

First off, all of the participants were already suffering from paranoia before they were run in the study, and the participants were not selected for by height.

Second, the manipulation was to walk through a virtual environment with your perspective manipulated so that one time you are walking through it 10"" (25cm) shorter than the other.  So the study wasn't about ""short people"", it was about ""suddenly losing 10 inches.""

10"" is a big difference.  For a short woman, that would make them child-sized.  For a very tall man, that would make them as tall as your average woman, and shorter than most men.  I'd think this effect of a loss of 10"" might be strongest for tall men who are used to towering over everyone.

So in short, (heh) this study says nothing about short people being paranoid- only that suddenly losing height can worsen paranoia in people who already have it."

&gt;I'm not in a position to prescribe exactly which methods to use...it's not like we are FORCED to use resumes and ATS every single time or bust.

Yes, there are other ways to do this, but you admittedly don't know what would work best them. Yet you condemn their choice. You may be right, they may be using a really crappy system for their needs. It's a distinct possibility....but you don't know that it is true.

&gt;Applicant ""shotgunning"" is the result of this system.

I don't think this is true. If you have data to back up the claim, I'd like to see it. 

Anecdotally, I know people shotgunned applications before ATS existed. People did this when I got out of college in the early 90s. When I started that job, we got lots of irrelevant applications when new positions opened. It was even more frustrating then, because it was so hard to get people, it was a job seeker's market. Which makes the practice even more confusing....applicants could pick and choose, shop around...but many didn't.

ATS's may have existed then, but they were certainly not widespread. We didn't use them. Most job applications at that time were done via the postal service or in person. And people shotgunned like crazy; people would get rolls of stamps, hit the copy shop, xerox resumes and cover letters, and spam them out. Many of these were cold calls, but many were also people applying for specific positions. 

Yes, the use of ATS is overdone and stupidly used as a ""one size fits all"" solution. There are better systems, there are more industry-specific solutions. Things need to adapt to the new job market. I agree with all of this. 

However, job seekers must carry some of the blame as well. There are many job applicants that submit applications like this, spamming them out. This increases the reliance on ATS, which increases the prevalence of shotgunning; and round and round we go. It is most certainly not all the fault of the job seeker, but it is equally not all the fault of the hiring side. Both the shotgunning applicants and the ATS cookie cutter HR departments are to blame.

Utilities from stove? A stove-top element uses like 2kW on high. I know utility prices vary, but even at an obscene price like 80 cents per kWh, it still only costs about 20 cents to boil eggs. And given that 8 cents is a more normal price, we're looking at about 2 cents.

Oil and seasoning are a) dirt cheap and b) not necessary. And if you're worried about owning cookware, then there's a good chance that you don't even own a functional kitchen, which is a much bigger problem.

Lilcheeks,AskReddit,1391096993.0,"My situation is somewhat unique compared to the average smoker so this probably wont help most people, but I used chantix and was also already going to NA meetings. 

The chantix was really helpful for me because it made me want to stop. By about 2 weeks in I was down to 1 a day and that was more out of habit. I was smoking and not enjoying it. I had the mental conversation ""this kinda sucks and is pointless, I'm doing this out of reflex more than anything"". So at that point I gave away the rest of my cigs and stopped completely. I stayed on the chantix for another month maybe, even though they say to stay on it for 6.

I think the reason why this was feasible for me was the other thing I mentioned, NA meetings. Staying on chantix for 6 months matters because it gets you accustomed to not smoking for an extended period of time, however I was able to use the tools I'd gained from staying away from other drugs and apply that to cigarettes. IE- Don't pick up the first one and you wont have the ones that follow. It's a simple concept, but for people who have been addicted to something, they know how it works. You have one, it turns out to be enjoyable and you think, okay I can do this once in awhile. It's more fun this way, once in awhile. Once in awhile turns into weekends, turns into once a day, turns into when you're stressed, turns into breaks, turns into all the time. 

The point is, once you've broken the physical part, and you've gained some time away from it completely, it becomes a choice rather than a compulsion. You learn to cope without. You stop hanging out with smokers when they're smoking(until eventually it doesn't really affect you, other than the part where you now find them disgusting to be around).

Rinnve,russian,1391097222.0,"Learning a language and learning rules of a language are two very different things.

As for your question... What they wanted to say is

a) you must add specific endings to some Russian words that depend on circumstances to ""connect"" words in a sentence, and

b) some words in their basic form end on soft consonant, some on hard, and

c) when you add an ending that starts with a vowel, you change the type of that vowel according to (b).

For example, let's take two words: ""компьютер"" (computer) and ""пользователь"" (user). Take a sentence, say ""This problem is on computer's side"" / ""..... user's side"". It translates roughly one-on-one: ""Эта проблема на стороне компьютера"" / "".... на стороне пользователя"". I added ending to ""компьютер"" to connect this word to others. I then added essentially the same ending to ""пользователь"", but because ""пользователь"" end with soft consonant, vowel in the ending becomes soft too.

There is one problem though. This AlphaDictionary page oversimplifies things so much that I don't think that you (or anybody) can learn something useful from it."

the_clever_cuban,fantasybaseball,1391097265.0,"Don't even consider Schoop, average at best bat and will hit at the bottom of the lineup plus you already have profar at 2nd. Your OF is full prospect wise with Hamilton Puig and Taveras, you're covered at 2nd with profar, short with Bogaerts and then have 3 pitchers.

For the final 2 keepers I would cut it down to a smaller list to pick from The guys you should be considering are Arenado, Castellanos Rendon and then Skaags. I personally love Arenado. I think he has the ability to hit 15-20 HRs this year while hitting for a high average. Colorado's bats are going to be really good this year and I could see him hitting in the 2 hole. Then I would say pick between Rendon and Castellanos you can't really lose there but Rendon has a higher injury risk."

its just doesn't make any sense at all. people are not en mass involved in police chases. and when they occur they are usually stopped and apprehended with minimal damage/cost.

It makes far more sense in people being able to stop and track their own vehicle for the perposes of crime prevention.

lapoutine,VictoriaBC,1391097311.0,My parents live on Forrester just off of Richmond. They assisted on the scene. The article is 100% accurate. My father spoke to a teacher at Lansdowne and according to him/her the girl luckily only suffered a broken nose and possibly a concussion.

TheDoctorWho,DeadBedrooms,1391097313.0,"That's...actually not a terrible excuse. My wife had some really serious fears of getting pregnant when we first started dating, and would sometimes have issues with that kind of thing. While it's a super outlandish scenario, you'd never want to end up in the situation with a broken condom and then find out it WAS that thing. And I'd say ""well, one broken condom doesn't mean you're going to get pregnant"" but we got pregnant on the very first try so I know sometimes it could happen.

Well, you've still got another day or whatever, and the only requirement is you stop using it for 2 days, so I'd just not use it and remind her you're following what she asked.

In the mean time, I can say this: there are condoms and lubes out there that contain menthol. HOWEVER, there are also some studies out there showing a possible connection to talc dusted condoms (non-lubricated) and certain kinds of cancer in women, so if she looks into it she could find that. Now...I assume you're not coating your cock in a pile of gold bond, nor are you putting it on the outside of the condom. Further, if the condom is over your balls where the gold bond is going, you're doin' it wrong :P

So in the end, there's a teeny tiny reason for her to actually have valid concern about talc in that general area, so instead of insisting it's okay, I'd instead focus on keeping her to uphold what she said. "

Eponia,AskReddit,1391097318.0,"It would provide a lot of protection for the women who do it. Healthcare, rights on labor and payment, if they've been raped then they would be way more willing to report it (because yes people, you can rape a prostitute), they'd be registered so it would be a lot harder for psychos to target them as victims that no one would ever miss. I mean seriously, who are they hurting? Nobody but a bunch of prudes' sense of decorum. I know some women who claim that NO woman EVER would ever voluntarily, under no coercion and of her own will, be a prostitute by choice. So to them legalizing prostitution means legalizing human trafficking. Well those women are wrong. Just because THEY wouldn't doesn't mean no woman would. I think if we legalized and regulated it, it would be a lot harder for young girls to end up getting forced into it. Just like legalizing pot is going to hurt drug dealers, and remove a lot of the dangerous element from it since now it'll be more readily available, legalizing prostitution will only make it harder for pimps. Why risk having sex with a woman/girl who isn't registered or clean and has possibly been forced into this when they can go have sex with a legal, clean, willing prostitute? I'm sure there'd still be some, but it'd be less common I think."

The same with women. Even their protags have some kind of weakness that makes them the underdog relative to others. It doesn't have to be power, but perhaps their beauty, sociality, etc. 

It's just a narrative bias, because if the protags starts off flawless or even just superior there is less struggle for the story.

Wiltron,AskReddit,1391097441.0,"12 years of bouncing at various bars all over Ontario, and most of the time I'd help the bus boys clean up after everyone was booted out of the bars.

At one bar, which was known in town to be less than clean, there were so many used tampons and used condoms on the dance floor that we had to get those blue biological waste bags by order of the town after the garbage men started to complain. We had to clean up the other shit, leaving behind ""biological items"" and clean them up in separate bags.

Also, at various other bars, I found a full 12"" pink vibrator with those beads that spin around in it, a few vibrating cock rings, cell phones.. cell phones galore. I never had to buy the latest iPhone back when I was a broke student working sucker, because I'd just wait a week after release and bam, week old iPhone that either no one claimed or was ""thrown out as the it was all broken from being stepped on"".. Wallets packed with cash, which were returned sans cash. Wedding rings, also returned because I'm not a complete dickhead.

Most cash I ever found in one night was a yellow envelope with $3200 in it, all $20's, sitting next to one of those novelty Pulp Fiction wallets with $900 in it. It was sitting on the table at the back of the bar where ""VIP's"" normally sit. I kept both, returned the IDs and CC's and other cards, said the wallet was thrown out as it was covered in shit.. literally..  because it was found in the bathroom. He said thanks for returning it, but didn't mention the cash that was missing.

Also found a solid troy oz silver bar, but I know that that shit is registered and trackable so I kept it in the cash register waiting to be returned. No one claimed it and I brought it to the cops who said if no one claims it in 90 days, I'll get a call and I can have it legally. Mysteriously it was claimed ""a few days before the 90th"".

EDIT: A troy oz silver bar is small.. a few inches at the most.. I'd guess it was a quarter inch thick by maybe 4 inches long and an inch wide? This was 7 years ago, and I only held it for a few minutes. It is NOT like the gold bar Zeus was carrying in Die Hard 3 (that was about a foot long by 5 inches high and 3 inches wide.. and weighs a lot more than you'd expect)"

tendorphin,needadvice,1391097563.0,"Well, now you're getting into a different argument. What is appropriate to say or do at work. This is an ethical Greg area because morals are not universal. If the company has no policy against topics of discussion, there's no *real* reason to stop any sort of speech at work. Having said that, what he's done is a good case for animal abuse. However, there could be an argument on his end that anyone who buys from the meat industry is condoning animal abuse unless they do tireless research into which companies don't abuse the hell out of their animals (spoiler alert; most companies abuse the hell out of their animals), so what he did was ""tame"" compared to much of the federally approved methods of running a business. 

And again I say that treatment of animals is vastly cultural, and may or may not be seen as wrong depending on who you ask. The problem is, there's no ""correct"" answer. Obviously there is a more empathetic answer, but ""right and wrong"" are very subjective. As well, what is ""perverse"" is also based on societal norms.

Don't take this wrongly, because I *absolutely agree with you.* I just don't think he is necessarily sick, nor is speaking of such things at work actionable. If you notice a pattern of behavior, let someone know, but I'd say only your immediate supervisor. There is a possibility that he was just fucking around. I don't think rats can go weeks without food. I have pet rats and when I first had them i didn't quite know the right way to feed them yet (but i thought i did) and one almost starved after a few days of just not eating enough, let alone not eating anything. 

Anyway, to sum up, he isn't necessarily punishable, but if you notice this kind of thing coming up frequently then it is something you may want to bring up to a supervisor with discretion. "

EOverM,worldbuilding,1391097677.0,"Biogenesis.  It's believed that the natural order of things is for all races to be specialised (warriors, scientists, artists, linguists, etc.), and that humanity is a bizarre exception.  It is also believed that life formed independently and naturally, just happening to end up with vaguely similar forms and being on similar planets because that's the way things are - life forms on certain types of planets within a certain range, and successful sentient life will share certain traits, such as at least one pair of limbs that aren't required for walking with nimble manipulators at the end for tool use.

What actually happened is that an ancient precursor race (that only very few in galactic civilisation are aware of) left their homeworld and discovered that as far as they could tell, they were alone in the universe.  As such, they started a grand experiment and seeded life throughout the galaxy, but manipulated its genetics to cause any sentient life that evolved to have limitations - specialisations.  Humanity (or rather its single-celled ancestors) was the final race to be seeded, but before the precursors could implement the limitations to our genetics, an unknown cataclysm struck and all but wiped them from existence.  Isolated artifacts remain, but the race itself is gone - and it appears to have been practically instantaneous.  No signs of a war, or societal unrest - the records found simply stop, and are then only updated by automatic systems.

This isn't public knowledge because a shadowy society suppresses the evidence (which, in a vast galaxy, is rather easier to do than it would be on Earth) and deals with anyone who finds out of their own accord.  They claim it's because the revelation would destroy civilisation, but it's largely because of the vast profit they gain from reverse-engineering the unbelievably advanced technology of the precursors.  One of the scientific races are effectively sufficiently-advanced aliens (even to the humanity of the 2600s), and the precursors seem like that to them.  There are artifacts that no-one has even worked out what they're supposed to *do*, let alone how they work."

February 11, 2033: First machine tested successfully after over one hundred failed tests. Controversy over the destructive nature of the technology ignites.

July 18, 2033: A catastrophic incident with an energy-matter transfer machine destroys Hiroshima, a devastation not seen since the Atomic Bomb dropped nearly 90 years before. Japanese officials move to ban the technology, Western powers urge them allow it, despite the mishap

April 22, 2035: First sighting of infected individuals. Most are animals, some Humans are susceptible to infection. Most seen around the ruins of Hiroshima, which has not been rebuilt.

May 13, 2035: Northern Japan is split off from its Southern half, as a nation wide quarantine is in enacted. Anarchy soon spreads through the infected regions. 15% of the humans are immune to the disease and show no side effect. 84.9% are affected fatally by the disease, which causes cancerous growths. 1% of those exposed are shown to successfully mutate. The “Virus” is found to be a spreadable corruption of genetic material, which causes rapid mutation in infected individuals. All large animal life above ground soon become mutated.

January 1, 2040: 98% of all animals in Japan are wiped out; ecosystems rules entirely by infected individuals.

May 8, 2048: Japanese Defense Force engages infected individuals to preserve quarantine. Coordinated attacks by infected humans and animals are seen. High levels of intelligence confirmed.

May 10, 2048: They fail, the nation of Japan ceases to exist.

October 13, 2048: The United States Carrier George W. Bush is attacked and sunk by an unknown force. Later revealed to be a coordinated attack by the infected. Use of Atomic weapons to destroy all life on Japan considered, but denied.

February 12, 2052: Remaining inhabitants of Japan have appeared, by outward observers, to have begin adopting the infected ones into their religions. Part of this religion is a total weapons ban, and the banning of violence against infected individuals. This is surprisingly effective at ceasing conflict with the infected individuals.

April 2, 2055: Infected have seem to spread to North America. Military preparedness results in far more contained infection. Hundreds of thousands in North America, Canada, and Mexico die.

March 11, 2061: The United States Army begins experimenting with the combat prowess of the infected animals, who are shown to have a friendly connection to humans who treat them well, much like dogs. Initial tests exceed expectations. Later that year, China, North Korea, Russia, and Vietnam sign the Kommu Pact, ensuring protection against the now overpowered west.

July 2, 2063: The Kommu alliance declares war on the United States. Infected used to great effect.

November 9, 2066: The war ends. Communist states are dissolved, all of Asia is now under the control of NATO.

December 25, 2072: The now divided regions that were once Japan begin to open up to the outside world. Mostly through scientific trade off.

February 1, 2081: Japanese scientists sneak into heavily infected Brazil. They recover the DNA of what they believe is to be one of the first infected. Beliefs are that the infected are actually the next phase in evolution, and to find one of the originals would help better the understanding. There are many tried-and-failed cloning attempts, before the final experiment is successful. The result of this experiment, capable of self-induced Energy-Matter transference, is responsible for for the deaths of before escaping.

SenseiCAY,AskMen,1391097878.0,"It seems like the thread is very much leaning in one direction, but I have a different view (despite the fact that I didn't follow this myself).

I moved out of town right after I got a job (stayed with my parents for maybe 6 months after I graduated) so I had to get an apartment. My rent (with a roommate) got as high as $1250 per month, plus utilities and parking, and that was taking up about 45% of my monthly take-home pay.

I think that as long as you have plans to move out, it's fine to live with your parents for awhile to save money. I probably would have done it if I had stayed in town for my job. There are down-sides, but I think that in the long run, the monetary benefits outweigh them. There's a lack of space and independence, but if you're on good terms with your parents, then it may or may not be a big deal to you. It's harder to bring girls over, but if you're already in a relationship or you can manage to avoid your place for awhile, it might not be a problem. Had I stayed for a year, I would have saved about $15,000, similar to you, OP. I would have been able to buy myself a pretty good car outright, instead of taking out a loan. Heck, I could have used it for a down payment on a house or something. I dunno. At any rate, it's not inherently a bad idea to stay with the parents, but just make sure you have a plan to get out of there, preferably in the near future. "

Really, I don't have cough, the smell doesn't concern me, I never smoke in my car and forbid anyone even think to light up a cigarette inside. I don't smoke inside my home and the stigma is low.

I even stopped cold turkey smoking for a week because I wanted to gain some breath for a physical activity I was going to do in Norway last month. One week without smoking because I decided so, no cravings. And when I was done, I restarted smoking as usual. 10-15 cigarettes per day.

noc007,AskReddit,1391097965.0,"Agreed. After I graduated HS, I was not interested in going to another class for a long time. I paid out of pocket for a semester at a community college and hated it. I don't learn well with the normal method of teaching and decided to put it on hold. I decided to educate myself differently and hopped into the workforce. Now I make more money than my peers with no college debt.

Before I got married, my future MIL did not like the fact I wasn't college educated. This was a major mark against me in her family where her siblings are all college educated along with most of her nieces and nephews. I eventually won them over. The fact that I can support my family on a single income and live comfortably is a big part of it.

Sadly my college educated friends don't all pull the same kind of income. One with a Bachelors still works at Walmart. Another friend with a Bachelors works two jobs with his wife working one. Another friend with a Bachelors just can't break out of the retail job they've been in since college. Some other friends have fared better, but my lack of college paper has given me a 4-6 year start ahead of them.

Any company that values a stupid piece of paper more than actual skill, experience, and work ethic is a company I don't want to work for. I don't understand the value in wasting 4 years on a piece of paper that has nothing to do with their career. I do agree that there is value in higher education of college for jobs like architecture or medical doctor, but getting a degree for something that one isn't going to do is foolish to me."

Second, both definite and indefinite articles would be grammatically valid here, but they would evoke slightly different emotions. Using an indefinite article (""a drafting table..."") sounds very vague, and the drafting table and construction site aren't as firmly linked in the mind of the reader.

By switching to a definite article, it sort of solidifies the table and construction site, and links them together, since now there's only (metaphorically) a single drafting table and a single construction site, although they represent all drafting tables and construction sites.

Hopefully that helped a little, it may have just made it more confusion. :)

Edit: just watched and it was a huge let down. Firstly, I don't think anyone is suggesting a high-sugar diet or a high-fat diet would be a good thing, usually it's low fat vs low carb. You could argue that low fat is high sugar but it's not really.

The high sugar guy lost half the weight he lost in muscle, and the high fat guy lost two thirds of the weight he lost in muscle.

They skirted around saying that clearly both of them ate fewer calories, and their weight loss was a result of consuming fewer calories. They consumed fewer calories because, apparently food that are high in fat and sugar doesn't make you feel full

It was clear that neither a high sugar or high fat diet worked, but they didn't test anything that did. I would have liked them to try a high protein diet. My opinion remains that a high protein diet is best, as long as you limit your calories."

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391098189.0,"So, the Rings were creations of the Elves, with Sauron's help (Sauron was disguised as Annatar, Lord of Gifts, at the time and not recognized as evil). The idea was to use them to stop what the Elves saw as the decay and fall of the World through time. We see this in action in Rivendell and Lothlorien, which are both places sustained by the Elven Rings (Gandalf had the third Elven Ring). In Lorien especially, time is weird, and nobody can remember how long they've been there once they leave. This is because of the Ring's preservative effect.

However, Sauron's ""help"" was two-edged, and included a sort of ""back door."" He opened this back door by crafting the One Ring, which had power over all the other Rings and the ability to control their wearers. The exception was the Three Rings of the Elves, which were crafted without his help, but using his knowledge. Sauron's plan was to control the most powerful leaders of Elves, Dwarves, and Men with the One Ring, and conquer the world that way. This backfired because of the Three Rings of the Elves, which Sauron could not control. He *could* use the One Ring to read the minds of their wearers, but the downside for him was that the Three could also see what Sauron was doing with the One. So his whole plan got thrown off because he couldn't control the Elves, and they went on to fight a very long war instead. But that's a different story; suffice it to say that Sauron eventually loses, and at the end, has the One Ring cut off.

The thing is, the One Ring required a lot of power to pull that ""back door"" off. Basically, Sauron had to put a huge amount of his soul into the Ring to have that much power over the other Rings. He put so much in that, if the One Ring were destroyed, most of his soul would go with it, leaving him powerless, a formless spirit that can only hate, but not do anything about it.

However, because he also put a little bit of his power into all the other Rings, destroying the One would destroy their power, as well. So after Gollum falls into the Cracks of Doom, the Ringwraiths are destroyed, and the Three Rings of the Elves lose their power."

BalooDP,AskReddit,1391098446.0,"Different music business, you have to remember this:

Buying music then was like buying a video game now. You went to the store, pick up the record, look at it, MAYBE get a recommendation from the clerk, and decide to buy it or not. There is NO internet, there's no independent artists, you have to go through the radio AND a record label to get ANYONE to listen to your music. If you aren't signed to a label, your records aren't in stores, people don't buy them and listen to them. Singles were frequently sold by themselves.

That's why things like iconic album art (ELO's logo, Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon, etc.) were so important. It was a recognizable branding, a logo of a quality product. Music wasn't totally driven by just sound then. The overall ""Best"" music didn't necessarily hit the top of the charts, it was what was advertised best and supported by the record labels and disc jockeys.

So really, if you didn't have a new product out on the shelf often enough, how could people remember you still existed? After all, aside from the radio there's no internet for you to just re-discover some long lost artist and dive into their old album and have it turn big like some artists have done in the past when they get a hit today. If you put out an album, and the stores stocked it, and then sold them all, they weren't going to keep restocking them unless it was some gigantor seller like Thriller. So to make more money, you put out another album. Because people would eventually come back to the record store and start looking for another record to buy after they listened to the first one they bought enough. And if they enjoyed the first Beatles album, surely they'd go and buy another one soon afterwards. Like when you're done playing a new video game and you want to go buy another one, standard of quality."

You have every right to feel what you feel, and when you're upset like you were, I wish she could have found some understanding and compassion. *You* are more important than a low gas gauge. Big hugs (if you'd like them) from me.

Second - Sometimes, if you find yourself crying and crying, it's possibly because some part of you is triggered - by the event itself, sure, but that might also reactivate other times you were hurt. In this case, being in a similar location to when you were bullied so much might have had you feeling vulnerable. And, too, yoga can sometimes bring up our ""stuff"".

It can help, in those times, to first of all, cry as much as you need, then breathe deeply a few times, and center yourself where you are. The way I do that is take a few minutes to feel where my body is: ""I feel the back of my legs on my bed. My hips, bottom, and back"", etc. for every limb and section of my body, relaxing each as I go, really sinking into wherever I am. (for me, especially relaxing my shoulders and face muscles helps) I close my eyes, and listen to whatever ambient sounds there are: my son's videogame in the background, the birds outside, a car going by, the hum of the heater, the dog snoring. Just notice without judging. I talk myself into where I am: ""Right now, I am safe. Right now, I am wearing clothing I like, I am warm. I am breathing, and alive. There is no immediate threat right now, I am safe."" The point isn't to stop feeling what you're feeling, it's to get centered in the here and now, so you can better deal with those feelings, rather than being swept away by them.

Wishing you much peace - and some kickass vibes, so you can stand strong in how awesome you are, no matter what a random twit might say!"

Never being in melee means not having to worry about mitigating or healing damage, which is why people solo with necromancer, elementalist, and chloroharb. After 50, you can't really kill things as fast and so you start having to drink a lot as a pyro, so I'd swap to necromentalist after 50 or chloroharb if you have it.

MN_Wild_Rice,StonerEngineering,1391098592.0,"First things first, go buy some JB-Weld or QuikSteel. If you smoke a lot of glass pipes, and you have broken any before, this is an essential must. I used to run a hobbyist pipe-repair gig out of my house in my earlier years, and I went through cold-weld epoxy products like a whore through birth control.

It is possible to repair this, although it is not, as I would imagine, going to be a 100% fix-it job. Just please be aware of this, even if you do an amazing patch job and manage to seal up it all up, the issue here is that you have definitive cracks running around your break zone. These can be patched over, and will look ugly when done; they will hold up for a time, but cracks like that like to spread.

With a cold-steel epoxy (which is, in my opinion, the ONLY glass-glass adhesive you should be using in repairs), you'll want to get a good layer on the edges of that gap, and *gently* weld the missing chunk back into place. With cold-steel epoxy's, make sure you are holding the weld together firmly, but gently, for at least 3 minutes, although with a gap like this, I would recommend up to 5. The gently part in my 'gently but firmly' should really be observed here, those cracks look ready to bust out :/ 

That's the relatively easy part. Now the tricky part- with cracks like those, I really recommend you take a razor, steel your nerves, and try to gently get a bit of the epoxy inside the cracks. You might want to do this part before welding in your missing chunk, up to you really. ~~You can try to start at the gap and worm your tip up through the crack, otherwise,~~ slap a layer on top of the cracks, then go back with said razor and try to GENTLY push some epoxy into the seams.  You definitely need to try and get some on the inside of those cracks though, or you could be looking at further stress breaks down the road, including some that could be pipe-fatal. Slapping some on the outside like duct tape will hold a good seal, but not provide the type of stability you need in a water pipe that you will get by getting inside the crack.


The other, drastic option, and I mean ***REALLY*** drastic, is to use a small rubber mallet and try to gently bring those fractures to full breaks, breaking out the additional chunks for easier welding. I've only had to do this once or twice before with a break like this, and while inducing additional breakage is good for getting a complete repair job, I had it fail on me utterly once, and once was enough for hundred dollar glass. Not worth it if you've never done repairs like this before.

Good luck OP, and as with all my pipe repair advice, PM for extra help.

Though, if you have enough leech, I fear that even that won't stop the belt from being a direct upgrade.

I also think that if blacks were given the opportunity so long ago to enslave white people they would have I feel like it was just a natural  order. 

I went to a small private school 1 or 4 black kids 2 of which were twins. I didn't really read of learn about slavery but we did however had a whole week where we talked about and watch Holocaust  movies. I noticed that if was talked about in a standpoint where you're suppose to feel sorry for these people. And from watching my cousins go through public school I feel like that's how they teach it and I don't think that's how it should be taught.

Ricekrisper,CFL,1391098965.0,"If it's blocked:

&gt;The Ticats have signed quarterback Zach Collaros. An official announcement expected shortly.

&gt;Collaros, 25, was solid last season, posting a 5-2 record as the starter while incumbent Ricky Ray was injured. The second-year player was especially sharp in a 38-21 win over B.C. on July 30, finishing 21-of-25 passing for 253 yards and three TDs. On Sept. 21, he completed 25-of-36 attempts for 330 yards and four touchdowns in a 33-27 victory over Calgary.

&gt;The six-foot-two, 216-pound Collaros finished the season completing 190-of-287 passes (66.2 per cent) for 2,316 yards with 14 TDs and six interceptions. He also ran 59 times for 246 yards and five touchdowns.

&gt;The signing of Collaros undoubtedly means the end of Henry Burris' two-year run as the starter in Hamilton. Sources said he will be released and will likely be signed by Winnipeg, who also made a strong push for Collaros.

rocky8u,TumblrInAction,1391099024.0,"The thing I find interesting is, the women who make the most progress in women's rights and the equal treatment of women are usually not those who go to school and study Women and Gender Studies. The women who make the most difference are those who earn respect in their chosen career and use that as a tool to inspire other women and girls to overcome the obstacles that often still face women in society.

The board of my local Women's Center is not made up of all the Women's Studies professors at the local university, it is made up of local businesswomen, engineers, and entrepreneurs.

I think Women's Studies degrees came about for women who were going to school, at least partially, to meet a husband. Some women used to do that, and degrees existed that catered to such women. However, now that our culture has changed, and women who go to college are expected to do so for career purposes. Women and Gender Studies is meant for two things, academia, and personal interest. It is not a career degree, and should not be treated as such.

I have much more respect for women who go to school, pursue practical degrees like marketing, engineering, accounting, economics, medicine, etc. Such women likely have some idea of what they want to do for their career. They have a plan. A Women's Studies degree seems hard to plan around, it suggests to me that students taking such degrees either don't have a plan, or have an unrealistic one. That, and nobody is there helping them understand that they have a whole life ahead of them, and they'd best be putting a plan of how to live it together RIGHT NOW."

sockalicious,explainlikeimfive,1391099095.0,"So alcohol is actually a preservative.  Whiskey is nice to drink, but it's also a way to store extra grain without spoilage.  There's about 75 lbs of grain in a standard 53 gallon barrel of bourbon; rats won't drink whiskey, and it won't rot or be invaded by fungus either.

Alcohol causes certain flavors to come out of oak barrels and go into the booze.  Some barrels are charred or toasted, leading to toasty flavors; the oak itself has tannins and vanilla-tasting compounds and they can take years to leach into the spirit or wine inside the barrel.  This is why you never see aged vodka or aged gin; the so-called 'white spirits' are not kept in barrels and so they are not thought to profit from the years.  

Another thing that happens is evaporation; the 'angel's share' of bourbon flies away into the air over the years.  Another thing that happens to booze that sits around is oxidation, a chemical reaction, which destroys some flavor compounds and modifies others.

Sitting a barrel around for 2 or 10 or 17 or 35 or 300 years requires real estate and the maintenance of some kind of business operation.  That takes money!  However, rarity is also an issue.  A lot of people like to have something that's rare and will pay extra money just to get it and show it off.

bknixon,Guitar,1391099214.0,"The guitar is commonly classified as a folk instrument, meaning that it doesn't require formal training to become relatively proficient. I would venture to say that the majority of famous guitarists (aside from classical) are or were not formerly trained. They developed their own guitar voice by learning from others, experimenting, and spending thousands of hours practicing. I am a formally trained musician, having played in school bands and many years of piano lessons, but I learned the guitar by hanging around guitar players that were better than me. But that was long before the web. To answer your question - - yes I think anyone should learn to play the guitar. Take lessons if you want, but it's not necessary. The best thing you can do is find a guitar buddy who's just a little better than you, and learn everything you can from him. Web lessons and such can definitely help with some technical aspects, but there's no substitute for just jamming with a friend, or strumming three chords while your sister sings along in the living room. I say this because I think a lot of aspiring guitarists forget the true nature of the instrument, and focus too much on learning arpeggios and scales that nobody really wants to hear. Strum on."

jhalton3,ModernMagic,1391099249.0,"Don't know about deck help, as I just started playing burn again myself.

Anyway, GP questions I can help with:

1)  You should use paper.  It also allows you to take notes, which is important if you have to play around anything.

2) The way I understand it, so long as the cards look the same, you are fine.  That said, I would recommend picking up tougher sleaves than Ultra Pros for a GP because they will wear out.

3)  You have to properly randomize their deck.  If you feel uncomfortable with your opponent shuffling your cards, you are allowed to call a judge and have the judge do it for you, I believe.  Tougher sleeves and double sleeving will help you feel more comfortable with your deck in your opponent's hands though.

4)  I do not know the answer to this one for sure.  I have always asked my opponent if it is ok to roll dice.  I think that so long as both players agree and the system is random then it is fine, but I'm not a judge.

5)  At that level you should shuffle, not just cut.  I think you are actually required to shuffle.

6)  Never made it that far, but I think that top 8 gets to see their opponent's deck lists before their matches."

finalDraft_v012,Fitness,1391099353.0,"Wow, I'm sorry this happened to you.  I got molluscum via non sexual means as well...and spread it to my boyfriend.  We were both pissed about it and I had no idea where it came from.  My gyno told me it must be from sex because it's on my vulva, except we're monogamous and never had this for a long time.

Then I realized....I've been going in and out of different clinics to get my vulva examined for the past 4 months.  I've had 4 surgeries within that time frame as well, in that area.  LOTS of people were handling me there, and apparently someone or someTHING wasn't clean.  Personally I was pretty mad with my whole hospital experience, they also kept me waiting w/no food (can't eat before surgery) for 8 hrs while at the hospital w/only a gown...technically longer since I stopped eating the night before....my scheduled surgery got pushed back by 5 hours.  My immune system was also shot to hell at the time, because of the surgeries/medicine.

I tried the home remedy route as well; I have apple cider vinegar at home.  I did not leave it overnight but I did dab some with a swab on the bumps.  I let it air dry before bed, and reapplied in the morning.  I think leaving it on your skin overnight is way too harsh....  1 of mine has disappeared in 5 months (yay), about a week after I started dabbing vinegar.  I then got lazy after that but luckily, I only have 3 left and they're maturing. 

If you have a good immune system, and no cuts, you should be fine....most likely you had some micro lesions on your dick after masturbating, and the virus entered there.  Sorry :("

**You did not lie!!** If I say I'll try asparagus and I take a bite, decide I don't like it, and take no more bites I've tried asparagus. You said you'd try, you began the insertion, you didn't like it, and you decided not to do that anymore. You tried, and he's being a manipulative piece of shit by making anal a ""trust"" issue. 

He has boundary problems. He isn't respecting what you want to do in bed. He's agreeing to uphold boundaries and then using the intimacy you share to violate your body and your boundaries. I'm not one of the 'dump him' people; I think that good communication and time will get people over a lot of problems that other people here tend to see as deal-breakers. But doing something I don't like, when I've repeatedly asked you not to do it, in the context of sex is so far past acceptable that I don't even know what to say. 

You can't talk about this because he doesn't want to listen. He's not listening, he's putting his desires first. Fuck that noise. The next step is to get serious with him and tell him he has to accept anal is off the table or you're going to be off the table and then hold him to it. You have to be a tough mother' here and stand up for your right to dictate how your body is touched because that is your right to decide. 

In his defense, which is hard for me because I am pissed as fuck with him, sometimes people (especially guys) get a message that they just need to try harder. That if they are persistent and patient, they get what they want. So perhaps it is the case that he thinks that including anal foreplay into sex will awaken you to the idea and he's not really properly contextualizing how much of a no-no his behavior is. But the only way to get that across is to get fucking pissed. Next time he does this I'd stop the sex, get dressed, and end the session. If he can't listen to your boundaries, he can't be naked with you. You have to put your actions/words where your feelings are and leave no room for doubt that this is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable behavior. It might also be wise to, in the beginning gestures of sex, take his face in both hands, make eye contact, and remind him that any butt-play is not okay. Cut it off at the pass. If he really is confused and not a manipulative piece of shit, being firm, assertive, and pro-active might pound this idea into his head enough that he can move on and enjoy the sex acts you are willing and eager to share with him. 

If that doesn't work though, I forbid you to keep dating him. If he really can't hear your boundaries, you dump him like a  hot rock and you move on to a guy that can and does listen. "

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391099555.0,"Fair corrections, all. If anyone is looking for a text basis for /u/WalkingTarget's statements, I recommend *Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age* in the Silmarillion.

&gt;Now the Elves made many rings; but secretly Sauron made One Ring to rule all the others, and their power was bound up with it, to be subject wholly to it and to last only so long as it too should last. And much of the strength and will of Sauron passed into that One Ring; for the power of the Elven-rings was very great, and that which should govern them must be a thing of surpassing potency; and Sauron forged it in the Mountain of Fire in the Land of Shadow. And while he wore the One Ring he could perceive all the things that were done by means of the lesser rings, and he could see and govern the very thoughts of those that wore them.

&gt;But the Elves were not so lightly to be caught. As soon as Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger they were aware of him; and they knew him, and perceived that he would be master of them, and of an that they wrought. Then in anger and fear they took off their rings. But he, finding that he was betrayed and that the Elves were not deceived, was filled with wrath; and he came against them with open war, demanding that all the rings should be delivered to him, since the Elven-smiths could not have attained to their making without his lore and counsel. But the Elves fled from him; and three of their rings they saved, and bore them away, and hid them.

&gt;Now these were the Three that had last been made, and they possessed the greatest powers. Narya, Nenya, and Vilya, they were named, the Rings of Fire, and of Water, and of Air, set with ruby and adamant and sapphire; and of all the Elven-rings Sauron most desired to possess them, for those who had them in their keeping could ward off the decays of time and postpone the weariness of the world. But Sauron could not discover them, for they were given into the hands of the Wise, who concealed them and never again used them openly while Sauron kept the Ruling Ring. Therefore the Three remained unsullied, for they were forged by Celebrimbor alone, and the hand of Sauron had never touched them; yet they also were subject to the One.

So *all* the Elven Ring-bearers took off their Rings when the One was forged, and the Three were just ""unsullied,"" not out of the One Ring's control."

1. **The US is about to fall (or at least soonish)** It's still the most powerful country on the planet. It still has it's laws set to preserve itself. And any size revolution would be snuffed out by the national guard let alone the Army, Navy, and Air Force. I think it's farcical to say that the US is near it's end. Don't forget that places east of the Mississippi river are much more content than the west. In my opinion the move that starts the dominos falling is when Cascadia gets a vote in Congress/Parliament that enables them to peacefully leave the country.

2. **Building dual power systems and living sustainably like the first nations people did.** Any system built inside the Federal system is inherently controlled by the Federal system. Let's say we really nail hydro-electric power generation. Like we design the best dam there ever was and the fish love it and cargo ships love it. It's just great. It will still be controlled by the federal government! They may decide to sell most of that electricity to California like they currently do. Does that help the ecology of the West Coast? Fuck no. It encourages more people to live in California and force more water from the neighboring states to satisfy the thirst down there. And it's not like we can say ""No, keep it here."" it's not under our control. Furthermore, you talk about living sustainably which is a great goal. But you can't use the First Nation's peoples as a guide for that. They ran a population that was a sliver of what we currently run. The reason it was easy for them to be sustainable is that there were so few of them. We don't have the luxury so we have to look elsewhere for answers.

3. **By passing local ordinances that actually state that all power is derived from the consent of the governed and that the rights of communities...**  This isn't possible while still working under the Constitution. Delegation of powers is stated within the document and local ordinances don't supersede those in any case that I can think of. If you want actual, meaningful power, you need to break down those ties first (either by secession or autonomous region status.) And yes I did take a look at the link you posted. I didn't see anything on there that makes me think they have found a way to change jurisdiction from federal/state levels to communities.

4. **Produce things locally, weave baskets from ivy...** This is hippie, pipe dream bullshit, if you'll excuse my French. In my Cascadia we'll produce things for sure but we'll be sending OUR shit to China for a profit. Green tech, Bio-tech, cars, planes, software, agro-business. We'll make plenty that will stay here but we have to live in a world economy. We'll also have the benefit of being a player in the Pacific Rim. Japan, Korea, China, Vietnam, Russia, Australia, etc. These will be big trading partners with us. I can get along with using toilet paper made in China so long as they buy our solar panels and 747's.

You seem a great dreamer and every country needs some of those but Cascadia needs blueprints and plans of attack right now. We'll call you off the bench when all the hard work is done."

Geohump,Christianity,1391099621.0,"The verses in Leviticus that appear to condemn male homosexuality are quite likely a mistranslation that is actually condemning ancient Middle Eastern practice of pederasty. Sadly this practice still continues today and is so firmly embedded in the Middle Eastern culture that at least one American military contractor, ""DynCorp"", actually paid for ""dancing boys"" to perform for the Afghan military commanders at a meeting.

the fact that nowhere in the Bible is lesbianism condemned, combined with the fact that there is an academic debate about the actual meaning of the words that were translated to mean homosexuality, versus a man boy (pederast) meaning, seems to indicate that the Bible isn't actually condemning homosexuality, because if it were then both sexes of homosexuality would be condemned, not just one.

Combine that with the fact that 7 to 10% of almost all chordate manuals exhibit naturally occurring homosexual behavior and we can see that homosexuality is simply part of the natural diversion behavior of species here on earth.

In other words homosexuality was part of God's creation, not a divergence from it.

Pederasty, on the other hand, is abuse of children

(""Dancing boys"" is a euphemism used to refer to these boys who are dressed up in feminine outfits and dance and perform for men at meetings, and then later have sexual relations with some of the adult men. Interestingly these adult men do not consider themselves to be homosexuals, and generally also have sexual relations with women, especially their wives. Pederasty is also known to occur in a high rate within the Catholic Church priesthood. According to psychiatrists, pederasty is not a form of homosexuality but a separate condition.)"

zakificus,starcitizen,1391099726.0,"Yeah, my goal is to either get the consumer version of the Rift, or the latest TrackIR when I finally upgrade my system later this year.

I saw a post earlier about the Razer Orbweaver, and in it some other keypads with thumbsticks were mentioned. Since most of them are programmable and the game should offer a lot of manual control, I thought having both thumbs on 8 direction hats or thumbsticks would be good for movement. And the buttons would optimize access to system controls.

With free look being more natural to survey things outside the cockpit. Plus it minimizes going back and forth to a keyboard and joystick if I go with the Rift. 

I have pretty good fine movement with my fingers and hands, so I could crank up the sensitivity to max for the thumb sticks and as long as they're high enough quality I should be able to make great use of the small degree of motion something like the Logitech G13 or similar."

It perpetuates the myth that people with ASD are to be pitied, and that their families are to be pitied. It allows sensationalist articles about people with ASD, especially those with violent tendencies, to be perpetuated, as if all people with ASD are violent. It allows sympathetic articles about parents killing their autistic kids because they can't cope, as if that were excusable. (Better funding and awareness of mental health would also help.)

Sensationalist stores of people with ASD harm the millions of people with ASD who aren't ""non-functional"" or ""violent"" or ""burdens"" because these aren't the norm. It pushes awful organizations like Autism Speaks to search for a ""cure"" or at least a genetic test so we can abort them all so that parents don't have to work with a child whose only ""fault"" was that their brain is wired in a way we don't comprehend yet.

Sorry, but this subject makes me angry. We're definitely at a point with autism where there's ""awareness"" but it's very incomplete, focuses on extremes, and it incorrectly pigeonholes a lot of people. Okay, soapbox over."

theBergmeister,Christianity,1391099895.0,"&gt;""A day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as a day."" 2 Peter 3:8

This is saying that where God resides, time in the conventional linear constant rate does not hold. Since we already know that God is immaterial and is not within physical space, it makes sense that He would also not be within time. Not that He cannot experience time or that He has no knowledge of it, it's just that He is not controlled by time as we are, but He controls the time He experiences. He could see our lives and the history of the universe as a blip or view it in the finest detail.

The implications for predestination and free will are that they are not differing opposed theologies, but two sides of a coin, one is our perspective within time, and one is God's from outside time. What people may see as inconsistency in the scripture is simply some written from God's perspective and some written from ours.

The thing to be taken away from this is that it's never too late for someone to change if their being genuine, and that if you simply give up and give into fate, you're doing it to yourself. You're writing your fate as you go, and while God sees where you're going to go and what you're going to do, His foreknowledge does not interfere with the fact that your actions are your actions.

MarvinTheAndroid42,AdviceAnimals,1391099937.0,"It doesn't help it brake, or rather it shouldn't.

I drive a Subaru which, unlike your examples, is a manual sedan with full time all wheel drive but it still counts. When braking with the brakes and the clutch in, you could have one wheel drive and it would brake the same. When you engine brake in any car, FWD, RWD, AWD, or 4x4 you're only matching revs and letting them drop naturally. Assuming you aren't hitting the gas(and using a more powerful section of the powerband, possibly breaking traction) then you'll slow down just the same. Besides, engine braking, while great, won't actually stop you, and it won't do it quickly unless you downshift 2 or more gears.

Braking doesn't care about anything but the brakes and tires. Now, AWD cars are *far* more likely to have all disks(though VW also uses all discs, as well as others I'm sure) but even then, this whole thing is about stopping in the snow and the trick there is to brake as close as possible to the point where you lose traction so you can stop quickly without locking the wheels.

The *only* time I can see this being a problem is in automatics because they always power the wheels but I doubt companies have yet to account for that.

I'm not sure if I'm agreeing with you but we don't want people to think that there's any way that their AWD will brake better. If Subaru's do brake better in the snow it's most likely due to the fact that their ABS system cones from the same technology that is used in planes built by Fuji Heavy Industries."

Small-government types tend to be more worried about bad government and figure that the best way to fix it is to remove it. Large-government types try to remove incompetence and corruption from the system and then tend to compensate for the bad with more good.

doMinationp,FireflyFestival,1391099968.0,"&gt;How much is it? I saw that it's $250 a person but then how do you get a camp site and how much is that?

At the moment, GA 4-day passes are $249/person. General camping is $149/campsite and Wednesday Premier camping is $169/campsite. Each campsite can hold up to 5 people. [Firefly Camping Passes](http://fireflyfestival.com/lodging/#GeneralTentCamping)
  
&gt; Do you get searched on your way in? I don't drink but I wanna bring in a lot of weed. And are they ok with us using it just around the campsite?

You get searched on the way into the festival grounds. If you're camping, they say they search upon entry but I have never witnessed it. If it's around the campsite, it's fine.

&gt; Can I put my MFLB batteries on the cell phone charger and how safe is it to leave anything there?

No idea. The cell phone charging area last year was just a strip of power outlets. You need to bring your own charger and it should be pretty safe to leave it there for an hour. During the day before/after the festival, there's always plenty of people there waiting around for their phone to charge. 

&gt; Is it safe to leave things in your tent when your gone?

I haven't had any problems leaving sleeping bags, food, or clothing in the tent during the day. If you have any valuables or anything you don't want to risk losing, you can always lock it up in your car. 

&gt; I also wanna bring outside food in because I assume food there is very expensive and can you bring a cooler with ice in? Thanks for reading

You can bring pretty much whatever with you to your campsite. You cannot bring outside food into the festival area. 

For clarification, the festival area is where all the stages will be. The camping area is outside the festival area. "

since this is your first ticket, your insurance may go up slightly, but it won't be a big deal. the ticket itself however could be a big chunk of money.

you could call the court and ask them how much the ticket will cost, and how much would it be if you took it to court and lost, then figure out whether it's worth it or not. i personally have taken tickets to court several times. one was dismissed out right because the officer had created an illegal ""speed trap"". another was dismissed because the officer didn't show up in court (be sure to check the box that requires the officer to appear, otherwise they just send in a written statement and its your word against theirs). another time it was reduced from going 70 in a 55 to going 65 in a 55, which reduced the amount i had to pay and was 1 point on my insurance rather than 2. the other times, i had to pay. as long as you didn't admit to speeding when you were talking to the officer (which is a guilty plea) you can ""roll the dice."""

If you have a hierarchical legal system, as long as there are multiple courts at a given level, you have the possibility of splits in the law until resolved at a higher level. I see no reason patent cases are special. On the other hand, the Supreme Court takes patent cases at a higher than representative rate, so it's arguably going to be in better shape than, say, admiralty law. 

The CAFC monopoly has significant costs beyond the fact that the judges have a pro-plaintiff bias. Circuit splits are often resolved without SCOTUS intervention as ideas and reasoning percolate among the circuits and the rule that makes the most sense emerges from the marketplace of ideas. In the absence of other circuits, the CAFC has little to challenge potentially poor reasoning. On top of that, circuit splits help put the Court on notice that a particular question is worth a cert grant. Without that cue, the Court has resorted to calling for the views of the SG in patent cases. It's far from clear that that's an adequate substitute. "

also, in the two weeks leading up, notice triggers and distractions. make plans to avoid/address them now.

If dick jokes aren't really a part of your dating life, though they may be a part of your friend/social life, you might just want to leave that out.   If they are a part of your dating life, you might want to work on that.

What, you don't like cutting code?  

everything else is pretty solid.   Lots of hooks to start conversations off of.

**good at**

Irishing?  Yea.. replace that term.   Any things you're good at that make you a nice choice to date?   How deep are you certified to dive?  If you're looking to be an instructor you must be pretty good at it?

**first thing**

again.. if you're in the habit of offended dates with your dark humor, work on *not* doing that that.. if you do not, don't include it in your dating profile.

**Favorites**

Not bad, but spelling and possible auto correct errors.. proof read and fix.  *I can be own over with hamachi kama* I presume won over.

myrrlyn,teslore,1391100229.0,"There's nothing inherently special about ""Legion"" armor that makes it so that only a military force calling itself a Legion and under the banner of an Empire can wear it. It's Cyrodiilic design, being worn in Cyrodiil.

Although the Reman dynasty ended with the First Era, a centralized power structure did remain in Cyrodiil, operating from the City. Cyrodiil isn't destroyed and lost; it's merely non-dynastic, similar to the events following the end of the Septim Dynasty in the Fourth.

And nobody in Tamriel would willingly disband their full army; they'd just be asking to be conquered immediately. It's very likely that the military isn't as centralized, and individual cities and families have their forces, but there will still be a military presence throughout Cyrodiil. And with the City in constant fighting, Cyrodiil's forces are likely mostly dispatched there with teams in the countryside fending off Anchor points because despite the triple invasion, Cyrodiil is still a province with peasants and daily lives to maintain and they'll need those in order to be able to keep fighting.

But yeah in short an armor style does not a Legion make. It's just the chosen aesthetic of Cyrodiil. They may call themselves Legions, since that's the Cyrodiilic word for large-group-of-soldiers, but the Remanite Empire is collapsed, yes, and Cyrodiil is more fragmented than it was.

But that's wholly separate from troops wearing ""Legion-looking"" armor.

____

Remember, Cyrodiil isn't out to conquer Tamriel with the aid of Bal. Bal is conquering Tamriel, CYRODIIL INCLUDED, and Cyrodiil is fighting back. Bal's Mundric allies are power-hungry idiots and ambitious cultists, not the entire Heartland."

1.  Take a breath.  You have ~9 months to prepare.
2.  Panic.  You only have ~9 months to prepare.
3.  Sign up for a pre-natal class to learn what the birthing process is like.  It's not like the movies.  
4.  Ignore all anecdotes and advice from older relatives if their youngest child is older than ~10 years.
5.  Birthing procedures vary greatly depending on your country.  But I highly recommend talking to a midwife if that option is available to you, if for nothing else to see what your options are and what the difference is between a midwife and an obstetrician.
6.  Let your wife have nearly 100% of the say in deciding decor for the baby's room.  This is how she builds a nest.
7.  If you don't already subscribe, sign up for Netflix or some other streaming service.  Otherwise you'll be watching infomercials at 4am because nothing else is on.  ""Why will I be watching TV at 4am?"" you ask.  You will learn.
8.  Diapers are not scary.  They're as complicated as putting on shorts.  So don't fret it.

comatoseraccoon,medicine,1391100312.0,"&gt; it's possible that by lowering the bar of entrance as well as accepting more students would not adversely affect the medical industry. 

There would be a few problems with this.  For one, there would be insufficient spots available for residency since that is primarily funded via Medicare and there are barely enough spots as it is.  Furthermore you'd see a huge impact on the quality of training that residents get simply because of insufficient caseload per person.  There's already a growing issue with physicians not being as well prepared doing old school basic procedures such as ulcer repairs simply because modern medicine has drastically reduced once common problems.  Lastly lowering the bar to entry opens the possibility of something like what's happening to the legal industry occurring.  At the moment there are,  I believe, around 50,000ish new law school grads that come out every year but only about half that number of jobs available thereby screwing most of those law school graduates who are now not only unemployed but also carrying $200,000+ of debt.

The story goes like this: When the LRT started out, they wanted to have LRT services all over the city (like Calgary). The controversial decision to have the LRT underground for the downtown leg costed too much. Busses made money while the LRT constantly lost money. Their good intentions of preserving the aesthetics of downtown prevented the LRT from expanding. That is, until now, and it's only because the oil industry is booming again.

At least they learned from their mistakes and are building LRT routes above ground. However, I think their latest DISASTROUS mistake is privatization. IMPark and whatever company they get to run their new LRT legs will severely cripple services that citizens depend on. Privatization will reduce accessibility to the people who need the service most."

At the U14 Elite level my son's team commonly breaks academy teams down and defeats them simply by taking 10 minutes of game time to understand how they play and then adapting to it. Many academy teams however don't seem to have that ability. They play how they play and if that doesn't work then they're screwed, they have limited ability to get creative or adapt.

MN_Wild_Rice,AskReddit,1391100544.0,"Frequent Marijauna user here, as well as having dabbled extensively in just about every other drug, hard and soft alike. It has been my experience that drugs, whether sniffing some coke or smoking a blunt, change who you are as a person, fundamentally. Its like virginity, you either are or you're not someone who has used a mind-altering substance. It stays with you, some much more that others. Sometimes this is a good thing, and often this can be a bad thing.

Don't get misunderstand me, I'm not saying once you smoke, you're in for life. Many people do not become habitual users of the substances they imbibe recreationally- however, you have experienced something drastically different than your normal mindset, and I have always believed that this changes you a bit.

Now, in terms of legal status, I feel that most drugs should be frowned upon. However, I've never believed in imprisoning penniless hard-drug addicts for the sake of filling the prison system- non-violent offenders should be giving to a treatment-type institution, which while like a prison, don't always have the negative social stigma's associated with them (""Oh, you're an ex-convict? No job/house/car/loan for you""). On that same level, there are some drugs that need to be better researched and understood, NOT just from a scientific point of view, but from a social aspect- if I gave four ex-convicts low doses of LSD or Psilocybin as a part of a larger reconditioning regiment, would they respond to treatment or reintegration better? Do heroin addicts recover better if they have a crutch drug like marijuana? (Methadone and suboxone are great, until they become a new full time addiction- marijuana could be used in conjunction with opiate-replacement therapies as a sort of weening-off-the-ween-off process).

This is not to say I think drugs should be legalized- I have the controversial view within my group of stoner friends that medical legalization is great, but that full legalization should be examined a little more before everyone begins to cry for it. If we knew in the prohibition days that alcohol would cause as many social and legal problems as it does now (I come from a shitty household with an alcoholic abusive mother, so yes, I know first hand that it causes MANY of those problems), would we have allowed it the leeway and social status it has today? If there was a limit to how much beer you could have on you at once, or buy from a single store, for example, maybe things would be different in our country- or maybe not. Hard to tell, as with any addicting substance, the users ALWAYS find a way to get their fix.

:D Long read, but hope it gets some screen times. Drugs are a vastly misunderstood social/legal/economic problem- to cure, we must first truly understand."

If a person has constant insecurity and self-doubt, then they need to reach out to a professional for help.

My great aunt who was on Medicare never had to wait long for any surgery she had to have, whether it was for cataracts or to put her pace maker in, she was always in good hands and well taken care of.

Also, can I ask what country you live in? I'm willing to bet that it is quite a bit smaller then the 320 million people split up between 50 states. Has any country with our size and makeup even tried universal healthcare? We cant even get our shit together for a federal exchange marketplace. It would be beyond a shit-show.

Look, I am all for getting our uninsured population insured in some way or offering them assistance. I dont think that pre-existing conditons or costs should keep people from being able to seek medical treatment.

That does not mean that I think everyone who is happy with their healthcare should be forced to switch to something that likely will not be as good as what they currently have. Sure it may be cheaper, but a large portion of this country is perfectly ok with paying more for private insurance. I know I am. 

And in my group of friends I dont know a single person who supports universal health care. Its not because we're evil monsters who think poor people deserve to suffer and die in agony.

In the textbook that was used in my abnormal psychology classes, Schizotypal Personality Disorder is on the scale for Schizophrenia.  I don't have any personal experience with someone going through a schizophrenic episode, mild or severe, but I know people who struggle with schizophrenia.  [This](http://psychcentral.com/lib/types-of-schizophrenia/000714) webpage has some helpful information about why symptoms may not be apparent for awhile.  I wish I knew more about what less severe symptoms look like, but most of the time the sufferer is hiding them because they don't want people to think poorly of them.  In my classes, the teachers also only used examples of the most extreme cases to help us remember the symptoms.  I wish I had more information to add, but I haven't had a lot of opportunity to get actual experience yet.

If I told you that my company has the ability to cure cancer, but it needs 10 crores rupees, and the cure may or may not be found in about ten years, will you give me that money as an individual? If I sold stocks of my company, would you buy it? Why? What's the guarantee that the stock will do well?

That's where the government comes in. The govt is the only entity that has the ability to swallow a big loss and move on. When the first European kingdoms wanted to explore the oceans to find India, it wasn't the private moneylenders who financed Magellan or Vasco da Gama. It was the king himself. Because he could afford to lose the money. When the moon or Mars had to be explored, it wasn't Boeing or Airbus that created the technology, it was the US and Indian and Russian governments. For the same reason. Only because orbital flight has been thoroughly understood, the risks assessed, and the costs reduced, have now private companies (like SpaceX) begun to offer flights to outer space. 

That's why a vibrant government that invests in moon-shot projects and keeps the funding on various projects will inevitably be inside a powerful country. Think China."

he'd never asked for this report specifically so I had to write it. i gave it to him. he then chastised me in front of the controller, and sales director for not providing him with the report he wanted, and pretty much called me an idiot for the numbers being so egregiously off. 

we then had a discussion (and, by discussion i mean me telling him the mathematical formula for deriving the margin of profit vs. the markup of a product).

in the end, he would not admit that he did not know the difference between margin and markup and just said ""well, we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one.""

i would not let it go. if you're going to try and embarrass me in front of my peers, then I will shame you in to submission with very straight-forward math that even my 8-yr old could understand. in the end, everyone in the room was nodding their heads in approval with my explanations--except for him.

harle,ffxiv,1391100980.0,"&gt;tl;dr If you want to profit in crafting, skill is irrelevant. What counts is being the first to tap an under-utilized market and be able to make a quick buck and move on.

Ah, that's a succinct way of putting it.

I didn't mean to imply it took skill. When I referred to skills I meant the action-type skills, cross-class ones, and the time it takes to familiarize yourself with their interactions in non-ideal setups. You're right in that the AH is very much centered around hunting under-supplied items. I wouldn't say it's so much &lt;moving on&gt; though. You get to know which items inherently have a high profit margin, and then can cycle your retainer inventory based on what's low supply or selling fast. Some days it's simply more profitable to go gathering &amp; not craft at all."

Now, insurance company coming down on me like a ton of bricks did the trick. I am fairly frugal and didnt want to pay the extra premiums, higher deductibles, etc. So I started by gradually cutting back. I stopped going inside gas stations, for any reason. I paid outside and stayed away from the temptation of buying them. 

The first three days of 0 cigs sucked. After the crankiness wore off I started to gradually feel better. I had cravings for years though, and I still will smoke if I get drunk. Luckily, I'm not a drinker, so that maybe means once or twice a year I smoke one or two cigs. 

I'm glad I quit, but there have been some side effects from smoking that havent gone away after. Overall, I do feel better. I don't run out of breath as easily and my sense of smell came back a little bit. Not a lot though. I smell more than my still smoking husband, but I dont think it will ever go back to being what it was.

Slowly I started to time myself to other people. When they lit up, i pulled out my blu, when they tossed their butt, I put my blu away. same at work on smoke breaks. Eventually it got colder outside and I said fuck it, ill just do my smoke break at my desk

after about a month, I ran out of menthol cartridges. I had to order more, with the free points I got from a redditor. The cartridges I got, tasted like burning rubber. Absolute shit, to the point I was gagging and felt nausea from using them.  That was it. I tossed my blu back in the box, and in the center console it went.  That was the final straw.   From then on, I was smoke free. I went from april, till about june, when a friend offered me a drag of his smoke while were drunk in Atlantic City. I said sure lets see what happens, and I took a drag. Man that tasted like pure shit , I was gagging, hacking, i looked like a beginner on his first cigarette. Thats when I realized, i was happy I quit. I then turned most of my friends over and they all vape now.

I only use a vape for trees , but im glad im smoke free now. I feel better, although, the smell of 2nd hand smoke makes me gag, and I hate coming home from a night of poker and stinking like an ash tray, only now I can actually smell the difference between clean clothes, and clothes covered in smoke. I have to immediately through them in the wash when I get home so the house doesnt stink of stale smoke (to me)

When it comes down to it, the Safety Pilot devices are really powerful sensors, and I don't think driverless cars will benefit much more than traditional cars from them.  Even if this was a magic bullet, they're taking all the Safety Pilot devices out soon.

A POCO is a Player Owned Customs Office. They are deployed around a planet as a waystation for goods being ferried off the planet. A pilot (or corporation) can set up colonies on the planets to produce specilized goods. Once those goods are produced, they need to be shot offworld and dock at the POCO. The POCO stores those goods until they can be picked up by somebody. 

If the POCO is destroyed with goods inside, the goods are destroyed along with the POCO. Also, if you own the POCO, you could set a tax rate for people to use it. Generally a corporation gives preferential treatment for it's own members and price gauges anyone else who wants to use it."

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1391101203.0,"You're right, it is less weird to ask someone out after you've established a rapport with them, but that's always true regardless of how you ask them out.  If you do the way you wrote, though, you will never know if she didn't call because you were being too indirect about what you wanted or if she just didn't want to date you. 
 
""Here's my card if you need anything?"" is too vague. Your intention is unclear. If you say that to a girl, she will most likely never call you, and you will feel rejected. Meanwhile, she will have no idea that you were trying to ask her out. The alternative is that she does call you because she wants to invite you to another volunteering gig. Then you have no idea whether she invited you platonically or because she liked you. In that case you would still have to make a move on her later and risk embarrassing yourself. You can't avoid it. You can just save yourself a lot of trouble if you ask more directly. You also have a higher chance of getting a date, because you minimize the chance that she misunderstands your intentions.

A better way is to say ""You're beautiful, I've enjoyed today and I'd like to take you to dinner sometime."" But still in this case, it would be equally fine to just give her your number without a card. There's nothing really wrong with giving her a card...just know that it is not really a normal practice. You risk coming off as kind of nerdy and the type of guy who tries to act older than he is, the type of guy who will wear a tux to a first date and try to do everything by some imaginary rulebook on how to be a gentleman. If that's your style, then go with it, but just know that most people will see you as stiff and aloof, albeit maybe charming (in the way that someone can be awkwardly charming whilst trying too hard). 

Anyway, it seems like you are overly preoccupied with these things you need to do to be ready to ask girls out. There is no checklist to prepare, so drop that notion. But if you think business cards will help your game, then why are you talking about it like it's something you'll figure out way off in the future? You can print your own decent looking ones at home. You don't need a job title on there. In fact, for this purpose, it's better if you make something creative so that the girls get the idea that you're a fun guy, not just a wanna-be businessman. If you find a way to make your business card unique, then yeah, go for it. Just do it because you want to be unique, not because you think it's necessary.

CambodianDrywall,whowouldwin,1391101426.0,"I like the Goonies as much as the next child-of-the-80s, but a Predator is way too OP for that gang.

Obviously the Fratellis go first.  Ma and her three sons are hung from the rafters of that closed down diner and their spines/skulls are removed at the Predator's leisure.  

Whether the Goonies live or die is entirely up to them.  Back off and don't engage --- no issues.  The Predator goes after more sporting game.  But the moment Brandon goes all teenage-testosterone-ragey, he's getting two-feet of alien alloy shoved through his torso.  A full-body skinning is all he has to look forward to.

Data could sufficiently piss off the Predator.  Not with a booby-trap (Predator can spot those easily enough), but an unexpected boxing glove to the face....Short Round goes down.

Mikey's asthma saves him unless he uses his inhaler as an impromptu torch to try and set fire to the Predator.  Chunk?  Please...  Chubby kid dies first, while squealing in pain.  I suppose Mouth could talk himself into a killing, but his safest strategy is to run away with Stef and Andy.  Avoid the killing field entirely."

This update is mainly designed to prepare the game for the upcoming release of the expansion pack Battlefield 4 Second Assault. We will announce the release date for this expansion pack later.


**DMR Balance Tweaks**

* Increased the damage of all DMRs across all ranges. Specifically, damage has been increased at long ranges to allow three-hit kills against unarmored opponents. Additionally, reduced the penalty to accuracy for sustained DMR fire, allowing more rapid follow up shots in combat. The amount of the damage increase varies from weapon to weapon, according to its intended range, rate of fire, and damage. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of DMRs in combat, and determine if additional action is needed to make DMRs a viable mid to long range weapon.

**Other items**

* Significantly reduced the duration of the black screen when spawning in, and fixed the issue with players getting killed before being in-game

* Greatly reduced the risk of crosshairs disappearing, which would also result in hit markers disappearing

* Added a headshot icon on the killcard. This should help identify instances where players are correctly killed by one shot

* Fixed an issue in Squad Deathmatch where the “Win/Lose” text was overlapping

* Fixed an issue with players using an exploit for the SOFLAM

* Fixed an issue with players using an exploit for the MAV

* Fixed the gameplay code to properly track the FOV (Field of View) changes in the options menu

* Fixed an issue where chat would break when entering ""false"" or ""true"" in the chat window

* Fixed an out-of-helicopter glitch in Air Superiority where players could spawn on the ground and play as infantry

* Fixed the misaligned crosshairs on the T90 MBT

* Added setting to tweak joystick dead zone

bombeater,BDSMcommunity,1391101615.0,"(*Nitpick: ""dominant"" is the adjective/noun and ""dominate"" is the verb*.)

Healthy BDSM relationships are founded on a mutual sense of respect and fulfillment. If you think you have that, go for it.

Note that I specifically didn't say ""attraction"". If you're not sexually attracted to him, but you enjoy teasing and playing with him, that's fine as long as he isn't mistakenly thinking that you're doing it because you find him sexy.

Basically the most important thing is **you need to make sure you are both on the same page**.

Go ahead and broach the subject of meeting up again, but be clear in your expectations, and make sure he's clear about his own.

Drop the BDSM and talk to him as a human being.

**Drop the BDSM and talk to him as a human being**. During that conversation, if you wouldn't say it to a non-submissive partner, don't say it to him.

Establish clear boundaries and expectations as *equals*, then feel free to drop back into the play. Tell him: ""I'm not sexually attracted to submissive guys, but I get off on the teasing and playing, so I need to know that you're OK with that. I haven't had a relationship like this before so I don't know how my needs or desires might grow or fade as we go.""

It's not mean if you are genuinely enjoying yourself. If you lose interest over time, well, guess what: it happens! It happens to everyone, in many circumstances. At that point you are well within your rights to say ""Sorry, this just didn't turn out to be what I wanted."" Just don't wait to do it."
portugalthephilosoph,AskReddit,1391101616.0,"Sorry, I wasn't asking about *snorting* raw marijuana, but the odor or the raw buds can be just as strong as the smoke sometimes. 

The argument FOR taking drugs, however, is one that a professor briefly mentioned during an epistemology lecture in my junior year of college. He couldn't remember the name of the philosopher who first formed the argument, and the closest thing I have been able to find since is a few articles by Sam Harris, who I usually don't agree with. 

The argument goes like this:
Epistemology is all about understanding human knowledge, and how we come to *know*. This argument also plays into metaphysics somewhat, just because drugs alter our perception of reality.
When someone takes a psychoactive drug, their mind is altered in a way that allows for different types of knowledge to be accessed. This is a *unique* type of knowledge only available through psychoactives, whether it be through hallucinations, increased awareness, or some sort of ""higher consciousness"". 
Since epistemology requires one to study all types of knowledge (edit: double word), then an epistemological education would be incomplete without trying to expand the mind in all ways possible: aka, drugs. 

There is obviously a cost/benefit analysis that has to go on here. Snorting Anthrax or Sarin gas are not likely to give you expanded knowledge, or at least not at a level worth the risk of (horrible) death.
But for something like marijuana, LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, the risk of long term damage from a single dose is marginally low and therefore the benefit of the expanded knowledge is greater. 

I understand there may be several holes in the argument, but its something I formed myself after the brief mention from my Professor. It could use a little fine-tuning. "

- Fashion (If they dress in jeans/tshirt all day, or like to wear floral-print dresses, or maybe even hats or beanies)
- Body shape (This kind of goes with gait, but identifying people by their height, weight, hip size, shoulder width)

Most of these things are kind of pointless if the person is sitting in a chair and not moving, though!

Whenever I encounter such people in this world, I try to remind myself that they must have experienced trauma themselves. Why else kick someone who is looking for understanding and advice? They are probably misunderstood, lonely or lost in their own life. They aren't ready to deal with their issues yet. But you are, because you took the time to thoughtfully write out your post hoping to get some help and just because the first person to find it was acting like an asshole, don't let that stop you from reaching out! 

As far as your life is concerned. You sound like a strong person who has dealt with a lot of pain, mostly because of your mother's choices. I'm not sure where you live, but I'm in the US. There are some programs available here where you can talk to a therapist and pay according to income if your health insurance doesn't cover it. Some people pay nothing. I think you might find talking to someone helpful. There is no shame in it. I know successful and well rounded therapists that have their own therapists.

Life is too short to let something that you are not responsible for, haunt you. It took me a long time to realize that myself and start fixing the things that were hurting me. You don't realize how heavy the load you are carrying is until you allow yourself to put it down. Once you do, you can sort through it, learn from it, realize how strong and awesome you really are and find out a lot of that stuff you were carrying wasn't even yours. Guilt is an especially heavy thing to carry, the gift that keeps on giving, until you deal with it properly. Don't let such things consume your entire life. Just because things happened in your life does Not mean you are broken. Everything is fixable.

Please feel free to ask me any questions or if you need help finding someone professional to talk to (PM me). I'm not a therapist, but I worked in the mental health field and had to deal with plenty of my own issues and I want to give you hope. I thought my life was already ruined and wasted years with that additude, but you'd be surprised what people can heal from :)

WinterCharm,Battlefield,1391102070.0,"**PSA** You MUST have the 14.1 Catalyst BETA drivers from AMD for mantle to work. 

&gt;In order to use Mantle you will need the following:
-AMD Catalyst 14.1 Beta drivers. AMD will post them here.
-AMD Radeon GPU with Graphics Core Next
-64-bit Windows (7, 8 or 8.1)

AMD has *not* posted them yet, but when they are posted, they will be posted here: http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/latest-catalyst-windows-beta.aspx

I encourage anyone with AMD hardware to try this out. From the article... 

* On an AMD APU with Integrated GPU, mantle is about 12% faster
* On the GPU: AMD Radeon 7970, mantle improves performance by25% 
* On the Crossfire GPU: 2x AMD Radeon R9 290x 4 GB We see up to 50% better performance (!!!!) 

So, Mantle will help you even if you have a high end GPU. :D 

At the very least, try it out when the link is live, because if it improves your FPS by 12-50% depending on your setup, it's VERY worth it.

**What to Test**

1. All the expected elements are present and say the right thing
1. Variations based on data (more on this below)
1. What happens when there is no data

For #1, I just test that the right things show up in the view. Does the view have a ""Save"" button? Then I check to make sure that it is there and says ""Save"". I don't try to ensure that it is in the correct position or anything like that ... but I do make sure that it is *present*.

\#2 is about presentation of the data. Perhaps a blog post's title field is optional, but I'm supposed to display the published date when the title is blank ... a ""display title"", if you will. I test to ensure that the title is displayed on a record where the title is not blank and I test to ensure that the display title is shown on a record where the title is blank.

\#3 is what to do when you have a table with no rows. Or sometimes you have a table that is supposed to always have eight items in it even when there is no data for two of the eight. I test to ensure that the right things show up in the view when expected records are not present.

**When to Test**

Same time as all the other tests run. They are included in every full pass. I additionally run a view's tests when the view is changed and I run all views' tests when any render template is changed.

**Is It Worth It**

An emphatic **YES**. View tests run really quickly so they are a quick indicator of at least a minimum of functionality. The way I write my view tests, I'm not guaranteed that things are laid out correctly or are the right color or anything ... but at least what I expect to be there is somewhere on the page and is recognizable.

You mention integration tests and this is something I feel very strongly about. Integration tests are slow. The more there are and the more complicated they are ... the slower they run. If you're trying to cover all of your views' functionality in your integration tests, that makes them exponentially more complicated ... which makes them even slower. When tests are slow, you don't want to run them as often. When you don't run tests as often bugs slip in. When bugs slip in, bugs make it out to production. When bugs make it out to production, they cost you a lot more money. [And all for the want of a horse shoe nail ...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Want_of_a_Nail)

I'm not saying don't have integration tests. Do have them, but follow the [test pyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html) even in your UI tests. Make many, many more simple and fast tests (view tests) and fewer slower, end-to-end tests (UI integration tests).

Additionally, integration tests are really hard to write well. And what I mean by ""well"" is that when an integration test fails, it should point *directly* to where the failure occurred so that you can fix it quickly. But writing an integration test that can do that takes a TON of logging and metrics and other stuff that is a pain and tedious and boilerplate ... which means your integration tests are more likely to have bugs in them, which decreases their value even more. You know what is easy to write that points directly to where the failure occurred? Unit tests, which in the case of the UI are view tests.

Testing a UI isn't easy. But don't make it exponentially harder on yourself by cutting corners."

Why would anyone scoff at a degree? Someone taking three years of their life and paying for something to help them learn the craft, I have no idea why you would scoff at them.

I am by no means saying a degree makes you a better writer. While completing your degree, you're told that you should always be writing, getting published where you can. Similarly however, the degree gives you access to many things you otherwise wouldn't have had access to, especially if you're from a poorer background like myself.

One of my modules this year involved me learning In Design and creating a magazine from scratch, which has been praised by all sorts of people inside and outside of Uni and in the industry. Similarly, I created a website as part of a module, learning code etc. (documentary style site). All of these things help better my craft and can show to prospective employers that I am comfortable working in a magazine environment, I can write, I can design, I can target my work to a certain audience (it was a kids history magazine we made).

No degree is useless. I'm in the process of applying for more placements (already got one for the summer) and many of those placements, or jobs state that a degree is helpful and they usually don't employ people off of the bat without a degree. Places like Empire for example.

Don't get me wrong, you can work as a freelancer and build a portfolio with relevant experience. Get a job at local news organisations or a small tailored magazine and work your way up. This is a very viable route, but so is a degree. For some a degree is quicker and better, it all depends on the person.

But you can't say that it's easy to go online, set up a blog and therefore end up as a journalist. I have been writing for various sites/blogs for three years now (2nd year student) and I am still learning.

It's also no just about being able to write. Knowing the industry, ethics behind the industry, shorthand, laws and such. These are also things we study. To scoff at a degree and simply devalue its worth, I think, is wrong. Many editors come from the degree route, Joe Barnes editor of FHM and previously Front is one example. So it's not useless.

**EDIT:** Also, no one tells you what journalism is. All people teaching and studying know that there is not one clear way to do things. So I don't know where you got the idea a student has a pre conceived notion. We merely learn the craft and study the subject while creating our portfolios etc."

Your course of action now would be to apply for EI if you are laid off or unemployed now. If you quit for no good reason you will be denied. Once in, go to your local support office and make an appointment with a counselor. Once in the system you can look into programs to pay for schooling, setting up a business, or other funding such as equipment to rejoin the work force.

If you go into this, understand that it's not a free ride to hang out and tinker on a business idea. They will cease your payments and put restrictions on your future benefits."

During that time, his wife, my step-mother, told him that she would leave him if he lived through the surgery and picked up smoking again.

mintyJulips,AskWomen,1391102440.0,"I think it's appropriate to show vulnerability to someone once some emotional intimacy and trust has been established. This is true regardless of gender. It's awkward and uncomfortable to have a near stranger open up about his or her deepest troubles, because it shows an inability to pick up on social cues.

I think if a close friend or SO can't handle you opening up about an insecurity or a moment of self doubt, then they aren't worth keeping as a friend or romantic partner. 

Perpetual insecurity is off putting coming from anyone--male or female. I don't want an SO or friend who needs constant reassurance because it's exhausting and because I would never expect constant reassurance from them.

I will say that it baffles me when I hear accounts of women running away when their boyfriends or husbands open up to them about their fears/doubts/emotional state. To me, a central component to a romantic relationship is being able to be equally vulnerable with one another.  So, unless these guys are pouring on the histrionics, I don't get it."

If you are good enough you climb to plat in 50 games from bronze. But if you arent that good you'll need much more games to reach your true elo (aka just play the game and be consistent).

PS I noticed you never stated how many games you have played in ranked. If you played like 10 games only it's a high chance you got luck/unlucky to get that silver 2 or drop down to silver 5. On the other hand if you played 50+ games it's something you're doing wrong. You should analyze your plays and learn different roles to get even better understanding of the game.

On a side note, I think this illustrates the fundamental flaw with the reboot. There are many themes in the original that are still discussed and some brilliant moments in story telling. While not out yet, I don't see the reboot being anywhere as deep as the original and feel it will just be a shallow action film while not being, say, a critique on US society as one of the themes of the original had."

We posted a lookout where he was and move on towards the camp where we were receiving fire from the hills. Our marksman and us returned fire until it seems as though we hit one of them.

Unfortunately, it turns out the group we were shooting at were the Brits we parted with at Cherno. They were pinned by the lone sniper we killed but kept on firing.

JonWood007,EnoughLibertarianSpam,1391102556.0,"They would likely give some nice picturesque vision that wouldn't work in reality. 

And yeah, I agree. I think that we've been selling out too many liberties since 9/11. I'm willing to bend a little, but when you basically make 1984 come true...you're gonna have trouble getting my support. 

Military action is a bit trickier. I kind of thing a lot of it has to do with the fact that we still can't get past our old cold war thinking. Back then, everything was containment, containment, containment. If we didn't make a move establishing bases in countries, the Russians would, and they'd have a tactical advantage over us. To an extent, we STILL think like that, which is why we have this massive bloated military. We think, well, if we remove the bases, someone will do such and such and that would be a threat to us. And this might be true to a degree. But still, we're way overextended, and we don't need to be in every single country every time there's a problem. I think we should really go through our list of military bases and really make hard decisions about what is necessary, what is not. I can see us having stuff in south korea and japan for instance, to ward off north korea. I'm beginning to think, based on russia's lower military spending and lack of innovation, if it invaded Europe, it could probably do fine on its own. China, I think that's something to be concerned about, but I don't think they'll act on us because that would kill their biggest trading partner. And the middle east hates us because we are there, although if we pulled out, some would be afraid of oil shortages and stuff.

It's tricky. And this is how a foreign policy analyst needs to think. They have to do assessments of whether we need to be in these places, and then pull out if possible. Stay if needed to preserve our security and interests, but yeah. The problem is, ancaps reduce things to absurdly complex levels. They don't even think about ANY of the nuance mentioned above on this matter. They just think war is murder, taxation is theft, and then act categorically against such things, even though they're not understanding the larger context behind those things."

Drunk_Physicist504,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1391102560.0,"AP Shaco is a blast. His clear speed is decent if you max W, but his ganks suffer if you don't max E. Depending on the match up, I'll sometimes level W to 2 or 3 before maxing E. 

You want to gank lanes whenever you have red or someone is really pushed in lane. He's best at clean up kills or ambushing junglers though. Once team phase starts, he can do a variety of things. You can split push, secure objectives with boxes, use your boxes to wall off enemies from entering the fight, peel for your carry, or dive their backline. 

He also has a ton of build paths. All of the following are decent on him: Athenes, Banner of Command, DFG, Liandry's, Lich Bane, Morellonomicon, Ohmwrecker, Deathcap, RoA, SotSW, Twin Shadows, Void Staff, and Hourglass.

He actually is still a pretty decent split pusher if you itemize for it. I would say 40% cdr and a mana / mana regen item is recommended the majority of the time though, unless you're playing him as a straight burst assasin with lichbane and DFG. 

The trouble you run into with AP shaco is that your teammates will not know how to play with him. It gets incredibly frustrating when you spend 60 seconds setting up boxes and your teammate kites the enemy away from them, then rages at you for not doing enough. Or even worse, when your teammate kites minions into boxes you've been stacking."

My point was that you should always give your life an equal amount of love aswell. Keep a balance, because if you abandon everything but your partner, when your partner is gone, you are left with nothing in your life.  
  
And my story is so damn long, so damn painful and so damn complicated and confusing that I doubt anyone would want to hear it. Needness to say, I'm at the bottom of my life. I'm just tired of bothering people about it. But fuck it, I guess.  
  
The very short version is this. Atleast as short as I can get it to:  
She cheats last year, we almost break up, we move in together, she has increasing urges of seeing other guys, she begins to hide things from me, I become increasingly nosy, every time I look I find something, she begins to feel more and more ""choked"", I break up with her on (this) friday as she hides another Skype conversation in front of me, she is a little relieved, but devestated when I say that I'm sick of being lied to and that I will leave her as a friend aswell. I lose my strenth, and we agree to stay friends. She then becomes completely apathetic to my agony and tears. It starts driving me insane because she is showing zero gratitude for our time together, seems like she never cared for me in the slightest. Out of the blue, she tells me about how she wants an abusive relationship. A couple of days pass with turbulance, I read the original Skype log that she hid from me, turns out that it's way more severe than I thought, that even when we had broken up, she kept on lying to me, and that she was indescribably in love with him and completely crazed with sexual lust. During the break up, all she cared about was this guy that she had never even met in real life and known for 1-2 months. Not me. I was not important.  
  
She returns from work on monday. I tell her that I regret our three years together, that I no longer love her, that she never really loved me, and that she made a choice between an online fantasy and me. I tell her that she will never, ever see me again. She collapses. She hates herself, telling me how stupid she has been, how much she regrets it all, that she loves me (despite not wanting to be in a relationship, that much was very clear from the start) more than anything in the whole world, and so on. She says she has never felt more worthless in her entire life.  
  
I leave. I've been through hell since then, and yesterday, I cracked and sent her a long message, telling her everything I had gone through since then, both the positive and the negative. I couldn't find the strength anymore. She responds callously and angerly and blocks and deletes me. I made a fucking huge mistake contacting her. It was the dumbest thing I have ever done in my entire life. But alteast now, I know that it's all unsalvagable. Nothing can be fixed. I wanted her to feel like shit for what she had done. I wanted her to regret how she treated me, but now she hates me instead.  
  
Although it's quite clear that she is emotionally damaged, I made mistakes in our relationship. And the biggest mistake I did was what I described in the OP post."

OpticalDelusions,nfl,1391102656.0,"Sideline reporters, microphone jockeys, and locker room interviewers, you're becoming obsolete. We are entering a new era of communication that allows us, the fans, to communicate directly with the players through Twitter, reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and a plethora of other ""immediate-return"" sites. There are no filters on these other methods of information, no connotation, no bias, no editing. We aren't getting sound bytes anymore, we're getting the whole story straight from the player's mouth. There's no spin, it's an honest back-and-forth between the customer (NFL fans) and the vendor (NFL players). 

The vast majority of us don't care about post-game interviews. Any of us who have *played* football know that emotions and adrenaline are running rampant after a game. Nearly none of us have ever played football at the professional level, but we do have some former college players, and probably even some D1 players. To require a professional football player to stow his emotions and answer a battery of inane, tangentially-related-to-the-game questions is absurd, and it's beginning to show in your ratings. 

It's 2014. You either need to adapt to the changing landscape and scope of your job, or find yourself, like so many other outdated professions, unemployed. I hope for your sake that you find a way to make yourselves relevant again, because there is room for improvement. Instead of towing the company line, try thinking outside of the box.

The current issue it faces is that sometimes technology hinders interaction and creating those person-to-person meetings will mean more than 100 messages back and forth.

Hmmm... I have more ideas now... If I approached this project, I would probably do a lot of interviews with people (men and women) who do a lot of ""traditional"" dating as well as others who do online dating. I would love to do some fly on the wall observation and people watching (because that won't be mildly awkward...). It would be interesting to interview professional matchmakers and watch not.

But, like I said, they *aren't* an American source, so they won't have all or enough of the stories that you might want to hear about, because their audience isn't Americans (usually).

The best way to get the news is from more than one source at a time, you need to synthesize different views together to get a cohesive picture of what is happening. This means that you will have to look at things like MSNBC, Fox, CNN, and whatever else, even though you don't like their slant.

HighDice,AskWomen,1391102920.0,"THANK YOU!

That's an interesting question. I suppose one of the major things that affected what I wrote was the answers I received about being judged by others when they confessed their fantasies to someone. There were a number of women who were treated very judgmentally by both friends and even their partners. That was something that I really felt needed to be represented.

Also, there were a lot of women who wrote about the difficulty their partners had trying to get over the mental block of 'I don't want to hurt you!' There were certain ways that they described how they felt that triggered a greater understanding for me.

In the play the drama and the comedy of the narrative stems from the woman's frustration with her partner being unable to understand what she wants and why she wants it but also because of her difficulty communicating properly with him. So, when you read accounts from both sides of the proverbial coin - women who have loving relationships that integrate their fantasies into their relationships, and women who have been unable to do so - you get ideas of how you could manufacture conflict, which is pretty much a playwrights job, I think!

In fact, I think that what I found most helpful was the comments from women who are in sexually and emotionally satisfying relationships where they've worked out what they want with the partners. Because one you see how it can be made to work properly, you can figure out plausible ways for it not to, if that makes sense?"

Hahahahahahaha.  Oh ok!

Social status can be viewed through many lenses.  People of higher means and incomes tend to dress well, are more educated and can afford to put effort into their appearance by eating right and working out, much more so than lower income groups.  You may see it as men are willing to look past social standing, but you're ignoring all the things that are beneficial to a person when they are not destitute and impoverished.  "

megret,AskReddit,1391102945.0,"I [posted a few months ago] about quitting my 3 pack a day habit (http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1nfqe1/a_year_ago_today_i_was_a_3packsaday_smoker_a_year/) about quitting my 3 pack a day habit , and I'll just paste it here...

I quit through a regiment of cussing, snacking, and bribery.

That voice in your head that tells you you need to smoke is a lying sack of shit. That is not your brain talking. That is your addiction talking. Every chance you get, you tell that little shit to shut the fuck up.

Examples:

**Voice:** You’ve had a rough day! How can you be expected to quit on a day like this? You deserve a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, dummy. What I deserve is fancy-ass Digiorno pizza for dinner and two motherfucking king size Reese’s cups for dessert


**Voice:** You’ve gone three days without a cigarette! Man that’s pretty good. You know what you should do to celebrate? Pick up a pack or two on the way home!

**You:** Shut the fuck up, asshole! Are you fucking stupid? To celebrate three days of not smoking I am going to go buy a $5 drink from motherfucking Starbucks and then go ogle hotties on the street. Fuck you.

**Voice:** Wow, so five days without smoking. Today was kind of rough, huh? You should take it easy, you know? Go pick up a pack, ease into this quitting. Just step it down. It’s not like anybody knows you’re trying to quit, except one or two people. And everyone kind of expects you to just keep smoking anyway.

**You:** Shut. The Fuck. Up. Bitch almighty of the planet Dumbfuck, just shut your ignorant fucking hole.


**Voice:** Look at you! You made it a whole week without smoking! Holy shit! Can you believe it? Those assholes thought you’d never make it. You sure showed them! Boy, glad that’s over. Welp, now’s as good a time as any to go pick up a pack!

**You:** Shut the fuck up! Are you fucking stupid? This isn’t going to happen. What’s going to happen is me and my pajamas and this 2 pound bag of Jolly Ranchers and you shutting the fuck up, idiot.


**Voice:** You could just have one. No one would blame you.

**You:** I would blame me, you weak fucking sack of shit. Shut the fuck up.


**Voice:** Damn, don’t you take breaks at work any more? You just come in here, clock in, stay inside all day. Don’t you want to go outside? I’m sure you can find a co-worker to bum you a smoke.

**You:** You fucking twerp. Leave me alone. I - wait. Yeah, outside sounds fine. I’m heading out for some Starbucks. Nice try, idiot.


I also bribed myself. A bribe for each non-smoking day, each non-smoking week, each non-smoking month, and at six months, and at a year. Examples:

Every day: an app or song, or something around $1. Sometimes I’d just go into a dollar store and see what’s up.

Every week: Something around $15, a book or album (I was starting to listen to the blues and that’s kind of a hassle to get your hands on in an instant-gratification sort of way. I live in Chicago; it's pretty easy to find in a store here.)

Every month: Something around $50-60: going out for a nice dinner, a new article of clothing, a video game, whatever.

At six months: Something around $150

At one year: TBD, but it looks like I’ll be picking up a cheap little tablet.

So, when you’re struggling with falling off the wagon, when “just one” sounds like a good idea, or when “I deserve a cigarette” is pounding in your brain, just remember: you deserve better than a smoke, and that little voice is slowly trying to kill you. You're better than this, and you're gonna be fine.

**Edit** Another thing that really helped was that I'd put my milestones on Facebook, Twitter, etc. It didn't matter if it was a 3-month milestone or just some random day (""104 days of no smoking!""), the positive feedback from people I actually knew in real life was a big help, too."

- The Hubble constant and supernovae that died billions of years ago. Basically, light is the fastest thing in the universe. If we observe light from supernovae really far away and calculate how long it took it the light to get to us, we can calculate the age of the universe. I.e. the universe is only as old as how far light has moved away from us.

- Newtons law of gravitational motion. Bigger objects attract smaller ones with greater force. Also, we can observe the orbital paths of the other planets.
- That's really more of a testament to how quickly computer technology developed. But basically, most of the calculations were done before the launch, it took little processing power once it was launched.

At my previous place of employment, I was a strong performer and praised highly by my manager, but my yearly increases were 1%, on average, because the company couldn't ""afford"" raises.

I began looking casually at other opportunities.  I found one that was agreeable and when they decided to talk salary with me, I told them I'd change positions for a 20% increase in my salary plus moving expenses paid.  I expected a No - I was afraid of change and was throwing what I thought was an absurd number into the mix - instead, I got a Yes, and a When Can You Start?

Don't be afraid to ask for what you want, don't be afraid to go where you will be compensated well.

There's going to be two rings involved - an engagement ring and a wedding ring.  It's best if they go together somehow so plan ahead.  If your girlfriend is an outdoorsy type, simple is better.  The wedding rings can be simple gold bands without diamond chips or anything in them.

If you believe her about not putting a bunch of money into the engagement ring, get one with a simple diamond chip and save the rest for the honeymoon or a down payment on a house.  Otherwise, yes, the C's affect price.  I wouldn't go over a carat; my wife's diamond is 40 point (100 points to a carat).  

If you like the look of a diamond solitaire though, make sure you get extra prongs to hold the stone in place.  Consider a low profile cut or have the ring built up a bit to keep the stone from getting knocked out when she's messing with the horses."

1. Relationships shouldn't be about showing each other how much you love each other by spending money on each other. He could buy me diamond earrings and that wouldn't mean he loves me any more or less than if he doesn't buy me anything. 

2. As someone who was single most of my life, I know how badly this pseudo-holiday makes single people feel. Nothing was worse than when they'd sell Valentine's flowers as a fundraiser in high school, delivering them publicly during classes, and being one of the few girls who *never* got *any*.

3. I don't like days that make people feel ""obligated"" to do nice things for their SO. I would rather get a small, thoughtful on some random day of the year than a bouquet of roses on V Day. So we just ignore it.

There are other reasons, but these are the main three. If other people want to celebrate, then that's fine. No judgement. But my husband and I love each other every day, we don't need Valentine's Day to be a ""special"" day to do it.

Did the photographer have you sign a contract of any sort?  Did you pay them in cash or check, or a credit card?  Do you have a receipt of any kind?  If so, I'd contact your bank.  Additionally, collect all emails/documentation you may have that would prove this photographer was working for you.

There's something fishy about failure to deliver images, then taking down a website.  A true professional wouldn't dare throw out their business over one shoot, and believe me..  Delivering images isn't hard.  Perhaps he lost them/they turned out horribly and he's embarrassed, but he should know how to handle that situation.  

Do you know anyone else who has worked with this particular photographer before, or was he a random find?

plaidhat1,astrophotography,1391103248.0,"There was a report yesterday of a new potential supernova in M99.  This one is going to be a lot more difficult to capture than the recent supernova in M82, for several reasons.  First, M99 doesn't rise high enough to start imaging until some time after midnight.  Second, the potential supernova is in closer to the center of the galaxy, so you may need to experiment with exposure times.  Too short and you won't see anything.  Too long, and it may get lost in the glow of M99's core.  Third, M99 is much farther away.  Some scopes with short focal lengths may not be able to resolve the potential supernova at all.  That may change if it gets brighter, but you'll notice that it doesn't seem visible in the main image from the fast FSQ-106ED, where it looks like it may be there in the much slower (i.e. longer focal length) TOA-150.

I whipped this image together in a hurry, using what time I could get on rental scopes, in between other people's runs.  The quality is not the greatest.

Crackerjacksurgeon,CrusaderKings,1391103279.0,"A) Voluntary vassalization depends on, roughly in the order of weight:

1. Lack of kinghood (kings do not bend the knee, ever)
1. Religion (infidels do not bend the knee, ever)
1. Culture (big malus if their culture is different, but can be overcome)
1. Whether they're dejure vassal of yours (big malus if not, but can be overcome)
1. Power (Being a far larger realm gives a big bonus) 
1. Difference in rank (ie an independent count is less likely to bow to his dejure duke than to his dejure king, substitute duke, king and emperor for duke level vassalization-targets) 
1. Opinion (malus or bonus either depending on opinion)

So it all depends on what title you're pressing, what title you are, how large you are, and who the courtier is by religion/culture. 

B)

It really is just a numbers game. Vassals over a certain opinion point will not join factions unless someone intrigues them into one via their spymaster. You can murder a count's kid, then turn around and give him a duchy and he won't even be mad.

* No one else has ever had a problem with it.
* I was upsetting her.
* Per the contract, she is allowed to enter communal areas without permission (though the law itself supersedes any contract, so she doesn't really have a leg to stand on.)
* She can't give me 24 hours notice because she's arranging the viewings at such short notice (which isn't my issue to be honest, why can't she arrange her viewings days in advance instead of hours in advance?)

I always wondered why is that supposed to be some act of charity. I mean, if you subscribe to the idea that killing ""women and children"" - always put together as some homogeneous group - is worse than killing men, then that's because you find them to be helpless people who have no agency of their own (since they are assumed to be, say, not complicit in anything the husband/father did, or not a threat once you remove the men). Therefore, you are leaving them without the only thing - a man - that could have taken care of them. In that case, you're basically doing a worse thing than killing them, because you leave them to mourn the loved person while being vulnerable and helpless without them.

It's always that way in books, where you read ""armies went through the countryside, massacring whole villages, women and children included."" And if they've left them at the mercy of the first band of deserters, that would have been so compassionate?"

Kendrick Lamar is 26 and on his third major album, he's like four years into his career. In 1954 Duke Ellington was 55 years old and had been a bandleader with several major hits for at least two decades. 

I don't know enough about Lamar's career as K-Dot to gauge his tapes' influence on the genre... but to say that Macklemore should feel bad for stealing the award from Lamar, implying that Lamar is as much of a trailblazer as Duke was to Brubeck, that seems to be the major stretch. Duke Ellington was a world-reknowned legend of the Big Band era for a good 20 years and a shoo-in for the ""Mount Rushmore of Jazz"" by the time Brubeck came around. I don't think you can make the same statement about Kendrick Lamar right now, can you? I'm not saying he sucks or anything, I'm just saying he's yet to reach the prime of his career, it's not like Macklemore swiped the spotlight of, say, Nas and Jay-Z or Tupac etc.    "

Taulon,CrusaderKings,1391103918.0,"I would avoid primogeniture for two reasons. First, the crown authority requirements(high, i think, but I haven't played vanilla in over a year) will cause your vassals to hate you. Ordinarilly this wouldn't be a huge issue, but it compounds with the second issue. The second issue is that your heir will take over at about 40 years old, meaning when he does take over he will start his short reign penalty, and will very likely not live to see his long reign opinion bonus.

Overall this causes a lot of vassals who dislike you in general.

As far as BEST succession, it is widely acknowledged on this subreddit that elective is a very powerful succession for two reasons. First, you get to pick your heir, it doesn't have to be one of your children. Second, your vassals love you for it, meaning more taxes/levies, but also the higher opinion means they will almost certainly vote for your chosen candidate. As long as your vassals do not hate you or your heir they will usually vote for your chosen heir

Another very powerful succession is ultimogeniture for the same reason that primogeniture is so weak. Your youngest child inherits, meaning if he inherits very young you will end up getting your short reign penalty out of the way early and get to your long reign very early in his life. And ultimogeniture can be done at much lower crown authority(low if memory serves, but it's been a while).

Seniority is pretty bad for the same reason primogeniture is, except even worse because you guarantee that your ruler will never live to see his long reign bonus. If you switch to seniority you can expect to be stuck on it forever for 2 reasons. First you will almost never reign for 10 years since you will be playing very old men forever. Second you will have a constant short reign penalty meaning vassals will constantly want your head on a pike.

Tanistry SOUNDS good, but is actually just a worse version of elective. It sounds great because you never risk losing an election, but as the tooltip says, voters tend to favor distant relatives who are older title claimants. Still easy enough to work with though."

Diet is hard because you aren't making all your food. I too had my parents make my food until I went to University. From what I see, you can either tell your parents that you're COMMITTED to making this change. You can cook for yourself or get someone to teach you. This is not only good now but it'll be amazing later when you're on your own.

In terms of what to eat: 
It'll be a lot easier if you start to count calories. I did it for a few weeks but it took too damn long and was so tedious. I got a general idea of what I ate and how many calories were in it, then just track it in your head or on a piece of paper.
I find carbs to be my best friend. Oats and pasta. A pack of pasta has 3000 calories and isn't bad on protein and fiber either. Obviously, your diet will vary because we're different people.

We're both young. Hormones are going crazy right now, and it's a good choice you've decided to make this change as early as you did. Just remember that you aren't going to be pressing 315 in the next month. Everything takes time.

However, I had the Mirena IUD which is what I believe caused my long manic episode. It didn't start until a few months after insertion, and the six months after removal are when all of my skin/hair/weight issues began. So I think mine may be related to hormone shifts.

I have to begrudgingly concede some of your points. The wings are still an issue at times, especially since Barnes has regressed significantly this season. 

They also have no true big wing defender, and the Kevin Durants of the league will eat them alive when push comes to shove. As of now, I'm bearish on their chances of making the Finals only because of the Thunder. I do still call them a title contender because I think they are the second best team in their conference and they can make it if things fall their way. I would be ecstatic if they made it even to the final four.

You are absolutely right about the interior depth, it's without a doubt their most pressing need. The Hedo signing helps of course, but they still need a second competent backup big. I still think Lamar Odom is in play, but there's a chance that they could get someone like Emeka Okafor around the trade deadline. I definitely think Doc will address it.

The lack of experience might come into play a little, but I doubt it'll be the reason they lose. Obviously you have a championship coach in Doc, Redick has been to the Finals, and CP3 is definitely poised enough to handle that sort of environment.

I'm not that worried about the late game offense, in part because I don't think Chris Paul really ever takes a bad shot in crunch time. But they do also have a functional offense now that they have coaches who will actually call plays, and other players who are not afraid to take big shots (Redick and Crawford).

In short, this might not be their year in terms of having a shot at winning a title, but their play this season still justifies them being lumped in that same elite tier."

anatomizethat,AskReddit,1391104212.0,"I want to answer this as the child of someone who smoked, who then had smoking removed from their environment - just in case it helps with what your child might go through.

Short story is: My dad smoked almost his entire life (started at like 11 or something) and died when I was 14 (he was 58, died of cancer unrelated to smoking, though the fact he had smoked so long impaired his immune system and could be counted among the reasons his cancer was fatal). So I was used to him smoking about a pack a day my entire life.

There were certain (little) things that started to bother me, like my clothes and hair smelling like smoke. Then there were the BIG changes after my dad died. We realized the color of the walls and drapes had actually been discolored by his smoking. Breathing DID actually become easier for me, though by the time I went to college (4 years after my dad died) I had developed a really bad allergy to smoke - eyes bloodshot and on fire, lungs felt like they were burning - that was pretty bad.

Honestly, I hate the smell of smoke now. The college town I was in had a city wide ban on smoking indoors before my state did, and when the state (IL) passed a law against it I was THRILLED. I finally knew I'd be able to breathe while actually enjoying a meal.

But most of all...I just miss my dad. I know that smoking didn't kill him...but I know it's one of the reasons he didn't get better, and the recovery rate from his form of cancer is 96%. This is a total play on your emotions - but imagine you're diagnosed with something and told, ""Don't worry, your chances are good, the recovery rate is very high!"" and then you tell your child that. Man, your child will hold on to that piece of hope and *literally* will not let go until the light goes out of your eyes. Now imagine it does, and that child is left fatherless because you turned out to be in that 4%. Well...it's coming up on 12 years and I'm sitting in that boat. Not a day goes by that I don't think about my dad, or think about some part of my life that he's going to miss out on. He won't walk me down the aisle (or ever know my husband), he won't meet his grandchildren, he won't get to enjoy retirement with his wife. Fuck it, I don't even know how my mom got through his dying, and I know she still misses him. He was the love of her life.

It scares me that you think there is no physical impact on you. My dad passed all of his respiratory tests just fine, but [there is science to prove that smoking damages your immune system](http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/library/reports/tobaccosmoke/factsheet.html). And when your body is being attacked by chemo drugs to get rid of cancer, it needs every bit of strength to bounce back. Smoking inhibits that. You don't see it now, but one day you might, and it could be too late to quit. It was for my dad - because in the end smoking was the only real comfort he had. I mean, he was dying anyways, there was no reason to quit.

I didn't mean for this to be so long and emotional. I hate smoking, and for obvious reasons. It's going to effect your child, regardless of how aware you are of those effects. I just don't want you to think that you've gotten off without any side effects, because there's a very good chance you haven't.

And mostly, I just don't want other kids to go through what I did. It really sucks to bury your parent before you've even started high school."

It would taint the perception of that individual alone.  

&gt;That doesn't fill me with confidence in your ability to use a gun appropriately.  

I don't conceal carry, but at the same time this is the same advice you would get from a cop friend if you had one.  The point is that if you are attacked and you have to use deadly force to defend yourself you don't leave them alive.  Then you open the door to a lawsuit from your assailant in civil court as well as allowing a scumbag thug to continue to threaten others.  Essentially cut through all the bullshit red tape.  Also, when talking someone away from planning on setting up an execution if they are attacked is just giving good advice on how to not have the police suspect you are a crazed killer.  Any self defense expert would tell you to empty your mag as well unless there are multiple assailants.

&gt;However, according to B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, ""The expropriation procedure used in Ma'ale Adummim is unprecedented in the settlement enterprise. Expropriation of land for settlement purposes is forbidden, not only under international law but also according to the long-standing, official position of Israeli governments. Most settlements were built on area that was declared state land or on land that was requisitioned - ostensibly temporarily - for military purposes. It appears that in Ma'ale Adummim, the government decided to permanently expropriate the land because it viewed the area as an integral part of Jerusalem that would forever remain under Israeli control.""

In the past, Chechens would identify as something like ""X son of X of X clan from X place "" When Chechens were ordered by the Soviet government to get last names, the living patriarch of each family chose the name of the 7th forefather as his last name. The reason it was the 7th forefather is because traditionally you were considered a Chechen only if your family had lived there for at least 7 generations. The same rule applies to your place of origin; let's say your family hails from town/city/village X but you were born and raised in Y, when someone asks you where you are from you would reply ""from X.""

If they're genuinely interested, they'll also have little or no qualms about being alone with you. If you suggest a change of setting or venue (taking a walk, checking out another bar, etc) and she is happy to come right along, then guess what? That means she wants to be alone with you.

I've also noticed that some women unintentionally ""fondle"" things if they're turned on by you. Like a straw, keychain, or whatever slightly phallic object is within reach.

The lack of sleep thats brought on by depression or low moments in life tends to cause things to plummet further, sort of fogs the mind up. A week of good sleep can make the world of a difference, might just clear the fog up and help them see its not so bad.

Going on the waiting list and then seeking free help from one of the many organizations that offer it is really the best thing you can do, that or pay out of pocket to get tested. 


In regards to the culture thing I don't think the issue is in a lack of sensitivity but a culture of over sensitivity, people go through rough patches and assume they have depression or some other mental illness. Everyone assumes the worst and figuring out whether the cause of the tendencies is environmental or internal is important, thats really difficult when you have genuine sufferers mixed in with over dramatic and hormonal teenagers.

lordfuzzywig,battlefield_4,1391104550.0,"...No. The AK-47 was created to combat the first AR the world had ever seen, the German StG 44. The StG 44 was so overwhelmingly powerful and versatile that countries HAD to adapt. No longer could they bring carbines and LMGs and expect to be competitive. A new generation of weapons had to be created. The AK-47 was one of the first ones created to combat the StG 44.

&gt;the ak-47 [...] should be a pdw too

No. It shouldn't. It is an assault rifle, and meets every characteristic of an assault rifle. It does not meet any -- not even most -- of the characteristics of a PDW. And I'm speaking about reality, not just in-game.

&gt;a pdw is a gun that uses compact armor piercing bullets like the mp7, p90 or fn57.

The FN57 is only ""considered"" a PDW because of the special round it uses. PDWs in general are SMGs or SBRs -- very compact weapons with high muzzle velocity.

The Uzi, the PDR, the Vektor and other similar pistol-to-SBR converters like the Kriss, the MP7 and P90 as you have said, the MARS, KACPDW, MINSAS -- look at all of those and what they have in common.

They're all small -- the KACPDW is 18 inches folded, the MPPDR is 19 inches, the PP2000 is 14 inches, the P90 is 20 inches. The AK-47 is 26 inches **folded**. They're all fully-automatic, or have the ability to be, and they all use special rounds slightly smaller than rifle rounds but slightly larger than pistol rounds. Basically, they're all SMGs.

PDWs were designed for units that were not front-line combat troops to defend themselves in ambushes. Nothing more, nothing less. As a result, they needed to be compact and needed to be able to defeat enemy body armour if present. The AK-47 is the antithesis of a PDW.

You may be speaking of the AKS-74U, which was the shortened version of the AK-47. That, however, is indeed a PDW and an entirely different gun."

My mind would be blown if you could actually have full access to all of those functions at the same time, while still having the ability to use the sticks and hats for your 6 degrees of freedom.

I think you're misreading it and that there are 300 possible functions (as in things that could be done with those buttons) and that if you take one 8-way hat, it's 8 buttons. And that stacking up the possibilities you could gain access to many functions at once, but  you're not going to get to use it all together."

I'm really in the bag for Obama, but he can't do much with a Republican House of Representatives and a possible Senate Republican fillibuster.

Take plenty of deodorant and clothes that are good for humidity and rain. 

If you want to travel to different cities, look into the JR pass options available. They have some specifically for foreigners that give you a big discount. The JR website has a lot of info on how to buy tickets and stuff--reading the tips will save you a lot of headache when you are there.

Have a way to access cash when you are there because a lot of places don't accept credit card. Citibank has a fair number of branches there, but I don't know what kind of setup process you need to undergo to be able to get withdraw from a foreign account.

Go to the food halls in the bottom floors of department stores. There's lots of food, from affordable to very pricey. Just note it is not socially acceptable to eat it there. It's to take home. Department stores are also a great place to cool off for free in the summer. 

These are some good websites:

http://www.japan-guide.com/

http://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/

https://online.jtbusa.com/Tour.aspx
(Nothing wrong with going on some tours)

Domestic travel is really expensive, so make sure to account for that. You can easily blow a couple hundred dollars going anywhere by bullet train. So you have to decide whether it more important to you to see lots of cities, or to eat well and buy stuff? If you just stay in Tokyo, for instance, there is plenty to see and do in one month. You can take day/weekend trips to Nagano, Enoshima, Kamakura, Izu, Hakone, Yokohama, etc. Within Nagano there is Nikko, Matsumoto, and the Jigokudani monkey park, amongst others. (I don't know if there are many monkeys visible in the summer; you should check...but I went in the fall and it was the most beautiful place I've ever been.) 

Or if you stay in Kansai, you can explore Kyoto, Osaka, Nara and the rest of the area without blowing a lot on domestic travel. Kyoto is more traditional whereas Osaka is more urban, like Tokyo. 

Definitely look into what matsuri are going on. There is one basically every weekend in the summer if you know where to look. It's free entertainment, cheap food and a great vibe."

I have about 6 friends that live within 4 blocks of me, and many more within walking distance.  There's always something to do or someplace I can be.

The general public keeps to themselves and hardly anyone I encounter is uptight.  Being in other cities on vacation, I've been extremely put off by a lot of people who approach me rather aggressively, ""So, what's the story with your outfit?""  Shit, man.

2 weeks ago, you were using RES v4.3.1.2

&gt; I'm not disagreeing with you, but that hasn't been my experience. This problem has cropped up only in the last week or so. 

in the last week 'til today, you're using RES v4.3.1.2

if you're double checking that, good... the version numbers do indeed match and that's not a typo... the point I'm illustrating is that RES hasn't changed, something else has.

So your first inclination shouldn't be that there's a bug in RES, most likely...

&gt; Before that, I could keep the same reddit tab open all day without ever refreshing and just keep going...I thought that was the whole point of never ending reddit?

For the most part, yes... but Reddit doesn't have a notion of ""pages""... if you disable RES, you'll see that the ""next"" button doesn't lead to a url like ?page=2... it leads to something like ?after=t3_ajwjafdh

that means ""show me stuff after the post with ID 'ajwjafdh'""...

let's say that post gets removed... or it gets reshuffled in the priority because of upvotes, downvotes, etc... that's going to mess up the ""next"" button -- with or without RES.

all RES does is save you the trouble of clicking the ""next"" button and load stuff into the current page.  it can't fix server side behavior, unfortunately."

Wulftastic,soccer,1391105066.0,"Personally I believe Tottenham are a big club, we always have been. We should be in and around the Top 6 regardless and this should not be seen as exceeding expectations. Now for the past 7 years Spurs have been on the cusp of truly breaking into the top 4 on a permanent basis, the squad was assembled and had good coaches and managers but needed a little extra something, a couple of star quality players. Levy in the transfer windows failed to back our managers in what I see as crucial january transfer windows. 2011-12, we are 3rd place and have a unique opportunity as Arsenal/Chelsea/Liverpool are all out of sorts. We needed to bring in a defender and a striker, we had just sold Pav/Crouch and King was hardly playing more than a game every other week and Gallas was defensively suspect. What did we do while sitting in 3rd?! Brought in Louis Saha and Ryan Nelson. Quality. Now this can also be down to mismanagement by Redknapp running our first team into the ground but we collapsed and let a 10 point gap disappear over Arsenal. We should have invested in 2 missing pieces that could have put us in genuine title contention (the press were saying we were contenders). 

Last summer, Modric left, VdV left, we have lost our two most creative players! We needed a playmaker role player, we had plenty of cash from a number of sales that window and in all the ones previously and AVB had stated on numerous occasions that Moutinho was a player he admired. Some people claim that we tried to get a deal done in the last day of the window but 3rd party ownership meant we couldn't complete it in time, well we shouldn't have been doing it in the last hours! That season we lumbered along being rescued in games by Bale's wondergoals where our opponents would sit defensively and park the bus, we couldn't break them down because we didn't have any playmaker! And last season was another huge chance to permanently break ahead of Arsenal as they had their weakest squad in years yet they still beat us! AVB had part of the blame as his tactics relied too much on Bale but Levy also didn't bring in the players we needed!

Oh and one last thing, for the past 5 years we have been planning to build a new stadium yet because we haven't been in the top 4 we have found getting a naming sponsorship difficult which means we also can't even begin to make any real progress in its construction apart from simply breaking ground on the construction site next to WHL.

So what helped me quit? After the 3rd time of really trying and not just a ""maybe I'll have just one instead of two on my break"", I saw a doctor and got a prescription for an inhaler that looked like a tampon.

This helped in two ways. First the stupid thing looked like a tampon. Who in their right mind would be in public with one of those things next to their mouth? My hand would be the last to raise. It was humiliating which was helpful because I chose my times to use it carefully. 

The second way is the nicotine. I think I had the 3 mg nicotine (I could be wrong, it was a while ago) inhaler which was *very* strong. Just a few drags and I was high as a kite. It also burned the sh!t out of my throat so it gave me the same sensation of a real smoke.

I told all of my friends I quit smoking too, this is very important. Not that I was trying to quit...nooo...I quit. This is more a testament to your own will power than anything. You really, really, really have to want it. Don't half ass this. As someone famous once said, ""Smoking is just a classy way of committing suicide.""

One of my big sticking points is his domestic policy, specifically the ACA and jobs. Overlooking the constitutionality of the act arguments, I think he put the cart before the horse on this. The big thing is that individual mandate exists so the poor insurance companies don't feel put out by having to insure scores of people on the cheap -- but those scores of people wouldn't exist if he had worked to fix the unemployment situation. More people covered under employer plans = less on the exchange, less subsidies needed to be handed out, etc.  I think at the end of the day the ACA is going to end up destroying the middle class. "

Obviously not all short guys are like this, I have dated guys that are 5'3 in the past and dont have issues with over-compensating, blah blah blah. Whatever whatever.

A bully is being mean because he wants to be mean. Because he gets some sort of joy out of making you cry and feel bad. Schadenfreude is his essence.

An asshole is just somebody who doesn't care about anybody else and naturally behaves in a way that isn't considerate and is bad for other people -- or, uses language that conveys such emotions, or something like that. You can't necessarily reason with an asshole, but at least he has a reason for behaving the way he does other than making you feel bad."

As your realm grows the amount of demesne troops you have is negligible. Once you have grown to a certain point you should never have to raise your own demesne troops unless there are dire circumstances. Likewise, the extra taxes from stewardship becomes a drop in the bucket since vassal taxes make up most of your income later.

For large realms Diplomacy is far and away the most beneficial. Higher state diplomacy means everyone in the world likes you more. Higher vassal relations means fewer rebellions, more levies and more taxes.

Intrigue is not really that great. It is harder to plot against you, sure. But it's hard to plot against a grey eminence anyway because of the massive diplomacy.

**Do not rest more than 1 minute between sets**. It doesn't mention that in the article, but that's what Gironda told his trainees. You should be aiming for 15-30 second rest periods, but that will take several weeks to work up to since your current routine is so low intensity.

&gt; Week 1: One set of each exercise, six days a week.

So many of my insecurities about my previous relationship with an ISTP were hugely alleviated by understanding his type. It was amazing how a lot of the typical ISTP stuff (looks like you forgot to call me after you did X thing. Oh, you didn't answer my text... ever? I'll just call you.... until you pick up the phone because I know that you're not busy right now. Or, when he said ""I don't EVER want to have kids for right now because I don't know what the future will be like."" Which is a very different stance from ""I don't ever want to have kids period the end."") didn't bother me so much anymore, and I figured out ways to compromise and work around those things. Or clarify those things to figure out what was an absolute and what only sounded like an absolute because it was really just meant as ""in the moment"". But at the same time, I desperately tried to get him into the MBTI stuff so that he could understand himself better, as well as me. Because it had helped me so much to understand him. Unfortunately, he didn't, and that was okay.

It wasn't a problem until he started ""backsliding"" into aloofness, and the argument became ""how much time do I *have* to spend with you for you to feel happy?"" vs. ""Why would you drive an hour to only stay for four hours and not stay the night?"" And it became that way several times. I had never felt so unimportant, and I desperately tried to talk to him about it, knowing how ISTPs do things. But he stopped trying to meet me halfway. Whatever had been halfway at the time became the new ""all the way"" and the new ""halfway"" ended up being less and less and less from the original starting point. I just couldn't do it anymore.

But it's the same kind of thing you get with any relationship - you both have to compromise some. There are a lot of people that don't understand that, and end up inadvertently taking advantage of the other person. I don't know that ISTPs as a whole are less likely than other types to compromise in relationships, but I'd like to think they're the same likeliness as other types."

portugalthephilosoph,AskReddit,1391105947.0,"That is an excellent rebuttal. I think I would have to side with you regarding higher consciousness. I've been skeptical of it for a long time (hence the quotes on the phrase above), but I didn't want to ignore it for the argument's sake. 

You make several great points re: imagination. Drugs are, at times, a crutch and an excuse for escaping reality. And I think that is the biggest problem we have with youth drug use today--they are escaping a reality that they either do not want or are not capable of facing.

But what if drugs are used as a tool? For instance, a writer who is suffering from writer's block smokes some marijuana and then comes up with an incredible idea for the continuation of the story. Are there other ways to overcome the writer's block? In all likelihood, yes. Will any be as effective and immediate as the drug he chose? Probably not. Imagination is still a prerequisite, but the THC psychoactive effect enhanced it beyond normal human capacity.

Immersion is an interesting concept, and I think that drugs do cause an immersion into an alternate reality--or, more precisely, an *altered* reality. Because you are still living in actual reality, the decisions you make still have consequences. Yet, the reality that you perceive can be quite different from what it really *is*. Still, you (usually) KNOW that this perceived reality is false. However, it is still giving you a different perspective on actual reality. You are seeing it from the outside-in, devoid of any attachment to that reality. This allows one to see things in a bigger-picture sense. Or maybe I'm just blowing this all out of my ass.

For relativists and skeptics who believe that reality only exists in the mind of man, then any alteration to the way the mind functions (i.e., drugs) would *actually* change reality. I despise this view of reality as intensely irrational, but for arguments sake it works.

When I started to get a craving I would imagine taking a drag off a cigarette and then imagine different scenarios of my demise... inside of my lungs would become instantly coated in tar and I would be unable to exchange oxygen despite gasping. Or all the blood vessels in my lungs would suddenly explode and I would die bubbling blood. Or both my lungs would suddenly collapse. Anything really dramatic and awful- having that great imagination comes in here. And then that would make me anxious, and I began to associate smoking with crushing anxiety. So I no longer wanted to smoke.

However the campaign blew up and they made made millions more, and it just kept going up to the point where they said ""to hell with it, we'll have the community be our funding and they can help with the decisions.""

So even though right now they're closing on on $40 million of crowd funded money, they originally asked for 20 times less than that, and just wanted to see if they could find a fan base to make the game they wanted to build."

We had a cat, Indy, that disappeared during the course of a move.  After six  months or so we had given up on seeing him again (checking the old neighborhood n' stuff).  He was an older cat and by this point we were pretty sure he... well, he wouldn't be returning.  Anyway, one day my five year old asked about our cat.  He was crying and I couldn't bring myself to tell him that I thought Indy was gone for good.  I made up a really huge lie. 

We live in a port town.  I told my son I had recently gotten a call from our cat and he was in China.  He had always wanted to see the world and one day he decided it was time to do it.  He went to ships and (through pantomime, as he didn't speak human) offered to catch mice in exchange for passage wherever they were going.  Now he was traveling all over the world, hopping on boats here and there, and having an amazing time.  Indy would be back some day but, as he couldn't read, he never knew where he was going.  Also though, he wasn't in any rush to get back as there was still a lot of world to see.  I told my son that Indy said he missed us and loved us and someday would come back with all sorts of stories about his adventures in the wide, wide world. 

Later, my son would ask about Indy and I would tell him stories about Indy's adventures in far off places.  This went on for around six months, requests for stories coming further and further apart before they stopped.  

When my son was seven he asked about Indy and the stories I had told him.  I told him the truth about Indy and the stories. We both cried a little. Then he hugged me and smiled.  He said he understood why I had lied to him about Indy- because I love him and didn't want to see him hurt.  Sweet kid.  Ugh... remembering that still makes me tear up!"

And the synagogue was defaced with swastikas probably twice (along with other property damage) the six years I went to services there.

I hadn't really realized it was that bad, because we were involved with reform congregations before that in nicer parts of town. Stuff had happened in the past, but it was like an urban legend -- you heard about it, but you didn't see it happening to you.

Yeah. So being super Jewish in the midst of a fairly Republican city in a bad part of town? Get ready for the antisemitism. And the internet is a breeding ground for conspiracy bullshit."

YellowOrbitz,relationships,1391106090.0,"&gt; I knew immediately what she meant by that and at first ignored the comment but I couldn't help it. It was a cheap shot and totally uncalled for. I told her that there was no reason for her to behave this way and she accused me of speaking to Hipsterina all day every day behind her back. I have nothing to hide so I willingly give up my phone and email and passwords but now she says it doesn't matter because I've been using her media player to send her messages. So I hold out the media player for her to show me these alleged messages but she refuses to take it. At this point my roommate opens the door to ask if everything was alright, I turned to face him when I felt a push from behind and then the feeling of a fist against my back. She called me stupid and I left her in my room to cool down with my roommate.

Just because you *say* you're trying doesn't mean you are. Actions speak louder than words and it's very clear that OP's girlfriend would much rather make him too miserable to contact this girl than outright say she's not okay with it. This way she can claim that she's ""not forcing"" him to do anything while successfully getting him to stop talking to his friend. 

Also, where you getting this whole ""pouting, seething and ignoring"" thing from? You're just pulling that out of your ass. 

Personally though him asking her to stop talking to a guy *who is actively hitting on her and talking shit about him* is different than a friend who is respectful of their relationship. I can still understand why someone would be uncomfortable with Hipterina given their past, but the fact that then OP is just suppose to be okay with his girlfriend talking shit about him to a guy who's actively trying to get into her pants is hypocritical. 

Plus she *hit* him. That is **NOT** communicating her insecurities humorously! "

I think the best way to find these additional features to add is simply to think about what you use the software for, then take the hardest part of that, and then think about a tool to do that for you.

Creating tools that do the same thing as competitors, but in a better way, is also something we need to work on. It's like how you use Git in a completely different way to the tools that came before it, simply because the way it works enables you to do things in a better way."

wordserious,explainlikeimfive,1391106286.0,"I believe that this comes from the erroneous equating of intelligence and knowledge. A lot of people, most of them really, believe that ""being smart"" is the same as ""knowing things.""

It should be obvious that it is at least impolite pointing out when people are less than intelligent. This is because there is not much that the person can do to change it. Criticizing someone because they are not very smart is not different than criticizing them because they are not very tall. It is not their fault.

Now, when you correct someone's grammar, because of the association of knowledge and intelligence, people assume you are criticizing their intelligence, when in fact you are just pointing out a simply correctable mistake.

It is smart to want to learn from your mistakes, which is why you appreciate being corrected, as do I. Most people, however, don't realize that they are not being criticized.

TL;DR: people confuse intelligence with knowledge, when you try to give them some knowledge they assume you're calling them dumb."

What I'd say about philosophy, though, is that you certainly can find answers to these questions. If by 'definitive' you mean 'no one can find a way to object', well...you can throw out physics too under that definition :) But if you mean 'most will agree if provided the argument', then yeah, you can find a lot of answers.

Now, many of them may be negative answers. ""What is the right action in this case"", and an answer you might find may be ""Well, not *this*"", and people will agree. ""I don't know if there is *only one* correct action to take, but I do know that it isn't *that action*.""

The thing is--that's most of life. 'Definitively solvable problems' are a small, small minority of the human experience. Doing taxes, maybe. But not even 'building a house', where you will find a lot of disagreement among engineers, builders, architects, etc, and no definitive way to settle the disagreement that all will agree with. Certainly not, then, for issues like ""should the Superbowl be played in cold weather outside"", or ""should we help Syrian rebels if they are fighting alongside extremists"", or ""should we honor the last wishes of the woman who has passed into a coma but is pregnant"", or etc etc.

SerPuissance,pics,1391106462.0,"It's likely to do with the size of bridges that canal builders were able to build using stone cheaply - there are many big old stone bridges over rivers here but they were massive engineering projects in their day and were essential for land trade routes. Narrower canals also allowed for easier building of tunnels, which there are many of along British along canals. 

Before steam and diesel engines,  [Draught Horses] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_horse) often referred to as Shire Horses, were used to pull narrow barges along the canals. The crew would fend the boat off the banks as the horse was pulling. When they reached a tunnel, the crew would lie on their backs and ""walk"" the boat through the tunel using their legs on the low tunnel roof while the horse was led over the top of whatever the tunnel was going beneath. These ""towpaths"" became obsolete with the introduction of fossil fuel power.

In many areas where the waterway was broad enough to allow for the tacking and reaching of sailing boats which change with wind conditions, small craft such as [Wherry's] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wherry) and [Trows] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trow) moved about without the need for horses. These can still be seen today on large revers like the Trent and in wetlands like the [Norfolk Broads.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Broads)  

As an interesting side note, AFAIK most early roads in Britain were wide enough to accomodate roughly two horses/carts. Like the canals, this resulted in narrow bridges and tunnels. This standard road gauge was incorporated into our railways too, which is why British tanks weren't very good against German tanks during most of WW2. Simply put, we couldn't fit tanks with big turrets mounting big calibre guns because they had to be transported on railways through narrow tunnels because of horse's butts!!"

Khatib,battlefield_4,1391106518.0,"[TIL: we're both wrong.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow-point_bullet#Legality)

&gt;The Hague Convention of 1899, Declaration III, prohibited the use in *international warfare* of bullets that easily expand or flatten in the body.[3] This is often incorrectly believed to be prohibited in the Geneva Conventions, but it significantly predates those conventions, and is in fact a continuance of the St. Petersburg Declaration of 1868, which banned exploding projectiles of less than 400 grams, as well as weapons designed to aggravate injured soldiers or make their death inevitable.  
&gt;Despite the ban on military use, hollow-point bullets are one of the most common types of bullets used by civilians and police,[4] which is due largely to the reduced risk of bystanders being hit by over-penetrating or ricocheted bullets, and the increased speed of incapacitation."

Some of my favorite moments in the series are when Martin reminds us of this, like in AFFC when Brienne, Pod, and Hyle Hunt are traveling the riverlands with Septon Meribald. Meribald has a fantastic monologue about conscripted peasant soldiers which I'll quote.

&gt;""Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day some lord came round to take them off to war. Poorly shod and poorly clad, they march away beneath his banners, ofttimes with no better arms than a sickle or a sharpened hoe, or a maul they made themselves by lashing a stone to a stick with strips of hide. Brothers march with brothers, sons with fathers, friends with friends. They’ve heard the songs and stories, so they go off with eager hearts, dreaming of the wonders they will see, of the wealth and glory they will win. War seems a fine adventure, the greatest most of them will ever know.""

&gt;“Then they get a taste of battle.""

...

&gt;The quiet stretched and stretched, until finally she said, “How old were you when they marched you off to war?”

&gt;“Why, no older than your boy,” Meribald replied. “Too young for such, in truth, but my brothers were all going, and I would not be left behind. Willam said I could be his squire, though Will was no knight, only a potboy armed with a kitchen knife he’d stolen from the inn. He died upon the Stepstones, and never struck a blow. It was fever did for him, and for my brother Robin. Owen died from a mace that split his head apart, and his friend Jon Pox was hanged for rape.”

&gt;“The War of the Ninepenny Kings?” asked Hyle Hunt.

&gt;“So they called it, though I never saw a king, nor earned a penny. It was a war, though. That it was.”

Illivah,funny,1391106751.0,"We shouldn't fine actual people, as sometimes they literally CAN'T pay it. That money they get from their job goes toward their home, their food, their children, and so forth. If we were to fine them as a percentage of their gross profits it would be ridiculously low quite often. But right now it's more often just arbitrary quantities, and once in a while it's ""determined"" (by people who don't know math or their expenses) what is reasonable as a fine. And that's determined via gross REVENUE from their work, not profits.

The idea that you're protecting their workers jobs is on the level of protecting the local businesses by not fining the people who live in the city."

But his works have finally gone super famous and I'm sure he's rolling the dough now, whereas before it might have just been a moderate income, so I really am glad the old guy is enjoying himself with it.

When I see articles where he's visiting New Zealand's Hobbit tourist attractions and such, it makes me really happy that the old man is experiencing life before he does pass (which hopefully will be many, many years from now).

somebodythatiusedtob,drumcorps,1391106993.0,"Unfortunately, the mix can sometimes depend on the venue and the acoustics. Thankfully, more and more corps are moving towards a system in which they use an iPad to control the sound from the stands. This way no matter what we can have a more accurate mix instead of attempting to know the crowd acoustics from down below at the mixer itself. This can also play a huge factor in where you sit. If you sit close to the 30 or wherever a corps puts their speakers, your sound will unfortunately be bass heavy, especially if the subwoofers are beefy.

That said I think the speed in which we can get information (often times wrong or bias information depending on the source) has increased the ferver in which young people judge their own intelligence. I also think people our age have a disconnect between current events and historical context that skews their understanding of information.

But either way I'm pretty sure most people around this age think they're the end all be all when it comes to intelligence. I've also heard older people say ""Oh I used to think I knew everything at that age"". I hear it gets worse in your 30's but then after that you start to gain a little perspective. "

pizzaandburritos,japan,1391107032.0,"That is not the point of the article. Of course it is common sense not to approach debate in an accusatory way and not to bring up contentious subjects with colleagues or mere acquaintances. What it is saying is that even in situations where say, in America, it would be normal to discuss difficult topics, it is not normal in Japan. 

Furthermore, what is considered a ""difficult"" topic is very different in Japan. So even with a friend you've known for some time, if you are out getting drinks and try to discuss Abenomics, for instance, or even something nonpolitical like differences between American and Japanese values, there is a good chance he will be uncomfortable discussing the topic. 

Lastly, there is a good chance that even if the topic itself is not the problem, the two of you will miscommunicate because the way you discuss things is different. 

People say Japan is a non-confrontational culture. What this article is saying is that it's not just about that. Japan is a *pro-consensus* culture. In America it is normal to politely state a differing opinion. People can disagree and, as long as everyone is civil and respectful of everyone else's opinions, all is well. In Japan, it is far less normal to just disagree with someone, however politely, even on simple matters. They will ""disagree"" by agreeing hesitantly. Japanese people know how to spot this, while Americans often take it at face value as an agreement.

Think about how much people say ""ne"" at the end of their sentences. The culture is one of affirming what your partner is saying. It's also a culture of saying things that can be easily agreed upon. That's why small talk about the weather plays such a big role in interactions. Everyone can agree. Stating opinions is not as common as in American culture. Some people are uncomfortable with being asked to state theirs. For example, in Japanese it is very common not to finish your sentence so as to avoid being unnecessarily definitive. The other person is supposed to understand the implication of what you were saying. So the article is not saying so much that Japanese frown on disagreement; the point is that they really strive for agreement, at least at the surface level. "

jerrysburner,WTF,1391107109.0,"Great point but it goes even further than that. All of those dump trucks that we have up north have to maintained constantly, costing even more money. You can't just buy the equipment and stash it away till you need it then pull it out and expect it to work. Every piece of machinery we use for road maintenance has to get pulled out before snow season if it wasn't in use during the summer (dump trucks are usually used year round) and serviced. So there's yet an additional cost - you need to have people on staff that know how to service and ready the equipment.

Add to this that many people probably don't have the proper tires on their cars for weather like this. Couple that with inexperience in these conditions and it's even worse. Tack that on to driving conditions that are already some of the slowest and most miserable in the country and you're primed for disaster. Then just for shits and giggles, force everyone out on to the roads at the exact same time by closing all schools and businesses at the same time. Now you have a situation that even in the best weather the infrastructure isn't capable of handling.

Now, I've read in several places that a lot of it turned right to ice - it doesn't matter where you are, vehicles don't do well on ice. if you have Q-rated tires with studs you'll do better than average, but I would bet my life that nobody that far south has Q-rated tires, let along, ones with studs.

They should have closed all the schools in the morning forcing a majority of the parents to stay home, removing a significant amount of traffic right off the bat.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391107171.0,"I believe in ""do what you want, as long as you don't harm others."" This leads me to believe in a high amount of personal freedom, but I do come down much harder on economics. And this is because in order to ensure maximum freedom for all, you NEED to come down harder on economics. If you have no laws and let the markets do whatever you want, you more or less become a slave. You spend most of your time working, and have pay so low you can barely live. I find this unacceptable. To achieve better results for the people, we need to place limits on peoples' economic freedom. I think we can agree that no one should have the freedom to exploit others or enforce your will on others. But when you're at the mercy of another for your very sustenance, power relationships can quickly turn into the more dominant party forcing its will on the more submissive party. It turns into the freedom of some, to oppress others.

I know it sounds counterintuitive, but in order to maximize freedom, you must give up some freedoms so that you may more fully enjoy the rest."

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391107188.0,"&gt; There should be room for the dominants of the sexes to learn dominance, and the submissives to be themselves without fear of disdain or reproach. It doesn't make sense to either create a palatable environment for one group of people or a palatable environment for another, because the same problems would come up again.

I agree with this.

However, I think a point of contention in trp comes from the fact that as more women enter the workforce and demand greater pay relative to men, men lose power. A lot of submissive women who choose that traditional lifestyle also lose power and options.

It's a simple matter of economics. The labour force ballooned with the introduction of women to the force, many of them feel like this is what has caused wages to stagnate. And as women's wages rise, men get less. Not just because women are ""taking our jobs!"" but because of the spending power and the consumption of these women is inflating costs, which drives men's relative income down further.

This forces women out of the traditional housewife role and into the workforce for many couples, even if she doesn't want to, because one man working to support an entire family is not enough anymore, especially when he's competing against so many more single people without families to support. This is  rise of dual income households. The economy reacts to this even further, e.g. corporations raise prices even more expecting people to be able to afford it because households are dual income. It's just a big spiral.

It is an economic force pressuring a lot of women, even ones who don't want that kind of life, into the workforce. This is also why some women opposed feminism. There's economic conflict of interests.

NOTE: This is not ""wrong"" per se, and I am fundamentally aligned with people being given the opportunity to work, whatever. I just feel the above perspective needed to be said, because decisions, even ethical ones, always have consequences. It's not simply a matter of ethics that people don't give ""room"" for people to be dominant or submissive. There is just limited room available at any given time. Everyone is vying for more space of their own.
 
I initially was even unsympathetic, because ""fuck you i got mine"" and ""It doesn't affect me because I make enough and have enough and all of this only works in my favour."" Took me a while to find my empathy on this matter.

A more pressing concern IMO is that people/cultures have not kept up with technology and economy. E.g. A lot of people are still dreaming of that 50's lifestyle when so much has changed. Nice big home/flat, a car, etc. 

EDIT: In case it wasn't clear enough, I am explaining a perspective. Obviously there are other factors contributing to our current economic situation. I chose to present this one specific angle that gets focused on from many conservative groups as it relates to feminism. I felt it was more relevant."

tattedspyder,AskReddit,1391107268.0,"Exactly, everyone seems to be jumping on the e-cig band wagon, but that's not *quitting* smoking, just changing how you're putting crap into your body.  Sure, you're not getting a lot of the other stuff that cigarettes put into you, but you're still dosing yourself and not actually breaking any kind of habit.  The motions are still there, the oral fixation, the addiction itself.

I smoked for 17 years and quit cold turkey about a year and a half ago.  For me what finally worked was really, truly making the decision that I was going to quit.

There's a few things that I realized that really helped me.

1. Remember that you don't want to smoke but can't, you *can* smoke, but don't *want* to.

2. **Every** positive thought you have about smoking is the addiction *lying* to you.  Those thoughts aren't yours, they belong to the addiction and they're bullshit.

3. Don't tell anyone that you're quitting.  Studies have shown that telling someone you're going to do something gives you the same chemical rush as actually doing it.  Keep it to yourself, it'll also keep the pressure off because you don't face the possibility of telling someone you failed (if you do).

4. Don't count days.  It just adds to the pressure.  It's like being on deployment or waiting for the work day to end.  If you stare at the clock and count days it drags on forever.  Counting is also a *constant* reminder that you're not smoking.

5. Don't destroy all your cigarettes right away, keep a couple around.  If you have a couple of smokes then it reinforces the ""I can, but don't want to"" idea instead of the ""I want to, but can't"".  Once you feel like you've truly put it behind you and stop getting the strong urges you can go ahead and throw them away.

6. Make your last cigarette the one before bed.  That way you already have about 8 hours of not smoking.  The physical addiction is supposedly gone within about 3 days so knocking 8 hours out of that 72 is pretty good.

7. Try to have a couple of days where you aren't going to do anything.  Aim for a weekend and don't make plans to go out.  That way you don't have a lot of the usual stimuli that make you want to smoke.  No breaks from work, no going out drinking, no hanging out with your smoker friends.  Hang out at home and catch up on your Netflix and Reddit.

8. When you would normally step outside for a smoke, go ahead and step outside, just chew gum or something instead of lighting up.  This was one of the biggest ones for me.  The habit of smoking isn't just about the cigarette or the nicotine, it's about *all* of the motions associated with that.  It's the break from work, the pause between movies, the break in the video game, stepping outside, turning your brain off for 5 minutes, shooting the shit with some friends.  Don't eliminate *any* of that **except the cigarette**.  If you followed #7 then most of that stuff should be at a minimum anyway so just step outside and chew a piece of gum for a couple minutes the way you'd normally step outside for a smoke when you're at home.

9.  You're going to have a *lot* of nervous, tense energy.  Start walking, working out, running, whatever you need to burn off some energy.  I walked for miles.  Just a pack of gum in my pocket.

10. The thought that ""I've gone X amount of hours without a smoke, I deserve a cig as a reward"" **will** occur to you and, as I said in #2, it's *bullshit*.

11. Quitting is a long process; you're going to get urges, cravings, and thoughts about smoking for a *long damned time*.  It's been a year and a half and I *still* have the occasional, ""I wouldn't mind a smoke"" thoughts.  They get easier and easier to ignore, stay strong.

12. You'll only have successfully **quit** when you die, until then you just stopped.

This is all the basic stuff that I realized and that helped me qu- *stop* smoking.  It wasn't easy, but it wasn't ridiculously hard either.  It's all about getting the right mind set."

soafraidofbees,AskReddit,1391107291.0,"My dad smoked 2 packs a day for 30 years. He never even tried to quit. When he was in his mid 40s, he went in for a routine physical and mentioned offhand to his doctor that he'd noticed his fingernails looking weird lately. What he had was ""clubbing"" of the fingernails, which is an early sign of lung cancer. His doctor ordered a chest x-ray and confirmed he had it. That day my dad threw his cigarettes away and never smoked another. He had an iron will and never slipped. But by then it was too late.

He endured surgery to remove an entire lobe of his lung. While recovering from that he had to sleep propped up with pillows on our couch because if he lay flat, his lungs might fill with fluid. They were unable to resect all of the cancer, though, so he also had to go through chemotherapy and radiation. He developed radiation burns, peeling skin and sores that wouldn't heal, in all the spots where they gave the radiation treatments. Chemo of course made him lose his hair and a ton of weight. He'd been healthy and athletic his whole life; I went off to summer camp when I was 15 and when I came back, after he'd started his course of treatment, it was like he'd aged 20 years in a few weeks.

All the treatments weren't enough and his cancer metastasized. It spread first to his femur and caused him severe pain. Creepily, our dog could smell the cancer inside him and would obsessively lick the same spot on his leg for hours if we didn't pull him away. Then it spread to his brain, and the tumor started to affect his personality. He started having terrible headaches and eventually, seizures. 

All this left him unable to care for me and my brother. As a 16-17 year old, I became the adult of the house (parents were divorced; my dad had primary custody), driving my little brother to football practice, doing the grocery shopping. I lived in fear that someone at school would find out how bad things were and we would become wards of the state. We had help from our extended family, too, but it was a scary way to live. And it was horrifying to watch my father, who had seemed so invincible and so good at everything, lose control of everything in his life, up to and including the ability to get himself to and from the bathroom. Before he went into hospice care his life was limited to watching TV in a recliner with a big container beside him for when he needed to pee. Occasionally he'd ask me to massage his bald head because that made the headaches from his incurable brain tumor feel better. I did it, out of love, but inside I was crushed, scared, and slightly disgusted by what had happened to him. 

My dad died the summer before I started college. I moved out of state to attend university and routinely lied about my family when meeting new people at school because I didn't know how to explain the emotionally grueling experience I'd endured for the past few years. I miss my dad every day, and I am so angry that he wasn't there to see me graduate from college, get married, accomplish my professional goals, and that he'll never know what kind of adult I grew up to be. But most of all, I'm furious with him for never trying to quit. For waiting until it was too late. For making me go through all of that because he enjoyed his bad habit. 

That's just my personal story, and maybe it won't have the same meaning to you. But if you can motivate yourself to do this, for the sake of your child, so that you can be there for him or her when s/he's grown, and spare him/her the suffering that my brother and I went through, please, for God's sake, throw the cigarettes in the trash and don't look back."

Maybe I'm weird though, I don't know. I walk to my neighborhood bar all the time. It's a sports bar, so the demographics are usually something like 60-80% dudes. If you know the bartender and the owner and it's your regular watering hole, why would you give a fuck?

Because someone, somewhere will always be acting like a thug. Often times, people who liken the government to a mafia....appear to want to replace government with a literal mafia. Government does not have to act like a mafia, it can also act like a concerned parent. At best, I see government as rules made by the people, for the people. I think we can agree this does not consistently happen, but really, I see nowhere for us to go but down.

&gt;Why do you think that? People rely on the voluntary consent of others all the time. If you want to make a baseball team, you don't just go out and enslave some baseball players, you get their voluntary consent to sign up.

Not the same. The thing is, capitalism doesn't rely on explicit coercion in some situations, but implicit. When you're given the choice to work or starve, you obviously work, but was it really a choice? And was it really voluntary? no more voluntary than sticking a gun to someone's head if you ask me. Just a different method. Except under your philosophy, one is the worst thing ever, and the other is perfectly acceptable. I think the two are closer than you think.

&gt;Why does society exist? What was the motivation to bring people together? What natural impulse do men obey when they band together into a society? What is the purpose of society?

Before I make a major decision, there's usually a stack of questions I ask myself before doing something risky.  What I did was add two statements right at the beginning of the stack.

The first thing I ask is ""is your gut reaction to this 'No?'"". Of course if my gut reaction is no, I won't do it.  After that I just repeat the words ""say yes"" in my head a few times until I actually say yes.  Additionally, make sure you are saying yes to someone else, not just yourself. Commitment is a powerful motivator.  Slowly this will get ingrained in your behavior.

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1391107706.0,"The break even point for a single person would be $37,500 under my current model, and $75,000 for a married couple. At this point, one begins to effectively pay taxes. I suspect you won't actually see a tax increase until you're well into the fourth quintile, or perhaps the fifth. Probably around $60k for a single earner, sure, but for a household with 2 adults? Probably much higher.

Median individual income is $27000 or so, and household is around $52,000. If you make the median you are still getting more than you pay in. The majority of the tax burden is taken on by the fifth/top quintile.

Also, in my early stages for my model, I toyed with 35% for those under $100k, 42% for $100-500k, and 50% for $500k+. However, I found it much more difficult to accurately estimate revenue coming in, and also failed to take in that married couples get such a good deal. A  drawback to lowering taxes on the poor is raising them on the rich, and I'm personally concerned about capital flight and tax evasion (even though I want to close loopholes) if the tax burden becomes too high. With state and local taxes, you can add another 10% to your tax burden, so we're talking a real burden of around 60% instead of 50%. This is higher than anywhere in the world, and anti competitive. 40% is pushing it enough, and even then, if revenue collection isn't perfect, we'd need to raise it probably to 42-45%. So...yeah. That's my reasoning there."

It's the same concept for countries that have hate speech.  Say what you want, but don't incite violence against subsets of the population.  Actual violence against them is a crime, so presumably you can get your point across by wording your statements differently, unless you *want* to incite violence, which is illegal.

I've always said there's 2 kinds of women that you'll date.  

There are parasites.  Who come into your life, take it over and eventually destroy you.  

And there's rockfuel for your car.  Where sure, gasoline is what you usually put in there.  But once you get some rocket fuel you're off!  

This is what you're describing.  Some women manipulate only for their benefit.  Others make sure their man gets something out of it too.

I like to think of the scene in The Avengers where Iron Man comes home to his girl after underwater welding.  He wants to stay in and bang the shit out of her, but she knows what's best for him.  She'd like to get attention from him but he has ""homework to do.""  So she leaves, sacrificing a night of attention and sex so that he can prepare to save the world.

He gets to be the awesome badass.  And now she's with a guy who's probably got the highest SMV of ANY man on earth!  (Rich, smart, sexy, confident, AND saved the world from evil!)

This is an example of positive manipulation.  And men love it."

I never got to watch DB when I was young aside from a few episodes, but I remember Goku had his tail at some point as well and would go on rampages. It makes sense that going into their ultimate form within their own body, effectively combining the SSJ and monkey transformation, would be more practical to being their fully realized strength."

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1391108035.0,"So this is going to be a little object lesson in psychoanalysis.  

I'll start by being a bit harsh. You can get compassion, or you can get a logical explanation of your world. You can't get both. This isn't because you suck, or you're a horrible person, or something like that. It's because the reality of the world is strictly indifferent. The moral fact that you, or your friend, went through horrible suffering, unfortunately, is of no consequence to how the world works in general. 

Here's the thing. Explanations of how the world works and explanations that make sense of individual, personal experience are two separate things. There was an anthropologist, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, who wrote a book on beliefs in magic and sorcery among people in what's now southern Sudan. He tried to explain why, for example, some perfectly intelligent and rational people believed not just in witchcraft--that wasn't the really crazy thing. The really crazy thing was that these people thought there was no such thing as natural death: in other words, why they believed that _all_ death was due to curses, malignant supernatural forces, and so on. 

What he concluded was that there was really no essential difference between this and any other religious belief. Magic and science explain different kinds of facts. In short, science explains why a granary falls down. Magic explains why the granary falls down and crushes my brother. For people without access to grief counseling, or whatever, it gives a moral view of the world. 

The point of this is precisely _not_ that these beliefs are wrong and superstitious. It's that all human beings, for whatever reason, can't live without magic. It's not that we in the west are more logical or intelligent than tribesmen in the south Sudan. It's that we have more complicated rationalizations. TRP is one of those rationalizations. 

Here's a little observation about TRP. It's pretty easy to grasp the core concepts. Indeed, people can empathize and debate them without really having precise definitions of what they are. But it's very difficult to puzzle out what makes them compelling to people. So to make a long story short, TRP is a lot like a system of popular theology. 

But here's what's conspicuous about TRP to me:there's another turn of the screw.In particular,  TRP claims to have the kind of amoral objectivity that a consoling explanation, in principle, can't have. 

What this implies to me is that TRP is a moral explanation of the world that denies that it really is one. But I think the logic is really a little more complex than that. You recognize on the other hand that TRP is also just a set of consoling notions that men use to pump each other for the dating game. You see, I don't believe that either. You're trying to have it both ways. 

Here's the tricky thing. I said two things earlier, just now, that are highly debateable. One was that there's a 'way the world really works' that can be contrasted with religious explanation. The other is that the world is morally indifferent to you--in other words, that there's nothing that you can do to shape reality. But there's a little bit of a conflation here. Which reality is it, exactly, that we don't have control over? It's not about the objective or subjective one, or the moral versus the amoral one. It's about the reality of ourselves. And that we do have control over.  

This is the other thing that I think you're lying about. You're projecting some kind of desire for ultimate truth onto us: that we want you to live up to some kind of standard of scientific truth, that's reflected in all those RP biotruths, applications of the pareto principle, and blah blah blah. Apparently we expect those things of you. But we don't. So what's going on? 

You're exchanging the moral world for the scientific, objective one as needed to divert the topic of discussion from yourself. Basically, your belief in science and rationality is your other rationalization. It's a very nice, tricky one because, after all, who could say that science is a rationalization of anything? Science is objective, after all. But you use it, I think, to deny that it's possible to change _yourself_.  You don't feel like you have agency because in actuality, you don't want it.   "

Battles big enough to be mentioned on an Eve blog, along with links to the articles, complete with videos showcasing a couple of battles, and the kill board stats.

So, you can decide for yourself if they were being *really* honest, or just jackasses who don't really mean it.

I have kind of a system for how I determine my attractiveness. If a guy who is interested in me is really good looking, I'll assume I'm on par with his attractiveness level. If he's really unattractive or weird, I'll assume I could be either really ugly or really pretty. It could go either way and there's no way to tell...

Also, sometimes I look at the attractiveness level of the dude's past girlfriends, and assume I must be around their attractiveness level. However, there's been multiple times this doesn't really work.

It's not fool-proof, but it just helps to get a better idea.

I absolutely despise using a number scale, but going off of what people have told me, and my view of myself, I'd guess somewhere around a 7. That always seems to be the safest number...not too high that it's cocky, not too low that it's unrealistic. A 7 is what I would tell people I think I am, but really sometimes I feel more like an 8. But that may be laughable to some people...this is why I hate the fucking numberline. All in all, I think I'm pretty attractive, but obviously not like the top tier of society.

He's basically saying we should deny voting rights to everyone, not only on welfare and unemployment, but literally to everyone who is a senior, because they're on social security, etc. He really just wanted to exclude everyone from voting who didn't think like him, who never needed help, and basically, just the libertarian jack***es who think people on public assistance are lazy moochers should not vote.

SRS and feminists/progressive/the SJW milieu, etc. like to use the ""white male"" qualifier because in the 21st century it's acceptable bigotry to dismiss issues faced by white men. They do it using this inculcated caricature that all white men are rich oil tycoon baby rapers and/or the false supposition of some sort of race-sex axis based trickle down economics, that somehow the common white man benefits because in majority white countries, the majority of politicians or rich are white-- which we all know is bullshit everywhere no matter your skin color or sex when you look all over the world. As a rule, the rich and powerful do not care about the plight of everyone else and are by and large insulated from many of the problems they face.

Those types also like to deny those issues affect men universally so they can continue the denial. Bottom line is they can't argue the actual issues because they have no moral, ethical, rational, or logical ground to stand on. So they try ridicule based on those things, and they try to censor, silence, bully speakers, writers into resigning or getting them fired via the bluelisting tactics that have been outlined here in SRSsucks and in sjsucks, and so on. They can't honestly engage in the discussions.

But yeah, too many white guys who are lucky enough to have a platform to speak out about this shit to a large audience are honestly spineless and capitulate to the weakest of pressure from these people. If they would just stand up to them they'd see they have zero actual power and could probably make them look really bad by weathering their attacks."

LordXerces,relationships,1391108499.0,"The problem was that it was already too late when I found out what she wanted. The guy she had been cheating on me with online (it sounds silly, but to her, the relationship she had with this dude she had never met was a hundred times more real than what we had at the time) had kind of opened her eyes to her own sexuality at the time.  
  
It's fucked up, because my sex-drive is insanely high. I fucked her constantly, and I always wanted to try new things. She was the one who was often reluctant to experiment. But the problem was that she wanted something exciting, not just sexually. After we had broken up, she told me that she needed a guy who would yell at her, emotionally destroy her, make her jealous, and make her feel like shit until he would invite her for cuddles. Also a guy who would pay zero regard to her sexual well-being. I always knew she had major problems with her own feelings of worth, but I never knew it was that critical. She had also been having very dark and brutal rape fantasies. When I asked her why the fuck she hadn't told me when that was something I could be into aswell, she said she wanted it to feel real. It reminded me of what Louis CK said, ""what? you just want me to go out on a limb and just **rape you**? Well, I'm getting a bit of a rapey vibe from this girl, what's the worst that could happen, huh?""  
  
I was eventually not satisfying to her, because no matter what I had done in bed, she did not want to be physically satisfied. She wanted to be mentally satisfied, sexually, and no matter what I had done, it was already too late by then. Things had become too familiar and too safe.  
  
So while it may sound as if I'm taking all of the blame for this, I know very well that she fucked up big time. She never tried communication. She never, ever tried to talk to me about these desires. She just let these things build up inside of her, believing that it would one day just magically occur to me and that I would give her what she had wanted. Instead of doing the right thing and attempting to spice things up, she waited it out until it was already too late."

- Divorce 

- Domestic abuse cases

- The draft, and conscription worldwide

- Lack of public support for DA, homelessness, poverty

Although he made clear that doctrine in those respects hasn't changed, he is steering the church about other core beliefs of Catholics: charity and tolerance, most of all.

From a political point of view, this is seen as a welcome change by most Catholics in a time where social norms are changing. Francis is reminding them that there are good reasons to apply Christian and Catholic values, and that it is not shameful to call yourself Catholic, just because the moral fabric of society is evolving from under their feet."

The skill makes them diagnose faster, and not having other jobs makes them have fewer excuses, but it doesn't make them prioritize their work ahead of things like talking to people or sitting stairing at a wall.

You can burrow them into the hospital, with the unfortunate side effect of having to deal with where they're going to eat and sleep (either microcontrol them, or put those in their burrow). 

Or, you can my favorite route and find quite a few dwarves that like helping people, have a sense of duty, and/or like to stay active, and give all of them the same doctoring labors. They should be less lazy and more useful for doctoring, even if they don't have very good skill yet."

Look for the enemy mid laner to step out of the minion wave, E into them, auto, Q along with ignite somewhere in there if they are staying to fight - they should be chunked pretty well at this point and if they flash, your flash will allow you to catch up due to the slow from your earlier landed E.

Riven is situational IMO. I have more experience with Riven top lane and I generally like to go 1-1-1 since it allows me to more trading combinations. However if I'm confident in my damage and the enemy has very little mobility I might consider going 1 points in Q just for the increased damage. If the lane is difficult if I'm going against a range champion that is harassing me down and playing safe, I might go two points in E just to be able to farm effectively without taking as much damage.

DoxasticPoo,TheRedPill,1391108897.0,"Actually, I'm going to rewrite one sentence.

""Because I have yet to meet a woman like that while dating.""

The last two words are important.  Because I have experienced women like you but just as friends.  I've come to realize that I put myself in the friendzone, not women.  Because I'm attracted to the love I feel when we're friends.  But I've never met a women who would be like that when we're more than friends.  And I think it's because women don't want to date a weak man.  And nurturing/tenderness implies someone is weak.  So instead of putting bandaids on my wounds then poke at them thinking it will make me stronger.  Irony is, it only makes me weaker.  Whereas a bandaid was all I needed in the moment.

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391109088.0,"Tolkien never decided how orcs came into existence. He had multiple theories, and the one he seemed to have settled on (orcs as Men corrupted by Melkor) would have required a major rework of the timeline, as orcs were involved in the earliest wars, before Men awoke in the East. It's clear, however, that he had decided that the Ainur could not create life independently (as shown by the Dwarves, who were animated only by Aule making them move with his spirit before Eru intervened and gave them true life). The Silmarillion contains an origin that has orcs as corrupted Elves, but Tolkien abandoned it late in life. Unfortunately, he died before he could rework the universe to account for orcs as Men.

Also, your concept of magic is close to correct. Tolkien in *On Fairy Stories* has this to say, in discussing the difference between Enchantment and Magic:

&gt;Enchantment produces a
Secondary World into which both designer and
spectator can enter, to the satisfaction of
their senses while they are inside; but in its purity it is
artistic in desire and purpose. Magic
produces, or pretends to prod
uce, an alteration in the
Primary World.

So, Magic in Tolkien's work is the exercise of will to produce a change in the primary world. But I think it's clear that it must be *only* will, not will plus something else. It's not magic when you swing a sword, but your will is behind that swinging, and it has a real effect in the primary world. Aragorn did not do Magic in that sense, because the effect he had was brought about by physical, primary-world actors. To compare, Gandalf rouses spirits in the Battle of Pelennor Fields by his mere presence, apparently using the Ring of Fire's power to extend his will to resist the cries of the Nazgul to those around him. Their actions are not what he dictates; it is their spirits, and their reactions to the Nazgul, that he influences with his will directly -- no intermediary, like words or argument, is necessary. That's Magic. Rousing speeches are not.

It's worth noting that Men definitely did have access to magic in Middle-Earth. The Mouth of Sauron, for instance, is described as a powerful sorcerer. (Tolkien in LOTR used ""Sorcery""/""guldur"" for black magic/capital-M Magic, and ""craft"" or ""skill"" for Enchantment; Galadriel discusses thee confusing use of the term ""magic"" to refer to both at one point)."

veryloudnoises,canucks,1391109100.0,"edler has a NTC, but can't that be avoided with his consent? or am i thinking of a NMC? 

ovi is 28, and i realize sedin is 33, but his age doesn't necessarily precipitate that steep a decline by itself. i'm wondering how much of the loss of point production is the missing PP quarterback and/or catalysts like ehrhoff and now salo. 

i mean, how many times in 2011 did we see ehrhoff streak up the center and dish to a sedin for the finisher? salo had such a good read on the ice and was nasty effective in keeping the puck in the offensive zone. it could be because i haven't seen it on the ice, but i can't remember seeing the same kind of synergy from garrison as with salo (which clearly might change with time), and as much as i like hamhuis, bieksa, aren't they all fairly interchangeable in terms of skill? we're really missing that d-man that the other #1 clubs have, the one that leads the charge offensively but can also act as a shutdown d-man. 

granted, ehrhoff wasn't shutdown defensively all the time, but he certainly could hold his own offensively. think about doughty, keith, chara, legends like lidstrom. i feel like the sedins and kesler really fed off our defense, and without that character of the offensive d-man, we're kind of adrift.

I must have missed all of the good publicity that sex work got in the media. I live (and worked) in a country where prostitution is decriminalised, and fairly acceptable, but I can't recall ever seeing a ""good side"" portrayed in the media. And forget about books that might highlight the positives, they're all about either a correlation between sex work &amp; drug abuse, human trafficking or how sex work is detrimental to society.

I understand that you might interested in a subject that is foreign to you but you're asking for perspectives on a topic that has more than enough negative focus. How about doing research on why people choose to work in an industry that most people don't understand and can stigmatise them? Try for a positive approach."

puppydog_smiles,Health,1391109195.0,"I have a couple of things to add.  First, the [Wiki cellulite page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulite) suggests that cellulite is related to hormones, which is why many women have it and most men do not.  Based on my understanding of the description, ""the herniation of subcutaneous fat within fibrous connective tissue that manifests topographically as skin dimpling and nodularity,"" it seems to me that the appearance of cellulite is due to the fibrous connective tissue, or structure underneath the skin.  I would assume that losing fat would reduce the appearance of cellulite, but not necessarily get rid of it completely. 

As far as diet and exercise go, I recently stumbled on an article in an online magazine (I can't remember which one) that referenced [Lauren Fleshman's blog](http://asklaurenfleshman.com/2013/11/keeping-it-real/comment-page-2/) post about her body.  If you don't know who she is, she's an Olympic runner and elite athlete.  

That being said, going back to the science, I think it's the fibrous tissue that needs to be addressed to stop the dimpling effect.  I found [this video](http://www.drdamico.com/cellulaze.cfm) animation of a cosmetic procedure that is supposed to break up the tissue.  It really demonstrates how it pulls down the skin to form the dimples, and how the procedure works to remove the dimples.  "

Tell her you care about and want to be with *her* but that when she's trying to appease you so much she isn't being her, she's just being a ""yes"" woman. Tell her you want to know and be with *her* for her opinions and her hobbies and what she brings to the whole world not just to your relationship. 

Maybe schedule a night to be with friends or be solo. Maybe look up community groups (acting, volunteering, art, dance, whatever) that you think she may be interested in and show her. She clearly needs some stimulation other than your relationship. 

Don't just break up with her. Give her the chance to make this right. But if she chooses not to do that, then you two clearly aren't right for each other. Sometimes people just need different levels of closeness in a relationship. You have to find someone whose needs are compatible with yours. "

Maybe that's just a case for those people? In regards to myself, I study at a predominately arts university which pushes the boundries of creativity, so I wouldn't say that my University gives us all a set of rules. And in fact, most reputable sources have a house style, which sets the guideline for that publication...

Also, your argument isn't a case for a course being pointless, just that other things can matter more when applying for a job. Which can be true.

Last time many years ago, it was a whisper HOB filter, and the magnet burned up and started dumping smoke into my tank. The water got all cloudy and the house stunk of electrical burn .I threw that POS out and switched to all canister filters. 

Now, its this light. Never an issue and just the other day too I said, hmm maybe I should get new lights just for the hell of it, since petco had that 30% flash sale going on.  In 15 years of aquarium keeping, and many ballasts and bulbs burning out, and smacking them to turn on, etc..this is a first, that turned into a flame and melted/smoked. AND its on a surge protector, so it didnt short or anything

The other bulb in the photo still works just fine, which is leading me to believe that the bulb burned out, possibly overheating and then frying the setup, which is why I mentioned to keep tabs on your bulbs.

I read a good article in the German newspaper Die Zeit once (and can't seem to find it again) that claimed that the percentage of German parents who think that spanking is ""necessary"" for a kid is around 7% while more than 2/3 of Americans believe that.

If Lenovo keeps most of Motorola's executive team, it's likely that they'll continue their current course. It all depends on what Lenovo plans on doing.

I'm not too worried, because Lenovo has been continuing the Thinkpad line from IBM fantastically. Thinkpads are still pretty much the best PC laptop you can buy, and they keep coming out with great products. Their current mobile phone division, while it has been innovative by being the first to use intel processors, has been lagging behind lately. They make decent enough hardware, but their software sucks balls. They have one of the crappiest overlays on the market and don't add much value to Android. Hopefully they'll see the positive feedback from the Moto X and G and switch to mostly-stock Android with useful value-added features.

hakspeare,summonerschool,1391109467.0,"First off, I'd recommend playing some ADC in blind pick or with friends to improve your support play since that is your second best role. 

When you ADC, you'll find yourself wondering why the support isn't doing something such as warding the lane bushes or warding when you are pushing the lane and thereby overextending. In order to more suitably support your AD you should have an awareness of how to best allow him to farm and succeed in the game.


Mid


Kassadin is nearly 100% banned, I believe it's been around 90% for quite some time. If you are first pick you could get away with not banning Kassadin if you wish to play him, at the very least forcing a ban from purple side to use on him. 

Your other mid laners are very safe and able to farm well. I recommend trying out Ziggs as he has a similar play style.


Support


Thresh of course is amazing, I love Janna as well, haven't had much experience with Morgana support but I guess it is dependent upon spell-shielding properly and landing q's. 


I'd recommend perhaps learning Alistar or Sona so you can have a 
support with healing ability for tougher laners. Alistar deals well with the other supports who want to get in such as Leona, Thresh, Blitz as he can somewhat negate their cc with his own while also having the advantage of sustain. Sona is more about poking down the enemy bot lane and abusing their lack of sustain or forcing them to use their mana to sustain through your poke.

Don't have time for the other roles right now but I can finish them for you later if you'd like!"

&gt;Plus, and I'm curious now, how are those Jewish charities and religious outreaches to the hungry, homeless and poor going?

You mean the [people I work for](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=11440)? We do very well. But here are some fun articles and numbers

absinthevisions,AskWomen,1391109503.0,"Yes. Once while I was working in a strip club. I had worked there for years and had earned my place in the hierarchy that occurs in all these places. I was well liked by most people that worked there and left alone by everyone else. I'm more of an ""alternative"" girl. Weird hair colors, tattoos, wore mostly black, and danced to rock. I had lots of regulars that just came to see me.

A new girl started and she thought she was going to stroll in and run the place. She was pretty ""ghetto"" and not my clients type. She didn't like me from day one because of how I looked. She kept calling me a witch and making fun of me. I ignored her.

One night it was super slow. The weather wasn't great (it was snowing in an area that doesn't handle snow well) and not a lot of people were out. A lot of girls were sitting around drinking because there wasn't anything else to do. I however had a pretty steady stream of regulars and was making money. She gets pissed at this.

I say goodbye to one regular as another was coming in. I told him that I was going to run to the dressing room and I would be right with him. This guy was known as MY regular. He did not come to see anyone but me. He tolerated a couple of my friends but he didn't spend money on them. He would buy them drinks, food, and would maybe tip them $10 or so though the night. I get back on the floor and she's sitting with him. He made it clear that he was there to see me and he wasn't interested. He bought her a drink and gave her $2 and wanted her to go away. It didn't work. She sat there forever. We were talking and she had no clue about the subjects but she was still trying to butt in. She was making fun of me to the guy the whole time. He got dances from me during a special and she got even more pissed. She easily sat with us for 2 hours. I easily made $200 plus tips and sold all of my drinks from my drink quota. She had gotten one drink and $2. She keeps trying to sell him dances and he keeps telling her no. We get up and go do more dances and she leaves while we're gone. 

She's now standing by the main bar yelling to the manager (who is one of my best friends to date) about me. After I finish I need to trade in some small bills out of my garter. I go to the bar. She's pissed and calls me out on screwing her over, telling the guy not to get dances from her, and stealing him away from her. I'm very calm though the whole thing and explain that he's my regular and she's not his type. During this she throws a drink at me and swings at my face. She misses. I don't think and just react. I punch her in the face twice with everything I have and kick her 7 inch stripper heels out from under her.   She hit the floor and jumped back up and came back after me. The manager grabs her, picks her up, and removes her from the building. He sets her outside in the snow in her stripper wear. He has a bouncer go up cut her locker open, stuff all her stuff in a garbage bag, and then throw it outside to her. Meanwhile the manager is erasing the security footage and calling the cops to get her off the property. 

Cops show up and she's still standing at the door that has been locked to bar her entry. She is still in stripper wear. She's pounding on the door and screaming. She's threatening to kill the manager, the bouncers, me, the door girl, and to burn the building down. The cops try to get her to calm down and talk to them. She punches one in the face and runs to her car. She gets it started but they block her exit. She crashes into the cop car and one of the other girl's cars. She's arrested for DUI, assaulting a police officer, drunk and disorderly, resisting arrest, damage to private property, and a slew of other things. They don't even question me. I ice my hand and go on about my night.

She ended up in some major trouble and sat in jail for awhile. I heard I broke her nose and cracked her cheekbone. I busted two knuckles open. Other than that nothing happened to me. "

Boethias,askscience,1391109530.0,"Perhaps impossible is a bad choice of words.  But in practice you won't find it unless you are looking for it.  Most patients aren't body scanned for no reason.  The first physical symptom to manifest is usually the lack of menstruation at the onset of puberty.  

In some cases the testes may partially descend and cause a hernia.  In that case it may be detected earlier.

On DCS:  The individual will be physically male.  XX males are always infertile.  The X chromosome has genes for male fetal development but not for sperm production so they cannot produce viable sperm.  Other than that though they will be largely indistinguishable from conventional males.

YY is impossible for exactly the reason you mentioned.  The X carries vital code so a YY fetus will spontaneously abort.

&gt;what about XX where both X's contain male chromosomes? (I assume that could only happen with laboratory intervention, since the mother couldn't pass down such an X chromosome naturally.

You are right that this could not happen naturally.  For ethical reasons it will probably never be attempted in a lab either."

Some of these guys go years without any sex, and since this guy is willing to drive 200 fucking miles for a girl that is undoubtedly fucking other guys (200 miles away? come on) then yeah, it's probably been that bad for him.

Drop_,DotA2,1391109673.0,"I think Ogre is underestimated by a lot of people.  IMO he actually works incredibly well in the current meta, being able to trilane and roam well.  Additionally, he is one of the tankiest level 1 heroes in the game, which makes playing agressively much less risky.  

Some notes on ogre: 

1. Before you get multicast, Ignite is his biggest nuke.  At level 4 ignite does a total of 400 dmg compared to fireblasts 275.  In fact, Fireblast doesn't overtake it in terms of (expected) damage until Multicast is level 2 at level 11.  So, it really should be maxed first.    

2. Consider skipping rank 1 multicast at level 6 and instead dropping the point into Fireblast.  Leveling up Fireblast gives you an 65 dmg increase for 10 mana, while leveling up Multicast increases the (expected) damage by 25% for a 30 mana increase.  In fact, you can really skip multicast until you have Fireblast maxed.  

3. Bloodlust is an amazing skill, and IMO justifies a point at least at level 4.  The attack speed is ok, but the real value is the move speed.  A 10% move speed buff, combined with a 20-26% move speed slow on the enemy can guarantee your carry gets several right clicks off on the enemy in the early game.  

4. Multicast is good, but realistically the main benefit is to Fireblast, and as mentioned above, it can be skipped until you have both ignite and fireblast maxed.  

IMO his build should be Q -&gt; W -&gt; W -&gt; E -&gt; W -&gt; Q -&gt; W -&gt; Q -&gt; Q -&gt; R -&gt; R

When playing Ogre, really try to leverage his early game tankiness.  At level 1 he has 6 armor and 23 strength, meaning you can trade hits with anyone (though it's dumb to try to trade hits with any hero which can kite you).  

Picking up an early Orb of Venom is great on him for the 12% slow. This, combined with Ignite nets a significant move speed slow, and should be enough to net a kill assuming you have some help in lane.  It's best to get off the right click first, but hitting a stun and then walking into an attack and following up with ignite is also good.  

Casting Bloodlust on yourself before you go in for the kill also increases your chances of getting in range and getting all your slows off.  

Starting items should be typical support.  Tangoes, Salve, 2x Clarity, 2x Iron Branches, and Courier or Wards.  

Ogre has a ton of potential which I think gets overlooked as people see him as a 1 hit wonder with fireblast, and multicast.  But IMO he has much more presence in the game before Fireblast and Multicast are maxed.  In reality he brings quite a bit of utility and early game presence to the table, and fits into a trilane or roaming ganker roles very well.  His biggest strength is his ability to be agressive early game.  So don't let that window pass you by if you pick him.  "

Honestly I haven't been terribly impressed with either our running game or our OL this year. They were shut down completely in the games that mattered(Stanford, Arizona, Oregon State). The only bright spot I saw was the UCLA game. Everything else on offense was either Mariota passing, Mariota running, or teams that are awful on defense. I could stick just about any first string RB in the country into our system and put up 200+ against Colorado or Wazzu.

NAME	                       GP	CAR	YDS	YDS/G	TD	LNG	FUM	LOST

vs BCS ranked teams	2	24	62	31	         0	21	0	0

24 carries, 62 yards. That's awful for this offense.  And that includes Mariota too.

Per player, things weren't exactly any better. Marshall and Tyner are not bad by any means, but I expected a little more given our history as a run-first team. Once you remove Mariota's threat from the equation, Marshall and Tyner had pretty pedestrian games when they were expected to be *the guy* rushing.

**Texas**
              CAR	YDS	AVG	TD	LG

Marshall	13	43	3.3	0	14

**Arizona**

Thomas     16	83	5.2	0	20

Tyner	11	53	4.8	0	14

**Stanford**

Marshall	11	46	4.2	0	21

Blacksheep01,totalwar,1391109822.0,"The only games that I ever play for more than 2 hours in a sitting are RTS/TBS type games, they are my crack. My first RTS ever was Caesar III way back in 1999 and I distinctly remember sitting down to play around 4 p.m. (Friday, after high school day) and thinking ""I'll just play a few hours"" and the next time I looked at the clock it was 3:15 a.m. lol.

But this is about TW games! I am a Roman historian these days (finishing up a master's thesis about Rome now) but I also work full time and am married (no kids though). So my 12 hour playing sessions have dwindled. Still, I built a new PC over Christmas (took that week off) specifically for Rome II and that PC is connected to my TV. The second day I had the PC running, I launched Rome II around 5 p.m. and played non-stop (except food/bathroom breaks) until 4:30 a.m. I'm in my early 30s now, I didn't feel proud, but man was it fun to do that as a one off!

Back when Rome I was out in fall 2004 I was also taking Roman history, but in undergrad, so I was busy, but on Friday or Saturday nights I'd pull off 12 hour sessions. While I love other historical eras, Napoleonic Wars, Japanese Warring States period and parts of the Middle Ages, I never play those games as much. I think I have like 45 hours total in Napoleon and 38 hours in Shogun, the older TW games weren't in Steam at first (and Steam didn't keep hours) so no idea on hours. But in Rome II I have 127 hours logged, if Rome I kept time I'd bet it was near 300 as I played the main campaign in Rome I for 4 months. When that was over, I reconquered the world as Carthage."

rockspeak,weddingplanning,1391110025.0,"1.  Take a breath.  It's entirely possible that your mom forgot, and the store messed something up, that your mom has cancer and doesn't know how to tell you, and has no money for your alterations and thus doesn't want to bring it up.  Just... take a second to consider that this may not be a malicious attack on you, her daughter.

2.  If talking about money makes your mom feel guilt tripped into helping pay for things, then don't discuss money with her.  Yes, she's your mom, but life is life and if you *know* that A will cause B, and you don't like B, don't do A.  Maybe you didn't know she would react that way, but I'm assuming y'all have discussed money before and you know how your mom reacts to things.  Either way, you can't change the past, but moving forward, it may be best not to discuss the financial burden side with her, if it makes her feel obligated or guilted.

3.  You should discuss with your mother, face to face, about the payment you had to make on the dress.  Explain using ""I"" instead of ""you"" so she doesn't feel attacked.  Such as ""I thought we agreed to a payment plan you would keep up with on the alteration fees.  I may be confused, so I'd like to know more from you."" versus ""You were supposed to make payments on this dress.  What did you do that messed that up?""

When it comes to parental involvement in paying for things, there are always eggshells to walk on.  You know your mom much better than those of us here in this subreddit.  You know the most logical way to approach her, and if it turns out she's turning into a momzilla and hates you forever and did this to spite you...  well, you can cut her out of the wedding YOU are paying for, and reimburse her the few hundred she has contributed.

&gt;  What adult does that? Especially to their child? All I ask is that if she says shes going to do something, she do it. Or at least give me notice.

Assuming that someone did something on purpose is a surefire way to make drama and cause hurt feelings.  Please step back and have a rational conversation with your mother."

Buelldozer,MLS,1391110123.0,"""the goal is to develop technical ability and knowledge of the game."" Those things are not incompatible with winning, in fact the better your players are at them the MORE they should win. You show on the field what you're learning in practice. This is true in absolutely every other sport. On field execution is the exhibition of the players skills and knowledge and the Coach's strategy.

I wouldn't describe my son's team as ""direct and physical"", I'd describe it as creative and adaptable. Who said anything about ""disregarding principles and style"" ? In previous post I said that Executing a Coach's strategy is a necessity. 

I'm not talking about youths running amok on the field doing what they want, I'm talking about in game adaption to your opponent, sometimes on a moment by moment basis. Retain your 3-3-4 strategy but if the center lane is plugged be flexible enough to move your attack to the outside and then bring it back in. Tough right back? Shift to carrying down the center and striking from the opposite side! Your left back having trouble with the other teams attack? Use your left-center to shore them up (cover) and have your true CB provide balance.

If your players can't make these kinds of adaptations then they are not developing correctly. If the Coach won't LET them make these kinds of adaptations then they are a poor Coach.

This is a national board and we're discussing U.S. Youth Soccer and its failings. I'm a former coach, a current parent, and an active referee. I have a fair bit of practical and current knowledge of this subject.

Your comment ""all we care about is development so that we can hopefully produce better top end talent."" makes me snort. It's complete and utter _crap_. WE ARE DOING IT WRONG. We're producing automatons with little creativity and limited knowledge of the game and the rest of the world agrees."

Sure, a large customer service is great when it was in Beta and for the few 2 years, because there are tons of bugs and shit and whatnot, right? But *come on*! It's nearing 5 years since LoL was released, and the people who play that game should be seeing high-quality stuff right about now! Dota2 is just starting its 1st year since release, and we've got so much going for us!

And here's the kicker. They (Riot) said that they're aiming for e-sports growth. 

*wtf?*

Before focusing on the whole e-sports scene, they should goddamn make a game that is e-sports worthy.

I'm not saying LoL isn't fun, but Riot is focusing on the Pubs more than the Pros. They even balance the champions not because the champ is truly OP, but because the  public outcry is saying ""champ is OP"". Tl;DR, *they balance the game for the Pubs, not the Pros.* 

It's the complete opposite for Icefrog.

With all that money that they've gathered from the last 4 years, they should *really* start focusing on stuff other than champion skin sales.

I'm just saying that if they start to focus, right now, on making a **quality LoL game** that has a **decent** client that isn't made from goddamn Adobe AIR, quickly removing game-breaking bugs and shit as soon as they pop up, they won't get much customer outrage, meaning they won't need **that** much customer service."

* Big, but crappy basement room in Bryant area in a 5 bedroom house -all utilities included (including internet) = 425 per month

Delts28,Scotland,1391110626.0,"Saved this to do a proper write up whilst not on my phone.  I was a student there for 3 years from 2006.

For where to live, you get a choice of halls, most of which have single rooms.  The older ones have shared rooms but they tend to only be given to freshers.  If you like you could even find your own flat, although competition is extremely fierce.  Best bet is halls although they can be fairly expensive.  I personally like DRA (David Russell Apartments).  Mainly en-suite, double beds, five people to a kitchen.

I can't comment on the classes, I was there for Physics.  Most of the IR students that I knew though were out getting drunk fairly regularly though.

Good and Bad about the uni, I'm not sure what you'd like to know here.  If you want to specify more I'll try to answer.

Social scene is largely pub based.  There is an insane number per head.  Big range in style as well.  House parties are also a big feature.  There are no clubs per se.  The student union's main hall had two club nights per week though.  Cheesy but regularly 400+ people there.  Good nights it'll hit 1,000 (capacity).  Sex life, depends on who you hang out with.  If you want one night stands you'll find them, just like at any UK uni really.  Much more chance of bumping into ex's at the pub though with the towns size.

International students are treated the same as anyone else really (bar the Chinese who were extremely insular when I was there).  The huge international population means that you won't be a special flower in any way shape or form."

Longer straps -&gt; greater difficulty.  So you lose a little potential there as well.  It just several small compromises.  Still, having rings at all is far far preferable than waiting to be able to afford to put a ring tower in your back yard.  Ya dig?

BIOdire,WTF,1391110898.0,"Actually, you're not exactly correct. You must cater to the particular snake you are feeding.

Cream is an old boy, of twenty years, and is over four feet long. He is a friendly snake at our facility who we use for our performances at birthdays, and who generally helps people get over their fear of snakes. To feed him, we *must* warm it, and lay it on the flat portion of his take. He will slither up and just start to eat it.
 
Rio, a particularly young snake, prefers to have the mouse shaken for him. He will strike hard, and squeeze, even though it is already dead. However, he will eat it if it's just lying there. He doesn't really discriminate.

Conclusion: If you shake it for Cream the snake, he just lies there and ignores you."

reginaidiotarum,TiADiscussion,1391110978.0,"Feminism is too influential as a movement. Because it was founded in opposition to an oppressor class, it feels all challenges are a result of that oppression. As a result, feminism is not about equality, it was never about equality, and it cannot achieve equality. It is just hard to oppose a movement that claims it supports everyone.

It's also a slap in the face when it does not support everybody.

The best ""a priori"" definition of Feminism that I could come up with, something that is inherent to the nature of the term is someone that wants to ""empower women."" Within the community, the level of which empowering is debatable, but ultimately when you no longer believe you need to empower women is when you say you are not a feminist anymore.

If a force like this exists, it needs to be checked against another force that works to empower men. Or, rather, it will inevitably find another force that works to empower men because as men exist and feel oppressed in some means, some of them will try to fix it.

I personally agree with you, Egalitarian is the best outcome, working toward a gender neutral society. It would also get rid of a perpetuating class struggle. Feminism is the revolting proletariat working toward a greater dictatorship. Egalitarian is the communist, free of class and struggle."

D/D Elementalist primarily stays alive through the use of its skills and proper positioning. You do not need super tanky gear to play large zerg fights, you need the experience and skill to dodge and position yourself correctly. A D/D Elementalist also doesn't stay on the tag all the time, it weaves in and out to deal its damage and avoid the oncoming damage. You aren't in there spamming auto-attacks as much as Warriors are.

If you want to play it tanky, then you can do so with 6/6 Melandru + Lemongrass + a decent amount of Armor (~2600), but as you get more used to playing the Elementalist you may find yourself swapping in more offensive gear when you realize how large of a role positioning + proper dodges actually play.

ANewMachine615,explainlikeimfive,1391111290.0,"Nope. The Valar didn't come to the War of Wrath. The Vanyar, Valinorin Noldor, and some Sindar/non-Exile Elves fought, led by Eonwe, Herald of Manwe. Againor was made by Aule after the *first* war between Melkor and the Valar, which occurred around the time the Elves were waking up. We're actually not told who finally casts down Morgoth in the War of Wrath:

&gt;Then the sun rose, and the host of the Valar prevailed, and well-nigh all the dragons were destroyed; and all the pits of Morgoth were broken and unroofed, and the might of the Valar descended into the deeps of the earth. There Morgoth stood at last at bay, and yet unvaliant. He fled into the deepest of his mines, and sued for peace and pardon; but his feet were hewn from under him, and he was hurled upon his face. Then he was bound with the chain Angainor which he had worn aforetime, and his iron crown they beat into a collar for his neck, and his head was bowed upon his knees. And the two Silmarils which remained to Morgoth were taken from his crown, and they shone unsullied beneath the sky; and Eönwë took them, and guarded them.

It could be argued that the ""might of the Valar"" refers to the actual Valar, but it has always been my impression (especially given the requirement that Sauron follow Eonwe back to Valinor to receive the judgment of the Valar on his repentance) that the Valar were not present. This makes sense with their reluctance to intervene, being aware that their combat would reshape the world as a byproduct. Of course, Beleriand was sunk, but we see a lot worse going on in the early wars between Melkor and the other Valar -- the entire World is basically their battlefield in the earliest conflicts, and they seem to fight with the very fabric of the World as their weapon. You raise a mountain? I'll make it a valley. You create a sea? I will drain it. That sort of thing."

And both sets of privileges are the result of patriarchy. If patriarchy didn't instill this weird idea that women can't take care of themselves and need a man to protect and provide for them, a lot of privileges would disappear on both sides. 

As soon as society acknowledges that, while there are biological differences between the genders, both a man and a woman are equally capable in today's society. Patriarchy made sense in the past, mostly because the physical differences made a huge and important determination on whether or not a family are or had shelter or protection.

If you have volume issues, invest in a decent set of headphones for when the baby is sleeping, like these:  

http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391109620&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=sony+mdr-7506

sennheiser studio headphones are good, too.

I'd start with something like this:

http://www.crutchfield.com/p_022RXV375/Yamaha-RX-V375.html#details-tab

Ignoring the fluff that every company has, Yamaha has a nice, smooth sound.  There are four regular digital audio plugs, a few RCA plugs, and four HDMI inputs for easier cable management.  The &lt;0.09% THD is good for the money.  It's cheap enough that you shouldn't feel bad about upgrading it later, but still *good*.

If you want the speakers on the shelf itself, you'll need the dimensions of the shelf itself first.  that will determine what you can and cannot use.  

second, get in a store and *listen* to them.  get some music with a lot of detail in the mid-range, that you can pick out individual instruments or sounds.  I like swing music for this, because it's easy to focus individual horns, and the midrange is the hard part (especially the low-mid areas, like a tenor/baritone sax).  music that has flavor in the low end (like this: DJ Krush: [Beyond Raging Waves](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrZhdzGaPxo)) instead of just thumps is what you want to test low-end response.

you're *not* going to get a ton of detail in the low end with cheap speakers, but you wouldn't take a Cavalier to a drag strip, either, so make sure your expectations set right, first.

bigger speakers mean more control, not more volume.  Try to get something with 6.5"" main drivers if you can, but that might be constrained by the price point.

If the bookshelf could hold it, try this:

http://www.crutchfield.com/p_108P163BK/Infinity-Primus-P163.html

Yamaha+Infinity is a good combo, even on the low-end.  I have Denon+Infinity at home, but go with what sounds right to you.  *no satellite speakers*.   Remember, you can always add a sub later.

that will put you close to your $500 mark, not counting cables or the headphones.

edit: apparently you need a phono plug for a turntable instead of just a standard RCA hookup.  this means either getting a stereo amp, [like this](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_580TX8050/Onkyo-TX-8050.html) or [this](http://www.crutchfield.com/p_580TXN626/Onkyo-TX-NR626.html).  The first one is within the budget, but the second is more functional and easier to connect everything via the HDMI cables (no nest of wires = good), among other features.

edit 2:

god damn it, I'm second-guessing myself, so fuck it; find whatever bookshelf speakers sound good to you, then add a [Martin Logan Dynamo 300](http://www.amazon.com/MartinLogan-Dynamo-300-Theater-Subwoofer/dp/B004LRPXAU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391113909&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=martin+logan+dynamo) to fill out the low end.

OctavianRex,nba,1391111597.0,"NBA contract's exploded in size around 1995, look at pretty much every big name player and you will see a huge increase in size of their contract around that time/next few years. Not to Jordan's level, but players began to double their earlier salaries.  Even after Jordan retired his contract was kept by the Bulls, this meant when he came back in 1994/1995 and into the 95/96 season he retained his pre-boom salary. After that point Jordan/Krause was unsure of his status and they negotiated a huge short term contract. Krause specifically had become incredibly irate at Phil Jackson as well as actual and perceived slights from the players. He knew he could not destroy the championship team, but was already preparing to move forward.

Jordan was by far best player in the league and the Bulls pretty much threw the entire cap at Jordan as the deal was one year and would have no long term effects."

jednorazowa,AskWomen,1391111682.0,"If you haven't done it yourself before, you might not be able to do it successfully the first time.  There's a knack to it, especially some of the more difficult areas, and it takes practice.

If you do try it yourself buy a sugaring kit instead of a waxing kit the first time.  The enormous advantage of sugaring is it can wash off easily with a damp cloth, whereas the wax has to be removed with a special oil and it's tricky to do. If it's your first time, you **will* at some point end up with a clump of hair that won't come out with gunk all stuck to it, so it's better to have the easier clean-up. 

That said, if you have the time for a failed attempt, I think it's worth buying a drugstore sugaring kit and giving it a try.  You might end up happy with the results, and worst case you'll just have to pay to have it done professionally anyway.

Edit: also, if you haven't done wax/sugaring on your pubic area before at all, don't do a full brazilian on your first attempt.  Just do your outer bikini line, and see what the regrowth phase is like.  I find it comfortable and effortless, but others in this thread have complained of irritation."

RecoilS14,AskReddit,1391111837.0,"I had two main bullies, one from the start of middle school till graduation (Roger) and one just in middle school (Tim).  I was the small kid in middle school and didn't start growing till the summer between grade 9 and 10. 

Tim tortured me in middle school with his buddies when they caught me without my friends. It sucked. After grade 9, he moved to a different part of town and started going to a different school so that ended that. After my first two years of college I found him working fast good and that made me chuckle, another 5yrs later he was still there. 

Roger was just an asshole and constantly picked on me to make himself seem better, I ended up kicking his ass at our prom because he was trying to pick up my date.  I knew school was done and I wouldn't see him again and that gave me courage to fight him. He swore revenge. Fast forward about 6yrs, I'm in line to get in to a club where my buddies were already and he's standing a few people in front of me.  He doesn't notice me right away, but when he does he starts talkin shit and acting all tough because I was alone and he had his friends. 

He tries picking a fight with me for about 5 mins when I finally say something along the lines ""I'm not gonna fight you when you're buddies will just jump when I start to win"".  They all said we won't do shit, this his shit and we don't know you. So I tell him ""fine, let's go"" and I step out of line and on to the street. It took me about 10 seconds to lay him on his ass and get back in line.  After that he knew he was powerless against me, both physically and mentally and now tries to be a decent human around me when we run in to each other but he is still an asshat to most people.  I later found out he is a coke addicted woman beater and still hasn changed to this day.

Helt rätt. Men håll i dig nu.

En bieffekt av Lexbase, och att man lätt kan hitta om någon förekommit i ett brott mål blir att man väldigt lätt kan få tag i belastningsregistret. Det är nämligen så här: innan man meddelar dom i brottmål skriver man ut ett exemplar av belastningsregistret. När man skrivit ut belastningsregistret blir det en allmän handling som kan begäras ut av vem som helst.

Så, om jag vet att person X är dömd, kan jag ringa till den dömande domstolen och begära ut person X:s belastningsregister. Något konstigt, men så är det."

I'm not sure about LA, but I know that in the Northeast/greater NYC area, the culture is very much ""get married later, have kids later"" and it can be very materialistic and self-serving.

ZapActions-dower,gallifrey,1391111936.0,"Moffat has said interviews before that the Doctor doesn't really have any idea how old he is.  Even as Four he didn't know his exact age until Romana told him.  The best estimate that can be given is around 2200, but that has the major assumption that since Ten he hasn't been straight up making up numbers, that the Tales of Trenzalore book has the time he spent on Trenzalore correct, and that Nine and Ten started counting their age from when they left Gallifrey rather then when they were born.

Seven says he's 953 years old.  Nine claimed to have been travelling for 900 years.  If Romana is correct on Four's age and One's age when he left Gallifrey, then there is about 250 years to be added to the age that Ten gives, making him more accurately about 1150 years old, making Eleven before Trenzalore about 1350 years old, plus 900 years on Trenzalore, making the Doctor about 2200 years old, because some of those numbers are rounded up and because 900 is a roundabout number.

That's the best estimate there is, assuming that the numbers he's been giving are roughly accurate relative to the last number he gave.  And the best question is:  does he even care?  I doubt it."

Below is a long rambling story about my experience with gaming that I don't recommend anyone reads.


I started playing WHFB when I was 7 back in 1995. I lived across the street from a comic book store that had three game nights a week. My dad played D&amp;D at the time and was good friends with the owner and some of the regulars. I was bullied at school and really unhappy so my dad bought me models to try and make me enjoy my childhood. 

The store owner was a really great guy who had way more patience than I  will ever have. He helped me glue together my first army and gave me the beat up store copies of all the army books when he decided to replace them with new ones.  I still remember struggling to read the High Elf army book during recess to learn all of the rules.

My first games were against my dad borrowing his DM's Wood Elves against my High Elves. I feel in love with the hobby and the people who treated me like a friend. 

I spent my entire allowance on Warhammer from ages 7-14 collecting all the armies and playing two games a week. At 14 I started working at the comic book store and playing 40k, Necromunda, D&amp;D and Magic the Gathering. I only painted 5 models from 7-17, I didn't have the patience to layer and I couldn't deal with crappy paint jobs. 

I took a break while in college and bought nothing. Two years ago I got back into the hobby and went kinda crazy. I was lucky that my parents saved all my models, but the new kits are so amazing that I spend all my hobby time on the new stuff. While I used to be all about playing, now I am all about painting and modeling. 

The game used to be about socializing for me, but the people playing the game nowadays in FLGS are not as friendly as the guys when I was a kid. Regardless, even though I can afford/have the models to play almost anything, I just can't find the right community.

Vaguely_Reckless,AskReddit,1391112025.0,"**This is what helped my roommate quit:**  I work in a lab researching Cystic Fibrosis which is a disease that primarily affects the lungs. There is no cure for it yet, people are born with it and generally their life expectancy is only about 30 years. It is caused by a mutated gene that affects an important protein within our cells making that protein mostly non-functional. There is another researcher in my lab that is researching the affects of cigarette smoke and recently she found that smoking cigarettes *affects the exact same protein* within the lung cells. Basically, cigarette smoking biologically mimics Cystic Fibrosis. When I told my roommate that he was basically ""giving himself Cystic Fibrosis,"" it really resonated with him and he switched to an e-cigarette to help him quit smoking.

mermalerm,AskFeminists,1391112612.0,"So this is probably going to be *incredibly* controversial here, but here goes: 

I am not religious, but I don't like the way that some feminists oversimplify the abortion debate by emphasising the foetus' lack of personhood. I think some feminists often treat abortion as a black-and-white issue, where it's just like any other operation and the foetus/embryo is just a clump of cells that can be removed like an appendix. I understand that this treatment is really useful for discouraging people from shaming those who have had abortions, but I do think the debate and the act itself is far more complicated than this depiction suggests.

I think the emotional trauma some women suffer from after an abortion gives the issue another dimension that this framing seems to ignore. It's not that abortion is ""killing"" or any of that nonsense- it's that, while some women may think of it as being a simple removal of cells, it can often be a far more difficult decision for others and I think the clump-of-cells/rights-over-body argument can invalidate that fact. As such, I rather dislike how some feminists act as though abortion ought to be the default choice for women with unplanned pregnancies, and I've seen many- especially on /r/relationships or /r/TwoXChromosomes - encourage it without qualification, particularly for younger women. I'm certainly not against abortion, but I do think it's a big decision and a big problem- one that doesn't have a simple, neat answer."

This too makes sense.  You want him to be happy because as a high value male, you don't want to lose him.  Maybe he's the highest value male you think you could get out in the SMP.  Or maybe you don't want to risk not being able to find another man of equal or greater value.  So you're willing to make him happy.

The LTR guys sometime say you have to select a woman of lesser value.  Or to put it another way, you have be the highest value man she could possibly get (the implication is that she's lesser value).  And looking back, all of my good relationships have been like that.  This seems to back that up."

One of the hardest things I find explaining to people is that I'm not this ginormous flamboyant gay man, in fact, me and a TON of gay men and women arent even in the same galaxy as that. 

This has led me to greatly dislike the ""gay culture"" because it in no way shape or form represents me. I will even go as far to say that this is why gay rights is such a fight, because there are idiots out there who think this is how we all act when in fact 99% of us live lives or act in ways that are indistinguishable from any other normal straight person. 

The day we get the world to realize we are no different then them is the day we win our rights. And I'm sorry but the gay rights movement is not helping that stereotype at all, if anything it only serves as the fuel to perpetuate more hate"

For the record, I know a teacher in college who a few months after the semester ended and the grades were given out went out with a student. That was okay. At that point they were just two consenting adults who happened to have met in class -- but nothing started while he was in her class.

CalvinDehaze,vfx,1391112847.0,"I've been saying this for a couple of years now. VFX artists shouldn't be fearing China and India. It's not as cheap as you think and the quality is shit. Then when the quality gets better, the people want more pay, as you would expect. Outsourcing works for low-skill labor, like manufacturing, where you do the same thing over and over with no real way of doing it better. Roto and paint takes some skill, and you can get faster and better at it.
  
VFX artists need to be worried about tax breaks in Canada, the UK, and Australia, and New Zealand because those places are taking jobs that you, as an American VFX artist, will have a hard time to get. If you're in LA, consider moving to NY. Their tax breaks got extended for 3 years and they currently need more artists."

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1391112866.0,"I read some other guy try to make a non-offensive distinction in PurplePillDebate that was interesting.

He tried to make it less about a ""woman's value"" to men in a relationship, but rather ""fertility's value"". 

To be honest, I'm not perfectly sure how much social and biological biases have over our conscious decisions on this matter, but logically this ""hard line"" is mainly in relation to that.

If that's the only objective, conscious concern, then you might want to know if your husband wants children or what his thoughts are on that, because these are things I would seriously consider from a guy's perspective when thinking of my partner's age.

Factors I also considered are:

- adoption
- surrogacy
- technology
- legacy; if I have other ways of leaving one, aside from children. E.g. donations, organization/business, invention, ideology/religion, artificial intelligence (I'm not kidding), etc.

See how you can find out more or work together on that. I think see a lot of people, including myself in the past, avoid these kinds of topics because they're awkward, non-romantic, or other stupid reasons.

As for less logical, baser concerns... if both of you are having a satisfactory sex life, he's less likely to get anxious. I know that I'm less ""anxious"" when I'm not sexually frustrated. It's not even something a lot of men consciously think about unless they take time for self-awareness.

As for the rest, I agree with everyone else on ""exercise and stay healthy"". It's advice everyone should follow anyway."

Why not develop that for the Wii U and have it as a launch title. This was another big problem, there was simply no reason to buy one. There were no games for it.

'Cause distress'... for a number of people, saying that humans exist due to natural selection as opposed to special creation is a cause for distress. Does that count? Their distress is certainly real, but maybe they're not the right group of people for hate speech laws to help them in that fashion.

The two angles im not seeing presented, which i firmly believe:

1. Google doesnt want to make handsets - it aquires hardware companies like Motorola because they have patents that help protect it in it's forever war with Apple.  Motorola is an old company (name comes from Motor-Victrola) and the wealth of patents will help. And of course they are keeping the best talent for their Android OS.   They're an information company and having OSes (Chome for desktop and Android for mobile) enables them to gather and present data better.

2. Lenovo is up to something.  This past week they both bought up IBM's existing x86 server devision for a couple billion and now they are grabbing the Motorola (cellular) from Google.. who else makes phones, PCs and servers and lives in Cupertino?  That's my thought - Lenovo wants to be the new Apple.  Just watch in the coming years.

I'm going to be addressing tripletrules as well probably, at least in regards to suggesting that people not see doctors for medical conditions.

Firstly, are you interested in being unbanned? I know you've had run-ins with mods a couple of times but overall you seem to be able to remain respectful. Some people aren't interested in having bans lifted and some people do want them lifted.

Though I remain doubtful of most/all claims of demonic possession, it is an element of Christianity. It should not be weird to see people mention things like that here. The only real issue I see with your posts here is that you dismiss that wholecloth as dangerous. 

What I see as dangerous is the part where tripletrules seemingly dismisses a medical solution but not the suggestion that it might still be a possession (I know how that reads). I think I get where you were coming from and we've had to deal with similar things from other people as well.

I know the reply won't work while you are banned but you can respond by PM to me or through moderator mail. Mod mail would be best I think but I would leave that choice up to you."

 ""however stating the facts about African-Americans seeming to be much more violent than non-African-Americans is not racist at all.""

We don't really not know anything, we just don't know anything as a fact. Our information *suggests* that blacks are more likely to commit for crimes, but doesn't confirm it.

Four were consumed by dragons, which destroyed them, and three were recovered by Sauron, with the most recent being the Ring of the Longbeards, recovered from Thrain II by Sauron during his time as the Necromancer.

The 9ers/Cowboys hate comes from when I was a pre-teen kid who *loved* his Browns and would defend them to the ends of the Earth. The 9ers and the Cowboys were the teams that the frontrunning little twerps in my grade school and middle school would root for. ""Why do you like the *Browns*, they suck"" the little pissants would chant, and  I never had a comeback. They *did* suck, but that didn't matter to me. They were my team, win or lose, and I've never looked back. 

1989 to 1996 (ages 6-13) were my formative years in football. I was learning everything I could, and either the 9ers or the 'Boys won 6/8 of those Super Bowls. I couldn't stand them. That jealousy never really subsided, and even though neither team has really been very good until the 9ers recent resurgence, the hate that grew inside of me as a pre-teen is still there with me as an adult.

s-mores,WorldofTanks,1391113826.0,"Sorry, didn't mean to sound pretentious. Basically, multicore is not the be-all-end-all of performance when it comes to MMOs and especially World of Tanks. People generally think that you can ""just give"" a game multicore support and it will magically increase performance by a lot, and adding more cores would make it even better. That's not the case.

Basically in the case of World of Tanks you'd have to rewrite the Big World engine. Not add to it, start from scratch.

Think of it like this, you'd *like* multicore to have a scheduler create a bunch of little tasks, divide them to cores to be done, then utilize them when the calculation is done. In a linear program like a game this isn't very easy, you can't just unbundle stuff like the HUD from other 3D calculations or anything else, it's a bunch of interconnected math that depends on each other and it's then all bundled up for the GPU to handle its bit. Not to mention the scheduler has to guess what calculations will take how long in 10^-15 second bursts. Adding to all of *this*, you'd have to redesign the system from the ground up with a *specific processor in mind*, for example I be ieve World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria gets heavy advantage of Intel threading. Adding to *this* you'd be stuck doing work for a year and only then getting to where they are now.

You could take some stuff like audio and DOM parsing, but that's relatively minor.

For general problems about multicore performance I can recommend reading [here](http://www.csee.usf.edu/~rhyman/Projects/Architecture/multicorePerformance.pdf).

**TL;DR** multicore is not magic, way too much work, no substantial gains straight off."

I would agree with you if this was 6.75 still, but with the several buffs ignite got over the past few patches, it really is a potent DoT skill.  

There is value in burst damage, for sure, but ignite provides more overall damage and more utility overall (6% additional slow and a longer duration) and generally scales better with levels until you hit level 11, at least. 

Also, I can't count the number of times I've had a target get away only to die to ignite.  "

Two feature request:

1. Most of the time, switching between inbound and outbound routes by swiping is easy. However, for some buses there are more than two directions. For example, the 25 has three inbound and two outbound directions. To 90% of people riding them, they are effectively the same bus. Not only does this make for an annoying process of switching through them (if the first outbound route is selected and I want to see the last inbound route, it takes four swipes to get there), but it also may not show me the next available bus at a glance.

    It would be nice to group the inbound routes together and the outbound roots together if you live and work where they are the same.

2. A setting to automatically guess which direction you're likely to be going. Not everyone would want this, but for me, I *never* want to see inbound times when I'm downtown, and I *never* want to see outbound times when I'm not.

Anyway, thanks for adding Buffalo, and keep improving the app!

jianadaren1,AskReddit,1391113948.0,"While you're appear to be right on most of it, you've made some errors regarding the effects of buying, renting, and changing property values.

First, even if you can afford it, buying is not necessarily a better financial deal than renting. The white GI's were not made better-off *because* they could buy, but because of all of their subsidized benefits. Similarly the black GI's were not made worse-off *because* they were forced to rent but because of a lack of benefits, neighborhood restrictions and other forms of discrimination. Given equal opportunities it's just as easy to build equity when renting compared to owning (the big different being that when you own you build equity by paying down your mortgage and when you rent you build equity by saving and investing in different assets).

Secondly, while you're absolutely right that the existence and creation of white-only neighborhoods was bad for blacks, their subsequent ""blockbusting"" was unambiguously good for blacks, and hit whites worse in terms of equity loss. This is because the property values in those areas plummeted which is terrible for owners and sellers (mostly white), but excellent for buyers (mostly black).

You work at Amazon.. everybody knows Amazon, feed into that a little.. it may be a normal thing in your area for people to work at Amazon, but for the rest of the on-line world that alone makes you a little unique and cool, even if you're just running around the warehouse filling boxes.

Add some spacing to your favorites so it reads better.. it's kind of a jumble now.   White space is your friend.

Every other section (except your six) really needs at least one more sentence if not an entire additional paragraph."

The laws essentially provided a legal basis for justice systems to work against homosexuals.

They have done things like tricking gay teens on the internet to show up, then tortured them on camera and showing the video to the victim's friends and family. They've participated in ""corrective rape"" of lesbian women. And not only do they not have any consequences for their acts, but the victims have no way to seek help in forms of support or protection. Several have committed suicide citing such events as the reason. Even if they survive, they're going to have trust issues for the rest of their lives.

Here's a teaser:

&gt;If you must know, I do support sex selective abortions. There should be a quota on the number of male children allowed to be born. 1 boy for every 20 women should be sufficient to prevent inbreeding. Violence would plummet, rape would be practically non-existent, the environmental problems that come with their toxic masculinity (no more classic cars, no more big engines) would disappear. It's a perfect scenario. Once we cut the cancer that is masculinity from our society, we'll finally be able to start progressing forward.

Stat Padders are people, who play only really good tanks to up their Winrate. These, for example, let new players achieve better Winrates than normally in other tanks. Simply because these tanks do pretty good Gameplay wise.

I like the time I go for a few reasons.  First, I can plan ahead and gauge how I'm feeling over the day, while thinking about what I might like to do.  Second, I actually enjoy when it isn't dead and empty.  I really like the encouragement other gym members give eachother, and my favourite staff work at night as well.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1391114328.0,"your post raises a lot of red flags in my mind, and the fact that your's is a new account doesn't help much with that.

you say that he is in his 6th relationship. at 19. how is that even possible? dating someone in high school for two weeks does not make it a relationship. having sex with 6 guys doesn't make those relationships. a relationship takes time and effort; it requires you to get to know the other person more than physically. i honestly don't know how anyone could say that they've had 6 ""relationships"" at 19 years old.

however, let's set that aside.

&gt; I'm not completely out yet, so I look masculine and have ""masculine"" interests like sports.

so by this, i take it that once you ""come out"" you will no longer have to look masculine or have ""masculine interests."" good for you. you've obviously been reading the gay man's handbook and know that once you declare your love of cock you can no longer be into football except to comment on how their asses look hot.

&gt; We have yet to have actual sex, but we have explored each other's bodies and have a desire to have sex soon. I am pretty inexperienced sexually (he is far more experienced) and in the little experience I've had, I've bottomed most of the time.

you don't say if you have bottomed because you enjoy being the bottom, or because your partner(s) have been tops and wouldn't let you explore being a top, or what. do you like to bottom? is that your preferred position?

&gt; where I am in bed is of little significance to me.

i think you are the first gay man (or potentially gay man, since you are still interested in sports!) who I've ever heard say, ""what i do in bed is not significant."" you have no preference? really?

&gt; We have also had some deep and meaning conversations and he pointed out to me that I am kind of soft. Looking at myself, I have come to the same conclusion as I open up a lot more about my insecurities, flaws and emotions than he does. He expressed that this isn't an issue and that he loves me anyway. He also said that there is nothing wrong with showing some softness, but I should also show some dominance.

ok, so you being ""soft"" isn't an issue but it's an issue. ""really, honey, i don't mind that you are so emo but could you stop being so emo?""

there is nothing at all wrong with showing emotion, opening up about your insecurities and flaw, or whatever. *especially* with someone who says he loves you. that is part of what a relationship is about.

now about dominance. what does he mean by dominance and what do you mean by dominance? is he talking about the Dom/sub lifestyle? fetishes? is he asking you to take on more of a ""leader"" role in the relationship and begin making more decisions?

&gt; I assume emotionally, he wants me to be more sure of myself and portray more self-confidence (which I am working on) but could it also mean more?

ok, here's the thing. you are ""assuming"" what he wants. why don't you instead *""ask""* him what he wants. then decide if it's something that you want to do.

this is a relationship. you have a say in what happens. but you need to know what he wants and what you want.

i get the feeling that since this is your first ""relationship"" that you don't really know what you are doing or how to approach it. which is fine. but you need to express yourself. tell him what you are feeling. ask him what he is looking for. ask him how he is feeling. you are an adult. you can make your own decisions and you can decide what you want."

GhostdadUC,CollegeBasketball,1391114461.0,"You should definitely stay cheering for the Bearcats.  We play a hard nosed, in your face, aggressive defense that only San Diego State can say they even compare to.  We held Pitt, who is averaging 75.8 points a game, to 43 points.

Now onto the history of the Bearcats.  You first might be wondering what exactly is a Bearcat and how did we become to be named Bearcats.  Well, it all started in a football game against the University of Kentucky Wildcats way back in the early 1900's.  We did not have a nickname at the time so cheerleaders at the game came up with a clever chant yelling, ""you might be the Wildcats but we have the Baehr-cat"" in reference to one of our players whose last name was Baehr.  This later turned into people calling us the Bearcats a few laters in a paper and the name stood the test of time.

Now a Bearcat is also the name of an animal as well and a pretty cool one at that.

[Here is our mascot Bearcat](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Cincinnati_Bearcat.png).  Fun fact about the Bearcat animal is that when the females are in heat they actually smell like popcorn!

We have some great rivalries with crosstown rival Xavier, the University of Louisville, and a non-spoken about basketball rivalry with Ohio State.  

Xavier is a private-religious school located 2 miles away from the University of Cincinnati campus.  You might have heard about the rivalry in the news a couple years back because of a brawl that broke out between the players of both squads during an XU blowout victory.  We absolutely hate these guys and this rivalry is one of the biggest in the nation.  The entire city stops moving when this game is going on and bragging rights with your friends, co-workers, relatives and enemies are on the line for the year.

Louisville is more of a friendly rivalry.  We don't have them but we don't necessarily like them either.  We have been in the same conference for something like 40+ years even though we have both moving confereces non-stop.  We are very similar schools with both being located in larger cities on the Ohio river.  We aren't their #1 rival and they aren't our #1 rival but we still love to play each other.

OSU, and OSU fans might disagree with this, is a basketball rival of Cincinnati.  OSU flat out refuses to play us in basketball.  Mick Cronin and our AD's have tried to schedule non-conference games with them and they were told that it is never going to happen.  It's crazy to think that the two best basketball programs in a state as big as Ohio with as many Division 1 schools as Ohio have only played something like 6 times in their history with 4 of them coming in the NCAA tourney when they were forced to play against each other.

Now onto the basketball side of things.  Cincinnati is often considered to be one of the top 20 programs in college basketball.  The greatest player ever to play the game of college basketball played at Cincinnati in Oscar Robertson.  He averaged 33.8 points a game and won the national scoring award in each of his 3 seasons at UC.  We have 2 national titles, 6 final four appearances and have been to the tournament 27 times.  

We were one of the dominant programs of the 90's-early 00's until our head coach was forced to resign.  Our current coach, Mick Cronin who's father is a Cincinnati legend, took up the head coaching job after a few interim guys and began the rebuilding process.  The rebuilding process was so difficult that we actually had current Philadelphia Eagles outside linebacker Connor Barwin playing forward for us one season.  After a lot of patience and hardwork we are finally starting to see the end of the tunnel of the rebuilding project and Cincinnati, although not quite back to what we were earlier, is back out of the dumpster and a respectable program again.

If you like heart, great defense, and competitive fire than Cincinnati is definitely the team for you.

FrankieSucks,Wicca,1391114676.0,"Aside from splitting the overhead, I'm not really seeing the difference between a workshop and a coven meeting.  I guess as long as the cost is reasonable, it's not a huge deal. I would just hate to see Wiccan teachers getting rich off of their students.  

One of the things I really like about Wicca compared to more ""New-Age"" spirituality teachings is that Wiccans very rarely charge for teaching.  I believe knowledge should be shared freely.  Seeking money or donations for services is what has lead to the downfall of many mainstream religions.

Like I said before though, for services like tarot reading or handfasting or anything like that I have no problem with people charging, but I don't like the idea of charging for knowledge."

That's all I really want from an audience -- they don't have to love it; they just have to be exposed to it.

I am from Wisconsin, in the fox valley. Its snowy and cold, but I can't imagine living anywhere else. I'd like to add this to my collection because I usually gravitate toward dark colors (black, burgundy, dark reds) and I want to expand my horizons and go for some brighter colors, something out of my comfort zone :) as far as my skill level, I'd say I'm somewhere I'm the middle. I'm not super skilled but I have an idea of how to make myself look pretty good. I have lots of room for improvement. "

positmylife,relationships,1391114941.0,"Thanks! You're so nice :) sometimes I get mad but I try to calm myself down and think of what my goal is before I respond. Getting pissed off never leads to good conversations where my points are made in a way that encourages learning or cooperation. If my goal is to act like an adult and have a conversation, I have to resist the urge to get angry and throw reason out the door. Emotions just like to get in the way sometimes. 

The thing about disorders is that they need to be inhibiting your life. That can take a lot of different forms. Despite our best efforts, since every case is different, clinicians still have a little trouble consistently agreeing on a diagnosis. That's why the DSM keeps getting revised every few years. For all of the things we know about the brain and mental disorders, there's still a lot we don't know. Thankfully, we know how to treat a lot of problems, but I personally believe we need to keep researching and learning because we can do better. For your case, it doesn't sound like it's inhibiting your life a lot. I mean, if you really start to think something is wrong, go see a doctor. I don't expect you to lay out your private life on the internet, but what you said is a little too vague to really know or suspect anything from. Also remember I'm not an expert, just a very interested student who just finished my abnormal psych course. My teacher actually has her own practices and works with people who have mental disorders, so I feel like I have really good information to draw from, but I'm not at her level. Maybe someday though... :)

PacoBedejo,Libertarian,1391114943.0,"I wouldn't judge US economics based on what happens in California. $15/hr in Indiana is reserved for skilled labor and even low-level engineering. I only make $50k/yr as a Design Engineer/Project Manager. For reference, my 4 bedroom home on a cul-de-sac in a decent neighborhood 4.5 miles from my job in a city of 300k people cost me $90k.

mel11ism,AdviceAnimals,1391114963.0,"I always struggled in Math. In high school, I had a teacher that would change the way she was teaching if we weren't getting it. She would take individual time and teach you an entirely different way of solving a problem if we were struggling. I realized then that it wasn't that I sucked at math, but that most of the teachers I had didn't really care.

A little bit off topic but in regards to the same teacher... One day I wrote my test problems wrong. Instead of just failing me, she went through each one and made sure the work was correct and the answer was correct for the problem I had. In her words ""I'm not going to punish you for a mistake anyone can make. You know how to solve them""

Seriously, the best math teacher I have had

Apolik,Fitness,1391114964.0,"&gt; I thought that being tired was because I lacked a physical condition, so I tried to start running and doing sports which pretty much left me dead every time I did it, which isn't very surprising if your body does everything to preserve calories.
