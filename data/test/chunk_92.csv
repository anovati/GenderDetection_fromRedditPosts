brotherbock,IWantToLearn,1390975814.0,"&gt; I would say that bolting after you knock them over may be the best option.

No argument here. What I'm saying about Judo is that it focuses, after throwing, on various kinds of pinning more than on locks or gaining position from which striking can be done (i.e. position without all your limbs used for pinning)...which is not something you can run away from, as you haven't done any damage. You stop the pin, he gets up. 

The BJJ I've studied, which granted may not be similar at all to what others have, leaves easy openings for damage. Not necessarily permanent, but enough to allow an escape."

That being said, with those stats, we should rethink our drone strike program, or at least how its implemented. After all, I think we should MINIMIZE civilian casualties while also minimizing our own casualties. 

Also, as for the last part, you kinda have to. Look, at this point I think we should get out of that part of the world too, but we can't just drop everything or there will be chaos, it's kind of a 'you broke it you bought it"" situation. 

We went into Afghanistian for Bin Laden, we got him, mission accomplished, now let's get out. But we have to get out in an orderly fashion.

I just believe the world is more complicated than the simple terms you put it in. You're focusing on one aspect of it, and it's a troublesome aspect, I admit it. And you're right to be concerned. But I just think there's more going on than just that, you kinda gotta look at the big picture of ""if we leave, what's gonna happen? who will be in charge? will they be a threat to us? etc."" War is complicated, politics is complicated, diplomacy is complicated, nation building is complicated, everything is complicated.

AdamColligan,AskScienceDiscussion,1390976191.0,"I think this partly goes down to your choice of how to define what reality is. One way of understanding reality is to say that something exists, or occurs, only if you can tell the difference between a universe in which it is there and a universe in which it is not there. So if there is no test for when the atom decayed, then it is a meaningless question to ask whether it decayed at Time 1 or Time 2.

From this perspective, your question can be seen as a version of ""can God make a rock so heavy he can't lift it?"", even though that wasn't your intention. You are basically saying, ""if I set up an event where you can't tell what happened (there is no test after the event that can distinguish between two possibilities), is there any way to tell what happened?""  You are invoking time travel as a special workaround: i.e., ""if I destroy information, can you then un-destroy it and bring it back to the future by using a time machine""?  But I think you're just unwittingly adding lead to the rock and rope to the pulley."

It just seems like a very sad and dystopian world to me. No offense of course. But since you asked...

I'm typically a drummer and don't often venture into the other instruments, and so I've only ever played one or two of these song/instrument combos for this week's challenges. The whole point of this thing is to encourage people to be engaged with the game right? Encourage people to not let that plastic guitar get dusted over.

Literally none of my scores would have happened without this challenge, because I wouldn't have played them. By forcing people to only pursue a single instrument in a song, you're vastly limiting the pool of participants in each instrument. Participants are incentivized to only do the instrument that they are best at, instead of taking a stab and having fun with other instruments/charts. I think this will have the opposite effect of what you're intending and create a more limited and a harsher competition for everyone. For example, how many people are going to submit any pro scores when the competition will necessarily coagulate around the legacy instruments?"
elerico,askgaybros,1390976279.0,"At the end of the day, what we think about this is pretty irrelevant. Just because some of us would be ok and some of us wouldn't doesn't really change the way it makes you feel. I think this is something that you can reasonably get upset about.

heres_a_llama,Judaism,1390976281.0,"&gt;Satmar and MO

The original question grouped all Orthodox together and asked me how Conservative's rejection of Reform differed from Orthodoxy's rejection of Conservative. The ""other"" in this case is the movements, not subgroups within a movement. I don't see how differences between MO and Satmar are a relevant example here: they're both Orthodox groups who would reject Conservative conversions for being Conservative. 

I don't know of a single Orthodox beit din in the US (and yes, you can accuse me of being Americentric!) who would even look at a Conservative conversion on a case by case basis to see if the necessary rituals were done and thus accept it. They wouldn’t look to see if it was done well, or done to their standards, but rather simply if they were done. And if they were, to accept the conversion.

That’s what Conservative Judaism does to Reform and Reconstructionist conversion.  We don’t agree with their understanding of halakah, we don’t judge their execution … we just see if the rituals were done. Which is why I said, ""we don't say ""All Reform and all Reconstructionist are invalid conversions in our eyes by virtue of being done in Reform/Reconstructionist communities."" And why I also said, “It doesn't matter if the period of study was according to Reform or Reconstructionist theology to us, doesn't matter if the composition of the beit din are Reform/Reconstructionist, etc.”

To specifically contrast with the Orthodox of “if it’s not our beit din, it’s not valid.” Because the Orthodox beit din would consist of rabbis the Orthodox community found suitable to sit there. Which necessarily means theology and lifestyle. I don't know why this part had to be stated because it seems obvious to me and common knowledge about batei din wrt geirus.

I don't know what more to say at this point then that I mentioned theology and composition of the beit din in my original answer, thus specifically highlighting the differing POVs in the halakhic frameworks of the movements. The reality of today is that Orthodox say to non-Orthodox converts, “if it’s not our beit din, it’s not valid.” Because you're not Orthodox and don't hold to our standards.

And to whomever is downvoting in this thread: I’m a mod and can see the voting before it’s viewable to everyone. Stop. It’s uncalled for.

I'm really confused what that has to do with the rest of this discussion. That's a complete non-sequitur.

&gt;That being said, the ads on Runescape.com are loud, obtrusive, and inhibit my browsing experience.

Then you have a few options: you can use an adblocking extension of some kind (there are several available, for various browsers), though IIRC that might be against Terms of Use; you can complain to Jagex about specific ads or general types of ads that especially bother you (if they're getting ads through Google, then they can ditch specific ads that Jagex doesn't want on their site; I see small businesses, like webcomics, do this all the time to avoid popup or auto-playing video ads.), and/or you can stop paying for or using the product that comes with the ads (in this case, Runescape.com). And you can complain about said ads elsewhere, like here - that's probably the *most* indirect method of dealing with the issue, but it still holds *some* merit."

You can see the top of the Wrigley Building on the left, that tower poking up on the other side of the two rooftops past the Marriott. 

Anyway the Hancock is about 10 more blocks from this and has a number of other buildings in the way for a shot at this angle. The Allerton is only three or four blocks from the Marriott and has a pretty great view of this angle from its upper floors.

Second, you asked about breath ability in fabric then you moved to shoes. Remember, shoes are made from leather with is a SKIN and clothes are made from wool/cotton/whatever which are FABRICS.

Now, let's take this for example put on a disposable plastic glove for like an hour. Give yourself time and your hand will get sweaty. BAM that's an example of poor breath ability. 

Ok so when you're dressing for winter the general consensus is that you want a BREATHABLE AND TIGHT first layer. Then a LOOSER second layer then a WATERPROOF/WEATHERPROOF third outer layer.

Your first layer is BREATHABLE so a fabric similar like cotton. Wicks moisture AWAY from your sweaty body. The second layer is a LOOSER and WARMER fabric. So wool, this second layer will then allow warm air to pass through your second layer and your sweat will remain off your body so that you can sweat more (sweat cools your body). So your third layer is WATERPROOF/WEATHERPROOF this will be heavy duty fabrics, most likely man made fabrics that do very well against weather. 

Now on to shoes, you basically cannot get rid of foot dampness/slight wetness. In fact, you DO NOT want a breathable fabric when it comes to your feet. Which is why most socks are WOOL. It traps your sweat inside the sock instead of getting the shoe wet. It gets damp though, which is why we use shoe trees.

It started being significant when I was around 12/13 which is when the abuse slowly became apparent to me (along with a growing sense of self-discovery). I began to recognise why I'd always felt like something was off/wrong, that I never belonged with any of them (immediate or extended FOO), and the urgent need to get away before it caused more damage--unfortunately it took about another ten years before I truly could escape for various reasons.

But 12/13 was also the age that I met the best friend who helped me get through those horrible years, and has stayed by my side even though I was the worst possible person I could ever imagine myself being up until the last few years when I finally managed to get away and go NC.

Still, early awareness and escape haven't prevented me from lots of long-term damage. It's hard trying to figure out how to live normally. I'm so conscious of what's what in terms of normalcy versus fleas, but sometimes the fleas get out of control and I've yet to fully figure out how to manage them."

Also yes. I think that for men, creepy is more about emotional/social discomfort than a threat of physical harm.  A *really* creepy girl might stick her hand down a guys pants in a club (or put a guys hand down her pants), or make some other unwanted sexual advances.  But I think that if a man felt physically threatened by a woman (she seemed violent, or may become violent and attack him) he would more likely refer to her as psycho or crazy, not creepy.

I remember seeing a post a few months ago of a guy punching a girl after she attempted to kick him in the balls.  Theoretically he wasn't wrong, but it was still unnecessary and the comments on it disgusted me.

Yeah she begins to get the joke later, but do you think reddit is ignoring it due to misogyny?  no, they're ignoring it due to the fact they love to hate people, to find someone to be angry about.  Clues are constantly ignored just to state the obvious, or to just get the top posting.  By pointing out the obvious and ignoring the actuality they can do that.

But, just because the comments are calling her a cunt isn't misogynistic, it is a sexist slur, but we would also use dick if it were a man, or asshole (more gender-neutral i suppose, but more likely used for a guy).

Also, the fact remains it wasn't a guy doing it, it was a woman.  Trying to make this about misogyny is not going to do anything, and possibly slightly misplaced.  It's circumstantial to say if it were a man there would be less criticism, because sadly there is no proof.  I'm not sure i could disagree, but by saying it's obvious that's what would happen you prove your own bias."

Anyway, some general guidelines are get a good barber that knows how to cut asian hair. If you're going to a place like super/mega cuts it's probably not gonna be what you need.

Second, accept that your hair is going to suck without maintenance. You'll need special layering and texturing and probably special products to make your hair do exactly what you want. Because if you don't, your hair will just do whatever it wants, and it wants a bowl.

Third, asian hair is durable, so don't be afraid to try things. Take care of your hair so that it doesn't get jacked up, but generally your hair can take a good beating and look good after a shower.

Love the idea of Navi being the same fairy who helped the failed hero. Though I'll be honest, I kinda lost it near the end.

Why is Link^C defeating Ganon when Link^B already did? In fact, why is Link^C in the Adult timeline at all? The Adult Era is the one where Link awakens the sages and defeats Ganon, isn't it? The Hero in this timeline doesn't exist after Zelda sends him back.

And I'm not convinced that bad guys come in groups any more than good guys do. I have never been swayed by the 'his friends will get you' argument about any kind of art/technique, like I said. If you're outnumbered, you're outnumbered. And the people I've met personally who have studied arts that claim to be great against numbers have never, themselves, been in a fight against those numbers. Apparently one of their masters always has, or something. And he dominated. Or something. Chi power death touch something something.

Fizjig,SaltLakeCity,1390977514.0,"So I had the clever idea of proposing to my wife on New Year's Eve to ring in 2010 as the ball dropped at midnight.  

We ended up downtown, had a nice dinner and intended to walk the 6 blocks down to the Gateway for the New Years celebration. I was going to do it there. 

It was rather cold that night, snowing and generally pretty crappy out, but we braved the weather and hoofed it down there. 

As we approached we noticed it was deserted and most of the lights were off. It was about 11:30 at this point. 

We ended up hoofing it back up the hill to where I parked and tried to quickly find somewhere else. My wife works downtown, and we were freezing, so drove over to her place of employment with about 10 minutes to spare. 

So here we are at her work. (She manages an adult novelty shop) about the last place I want to propose to her. I seriously considered postponing, but I had already psyched myself up for it, so when everyone stepped outside to see the fireworks I pulled her behind the counter, watched the clock change to 11:59, and dropped to one knee. 

She goes, ""what the hell are you doing?""

At that point instead of answering I pulled out the ring and asked her to marry me.

Now she flat out denies it to this day, but it caught her so off guard she slapped the crap out of me. Right across the face.

It was not the reaction I was expecting. 

All I could muster was, ""Is that a yes?""

It was. 

Take a lesson from me. Don't propose downtown. You may end up like me asking for my wife's hand in marriage behind the counter of a porn shop. 

Romantic.

We have been together for 9 years married for 4. I wish you good luck, congrats, and I hope you end up as happy as we are.

AdamColligan,askscience,1390977704.0,"I disagree with what /u/tin_can_conspiracy said earlier. 

Sound already *is* energy (or, rather, energy is a property of sound waves that varies with their frequencies and amplitudes).  What you seem to be asking about is the conversion of sound into other forms of energy, like electricity, heat, or the kinetic energy of a large object. 

In that case, the answer would be ""yes"" -- if you use a tool to convert sound energy into some other form, then the energy of the ""sound"" -- which involves the sound wave's ability to push molecules of air around, will be reduced. This is actually what is happening all the time when sound gets ""absorbed"" by a wall. The sound wave compresses and expands the material in the wall, and the sound on the other side is less intense because some of the wave's energy has been converted into friction/heat in the wall. 

The wind farm analogy is actually a good one, but for the opposite reason. Wind farms *do* in fact have an impact on the wind itself: they take some of its energy, meaning that it is actually to some small degree ""less windy"" in total on the downwind side of the wind farm. "

I have a script that requires me to test the accessibility of a database before running certain queries. Invoke-command lets me run a tnsping command in a separate session, which lets me get around the default timeout setting of the tnsping command. With the -AsJob parameter, I can use a while loop to periodically check the results of a tnsping without waiting for it to actually resolve. This means that if a database is actually down, I can have the PS script ignore the tnsping if it fails to resolve after a few seconds, rather than waiting 60+ (or whatever the default timeout is) seconds. This is particularly useful because tnsping doesn't have a customize-able timeout setting"

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390977830.0,"I see you deleted your previous version of this comment, so here's a copy pasta i was working on.

Yes, and you posted links on the matter, the problem is those links make various assumptions about human nature and the like that I don't think that are true. The problem is, all of those links about human behavior forget one thing, they talk about how people act NOW, with a state enforcing order! One of them you posted literally made the argument that because not a lot of people commit crime now, they wouldn't in an ancap society, but the reason many people dont commit crime now, is because there's a government keeping order. Either they don't act violently because they fear government, or because they don't have to fear more people acting violently.

I'm gonna use prison as an example here, since I think it's relevant. It's been said our prison system, instead of reforming people, screws them up royally and makes them less able to live in civilized society. Why is this? Because when you're in prison, you can't be nice and civil, you're in with all the bad dudes, and to survive, you need to be bad too. So you end up, instead of rehabilitating, becoming more violent, and less civil. Well, I could see, in absence of government, a ripple effect going on here. More people would become more violent, which would cause even more people to become violent, and then society falls apart. Well, unless you have a monopoly on violence to provide protection for everyone, but then you just have another government. Which brings me to my next point, if I recall, one of the videos also made the argument that because businesses currently make their money via non violent means, they would continue to do this in a an anarcho capitalist society. This makes the same fallacy. It takes behavior that happens in a society with a state, and says that without a state, they'll still act non violently. This is not necessarily true. Without a state, there's nothing to stop for profit corporations from using violence to achieve their goals. The second they lose their competitive edge, I could see them killing off their competition. Or killing them off before they even become competitive to begin with, which once again, brings us back to a monopoly on violence.

That being said, I'm not swayed at all. I looked at some of your sources and my views are completely and utterly unphased, because they all seem to keep making the same fallacious arguments over anf over again. Anarcho capitalism requires that in absence of the state, people will actually act civilly, and in accordance with the NAP and other libertarian principles....which isn't necessarily true. At all. Even if private police forces maintained order, it would still be by force, and at the expense of somes' liberty. And then there's nothing to stop the private police forces, or whoever is controlling them, to use them for their own ends.

The problem that makes the state corrupt is the human element. The fact that humans are corruptible, the fact that when they have power, many will abuse it. This doesn't go away in an anarcho capitalist world. People will at best, use the principles of anarcho capitalism for their own ends, and establish a pseudo government with the illusion of freedom, and at worst, there will be total chaos.

It's not that I don't understand your position, it's that I think it's naive and the responses I've seen on the matter make fallacious judgment calls on human nature that won't necessarily reflect reality."

We are the sum of both our facticity (the things true about us, our past) and our transcendence (what is not *yet* true of us, what we want the future to be). Don't let your facticity hinder your transcendence. What you are you are, the things you've done you've done, you can't change or deny that.

But neither can anyone else. The ONLY thing you can do now is to answer this question: what are you going to do *now*?

*Given what your past is*, what will you *choose* to do now? Your past does not determine your future. Options may be limited, but you still have choices. You are not only your past, you are also your plans for what you will be.

We're all in the same boat you are in, every one of us. Anyone who says they have 'no regrets' about what they've done is either a liar or isn't thinking too much. So just accept that you are human like everyone else and move on.

The monsters are great and can make a bidding war erupt to get the first spot.

Its a bit tricky to learn and teach just because chances are most gamers gave never seen the bidding mechanic and the wording in the manual can be a bit ambiguous.

Fun.

I haven't done it in about 12 years now, but when I was 13 or so I used to play an online game called Graal. Some people on the game had more rupees than I did, or admin accounts, or various things that I wanted to screw around with. They also had easily accessible profile pages that included email accounts.

Secret questions were notoriously easy to either guess or socially weasel out of people. Most people don't even remember putting it as a question, and when someone you've been casually talking to for a while says, ""Hey yeah I grew up in that area, went to school right near you at *x school*. You go there?"" You're not in the right mindset to think, ""Hey wait, he's asking what school I went to as a kid, that's my hotmail secret question!"" You're in the social ""Oh hey he might know my school, it's this one!"" mindset instead.

If you lived in the States, the secret questions often required a zip code as well, which were pretty easy to get. If you lived out of the states all you needed was the question.

Once I got their hotmail account I searched through histories and got forum accounts, game accounts, etc. Locked them out of everything to maximise the amount of time I had on the account, and then logged on and slowly transfered/traded away items to smurfs which then got re-traded a few times and found its way to my main.

I even had an admin account on one server and I just posed as that admin for a few days doing minor things here and there that weren't really that traceable. Eventually lost it when the original owner somehow resolved the situation, but had fun while it lasted.

As I type this out, I realize that I was probably a dick when I was 14. At the time I thought it was a lot of fun, nowadays I'd probably be thinking more about the 'good time' the other person is having.


Edit: But yeah, to answer your question, people would go through all of that because it's fun. To a certain mindset (Mine included) there's nothing more fun than breaking into things and getting places you shouldn't be able to get to. The only reason I *don't* do that these days is that I'm older and it's kind of illegal, and also that I kind of like people, and don't want to screw them over that way."

brotherbock,IWantToLearn,1390978590.0,"Oh, and a trick I learned about depression management: you may start to play the 'horrible future game', wherein you start to paint a bad picture of what the future will hold. It sounds something like this: ""My parents are going to find out about such and such, and then they'll hate me, and then my girlfriend will leave me, and I won't be able to find a job again, and I'll have to move out of my apartment, and...""

If you find yourself starting to play that game, an amazingly simple solution is to just write everything out. Make a chart. One column is titled ""Bad Things That Will Happen"" and the other is titled ""Causes"", where you write out *why* you think those bad things will happen.

It was told to me, and proved to be true, that as soon as you write it all down, you begin to see that it's not what's likely to happen at all...sometimes in fact what you're writing down will sound ridiculous to you. ""My parents would never do that to me...that's silly."" The key is, as simple as it sounds, just writing it out.

^ This is an issue. However, before you read the rest of this, try to clear your mind of any assumptions you've made or conclusions you've drawn (i.e. ""unable to let go of my past""). Trust me, ditching those thoughts, at least temporarily, will help you in the long run. 

&gt; the first girl I ever fell really hard for rejected me hard

It happens to everyone. The first step is trying to remove self-pity from your life. It is not her fault in any way that you have spent so many years on this. She has undoubtedly moved on. The only thing standing in the way of getting over this is you.

&gt; I've kind of just kept it all bottled up

^ This is when solving your own issue *becomes* the issue. The problem is no longer the girl, or the relationship, or even thinking about the relationship. The problem is that you have hyperfocused on the wrong fucking shit. 

Unfortunately, my advice is to seek a therapist. It might sound dumb right now, but if you want to be able to express your feelings without judgement, you need to talk to someone who's literally *paid* to help you through it. If you were only handling this for a few years, i'd say to ""just move on"" like the other commentors, but if you haven't been able to help yourself by now, it's better to get help early while you still have time in your twenties to enjoy it."

In 11th grade, a guy I was friends with got into a car accident and literally burned to death. It was pretty bad cuz we had argued the day he died. He had a girlfriend that was pregnant at the time too. 
Then later on in that same year, this kid that was in one of my classes passed out after wrestling practice and died. "

WalterFStarbuck,todayilearned,1390978785.0,"The F-35 really isn't the dog people make it out to be. And it owes its whole existence to the idea that the military needs to do more with less. It's a multirole fighter intended to replace a bunch of aircraft between the A/B/C variants. Common parts, maintenance schedules, and training between different roles and different branches should reduce costs significantly. 

People often tend to forget where the military is coming from in terms of funding. The military has been pushing to fewer different vehicles that can handle several roles rather than a lot of single-purpose ones. We could have a lot of simpler-to-design single-purpose aircraft, but it's going to get complicated for the end-user (the military) which drives up operating costs. These major multirole design programs cost a lot up front, but the entire point is to save money when they're put in operation.

People think they can point to huge costs of things like the F-22 and F-35 and then ignore the fact that they take a lot more design work and testing up front than a single-role vehicle. It can be a very cheap, effective program but it keeps getting thrown under the bus while it's still in development which just makes things worse. You can say you want the military to do more with less but you can't drag the F-35 out as an example because that's what you get when you tell the military to do exactly that."

theswigz,thelastofus,1390978878.0,"I think it's the feeling that you lose a part of the unique flavor that made the original so good (I hope that makes sense - it's late and I'm tired).

Sure,  we would probably play a sequel - but it wouldn't be the same. 
It wouldn't be like Uncharted, where you accept similar gameplay situations as a trade-off for fun and mysterious storytelling.  This story was different.  The depth of the characters and the way we experienced their struggles presented us with a journey that would be almost taken for granted if it were continued beyond what we have already seen (at least to me).

Sequels are great, but some stories should be left alone. Not because they weren't good enough (as we all know is not the case here), but because sometimes you need to let end be The End so the experience and everything it meant remains pure.   

While we can't play the game again for the first time, ending the story now preserves that sense of awe for us and let's us recall that first time - how we felt, what were thinking - each time we play through.  I feel like that is worth way more than a sequel."
BIG_BOOTY_men,CollegeBasketball,1390978886.0,"I guess that was a bit of an exaggeration, and 100 is an arbitrary cut off. What makes the #100 team a good win and the #101 not even count? The point I was trying to make is that if a top 25 loses to anyone outside the top 100, it's a very bad loss, and if you beat anyone outside the top 100, that's not an impressive win. My issue with SOS is that if one team beats the #1 and the #350 team, and another team beats #175 and #176, they have the same SOS when one team clearly played a tougher schedule. A team can have plenty of games against great opponents, but be penalized for playing extremely bad teams rather than just bad teams."

It was also super windy; snow was blowing everywhere and effecting my car a bit. I goto pass a semi hauling a front end loader, going about 110 km/h in the left lane, holding the wheel like crazy. Lots more force from those trucks in that wind then you would expect. I'm sketching halfway through passing this dude but at that point I wasn't going to chicken out, I almost made it. Get to a safe distance, try and get in other lane and I notice I'm kind of drifting. Keep on trying to correct my steering, but the rear end keeps on swaying. After trying to correct eventually I overcorrect and wind up starting to spin. Remember that semi I was passing? I was middle of the lane and it was coming, me perpendicular to the road but still with momentum. All my driving skills come together right then and I manage to get my car in the other lane and start slowing down (because I was going to want to check my pants). Sadly instead of coming to a full stop though I hit the ditch on the left hand side instead. Basically my message here is don't fuck around when you see black ice.

I know ins Hollywood, a movie's budget can be inflated by the time it spent in development limbo. 2006's Superman Returns had one of the biggest budgets ever, around $250 million. However, that cost includes all of the millions of dollars invested into different Superman projects through the 90s and early 00s. Scripts were written, sketches were drawn, and a Superman movie was almost started several times in that time span. All of the money spent on those false starts is attributed to Superman Returns, since all of that was technically the pre-production process that led to SR.

whoop_there_she_is,askseddit,1390979284.0,"Huh. I think jealousy happens to the best of us, it's an instinctual thing that probably stems from genetics and intrasexual selection and all that stuff you slept through in high school. To answer your question, though, it helps for me to take a step back and get a bigger picture of the issue instead of focusing on the emotion that's taking over at the moment.

Your bigger picture is this: you have a FWB, which is a very tricky relationship to balance. Sex changes your perception of a person, some people more than others. She obviously doesn't think of the situation as exclusive (and that's usually what FWB implies), so she's not doing anything wrong. 

So ask yourself- why shouldn't she have the right to talk to other guys? Touch other guys? Sleep with other guys? She's her own person, and if the roles were reversed, you'd hate it if your FWB became more connected and clingy to you when feelings aren't reciprocated. 

Be glad that she's not clingy, that she's independent, and that you can share a sex life with this person. You're not using her and she's free to leave the relationship at any time, so be grateful that both of you can share some good sex and also have lives on the side. "

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; What did you study? How familiar are you with praxeology?

Basically just econ 101.

&gt;Without using violence so that one gains at the expense of another, people peacefully contracting with each other for mutual benefit is exploitative. Right.

It can be when one party holds all the cards and the arrangement is basically ""accept my loaded terms of screw off and starve.""

&gt;And what system, do tell, offers something other than ""work or starve""? Where is this garden of eden where one does not need to produce to be able to consume?

Our current system, but replacing all our current social safety nets with a universal basic income at subsistence level. 

&gt;Ah, yes, their use of violence and predation is a sign of their dedication to higher moral causes, whereas someone providing someone with a good or service they want for mutual benefit is a sign of moral decay.

I don't really agree with this framing of the issue.

&gt;And you think it's working? Who enforces this constitution exactly?

It's a different branch of government to be fair.

&gt;And they plan on using the big bad government in an anarchistic society how exactly? And what does it matter if it's a corporation that gaining at the expense of everyone else or the state gaining at the expense of everyone else. Surely the problem is gaining at the expense of others in the first place!

They make their own government. Get rid of the power structure and elites will just find ways of creating new ones to legitimize their power.

&gt;If that's true, then surely the most sensible thing to do is to adopt a system where one can only gain themselves when they promote the well being of others.

I think this would require a bit of social engineering to accomplish. Which requires government (sorry, I don't think the free market's interests ALWAYS equal societal interests).

&gt;Property, by definition, is the right to exclude others from the use of property. That's not something unique to ""elites"". What's much worse than that though is when someone may deny someone their own resources.

What makes those resources their own to begin with? Government and social recognition backed up by the use of force? Correct?

&gt;Don't talk about ""elites"" when you're advocating a system where some people aren't held liable for actions that are crimes for every other person in society. That's privilege.

Do you really think that privilege would cease to exist in an ancap society? That's gonna be a hard sell.

&gt;Pff, so why does the market just get ""their only motives are profit and self interest"", but the state gets to be ""nuanced""? Is the market some kind of robot devoid of emotion? Why can't it be just as nuanced and complex?

This kind of goes back to my studies in political science, but the goals of businesses are profit. That's the big goal businesses are measured by. You can have idealistic goals, but they mean nothing if you can't turn as profit. On the other hand, governments can set forth their own goals that are not profit and follow through.

&gt;Perhaps you're over simplifying and vilifying your opposition. I mean, I don't assume that just because someone is working in the government that they are working by bad intentions. I think giving someone a free pass to commit whatever crimes they want will attract criminals, sure, but I don't assume that. In fact, I probably assume it less than most. Ever since I read Time Will Run Back, I don't even assume that dictators are motivated from motives of malice anymore. When you're stuck in a socialist system, purges and stuff actually do become a legitimate necessity for being able to stay alive and not be killed off by some other person for your rank. I don't assume that Stalin and Hitler killed millions because they enjoyed it, I see that as an inevitable outcome of the systems they were in.

Ok, so you understand the nuances about the state then. I also look at that kind of situation and am happy we live in a rather safe and secure society, one where I don't have to really fear for my life (aside when i go walking around my neighborhood, yeah, i live in a bad neighborhood lol). 

&gt;Honestly, I'd rather have a tyrant than a person who wants to use coercion for the good of others.

I STRONGLY disagree with this statement. Speaking of which, have you looked at North Korea lately? That's the face of tyranny. The guy just killed his uncle and his family for little apparent reason. 

&gt;How would you define the state? 

The government, or a body of people who make laws and execute them, hopefully for the good of society and not their own gain. 

&gt;What is the difference between a government and a bandit gang writ large?

Social acceptability.

&gt;Why is government necessary?

To achieve more positive results for humanity than cannot be reached otherwise. I think ultimately, first and foremost, it's for protection and setting up rules for people to follow, but I think it can also take on the role of providing for citizens when the markets dont do a good job. 

&gt;Should laws apply equally to everyone, including those in the government (i.e. is murder be just as illegal when it's committed by a mayor)?

Yes and no. I think politicians, in their private lives, cannot abuse power. However, I think in executing lawful duties that there is some leeway in what governments can do (in order to justify the likes of taxation and war, for example). 

&gt;What is the purpose of the law?

To regulate human interactions in order to bring about more positive results for society.

&gt;How important is ""the consent of the governed"" in your view?

Important. I think a government no one wants is an illegitimate one, and that if the government is only accepted because of its force, it's a tyrannical one. However, I also accept the fact that not everyone will always be happy with government, so I kind of believe that the majority of people should accept it. I would say that in theory you should always be able to leave the country, but I also recognize this is not a possibility because no many other countries would be willing to take you, and because until you guys get that sea steading thing going you're never gonna have the society you want.

That being said, I'd like to point out that this is exactly how I feel under a free market system. Thoerietically alternatives exist, theoretically, I could start my own business, but in practice, yeah, I'm stuck. The thing is though, I have more faith in the government to look out for my rights, given its nuanced intentions, rather than a for profit company that wishes to use and abuse me at the lowest bidder and then throw me away to die when i can't work any more. Heck, I see government as the only thing that stops that from happening."

I like the tempo so far, good, fast mixing keeping me engaged. Hoping that Voices is picking up the musical tempo. 

Musically, Sound of the Underground doesn't follow Voices. Going from the female sound and the piano to a male voice and a more aggressive sound seems sudden. Good transition though. 

I loved the transition to Project T! I also love The XX so that helps. :P Spinnin' records is my jam. I love those guys. I think the original mix is better than the Garrix remix but I also hate trap and am tired of the Animals drop redux. 

Wild Child transition is great. Bassjackers are my #1 favorite producers, probably tied with Lazy Rich. This song is only OK though, I would say that it is another instance in which light, melodic sounds were followed up by harsh, aggressive ones. This may confuse a dance floor. Perhaps build with melodic songs then move into more aggressive stuff later instead of switching back and forth?

The transition to Output was fantastic. Definitely adding this track to my list. 

The transition to Legacy is another example of feeling like something is missing when Output was mixed out. Also I'm sure you noticed this but you had the lows turned down. I like Legacy a lot though! Good choice. 

The transition into Kids was messed up. Work on the phrasing/cue points there. You could probably bring the vocals in sooner since there was no melody in Legacy and there was no kick in Kids. 

Mix out of Kids to Sunset was too sudden I think. The problem here is that it just sounds like a new song is playing rather than complementing the previous song. 

""I can't believe"" came out of nowhere and is too aggressive/dark to follow Starlight. 

Overall I would say to work on the fluidity of the mix. Keeping people dancing in a similar rhythm, giving them builds and drops and breakdowns to talk to their friends are important. More importantly, I think the song selection is good but the songs don't always complement each other and the overall flow of the mix seems to be all over the place, jumping from high energy to dark to airy vocals. 

Thanks again for giving me feedback, and I hope all of these thoughts help. Remember they're just my opinion :) "

Precisely. It's always advantageous to be able to teach a girl something as a way of asserting your superiority. Remember, hypergamy aims up.

&gt;My only real question is one of payment.

**Do not fucking pay for her ticket in.**

&gt;Paying $40 is no big deal to me, but paying $20 might be somewhat of a big deal to her

If she can't afford $20, then she shouldn't have agreed to go.

If you pay for ANYTHING on the first date, no matter how small, a woman will immediately begin measuring you up as a provider's. At that point, it's an uphill battle to get her back on the road to attraction.

Nobody's forcing them into this. The NFL knows it's in a position of power exactly for the reason they briefly touch on at the end of the article - they get to be on the field during football games in front of thousands of fans, and on television. The players get paid millions because each one of them makes the owners tenfold what they're paying the player. It's economics - the cheerleaders don't earn the NFL that much, plus they're expendable in that there's a never-ending line of women who would love to be NFL cheerleaders. If they want to be treated right, there has to be some kind of economic incentive to the NFL because the NFL is probably one of the *most* capitalistic organizations out there. "

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390979770.0,"&gt; Why don't we hold the people involved personally liable for their actions? That would certainly provide the incentives to minimize casualties.

Then everyone who ever fights a war would be charged with mass murder or something. It's unrealistic.

&gt;I usually have the same view with torture and stuff. Yeah, if you're Jack Bauer and have less than 24 hours to find a nuclear bomb before it detonates, the use of torture might be justified in finding that information fast. But lets say someone innocent is tortured or that torture is a punishment that does not match this person's crimes. What then? Well, just like if any other citizen tortured another, the torturer and all who approved it should be held personally liable. By a proportionality principle, the innocent victim can even have them tortured. That'd certainly make people think twice about it's use while still allowing room for legitimate use. They're just taking on a huge personal risk if they do so, which is the correct outcome IMO.

I'd say that you'd need to look at the intentions involved.

&gt;Just so happens that's what happens in a free market as well where everyone is held liable for their actions and a certain group isn't given infinite ""get out of jail free"" cards.

What makes you think this wouldn't happen in a free market?

&gt;I believe in principles and justice. This is not a sign of simplicity, and your rejection of them is not a sign of intellectual depth.

Fair enough, but I do think that principles and justice sometimes seem quaint and naive in dealing with the nuances of life.

&gt;Starting two new wars in Libya and Uganda, extending the Patriot Act, continuing drone strikes, not closing Guantanamo, and not keeping to the original ""end war"" dates he campaigned on are all certainty strange ways to show his dedication to get out of these wars.

To be honest, there was international pressure to get involved in those places. Beyond that, maybe he just has more on his plate than w're giving him credit for?

&gt; Again, giving benefit of the doubt to people you give the right to murder, enslave, and rob at will is a strange mix.

I knwo this sounds hollow to you, but I really believe things are a bit more complex than that, and I kinda believe that your framing of the issue is basically an oversimplified strawman. Not saying you don't offer legitimate points, it's easy to be against those things, and I think these things should at the very least be questioned, but I really do think that the decisions you have to make as president are complicated."

Just to be up-front about personal biases: I'm a long-time player, and I'm a long-time player moderator; I've seen the game develop over the years, and as a mod I've seen some aspects of the company that the average player hasn't. However, I don't always agree with Jagex, and I'm not afraid to express that. It's not like I got a mod position by fanatically agreeing with everything they say and do. But, I do enjoy the game, and I do think they've made more good calls than bad ones; otherwise I wouldn't still be playing.

**I can't be mad about folks getting banned for breaking the rules.** I can't; I just can't. The rules are there, they aren't difficult to understand, and you agreed to follow them when you made an account - if you don't intend to do so, then you're being disingenuous from the start, and I don't really want to play games with disingenuous people. Typically people don't get immediately banned for something as small as autotyping anyway; you get warned *at least* once first (though how universal that is has varied by year). You may have lost a lot of hard work and a monetary investment, but **that doesn't excuse you breaking the rules you agreed to abide by** and I just can't get mad about that.

**The fact that lots of people were breaking the rules in that manner also doesn't excuse any one person from doing so.** For a real-life example, let's take speeding while driving. I speed sometimes, literally everyone I know speeds sometimes; it's a common thing. However, if I get pulled over and ticketed, I don't get mad at the cop over it, or at the system which put those laws in place. I was consciously breaking the law, and I knew what consequences I was risking for doing so - I decided it was worth it to risk that, expecting that I probably wouldn't get caught that time, but knowing that I *might*, and then I did. Just because everyone does it all the time doesn't make it any less illegal and doesn't excuse anyone from the consequences for breaking that law.

The same reasoning applies to folks who were botting or autotyping or scamming or whatever and got warned, muted, or banned for it. You said you read the rules, you agreed to follow those rules, and then you broke those rules. If you weren't willing to suffer the consequences of being temp or perm muted or banned, then you shouldn't have chosen to break those rules.

And at worst, you can always make a new account; IP bans are a pretty rare thing, as far as I'm aware. Yes, you lost the work you put into the banned account, but since **getting banned was your fault and something you knew you were risking anyway**, it's pretty cool that you can still start over if you want to.

So the whole idea that Jagex is dumb for enforcing their own rules is pretty idiotic, in my opinion.

As for not listening to their playerbase... yeah, they've been pretty bad about that at times. However, it sounds like you left around 2008 - things have definitely changed since then. They're ***much*** more receptive to player feedback nowadays; they've been implementing oft-requested minor and major changes (including bringing back free trade and the old Wilderness, which happened quite some time ago actually); they even have an in-game polling system to influence future updates. They've done really minor stuff via their website-based polls before, but now it's in-game and on a regular basis, which is neat.

So yeah, they've made dumb moves in the past when it comes to listening to their players, but they've definitely improved on that front, enough that I wouldn't say it's a major problem anymore.

Also, some of those dumb moves weren't terrible ideas, considering the issues they were facing - they were trying to combat the massive influx of bots, which were seriously ruining the economy and messing with the average player experience. They tried the easy stuff, and some not-so-easy stuff, and when they ran out of things to do that didn't involve drastic changes but still hadn't solved the problem... they made drastic changes. Players didn't like those changes, and they didn't entirely work either, so later they undid many of those changes. Now, bots aren't a huge issue anymore, which is really, *really* nice (though it has caused some economic issues, since we relied on bots for basic resources for so long).

I'm really not sure how you can be mad at a company trying to protect the kids playing the game from having the stuff they worked hard to earn taken away from them, considering you were really mad about that a few paragraphs before when talking about players getting banned. I agree that they probably went overboard with getting rid of free trade (it's back now, btw, has been for several years), but that really had more to do with bots than scamming. While I agree that there are some lessons which need to be learned, and sometimes the best way to learn those lessons is the hard way, I don't think anyone needs a game for that - I got ""scammed"" plenty of times in real life before I ever played Runescape. And I don't really want to be learning hard life lessons in a game that I play to relax and de-stress, anyway. So no, **I can't be mad about a company trying to protect their users who are young enough to be easily tricked or manipulated.**

Are the game and the company without any flaws? Hell no. I hate the microtransactions which have worked their way into the game - I tolerate them because I understand the reasoning behind them, and because Jagex has made quite a bit of effort to keep the game from being pay-to-win (aside from the subscription aspect, but that's not really what I mean when I say pay-to-win). I dislike that I can't access all the game content without finding a group of other players to play with, because that just doesn't appeal to me. I often dislike the grindy nature of the game, that requires hours on hours of simple repetitive tasks in order to progress... but I do like that I can log in for an hour or two and make a bit of progress towards a major long-term goal, and making and then reaching those goals is definitely one of the biggest reasons I've kept playing this game from middle school through and past college.

From talking with people online and in real life about the game, I disagree with you regarding public opinion of the game and how/why that is the way it is. Most folks my age seem to remember Runescape not for the bans, or the lack of notice given to player feedback, but instead because of the grind and shitty tutorial - they never really got into the game, because they couldn't get past the beginning. One of my roommates always talks about how all she remembers is taking ten minutes to successfully cook her first shrimp for the tutorial; another friend remembered quitting after being scammed multiple times; yet another played for a while but just got bored of the grind. I think you're taking your personal experience with the game and projecting it onto others, or assuming that everyone dislikes it for the same reasons you do, when that isn't the case. Runescape falls into the category of ""things that are dangerously nerdy,"" along with WoW, LoL, D&amp;D, and so on. Runescape is a bit odd in that even within communities like reddit and /r/gaming, it still gets that same kind of response of ""Wow, you play/like that? You're weird,"" but I don't think that happens for the reasons you've described. (Folks also associate Runescape with childhood, because that's when *they* played it, which is part of why there's a stigma around playing it when you're older than, say, 15.)

While I don't disagree that Runescape will never be what it once was, I don't think that's a bad thing - nothing stays the same, and nothing should. Change is not always *good*, but it is *necessary*. It's really cool for me to see how the game has changed over the years (there's a timelapse gif of Varrock on the world map over on the front page of /r/runescape right now which is pretty cool to see), and I don't think I'd have it any other way.

However, there is enough demand for the ""good ol' days"" that they've set up servers for the game as it was in 2007, if you're interested; before the Grand Exchange, before the Squeal of Fortune, before Evolution of Combat. It's not something *I'm* at all interested in, and I'm not convinced it will last; I think it's just the next iteration of RSC, which has almost entirely died out because people largely play for nostalgia - but it may be something that interests you, as well as others who have left the game but still remember parts of it fondly. Just figured I'd mention it, since you seem to be pretty out of touch regarding events over the past few years."

Just last year this guy ditched us every time we invited him to something (and it's not like we invite him to something everyday) making excuses for not hanging out with us. Sure you can hang out with your girl it's totally cool but to hangout with her 24/7 and ditch us without giving good reason for it is a real piss off. 

We didn't really do anything to fix the problem though. We'd get pissed at him for ditching us and openly say that he was whipped but it didn't matter what we said he ""loved"" her too much. Eventually he broke up with her because of her family not approving when they found out and because he finally realized how controlling she was.

Anyways the messed up part is they're back together again even after all the shit we talked about her and all the shit he talked about her after the break up. But it seems like she herself has realized she shouldn't control someone like that and has given him more freedom this time around. Hopefully that doesn't change and if it does hopefully my friend has some balls this time around and ends it. We're also a group of early 20 somethings so a very similar situation.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1390980428.0,"If you're suggesting that someone should deliver prepared, healthy meals to poor families -- or make it so they have access to them -- that would be highly advantageous. But if the choice is between food stamps they can't use anywhere in a ten mile radius of their home and McDonalds, and they're starving right now, the short-term solution is to let hungry people eat McDonalds.

Like I said, a lot of poor people don't chose bad, cheap, and fast food because they want to. They chose it because they don't have any other choice. So yeah, if it's the 28th and your stamps have run out and someone sets a bushel of kale and a box of rice at a grocery store ten miles away or a couple buckets of KFC on the corner, what are you going to chose? The most bang for your buck. The thing you can get without wasting time you need to clean, take care of the kids, and work two jobs. KFC, every time.

Until the structural barriers are demolished that prevent those in poverty from taking time to cook, shop, and make choices that aren't about literal starvation, talking about obesity in the context of people who are hungry is silly.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390980430.0,"&gt; Essentially then, your position is that the governments of the world have a justified right to the territories they own, BUT they do not have a justified right to claim sovereignty over the entirety of existence? Am I correct?

Yes, and as far as I know, if you do seasteading in international waters, yeah, governments don't own that. 

&gt;Meaning, ancap space pilgrims could move to Mars and, in your opinion, be justified in defending their collective territories from aggressive states here on Earth?

We don't own mars, do we? Be my guest.

&gt;As an ancap, I doubt states and their constituencies would respect ancap-land sovereignty, because of their nature as states.

This is possible, but at the same time, we'd end up having to, especially if you have claims on toher planets. Otherwise we'd end up doing the same thing that happened to the Brits trying to keep control over the colonies. When you fight a war in a far away place, it's impractical to keep it up unless you have good supply lines. And we wouldn't going to mars. It would take years just to reinforce ourselves. Seasteading could become more problematic though.

&gt;I think you should reflect more deeply on why states (as corporate entities - republics) are justified sovereigns, how they gain and lose this justification, and to what extent they are products of their time. States are, pragmatically speaking, land-renting corporations with strange shareholding systems that acquistioned their properties through conquest, genocide, theft, and fraud. When there is additional space for humans to colonize, what sorts of governing entities may arise?

I'm familiar with our past. But hey, it's our past, let's not dwell on it. 

I actually think anarcho capitalism would be much more viable in the future when ever expanding land and colonies, quite frankly. That's actually my big problem with libertarianism and free market economics...the fact that everything is already owned. If we lived in say, minecraft, where i would just need to go out a bit more and establish a new farm or mine or something, and we had unlimited resources and blah blah blah, yeah, such ideals of rugged individualism and making your own way without the intervention of others and being left alone make sense. But the problem is, all land is claimed, and beyond that, all land is owned. That being said, the idea of going out and being a rugged individual is impossible, because i can't just go out and claim a piece of land...that's theft. Opportunities are limited, and basically I see myself as having to play someone else's game. In order to survive, I have to work in their business, on their terms, or basically screw off and die. And that's pretty much why I see capitalism as exploitative, and all the ""advice"" people give from such a perspective as unrealistic, because it's much easier said than done. But in an ever expanding world, in a world where i can just go out a bit further, to a new planet to terraform, or say another 1000 blocks out in minecraft, i can be king of my own castle, live by my own terms, etc. It's just unrealistic to expect such things in our current realities."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390980689.0,"&gt; I don't disagree with you. But I'm hard-pressed to see why I, or anyone else, should be able to force religious individuals from living in a community of like-minded people and rituals. The Federal Government was, and in many ways, still is a mild theocracy by supporting laws that arguably have a religious basis (gay marriage, pot) -- except you have no recourse away from this without ""changing the law,"" a long and arduous process during which many people who should rightly enjoy the benefits you desire will simply die before such laws come to pass.

Yes, and as an atheist, I'm rigorously against that. The problem is, atheists like myself would likely face discrimination and denial of rights simply for being...well...me. You know like 6 states ban atheists from holding public office right? They're not enforced because of the federal constitution taking precedence, but yeah...they're still on the books. 

&gt;With theocratic municipalities, it'd be much easier to move -- and as long as we're speculating here, I think truth is more powerful than a lie

I disagree, if this were true, religion would've died long ago. The only thing that's making it more questioned now is because it's being more challenged because people no longer live in their little bubbles because of the internet....establish these communities and they would quickly root out ""godless evil"" or whatever, censor stuff, etc. 

&gt;With theocratic municipalities, it'd be much easier to move -- and as long as we're speculating here, I think truth is more powerful than a lie. Religion, at least extremist religion, doesn't stand much of a chance against the internet. Theocracies would have to cut off or control access to the internet, which is going to be increasingly difficult as time goes on (and it would be economically counter-productive).

No, since you eliminated the freedom of speech and religion and press by getting rid of the federal government, you just ENABLED them to do it. "

In CO we were caregivers for multiple patients 20+ that we could grow 6 plants each for.  This was before dispensary legislation was passed.  We were able to bring those patients under our license when we started, so we had some initial inventory.  Minimal, but enough to get rolling.  Today we have about 300 that are assigned to our center.

When legislation gets passed, it will be a while before it is implemented.  During that time somebody will offer legal seminars for money.  Pay it and learn.  Either that or you can read the law if you speak legaleeze.  Once things kick off, you have to start growing then, and wait until you crop in a minimum of 4 months before you will have inventory to sell.  

It really depends on what is contained in the law as to what you will be able to do.   I would advise waiting until you see what that is.  The law will likely establish a regulatory department at the state level.  Somebody wants those license fees!  Getting a head start might kill your whole deal and land you in jail.

Lawyers and legal advisers are much less expensive before you get into trouble.  Good Luck!"

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1390981226.0,"This post resonated with me. I avoid violence as well, and hate when I'm forced into it outside the ring.

I used to box in college. Never made it to nor won nationals like many teammates did. I lacked their ferocity and mainly made myself useful training club members who wanted to join the team.

I knocked someone out once, even though collegiate/amateur boxing usually uses heavy 16 oz gloves and headgear. From then on, I always had this instinctive fear of killing my opponent that I never completely overrode. It causes you to often pull your punches a bit even when you consciously want to follow through.

A lot of people romanticize fights when many don't understand that a single well-executed cross with your body weight behind it can potentially kill a guy. A lot of people I know were actually surprised when they heard on the news some mid aged guy from SF was killed by a sucker punch while visiting Oakland.

A lot of girls especially have a warped view of violence, and the blame goes to much of society for feeding pretty little lies.

**Lie #1: Girls cannot hurt guys.**

A lot of girls I knew in college upon hearing I was on the team asked me to hit them. Only the first time did I do so seriously. Against a couple girls, girlA and girlB. First it was a quick light jab to girlA's held out hand. Her hand flew back from the momentum and knocked her glasses off her hand. We didn't see that coming and shit ourselves laughing. GirlB didn't believe it or thought it was a fluke that girlA wasn't prepared. She wanted to test her luck as well. She put two hands up this time, one supporting the other. I swear with all my integrity that the EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED. She also underestimated the speed of a real jab and her own glasses got knocked off when her supporting hand flew back and hit her. We were all gutted; it was one of my movie moments.

Yes I was careless. I don't know how we made it through college with such little sense.

For a long period of time afterwards, girlB kept punching me whenever she felt like it. I thought it was playful, so I ignored it, but she started aiming for my face. I finally had enough when she landed a solid sucker punch on my face as I was turning around to face her. Her thumbnail left a scratch mark that stung for a few days. She explained that it was my fault for telling her that I dodge/slip punches without looking at the fist. What the fuck. She either forgot or didn't bother to understand that I still faced the opponent and looked at their overall body and stance. A sucker punch from out of nowhere is totally different. I'm not Spider-Man.

I realized later that I had been training her to become more violent towards me by ignoring her escalating force. She must have started to actually believe that she literally could not hurt me. I also thought I could just ignore it safely and felt like we were cool. I made her knock her glasses off after all and had some guilt. 

I wonder how many other guys like me brainlessly taught girls to become more and more violent towards them.

**Lie #2: Girls handle damage as well as guys.**

After college, I joined an MMA gym to fill in the gap. There were no women members so when an attractive blonde joined, a lot of guys were ecstatic. Not just because she was hot, but because she was novel.

She seemed cool as Hell too. We'll call her Sonya Blade.

She had several years of martial arts under her belt from multiple gyms, so presumably she was good. *Way* better than me, at least, for sure. After all, I just started two months ago, and kicking/grappling were new to me. Her experience and versatility should have made her stronger.

Or so I believed.

I noticed quickly she never grappled. Well, of course. Less upper body strength and weight, and she prob didn't want to roll around on the ground with some sweaty fat men who hadn't bothered to lose it before starting MMA. I couldn't blame her since I certainly wasn't enjoying the manboob juice being shoved in my face.

But I also noticed that no one really sparred her seriously. *Not a problem... Sonya probably wasn't serious either.* see, I know that girls, while they lacked upper body strength/weight, had plenty of lower body strength. They also have better balance due to lower center of mass. Right? That's what I've always been taught from k-12 gym class and through media.

Still bugged me that everyone was walking on eggshells around her, while we were going at well over 50% against each other, because of male ego and escalation so common in sparring. Seemed like she was being left out at the time.

When it was my time to partner with her, she said she'd show me some moves. I was enthusiastic until she revealed that it would be a scissor kick. A fucking scissor kick. Can someone teach me Guile's blade kick too? I thought the scissor kick was reserved for movies and video games. Apparently, it's real. But yeah... Open hand, open mind.

Sonya went airborne and caught me between her legs. I didn't budge while she fell unto the mat.  Not that I was expecting an MK fatality, but the ineffectiveness and absurdity of that move was too much for me to react in time to. I didn't even have the time to just fall down and go along with it while not making it look faked.

*""I messed up. Let me try again,""* she innocently stammered. This time I was prepared and just let myself bend and fall over. She genuinely looked happy and satisfied while I stewed in my dishonesty. I think I might have even called it ""impressive"" or ""cool"".

While sparring her ""seriously"", I fought awkwardly, because this wasn't boxing, and I still wasn't used to holding back on faster kicks as I was punches. While they were not as damaging as the guys' kicks, her kicks were solid enough, and starting to annoy. The instructor told me to kick back as I was giving too much space to her. I started kicking back and sprained or maybe just bruised her leg accidentally.

Stuff like this happens often. A hit at the right/wrong angle can easily cause a sprain. Shit happens... and I shat bricks. The rest of the class never let me forget that I hurt an attractive girl. The instructor/gym owner even later took me aside quietly and asked me why I wasn't going at 20% with her. I told him I was. He told me to bring it down to 10% next time, if there was going to be a next time. 

To her credit, she took the situation like a champ despite limping the rest of the day and sticking to light stuff for the week. She said I got a lucky shot in and I laughed it off with her. It would have been a minor thing if Sonya was a guy, but everyone was even more cautious with her then. No one wanted to hurt her or her feelings. She was cute, nice, and no one wanted to discourage her.

I wondered what kind of crap her past McDojos taught her, and how she can have over 5 years exp of martial arts without questioning the efficacy of some of her moves in a usually serious MMA gym, like that scissor kick. She claimed to have started martial arts for self-defense, not just pride... And yet everyone was comfortable feeding her pretty little lies, including myself.

I wondered how many other girls have warped views about violence because of the kiddy gloves men treat them with, just because most of us (men and women) can't stomach seeing girls get hurt.

I wonder how many in general have their views distorted by society's intangible equivalent of those kiddy gloves... this dishonest, elaborate hoax.

The switch can be a basic netgear smartswitch with poe if needed, and if 48 ports is a requirement, get the 48 port poe version.  

Now that you have that setup, you need to look at your router and internet connection.  It's no use having QoS only to have your router or provider ignore the flags.  So either two connections are needed or you need 1 line specifically provisioned for voice.  Two is simpler.

Your voip provider can work with you on the second line.  But now you need to decide if you want to lease or own the phones, and have an on prem or hosted voip.  Just get a quote on both ways and let the execs decide.  

If you feel okay with your internet link, like you've got an ethernet handoff or something, this should be easy to get an IP, and have QoS setup with the provider.  

If you don't, then I'd say go with canadian equivalent of a verizon, comcast, and get the whole voice+internet business package.  You'll save yourself a lot of time and headache, and only need to worry about getting voice traffic to their router with a qos flag on it.  "

If you want to set boundaries, you need to call people out whenever they do something that upsets you - and you need to do it right away.

Just say ""hey!"" Then give yourself a moment to think about how to phrase your objection. If you look and sound upset when you call out your dissatisfaction, most people will remain still and quiet long enough to hear you out. Then, be upfront and tell them why you're not okay with what just happened.

The best way to begin this process is to start by coming up with a list of things that have upset you in the past - times when you felt disrespected but didn't say anything. Take some time to learn a thing or two about yourself, and then start taking responsibility for looking out for yourself."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390981961.0,"Ok, I'm starting this about 1:30 in...but...yeah, oversimplification. I'm familiar with the arguments already. 

1) This argument says that employers compete. Only true to a degree. I don't believe that employers, given their superior bargaining position, lower number, and higher education levels, necessarily compete all that much. If they do, they might offer a dime or a quarter more than the other guys, but not much. They don't want to get involved in price wars because this leads to a race to the bottom. While workers are often pressured into cut throat tactics against one another, undercutting the price of labor and any attempts to unionize and cooperate, which makes THEM engaged in a race to the bottom because ultimately, they are also DESPERATE and have fewer options. That being said, this argument is overly simplistic and fails to take into consideration the differences between the two sides. Businesses are generally more organized, educated, and in a generally more powerful position than workers are.

2) I find the idea of such interactions being voluntary to be misleading at best and blatantly dishonest at worst. If I'm being robbed at gun point, I can CHOOSE to say no...if I want a bullet in the head. Likewise, when you're desperate and under duress because you're in a bad situation, you'll agree to anything. It doesn't matter whether it's voluntary or not. It's still coercive and exploitative. And no, exploitation DOES NOT go away...where's the PROFIT in that? If people become rich enough to say no, screw yourself to bad deals....then guess what? The rich ahve to up their game...which means less profit for them. So I don't buy into the tide that raises all boats argument, especially in the face of increasing economic inequality over the last 40 years or so.


3) The video goes into the anti state blah blah blah private interests rhetoric, which is a problem, but it ignores the fact that it CAN work for the people too. Yeah, I don't buy it. Quite frankly, I think it's just what they want. They get corporations to say that because government sometimes works for private interests, it should be gotten rid of, and somehow this will help everyone, when it just leads to exploitation. Pure propaganda. While there;s a half truth involved here, the solution isn't to get rid of government, it's to make sure the government actually helps the right people. Especially since eliminating government would just deepen human suffering on every level.

Look, the thing is, we dont need government out of business, we need business out of government. We need regulation for the public good, and social safety nets. Just because crony capitalism exists, doesn't mean that the state is automatically bad, blah blah blah.

Im serious, that video just went full fledged propaganda at the end. It didn't even address the fact that government does good things too. It just went in a one sided anti government tirade about crony capitalism while overlooking all the good government has done, like:

1) environmental regulations

2) minimum wage, 40 hour work weeks, OSHA, etc.

3) Social security, medicare, medicaid, unemployment comp, disability, etc.

Seriously. Once again, I don't deny that problems with government exist. I don't deny that it sometimes acts to bolster private interests, but once again, reality isn't that black and white, and the government completely screwing off on the matter of economics has its own problems.

sorator,runescape,1390982018.0,"Remember to set your melee combat to ""balanced"" before punching a chicken! Otherwise you'll miss a skill or two.

I'd change the order you have things listed based on where they are located - it's really inefficient to run from the summoning obelisk over to the bank to pickpocket a merchant and then all the way back to the hebrlore store to grab the free supplies there. Unless there's a pompous merchant between the summoning shop and the herblore shop? Furthermore, you should kill the chickens before going to the herblore shop instead of after, again to avoid needless backtracking.

Also remember to fill your inventory with the free and cheap stuff available around Taverly, like the vials of water &amp; eyes of newt from Jatix, the broad-tipped arrowheads from the slayer master, the feathers &amp; bowstrings from the fletching shop, and the vials of water/newt eyes/white berries/limpwurt roots/unicorn horn dust from the herblore store. I can usually get everything except half the bowstrings in one run through the area, though with the other stuff you carry to do JoT you may not be able to. Still free money, so fill any empty inventory spaces before leaving!

Also, for those who don't wanna mess with the clockwork toy (I wouldn't, heh), you can get a free bird snare from the hunter trainer just across from the herblore shop and set it up before cutting logs, and you'll probably have caught a bird by the time you've cooked something and fletched something.

Other easy options:

* Explorer's ring to superheat some ore from your bank to cover magic + smithing

* Any of the easy agility shortcuts around the world, such as the tunnel northeast of the Grand Exchange

* Pickpocket &amp; kill a guard, like the ones by the Varrock lodestone and in the Varrock palace near Xuan.

You can also activate your aura and then go do some other dailies that you maybe should be doing anyway, like red sandstone &gt; flasks (mining &amp; crafting), using the essence from a wicked hood at your highest available altar (runecrafting), farming runs, daily challenges, etc.

Regarding farming runs: to avoid doing herb runs without having Greenfingers active, I like to do the bush at the ardy monastary via the ardy cape, home tele to Al-Kharid to pick cactus spines, Tokkul-Zo teleport 3 to fairy ring to CKS and pick and plant mushrooms, and sometimes cabbage port to grab marigolds/limpwurts. That's my ""minor"" farm run, as opposed to ""major"" herb runs and tree runs which actually require significant prep."

EDIT: Realized I didn't adequately address your question. The best thing you can do to recover from an injury is to give yourself time to recover. You can still exercise, but please consider dialing things down a bit. I've got chronic ankle and knee problems, so while I don't know your exact situation - here's what worked for me.

I had to dial back the amount of exercising I do by a lot, and give myself a day or two to recover. For example, 
while I'm in recovery, I generally swim. You can use a pull-buoy so you don't have to kick. Some gyms will have hand bicycles for people dealing with injuries. They aren't particularly dignified, but if you turn the resistance up, you can get some exercise.  

When my knee is less aggravated, I use an indoor rower/erg and really get a good workout. It's not really a bodyweight exercise though.

And... karate and kickboxing really tear up your knees. Consider giving yourself either a day off to recover by doing something light the day afterwards. If you incapacitate yourself, you won't reach your fitness goals. 

I also tend to eat a bit less when I'm injured, and I tend to feel less hungry from exercising less. 

Good luck! "

Alaira314,WTF,1390982744.0,"I've experienced this rage before.  There's a road near where I live that's got a 30 mph limit, but everybody drives 45~ on it, sometimes even inching up towards 50 mph.  The speed limit is that low for a reason, but people get so angry(illegal, aggressive passing and road rage) if you dare to drive anything under 40 that it's actually safer to just go with the flow of traffic rather than try to hold the moral high ground.  The one time I won't cave is when the weather's bad.

We had a decent storm last week, and the next day I was driving home along that road(which hadn't really been plowed well at that point, so it was still kind of icy) at about the speed limit(give or take 2-3 mph), when a SUV roared up behind me, passed on the right(one of those weird 1.5 lane roads), nearly hit a parked car, and sped off down the road.

MusingMagus,AskMen,1390982766.0,"&gt;I'm talking about the same men saying they can't help but like certain traits because allegedly they're hard-wired to like those traits. and then those same men go on to say they also like other traits that would evolutionarily indicate an infertile mate. i'm not sure how they reconcile these two things with each other,

The answer is simple and has already been given in this thread, but you, for some reason, keep posting trying to dispute the obvious (and correct) answer.  

If a person is hardwired to like certain things, they don't have to like *only* those things.  Someone can be hardwired to like certain traits that indicate success nurturing children, and also like *other* traits, even those that indicate possible inferiority in the same category, out of *personal preference*.

Here's another example:  I like pain.  I'm hardwired to avoid pain.  If I accidentally touch the inside of my oven while pulling out a tray of cookies, my hand jerks away from the source of pain.  This is hardwiring.  However, I can also take pleasure from dragging a sharp blade across my skin.  This is personal preference.  The two are at odds, but that fact is easily reconciled when you take personal preference into account.

On an unrelated note, you're a bit of an asshole.  I looked through your post history, and most of it amounts to ""you're wrong"", ""well actually..."" ""that's dumb"", etc.

You have your answer.  You'll probably continue to bitch and whine anyway, if your post history is any indication.

Piss off, mate."

It is disrespectful to me, to them and to my SO.  I stayed friends with a guy in college who wanted more from me, and i regret the way i treated him. Not because i didn't sleep with him, but because i would do stupid shit in the name of friendship like call him all the time, monopolize his thursday and friday nights, tag along on dates, and the like.  I needed to let him go find the person who did want to sleep with him and i didn't really let him do that by emotionally monopolizing his time. And the worst is that it hurt my relationship with my then SO because i relied so heavily on the friend for emotional support that there was no headspace for my SO.

I think it is cruel when people are like, ""but s/he's my best friend"" when it is obvious that maintaining a certain level of closeness is detrimental to both parties- either in not giving one's relationship the emotional space to grow, or in not having the space to pursue another relationship where all the pieces are there."

Mr_Clovis,leagueoflegends,1390983320.0,"Sad thing is that his ult is the hardest hitting ability (on a single target) in the game, by far. At its theoretical maximum it deals 1980 base damage + 825% of bonus AD + 330% bonus AP. That's more than 4000 damage in an endgame build. On a 50 second cooldown and with 1400 range. By the logistics alone, it's downright bonkers.

But people still think it doesn't deal damage because it's so hard to hit. Increasing its damage won't help with that as it's already so high. So Riot needs to make it more reliable somehow without fundamentally changing the way it works (and then probably nerf the damage when people realize how absurd it is)."

I have my flaws but his past experience has taught him that there aren't a lot of me out there.   

He had several girlfriends and dated a lot of girls who were pushing hard for him to be a family man which would involve radically changing his lifestyle, and if he wanted to do that, he already would have.

However, your dollar amount resets on January 1st and you must re-qualify each year in order to keep VIB Rouge. So the person who reached rouge in Nov, 2013 must spend $1,000 throughout the 2014 calendar year in order to retain their status for the following year. If they don't reach the $1,000 limit they will not have rouge status for 2015. I believe whatever amount you did spend would establish your 2015 status, such as spending $350 and you would have VIB status.

Stale coffee in the back of my throat. Watching out for deer in the woods. Joints rubbing together as I firmly gripped the steering wheel.

UrbanRenegade19,AskMen,1390984266.0,"Never finding someone who will love me. After getting shot down time and time again it gets really hard to stay hopeful about things. I know it's been said before, and that douchebags say it all the time, but I really am a nice guy. I know no one owes it to me to show me affection or date me. I also know that it's no one's fault if they just aren't attracted to me. Still to get turned down time and time again, it really hurts. Especially when I get told over and over again that I'm a really great guy and I'll make some girl incredibly happy one day.

It's hard not to be cynical about things, and it's hard to be hopeful. It's been nearly 5 years since I've been on a date and even longer since I've received any sort of affection. I keep thinking maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe I'm just not being the kind of person that I'm supposed to be. Maybe I'm just broken and nobody has had the heart to tell me.

 I like reading books, writing poetry, and cooking. And I've heard it a thousand times from girls before that they would love to find a guy with interests like mine. But in the end all I get is an easy let down, a somber hug, and another night alone.

What makes it worse is that I've always wanted to have a family. To have a wife that loved me and wanted to be with me. To have kids that I can show the world to and see the sparkle in their eyes.

I haven't given up yet, and I still keep telling myself ""maybe next time"". It still hurts though. And it's getting harder and harder to keep going with the dream of finding love.

HumanSockPuppet,asktrp,1390984360.0,"&gt; Ok, so how would you suggest I bring up the issue of payment?

Don't bring it up at all.

**Here's what you do:** bring enough money with you to pay for your ticket and hers, but when it comes time to pay, only pay for your own. Once you've paid, just act natural. Put on your climbing shoes and walk inside - make like you're gonna meet up with her inside when she's done paying.

She'll either take this as a cue to pay for herself (in which case mission accomplished), or she'll be forced to speak up and ask for your help.

Whatever happens, don't dispel the awkwardness by dealing with it automatically. **Let her feel awkward.**

Odds are, one of three scenarios will go down:

**Bad girl scenario:** She'll give you a classic bullshit excuse like ""I forgot my wallet"". Or, if she's *really* self-entitled, she might even have the balls to say ""Aren't you going to pay for me?"" like it's her royal fucking birthright.

If it goes down like this, just laugh and say ""too bad"". Then leave her ass in the lobby, enjoy your evening of climbing, and know that you've dodged a bullet.

Oh, and be sure to post the story and her angry texts over at TRP.

**Decent girl scenario:** She'll ask you to pay for her ticket, but she'll seem positively apologetic about it. She might even be too embarrassed to say anything; she'll just stand there frozen in awkward shame. Let her stew for a few silent seconds, then come over, pay for her ticket, and head inside. For the rest of the date, she's just lost face and she needs to win your affection back. Don't talk about your paying for her - just come off like you're disappointed in her (which you should be).

This kind of reaction is the hallmark of a girl with low self-esteem.

**Best case scenario:** She just pays for her own ticket like a well-adjusted adult. Then, the two of you head in, and you put your hands all over her, kinoing like a boss as you teach her how to climb."

Trying to escalate to meeting in-person is his way of insuring against that, and I think it's a reasonable way to weed out people who aren't that interested.

The problem with bringing in free agent corners is basically the same problem as bringing back Brown or Rogers - it costs a lot of money that we don't have to spare.  I think if we wanted to spend $5 million on a CB, we'd probably spend it on Brown.

You go on to demean Cobain for what you perceive as prejudice, because he demeaned those he perceived as prejudiced. You ""admire him less"" rather than fucking hating him, but I imagine you have less intense emotions and convictions than that man in general due to the environment you exist in.

To add to this, the worst thing we can do for those confident in their hateful beliefs is cater to them. The best way to get an unethical person to change their ways is to make their lifestyle inhospitable. There needs to be a golden glow of cooperating with society to draw them in, but the idea that being friendly to them and treating them normally will change them is a reason some people stay in abusive relationships. If they have one other person who affirms  or ignores the way they live their life left, and they are satisfied with that human relationship, they will continue being prejudiced. It's better if cds berate them for their beliefs, even if only a little bit.

I think the pinterest look will have a bit more red/pink shadow above the crease and maybe a stronger black liner smudged on the upper lashline.

The lips would be an ombre effect using a darker liner/lipstick in the corners and blending into a brighter red in the middle, plus a gloss. [Here's the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/1kfa14/fotd_the_traditional_black_smokey_eye_overwhelms/) where /u/TheKittenButcher did a similar lip but without a gloss.

nicih,sex,1390985544.0,"20 is quite young and I assume this might be your both first domestic partnership, and you will grow into what is going to be a marvellous and amazing relationship if you are ready to work towards it together :) 

A vibrator does much more than just a finger, though I prefer two vibrators. One in (at the G-spot) and one on the klit. Also there is multiple vibrators that can reach both places. Se absolutely needs to study herself. Before my SO I thought I couldn't have orgasms with a partner, but boy was I wrong. Now I usually have about 5 orgasms per lovemaking. You don't need to be perfect together from the start, everything is work and learning after you find each other, and that goes to every human relationship. 

Now, I could give you a few good examples on vibrator types. I assume you're from the US, I'm from Europe, but the toys are similar worldwide. Found these on Amazon, and these are also here where I live. 

One great is a [Jack Rabbit with floating beads](http://www.amazon.com/California-Exotics-Waterproof-Rabbit-Floating/dp/B001GCVKU0/ref=sr_1_6?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390985189&amp;sr=1-6) is great for reaching both places! 

And another great one is just a plain [Lady Finger](http://www.amazon.com/Sheer-Lady-Finger-Asst-Colors/dp/B0038HXHTS/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390985280&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=lady+finger) for the klitoris. 

Now all vibrators don't do the same, and also won't work on every girl. Some might not like it, some will forget about their own fingers instantly! I suggest: try, practise and have fun! Never take any pressure about it :) 

Also it could be just so so great for her to explore porn. I bet she'll love it, her attitude is telling me she would like to study it more, but maybe she just thinks it's supposed not to be interesting for a girl. "

One addition about long-term birth-control that may or may not be relevant to OP: I've had nothing but the best experience with Gynefix. I just wanted to add this because many women are not doing well on hormonal contraception and it is important to know that there are other, non-hormonal, options out there that work with reasonable and long-term reliability. I am not sure about Gynefix' availability on the American continent, but i am sure there are other intra-uterine devices that might work as an alternative, should the need arise. Either way i wish you all the best, OP."
TooPoorForLaundry,loseit,1390985547.0,"Food wise, get rid of any crap or junk food in the house and stock up on healthy stuff. Snacking is fine if you're chewing on cherry tomatoes. I still have *huge* meals, but most of the plate is salad. 

Use MyFitnessPal or similar to track the calories. You can get a *lot* of healthy food in your body and still be under the limit.

You also need to make sure you eat healthy food you enjoy, or you wont stick to it. I experiment with fruit, and I love veggies and fish boiled in lemon. Bit weird, but it's healthy, not full of calories and it's food I genuinely look forward to eating.

As for the gym, I suck at this. I actually pay a personal trainer. I find it helps to have a 3rd party keep me motivated. I see you've mentioned you don't like training with your boyfriend – you could always see if you can find a trainer that you'd rather work out with. Mine is becoming a good friend, is very supportive and pushes me *just* enough, without making me feel bad. Had to shop around before I found her, but she's just great.

Additionally, make exercise something you enjoy. I hate walking or jogging, but heading along a bush trail to a secluded pool? Count me in. I love swimming too but hate public pools, so I spent some time at the beach. Make exercise a recreation. Ice skating, abseiling, blahblahblah. There are so many fun ways to get active."

WeaklyDominant,AskReddit,1390985603.0,"This is not my story, but it *is* one of the most sickening things I have ever read on this site, so I feel obliged to share it. All credit to /u/banzaipanda for having to live through this mess, which is affectionately known as the Swamps of Dagobah story. Here it goes:

&gt; OR Nurse here. This is kind of a long one...

&gt; I was taking call one night, and woke up at two in the morning for a ""general surgery"" call. Pretty vague, but at the time, I lived in a town that had large populations of young military guys and avid meth users, so late-night emergencies were common.

&gt; Got to the hospital, where a few more details awaited me -- ""Perirectal abscess."" For the uninitiated, this means that somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the asshole, there was a pocket of pus that needed draining. Needless to say our entire crew was less than thrilled.

&gt;I went down to the Emergency Room to transport the patient, and the only thing the ER nurse said as she handed me the chart was ""Have fun with this one."" Amongst healthcare professionals, vague statements like that are a bad sign.

&gt;My patient was a 314lb Native American woman who barely fit on the stretcher I was transporting her on. She was rolling frantically side to side and moaning in pain, pulling at her clothes and muttering Hail Mary's. I could barely get her name out of her after a few minutes of questioning, so after I confirmed her identity and what we were working on, I figured it was best just to get her to the anesthesiologist so we could knock her out and get this circus started.

&gt;She continued her theatrics the entire ten-minute ride to the O.R., nearly falling off the surgical table as we were trying to put her under anesthetic. We see patients like this a lot, though, chronic drug abusers who don't handle pain well and who have used so many drugs that even increased levels of pain medication don't touch simply because of high tolerance levels.

&gt;It should be noted, tonight's surgical team was not exactly wet behind the ears. I'd been working in healthcare for several years already, mostly psych and medical settings. I've watched an 88-year-old man tear a 3""-diameter catheter balloon out of his penis while screaming ""You'll never make me talk!"". I've been attacked by an HIV-positive neo-Nazi. I've seen some shit. The other nurse had been in the OR as a trauma specialist for over ten years; the anesthesiologist had done residency at a Level 1 trauma center, or as we call them, ""Knife and Gun Clubs"". The surgeon was ex-Army, and averaged about eight words and two facial expressions a week. None of us expected what was about to happen next.

&gt;We got the lady off to sleep, put her into the stirrups, and I began washing off the rectal area. It was red and inflamed, a little bit of pus was seeping through, but it was all pretty standard. Her chart had noted that she'd been injecting IV drugs through her perineum, so this was obviously an infection from dirty needles or bad drugs, but overall, it didn't seem to warrant her repeated cries of ""Oh Jesus, kill me now.""

&gt;The surgeon steps up with a scalpel, sinks just the tip in, and at the exact same moment, the patient had a muscle twitch in her diaphragm, and just like that, all hell broke loose.

&gt;Unbeknownst to us, the infection had actually tunneled nearly a foot into her abdomen, creating a vast cavern full of pus, rotten tissue, and fecal matter that had seeped outside of her colon. This godforsaken mixture came rocketing out of that little incision like we were recreating the funeral scene from Jane Austen's ""Mafia!"".

&gt;We all wear waterproof gowns, face masks, gloves, hats, the works -- all of which were as helpful was rainboots against a firehose. The bed was in the middle of the room, an easy seven feet from the nearest wall, but by the time we were done, I was still finding bits of rotten flesh pasted against the back wall. As the surgeon continued to advance his blade, the torrent just continued. The patient kept seizing against the ventilator (not uncommon in surgery), and with every muscle contraction, she shot more of this brackish gray-brown fluid out onto the floor until, within minutes, it was seeping into the other nurse's shoes.

&gt;I was nearly twelve feet away, jaw dropped open within my surgical mask, watching the second nurse dry-heaving and the surgeon standing on tip-toes to keep this stuff from soaking his socks any further. The smell hit them first. ""Oh god, I just threw up in my mask!"" The other nurse was out, she tore off her mask and sprinted out of the room, shoulders still heaving. Then it hit me, mouth still wide open, not able to believe the volume of fluid this woman's body contained. It was like getting a great big bite of the despair and apathy that permeated this woman's life. I couldn't fucking breath, my lungs simply refused to pull anymore of that stuff in. The anesthesiologist went down next, an ex-NCAA D1 tailback, his six-foot-two frame shaking as he threw open the door to the OR suite in an attempt to get more air in, letting me glimpse the second nurse still throwing up in the sinks outside the door. Another geyser of pus splashed across the front of the surgeon. The YouTube clip of ""David at the dentist"" keeps playing in my head -- ""Is this real life?""

&gt;In all operating rooms, everywhere in the world, regardless of socialized or privatized, secular or religious, big or small, there is one thing the same: Somewhere, there is a bottle of peppermint concentrate. Everyone in the department knows where it is, everyone knows what it is for, and everyone prays to their gods they never have to use it. In times like this, we rub it on the inside of our masks to keep the outside smells at bay long enough to finish the procedure and shower off.

&gt;I sprinted to the our central supply, ripping open the drawer where this vial of ambrosia was kept, and was greeted by -- an empty fucking box. The bottle had been emptied and not replaced. Somewhere out there was a godless bastard who had used the last of the peppermint oil, and not replaced a single fucking drop of it. To this day, if I figure out who it was, I'll kill them with my bare hands, but not before cramming their head up the colon of every last meth user I can find, just so we're even.

&gt;I darted back into the room with the next best thing I can find -- a vial of Mastisol, which is an adhesive rub we use sometimes for bandaging. It's not as good as peppermint, but considering that over one-third of the floor was now thoroughly coated in what could easily be mistaken for a combination of bovine after-birth and maple syrup, we were out of options.

&gt;I started rubbing as much of the Mastisol as I could get on the inside of my mask, just glad to be smelling anything except whatever slimy demon spawn we'd just cut out of this woman. The anesthesiologist grabbed the vial next, dowsing the front of his mask in it so he could stand next to his machines long enough to make sure this woman didn't die on the table. It wasn't until later that we realized that Mastisol can give you a mild high from huffing it like this, but in retrospect, that's probably what got us through.

&gt;By this time, the smell had permeated out of our OR suite, and down the forty-foot hallway to the front desk, where the other nurse still sat, eyes bloodshot and watery, clenching her stomach desperately. Our suite looked like the underground river of ooze from Ghostbusters II, except dirty. Oh so dirty.

&gt;I stepped back into the OR suite, not wanting to leave the surgeon by himself in case he genuinely needed help. It was like one of those overly-artistic representations of a zombie apocalypse you see on fan-forums. Here's this one guy, in blue surgical garb, standing nearly ankle deep in lumps of dead tissue, fecal matter, and several liters of syrupy infection. He was performing surgery in the swamps of Dagobah, except the swamps had just come out of this woman's ass and there was no Yoda. He and I didn't say a word for the next ten minutes as he scraped the inside of the abscess until all the dead tissue was out, the front of his gown a gruesome mixture of brown and red, his eyes squinted against the stinging vapors originating directly in front of him. I finished my required paperwork as quickly as I could, helped him stuff the recently-vacated opening full of gauze, taped this woman's buttocks closed to hold the dressing for as long as possible, woke her up, and immediately shipped off to the recovery ward.

&gt;Until then, I'd only heard of ""alcohol showers."" Turns out 70% isopropyl alcohol is about the only thing that can even touch a scent like that once its soaked into your skin. It takes four or five bottles to get really clean, but it's worth it. It's probably the only scenario I can honestly endorse drinking a little of it, too.

&gt;As we left the locker room, the surgeon and I looked at each other, and he said the only negative sentence I heard him utter in two and a half years of working together:

&gt;""That was bad.""

&gt;The next morning the entire department (a fairly large floor within the hospital) still smelled. The housekeepers told me later that it took them nearly an hour to suction up all of the fluid and debris left behind. The OR suite itself was closed off and quarantined for two more days just to let the smell finally clear out.

&gt;I laugh now when I hear new recruits to healthcare talk about the worst thing they've seen. You ain't seen shit, kid.

&gt;**tl;dr Don't shoot IV drugs into your taint.**

I was waiting outside the door she would have to come out, as she was like 30 seconds behind me tops...and I was under the huge light. I got hit in the head and was attacked by the biggest effing moth I've ever seen or felt in my life.

We really compliment each other well, with our strengths and our weaknesses. I'm very focused, very driven, very decisive, but occasionally I lose sight of the bigger picture and stress myself out. But he can make me calm down in a ten minute phone call. 

And because of that, our life plans work together so well. I want to be a career woman, and even before I met him, I knew that if I were to have kids, I wouldn't want to be the primary carer. When he heard this, he was overjoyed, because he'd love to be a stay at home dad, but felt saddened by the pressure of having to be the breadwinner. But this way, everyone is happy!

My current warm squishy is the ring he made me for Christmas. It's fairly simple - just three fine wires braided for the band, and twisted to form a rose centrepiece. I'm currently working interstate for a month, and it fits me so perfectly, it feels like I'm being cuddled by him even when he's not around :)"

Death_Urthrese,leagueoflegends,1390985937.0,"i'm a leblanc main, in fact she's the only champion i play and i have to say it took me a few hundred games to learn how to play her and even then i know i can still get better.  her win ratio is so low because she's so difficult to play and people build her wrong.  the cool part about her is that she really has no real skill cap. you can only get better with her and she has so many more options than any other champion.  

usually the reason people find her weak is 

- bad wave clear
- tough to team fight with since she lacks aoe
- very squishy, if she's cc'd she's dead
- if she's not fed she falls off (supposedly)

her wave clear can be negated by maxing W first and focusing on farming rather than going for kills.  you are only trying to rush your DFG anyway so there's no real reason to max Q unless you are already able to push the lane without it.

you might have heard one of her lines ""patience summoner"".  this is exactly why it's tough to play her.  she can burst and destroy one person (hopefully a carry) instantly then help kite and pick off the rest of the team.  a good leblanc knows when to go in, what the cool downs are on the enemy CC and has an escape plan ready.  in a team fight she can't just dive in or throw out abilities like ziggs.  you need to wait for the right time to blow up one person.  her goal in a team fight is to instantly make it a 5v4

she's squishy so you need to know when to use your W to engage or to get away and kite.  this is the reason i think she's got a low rate.  everyone wants to get kills so they blow every ability on them.  but if leblanc doesn't kill them after she uses her W she'll probably die.

if your whole team is losing sure you can fall behind with them but late game she doesn't fall off.  if you rush rabadons when they are all building MR you'll lose.  if you can counter their builds you should always be able to burst anyone from 100-0 if you catch them out."

Nogbadd,AskMen,1390985961.0,"&gt; However, there are a number of positions that are often described by people as ""feminist"" that I see as being basically incompatible with the possibility of those people having a happy relationship with me, and don't date women who hold these positions. 

Isn't the point that virtually any perspective can be adopted by a woman and subsumed under the label ""feminism"" if it suits her purposes? I understand that feminism is not a monolithic belief system, but in my experience most people who self-identify as feminists also proselytise about their particular suite of opinions, whatever they are, and those opinions can be very diverse, if not mutually exclusive (such as sex positivism versus sex negativism)

Given how much you had to write to explain the nuances and caveats of your criteria, and how objectionable *some* feminists are, isn't the reality that all feminists are in the 'barge pole' category *unless proved to the contrary*?

The 1st catch is that worshiping God is for our neighbor as much as it is for ourselves -- not that it's for God and not for us. The 2nd catch is that we allow God to decide how to address our needs -- our thirst for him, our need to be ""realigned,"" etc. So we have seek to have our *deepest* needs met by God in worship rather than our shallowest needs.

It has long seemed to me that those two ""catches"" address the dilemma better than saying it's ""all for God."" I get the sense that there are *aspects* to that statement which are accurate, but that it can be as misleading as it is helpful."

HelianthusPy,GirlGamers,1390986553.0,"I'm also no expert, but I am a girl who goes to conventions like that(and has been since that age), so I may be able to give a little insight.

Don't go into the conversation intending to date the girl. More likely than not, she'll be more willing to look for a friend than a boyfriend. If you hit it off after talking and hanging out a couple times after the convention, consider asking her out then.

As far as starting the conversation goes, you could ask what she's interested in at the convention(assuming there's more than one thing, like anime, cosplay, and gaming). If there's something she's OBVIOUSLY interested in(as in, she's currently playing a game or just finished one or she's cosplaying a character you recognize) feel free to talk about that. It's a safe bet she's willing to converse about something you already know she likes. It may be easier to let the conversation evolve from that.

If you run out of things to talk about, try asking about her(or talk about your own) life outside of the convention. Do you have other hobbies? Does she? Why do you like them? Would you consider trying the same hobby? Is she here with her friends? Are you?

This could be a good point to find out her relationship status if that's super important to you. You could say something like, ""Is your boyfriend playing one of these games?"" If she says she isn't in a relationship(because not all relationships have boyfriends), just say something along the lines of ""Oh. Sorry, are your friends around then?"" to change the subject subtly, and maybe even meet her friends which would allow you to get to know her better. Even if she doesn't have a boyfriend, this implies that you think she is date-able without coming across as being too forward.


As far as what to do after, simply ask if she'd like to talk or hang out again. If she does, give her your contact info, whether that's your summoner name, phone number, or e-mail. Tell her it's ok if she doesn't want to give you hers right away. That way, it's a hint that you want it without directly asking and forcing her to say yes or no. If she wants to give it to you, she will do so freely.

As far as ""considered desperate"" goes, asking for contact info doesn't make you desperate. Friends share contact info all the time. It doesn't need to mean you want a relationship right away. I understand that you might want that, and that's ok. But it shouldn't be the only thing you want out of this. First and foremost, if a relationship is going to work, the people involved need to be able to be good friends too.

Something that goes along with the ""desperate"" topic; Don't be physical unless she initiates. Don't touch her hand unless it's for a handshake. Don't put your hand on her knee or shoulder, even if she's upset about something and looks like it could be comforting. It might not be. Don't ask for a hug right away, even though I know that's pretty normal for a convention. Those types of things WILL make you come across as desperate, and maybe even creepy.

Please keep in mind that this in no way a template. You should not study this. You should not memorize it. Be yourself and understand that you are both there to enjoy what the convention offers. If a friendship blossoms, great! And maybe it could become more. If it doesn't, that's ok too. More likely than not, you both had a good time conversing and made some good memories."

If the string is loose upon return it's most likely because of a combination of set and low draw weight, the combination of the two being the result of poor design/bowyer skill. Low draw weight shouldn't ever be accompanied by shock because you can make the tips and outer limbs of a low weight longbow extremely light- failure to do so, causing set, is indicative of laziness or lack of skill in the bowyer.

A high brace should always equal a tighter string at brace. If it's looser at high brace something is catastrophically wrong with the bow.

A high brace theoretically makes a heavy draw easier by shortening the power stroke, but a short power stroke imparts less energy to the arrow. The happy medium has been pretty well established at six-seven inches, which is why good bowyers brace to said heights."

almightybob1,atheism,1390987311.0,"Jesus. OK fine, suppose they *only* publish the conviction rate of 30%. That still lets you work out the accused-but-not-convicted *rate* (the stat we are seeking), because the total accused is 100%. 100 - 30 = 70. So 70% of those accused are not convicted, and 30% of those accused are convicted.

We don't know the actual number of cases without more information, but for example if they publish the conviction rate of 30% and the total convicted is 27 people, we can calculate that the total accused is (100/30)*27=90, and therefore the accused-but-not-convicted is 70% of this, i.e. 63.

So from the conviction rate alone, we can calculate the rate we are seeking, the accused-but-not-convicted rate. From the rate and *any one* actual figure, we can calculate the other two actual figures.

This is pretty basic maths."

I wouldn't say a relationship should be a compromise though. It should be something you contribute to because you want the other person in your life. Compromise kinda sounds like it's inevitable and you're just dealing with it the best you can. Whereas contribution is a conscious choice to give up your time and energy in order to have fun and spend time with someone you really like.

JustinJamm,Christianity,1390987382.0,"My suggestion is to look throughout 1 &amp; 2 Corinthians are Paul's instructions for what ""believers gathered together"" should look like.

Generally, in those epistles I see multiple Christians participating constantly, but taking appropriate turns in a respectful, orderly way. It *makes sense* to visitors but doesn't try to reach all possible visitors at all times.

I do not see conversion-preaching, but rather process-edification. It happens to ""edify *and* restore the saints/lost (who are the same group)."" Yes, non-Christians may observe this and respond to it. Yes, there can be explanation, art, etc. that appeals to non-Christians. But I simply do not see that depicted in Corinthians.

Does anyone else, here? Any actual scripture showing non-Christians *being reached out to USING a gathering together of Christians for worship/etc*?"

Once you get to that point, we won't be typing into a search bar to find what we're looking for, so Google's business of selling ads has to alter dramatically in order to still be a relevant revenue item.

My other point about hardware, was about how they would monetise their AI capabilities. Since the ad space has fundamentally changed and I (and I presume the rest of us) wouldn't want to be served ads over a voice-audio cannel then they need a different revenue line. In my mind, this would be selling us the hardware to access their AI, in some kind of wearable device similar to what is in Her, or perhaps printed electronics similar to in the Mission Impossible films that picks up your voice box and relays the answer to a bone conduction earpiece...

lokkenmor,SocialEngineering,1390988035.0,"**Okay, so let's deal with your lack of a clear motive.**

You have variously said that you want to execute this plan because you want to:
&gt;* regain some power over [your] family
&gt;* want to see how they react
&gt;* create [a] web series

I'll additionally make some inferences that you want to do this for:
&gt;* Revenge, because your family trivialises your mental illness and they didn't trust you with the secret of the grow-shed
&gt;* Lulz, because you think it'll be ""hilarious""
&gt;* Money, fame or glory, in publishing the results of your scheme.

If you had just said that you wanted to do this to make your family understand what kind of world you live in, I would have some sympathy but you've intimated so many other dissonant reasons that I think you're just trying to fuck with them for no other real purpose than self gratification and to publicly humiliate them.

**Do I think this is all okay?**

No, I just answered that question. I don't see any good intentions, even self-serving ones. All I see is a poorly thought out, grandiose revenge scheme.

**What expertise do you need?**

Setting up hidden camera so that they won't be found, ditto on the sound. Finding people who would be willing to help you for little to no restitution over an extended period of time, finding people who are trustworthy, finding people to go along with it. Directing the whole escapade, keeping everything organised. Sound set-up, editing facilities.

As you said, getting help from people is the hardest part and I promise you, the second you tell people why you're doing this they will jump ship from the project. Even if you were paying them, they're not going to go along with it. You're one guy, not the whole production company of Punkd. You have no credibility, no prior experience and you're going for the big scoop straight away without any backing.

**Don't I think it would be hilarous[sic] to control these people?**

Not really, because there's no perceptible benefit that justifies the amount of effort involved. Also, you wouldn't be controlling them. They're not marionettes that will dance to your tune as you want them to. They're individual people with free will, you can't anticipate how they're going to react. You have no idea how they would react to the prank if it were executed.

You've said you want people to follow your subjects and talk about them behind their backs. What if a member of your family figures out who's talking about them and confronts them? What is your collaborator going to do then, because in the face of a beating they'll out you, the plan and the whole idea. You'll alienate your family and they won't trust you again.

&gt; **Maybe I am thinking too big.**

That is a huge understatement. You're not thinking at all, you're just asking for validation of your idea and fighting against anyone who nay-says against it, that's me.

**Final point, I can't trust anything that you say**

..because you've admitted that you're a schizophrenic. There's also the problem that you're just a kid on the internet, so you're basically just pixels on a screen to me but you're an unreliable narrator. You've told us all these things but I can't verify them, so I have to treat them with a degree of suspicion. I have no doubt what-so-ever that you're probably relaying the truth as you understand it - you've already intimated that a charge of assaulting a police officer was, to your mind, just you asking questions - but I can't trust you to accurately portray anything to me, other than through your brand of tinted glass. Which throws into question everything you've stated as fact.

It also colours my perception of how well you could execute this plan as the symptoms of schizophrenia, in general, don't exactly lend themselves towards reliability and the ability to see a project through to it's end. The style of your writing is disjointed, very stream-of-conciousness, and  poorly structured which lends credence to the idea that you have the basic parts of a plan but you don't have the ability to execute it fully, or at least to the grandiosity that you wish to.

But I've said my piece, you don't want to talk to any naysayers, you just want validation and approval before you proceed. But you won't get it from me. So if you're determined on this course you go right ahead but I strongly recommend against it."

A_for_Anonymous,AskMen,1390988141.0,"Short answer: No.

Long answer: No, because modern feminism is full of misandrists and people who claim to want to achieve equal rights by only caring for the issues of half of the population, ignoring or most often ridiculing men's rights issues that matter to me, and taking an attitude that revolts me. They hate and discriminate against men and I can't be with a person like that.

I'm egalitarian and want to be with an egalitarian woman, not one that's only concerned with cherry-picking perceived male benefits, much less one that's obsessed with oppressive patriarchy and an entire collection of things that are no longer true and nobody in his or her right mind gives two tenths of a shit about. A less important reason is that usually, The Crazy is strong with these ones.

And of course you have the tumblr-tards; I can't possibly be in a relationship with somebody I can't find any intellectual respect for. I hope they are lesbian and get into relationships with each other, otherwise they'll likely remain alone or end up with a crazy man because no man in his right mind will want to stick his dick into that.

Fortunately, these instances are rare in Europe, but in America you have idiocy such as ""Women's studies"" — entire careers devoted to studying how patriarch shitlords oppress women... I can't bring myself to respect anybody taking such a career seriously, and if I were to take it seriously, I'd ask where's the Men's studies career and complain about discrimination — but I know better: men and non-feminist-crazy women who want to sell fries at McDonalds don't need to go through university.

silverionmox,changemyview,1390988674.0,"&gt; Um. I'm not denying that that WOULD be zero-sum thinking. But as someone who doesn't believe policies like AA actually do that, I don't believe it applies here. 

That's inevitably the result still when you force the presence of a  
quotum of a certain group where places are limited.

&gt;Are you not getting that this is a random example among literally thousands I could have chosen?

It's illustrative for how minor inconveniences - that are easily addressed without legal intervention - are used to support a preexisting favored solution.

&gt;Does the NBA and rap music run this country, run the media, determine public policy, and dictate what society defines as a ""normal"" human being? No, no they do not. 

Yeah, we should skip the elections and mandate the president to be black, otherwise that would never happen...

&gt;Not to mention, a white person entering these industries experiences little to no discrimination. These situations are not analogous.

So when blacks are a minority, it's incontrovertible proof of discrimination, but when whites are it's not? That's a double standard.

&gt;Kind of hard to forget about your race when white people cross to the other side of the street when they see you coming. Or when you get followed in department stores. 

Unpleasant, but no rights are violated.

&gt;Or, you know, shot but it's okay because you looked suspicious and were wearing a hoodie. 

That's a real disadvantage, but it won't be helped by AA. That's only helped by a better trained and disciplined police force.

&gt;How very childish of them to be frustrated at being systematically denied opportunities to succeed

They still are, even with AA. You just fudge the outcome, but you haven't done anything about racism.

&gt;being disproportionately targeted by authorites and given harsher sentences for even nonviolent crimes.

The same is true for men, but somehow AA isn't needed for them.

&gt;Why would black people insist on maintaining this divisive situation when they could just succeed and not have to face racism anymore any time they want?

How does AA address this? If anything it only confirms the prejudice that blacks aren't capable and need to cheat to obtain high positions. It's saying ""you don't need to revalidate after your unfortunate historical accident, just use crutches forever"".

&gt;I think you don't believe racism exists. That's really what it seems like here. Please educate yourself. This is the place for it, after all.

I think racism exists. I also think AA will continuate it rather than combat it. I think people should be judged on their capabilities, and only their capabilities. Giving them a place because they're of a certain race is a step backwards. If the current selection method doesn't give people the place they deserve based on their capabilities, then you should change the selection method rather than cheat the results you'd like to have."

Besides what everyone else already said these three are actually really strong, just unpopular. Quinn has one of the most deadly level 2 all-ins and Kog'Maw has the highest DPS late game of all champions. Again, they're unpopular, probably because it takes some effort to learn them to do well.

""OP"" champions will always exist. I haven't seen a single game without OP stuff in it because it's impossible to balance everything out. Nerf the OP champion, buff the unpopular ones. After people figured out the changes someone else will become ""OP"". Corki was one of the most underplayed champions, then came the Tri-Force buff and people considered him ""broken"" during the world championship. Lucian didn't see much play time during his release. Corki got nerfed in order to balance him and he isn't played much these days. Lucian on the other hand got some bugs fixed and mana costs reduced and now people consider him being ""OP"". Because Lucian is played often Draven's popularity came back since he beats him in an straight 1v1. People who didn't know how Draven works are ""crying"" for nerfs because he's ""OP"". He's not. You just have to know how a champion works and changing your play style depending on the picks made.

Yes, there are a few champions that are ""broken"". Mainly Kassadin. There's a reason for his 90% ban rate. But most champions considered OP are not ""OP"". People just don't know how to play against them."

RsonW,AskReddit,1390989442.0,"I think it's more that it's largely a useless comment to make and one that is far more often than not used to absolve the perpetrator of blame.

As for your first example: someone is bullied for years, what are they supposed to do, *not* shoot their bully? Yes. That's exactly what they should do.


As for the second, you see a wallet on a table, what are you suppressed to do, *not* steal it? Again, yes.

You're attaching an inevitability to the situation that doesn't really exist. Millions of people leave their car running while they grab something from the store and don't get their cars stolen; millions of young women get drunk at the bar and don't get raped; millions of people trash talk about sports teams and don't get murdered. The difference is whether a thief, rapist, or murderer is present.

You wanna know the only real way to avoid crime? Drop out of society completely. We're all potential victims and a lot of people are just plain shitty and will victimize you because they can. So while it's good to try to lessen your odds of victimization, let's not lose focus on the fact that no victim exists without a perpetrator and no one can completely shelter themselves.

You can say lorewise that Omen is a name for a species from the void and basically while other champions get revives, the omen guys basically die and a new one is just summoned. Not sure how they can pass off the newly spawned ones having levels and items though without stepping into kha'zix's evolution lore.

screenmagnet,AskWomen,1390990507.0,"Tons of stuff:
When he drives me around (I don't drive)
When he holds my hand firmly and walks slightly in front of me to lead me through crowds
When he steers me while walking on the sidewalk or crossing the street. I never pay attention to my surroundings or to where I am going and I trust him implicitly to keep safe and keep me from getting lost
When he orders my food for me at a restaurant
When somebody asks us a question, and I defer to him to answer it by peering upward and sideways at him in silence
When he pulls out his credit card to pay, asks for the bill, etc
When I ask him for cash in the morning and he takes some out of his wallet and hands it to me
When he is the one to get the waiter's or bartender's attention
When he goes to get the car and pulls up right in front so I don't have to walk in the rain/cold/snow
When he carries heavy things so I don't have to
When he talks about me to other men in front of me
When he takes care of my finances, comes with me to the bank or other places, and checks over a contract before I sign it
When he changes the light bulb in my bathroom or uses tools to fix my stuff
When he troubleshoots my computers and electronics for me
When we cook or bake together, he is the one that deals with the oven or stove because I'm terrified of burning myself. He also handles the meat.
When I head a bump in the night and he goes to investigate
When I handle the light domestic things (organization, laundry) and he does the heavy domestic stuff (garbage, bleaching the bathtub, getting rid of mold)
When he defers to me for household purchases, and trusts both my taste and my ability to get the best deal whenever we shop.
During sex when he strangles me, face fucks me, forces open my mouth for his cock, and covers my face with his palm while fucking me hard

I defer to him for a lot of day to day stuff mostly because I like the feeling of being taken care of and having him navigate my life on my behalf so I don't need to worry about anything. He is the first man I have felt was competent enough to trust him to take care of things for me (dealing with finances and other real life stuff).

I am actually a quite dominant and assertive personality and in reality I am the true decision maker in our relationship. I am also a natural dominant in bed. But I like him to take the lead on superficial things and I like him to appear clearly dominant over me in public. Not entirely sure why. But he I do need to sort of prod him into it, because I guess it's weird for him to take the lead when he knows how assertive and capable I actually am. He actually defers to me on the big decisions (anything health related, career decisions, and I was the one who set the asking price when he sold his condo and I was the one who negotiated with the agent and handled the offers when there was a bidding war). So he is hesitant to step in and take the lead when we are together."

HomelessPandas,snowboarding,1390990666.0,"Just an FYI, the technical lingo you are likely referring to is skidding or linking turns. Carving is turning at high speed when you only leave a little tiny track the width of your board, and you're accelerating through the turn rather than slowing down.

Practice is the name of the game. It's really hard to learn something snowboarding from someone else, often you have to figure it out for yourself. Force yourself to stay in a dynamic, athletic position, knees bent, shoulders faced downhill, and use your whole body to initiate the turn. A huge mistake people make on the heel-to-toe transition on steeps is that they just lean forward with stiff knees and they catch a heel edge. That's probably the fear you have. So with bent knees, your heel edge automatically lifts off the snow further.

The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.

And that's exactly how it has been. BTW, all banks issue currency nowadays through credit, because the loans they offer are mostly not backed up with real money. In other words, they lend the same money many times."

But I don't see what the problem is anyway: the union is only a small fraction of voters, and it's far from a given that they have the last word in their members' voting choices. The politician has a lot of other voters whom he has to keep into account too, and his budget is limited at any time.

That's very difficult to quantify. I can tell you that regardless of intensity, the battles in the Pacific were ultimately of little consequence to the outcome of WWII. The war in Europe was basically a separate conflict. Had the Japanese run unopposed in their attacks on China, they would still have been hard-pressed to assist the Nazis in the European theater. Japan's power was in its airforce and navy, which would have been of little use half a world away.

&gt; Then may I also contend the universe is itself a system? The conclusion being the universe 'operates on'/'contains' a set of absolute truths.

Sorry, English isn't my first language, maybe I worded it wrong. But yes, the universe (I guess) has some absolute truths, but to show them it needs a human made construct.

I will genuinely listen to any thoughts you have on this, /u/ImmaculateHeart. As I said earlier tonight, I'm glad you posted.

&gt;what else would they have to fall back on except the teachings of the church and the leaders of the church?

YES! You're right! You're exactly right! The memories and oral traditions of the apostles (and their chosen successors) were literally all people had to go on. Even the very words of Christ we quote from scripture are simply what Christ's closest followers *remember Him saying*.

This was passed around verbally, taught and retaught and retaught to make sure it stayed consistent and unpolluted.

**Then it got written down.** Somehow written words get changed a lot less than spoken words -- dunno, seems like it was a good idea they had.

---

What Protestants do accordingly is compare 2 things:

 * **1700-1900/+ years of processing, decision-making, doctrinal updates/clarifications/etc** (the Traditions of the HRCC)

...versus...

* **the ""actual,"" preserved-in-writing records of the apostles' teachings about Christ**

As any Protestant, I simply choose the second over the first. If I were illiterate and uneducated -- as most people were, many centuries ago -- I would have to depend on learned/trained people since I couldn't understand for myself using source materials.

---

So when you ask ""why does everything have to depend on scripture?"" I hear ""why does everything have to depend on the preserved historical teachings of the apostles?""

Or, perhaps another way of putting it: ""why does *what Jesus actually said* matter more than *what we claim he meant*?""

I had a fantastic discussion on this with a catholic fellow here on Reddit about a year ago. He was very forceful with his words and arguments but didn't actually *respond to* what I actually said. Rather sad, that. All his catholic buddies cheered him on, though, which was encouraging and touching. =)

---

Really, we're trying to practice what we believe was practiced in the beginning. Some ways this shows up:

1. We're trying to do what the early church did: follow the authority found in the teachings of the apostles themselves. The apostles' teaching itself was passed down in writing. That's literally what the NT is, in our view: *It IS the apostles' teaching.*

2. Jesus rejected wrongful interpretations of Rabbinical authority, rather than assenting to it -- and his disciples did likewise. We similarly seek to do likewise ourselves.  Yes, those Rabbis canonized the Old Testament, but this doesn't mean the current Rabbis interpreted it rightly.  Likewise for the ""early church"" canonizing scripture.  Jesus and the disciples give us our precedent for acknowledging historical religious authority, *but believing (and doing) otherwise.*

3. There is much made scripturally of ""knowing."" (e.g. Jesus distinguishes between ""the one who knows what to do"" and ""the one who does not know what to do."") Children become accountable as they gain knowledge &amp; maturity/awareness to discern what is right in their own conscience apart from the parents/elders. I believe the same is true of scripture, doctrine, etc.

A_for_Anonymous,AskMen,1390991275.0,"32\. Neither I nor my girlfriend would feel weird if I hanged out with you as friends, and I would want to as long as you're fun/interesting and mature enough for me and I don't want a relationship with you. Best way to make it sure it happens is to ask me to hang out for whatever, but you'll have to make sure I don't think you're asking me out for something more. One way to do this is to make a jokingly remark — but a remark nonetheless, that you mean it as a friend, of course. Use the f-word a lot. Another way is to invite more people over, and the ultimate way to do it is to ask me to bring my girlfriend if I want.

BTW, if you're minimally hot I'll think of you in a sexual way, just like I do for 90% of the women 18-39 I see. That doesn't mean I want a relationship with you, perhaps because I'm already in a relationship, so friendship is possible."
Tripi,Parenting,1390991279.0,"My son is 4 and has been in speech therapy since he was 2. To be honest, speech therapy has been on the whole unhelpful for us. When they are young, the therapy is basically about parenting techniques and encouraging parents to play with their kids and give them lots of attention, which you are doing anyway. Despite me finding it generally unhelpful, I take him because that has been the advice from all the doctors we have seen, and also any small amount of help is worth it, and I can see it possibly being more beneficial when my son participates with it more. Anyway, here are some things which have been good for my son (who spent a long time not talking much at all, and now that he's older talks all the time, but can't pronounce most consonants):

- Play Dumb. Forget to give him a spoon for breakfast, point to a camel in a book and say it's a mouse, try to brush his hair with a toothbrush, put socks on his hands, etc. and encourage him to correct you while having fun. 

- Sing songs. Especially action songs. A small music class my son went to was very good to encourage him to join in group activities and learn lots of language at the same time.   

- Sign language. My son loves counting on his fingers, and even made up his own number system where he would use one finger on his left hand, and 3 on his right to make 13, for example. This sort of thing gets easier as they get more dexterity, maybe your son is too little right now, but it's worth encouraging. You can make up your own signs, or follow something like macaton (which was suggested to me). 

- Due to my son's problems with pronounciation we get him to repeat sounds he can make, eg bubble, followed by something he can't eg bye. So we get him to say ""bubble bye"" as it's repeating the b sound. 

Most of the most successful things we do with our son in terms of developing his speech have been our own ideas, rather than those of any of the therapists he has seen. I wouldn't go for 2 therapists at this age, because there's not much that they will do that you aren't doing already. but there is no harm in shopping around until you find one that you really like.

awelxtr,ForeverAlone,1390991502.0,"&gt;Whenever I hear the ""Friend Zone"" debate it always boils down to. People can't control who they are attracted to. So, I'm sitting here trying to understand how attraction works for women.

It boils down to the same for both men and women. Someone that you find attractive phisically, a personality you find interesting, some common interests and a feeling of being confortable and excited when having the other person around. 

Your problem is that you see a beautiful girl and then the world changes to be around her, this is unrealistic and unhealthy.

&gt;I'm just trying to understand why a woman wouldn't see an effort a man is putting into their relationship and be attracted to that.

The effort is made **after** the relationship is formed, like making sacrifices for the relationship like staying at home to take care of your loved instead of going to the club with the guys. A romantic relationship is created by itself because naturally the pieces fall into place.

&gt; I just seem to be running into that selfish girl....all the time

Selfish? HAH! Being in a relationship is an investment, you risk being disappointed and hurt to meet the person that hopefully will bring something else into your life. If when a friend disappoints it hurts imagine when it's a SO that cheats on you, it's devastating, earthshattering, worldbreaking. She has e.v.e.r.y. single right of being defensive and/or cautious when starting a relationship, so should you.

I believe that you're putting romantic relationships and women in general in a pedestal so high that you can even fathom how the reality of human relationships work and you're forcing every single relationship to be one sided."

pandanomic,MCFC,1390991706.0,"Spurs lurker here, here's my take (since it looks like a lot of people in this thread haven't really seen much of our play recently)

We're on fire right now, and just got Vertonghen, Paulinho, and Sandro back from injury. Adebayor's got a fire in his belly that I haven't seen since he was on loan from you, Dembele is playing better than I have seen in awhile, and Eriksen has been lighting up our attack.

I couldn't possibly guess who'll win this, but I think it's going to be a fantastic match.

Biggest concern for us is Dawson. He's a great captain, but has a massive weakness against nimble, shorter strikers like Aguero and Suarez. 

Another concern is Sherwood's preference of Bentaleb (19 year old kid from the academy) over a DM like Capoue. He's very promising and it's fine against mid table teams, but against United Capoue was exactly what we needed in the midfield to control that game. Sherwood and Ferdinand seem to be of the opinion that DM's aren't necessary though, but many of us fans disagree. Bentaleb was overrun against Arsenal in the FA cup (in a match that was otherwise honestly very close. Their second goal was more of a howler from Rose than their doing). I could see it going better though if he makes Dembele sit deeper.

City will need to figure out how to stop Eriksen's production, something that Toure and Fernandinho are well equipped to do. Eriksen has been our top signing I think so far, even in a 'bad' game against Newcastle he had something like 11 key passes, which is unreal. Since his return from injury, he's clearly adapted to the physicality of the league, playing good defense and also having several successful take ons against defenders.

I'm personally hoping Paulinho gets the start over Bentaleb, that will make the midfield battle very entertaining. The game he was injured in against Stoke, he was having a MOTM performance, with some incredible flair that one could only assume was developed playing beach football in Brazil.

Here's to a fantastic between two great teams!"

JustinJamm,Christianity,1390991751.0,"The sense in which Jesus is God's ""Word"" (which is a metaphor) is not the same sense as the Bible being ""God's Word.""

(Jesus = God's Word)  
+ (God's Word = Bible)  
*does not mean*  
(Jesus = Bible)

---

Jesus is a man with a physical body -- blood, bone, skin, hair, eyes, etc.

Pick up a Bible near you. Is it a man? No? Then it's not Jesus.

Jesus is the ""word"" of God insofar as he *fully communicates/expresses God's exact being and nature to us*. That's what ""words"" do: they communicate.

The Bible *records* the spoken teachings, actions and stories of Jesus, and the application of His person by His followers (epistles, etc).

Jesus *acts out* God's very nature. The Bible *recorded* this. Both are the ""Word of God,"" but in a different sense of the term."

You have to be careful not to over-saturate your marketing otherwise people might turn on your product, and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is a VERY big risk for Disney (almost as big as Iron Man was for Marvel) and they probably want to minimize that risk as much as possible.  It's one thing to say your movie stars ""former WWE wrestler Batista"" and a completely different thing to say ""current WWE World Heavyweight Champion"" in your marketing.  One of them just sounds like he's a much bigger deal than the other.  Just like it's different to say ""upcoming movie"" to ""multi-million dollar grossing movie"".  Both companies probably assume that it's better to wait on promoting for a little bit.  If WWE promotes the film now, and it's a flop, Batista loses that credibility they've tried to build him up for.  Waiting is the safe bet right now."

guitarguy109,asmr,1390991926.0,"You can open up youtube URLs in VLC and EQ it there yourself. Also, programs more robust than VLC have more advanced EQ options that allow you to surgically cut certain frequencies while leaving others undisturbed. I do that for recordings that have too much room echo, if you know what you're listening for then it's not too difficult. But I also find that low bassy rumbling noise such as  refrigerators and air conditioning are more prone having consistent fundamental frequencies which make them easy to EQ without noticeably damaging the rest of the audio. Higher frequency room noise that creates White noise however has an infinite amount of different frequencies within itself and therefore EQ is not the best way to reduce it. Audacity's noise remover is the type of technology that would handle that better seeing as how, as you said, trying to EQ white noise would reduce the sibilance in the video.

We only do 4-4-2 against lower table teams, Sherwood switched back to 4-2-3-1 against Swansea given their possession play and it went outstandingly.

As for LB, Rose is also back from injury now. He's no Baines, but he's young and playing very well. Converted from LW, and generally solid. Hi main weakness is positioning, but often makes up for it with his speed to get back. Our biggest defensive liability is Dawson, who struggles against nimble, quick little strikers like Suarez and Aguero in particular.

Gertiel,NoStupidQuestions,1390994035.0,"Soccer mom is a stereotype. When I first started seeing it tossed about, it was a reference to a basic type. General characteristics of the classic ""Soccer Mom"" type:

Late 20s to early 30s

Upwardly mobile, may run some sort of craft or party business out of her home.

Wears sneakers and mom jeans.

Married to an upwardly mobile executive-type white collar spouse.

Probably well educated, usually at least a Bachelor degree.

Mother to 2 children of elementary school age, possibly also a toddler.

Drives a minivan in the early years of this stereotype, trending toward SUV's in later years
Soccer was the sports the kids would be enrolled in because it was just becoming popularly available in most communities in the very late 80's to early 90's when this term first emerged. Soccer gained popularity for the young kids partly because it was seen as easier for small children to learn than some other sports and also much safer than say football where kids learn to tackle. 

Is omnipresent wherever her children are found.

Though she was most likely to be an educated person, probably having obtained a college degree, she was seen as having chosen to set that aside to put everything into parenting. The classic ""Soccer Mom"" either is solely a stay-at-home parent, or perhaps runs a business out of their house during hours when the children are at school in the early years, trending toward homeschooling from around the mid-90's. 

There is an underlying negative connotation of the mother as helicopter parent. Her kids are special snowflakes deserving of special treatment and special attention, more so from the mid-90's on, but somewhat there from the start. The children are not allowed to do anything on their own and often the first time they are ever seen without Mom right there keeping an eye on them and making all decisions for them is probably somewhere well into what even in the mother's generation would have been considered adulthood.

Tripi,Parenting,1390994096.0,"My 4 year old also has speech problems. I think in his case it's more correct to call it a disorder rather than a delay, because he will talk in full sentences, have conversations, etc. but just can't pronounce most consonant sounds. My son also had some behavioural issues, mainly when he was younger and was part of an occupational therapy playgroup which he hated. He would become very disruptive, try to leave, turn on the tap, hide in the corner, etc. It was very stressful for me, but it was his only way of expressing that he didn't want to be there (I think he was terribly bored with having to draw circles which they did A LOT). It's actually very logical behaviour for kids who can't talk to find other ways to express themselves, so even though your son becoming violent must be very troubling for all involved, it is understandable.  

We started seeing a child psychologist to help with some of his behavioural things, mainly toilet training and joining in in group activities. Perhaps that could be helpful for you also? We found that showing him pictures was sometimes much more helpful that trying to explain things, and also reading books like [I feel angry](http://www.bookdepository.com/I-Feel-Angry-Brian-Moses/9780750214032) were quite helpful.

existie,childfree,1390994337.0,"I'm not currently, but I was in the past. I spent three years coparenting with a married couple I was living/cohabiting with (yes, yes; poly triad, three of us).

I went into it being a fence-sitter. I had days that I never wanted children, and I had other days when I figured I'd be fine having kids if it happened. I was very much a ""if my birth control fails, I'll roll with it"" type. **I am not that person any longer**, and my experience coparenting had a lot to do with that change.

The child in my story was an old 4 when I first got together with his parents. It lasted for three years before I had to bounce. He's newly nine years old and I miss him every day. Sadly, his parents and I are only sometimes on speaking terms, so I don't really get to see him. (They also just had another child, which I find immensely offputting, especially as they're such *horrible* parents...)

What I did not expect:

- I developed a parenting style, and wasn't half bad at it, either.

- My love for him overcame the unpleasantness of parenting / living with a child. It helped that I wasn't his primary caregiver, as I was able to offload a lot of the unpleasant tasks.

- They remember more than you think they do, with far more clarity and honesty than you probably do.

- They don't really care how you came into their life; all they care is that you love them and are nice to them. Kids (especially young ones) are *really* accepting.

- Kids can be *really* fun. I had entire weeks where I would rather spend time with the little guy than anyone else. I never really enjoyed spending time with kids when I was a kid, so this was a surprise to me.

Overall, if I was given the opportunity to go back in time, I'd absolutely do it again. It helped me explore my own feelings about parenting from the perspective of a parent without being legally/biologically tied to a child. I have a lot of good memories that I'll cherish forever.

So far as your situation... I think you should go for it, but tread lightly, and keep your partner informed as to how you're feeling. You have the benefit of him only having his child half the time, so you'll have child-free/decompression/adult time very regularly, which I didn't have at all. You also have the benefit of not being the biological/legal parent- you can help parent if you want, but stay a step or two back so your partner does all the heavy-handed and high-effort stuff. It's kind of a... parenting-lite, or super-auntie role.

Plus, looking at his age - he'll be a teenager in a few short years. Assuming you're in it with your partner for the long haul, the child can really only become more and more independent from this point, so while you'll have to deal with hormone splashes and the teenage growing pains, you won't need to deal with bodily fluids (probably) and the type of tantrums small children throw. I *really* enjoy this age - old enough to take him under your wing and get him into science, books, and whatnot... but young enough for him to not be a snotty teenager yet.

Edit: If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, either here or in PM. I'm an open book."

Then there's hair, people have their preferences (e.g. mine is shaven) and the good thing is that you can choose exactly how much and where do you want your hair. See that absolutely nothing of it is based on your DNA and things you can't change, so women are far luckier than guys in this regard (and so many others).

SpazMonkeyBeck,AskReddit,1390994672.0,"I've never been ON a reality show but I've worked a fair few, mostly the talent/ singing ones. 

Nearly everything is scripted, the 'judges' are flat out told what to say, word for word by producers. 

If it's a show where the contestants need to be divided, they're divided beforehand and 'picked' on camera.

'Reactions' are rehearsed and done over until the shot conveys enough emotion or enthusiasm.

That 30 minute show you watch once a week for 12ish weeks was most likely either recorded in a week or is rehearsed over and over and recorded 'live'. I say 'live' because half the time parts of it are recorded earlier in the day and broadcast as live when the show airs.

Studio audience 'reactions' are recorded as one of the first things on each 'live' shoot an hour or so before showtime, this is so when the audience goes crazy and cheers, laughs, gasps etc they can undercut it with additional audio to make it sound more impressive.

Don't even get me started on their 'backstories' EVERYTHING is producer designed to keep the audiences attention, to keep the ratings up and for the benefit of the network."

If I started to fear for my safety though I would want him to step it up and make the other guy back off.

Same thing if a guy shamed of insulted me. I was once visiting a childhood friend in Europe and I was out with him and his friends on NYE. As I was walking down the street, a couple skinheads yelled a very demeaning racial and sexual slur at me. My friend, who is a very mild mannered, introverted guy (and a surgeon to boot), immediately whirled around and demanded they apologize. They refused, he got pissed, punches were thrown, they pulled a knife on him and his buddy, and in return my friend pulled an (unloaded) gun on them and the skinheads ran for the hills.

Even though my friend was being crazy reckless and needlessly confrontational, I have to admit it made my panties wet to see this side of him come out all of a sudden. He is such a polite and quiet and respectable guy and I never knew he had it in him to behave in that way.

This album is different from anything else in Efrim's catalogue. It's heavier and noisier than anything Godspeed You!

Generally speaking, it's a 'silent' rule of male society that it's not acceptable to outwardly express emotion. It's a silent rule because nobody states it, but everyone reinforced it.

Remaining emotionless (or appearing to) is also a coping mechanism for (i assume) a lot of men. I know I use it as a coping mechanism, I won't burst into tears and cry... or shout in anger, i'll sit quietly with a blank expression on my face an internalise all of the emotion. Because i view emotion as a weakness, something that's essentially been  taught to me through experience."

What an absurd interpretation of reddit's function. All you have to do is read the comments on any popular post and you will find people disagreeing, sometimes in extremely rude ways. These people are not coming together to form a collective opinion. They are using reddit as a platform to voice their differing opinions. Yes, occasionally people will change their minds about a topic or form a new opinion based on new information through reddit, but that doesn't appear to be very common in my experience.

The voting function does not serve to show who's opinion ""wins"", it is only to show the number of people who happened to look at it and agree or find it interesting. And even then there is fuzzy voting done by the system, for reasons I don't entirely agree with, but there it is.

Not sure how I found this sub. I think I found through a connecting post from /r/ainbow but I can't be for certain. As for why I frequent this sub, it's hard to explain. For one this sub has the most tight-knit community that I've found on reddit. Also sometimes you ladies are hilarious and just generally awesome. Seriously there's like 5 of you guys that have a +30 or higher from me on RES.

I've found random movies, webcomics, and other various things in this sub. I guess I just connect well with a lot of you. You're all supportive of each other, listen to one another's problems, try to help when you can, laugh at each others jokes, and celebrate each others success(sex gong). I know it's a little odd, but then again I'm a little odd to begin with.

I don't post much on here. Mostly I just make a few comments or lurk. But I do like coming here and reading some of your stories when I'm having a bad day. Even though I don't know any of you, or even if you don't think I belong here. I also get an odd amount of joy when I see some of you out in the wild in other subreddits.

silverionmox,environment,1390996407.0,"&gt; You are confused on subsidies though, nuclear does not get subsidies renewables does

You're going to learn something more today:

- http://solarbusiness.com.au/energy-costs-shift-solar-externalities-and-subsidies/
&gt;“Despite its increase since 2008, (cumulative) support for renewables (around 54 billion euros) falls far short of the state subsidies for the electricity sector from 1970 –2012, with lignite coming in at 65 billion, hard coal at 177 billion, and nuclear at 187 billion.”.

- http://nexus.som.yale.edu/qn/sites/default/files/Energy%20Graph%202g.jpg
&gt;On an inflation-adjusted basis, we learned, the subsidies for ""traditional"" energy sources in their early growth days—coal, oil, gas, and nuclear—were many, many times what we are spending on renewables today.

- http://cleantechnica.com/2011/06/20/wind-power-subsidies-dont-compare-to-fossil-fuel-nuclear-subsidies/
&gt;Without subsidies, electricity prices would be:
Wind Power: 6-7 cents/kWh
Nuclear Power: 11-20+ cents/kWh
Coal Power: 9-32+ cents/kWh

&gt;I have a problem with renewables though, and that is that while the energy source is renewable, the machinery is not.

That's just one more reason to stretch our reserves of fossil fuels by reserving them for the production of energy-delivering machinery rather than using them directly for energy. This will also keep us below damaging greenhouse gas emission rates.

&gt;The way I'm thinking the tax would be charged at the producer level, so it's just a small number of really large companies.

I was thinking more on the international level. Cheap energy is steroids to your economy.

&gt;The trouble will be import/export. A tax would have to be collected from imported stuff, and a rebate for exported items. This might end up sinking the whole thing.

I'm rather optimistic about that. The VAT in the EU also has a system to pass on costs to the end user, we can use something like that."

1. when the weatherman predicts snow with highs below 50, buy food and water long enough to last a week past when it ""should"" melt.

2. Turn on the radio and check for closings.

3. check for snow 30 minutes before you would leave the house (an hour if you normally take highways).

4. If going somewhere other than your job/school and snow is falling, don't go if you can't walk there.

5. If you see snow sticking and still falling, but your work hasn't closed yet, call in and say you're stuck.

Now I live in a snow prone area and have learned how to drive in it, so it's a little different, but I'm still not sure I would drive in the South just because of other drivers.

tl;dr - There is no good reason to drive in the snow in the South except to get home because you forgot not to leave the house in the first place."

And when I called to sign up with them, I remember them transferring me all around for a simple fucking question. I was transferred in a circle, ended up back with the person who originally took my call, still no better off.

They hung up on me on more than one occasion. I try to be very polite and articulate with my requests and questions, and for them to just hang up on me because they don't want to do their job? Pisses me off.

I've had Time Warner, Cox, and Comcast, and though Time Warner and Comcast are both Satan, I would so much rather have one of them than Cox... Or you know, Google Fiber could get up here... Just sayin'."

I personally make sure every bedroom has at least one window and one closet. A decent sized kitchen is nice, but if it's two people, you should ensure there's a full-sized fridge and enough storage for two people's stuff.

The biggest factor that affects rent is proximity to transportation. Especially in Brooklyn or Queens. If you like 20 minutes from the nearest subway, it'll be dirt cheap. If an express stop is right outside your door, it'll cost you. So if you ever work from home, or otherwise don't have to scramble to the office at a moment's notice, consider a more remote location.

MightySasquatch,minnesotavikings,1390998000.0,"I agree with most of ygrs's points so I won't restate them. I have a couple other things to add. 

First of all I think most economic analysis of stadiums finds that they don't add any (or much) additional revenue, even Super bowls don't add significant amounts of revenue to the state. I'm on my phone now but I'll link the article if I get a chance later tonight. As for the revenue from individual games, studies show it doesn't add anything at all to total revenue. It's the substitution effect, people who go the Vikings stadium aren't spending more money they're just spending it differently. So I think at most we're looking at maybe $50 million revenue which doesn't even approach the total cost to the state and city which will total something like $800 million after interest. 

Also, the main thing that bugs me is that we have so many sporting arenas for our teams , tcf bank stadium, new dome, target center, xcel center, target field. When they redid the gopher stadium they should have combined it with the Vikings, sure it wouldn't have been on campus but I don't think that can justify having a stadium for 6 games a year. Likewise we shouldn't have target and xcel, although I realize that's more a result of the twin cities than anything. "

coolbuns,relationships,1390998367.0,"Wow. That was a lot of insight, I appreciate everything you wrote back. 

That does make a lot of sense. I guess the reason I feel that M does have control over the situation is because she chose to use the information I gave her as a sort of stronghold on J AFTER they had already broken up, the break up that she initiated. She has shared stories of her past relationships with me and it seems to be a cycle she lets herself fall into where she allows her SO to cheat as long as they remain in a relationship with her, but ultimately she winds up being the one feeling torn up. It's really hard to feel empathy for someone who consistently puts themselves in bad situations like this. 

The evening after I made this post I did meet up with J, much to my chagrin. I explained that I had no interest in being friends with M, explained why I was upset, and he didn't defend her at all, which I found even more disheartening. From what I gathered from my conversation with him they rarely share feelings. My boyfriend explained to me that he wasn't upset with me but he wanted me to stand up for myself and explain my side, which has been a big issue as M continues to gossip with the people around her and it always gets back to me, making me more upset about the situation, but at the same time I haven't been taking control. 

My boyfriend explained to me that no one ever told M because they never took J and M's relationship seriously and in the end no one even cared if M got hurt because they were witnessing this constant back and forth between J and M: J being distant (because he was cheating) and M always being the aggressive one trying to make J love her. 

There have  been other times where M has called J's friends (including my boyfriend) and asked them what they thought she could do to make J love her. Recently M called MY boyfriend and asked him why he didn't want to be friends with her after she and J broke up, he explained that he wasn't her friend, he was J's friend. 

I think M has some serious emotional issues that she hasn't dealt with, and may never deal with. She seems to feel like everyone owes her something, that people owe her friendships and that men owe her relationships, meanwhile never meeting the people halfway. This entire situation has given me a lot of insight into what J and other men have had to deal with in dating M, does that make the cheating right? F**k no. "

TheComposer_84,exchristian,1390998910.0,"Your faith or lack of faith in god doesn't change whether god actually exists or not.  Whatever reality is now, is what reality was before… you just have different information about what it is.

If we assume that there isn't a god, you did not suddenly go from being a warrior for Christ to a random organisation of atoms.  Instead you went from a random organisation of atoms that had assigned itself its own purpose based on bad information, to a random organisation of atoms that is yet to assign itself its own purpose based on good information.

I don't agree with the term 'random organisation of atoms', but my point is that whatever you are now, you were before… and you were completely fine with it.  Now you don't have a god that gives you a purpose and that concerns you?  Well, before you didn't have a god that gave you purpose either and you still found one (even if it was misguided).  Now you don't have a god looking out for and making you safe… well you didn't have that before either, you looked after yourself but gave someone else credit for it.

You survived for 23 years without god and thought nothing of it.  You've got all the skills to keep doing it now.

Religion does some good things though… it's great at building communities for one which is probably one of the things you're missing right now.  Fortunately for you, there are other communities out there that would be glad to have you.  Figure out what you're actually missing most and go sought that out.  Which ministries did you get a kick out of?  I did a whole heap of stuff with kids like youth groups and camps and was pretty much the go-to musician at my church for about 13 years.  Now I'm studying to be music therapist and hopefully will be working as one in children's hospitals in a few years.  Did you spend a lot of time praying for poor and needy?  Go volunteer at a soup kitchen or something, not only will you definitely be helping the sorts of people you cared about before, but you'll also be meeting lots of other people that feel the same way.

As to the friends and family thing, that sucks.  However, you are not the reason they're leaving.  It's only been 15 months you say?  I'd almost guarantee you that you're almost exactly the same person as before except for your views on one particular subject.  Unfortunately, their religion did a good job of making them afraid of people that don't believe in god and in your case, that fear is stronger for them than their relationship with you.  They're not entirely to blame for it, so don't get mad at them for it.  Fortunately for you everything about your personality that they liked, still exists in you waiting for the next person without that fear to enjoy.  You'll be fine… especially if you go out looking to replace the stuff you're missing right now.

**TL;DR** There was no void that religion filled.  There was a purpose you gave yourself that you found was misguided.  There was a strength you had that you attributed to someone else.  There was a social group you had made that is trapped by their own beliefs… fortunately there are social groups everywhere.  Work out what you actually miss and fulfil it on your own terms."

buildmeupbreakmedown,explainlikeimfive,1390999078.0,"That isn't a given, because increased minimum wages mean increased consumption, so the larger sales volume might compensate for the lower profit margin per item, making increased prices unnecessary.

However, even if this isn't the case, an increase in minimum wage would only increase demand in certain sectors of the economy. You're not going to buy a yatch just because you earn an extra 20c per hour, for instance, so those items won't see a higher demand. Increasing their prices might therefore hurt sales and not be a good business strategy. 

And some of the extra money people make will go into savings or be used to pay off old debt instead of being immediately spent. This increases solvency, which lowers risk and therefore interest rates, which in turn ends up lowering prices.

Berean_Katz,Bass,1390999439.0,"As a new bassist (I've been only playing for a year or so), I've found that one thing I'm pretty good at is memorizing songs. Here are some helpful tips:

1. Learn to read and utilize tabs (if you don't already know how). Whenever I think up a song that I wanna learn, usually the first thing I do is Google the bass tabs for it. Then I'll copy and paste the tab and save it on a Word Document for easy reference.  
2. Practice the songs regularly. What I do is, every time I learn a song, I'll download it (if I haven't already) and put it in my iPod playlist titled ""Songs I Know on Bass."" Then, I'll play the entire playlist in shuffle mode to practice memorizing them without preparation. Really I just do this for fun and practice, but it really does help if you're trying to remember songs.  
3. Know that it takes time, but be **passionate about learning it**. One thing I noticed is that I don't always remember easy songs; I actually better remember some songs that are a bit difficult, like Orion by Metallica or [Jason Newsted's Bass Doodle] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2KTgi6FD3A). The reason I learn these songs better is not because they're easier, but because I'm much more interested in learning them. I'm a lot less interested in learning 3-note bass lines, so I sometimes forget how to play them (i.e., Blink 182 songs), which is kinda ridiculous now that I think about it.  
4. It's all about the hands-on. I actually have a harder time remembering songs when I'm not around my bass guitar. For example, if I'm at work trying to play the song in my head (which I do a lot, quite frankly), I find it harder than when I'm actually holding the guitar. Something about the *feel* of the guitar reminds me exactly where my fingers should go. It could be muscle memory, or the visual references, etc. Whatever the case, actually playing the song hands-on is THE best way to get yourself remembering tunes.

Sorry if some of these tips kinda overlap each other, but hopefully my advice helps you out. I'm still an up-and-coming bassist myself, but I really love this instrument with a passion, and I guess that could really be the 5th tip: **Love what you do.** Rock on!

tallulahblue,MakeupAddiction,1390999518.0,"missJenFABULOUS. 

She did a swap with New Zealand Youtube beauty guru Shaaanxo. They both decided to spend $400. In the states, you can get A LOT of high end stuff for that. In New Zealand, everything is about 2-3 times the price. 

Shaan sent Jen a lot of New Zealand and Australian products that Jen wouldn't be able to get in the states, along with NZ chocolate, and a perfume. The perfume on it's own would have been over $100. Shaan said she spent more than $400 because she felt bad that Jen wouldn't get as much from her in return. 

In Shaan's video opening Jen's stuff, she was SUPER excited and grateful. 

In Jen's video opening Shaan's stuff she looked visibly disappointed. With every single NZ-brand gift she said, ""I haven't heard of this brand, let me know if you have tried it."" Then at the end of the video she straight up said she was hoping for better, more high end stuff like MAC. Didn't even pretend to be happy or grateful or polite. 

Why the hell would she want Shaan to spend 2-3 times as much for MAC stuff Jen could have gotten herself in the states for cheaper? 

**THEN** when Shaan's fans commented on the video explaining the price difference of makeup in NZ and how it made no sense for Shaan to spend so much on stuff Jen could get herself for cheaper... and that the NZ brands Shaan had sent were good quality... Jen deleted / didn't publish any of these comments. Any comment that made her look bad was deleted. So the video is full of comments saying how Shaan gave her shit stuff, probably products she got for free, etc. Comments from NZers are kept when they say things like, ""I'm from NZ and those are crap brands and she didn't spend $400 on you"" (which isn't true) but comments saying they are good brands are deleted.

...no...obviously not. I'm saying that we should only let the physically fit be in that firefighting role requiring high levels of physical fitness.

I disagree. I think women should be part of the firefighting team, but that does not mean they have to pull adults from a burning building. They can drive the truck, help put up the power ladder, drag and hook up hoses, etc. But to expect all of the women to have the strength to rescue another firefighter who was unconscious is not reasonable. 

And there are a few women who are quite strong in the upper body. 


&gt;  Why is it that when discussing gender justice things, people consistently believe that I lack not only nuanced understanding, but basic common sense? 

I must have missed something. But I have come to realize I have to actually write out things I'm thinking in my head like ""this is what I've seen and read about"" or ""let's explore the other side of this issue"" and I have to be careful to say ""trends"" and ""in general men have greater upper body strength"". I try to leave no assumptions unwritten. 

People can make different assumptions than I do, and I just have to keep that in mind.

&gt; That people can get stronger with muscle-building exercise?

Women, as a group, have limits to the increase of strength they can achieve. With a few exceptions of course. I'm guessing some of the largest women body builders take some supplements that may or may not be legal.

1. Mod queue. Whenever someone uses the 'report' button under each message we can see it in the mod queue for review. If it gets enough reports it's pre-removed. 
1. General browsing, aka 'oh crap, another Bertoncini thread'. Just what it says, mod browsing the sub and notices something that's been a problem before and investigates further, or just notices someone breaking the rules.

So there's no general guideline, for example this thread sat untouched for 10 hours because no reports, one mod noticed and informed the others and then we go over it with a fine toothcomb, removing messages, warning and banning people."

I saw ambulances smashing into cars, cars sliding into buildings, people almost get hit by sliding cars, and I got to watch my fiancee's Facebook stream get flooded with, ""We're stuck in the middle of the interstate, several miles from an exit, and [person needs insulin.""

It's sad.  It's depressing.  And there's not a goddamn thing we can do about it at this point.  Nobody has snow tires, nobody thought to sand/salt the roads (because James Spann, our local ""weather hero"", said we wouldn't get this mess), and only a handful of people have AWD/4WD vehicles.

Several of our close friends had to spend the night in a business who opened their doors or they had to stay in their own place of work through the night.  And to think some people slept in their cars!

We're just not equipped for this.  I'll be glad when this mess melts."

""My reference to the hated and thoroughly despised Erie was somewhat tongue in cheek, but also quite serious. The Lackawanna had since its earliest days provided clean, dependable and fast commuter service despite crippling commuter taxation. Its financial position in the the '50s worsened and led to merger talks with the hated and thoroughly despised Erie. A sellout resulted with the Lackawanna forced to agree to terms abandoning much of their track in favor of the hated and thoroughly despised Erie's. Schedules became longer with the inferior track and more miles to cover. It became clear that this was a takeover, not a merger when the board, dominated by hated and thoroughly despised Erie people, would not accept superior Lackawanna operating and management practices or their supervisors. As a last straw they reneged on a merger condition that after a two year rein into retirement by the hated and thoroughly despised Erie president, the former Lackawanna president would be elected president of the merged company. The Lackawanna's route from Jersey City to Binghamton would have been 90 minutes to two hours less time and 22 miles shorter on better track. To no avail, they spiraled into bankruptcy, Conrail and eventual loss of identity to Norfolk Southern and CSX. Thus the railroad with superior management, route, roadbed and facilities, but burdened with confiscatory commuter taxation (particularly democrat Hudson County, the legislature and governor) succumbed to the vile, hated and thoroughly despised Erie.

These pictures were taken 1 week ago on Saturday night right after I finished Asylum 2 (please forgive the ugly wall color, I moved and haven't had time to paint while I repair more pressing issues).  I had just finished Championship and done 9 rounds of Sudden Death.  

I really don't see too much Asylum love here (sometimes it feels like T25 is taking over here!), but I just want to say that I think if you like Shaun T's style, Asylum 2 is the workout you should all be trying to work up to.  Forget 3 and 4 rounds of Insanity (unless it's a money issue, then rock on!), focus on getting to Asylum 2.  This workout is so well designed and so fun to do, I seriously can't decide if I want to do another round of this or P90X. 

There aren't any fit test results to post in the traditional sense.  Shaun T decided that giving the fit test when you're fresh isn't fair.  He says all through A1 that ""The work doesn't start until you get tired"".   So, at the end of the be all, end all of workouts (Championship), he says ""You did so good, you tied yourself!  We're going into Sudden Death!""

Sudden Death is a difficult agility sequence called ""The Audition,"" followed by 4 Power Jumps, and 2 Suicide Jumps, but instead of jumping straight up, you do an X-Jump.  [Here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNrSdBdC-wA).

**My Results -**     
Week 1: 7.25    
Week 2: 8    
Week 3: 8    
Week 4: 9!    

If anyone has any questions about this workout, please let me know and I'm more than happy to answer any questions anyone might have.  "

&gt; The Damphair and really the whole Drowned God religion doesn't fit the Ironborn very well anyway; who ever heard of pious pirates?

Well the Vikings had religion. I don't think the majority of the Ironborn are hugely devout anyway. People make fun of Aeron's piety. The Ironborn sat a godless man on the Seastone Chair, despite Aeron's protests. Even Victarion doesn't see the problem in two-timing deities. 

It's quite possible they will cut the Kingsmoot but I don't think anything we've seen from Theon's S4 storyline necessarily supports that. Moat Cailin may well be towards the second half of the season. Actually, thinking about it, the Kingsmoot may be necessary in explaining why Moat Cailin is running on a skeleton crew. 

I'm not sure where Yara's storyline is going. She could get bogged down in the North, miss the Kingsmoot and get captured by Stannis in S5. Or she could return to the Iron Islands for the Kingsmoot, then return to the North sometime in S5. Or they'll just cut the Kingsmoot and have Euron take the throne by force.

I agree with this. What I meant to say was, a women on a FF team should not be reprimanded, or passed over for hiring, because of lack of physical strength. There are plenty of other things they can do as a firefighter even if they cannot carry a full grown man. 

Now whether a woman wants to share a bathroom with stinky men at the station is whole nuther matter! lol. (In many departments they eat and sleep at the station when on duty.)

wordserious,AskReddit,1391001209.0,"A young lady once asked me for help with her education. She was recommended by someone I trusted. She made a very good case for herself, she was bright, extremely intelligent, and had awesome plans for the future. So I decided to pay for her education, beginning with private high school. I also gave her a monthly allowance so she didn't have to work and could concentrate on studying. I told her I would support her and her studies through college, provided she kept at it and made good use of that education.

After a couple of years, at age 16, she had an affair with a married man and got pregnant. She said the guy would not take responsibility and had warned her to stop trying to contact him, so she decided to have the baby by herself but she would need to go to work and would have to stop studying, ""at least for now.""

I dropped my support for her. Last I heard she was having a hard time, struggling with a minimum wage job and a small child to raise. Sometimes I feel guilty that I didn't help her through that, but I felt that she had betrayed my trust, and worst of all, her own dreams."
davevd,SuicideWatch,1391001213.0,"I feel like I can relate, I'm 27, and also felt depression since well soon into high school.
One thing I've found with the OCD, is that if you can identify your good and bad habits, &amp; set positive goals, it's possible to be OCD about healthy habits, for example always waking up at 7 and always going for a 15 minute run followed by weights at the gym. These days I need my gym session so badly that I'm grumpy if I don't tick it off. 

With the family thing, try to focus on positive stuff no matter what external factors are affecting your mood... Don't let them break your good habits.

For me I've also found a correlation between depression and my lifestyle. I basically need to be OCD about my diet and fitness levels, in order to remain balanced. Junk food == depression.

A good habit takes me about 4 weeks to realistically set in action, whereas a bad habit takes no effort at all, ie alcohol, cigarettes, online games, porn etc. 4 weeks of denying your brain a instant rewarding habit is f**cking hard.

For me, my greatest concern is being mentally strong, and being able to laugh and love. And by love I mean just enjoying all the things life has when you engage in it, for example I love talking to the girl who makes my coffee each day. I love the feeling of a doing good work. I love impressing my boss...

Anyway what I'm trying to say is that, my depression is very much on the forefront of my conscious mind, and I've been down the dark dark road of suicide contemplation often, and know that if I have these habits and actively pursue to strengthen them... Then I'm not only able to get through a day but I look forward to it. 

These good habits give me self confidence but more importantly allow me to stay centered at work, sport, with friends and family...

I choose my own reality, I fake it til I make it, and I adapt and adjust. No day is easy but sometimes when my mind is clear calm and centred and I experience a positive feeling, make a new friend, gain a new skill, or simply see the world or an aspect of life in a positive way I know it's all worth it to be out of the hell hole of depression. 

Don't expect it to be an easy way out, fake it, read books, change and envision your goals, become fanatical about reaching your goals... Once you realise how easy it is to reach goals when you're fanatical about them... Raise the bar. For me it's an endless battle, but while I'm young and only live once I know it's worth fighting. "

GaProgMan,AdviceAnimals,1391001299.0,"Exactly this.

My younger brother and I were both born with chronic asthma. My mother, a single parent for a large chunk of my childhood, could only work part time (because she was a single parent). On top of providing for me, my brother and herself, she didn't have to drive herself into debt to pay for our meds.

The same can be said when I developed appendicitis. I was rushed to the hospital and HAD to be operated on that day. At least, my mother didn't have to worry about paying for the operation and my 2 day recovery stay at the hospital.

Let's balance my appendectomy against the cost of [this Redditor's](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1tugnm/i_never_truly_understood_how_much_healthcare_in/) appendectomy. I think I win that one.

I was 15 at the time, so I hadn't been paying any contributions myself (I was a school kid, not a full time worker). And, as I'd already pointed out, my mother hadn't paid any contributions during my life time. Yet, I still got the operation and entire after care (including having to stay in the hospital for 2 days) for free.

I've since conquered my asthma (I have occasional flair ups, when I'm running and I push myself too hard, or am running in cold weather, etc.) through my _free_ appointments with an asthma specialist who would guide me through exercises to increase my lung capacity an advice on how to deal with an asthma attack. (without the Internet) Is this possible in the US? Can you book an appointment to see a registered nurse or doctor who specialises in some illness or other, get advice and treatment from them and not have to pay a ~~penny~~ cent?"

Almost in all porn, the actresses  just like have no interest at all for the men and their bodies, just sucking cock, receive hard fucking, and wait for cum shot. Of course Its goes both ways( I'm just talking from my male point of view, you must feel the same way for the actresses) , too less intimacy and real passion. Almost no touching between body parts except genitals and tongue.

PacmanInYourFace,Charlotte,1391001859.0,"Let's be honest, the CIAA weekend is terrible for locals. At first it was about the basketball, and a great opportunity for historically black colleges to have their own March Madness. What it seems to have turned into is all the worst parts of black culture dumped into Uptown Charlotte. At least that's what most would have you believe.

What it really is, is actually great for Charlotte. While yea, the traffic and crowds suck, the revenue is great for the city. Without the CIAA we wouldn't have gotten the DNC, we wouldn't have all this tax revenue to dump into stadium renovations, etc. The fact is that the average Charlotte transplant is an average Midwesterner or New Yorker that came for the banking industry, and enjoys the upper-middle class lifestyle that Charlotte typically offers. So the people that bitch and moan about CIAA are the ones completely caught off guard when a hundred thousand black people show up to party for a weekend and occasionally watch basketball. It's an EXTREME culture shift for a weekend, and takes adjustment. That's why you'll get the people telling you to stay away from uptown and go to noda or plaza or montford or wherever. That's where they'll be, and that's why all those places are equally obnoxious during this particular weekend.

If you want to find the good parties then check Google, my friend. There will be parties hosted by EVERY rapper/video vixen/reality ""star."" They will all cost you at least $40 to get in, and it will be a shitshow.

I'm a local and typically I avoid most of the hype unless there's any good hip-hop in town actually performing, not just hosting. But based on what I've heard and my, albeit limited, experience...DO NOT MISS THE DAY PARTIES. That Saturday every club will have a day party, I've heard the one at Suite is absolute madness so you might want to start there.

As we get into February you'll find more specifics, so keep checking event pages and I'm sure you'll find something you want to do. If not, just go to uptown, walk around until you hear a song you like then pop in. Feel free to PM me if you read about something but aren't sure, I'll happily ask around for you.

Enjoy your trip to Charlotte, and don't forget to watch some ball while you're here.

I'm pretty beat up about it, but she calls me a few hours later and invites me to the mall and a movie with her and the new guy.  Being the high school loser I was, I agreed thinking that ""hey, we can still be friends, right?""  
Didn't take long at the mall for them to say they were going to check out some stores and would meet up for the movie at a set time before it started.  That time came and they were gone.  I tried calling her a few times with no answer, so I figured ""I'm an idiot, but life lesson learned.  I'm going home.""  Just as I'm about to leave and get on the bus she calls, says something like ""you didn't think we'd ditch you, did you?"" and we went to the movie.

Junoh315,pcmasterrace,1391002115.0,"You said that it doesn't happen, let me just quote you on this.

&gt;That doesn't happen. IT JUST DOESN'T.

Even though you have no proof that it doesn't happen.  You're making a positive claim; one that requires proof.  If you said that there is no evidence of it happening then you probably wouldn't have so many downvotes.

I'll give you a couple of examples to show how the burden of proof works.

&gt;""PCs can't use controllers, they just CAN'T."" -Console Peasant

In this situation, the Console Peasant would have to provide evidence since they are making the claim.

&gt;""I haven't seen any PC using a controller so I don't know if they can even use them."" -Console Peasant

Here there is no burden of proof.  While they are incorrect, they are not stating that they are correct.  Someone else can come along and make the claim that PCs can use controllers but then it would be up to them to provide evidence.

EDIT: After re-reading your new comment, I have to say that it's much improved over your previous comment but there are still a few problems with it.

&gt;The burden of proof is on the person claiming that they're paid for a good review, not the person saying they don't.

I've already gone into detail about why you're somewhat incorrect here.  Both have a burden of proof.

&gt;reviewers have more integrity than you think

Well, I am a reviewer(even if it's on a small site) so I know from experience that some reviewers have integrity.  I wouldn't say that all of them have it since that would be a ridiculous claim.

&gt;they do feel they have a responsibility to honestly judge for the good of the industry.

You can't really know that though.  Even if they say they feel responsible to give a game a fair review, they could be lying.

&gt;The closest thing to paying for scores companies do is allowing early releases for positive reviews but this THE REVIEWS HAVE ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE THOSE DEALS SURFACE. 

This is actually where things start getting shady.  This encourages IGN's editors to pick the favorable reviews.  Their review for the game comes out earlier and IGN gains money from ad revenue; it's just like click-baiting.

&gt;In a company like IGN, the employees have more RESPONSIBILITY AND INTEGRITY than you think

Again, I'm not entirely sure this is true.  Some of their employees may indeed have more responsibility and integrity than even I do.  This doesn't mean that all of their employees live up to your standards though.

&gt;there has NEVER BEEN EVIDENCE FOR THIS EVER HAPPENING

Much better but still a bit incorrect.  Saying that there's no evidence technically is a claim that would need proof.  You just do not know of any evidence.  It's quite possible that there is evidence of EA paying IGN for reviews that you and I do not know of."

It's too late for my guys, they're all over 57 years old but the younger steelworkers I really try to encourage to use IRAs and their 401(k), however even the young guys are often too afraid of market volatility to save this money and instead choose to spend it all now.

Just so you know, I'm going to be using this political graph: 
http://i.imgur.com/WDLaE0G.jpg

Not this one: http://i.imgur.com/ZbR0AgC.jpg

I'm anti-minimum wage, the reason is because the minimum wage makes it harder for small businesses to start up. Let me give you an example. 
Lets say you've own a bakery, and you need someone to clean the shop while you make bread, however, you can't afford one due to the minimum wage being too high. While your rival bakery can, so they can grow faster than you because they can split the workload between two, thus allowing for more work to be done. This is called division of labor, it's very important for subjects pertaining to jobs.

Now at first glance, from the workers perspective minimum wage makes a lot more sense.
You're guaranteed at least the minimum wage if you're hired, cool right? Nope! With minimum wage, jobs become more scarce, because the businesses have to pay more for workers, so while you're guaranteed the minimum wage, you'll be lucky if you don't have to sprint to every new job opening to avoid missing your chance.

Believe it or not, no minimum wage *actually* encourages higher wages. more jobs will be available, so the businesses will have to convince you to go them instead of their competitors, usually by offering a better wage &amp;/or benefits &amp;/or work hours.

And that's my argument *against* minimum wage.

Sure most men are stronger than most women, but there will always be exceptions. Even a physically weaker woman could easily take on a much bigger, stronger and heavier man if she has skill and good technique. Speed and agility are needed to compensate for the lack of force, but it is very well possible.

#  
  
I found Twisted Metal (PS3) on sale for $20 on a website for a Quebec based entertainment store, while Futureshop had it for $50-$60.  I ordered it online for an in-store pick up and called customer service about the pricematch.  They agreed, and said that once I picked it up my credit card would be charge at the store for the store for the sale price.  They put notes on my order number so the store employee could see it and avoid any hassle.
I get to the store to pick it up and tell them about the sale and that I've talked to customer service and that there are notes on my file.  They weren't having any of it.  They needed to see the sale themselves, so I give them the website.  Turns out that so many people were on the site for their sale it had crashed.  Employees said ""nope, tough luck.""  I tell them to check my order status for the notes, they said they can't do that since they can't confirm it for themselves, even if it was confirmed by corporate customer service.  I asked them to call, but Futureshop customer service always has a long hold time.  I called at the same time off my cellphone to see if I could get through as well.  30 minutes later, they get through and confirm it with the reps that they had in fact seen the sale and I was right.  Girl behind the counter gives me a pissed off look and says they really shouldn't be doing that for me.  After all that crap, I'd have rather driven to Quebec and picked it up myself.

I agree, though, that it lacked a ""No, I am your father"" moment to really top off the main story's downward arc. IMO, they could've revealed that Bilbo had the Arkenstone already and was hiding it from Thorin (though I think then they would've had to go back and lay more groundwork for withholding it, which would require some better characterization of Thorin). Add in a bunch of ""I will slay any that attempt to withhold the Heart of the Mountain from me"" stuff, and we've got a twist, some risk for Bilbo and the Dwarves (who, by this point, appear to be totally free to waltz away from the Mountain if they so choose), and the first hints towards the eventual Battle of Five Armies."

We really liked the contribution but I'm removing this because I just can't see that it is a 'roo. What's being switched isn't the before and after (both introduced subjects), it's what was said by OP and what was said by the witty redditor.

It would be a roo if OP said ""I put a metal tube of hand cream in my bag and look what happened to it!"" and then someone said ""Yeah, I hate it when it putting in my handbag fixes them""

SeedersPhD,Oreimo,1391003109.0,"Well, a few things we have to keep in mind are:

-Limited Editions and Special Editions. They'll be worth much more, especially as they get older

-Age of the games she owns. Many games would lose their value over time because of their age. However, some of their values may increase because of the rarity of the game (for example, LSD Dream Simulator costs somewhere around $200 because it is hard to find due to only a small amount of available copies in the market)

-What conditions are everything in? (Not like is anything in a beat up condition, but how many games/figurines/posters/people pillow things that I forget the name of/etc. are still mint and still in the packaging and how many items has she touched or used, since a mint item can be worth loads more than a non-mint item)

-How many people are willing to buy eroge in Japan? A small amount of people that play eroge will cause games to be resold for cheap because of the lack of potential buyers

-Same situation as above for figurines, although it depends more on the fanbase for the source material that the figurine is based on. Since Meruru has a large adult male market, the figurines may go for a lot of money because there are a lot of potential buyers.

[What is the value on the special figurine that came from the cosplay competition (did she get that? It's been a bit since I watched the show and I can't check at the moment)? It could go for a lot because of it's rarity.](/spoiler)

With these conditions in mind, I would probably value her collection somewhere near $10,000-$20,000, but I absolutely suck at guessing prices on things so don't quote me on that."

We have a joint account. It's my account, but I don't have my wife's card information. It would be very easy for me to put pressure on this Apple employee to get my wife's card information.

I figured I would throw this out there, primarily because most topics I see are very simplistic in nature, i.e.: How do I get my boss to stop getting on me at work or How can I social engineer a teacher to change my grade.

Nothing *wrong* with those. But social engineering isn't magic. Really good examples are in Kevin Mitnicks book *The Art of Deception*.

I use a second kettle for mashing and made a blanket of sorts out of Relfectix insulation to hold the temperature.  Over the course of an hour-ish mash it lost about 2 deg-F.

So far, my experience has been good with them and the customer service from Spikebrewing is stellar.

Dantilli,AskMen,1391003671.0,"Though that was a pretty harsh way to put it /u/10b-5 is right.

In my experience guys will only block you on something as an absolute last resort. It means there is an almost 0% chance of them ever wanting to continue that relationship. If he is refusing to contact you, you have no other choice but to accept that the relationship is over.

As for how you should move on, you just do stuff with your life. Immerse yourself in hobbies and your job and meeting friends and anything else you've ever wanted to do. Spend your every waking moment doing something so you don't have time to think about him. The alternative is to get into another relationship, but with your mindset I don't think that's a great idea.

Obsessing over him is actually the one thing that will prevent him from EVER coming back if this is just a temporary thing. You come across as very needy and almost like you're dependant on him for... well everything. That is a massive turn off for everyone (at least everyone I've ever listened to, internet people included).

Again I'd recommend working on the rest of your life, hobbies, work etc. Try being single for a while and learn how to be independant again. In my opinion, knowing how to be happy independantly is a necessary foundation for having a happy fulfilling relationship with someone. This doesn't mean you have to stop wanting someone else, that's completely natural, but you DO have to stop NEEDING them.

screenmagnet,AskReddit,1391003696.0,"Med student here. A have a few:

I watched an angry patient pull out her PICC and her GJ tube in front of a bunch of people, and then throw a knife at one of the nurses.

I once scrubbed in on a middle of the night debridement of a necrotic breast flap (a 30 year old woman who had reconstruction after mastectomy by using a flap of tissue from her abdomen). Her whole breast was black and shiny and shrunken and hard. And, of course, it stank of rotting flesh. The saddest part is that this was her third flap (her last two had failed as well).

I also got to fly solo on a middle of the night draining of a breast abscess. As soon as I sliced it open with the scalpel, tons of pus started pouring out and some of it landed on my shoes. The worst part thought was after I was done. She was about a B cup, and the abscess had taken up most of her breast, so there was almost no breast left when I was done with her. She was in her early 20s. Oh, also, we had trouble keeping her under, and as I was cutting into her breast, she suddenly flung her arm up and hit me square in the face. I wasn't expecting that.

I scrubbed in on a severe case of mesenteric ischemia. Necrotic bowel is possibly the single worst smell in existence. And my god, there was so much of it. And, yes, it exploded and feces spilled everywhere.

Another middle of the night case -- debridement of a necrotizing pneumonia from the ICU. I have never seen third spacing this bad (not even in photos). The man's testicles were larger than grapefruits.

First case I ever scrubbed in on was an esophageal cancer and I watched a surgeon stick her entire arm through the abdomen and up behind the heart and saw her fingers come out at the top. That was awesome.

Exploratory laparotomy on a girl to find out why she wasn't doing well 2 days after her surgery. Well, once we opened her up we found out why -- there was an artery that had been spurting blood into her abdomen for the past 48 hours. I never knew an abdomen could contain so. much. blood. It ended up filling several buckets.

A 700 lbs man with the most horrific pressure ulcers I have ever seen all down his back and butt and legs. And his legs...I don't know if it was odd fat deposits or blockage of lymph nodes, but his legs didn't even look like legs. Imagine a humongous leg with a what looks like a tumour the size of that leg attached all along it. The craziest thing is that apparently this man had been able to walk and even go to work before he came into hospital. God knows how.

A woman who came in with a giant tumour on the side of her skull. She had had it for a year, and only just decided to get it looked at. She was totally nonchalant about it, too. It was so fucking eerie.

I once did a pelvic exam on a pregnant woman only to find her dead fetus in her vagina. :( And then I had to go biopsy the fetus by myself.

Helped a woman who had been a victim of female genital cutting (complete with infibulation) give vaginal birth.

Saw a man who looked completely normal from the outside, but his CT showed that almost his entire abdominal cavity had been taken over by the most massive soft tissue sarcoma I have ever seen. It was twisting around all his organs and cutting off the blood supply to them. He was literally being crushed from the inside by this tumour, and there was nothing we could do about it. He probably only had a few months left. I just couldn't get over the fact that he looked COMPLETELY NORMAL from the outside. Like, I couldn't wrap my head around that the scans were of HIS body.

I saw a young teen with a sarcoma that had invaded her spinal column and was knocking off nerve roots one by one as it progressed down along her spinal cord. This are probably the most horrific scans I have ever seen (or will ever see) in my life. Her entire body was riddled with mets. There were mets in places I didn't even know could grow mets. Even the radiologist was like 'holy fucking shit'.

This one isn't gross, just sort of a 'twilight zone' moment. I was explaining to a woman that we needed to do an MRI and she calmly informed me that she couldn't get an MRI because she had a metal tracking device in her body that had been implanted 10 years previously when she was abducted by aliens. Previous to that, I had been speaking with her for an hour, and she had given every indication of being a perfectly sane and normal person with intact mental faculties. I just replied, without skipping a beat, that we could safely CT her instead.

Another not gross but fucked up moment nonetheless: a patient admitted to me that he had repeatedly raped his own daughter. I think I deserved some kind of Oscar for keeping my face and tone of voice completely neutral.

The second worst thing I have ever seen in my life: the aftermath of emergency surgery for acute necrotizing pancreatitis. The pancreatic enzymes had spilled out and rapidly started digesting all the abdominal organs. They had to go in and remove so much bowel and pieces of other organs that had become necrotic. They also had to remove most of the skin and soft tissue covering his abdomen, and left the wound open to slowly heal. So I looked underneath his dressing and there was just this giant rectangle of red, raw flesh that looked like ground hamburger meat.

And the worst thing I have ever seen in my life: a humongous basal cell carcinoma that had invaded all the way through the skull. The surgery involved removing the eye and most of the upper face and skull. There was just this massive gaping hole left, and they filled it in with this big flap of flesh. 

Yeah...virtually nothing shocks me anymore. Good thing I have a strong stomach and the ability to keep it together under pressure. I have never fainted or vomited or gasped or anything like that.

pakap,Politique,1391003801.0,"&gt; Je suis persuadé qu'une grande majorité de l'insécurité dans les banlieues serait anéantie si ça devait être légalisé.

Au contraire (et c'est un partie du problème), de nombreuses personnes dans la police et les RGs sont persuadées que la légalisation du cannabis, en rendant obsolète les réseaux parallèles de distribution, supprimerait un facteur majeur de stabilité dans les zones à risque. C'est assez évident quand on regarde les banlieues qui sont restées les plus calmes durant les émeutes de 2011 (?) : les 4000, Pablo-Picasso, et toutes les autres plaques tournantes du trafic. La violence, c'est mauvais pour le biz, donc les types qui tiennent les cités par le trafic la décourage - sans parler du fait qu'une personne qui vit de la vente de cannabis n'as pas forcément besoin de se tourner vers d'autres activités illégales pour subsister.

J'ai vu un ancien directeur des RGs déclarer en interview qu'une légalisation du cannabis se transformerait en guerre civile dans les banlieues sous quelques mois. C'est probablement une exagération, mais je ne doute pas que ça se traduirait par une déstabilisation du statu quo et probablement une augmentation de la criminalité.

A noter que je serais plutôt favorable à une légalisation aux termes fixés par la proposition citée (cad aux même termes que le tabac). Mais le problème est réel.

You really need to know norwegian.

You don't seem, in my opinion, to have much of a chance if you apply from outside of Norway considering my friend (American with norwegian citizenship but speaks no norwegian) has had one hell of a time finding work and she went to BI, a business school in Norway. Again, she doesn't speak norwegian.

It's really better if you apply from inside Norway, IMO, because I found that many Norwegians tend to skip cvs / emails from non-Norwegians (I mean, with non norwegian names. Immigrants, again from my experience even change their names to be more norwegian. My boss in Oslo told me this, sadly. "

Fetish_Goth,TheRedPill,1391004510.0,"I read a book once called the Handmaid's Tale. It's supposed to be a feminist masterpiece, however it is mainly the author projecting her own hatred of what women have become. While reading the book, it became pretty obvious she does not hate men at all. It's vision is of a bleak future where society has collapsed due to feminist social policy. A fringe group stages a coup to overthrow the government. Harsh traditionalist law is enforced. Her nightmare is not the men in control of the government, but the petty wives and their traditionalist values.

I mention this because your ideal society sounds pretty similar to the distopian society imagined in the book. Simply trying to imagine a feminist's nighmare does not automatically ensure an ideal RP society. We aren't the talaban. Trying to crush femininity is the last thing we want, however it would certainly happen if your vision was allowed to play out. You can't make it law for women to think like men. Women aren't men. In the book, even men longed for the time before, because it allowed them the kind of sexual variety that traditionalism does not make room for.

Free market can produce zero inefficiency, but it won't ensure humane things like proper wealth distribution or an optimal social well-being.

Things that are not naturally good for the market but are needed as a human society (ie. education, health, transportation, etc) do need regulation. If you go to the peak efficiency there, you leave people out. And that's a problem.

In your academic exercises it's typical to play, maximize, etc the offer and demand curves giving you a nice and ""optimal"" result in terms of economic efficiency. But guess what, in that same example, you left out half of the population from that specific market and made the other half pay 30% more. And you didn't even know. All in name of the economic efficiency.

TL;DR Not everything has to respond to the market scheme because it makes a lot of problems in a lot of places. Regulations are needed there."

&gt; ""I was extremely annoyed because I was doing NY1 a favor by rushing to do their interview first in lieu of several other requests. The reporter knew that I was in a hurry and was only there to comment on the State of the Union, but insisted on taking a disrespectful and cheap shot at the end of the interview, because I did not have time to speak off-topic. I verbally took the reporter to task and told him off, because I expect a certain level of professionalism and respect, especially when I go out of my way to do that reporter a favor. I doubt that I am the first Member of Congress to tell off a reporter, and I am sure I won’t be the last.""

yourpants,wow,1391005188.0,"After Deathwing's defeat, Garrosh remained a power-hungry Warchief with nothing to do; he had vast amounts of power and control but no direction to fling it. Seeking a reason to validate his title as a WARchief and bearing an inherent desire for bloodshed and battle, Garrosh bombed Theramore with a stolen mana bomb, thus sparking a new unnamed war against the Alliance.

Shortly thereafter, Pandaria was discovered and all of Garrosh's efforts were directed towards ""painting the continent red"", i.e. taking it over and establishing dominance. There was a large power struggle among the coasts of Pandaria wherein the Alliance and Horde fought each other for control of the island, both with their own reasons explained through the respective quest lines. The narrative began to color Garrosh as a tyrant bent on total destruction and dominance through vicious and irregular means. His ideologies in Cata seemed honorable and reasonable but with the potential for untold strength at his fingertips he transformed (literally) into a corrupt beast and shadow of his former glory. Concepts such as honor and respect were all but obliterated from his mind as evidenced through his actions of massively vandalizing and scarring the Vale of Eternal Blossoms (referred to as the most sacred land in all of Pandaria) simply for resources and territorial gain, slaughtering civilians and even outcasting/murdering his own kind in order to establish what would be known as a new world order made in his vision; ""the True Horde"", a Horde comprised of strictly Mag'har (uncorrupted (brown)) Orcs. These violent transgressions of humanity and atrocities on all contemporary civilizations lead to the Siege of Orgrimmar, a final effort to end Garrosh's dictatorship and reestablish the Horde as a simple band of misfits rather than a war machine designed for world domination just for the sake of it.

What's worse is when they're emotional - that makes them more susceptible to *only* seeing what they have to say. It's the reason I only confront people when I think confrontation is necessary or when I know the person I need to confront think rationally and won't become overly sensitive to anything I say."

Libida,raisedbynarcissists,1391005207.0,"The GC in my partners family made no bones about how she is on the Nparents side and will not hear a bad thing about them. She also will make sure you get 'put back in your place' if you do anything her parents deem hurtful. 

Fortunately I have recently discussed this with her. It hit her when both of her siblings made of point of telling her to F off after the last family shit-storm. I also think she listened to me because I didn't grow up in it and am the most objective. 

The problem with GCs is that they don't always know that they are a problem. It has been put in their heads that the other kids are the troubled ones and they have always had support from their parents. They are under their own form of manipulation. 

He may not even realize what is going on. When you can't turn to your parents it is only natural to turn to your sibling(s). But looking for support from a GC who doesn't recognize they even are one is not much better. (I saw this exact situation with my partners sister. The abused sister looked to GC for support who reported right back to Nparents. She didn't even think twice about it or what she was doing to her sister).

My suggestion would be to maintain a causal relationship. He could come around. But do your best not to let him influence you. Do not talk about your parents with him. If he brings it up, just respond with ""nothing much to talk about.""If he presses it ""complaining won't get me anywhere"" and change subjects. It is OK to have a *no talking about mom or dad rule*. We have one with our GC.  

Being betrayed sucks. Having Ns manipulate someone you love and trust against you sucks. It hurt when it happened with my partner, I can't imagine it from a sibling. But you have a who sub hear willing to listen and lend advice and support. Good Luck!!"

Abbott is pretty much the most unpopular guy in Aus politics - which is odd, given that on paper, he's a perfect conservative.

In the 3 states where I've practiced, one cannot surrender parental rights and be exempt from child support unless another party wants to adopt the child - i.e., bio-dad wants to surrender rights, mom's husband wants to adopt, bio-dad is exempt from support. 

So, while in theory this would be great - surrender all rights to your child, never contact him/her again, let the mother raise the child in peace - the courts are looking out for the best interest of the child. I did work on one case where the father wanted to give up rights - and god I wish he'd been able to, he was absolute trash - but once he was informed he'd still be paying support, he backed down. He's still fucking up both the child and the mother's lives. 

There needs to be some serious reform in how it's handled, but how will we replace that financial support for the child's future welfare? It shouldn't fall on the backs of the taxpayers to support a child that was wanted by only one party who is unable to support that child on her own. "

Word usage changes over time and the current direction of change for this one has been towards using human rather than man when referring to the generic in an academic sense. While you can use either, using mankind will sound out-of-date and gendered to a growing number of people, particularly young, college-educated people in the US.

Then you have the option of taking ""Fan Express"" from one of 5 locations in Manhattan or one of the 4 locations in NJ (this really, really sucks) for $51 round trip.

Or you can take NJ Transit from 1 location, that's right 1 single location, the Secaucus station to the Super Bowl and that is $50 round trip. 

Thinking you'll just hire a limo or a taxi? Nope. Absolutely no vehicles will be allowed into the stadium without a parking pass and further no people are allowed to walk into the entrance so you are stuck with the options listed above. "

The question is what is movement? He generates his power from momentum well does the motion of his lungs stop a train...
There must surely be a speed that comes in as the lowest speed that counts as momentum for the juggernauts power... Odds are if there is flash can go faster and come in before he 'moves' and hit him with a ton of kinetic energy.


Edit: from Wikipedia
&gt;It is possible for an opponent with sufficient physical or mystical strength of their own to turn the Juggernaut's unstoppable movement against him, by redirecting his motion so he gets stranded in a position in which he has no escape; both the Hulk and his son, Skaar, have managed this feat physically,[42] and Thor has managed this feat mystically with Mjolnir.[55][56] The only character to have stopped Juggernaut while he was in motion as an act of pure physical strength was the Hulk while he was War, a horseman of Apocalypse.[57]

screenmagnet,AskReddit,1391005899.0,"I had had 2 years of random excruciating attacks of upper abdominal pain that radiated to my upper back and shoulder. Leaning forward helped ease the pain. I had lost 25% of my body weight without trying. My skin and the whites of my eyes had turned yellow enough that my boss commented on it. My urine was brown. My stools where chalk white and floated on the toilet water. The right side of my upper abdomen was so distended that it projected out more than the left side.

Between various family doctors, walk ins, student health centre, and multiple ER visits, I must have seen at least 15-20 doctors about this issue. Nobody could figure out what was wrong. I was told it was:
- Peptic ulcer, despite negative H. pylori test and no improvement with TUMs, ranitidine, or PPIs
- Irritable Bowel Syndrome
- Muscular back pain despite no improvement with muscle relaxants and percocet
- Anxiety manifesting as abdominal pain, due to the stress of attending university
- 'nothing' since 'you don't look like you're in pain' (that was an ER doc)

Finally, after some googling I figured out that I had gallstone pancreatitis, and started bringing up my suspicions every time I saw a doctor. I was repeatedly dismissed, and said that I couldn't have gallstones since I was so young. (Nevermind that I had every single classic sign and symptom in the book, a strong family history of gallstones, and I was on birth control pills). Finally, I managed to convince a walk in doc to (reluctantly) send me for an abdominal ultrasound.

My family doctor finally read the report a month after the results hit her desk. Yup, it was gallstone pancreatitis and I had passed multiple common bile duct stones over those 2 years. My family doctor finally brought me in to discuss the results, and congratulated herself for ordering the ultrasound that she, in fact, had never ordered.

Oh, then, after my surgery, I went back to the ER 3 times for the exact same upper abdominal pain, with vomiting. They sent me home 3 times and told me it was just pain from the residual gas they had used to blow up my abdomen for the laparascopic surgery. Finally, after projectile vomiting on my surgeon's shoes, they figured out I did, in fact, have another common bile duct stone that had gotten stuck and had now lead to acute ascending cholangitis. Ooops.

Nice touch would be if you knew what she misses from Polish sweets or snacks and try to find it and buy it. You can get rare things from Polish bus drivers, go to bus station when bus arrives, talk to driver, he will get you what you want from Poland next time he will come. "

Eagle-Eye-Smith,arabs,1391006154.0,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Durrah_incident

&gt;The Muhammad al-Durrah incident took place in the Gaza Strip on September 30, 2000, on the second day of the Second Intifada, amid widespread rioting throughout the Palestinian territories. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they sought cover behind a concrete cylinder after being caught in crossfire between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian security forces. The footage, which lasts just over a minute, shows the pair holding onto each other, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, after which the boy is seen slumped across his father's legs.[1]

&gt;Fifty-nine seconds of the footage were initially broadcast in France with a voiceover from Charles Enderlin, France 2's bureau chief in Israel, who did not witness the incident himself but got all information by phone from the cameraman, telling viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the ""target of fire from the Israeli positions,"" and that the boy had died.[2] After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds as a martyr.

&gt;The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accepted responsibility at first[3] and Israel initially apologized for the boy's death but issued a retraction when an investigation indicated the IDF probably did not shoot the al-Durrahs and the boy was most likely killed by Palestinian fire.[4][5] Three senior French journalists who saw the raw footage in 2004 said it was not clear from the footage alone that the boy had died, and that France 2 cut a final few seconds in which he appeared to lift his hand from his face. France 2's news editor said in 2005 that no one could say for sure who fired the shots, but other commentators, including the director of the Israeli government press office, went further, saying the scene had been staged by Palestinian protesters. In 2013 Philippe Karsenty, a French media commentator, was convicted of defamation for suggesting France 2 had doctored the material, following lengthy legal proceedings.[6][7][8][9]

&gt;The footage of the father and son acquired what one writer called the power of a battle flag. According to James Fallows the ""harshest version"" of the case from the Arab side is that it proves the ancient blood libel, while the ""harshest version"" from the Israeli side is that it proves the Palestinians' willingness to deliberately sacrifice even their own children in an anti-Zionist war.[10] The scene was evoked in other deaths. It was blamed for the October 2000 lynching of two Israeli army reservists in Ramallah, and was seen in the background when Daniel Pearl, an Israeli-American journalist, was beheaded by al-Qaeda in 2002.[11] James Fallows writes that no version of the truth about the footage will ever emerge that all sides consider believable. Charles Enderlin has called it a cultural prism, its viewers seeing what they want to see.[12]

&gt;The French defamation case was definitely settled on June 26, 2013, by the French Court of Appeals: Karsenty was convicted of defamation and fined €7,000 by the Paris Court of Appeals.[6] Karsenty's version, which described the killing of young Mohammed Al Durah as ""staged"", was rejected by the French Court's final decision."

Solid choice for profile photo, clear, big enough it's thumbnail works and while the green online button covers up your chin it isn't terrible.   I would lose the family photos, especially the pictures with your sister.. quick match does not show captions and people are going to assume those are dates.  I would also move the family photo down to the bottom and lose the naked censored baby you.

**Self Summary**

Good!  Though ""so smart"" is good out loud, just ""smart"" is better when read.  The rest of it's well written, has a good salting of personal content and a good number of hooks to start conversations from.

I did not see a second photo album featuring your photography.. you may want to remove that sentence till after you've gotten them uploaded to your satisfaction. 

The last paragraph doesn't make it clear if you dabble in drawing anime, or if you dabble in collecting anime.   Clarify that, and if you dabble in drawing, make that second album ""my art"" and include both your photos and a drawing or two.

**doing with my life**

You might also explain why you're 24 and in IT Management, not an IT grunt.. (thought that could just be me wondering since I'm a Senior Programmer who's avoided the push into management for ages)

**really good at**

Humor, hooks, and some serious options as well.. nice.  Please tell me you did not self publish your novel? 

**first thing**

Also.. good. I'm beginning to get a feel like there's too much humor salted into your profile though.. we're sliding past ""oh he's cute and funny"" and in danger of creeping into ""he's not serious""

**Favorites**

Books, all read like the closest you come to literature is graphic novels.  There has to be one book you've read, even for school that has impacted you.. dig into your memory banks and find it.

Film, TV and Music all show good variety.. Food, while it's good that you covered a variety of favorites it seems like your pallet does not venture out of European/American fare.. no favorite foods from the east, or south?  Lack of exposure or actually tried and dislike?

**Six things**

Fairly standard, not a bad list, not a great list.

**thinking about**

Solid, covers a lot of ground, which also helps show you don't obsess over a single subject and didn't fall into the trap of generically thinking about what the future might hold.

**Friday**

Nice.  not spectacular, not horrible.  Could be punched up a bit, but it's almost a pallet cleanser after some of the other sections.

**private**

Good.. enough information to provide the hook, not so much information there's nothing to ask about.

**message me**

A fairly weak finish.. but if they haven't already decided to message you from the rest, I don't think a strong close is going to pull them back.. yours is another profile where a lot of readers won't even make it to the end except to jump down and look for red flags.

SlickKat88,WritingPrompts,1391006240.0,"A dream is a dream within a dream if you believe it to be, do you see?  
Somewhat astonishing the revelations within, do you dare to seek it?  
The price is only a pretty little penny for the feeling of something words cannot explain!  
But, I must first make a point that the things you find may not exactly be considered ""sane"".  
  
SO, with that said, what do you think - feel like you're gonna take a stab at it?  
Dreams can only make you think, so why not *really* have at it?  
Passion makes it ten times ten, over the moon and back again!  
Really, soul, I think it's for you - this dream within a dream times two.  
  
If, by chance, you cannot afford the glory of the dreams of Lord,  
Do not fret, they're only dreams in which he exists to meet others means.  
I have a few I've saved for a while, sometime ago I don't care to recall.  
If you'd rather put up another bargain, I just might consider letting them go.  
  
You know, nevermind, your attention is enough - dedication to the moment is, after all, key!  
So, I'll do you a favor and lend you this special one - why, you ask? Try, and you'll see.  
I can't say much more but to save up your coins, I'll be here awhile and ya might see me again.   
But, do me a favor and keep an eye out - it's quite easy to lose your sanity, my friend.  
  
Oh, and before I forget kid, you'll find one day that I'm a figment of your imagination.  
No one knows that I sell these dreams, and those that do wind up in tragic situations.  
So, before you go in awe and tell others about that there special dream I gave you...   
Remember that I loaned you that, and I'll get paid if it means hanging you.

IMO, PJ is a brilliant cinematographer.  His vision of Middle Earth is fantastic in terms of locations, sets, costumes, etc.  He's pulled off some amazing scenes that give me feels every time I watch the movies, like the Ride of the Rohirrim or Frodo and Sam on the slopes of Mount Doom.  Unfortunately he seems to think he's as talented with a pen as with a camera, which just isn't the case.  I could probably rant for days about the plot and character changes that he's made to Tolkien's work, but even if you ignore the source material when looking at the movies so many of the choices just don't make a lot of sense.

Still though, I still consider the LOTR trilogy to be great movies, and I would call AUJ and DOS good movies.  Unfortunately with the latter two it's painfully obvious that they are stretching to fill three movies, which makes the weakness of the writing more apparent."

Those yellow images you see are the actual color of the items. You need to set your color to the proper temperature to get them to be white. Your problem is that the manual shows yellow... that is because you manually did not set the proper temperature of the light source. Auto is doing a fine job because that is what its meant to do. So the problem is that AUTO is doing a great job and MANUAL is making errors, then you need to correct your manual inputs. What is the temperature of the auto and what temperature are you setting yours to when you take the same picture?

What is the better alternative? Plant vegetation in your backyard that provides a good habitat for song birds and squirrels.

That's not a particularly small thing, given the media play it's given. He did it without getting us into any conflicts, without causing deaths. He simply took a hard line with Indonesia and moved where the refugee processing centres are. 

You think a science minister does much of anything? Politicians don't conduct research. Funding is still going to the CSIRO, there's just fewer political fingers meddling. Gay marriage and MJ? Either Gillard or Rudd could have passed it at *any time*. The Libs couldn't have stopped them. Labour was *happy* about passing more legislation during their terms than any other group had. But for some reason, they *didn't* pass these. 

Couldn't possibly have been so they'd have something to beat conservatives with, could it? 

The ABC? Seriously? They're the media equivalent of Reddit. They are *solidly* left wing. And the previous labour governments were actively threatening any media company that printed things they didn't like. Did you forget about that?

Net speeds. Well, here at least, the Libs policies are crap. If they're going to run fiber everywhere, then run it everywhere, not just to central nodes. But, as far as Labours policies towards it, at the time of the election, after they'd already started laying fiber, they *still hadn't figured out how they were going to pay for it*.

TL;DR Abbott is a tool, the other side were worse, and most of the opinions being thrown around here are the type of shit that gets spouted by the Greens/Socialist Alliance/Communist Party at RMIT. And I mean that literally."

Mainstream pundits would have you think it means a handful of monopolies running everything, an idea that Democrats despise (unless it's their monopoly) and Republicans love (unless it's someone else's monopoly). 

However, this shows a complete lack of understanding of economic history and theory. The truth is, in any place where a market is dominated by a few firms, you can observe the legal situation and see that it is always wound up in a sea of regulations.

This goes back all the way back to the Gilded Age. Hardly a time of laissez faire, in fact, that was exactly what the robber barons didn't want. Instead, they prospered through monopoly privileges granted to them by the government, mainly land monopoly (rent-seeking on land you don't use), patent monopoly (monopoly privilege on ""intellectual property""), currency monopoly (state supported banking cartels), and tariff monopoly (the monopoly like privilege of protectionism). The Progressive Era was not the work of a populist government working in public interest but rather the work of big business trying to even more greatly control society.

These monopolies continue today, albeit evolved. Far more important than picking apart regulations on how big business can use privileges is repealing all of them to begin with.

I predict that in the absence of all privileges to businesses, followed by the repeal of all regulations, a free market would consist of numerous small firms flooding the market, large firms being largely worker owned, and most economic life taking place locally as someone self employed or in a co-op. Labor rights would also flourish with the repeal of labor legislation, which is merely a wolf in sheep's clothing to protect big business unions and not actually help laborer. With the repeal of restrictions on unionization,  unions would become a much more prominent part of society. A genuinely freed market is a good thing, but the ""free"" market of big business politicians is neither free nor good.

**tl;dr**: A free market is not privileges to businesses like most people think but rather the absence of privilege, which big business won't let happen."

You kidding? Assholes are applauded on the daily in TRP. They're alpha, after all. 

I very much agree with what you've said though. I know dozens and dozens of women who are perfect examples of what TRP thinks ""all women are like"". But on the contrary, almost every woman I've ever been involved with is what they would call a ""unicorn"".

TRP is far from devoid of good content. There's lots of good advice for self-improvement, getting laid, and protecting yourself legally in relationships. But it's always a huge joke to hear them try to say they don't hate women. They absolutely despise women because they haven't met enough unicorns. And this might have a lot to do with the fact (at least in my opinion) that intelligent women can see right through alpha bullshit and want to steer clear of men who act that way."

I'm an assertive person and one thing I absolutely cannot tolerate is being taken advantage of. My aforementioned cousin is the epitome of the superiority complex. She's insecure and insolent and almost everything she does is done to place herself on a pedestal she's just cannot create for herself. In recent months I have become incredibly confrontational thanks to her because she's decided to make me public enemy no. 1. However, because she is irrational and sensitive I have to go about it in a tactful manner -- I don't confront her about things she says/does to myself about myself, I confront her on her behaviour toward her own life, her family and those closest to her.

As you said, when there's something to gain is when confrontation is worth the hassle and the effort. At the worst times I'm rageful and aggressive but when I present myself to those I'm confronting I keep my cool because I know it's what is necessary to destroy them.

There was an article about this a while back by The Huff and they started with sensationalist bullshit like the 0.77 figure and eventually came to something a bit more grounded in reality that showed the gap is exaggerated by and far but from the brief amount of information I could see I would have liked to see a deeper study. In a number of areas there wasn't a significant difference though. However I don't think the Huff article emphasised what information to pay attention to most though.

Omega037,changemyview,1391006919.0,"&gt; I could take 1/10th of the money it takes to go to college and spend a month ""experiencing"" the best museums and libraries in Europe, and probably end up a better person than sitting through environmental ""science"" classes.

Not that there isn't anything to be gained through such an experience, but trying to compare visiting some museums in Europe with a formal, structured class taught by a Professor with a doctorate in the field is very different.  They may compliment each other, but they aren't even close in terms of breadth or depth of learning.

You won't be expected to formulate and write a coherent argument through research and critical thinking in a museum, for instance.  Nor would you get useful feedback on that process.

You also seem to underestimate the costs of traveling to/around Europe and having to live and eat there for 4-5 months, which is what you are talking about comparing.  

&gt; As a parent to a college student for the last 4 years - a year in private school costs $50k+. At least. Now, AVERAGE college loan - including what parents paid, and people who went to school ten years ago when college was half the cost may be low, but if you were to go to school TODAY you will be spending quarter million dollars in TODAY's money.

Only a small fraction of schools cost over $50,000 a year, and certainly not most of the schools that the vast majority of people go to.  This is like complaining about the cost of cars being $400,000 because you tried to buy a Lamborghini.  I mean, we have real statistics about this:

**According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2013–2014 school year was $30,094 at private colleges, $8,893 for state residents at public colleges, and $22,203 for out-of-state residents attending public universities.**

So for a the majority of people, it is under $10,000 a year for tuition.  For people in private schools, it is $30,000 a year.  Please stop saying ""$50,000 at least"" when that is the exception, not the rule.

What you are doing is including the cost of normal living (e.g., housing, food, entertainment), but forgetting that this person would still need a place to live and food to eat regardless of whether they were in school or not.

Regardless, your view is basically about whether people should go to college directly out of high school rather than waiting a bit.  You didn't specify that this only applied to obscenely expensive private colleges, so taking the average in-state tuition is fine.  Going to a decent to good state school for four years would cost you around $36,000 total, which isn't a bad investment.

&gt; Ummm, will PhD from University of Phoenix work? Can you comment on your profession, actually, I have never heard of hiring PhDs as a criterion in a non-research establishment.

I do Predictive Analytics, as my PhD focused on machine learning in biomedical applications.  I went to SUNY Binghamton, which is probably  on of the best public schools in the state.  There are some people with only a Master's on the greater Analytics team, but as they are building up they basically use a PhD as a baseline credential for new people.

&gt; Believe me, it is a much better ""trade"" than waiting tables after getting a degree in environmentalism

So is welding, which is my point.  However, the real problem is that you are creating a straw man here.  There are plenty of engineers living with their parents and waiting tables.  Just like there are plenty of people who majored in Environmental Science or Sociology who have good jobs doing something they wanted to do.

Besides, it doesn't go to your view at all, which is about uncertainty when choosing a major.  After all, someone could really want to do Environmentalism after taking a couple years off and exploring."

dunnoyabassa,INTP,1391007035.0,"&gt;how do you determine offensiveness?

when a person becomes offended they determine something to be offensive.

&gt;who decides?

individuals who are offended.

&gt;is one party right?

no.

&gt;is one party wrong?

not objectively because everything is arbitrary when reduced to fundamentals.  however, when a well established pattern of behavior tends to offend many people it is typically considered rude to engage in such behavior.

&gt;despite non inflammatory rhetoric on my part am I automatically suppose to apologize when someone claims offensive?

you don't HAVE to do anything when it comes to other people.  as an a human being you have the ability to kill other people.  as a reddit-using citizen of some nation you likely have enough legal freedom to be a douchebag to a certain extent.  assuming you're not one to believe in the supernatural (need i bludgeon the point: religion falls into this category) there isn't some real objective moral code that says ""this is what people are supposed to do.""

however, your actions have consequences and when you choose to do or say certain things one of those consequences can be ""offending others.""  there's no law against being offensive, but if you've offended someone there's also no law that says they have to continue to like you.  if you don't like the consequences of offending someone an apology is often a good means to fixing the issue.  if you don't mind the consequences of offending someone you have no obligation to apologize.

&gt;how would anything be discussed?

if benign difference of opinion is offensive to someone it's likely they aren't looking for discussion.  it's much more likely they are looking for empathy.  if you do not care to validate their emotions with attempts to empathize and they don't care to discuss ideas your companionship might be incompatible."

superior22,summonerschool,1391007038.0,"One of the biggest reasons why I take teleport into top lane 99% of the time. And because I'm not really a big fan of Ignite. You've killed your enemy laner, took his tower, pushed the wave out, teleport into bot lane, take a double kill, take the tower and a free dragon. If mid lane is pushed rotate over and take mid tower. Jax eats towers for breakfast. You should have some nice gold to spend on items, grab a couple wards and go for that t2 top tower. Once teleport comes off cooldown focus on bot (or mid) lane again, probably take another kill, next tower and another free dragon. You don't just pressure top, you pressure everywhere! 

In your situation you should have probably roamed more often to mid lane. I'm actually curious how an Annie (or a Caitlyn) could kill you. Jax is one of the most disgusting match ups for ADC's, fed or not. Didn't you have any defensive items?"

codayus,javascript,1391007094.0,"Um...this **is** a promise implementation.  But I don't think it's very good.

    harvest.let('father', loadPenguin, 'MrPenguin');
    harvest.let('mother', loadPenguin, 'MrsPenguin');
    harvest.let('family', loadPenguinFamily, wait('father'), wait('mother'));
    harvest.do(function(family){
      console.log(family);
    }, wait('family') );

That's okay, but why not just

    father = loadPenguin('MrPenguin')
    mother = loadPenguin('MrsPenguin')
    family = Promise.all([father, mother]).spread(loadPenguinFamily);

    family.then(function(val){console.log(val)});
    
It's a bit shorter, just as readable, and has very similar principals (eg, you say ""this will be an answer one day"", then use .then or wait() to wait until it actually is).  But it has one big advantage:  All the promises are actual JS variables.  You can loop over them, run map on them, find the length, and generally treat them as variables.

Imagine we have something like this:

    penguins = ['George', 'Mike', 'Tom', 'Mary', 'Fiona', ....... etc]
    
    Promise.all(penguins).map(function(name){
      return loadPenguin(name);
    }).filter(function(penguin){
      return penguin.breed === 'Emperor'
    }).map(function(penguin){
      console.log(penguin.age);
    });

That will print the age of every Emperor penguin in the list (assuming that the Penguin model has age and breed fields...).  How would you do that with harvest?  Looking at the API, it looks like it'd end up being longer and uglier than the Promise example.

So, let's flip it around:  What do you gain from not using a standard Promise lib like Bluebird?  It doesn't seem more concise or clearer.  Is it faster?  What?"

Dsf192,stunfisk,1391007326.0,"The team I use in Singles goes like this:

**Dragonite** @ Lum Berry

Ability: Multiscale

Nature: Adamant; EVs: 252Atk/236Spe/40HP

- D-Dance

- Fire Punch

- Earthquake

- Outrage

I lead with this guy.  Lum Berry + Multiscale guarantees a DD.  The Speed is enough to out-speed a Weavile at +1.  If Dnite can't handle a Pokemon easily enough (say Lati@s) then I switch out to one of my following Pokemon.  Outrage instead of D Claw since it's singles and most fairies/fairy moves can't OHKO him.

**Greninja** @ Life Orb

Ability: Protean

Nature: Timid; EVs: 252SpA/252Spe/4HP

- Surf

- Ice Beam

- Dark Pulse

- Grass Knot

Typical Greninja.  Strong and fast, but frail so watch out.

**Scizor** @ Scizorite

Ability: Technician

Nature: Adamant; EVs: 252HP/252Atk/4Spe

- Swords Dance

- Bullet Punch

- Brick Break

- U-Turn

This is typically the guy I send it if Dnite can't easily KO the front runner.  Usually start with a SD/Mega Evolve and then slay the opponent from there.  If SD isn't needed, then I skip it.  I usually try to U-Turn back to Dnite after the threat is taken down.

~~~

This team has won me some good successes.  I got cocky one time and thought Latios wouldn't OHKO through Multiscale.  I was wrong, don't make that mistake.  If you aren't 100% certain that Dnite can easily handle the opponent (and he can do that for most of them) then switch."

That being said, I think that certain blink initiators like Earthshaker, Tidehunter, Magnus, Sand King, Enigma, etc. will be able to situationally skip or delay Arcanes, but I don't think that it should always be the end-all decision due to the mana cost change. If your team is hungry for mana or either team is delaying teamfight opportunities (by splitpushing or jungling), I think its okay to grab up the Arcanes in the same order as you would pre-6.80. The mana is still very important on mana hungry gankers and carries.

She personally went to the school board to try to appeal the decision, saying that I was struggling to keep up in class and that she was barely keeping me from flunking out, so there was no way I would be able to skip a grade or keep up with gifted level coursework.

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1391007523.0,"I think that's an important detail that a lot of people neglect when discussing not just rape cases, but crime and punishment in general.

1. We operate on a system where we only punish those we believe to be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Meaning if there's a reasonable chance they're innocent, we don't do shit to them. We prefer to let the guilty go than to punish the innocent.  
2. An attorney's job is to convince the judge/jury of their case. This is a no-holds-barred war of wit. If they can convince the jury that someone is batshit fucking crazy, it doesn't matter if they actually are or not, it matters that the jury is convinced.
3. Given this, in instances of rape cases, if I'm defending a rapist, my job is to convince the jury that my client was completely under the impression you consented. I will lie, I will manipulate your emotions, I will completely fuck you over because that's my job.

I'd like to note that I only used the first person in the third point for clarity, I am not a lawyer nor would I defend a rapist."

portugalthephilosoph,Republican,1391007777.0,"A few tips from a former Political Director for 2 Congressional campaigns and the Romney campaign:

* READ. Learn everything you can about campaigning. There are TONS of good books out there that can help you. The number one book I would suggest is *Get Out the Vote!* by Alan Gerber and Don Green.

* Know your district. Ideally, you've grown up there your whole life and already know it. If you didn't, then GET TO KNOW IT. Every major historical event, major figures, current elected officials, issues unique to the area, etc.

* **Get out there**. If you read Gerber and Green's book, you'll see that getting out and hitting the streets is the number one thing you can do to get votes going your way. Montana has pretty spread out houses in the rural areas, but if you're running in a city like Missoula, Butte, or Billings, then your district is small enough for you to knock on every door, several times. And ALWAYS make sure you have something to leave with them.

* Don't underestimate the importance of fundraising. Set up a good website for yourself with Paypal functionality. And *make sure* to fill out all of your financial reports *perfectly*. You will need money to spend on campaign literature, yard signs, and direct mail. Which brings me to....

* Get your name out. Unless you're a local hero, most people in your district won't know your name. That is your number 1 priority: get your name out there. People should walk into the voting booth on election day and say ""oh, I know this name. I've seen it all over town."" In a state level race, most people vote for the name they recognize--not the issues.

* To get your name out, you need *collateral* with your name on it. Yard signs, bumper stickers, and palm cards. These can be acquired pretty cheaply, but make sure they are done PROFESSIONALLY. Do NOT print your own campaign literature at Kinko's. There are several great consulting firms in Montana (and other states, don't feel obligated to hire someone close) that will give you a good deal on campaign lit. 

* **DIRECT MAIL**. Other than knocking on someone's door and speaking to them personally, Direct Mail is your most useful tool. It is cheap, compared to other forms of advertising, and has a bigger impact than something like a radio ad or a billboard (but those are useful too).

* Be yourself. I should have put this at the top, but its been said many times on this thread already so whatever. People vote for a candidate that they see as honest, and as someone they can identify with. Be real, be compassionate, and above all, LISTEN more than you TALK. Voters will notice.

* You should be going to every campaign event possible. If you really want to win this race, you are going to have to work your ass off. Give yourself Sundays off, but don't rest another minute. 

* You should also get to know as many of the other state legislators, county commissioners/other office holders, party officials, and local stakeholders as possible. These people are great assets. Having just a few of them on your side can make a big difference, because they have 1. been there before you and 2. knowledge of who has the extra money to help your campaign.

I applaud you for taking up this task. It is not as easy to run a successful campaign as some people seem to think. I also commend you for no longer complaining, and getting out and doing something about it. We need elected officials like this. 
I have never personally done any work in Montana, but the consulting firm I worked for last year just started branching out up there, and they do great work (although it is pricey). 
If you have any other questions, we're here for you. And if you don't mind providing me with more details about your district and your race, I would be happy to give any more advice I can think of. "

ta1901,AskMenOver30,1391008120.0,"&gt; If you read the popular dating books, everything from the repressively Victorian The Rules to the recent and hip He's Just Not That Into You tells women to ask men out at their peril. No long-term, healthy relationship can result when a woman makes the first move they claim.

*The Rules* is one of the most bass-ackwards books I've ever heard of. Do you really think these books follow sound and proven psychological principals of healthy relationships? 

&gt;  Is there a valid reason I shouldn't ask a man out dancing or to a concert? 

No, I like assertive women. Really I'm just looking for clear communication. Communication is the foundation for a solid relationship. 


&gt; BTW, I've never been married, enjoy my ""free agent"" status, and am not trolling for a hubby--but what if I were? 

It's unlikely you would know if you want to marry someone after even 2-3 months of dating. So it's a non-issue early on. But if you want to start by dating casually, just say that. That's reasonable. And if you find someone really compatible, say you're open to marriage. Be specific. Don't allow the guy to make assumptions about anything.

You will then notice choppiness/lagging thanks to said  predictive analysis. But if you're running at a constant high FPS, this is mitigated because you're running at too high of an FPS for your eyes to notice the change. Of course, having 300+ fps is just ridiculous, even if you'd have a monitor that could display it, but for a truly smooth experience I'd at least recommend a minimum of 120 fps/hz."

This is not how cost/benefit analysis works, and it boggles my mind that so many people seem to think that it is. It's easy to say that for one thing, it's better to be safe than sorry, but when there is nothing to indicate that you're actually taking a safer stance, that is not what you're doing. And it's something that could be applied to anything. If I tell you that I heard from a friend that his mom's friend's cousin once had LEGOs in her house while she was pregnant, and that her child was born a horrible mess, would that mean that ensuring your house was LEGO free was a case of being 'better safe than sorry'? NO! Because there is nothing there to actually indicate danger. And you can't go around removing everything that is *potentially* dangerous from your life."

An example:  Employees who contribute more to profitability are more valuable to employers.  Generally speaking (assuming everything else is equal), employees who contribute more hours to their work contribute more to profitability.  Ergo, employees who work more hours, earn more money.  That is true regardless of gender.  If, on average, men work more hours than women (and I'm fairly certain the evidence supports that, on average, they do), it makes more sense that men would earn more money than women.  Just like if 40 year olds work more hours than 16 year olds, it makes sense that 40 year olds would earn more money (and they do... and it has nothing to do with discrimination against 16 year olds)."

sheenathepunkrocker,TumblrInAction,1391008382.0,"Right? Story time, about 11 1/2 years ago my dad had a heart attack. He is a runner and had been training for a marathon that summer, so he was in excellent cardiovascular shape (well, other than the fact that he had a blocked artery). In the weeks leading up to his heart attack, he had been seeing a cardiologist for chest pains, but most of his tests were coming back pretty normal. His artery was about 99% blocked when he went to the hospital.  Usually this would deadly, or at least require a bypass, which is when doctors take a vein from another part of your body (usually a small one from your arm or something) and use it bypass a blood clot in another artery. Instead of having surgery, he ended up with a stent, which is basically a piece of metal that holds an artery open.  His doctor told him that being in shape and running probably saved his life.  He stills runs, and is now in outstanding cardiovascular shape and health, especially for someone who has heart disease.  It really pisses me off how these people will dismiss the importance of being in shape to overall health, since regular exercise literally saved my dad's life.

Scale back the eyeliner, your top line is too thick and harsh, try just going in your lash line and ""tight line"" your upper lid. Your lashes will look fuller and you won't look overly made up.
You can ditch the bottom line entirely or just lightly line the outer 1/3. Going the whole way should be reserved for smokey eye looks, and with this critique I'm leaning toward a daily looks for you.

How this is received depends on how it works....do you look at the spreadsheet, or does a macro or some other script?

Alcohol is on the same level of non-issue as anything else that will not harm your baby. Like drinking milk, or having sex, or watching TV. Sure, you can remove one without issues, but why should you when there is absolutely no reason to? And when you start removing more and more things, your life is going to start feeling empty.

paperclip1213,intj,1391008630.0,"I do this far too much although with most people it's usually more an observation than something that *really* gets to me. In these situations I'm likely to tell myself ""they're only human"" (and other bs justifications like this) so that I don't overthink it. Oftentimes I use it as a way of getting myself to understand the human mind better.

With certain people their flaws are something I can't let go of because they're just so different to what I'm used to. Although ""opposites [may] attract"" (again, bs justification), entirely accepting these flaws, or 'quirks', and moving on with my life is something that I'm incapable of doing. For example, I just replied to a reply in my ""Are you confrontational?"" thread where I described one of my cousins as having a superiority complex and being irrational and insolent. In my opinion these are her major flaws because she destroys anyone she's able to. Their family have stayed in my house for about 5-6 weeks throughout the last 2 months and for the entire time I stayed away from them and spent all the time in my kitchen or my room -- anywhere where they weren't because seeing her behaviour and hearing her speak makes my head burn and my ears bleed. It amazes me how stupid a person can be. It's people like her (who are a rarity in my life thanks to my being a loner) that never cease to amaze me in how they allow their flaws to consume them. I consider myself a humanist and somewhat of an optimist because I want to believe that people are growing and making themselves into something better but people like my cousin really fuck around with these ideals and beliefs.

If picking up on flaws makes me an asshole, then so be it. I'd rather be hyperaware of a person so that I can protect myself from the bullshit they have to bring. Argh. Thinking about my cousin has now put me in a bad mood.

Deadbolts are generally located at 3'6"" to 4' from the ground, so a well executed kick at this height would require one's waist to be at comparable height or higher, otherwise force is being applied upwardly, rather than laterally. Being shorter would make executing kicks at the necessary height more difficult, and even if a person at, lets say 5'4"" could kick with the same or slightly greater force than someone at 6'4"", they would still have more difficulty breaking down a door than their taller counterpart.

I also taught him the word ""potty"" (praising him and using the word every time he relieved himself). He'd signal that he wanted to go outside, and I'd let him out but tell him to ""go potty"". I did not play with him, and if he hadn't done his business within two minutes, he'd be called back inside and get no more attention. 

When I got him, he was 9 months old and about 35 pounds. Now he's a 2 year old, 60-pound pit bull with front paws like diamond-tipped garden rakes, and I'm mighty thankful he doesn't think scratching at the door is the signal for going outside."

mmp31,politics,1391009286.0,"If we didn't have the Fed, the disaster likely wouldn't have happened in the first place.  They pushed interest rates artificially low and held them there too long, which encouraged banks to lend more than they otherwise would have. The Fed also creates a moral hazard that encourages its largest member banks to engage in risky activity. For example, why wouldn't they engage in more risky lending if they know that they will get bailed out if they get into trouble?  So you had the Fed giving its most influential member banks an incentive to make riskier loans, more often.  Truly a recipe for disaster.

I agree the recession would have been worse than it was if we hadn't bailed out the banks, but I don't agree that it would have been a second Great Depression.  The Great Depression was caused by the failure of a fractional reserve monetary standard, because the Fed had to decline the quantity of money by 1/3 over a very short period of time.  If we had a free banking system instead of a fractional reserve standard, the depression never would have happened.

IMO if we had let the banks fail, our economy would be in better shape than it is right now, because we woudn't have shifted all of that wealth from the bottom up to prop up the banks.  We also probably wouldn't have seen 95% of the wealth gains during the recovery go to the 1%. And the market definitely wouldn't have stayed down; the natural ""death-spiral"" is a neo-Keynesian myth.  The market always rebounds if it's allowed the opportunity to do so."

Cal's system relies on a couple of things:

1) On offense, he has to have a point guard that can penetrate and abuse zones (Rose, Evans, Wall) paired with a 2 guard who can exploit the lanes and holes created by said penetration (Chris Douglas-Roberts). This opens the floor up for the 3 other positions, who must also be able to read the lanes/holes that the PG is creating. It was thought the Harrison twins would be great at doing this. They aren't. They have a low basketball IQ and the game seems to baffle them at times.

2) His defense relies on near flawless team cohesion and one lock-down defender on the perimeter (MKG, Antonio Anderson). Doesn't have the lock down defender and it takes time to get a whole team to turn into a cohesive-unit."

Luminous Flush was described as a champagne rose, but I feel that with the product mixed together, it can take on a bit of a coral undertone. Nothing overpowering, but it does have a bit of orange to it.

Diffused Heat was definitely more pink on my skin and it does have a slight bit of visible shimmer. It was described as a vibrant poppy and while it definitely more vibrant than Luminous Flush, it doesn't make me think of a poppy color at all. 

edit: I wanted to add that these are nice blushes. Yes, the $35 price tag is a bit steep, but I don't regret getting them. They have no discernible scent (box says fragrance free), they are soft but not so soft that you're going to break them in an instant, and they deposit color nicely and blend easily.

After you get the number, hit her up a few days later to plan a coffee date or something, and see where it takes you.

teamnewg,WTF,1391010053.0,"Beyond proper ballasting and loading, there isn't really any 'technology' per se that keeps a ship stable.

It's almost entirely down to the design of the vessel. The vessel is kept stable by the righting moment arm created while the ship is rolling, this righting arm is a function of what is known as the metacentric height (or GM), which is the distance from the centre of gravity to the metacentre.

The metacentre can be visualised if you imagine the ship being a weight on a pendulum. The metacentre is the point where the pendulum hangs from (floating in the air above the ship - if you can imagine that)

The BM (distance between centre of buoyancy and metacentre) is a function of the waterplane area of the immersed section of the ship (specifically of the second moment, or inertia moment )

While I'm not going to go into huge detail here, with these details, you can work out the KB (centre of buoyancy) of the vessel, and due to your ships loading, you should have a decent idea of where your KG (centre of gravity) lies. With all this data, you can work out your GM (metacentric height) and thus your righting arm.

I've tried to keep this as simple as possible, but I'm really just trying to stress the point that stability is a result of good ship design, not necessarily anything to do with the company operating the vessel, or any technology on board.

An idiot captain or first mate can still fuck up ballast and loading plans and shift your centre of gravity significantly, but that's really the only factor that can be affected after the ship has been built. (well, there are others such as free surface effects, but those are a little more complicated to explain).

My point being, this ship seems stable. the very fact that it rolled to such a large angle and righted itself means it has an adequate GZ lever (the righting moment arm I referred to earlier) It seems to be favouring a starboard roll, so it's *possible* that the ballasting is off somehow, but that could just as easily be the weather."

I meant classical liberalism.

&gt;The ""invisible hand"" relies on ones self interest as a means of motivation, and will promote and be for the common good. Smith was very much about the individual...

I'm aware.

&gt;Smith opposed monopolies and even large share holder controlled business, believing in a single individual with limited liability would control the business best.

I'm not so hot about that idea.

&gt;But one thing commonly missed or avoided when quoting Smith, is much of his theories are based in morality; meaning people needed to be grounded by a code of morales(think 10 commandments).

Very true, most people aren't even aware The Theory of Moral Sentiments exists.

&gt;So always good to remember that when reading a story or persuasive argument from someone about Smith, if their stance isn't grounded in that or chooses to avoid altogether...most likely it's bullshit.

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1391010336.0,"So here's the idea: some people don't want the responsibility of raising a child. We've reached a point in our society where, thanks to technology, we are not beholden to our biological reactions and can actually deny conception. So, sex has lost a lot of the risk of pregnancy associated with it. That means, people aren't necessarily consenting to being a parent when they have sex these days.

When men say that they want to financially abort a child, it doesn't always mean that they think the woman should abort the child. Men aren't ""forcing"" a woman to abort anymore than anyone else is. Women have several pre- and post-birth options at their disposal. They can terminate the pregnancy, give it up for adoption, apply for welfare, etc. Having the option for a man to financially abort may help push the woman in a specific direction, but it is not forcing her to do anything.

A lot of counter-arguments center on the fact that child support is you know, support for the child. And I fully acknowledge that. Children are a big investment and to raise one adequately it needs a lot of care to sustain all of its needs. A practical problem with this that is often leveled at this point, that could be fixed, is that not all money for child support is going towards the child. If I'm having a good portion of my pay-check taken out every 2 weeks, I would like to know that it is all fully supporting the child - whether that be through rent, utilities, food, clothes for them, etc. I would like the individual to *justify* the expenses.

I've heard some points brought up that if the father doesn't pay, then the state will have to take up the burden. I don't see this as all that valid because, 1) I think the state *should* help care for all individuals, and 2) putting the father into poverty doesn't necessarily fix the situation. Now the father can apply for welfare and once again the state is paying out of pocket to help care for someone.

To justify why I think the state should help provide for children I will bring up this pont: this is all income based withdrawals. If a child needs adequate care and we can reasonably define what that is, why is it that some children we be getting better care due to a parent making more than another one? I don't think it's farfetched to believe that many of the people in this sort of situation aren't financially well off (why else would they petition for something such as this?), and so the money they provide may not be adequate to support the child. Is that OK? Are we alright with having some children with separate parents be worse off than others if we're trying to do what's best for the child?

The last counter-argument I would like to address that people tend to throw around ties into my first point - consenting to sex is consenting to parenthood. Obviously this is not true, otherwise we could not justify having options to avoid pregnancy in the first place. There are certainly *risks* associated with having sex, and people should be clear about what they are willing to take on prior to intercourse, but in no way is a man or woman checking yes for pregnancy the moment a penis enters a vagina.

Now, none of this means that men as a collective are going to start opting out of parenthood and committing to financial abortions. Just like women, some men will pursue it and some won't due to their own personal convictions. But just like abortions or adoption, I think it is good to have the option *available* for those that seriously want it. 

Beyond that, I can conceive of a plethora of practical ways to enforce a route such as this. Practicality isn't the issue here."

When he left me (this is, without telling me and leaving me to realise) I entered a manic episode (borderline personality disorder) and endured hypersexuality. I started working as a call girl.

Because work sex is simply just professional sex and no personal relationship or potential future can come out of it, I don't think anything of it. In fact, I don't even enjoy it. It's more a coping mechanism than anything else.

In my personal life, however, I am ridiculously picky about who I invite into my life. Sometimes I think I'm asexual because I find it difficult to be attracted to the vast majority of guys who seem to be attracted to me. My relationship with sex is based more on need than want."

The cat was surrendered under good terms, and he had some very sweet notes from his previous family. In the notes there were 4 references to adopting this cat with his brother, so I asked where he was. Someone before me saw these sad notes and separated them anyway. Oh hell. Now I'm crying in the middle of PetSmart because I just put my other cat to sleep three weeks ago and now I'm being faced with all these stories of brotherless cat pairings...so yeah, I definitely adopted him that day."

As for your feelings about foundation, I think it can be really intimidating and my early experiences with it were like yours--it seemed uncomfortable and fake. But in my case that was because for years I didn't have a good formula/color for my skin and the look I like (more sheer/dewy) and I didn't know what to do with it. Now that I've experimented a bunch I've found a couple of foundations and a bb cream that make me look just like me--but better--and my skin is in better shape than ever.

I'd definitely encourage you to look into BB and CC creams (really just tinted moisturizer, usually with some SPF). The right formula can only do your skin good and you'll look great. 

Good luck on your make up adventure!"

DoxasticPoo,TheRedPill,1391010750.0,"Again, I completely agree.

It's a hive mind mentality.  People often think of a hive mind mentality as ""group think"".  But it's also ""associative truths"".  

That means if you have a group of people sitting around talking about Topic A, not only will they all agree on Topic A, but since they're similar in other ways they'll likely agree on Topic B.

And thus, often times Topic B ends up being a topic of conversation even if it's not on the agenda.  

It's the hive...!  Personally, I would think TRP would be more about socialism than it is (or at least considerate of it).  One of the largest critiques of capitalism is that it turns EVERY relationship in your life into a marketplace, which is unhealthy for a society.

And what are we seeing today?  People are getting together because they're mental drug addicts looking to up their SMV.  We don't CARE about each other.  We just want to sell for a high value.  Men and women alike.

Cavendish is the one fighter we've seen who was defeated by not being injured, and who therefore has not just the power to take down Trebol in general, but who hasn't used up their strength by now.

Besides, keep in mind that if Law was supposed to have the Heart seat, it's reasonable to assume that the three Executive Officers are roughly at Law's level.  Neither Robin, Usopp, nor Franky will likely be able to take one of them down, and the Monster Trio/Law/Kinemon are all occupied somewhere else.

And that's why ""players standing around"" is actually the most important part of a broadcast, even if it's not addressed as such. I mean, shit, they're not out there spending 35 seconds in between plays with their dicks in their hand. 

It's all one giant mindgame, but that's not what's marketed. People want to see brutes run into each other, but keep in mind that these guys are memorizing 100+ plays, the language for altering each play in several different ways, and then trying to figure out what the guy across from them is going to do, before they do it. 

""Standing around"" is super important, and it's what separates Peyton Manning from the guys who have much greater physical talent. 

EDIT: Since it came up in another comment: What about susbtitutions? Think about it: What other game gives you the ability to dictate what matchups your opponent faces every 40 seconds? Any of 53 players could be lined up on the other side of the ball, and you have to research how each one of them plays.

EDIT2: It would appear that I am wrong, and that hockey also substitutes players at a similar rate. I'll have to check it out next time I'm watching a game.  "

Think about this, when a woman is your friend, is she loyal?  Is she caring?  Is she honest?  Is it emotionally easy?  Is she ""there for you""?  Is she supportive?

In theory, yes.  Because that's what ""friendship"" means for a man.  But it's also what men crave.  It's the ""motherly"" love we all wish woman possessed.  It's the love we give but so rarely receive.

So men get attracted to their female friends quite easily.  Whereas, woman are the opposite.  They're sexually repulsed by their male friends.

This doesn't always happen, of course.  But the ""better friends"" you become with her the more likely you'll like her as ""more than friends"".  And the less likely she'll be interested in you."

GaProgMan,Meditation,1391011315.0,"disclaimer: I'm not a photographer. Also, feel free to replace ""Photoshop"" with ""Image Manipulation Program of your choice"" in the following.

The model on the right is completely washed out compared to the model on the left (notice the full feeling of bold colour in the left-hand image). This could be one of two things:

 * The photographer intentionally flooded the model with too much white light (meaning that fewer colour details would show on the final image)
 * Photoshop was used to brighten the image too much, thereby giving the image a washed out look.

Also, unless the model had lifted her chin vertically then pushed her head toward the camera horizontally (an uncomfortable position to hold for a few minutes, you might agree), then the shadowing under her neck is completely off. This betrays the fact that her head has been raised (using Photoshop), lengthening and softening her neck.

Assuming that the models for both images are not the same person (even if they are, to be fair), if you look at the details on the neck of the left-hand model, you can see the underlying biology of her neck. Compare and contrast that to the image on the right-hand side: her neck is completely smooth, something that is very rarely (if ever) seen in real life - especially if the model was indeed raising her chin then moving her head towards the camera."

CheeseBadger,AdviceAnimals,1391011356.0,"I know the argument I am about to use has been said thousands of times before, but I feel it needs to be stated again.

The car insurance mandate and the health insurance mandate cannot be directly compared. I can't speak for every state, but in my state, people need car insurance *only* if they drive on public roads. For example, let's say you are the single owner of [King Ranch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Ranch), a ranch larger in area than the state of Rhode Island (although it isn't contiguous). If you own a Ford F-150 truck to traverse one of the divisions of the ranch, then you do not need to have car insurance, provided you only travel within the confines of the ranch and not on public roads.

The health insurance mandate differs though. A person is required to have health insurance for the mere fact of existing. There is no escape from it.

For the record, I do not like the Affordable Care Act. I don't even think it was a step in the right direction. I would support a single-payer system, or an insuranceless system of some sort.

coveredinbeeees,Christianity,1391011445.0,"The issues I have with solo scriptura, and to a lesser extent sola scriptura, are that

1. It too often assumes that each verse has a single, easily understood meaning, when this is not often the case. Specifically it gives rise to the idea that the most straightforward reading is the correct one.

1. Simultaneously, it downplays the importance of proper interpretation of scripture and provides a means of legitimizing bad exegesis, because if the Bible is your only authority, who is there to tell you that you have interpreted it incorrectly?

1. Implicit in the affirmation of sola scriptura is the rejection of Holy Tradition in the form of the teachings of the Church throughout history, yet Holy Tradition is what gave us the canon of scripture. Unless you believe that the table of contents of your Bible is inspired, you accept at least one piece of Holy Tradition.

Ultimately, I'm fine with saying that scripture should be our primary authority, but we need tradition to provide a framework for understanding scripture.  If you want an example of how the lack of a framework can lead to misinterpretation, just look at how many times /u/namer98 has to clear up misconceptions about the Jewish law on this sub."

This isn't a good argument. They take on the risk of pregnancy, but women can opt out of that and parenthood. Are you suggesting that because women consent to sex they must now carry the fetus to term since they were implicitly consenting to pregnancy/parenthood?

&gt;This is why after birth, both parents have the same responsbilities to the child

No, they don't, and some are often *denied* the privileges of those responsibilities. Custody can often be very one-sided, and some single parents don't even bother with finding/including the other parent. 

&gt;...(well, I think there are some states that allow mothers to put children up for adoption without finding the father, which should be stopped).

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1391011649.0,"I guess I'll add a few things from my perspective.  
I didn't think that men and women could be friends, but now that I""ve been married a while I think they can.  I'm not saying that your SO has reached that point, but even if he still finds this other girl hot, he may not have any interest in fooling around with her.  

Traveling for a long time can be lonely.  He may have just been enjoying the attention and he knew if he told her about you the attention might stop.  It's not a nice thing to do to someone, but using them for their attention is something that people do.  In fact in my experience it's more often women that will do this to men; lead them on, play hard to get, put them in the friendzone, etc.  

I know you don't want to hear this but it's really on you at this point.  Unless you have solid evidence that he cheated, you need to decide are you ok with his behavior and do you trust him in the future.  
You feel he might have done something wrong.  
He feels that he didn't do anything wrong.  
Unless you had laid down some sort of rules, you are both acting on your personal values, beliefs and experiences.  

Finding another person who either matches our values, has values we can accept, or is willing to meet us in the middle; is why we date people instead of just marrying the first person we meet."

It's not something that originated with NFL games, but general laws about charging admission to display copyrighted material that happens to apply.

&gt;It all sounds boring and academic, but the NFL famously made waves back in 2007 when it went after an Indianapolis church for hosting a Super Bowl party. Fall Creek Baptist Church planned to 1) **charge admission** to cover the food bill **and** 2) show the game on a giant projector system of more than 55 inches. Both were no-nos. In the wake of the NFL's threat, churches around the country canceled get-togethers that year.

I also wouldn't suggest encouraging her to break up with him, but if she is a close friend, maybe you should have a serious talk with her. Tell her how you are conflicted due to her recent ""attention"" she is paying you and that while you return those feelings, you are not one to get involved with a woman already committed to someone else.

Fernis_,gaming,1391011796.0,"It’s more complicated than just saying all devs should allow for monetization of videos and let’s plays. There is a huge difference between mmos, sandbox games and story driven single player games. When you play Minecraft or Rust, you create your adventure, using world and tools given to you by the game, when you play cooperative multiplayer game like Dota 2, Starcraft 2 or Counter-Strike you create entertaining video by showing your skills. Every video from such games will be different and not spoiling anything for future players. But then you play fairy linear game like Walking Dead, Bioshock Infinite or Stanley Parable you just use assets created by the devs. Your input is fairy minimal and by showing the story you are ruining the experience for someone that may decide to buy and play the game.

Where is the line? What is ok and what is not? It’s not for me to say but I’m sure we need some legislations created in cooperation with developers, publishers, streamers, YouTube personalities and most importantly consumers. This will only get more confusing and there will be more examples on both sides (publishers/developera and content creators) of people taking advantage of current status quo.

It doesn't work when you start looking at everything there is no need for her to be doing where there is no shown health risk.

in addition, oral sex is very safe. the enzymes in your saliva will kill the virus, so as long as you don't have cuts or sores in your mouth, you can give him head without worrying. note: don't brush your teeth before you take him in your mouth, as this causes micro-cuts on your gums.

You'd also be taking away all privileges of raising a child. You sign up for financial abortion, and you never to get interact with the child again (unless they perhaps choose to find you as an adult).

&gt;How would you quantify these things?

Tie these in with state laws. If a woman does not have access or has restrictions on abortions, than the same applies for men. Every state would do this on an individual basis.

&gt;That's what I am talking about there.

Sorry, I must've glazed over the part about the father, still working on my coffee.

Something like this I never see in league, you either build the items that guarantee your win, or you will lose horrible (with some minor exceptions).

flyingfisch,AdviceAnimals,1391012383.0,"Let's work on this.

What's your taxable income for the year? You've got a family of four. If I go off of the $9,863.57 and multiply that by 5 according to your comment above, we are looking at $49,317.85. Is that the only income for the household? 

Is this employer coverage? Are you aware that if your employer coverage costs your individual coverage more than 9.5% of your taxable income, it is deemed not affordable by the Affordable Care Act? For a family insurance plan rate, this metric should, but may not hold true. Do you live in a state that has expanded Medicaid such as Illinois? Your kids may be eligible for state coverage under their Children's Health Insurance Program up to 300% of the Federal Poverty Level. 

Even if it is employer coverage you could go onto the Health Insurance Marketplace and receive a tax credit and based on your household size and income given a subsidy to reduce your out of pocket expenses.

[The Kaiser Family Subsidy Calculator isn't perfectly spot on, but it gets you in the ball park of what you could expect to see after completing your application.](http://kff.org/interactive/subsidy-calculator)

The psychologists are saying that ""labeling"" it as a disease changes the behaviors and beliefs of those who are obese and undermines that very treatment.  Most often, treatment isn't a pill or surgery, as with many diseases, but diet and exercise changes.

When obese people think they have a disease, they will act like it is out of their control and there is nothing they can do about it (my words).  If doctors prescribed entire diets and meal plans as treatment and told patients of obesity they will die in 12 weeks if they didn't follow them, maybe people would actually follow them for the time necessary to lose the weight.

But wait.  End the treatment and the disease will return, right?  They will return to their old diet and habits.  After all, bad habits got them obese in the first place.  ""My obesity returned!"" they exclaim. ""I have the obesity disease!  It's not my fault!""

Chase's is a fair one, I just think it's one year too man.  Papelbon's is great, if you are a contending team, but a non-contending team doesn't need an expensive closer so that one hasn't worked out, but it wasn't an awful deal.

etruscan,boardgames,1391012464.0,"I've only patronized Snakes &amp; Lattes, and while I like it, and it seems to be very successful, there are a couple of things I'd change.

One thing to remember is that gamers will make do with a table smaller than you'd expect, but they won't be excited about it. The S&amp;L tables are mostly 3x3 for two people (I think they have some 4x3 tables for groups). We fit what we can on the table and stuff the box and rulebook and junk under the table. If you can get away with bigger tables, go for it, but I know space is always a concern... and at S&amp;L, they have waiting lines for people to get in pretty consistently, so they want MORE tables rather than LARGER tables. That's a decision you need to make.

They run a retail business out of the front of the cafe. It's only a few shelves of games, but it also servers as a ""holding area"" for patrons who want to get a table. This isn't a bad idea, but it can get crowded, so remembering how customers are going to flow through your space is a big deal.

The $5 cover charge doesn't bother me much. I typically buy a few drinks and sandwiches and perhaps even a game - so that $5 disappears into the bigger bill quite quickly.

dremic,AskReddit,1391012515.0,"It has been a year and four months since my wife died. I will check out the Journal of Souls, I haven't heard of it yet. 

I will tell you that shortly after I do believe that my wife was with me for a certain time. 

Before she died her mothers dog had a litter and we had decided to keep one of the puppies. Within the last couple days of her life she said to me, are you going to keep the dog? I asked her if she wanted me to and she said yes. So I did.

About two weeks or so after she died I was in the backyard at my parents house taking her out so she could go to the restroom and I saw her digging in the back corner. She was at it for a few minutes and she came running back to me. She had in her mouth the wristband that belonged to my wife from the hospital. She brought it right to me. While this story to some might seem like a coincidence I choose to believe my wife was saying, I am here and I am with you. Ever since then I believe I will see her again.

They say time heals all wounds, but I think thats bullshit. The truth is when I see a picture of my wife I feel angry and sad. I'm sure this period will pass...but right now I just don't think about it. Everybody grieves differently though."

It's also my experience that religious groups that aren't okay with gay people are even less okay with trans people. You can generally look at a position statement or ""statement of faith"" on a church's or a denomination's website and see what they think about gay people. While they rarely bother to talk about trans people, if they don't like gay people, they probably won't like trans people either."

tangerinelion,AdviceAnimals,1391012585.0,"&gt; generally refer to people who don't work by choice

It seems the default argument from anyone who is opposed to social safety nets has this sentiment.  If you don't want to work, we don't want to support you.

First, the number of people who voluntarily choose to not work and instead try to collect social benefits is relatively small.  Back when reddit was all about UBIs we generally understood that some people would choose not to work.  Side effect of this is the number of workers goes down, meaning wages go up.  If you really force these people to work you either increase the number of unskilled and therefore minimum-wage workers (which we already know need public assistance) or you increase the number of homeless.

Now, I'm not sure what you think happens when some measurable portion of your neighborhood becomes homeless but the idea that you have more money by not supporting them isn't the idea that comes to mind.  Homeless decrease property values, and some may opt to commit robberies, theft, etc.  So now you've got a homeless problem and a crime problem, but don't worry because you're paying about $25 less in taxes.  Ignore the fact that your home's value sank several thousand, the key part is that your tax bill is inconsequentially smaller."

incogito_ergo,financialindependence,1391012590.0,"IMO you have to look at ROI.  Can you get a better ROI from RE than stocks?  For the most part ESPPs provide much better returns than any other investment (most people don't understand the math and think that e.g. 15% discount = 15% return every 6 months, when in fact 15% discount = 17.6% return... dramatic difference.  Guaranteed &gt;35% annualized return? Don't mind if I do.).

When making less money, I generally eschewed the 401(k) (my company match sucks, would contribute to max with 50 or 100% max for sure) and went straight to RE.  Now the tax benefits of maxing 401(k) make it worthwhile, despite likely poorer returns, so I max ESPP, 401(k), HSA, and everything else will go into RE, barring a major correction in the stock market.

In the end though, this is all driven by ROI.  If PE10 was at 5, and earnings at a historic low (opposite of today's circumstances), I would be all in on the stock market.

This will change when I near retirement though.  Trying to get a stable 10% yield from equities is damn near impossible, while in RE it is de rigueur.  I intend to have basic living expenses covered by a diversified RE portfolio (mixed SFH and multi-family), and most of the remainder of my net worth in dividend aristocrats.

Just one man's opinion.  Hope it's helpful to you."

Russia: Eventually became an empire, but not until EUIV time. Still, this is one example showing the creation of a new empire is still possible.

Francia: essentially another possible interpretation for a reborn empire of Charlemagne

Scandinavia: one could argue that this title most accurately depicts the role and power held by Canute the Great at the height of his power

I guess when a country gets big and powerful enough, They tend to start calling themselves by pretentious titles, and formable empires reflect that.

urfouy,offmychest,1391012798.0,"OP, I have struggled with binge eating for a little over a year now.  Here's what I can tell you:

* Read [Intuitive Eating](http://www.intuitiveeating.com/).  This is a book that's handed out at a lot of eating disorder clinics, and it can be really helpful for you.  In my case, it was the catalyst that helped me to slowly crawl away from binging and obsessing.  It's basically a set of guidelines on how to silence the negative voices in your head and eat like a normal person.

* Eat what you want, when you feel like eating it. You're right, healthy food isn't always low calorie--and nor is junk food always the enemy.  I don't let myself read the nutritional information on things I eat anymore.  It doesn't matter.  What matters is that I feel full and happy about eating.  What I've noticed, after months and months of actively working to silence my stupid inner monologue, is that I naturally regulate myself.  

* I thought that if I listened to my cravings, I would gain weight.  It turns out that it's the opposite.  You might start out by eating a ton of licorice or grabbing a huge sandwich every day--but once your body realizes that it's not going to be restricted, this will all start to come out in the wash.  For instance, if I eat an embarrassing amount of bread for lunch, I might want salad with grilled chicken for dinner.  Or maybe it won't balance out until a few days later when I am inexplicably not hungry for lunch.  Or maybe it will never balance out at all and I will have eaten a few hundred extra calories.  If I'm not obsessing over it, *it doesn't matter*.  

* What makes you miserable is the disordered eating behavior, and if you can start to combat it, you will feel better and you probably find yourself at the size you want without dieting.  It's like magic.

* Yes, it can be over.  I am six months out since I first read Intuitive Eating, and I'm not totally done with my eating disorder.  However, I'm *so much better* than I was before.  By not counting calories and consciously suppressing the part of me that said ""Eat less,"" or ""Don't eat that,"" I've lost weight.  I've hired a therapist for the final push, and she has been really damn helpful.  Best of all, I've started to feel good about myself even if I ate a burger and fries for lunch. 

Edit:  I know that you said you don't binge anymore and that you're not actually purging, so I wanted to compliment you on a jojb well done.  It might feel like you're taking a step backward when you start intuitively eating, but my therapist has assured me that it's part of the process.  Like you, I just don't want to obsess about eating anymore.  "

I was corrected:  ""No, **we look down on innovation, we copy the best**, we were beaten by the Americans so we copied the Americans.""  

For me, that's been an interesting way of looking at how change is approached in Japan, and why the society is sometimes surprisingly open to radical change and sometimes utterly hidebound.

EDIT 2: I still can't find it and it's driving me crazy, but I'm at work and should probably be doing other things right now. All i know is that another topic touched upon in the interview was that people only hear what they want to hear, and that when he interrupted T-Swift to say Beyonce has the better video it was just to speak his mind, and that nobody paid attention when he said that he thought Coldplay had a better video than he himself did, and that they deserved an award more than he did.

Borror0,Quebec,1391012913.0,"[Tyler Cowen a formulé un excellent argumentaire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDxcURE7sJs#t=3m05s) dans lequel il défend que Paul Krugman est le Milton Friedman de nos jours, malgré le fait que Krugman est de gauche alors que Friedman était de droite. Selon lui, les débats du temps (communisme, taux d'échange flottant, privatisation, etc.) étaient sur des issues perçues comme étant de droite alors que, de nos jours, ce sont des issues perçues comme étant de gauche qui domine les débats aux États-Unis (système de santé, changement climatique, inégalité, etc.). Bref, l'économiste avec une forte audience populaire va varié en fonction des débats populaires de l'époque.

Dans la même lignée, l'économiste Scott Sumner (de droite) a écrit un blogue à propos de Matt Yglesias (de gauche) nommé, [*What if Matt Yglesias had been born in 1955?*](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=13608) Selon Sumner, il s'aligne avec la droite puisque, dans son temps, la droite avec un discours beaucoup plus rationnel alors que, de nos jours, c,est la gauche américaine qui a le discours le plus sensé et donc, pour cette raison, Yglesias s'aligne avec la gauche. Bref, on voit les intellectuels se ranger d'un côté du débat et prendre plus de place parce que ce côté a les meilleurs solutions aux préoccupation du temps.  

Au Québec, nos préoccupations modernes sont plus de droite que de gauche. Le facteur limitant, dans tous les débat, est l'argent. Le contribuable québécois n'a tout simplement assez confiance en l'État pour justifier une expansion de celui-ci ainsi que plus d'impôt. Le discours de droite critiquant l'État résonne plus avec leur expérience personnelle. 

Pour la gauche, ceci est très limitant. Si celle-ci veut se déplacer vers le modèle nordique, elle a besoin de l'appui de la population et celui-ci est conditionnel à un État mieux géré. Donc, même pour la gauche, les préoccupations premières sont celles d'efficiences : comment diminuer les dépenses de l'État sans affecter les services, quels programmes valent la peine d'être coupés afin de réinvestir les fonds ailleurs, comment encourager la croissance économique et la productivité pour augmenter les revenus de l'État, etc. On vit dans une époque plus de droite que celle d'auparavant. Il est donc normale qu'on entend le discours de droite plus souvent qu'avant. Ce n'est peut-être qu'une étape nécessaire vers une expansion de l'État ou c'est peut-être un changement de valeur, de direction. Mais, peu importe, c'est la réalité actuelle.

As horrible of a disease as cancer is, you may take some consolation in knowing that it is one of the most treatable forms. I hope that you have a quick road to recovery. 

With that said, in order to prevent an overblown reaction from your average gainer, I'd like to respond to your two observations:

1) You should absolutely have regular check-ups. It also can't hurt to be checked if you suddenly gain/lose weight or have a sudden increase/decrease in appetite. 

However, keep irrational thought in check when starting to gain. If you are doing all the right things to gain weight -- and you are gaining weight -- don't assume the worst if you jump up a couple of pounds. This may seem obvious, but many users have worried about sudden weight gain. 

Also note that many gainers experience an initial large jump (5-15 lbs.) during the first two weeks due to increased water weight and glycogen stores.

2) Keep in mind that you are the (unfortunate) exception, not the rule. Evidence shows that **in the absence of a medical issue,** your metabolism only differs from the average by ~200 calories.

teH_wuT,relationships,1391013036.0,"The issue I've found with being too emotionally invested in a girl is that a lot of girls will take advantage of that. Sure, I may be making a generalization but this is from my experience. You're making yourself a doormat for this girl and it's not like you are ending this friendship because she won't have sex with you - this would be irrational and unfair. You're seriously setting yourself up to be hurt more and she knows she can fall back on you in the future. 

As for what to do, I really don't know. I would say keep your distance and become busy with other things and just try and move on. It seems like you bend over backwards for these girls and the unfortunate reality is that nobody is obligated to reciprocate that. I know a lot of people will jump to the ""tell her how you feel"" approach, but I feel that is just going to put salt on the wound because it already seems like you know how she feels. 

This girl will know what she lost once you're gone and I don't think it's worth having a relationship with her since she pulled this stunt. My ex slept around while telling me she wanted to get back together and I ended up more hurt in the end since I let her control the situation on HER terms.

TioTaba,truegaming,1391013149.0,"When I was younger I used to play a lot more, since I had more free time to do that.

I remember playing FFVII for more than 12 hours straight once, and I also remember one time I played FFVIII for so long in the same position I got a backache for almost 2 weeks. Now I'm 31 and I didn't buy any console or a new gaming PC for the last 5 years because I'm saving money to get married.

But...!

Obviously, I own a notebook, and it's ok for some games like Diablo III, League of Legends and World of Warcraft.

I play online games/MMORPGs since my early twenties. I started with Ragnarok Online, and I dedicated A LOT of my time to that game. As for tolls I paid to play IT, I never went out with friends (and even my girlfirend at the time) on War of Emperium days (for those unfamiliar, this is a PvP event between clans to get hold of castles) because I was in charge of an attack squad on my guild. So I ditched friends a lot at that time.

Later I transitioned to World of Warcraft. I started with a casual mentality, because I'm in love with the lore of the game and I really like everything Blizzard releases. Of course, that didn't go as planned, and suddenly I realized how much time I was spending playing this game. I got to the point where I went to bed around 03:00am and woke up at 08:00am to play some more before I went to work. That went on and on for almost 4 years.

But yeah, I can't seem to stay away from online games, so my current obssession is League of Legends. When I started playing this game I used to play at least 3 matchs per night. Since a match goes around 40~50 min, I went to bed really late. Besides, I've spent A LOT of money buying champions and skins (I'm not very patient for grinding points to unlock the champions for free). Also, League took a toll on my head. Since the community in general is so toxic, it wasn't unusual for me to go to bed sad and depressed after a few matches, and sometimes those feelings lasted for a few days. Currently, I'm playing very moderately after taking a break, and I'm muting everyone ingame so I won't stress out with flamming.

As for when I get married, I plan to buy all the consoles I don't have. I'm very behind on releases, so I'll have a lot of games to play. But  since I'll have a bit more of free time (less weekend dates with the fiancée) I know I'll be able to find some time to play the games. But I don't think I'll ever play through 12 hours straight again, since I'll have to take care of the house and give attention to my wife.

All that stuff, specially online gaming (but not excluding consoles or handhelds, because I also spent whole nights playing Phoenix Wright on my DS) really affected my sleeping schedule, and I have trouble sleeping since I was a kid, so everything just got more and more aggravated. As for social problems go (ie. friends and girlfriend), that never really affected me. I still keep in touch with good friends and I don't put playing games over my fiancée either, so everything is fine.

As for advice, I believe that every excess is bad for you. So even if you REALLY enjoy playing games, try to do it moderately. What helps me is to set some time apart from my day to do that. Like, do all the stuff that you have to do, and set about 2 hours per day or something to play games. Don't cross that time frame, but don't skip it either. That might help you detox too. But if you're prone to addiction, I'd stay away from online games until you are sure you can deal with them."

If you don't want to talk about something personal -- don't ever bring up said personal topic and if it does arise, make clear that you will not discuss it and suggest discussing something else.  If the other people persist, continue to not discuss said topic and remove yourself from the conversation if needed.

mdkss12,news,1391013213.0,"&gt; studies show lack of a father figure equates to lower future income

for that i would argue its correlation not causation as a large number of fatherless kids are from low income areas. studies also say that children growing up in houses where parents stay together 'for the kids' actually end up having higher cortisol levels (indicative of higher stress) and lower reported happiness (edit: than those whose parents are separated).

if they are solely giving money then they still aren't there as a father figure anyway. 

that leaves him being present part time as an option. i'm theoretically fine with this option, but that would require the father to house and feed the child for certain lengths of time and should only be required to pay support if that time is significantly less than the mother

but i'd still point to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1wg74s/man_sentenced_to_prison_for_tricking_woman_into/cf1stza) and [this article](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=2) specifically these 2 bits:

&gt;Coercing legal paternity in such cases leads to painful “disestablishment” battles that are unlikely to be in the best interest of the child or promote stable family relationships. 

and

&gt;However, just as court-ordered child support does not make sense when a woman goes to a sperm bank and obtains sperm from a donor who has not agreed to father the resulting child, it does not make sense when a woman is impregnated (accidentally or possibly by her choice) from sex with a partner who has not agreed to father a child with her. In consenting to sex, neither a man nor a woman gives consent to become a parent, just as in consenting to any activity, one does not consent to yield to all the accidental outcomes that might flow from that activity."

Some guys, especially online, classify that as ""overweight"" even if the person is medically within a healthy BMI and body fat percentage, so if you're going by the internet hardbody scale, then maybe I do prefer ""overweight"" women.

I am in the ""normal"" BMI and BF% range myself, and exercise regularly to maintain health and stamina, rather than any aesthetic reasons. I do have a bit of a belly, but it's only really noticeable when I am sitting down with my shirt off.

It wouldn't be ok for me to make the choice to possibly have a child that the father doesn't consent to.

Partner who does not want children wants to get a vasectomy, so I think after that point and the testing that follows it, we'd assume if I got miracle pregnant it would be by partner who does want them, I would have the baby, and we'd act accordingly."

The fact that it's mocking a die-hard feyenoord supporter (our red is redder than your 'red' marck) is fine, it's just that he died of cancer that makes it a bad banner. It's completely unnecessary, but it's not mocking cancer as I've read in quite a lot of places.

'Bommen op Rotterdam' while referring to WW2, is also just part of any rivalry. I don't mind the chants, I don't like the images of it, that obviously refer to the WW2 bombings though, but just singing about destroying x rival city isn't too bad imo.

And no, I don't think of 'and who doesn't jump is a jew' as anti-semitic (as  someone with Jewish heritage), or any other songs that just refer to us as jews. 
It's only when they involve things like Hamas, or gas, that it crosses that line. Personally I think the whole 'kick the jews ,stab the jews, kill the jews' chants are a bit too far, but the whole controversy about 'we're going to hunt the jews' was a bit overblown. It's obviously metaphorical in most cases. We just need to worry about how it influences the young people in those cities with regards to their opinions about actual jews. I've heard kids from those areas use 'dirty jew' etc. as common insults, which is a bit disturbing."

nevertruly,AskWomen,1391013806.0,"&gt;you go any any forum and some guy asks does ____ matter? A lot of the members will say ""not as much as being a good person etc."" which I can believe but it still matters doesn't it? 

Because what *part* of looks matter and the *extent* of how much it matters is very individual. Some people care a lot about muscles. Personally, I am not into the muscle-look, so if someone asks, I will tell them it doesn't matter to me. Some people love long hair on guys. Personally, I am not into long hair on guys, so if someone asks, I will tell them it doesn't matter to me, but it isn't my preference. Some people love facial tattoos. Personally, I hate them, so I would weigh in that I don't like that as an aspect of someone's appearance. Some people care a lot about height. I am mostly indifferent to it as long as it is within 6 inches taller or shorter than me, so I would say that it didn't really matter to me outside of that range. 

Saying that 'x' trait being asked about doesn't matter to me doesn't mean that I don't care about appearance at all, it just means that I don't care about those things. Every woman has a different set of which things matter/don't matter appearance-wise for attraction, so you won't get a consistent answer as to what people like or dislike because there isn't a hivemind that decides for everyone."

GympieGympie,everymanshouldknow,1391014011.0,"How to truly make scrambled eggs that don't take forever?

Scramble and cook at the same time.  Here's what I do:

Put frying pan or whatever on low/medium heat.  Throw in butter.  When the butter melts at a fairly fast rate, throw in your eggs.  Just crack them all in.  Then, stir and cook.  When they hit the consistency you want (some people like runny, some people like dry), you're done.  

Note, this makes eggs that are white and yellow.  Most people think of scrambled eggs as one color where the egg whites and yolks are blended before cooking.  This doesn't quite blend them all the way together, plus the whites cook faster than the yolks anyway.  So if that offends you for whatever reason, don't do it.  These are the kind of eggs I grew up with and still make today, they taste great, and are the fastest way I know when it comes to preparing eggs.  "
poryphria,kpop,1391014012.0,"Bear with me, this is a long, long post.

I think K-Pop hasn't evolved as a music form as much as we'd like to think.  What really has changed is social media and how in tune Korean society is with media technology.  When I really started getting into K-Pop in 2007, it was harder to find accurate information in English about idols/singers I was interested in, and new sites like Allkpop were basically reasons to bash idols and make fun of them, rather than presenting any sort of objectivity (then again, it's not much better today- but look up what they wrote in 2008/09).  When I started listening to BoA and Lee Jung Hyun around late 2003, I had to have friends translate stuff for me, and it was mainly from a Japanese perspective.  Without the entertainment companies' responses to the growth of social media, the Hallyu Wave would have been a fraction of what it was.

Back to the actual music; people like to talk about the good old days and reminisce on ""how much better music was and now they're making crap""...and for most things, it's just nostalgia filter.  Even with K-Pop, I think it's partly nostalgia filter...but they do have a point.  There just wasn't as many idols out there pumping out lackluster songs every few months.  The mini album as a type of release became popular primarily because of Big Bang; before them, albums once a year or every few years were the way to go- along with singles.  Things moved slower.  

In 2012, there were more than 100 musical act debuts, 35-40 of them female groups. Compare that to 2008, where the only female group debut was Davichi.  Too much saturation can be a good or bad thing.  Good: There have been some amazing songs and albums put out in the last few years.  Bad:  There have been a shitton of awful songs and albums put out in the last few years, from companies who just want to make a quick buck without putting any effort into it.  

Also, K-Pop visually is stuck in the early-mid 2000s.  There may be better cameras and clothes (debatable, actually), but compare videos from most girl groups to groups like TLC, Destiny's Child, Boyz II Men, NYSNC, Backstreet Boys, Girls Aloud, and Spice Girls.  They borrow a lot from them, in setting and song structure and marketing...and while I can see it as a positive, since I like all those aforementioned groups- it's not going to cut it past 2013.  There needs to be an evolution in aesthetics if they want to become global.  Take Gangnam Style for instance- that MV screams ""viral video"", and it's inventive, makes fun of itself, and doesn't have any trace of the ""idol-stare"" used seriously (Hyuna parodied it fantastically IMO).  Looking back on the phenomenon, no wonder it was the MV to break into the west.  It was modern.  Maybe it's a continental thing, since I see so much of the same in Japanese music, but I think Japanese pop music has regressed rather than stagnated.  But that's a story for another topic.

Korean society's outlook on work and visual perfection needs to change.  I thought it was bad in Hollywood (and it's *bad*), but the entertainment industry in that country takes it up to 11.  Pretty people are nice to look at, but the absolute obsession on the perfect Korean face has bothered me for years.  I thought there were a fair number of US pop singers who weren't great singers...but Korean pop music is filled with them.  Of course, you can say that idols need to be a jack-of-all trades in order to succeed (and I mostly agree), but when you see group after group with superfluous members, I start thinking that the US model of specializing in one or two facets of entertainment is less stressful and less harmful on growing bodies.  This is why I also can't stand the Disney Channel anymore.  I know just *looking* at idols when I was a teenager made me feel insecure about my body, and I was 110 pounds soaking wet.  I can't imagine what it must be like for actual Korean teenagers.  

I don't know where K-Pop is headed- January was sexy month and maybe February will be different, I don't know.  Right now I'm worried about the physical and emotional effects that this sort of life can have on children and young adults.  You see what the entertainment industry does to kids in the US, and in a country where mental health is even more nonexistent, I fear the worst.  

Looking back on my post, I can sort of see why Sam and Eunji wanted to leave Nine Muses.  Very hard work for very little (if any) payoff.

VoxMeretricis,AskWomen,1391014103.0,"I actually don't think the dichotomy of  traditional/progressive is super useful, but particularly so for this question. I mean, what traditional femininity are you actually referring to here? What you're referring to really isn't about gender at all, I think - it's about power relations in a relationship. What I wonder, however, is why you have such an uncompromising view of them.

&gt;I know I would be angry if my SO tried to lead me!
&gt;I would be pissed off if I felt like I was the one being protected or led in the relationship

That... honestly seems a little odd to me. In my opinion, relationships are a natural flow, a give-and-take, and involve a great deal of compromise by both partners. It has nothing to do with gender, but I accept that there will be some situations in my life where my boyfriend (hopefully someday husband) will lead me, and there will be some where he will protect me. Not because he's the man, but because we're both human. I will not always *be* right, and I will not always *have* the right to lead our relationship any more than he will. Why would this be something to be angered by? 

I would feel very uncomfortable in a relationship that I was always leading and always protecting. That would drastically limit the amount that my SO would be capable of participating in the relationship, and it would place an enormous amount of responsibility and work on my shoulders that I, frankly, don't want to accept.

Leading and following, protecting and being protected - isn't it time we stopped attaching masculine/feminine labels to those things? By reinforcing each action with a particular gender, you're just perpetuating the idea that ""protecting"" is something men do, not women. In fact, being protected and led by a male SO does not mean I am taking a ""traditional"" feminine role, it means that in this situation, he knows better. When I protect him and lead him, it doesn't mean I'm taking on ""masculine"" traits, it means that in that situation, I know better. To me, it's not really about gender, it's about what is appropriate for the our relationship in a given situational context. "

It takes significant effort, in terms of both time and energy, to learn this on your own, because *no one teaches it to you unless they're trying to sell you something*.

If you learn it in college, they're selling you an education (honestly, probably the best way to learn this stuff). If you learn it from a financial advisor, it's because they're trying to gain you as a client (and most people will have a hard time trusting that form of information). If you learn it on your own, you suffer the fear of making mistakes (as all novices do), except these mistakes could mean you lose your savings, which is very discouraging. So risk-averse people/non-autodidactics tend to just do whatever is safest/easiest, which is start a savings account with their bank."

Some things barely seem to make sense. The game is going to be ultra-realistic, but involve unexplained interstellar travel? It's an educational celebration of space travel, but a RTS game? Or is it a RTS? The description doesn't seem to be too clear. It seems like it wants to be a real-time 4X/RTS hybrid like Sins of a Solar Empire, and a dogfighting/RTS hybrid like Allegiance.

This all makes it possibly the most ambitious game ever. Star Citizen and Elite: Dangerous are ambitious too, but at least there's the backing of two people with proven track records (Chris Roberts and David  Braben) behind these projects; people who *have* done this before and know what is and isn't possible. There's no info of the previous achievements behind the programmers who are doing these games. There's little info about how involved all these cosmonauts are. Why have so many cosmonauts on the team in the first place? If they were doing a simulation of current space development it would make sense, or even perhaps a simulation akin to Kerbal Space Program, but if it's only about getting the physics right for a 4X game, that shouldn't require so many cosmonauts.

In all, it really seems to me like this is either a scam, or doomed to fail like Clang did. They threw everything *and* the kitchen sink into the game ""design"", and have not demonstrated they have the technical means to create any game, *let alone* this monstrosity of a challenge."

I didn't hear anything from the GIC, but I assumed it was just from waiting periods. In late November I went to my GP for an unrelated issue and asked about my referral.

If this hadn't happened in my home and I hadn't seen what cats are capable of I would be of the same opinion as you.  I am not a person who just gives up an animal because it becomes inconvenient.  This is not the first time that this cat has shown this type of aggression.  I have spoken to several vets, the SPCA, and done a lot of research on the subject of redirected aggression and the only way to avoid this is to eliminate the source causing the aggression, ie keep other animals off of your property so that cat can not see them out of the window. This is not possible, we live in an apartment complex.  We have worked with this cat on 3 other occasions extensively to calm her and take the correct steps to reintroduce her to our other cat and restore harmony in our home, this has sometimes take weeks.  It has been a lot of work. 

Have you ever been in a home where this has happened? Or around when this has happened?  Every time it happens either me or my husband end up bloody and on one occasion requiring stitches.  Believe me this is heartbreaking for me and a complete last resort.  The aggressor cat will chase the other cat around the house at high speed with an extreme amount of clawing. Every time I have been run over while in my bed, the cats once took this trip over my husband face before he had time to wake up properly.  Every time this has occurred it has happened between 4am and 5:30am.  I have a cosleeper, if this happens when the baby is here, there is a very good chance that the cats will have their little chase scene right over the baby.  Unfortunately that is not something I am willing to take a risk on.  I keep thinking of those large rear claws that can rip through a comforter right into my skin, going over my childs face, taking out eyes and causing permanent scarring, extensive stitched or plastic surgery.  Or that happening to my 7 year old. This is a dangerous animal and unfortunately I no longer feel safe with her here. "

Dude?! I just woke up and SAW this reply and it's already been at 4/4. Aint nobody downvoting you. Chill the fuck out.  &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232; 

For real. You MIGHT have lept before you looked. Also, I'm pretty sure people are downvoting you because you're being condescending and basically treating everybody here like they're stupid/oh-so-sensitive for having an issue with Macklemore. I guess because you're a fan or something.

&gt;TL;DR: it wasn't white supremacy that got him a Grammy or success and I think a lot of you are confusing your own distaste for him for racism. 

And I think you're misrepresenting me on a grotesque level along with doing an awful lot of 'Splaining. I know how the Grammy's work.

Fact is, I don't care how Macklemore got there or why. And it's not JUST that he's white, it's that he's a full on cultural appropriator who's not only using Black culture to get Mama a new fur coat, but he's treating the entire LGBT community like useful idiots.

I'm a Brother Ali fan, so, yeahno. There IS a way to do it right. Macklemore is not that person. He's a rapping hipster who's moving into the musical equivalent of Harlem and jacking the rent up so people who's been there all their lives can no longer afford it. And he brought Robin Thicke and Ryan Lewis with him."

____________________________________

**Violent Crime.** [FBI database for violent crime 2004](http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius_04/offenses_reported/violent_crime/index.html)

&gt;In 2004, there were an estimated **1,367,009 violent crimes** nationwide. Of these, aggravated assaults comprised 62.5 percent; robbery, 29.4 percent; forcible rape, 6.9 percent; and murder, 1.2 percent. (Based on Table 1.)

*That's a rate of 465.5 per 100 000 people per year, only counting reported crimes.*

_________________________________________

**Shark attacks.** [Oceana shark attack statistics USA 2006-2010](http://oceana.org/en/our-work/protect-marine-wildlife/sharks/learn-act/shark-attack-statistics)

&gt;Considering that more than 200 million people visit U.S. beaches each year, the number of shark attacks is relatively small. Of those millions of beach goers each year, about **36 are attacked by sharks**

*That's a rate of 0.012 per 100 000 people per year, again only counting reported attacks.*

____________________________________

**Lighting strikes.** [NOAA lightning strike statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike#Human_injury) through wikipedia, to avoid linking to PDF. The source is in the References section.

&gt;over the last 20 years, the United States averaged **51 annual lightning strike fatalities**, ...In the US, between 9% and 10% of those struck die [**thus about 500 strikes per year**],[6] for an average of 40 to 50 deaths per year (28 in 2008).[7] The chance of an average person living in the US being struck by lightning in a given year is estimated at 1/500,000

*That's a rate of 0.2 per 100 000 people per year, again only counting reported strikes.*

________________________________

In contrast, let's compare to something of a comparable probability:

**Motor vehicle accidents**. [US Census Bureau MVA statistics  1990-2009](http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/transportation/motor_vehicle_accidents_and_fatalities.html)

&gt;2009 **Motor vehicle accidents 10 800 000**

*That's a rate of 3600 per 100 000 people per year, again only counting reported accidents.*

________________________________

The probability of a violent crime is on about the same order of magnitude as that of a car accident. This is without considering non-violent property crimes.

PollenOnTheBreeze,malefashion,1391014380.0,"Honestly, the quality is insane. Every little thing about the bag is very well thought out and insanely sturdy. Construction and materials are top notch. 

I bought the IISE tech bag a while back as kinda an alternative, but it malfunctioned and I sent it back but the quality on that bag and the 20L is not even comparable. Without a doubt this is my end game bag. Not only does it blow IISE out of the water but I think it's nicer than the ACR bag I had a while ago too. Granted the sever different roles and purposes, but they are still in the same relative price area.

So far I'm very happy with the purchase. My only personal issue I would've liked better is that I would've preferred that the side pockets on the exterior would be deeper, but that's really not a big deal. 

It should be noted that I didn't pay retail, tho the bag was brand new. With retail just under $700, I, in my own opinion, would say that if I would've payed $700 for it, I would still be extremely happy with my purchase.

My back pack goes everywhere with me so I'm perfectly happy shelling out for something quality that makes my life easier. "

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1391014430.0,"And this is the one problem I am hinged on. I understand that women have a huge emotional burden to carry in the case of an abortion or giving up the child. And I don't have a good retort for it completely. I think that we as a society should be willing to put into more for child support across the board and apply it those in need. Maybe someday we will.

The interesting thing though, is that those are the only three options regardless of whether or not the man is paying child support, and in some instances the man isn't going to pay regardless. I don't believe that a man choosing not to pay will have a strong force on the decision of a woman in regards to her unborn child - plenty of women choose to abort or give up the child regardless if the father is willing to support it financially.

As I've said before, I don't think all men are going to be pursuing this course of action across the board. Not all men are heartless deadbeats. Plenty of men *want* to be fathers or decide to take on the responsibility once they realize it is a very real possibility. But like women, I think the option should be *available* should one want to pursue it.

Maybe not given yet in the current legal climate, but I think it's something we should consider for the future."

I have zero interest in having sex with any ex, and I never feel like they are contacting me for that.

Selsen,sweden,1391014577.0,"Jag menar att det som är självklart för oss inte är självklart för andra. Vad jag försöker få fram är att vissa saker tar man för givet eftersom man blivit så van vid det, och det finns inte i ens tankar att ifrågasätta det förrän efteråt.

Om jag ändrar mitt exempel till att det står på biljetten att ""övriga tjänster kostar extra"" på flygbiljetten, så skulle jag uppfatta det som att mat och filmvisning inte ingår i priset. Att ta reda på hur mycket det skulle kosta att gå på toa skulle inte vara något jag ens tänkt på att ta reda på innan. Överdrivet exempel igen, men jag hoppas du förstår vad jag menar!

Jag har aldrig varit utanför Europa, och är långt ifrån berest, men vid ett tillfälle när jag var på genomresa i Tyskland befann jag mig plötsligt i akut behov av diverse kvinnliga hygienartiklar. Jag såg Lidl (som jag naturligtvis visste var tyskt, men antog var hyfsat internationellt inriktat eftersom de har butiker även i Sverige) och det föll det mig aldrig in att de skulle vägra mitt Visa-kort.

Vissa saker tänker man inte på, det sker oförberedda saker när man är i en främmande miljö, men om landet ska vinna något på turismen så måste folk vara inställda på att ge ut den information som behövs för att gästerna ska komma tillbaka.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391014605.0,"&gt; That's not true. Most people want to use Windows, but those that don't can still use Linux or Mac OS.

Why should law be a monopoly?

And how does playing Battlefield 4 work out for running stuff on OSX or Linux, for instance? Oh wait, the decision for most people to flock to windows have made it where gaming companies (except for maybe valve as of late) dont bother catering to such users because it's not worth the effort. 

If everyone were able to practice the law they wanted, then everyone would become a law unto itself, and you'd have chaos, that's why.

&gt;For most societies throughout most of human history, there wasn't anything resembling a government, much less a nation state.

As thomas hobbes put it, life in such situations was ""nasty, brutish, and short"".

The physical body has, for the lack of a better scientific term, a karmic body. The karmic body is sort of like reddit's karma. You get upvotes and downvotes for stuff you do, think, want to do, etc. You are born with a pre-allocated bag of karma (probably what Christianity refers to as the original sin) and the goal of a human life is to burn that bag of karmas to zero. IF you do that, you are liberated. If you don't you take what's left and start over again in another life.

the thing is as you live your life, you develop (by combination of your original karma+your actions in the current life) a set of tendencies. Now, if these tendencies are allowed to burn off during your lifetime (you die of old age/natural causes after a ripe life) your remaining karma is little, and your ""soul"" will be reborn with a smaller bag next life. And if you do the ""right"" things that time around, your chances of gaining liberation will be easier in your next life.

However, if you were to be murdered or if you die unnaturally (and earlier on) those tendencies are still vibrant in your soul. And that means your soul will naturally tend to find a body to burn them off. For example, if you had thoughts of sex and wanted to fulfill it to the best you could in your life, and instead you die earlier, you'll probably be born as a pig (pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes). Or some such thing. You need not be born as a human again, but the tendencies will pick the obvious body to burn off that bag of karma."

Don't expect her to contact you because you're thoroughly friend-zoned, and there's no chance in hell of being absolutely anything with her other than her friend and emotional whore.

Of course things will get better. Time will make it better and you'll eventually find you no longer care for her, and place your interest elsewhere. And once you do, spare yourself of wasting your time and money and feeling miserable for years, and ask her out on the spot. If she's up for it, fine.

tangerinelion,boston,1391014699.0,"That entire system is a complete failure.  We do the same thing with our roads and then everyone just bitches about how the road takes forever to finish.  Even once they're done the pavement starts coming up as soon as we salt them for the first snow so now people bitch about potholes.  This is because the low-bidder will pave with bare-minimum coverage, maybe half an inch of asphalt.  Other countries use up to a foot on major high-speed roadways and their roads last for years and years.

Of course if you remove the low-bidder contract jobs and instead award contracts based on some other method you have a huge opportunity for corruption (nepotism, or awarding jobs to companies that politicians or donors have a huge stake in).  

In this case it's quite clear that Hyundai failed to deliver based on their contract.  In normal situations that is a breach of contract.  As a first idea of how to better award contracts it should go to the low-bidder provided they have not broken contracts in the past and breach of contract like this should be punished as it normally is.  Which should include the ability to nullify the contract and receive reimbursement.  Imagine if Hyundai had to repay the MBTA because of their delays and after they do that they're stuck with semi-functional train cars designed for a buyer who isn't interested."

Diguiseppimon,news,1391014756.0,"The only reason I haven't is because I started using CareOne debt consolidation about two years ago. My friend had gone through bankruptcy and told me if he had to do it all over again, he wished he would've consolidated his debt instead, and told me about them. I gave them a call, cried on the phone while the lady was incredibly sympathetic, she helped me figure out a budget (back then I was making considerably less than I do now, but even now I can still barely afford any bigger payments), and told me the steps to take. At the time of the big hospital bill, I had JUST started a new job after being laid off for 4 months, and the hospital was unwilling to work with me when it came to lowering payments (the least they would do was $50 a month from EACH department, which totaled to over $400 a month), and wouldn't set up appointments to come in and talk about the bill (I worked the same hours that they were open, and I could NOT take off work). So when I called CareOne, they helped me set stuff up, and although it took a few months, I no longer get phone calls every other hour (not kidding on that either!), no longer have a full mailbox every day, and they take care of everything, I just pay them. I was paying more, but I came across some financial stuff, and they let me lower my payment. I just haven't updated it yet. Quite frankly, for what the hospital said, and didn't do to help at all (basically told me that they didn't know what was wrong, but if I went to my *regular doctor* they would know how to help!!), I don't feel I should pay them a dime.

""What about circumcision?"" ""Well, I had mine as a kid, so they just did the blood drop thing."" 

""Okay. Welcome.""

That is what happens in my Conservative synagogue. That is what I think happens in most Conservative synagogues today.

I cannot imagine that conversation taking place in Orthodox, because I  assume the Orthodox would ask questions about the beit din, at minimum (I assume they'd also ask about some beliefs, some lifestyle, about mikvah, about brit milah/hatafat dam brit?)

But according to my understanding, Conservative rabbis will accept a beit din of Reform or Reconstructionist or Renewal rabbis. Even though we don't agree on halakah with them.


&gt;The distinction you're making is not really there.

Unless you can also say ""Orthodox rabbis will accept a beit din of Conservative or Reform or Reconstructionist or Renewal rabbis. Even though they don't agree on halakah with them.""  then I'm still not understanding why my original statement is false. 

Because that ""ritual done, even if not to our standards"" test is a key difference to me between Orthodox and Conservative rejections of conversions done by other movements. I think what I hear you and others saying is ""but wait, both Conservative and Orthodox have standards that must be met and if you don't meet their standards, it won't be accepted."" Which I totally agree with.  The difference is what our standard for conversion performed by other Jewish groups is.

I'm not aware of other non-Orthodox rabbis fulfilling the requirements to sit on a beit din that the Orthodox movement accepts for purposes of geirus.

I am aware of other non-Conservative rabbis fulfilling the requirements to sit on a beit din that the Conservative movement accepts for purposes of geirus.

&gt;It's possible, even probable, that some Conservative conversions might be acceptable in the eyes of Orthodoxy, but the chances are so small that it's not worth considering (possibly unless a convert would undertake to prove that this was the case. Obviously the circumstances under which it will be considered will differ by community/beis din/rabbi).

How does this, in practice, result in something different than ""not our beit din, not valid?""

I""m not trying to be difficult or stubborn or obtuse. I just really don't understand how the statement is false."

After my fiancée and I are done with the day, dinner, and the gym we usually just veg on the couch and are totally unproductive. So we made a rule, after every show, be it 30 minutes or an hour we do a 10 minute productivity break. We will clean, do dishes, pack lunches for the next day, put laundry away, do paperwork, ect. It is extremely manageable in 10 minute chunks and you would be shocked at how much you get done. This may seem like common sense for most people but we are exceptionally lazy."

My attempt at an explanation is that there is a streak in American society that highly values...maybe even 'idolizes' is the right word...independence, heroic effort, self-reliance, and ""pulling yourself up by your bootstraps"" as the saying goes.  A kind of first corollary of this philosophical streak is that government should be small, unobtrusive, and have very little power.  This trend in American society has been around for a long, long time; arguably dating back to the start of the country (look up [the whiskey rebellion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky_Rebellion) for instance).

The thinking of the segment of the population which is either openly opposed or else skeptical about nationalized health care using a single-payer model is that people ought to be able to fend for themselves.  The country and society should be organized in such a way that people are free to make whatever decisions they want, and are personally responsible for the consequences of those decisions.

Note that I'm neither promoting nor rebutting this outlook, simply asserting that it is a philosophical underpinning that many Americans subscribe to, and a fair amount of our national political debate can be understood by looking through this prism.  Hope that helps you understand!"

You wouldn't want to debate the Iraq war with a soldier, for example, because many of them personally identify with the decision to go to war even though they had no power over it, and you wouldn't ask a fat person why Americans are so fat.  We also tend to avoid discussing politics with coworkers, because there are some people who can't have productive relationships with people they disagree with politically, and it's a bad idea to poison work relationships.  With those limitations, discussing politics is an American pastime.  

It goes a lot better than you would think, because people are naturally more polite in person, and when two random Americans meet they usually aren't as partisan and vitriolic as the people you see on television.  Imagine a society in which many normal people compete intensely in their spare time at [football and basketball](http://i.imgur.com/ONlfDir.jpg), but the only sport on TV is [WWE](http://i.imgur.com/FxUXL3E.jpg).

Sometimes people speak their personal opinion and the person their speaking to assumes they're speaking for their entire their gender, race, religion etc.  Other times people ARE attempting to  speak for their race, gender, etc, but when they do so they are generally incorrect in their assumption that everyone from the same background shares those same opinions.  Most likely you are confused because of one of those two reasons.  Like I said.  Some women care.  Others don't.  Stop taking eithers word as bond. When someone says an opinion, just assume they're only speaking for themselves, because that is most likely the case. "

He plays around with word choice and tone to reflect his fictional authors, he changes terms as needed to preserve an ancient feeling to the language, and all of his descriptions of terrain serve a greater thematic purpose. For instance, compare sections like *The Mirror of Galadriel* to the chapters with Merry and Pippin among the Ents. The language shifts dramatically as Frodo, the rather high-minded and would-be-poetic witness of the Mirror sequences, now relies on Merry and Pippin for their memory of dialog. The dialog is much more fanciful, less full of metaphor and more emotive. Little changes like that are used to keep the translation convention alive, and demonstrate a living world and a story that goes well beyond the words on the page, conveyed solely through stylistic choices."

What we end up with is a culture where we start out with no experience, knowing we are supposed to find ""the one"", and (to use an analogy) we walk into the ice cream store, try one flavor, and agonize over it for a year and a half trying to figure out if we want it for life, and then after mourning our loss that we didn't like it enough, we try a different flavor, and agonize again, and again, and again.

What we need is to change our expectations. Stop expecting to marry our childhood sweethearts or just have that one special relationship and instead plan to have several relationships in school with low expectations where we learn who we are, who others are, the different ways that relationships can be, and what we want. And then, when we get to a point where we have a good foundation, and have learned about ourselves and others, we can look at the flavors and make informed decisions, and if a new flavor comes around, you can evaluate it based on your past experience and have a pretty good idea of what it will taste like, instead of just sticking it in your mouth and agonizing over whether or not it might be ""the one."""

andjok,DebateAnarchism,1391015616.0,"&gt; if you aren't defending this system of enterprise (i'm going to assume i know what you mean by that phrase, so if i'm wrong, then most of what else i'm saying may not be relevant), am i to assume that you believe the methods used to provide the startup capital for our current society are not compatible with the type of system you are espousing?

Kinda sorta.  I think the current state of privilege and wealth inequality is due mainly to corporate cronyism, corporate personhood, subsidies, state intervention in markets, intellectual property, eminent domain, central banking/monopoly money, etc., which favors already established corporations and the well connected and makes it harder for newcomers to compete.  I do not think it is because of wage labor in itself, because in a market of maximum competition profit margins would be much smaller.  I think the concept of wage labor is fine as long as the employer received their wealth through voluntary contracts.

As a libertarian, I try to focus more on how people got their wealth rather than how much they have.  Did they get wealthy because they started a business that produces superior products?  Awesome.  Did they get wealthy because they lobbied for special privileges, got free land through eminent domain, used patents to keep others from copying their products, etc?  Not cool.

&gt;if this is the case, would this not mean that, in order to go from the current system of enterprise to your preferred system of enterprise, all or most currently held property would need to be abolished and/or redistributed?

I'm not morally opposed to the idea.  Even Rothbard favored workers becoming ""homesteaders"" and seizing property from those who benefited from state intervention, such as companies involved in the military industrial complex, universities, government property, big banks, etc.  However, I'm not sure how feasible or practical that idea might be, but I think that if enough people managed to build a true free market outside of state control (/r/agorism) that large, monolithic corporations could be threatened; I think a true free market would be their biggest threat in fact.

&gt;yes, and this is likely the direction our society is going in[1] , when the rich have no need for the poor, and are able to use automation to live a lavish lifestyle, while everyone else slowly dies

Even in our current corporate system I don't think that's necessarily true.  Every time there's major improvement in technology people worry that it's going to cause massive unemployment, yet what it really does is make things more affordable and free up people to do better and more productive things.  If automation is so great that no human labor is ever needed, why wouldn't it be used to provide for everyone?  It's not like all rich people *hate* the poor and want them to suffer (though I'm sure some might), they're just self interested like everyone else.  Besides, I think there are some things that human labor will always be useful for, especially art and entertainment.

&gt;no, but if we know that there is an added inherent risk that is always going to be present in a particular system or type of system, and we can see throughout history how billions of people have been repeatedly fucked over within that type of system, i'm just saying maybe we could give something else a shot, rather than admitting defeat before we even begin.

I do want to give something else a shot.  I just don't think we need to completely abolish the idea of wage labor to do that.

&gt;ok, then i'm not sure why you previously said ""...because often the business fails and the owners/investors don't make back their investment (and have lost money, while also having done work to start up the business), whereas the workers have received payment..."" if there is no guarantee that that is the case

Well sure there is no guarantee, but typically what happens when starting a business is that the owner(s) must take care of all expenses, including wages, before they see any profits.  Of course the owner(s) need money to live as well, but they must either use what they have saved up or go into debt to do so.

&gt;my bad i misremembered, i never really did much of an explanation regarding how acquiring profit or capital necessitates stealing (for lack of a better word) from someone else, but i'm going to assume you understand how capital works and i don't need to explain it. but, as adam smith said, ""Wherever there is great property there is great inequality. For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor, and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many.""

I understand the socialist argument of how profit is theft and I don't buy that it is inherently so because it can be acquired through voluntary contracts and also because of time preference (worker prefers to get paid slightly less up front for producing something that is sold later on for a higher price; capitalist prefers to hold off on getting paid now for the possibility of profit later on).  Though I acknowledge that the system has been greatly manipulated by a few major players to reap more profits than they would if faced with full competition, and I can see how it appears in this economy that wage labor is tantamount to extortion.  If most people have the choice between working for a wage or joining a coop/owning a business I don't think it could be considered theft, could it?"

Taking a leap here to assume that the Other's have any more animosity towards the Starks than any other family in Westeros.  And, do the Bolton's have any animosity towards the Starks that isn't driven by an urge to end up on the winning side?

I'm an atheist too, but I don't have any misconceptions about whether or not others should be forced to believe in my worldview. They'll come to it on their own, or they won't -- it's that simple.

Sometimes that isn't always an option. Also, if you dislike the US, move. Right back at you. I like living in a statist system, and if you don't like it, why don't you move? =P

&gt;Hardly. The game is still being played, we're not at the finish line, and religion isn't looking so strong now. 

They said the same thing during the enlightenment. I wouldn't say its's down for the count just yet. Especially if you give people the ability to cloister themselves in and filter out any opposing information.

&gt;Moreover, religion now takes a backseat to secularism in the world's foremost nations -- if that isn't clear evidence that truth and freedom are stronger than lies and authoritarianism, I don't know what is.

If you get rid of the state, you'll undo all that progress. It's only because we have an environment that encourages freedom of thought that this is happening. It's not happening in Muslim countries, for example, that kill you for having an opposing point of view. It won't happen if you allow communities to devolve back into theocracies either.

&gt; In fact, religion has only survived for so long because of information control and force -- even in the face of such overwhelming odds, truth leaked out and has resulted in the world we see today. 

And by eliminating our state and its freedoms, you're encouraging people to form communities that would ostracize, if not kill atheists and nonbelievers. We tried theocracy in the past. It was more tyrannical than anything we have now. Which is why religious freedom was so important to this country. Dissolve the constitution and you'll devolve society.

&gt; Even though I vehemently disagree with Christians on many subjects, I can't say that they're precisely treated well online, or even in the media these days.

We're not burning them at the stake or throwing them in water and seeing if they float either. And we aren't torturing them to 'save their souls"". Let me frame it in YOUR terms. You're proposing that we'd throw out the ""free market"" of ideas, so that smaller societal units can establish respective ""monopolies"" on information. If you view this issue through your free market lens, you know it be true.

It used to be catholic services were done in latin, the Bible was written and read in latin, and that allowed catholics to have a monopoly on the religion.

Then the bible was translated, and this allowed people who believed in it to question the church. Because they were free to read it themselves and come up with their own interpretations. This broke the ""monopoly"" the catholics had. Even today, the Amish sometimes don't like their parishoners reading non German bibles or whatever....because they don't like them having information to question their decisions.

Now we have internet, which has allowed atheistic ideas to spread, and in the free market of ideas, religion is doing poorly, because quite frankly, they don't have anything to stand on but excuses, fallacies, and appeals to faith (which is precisely why I'm no longer a christian, things weren't adding up and christians had nothing to stand on). But let's not forget what got us here, and that's an environment in which we're free to express our views without fear of retaliation. You eliminate that, and you will bring back the controls over information. You will bring back censorship. You will undo all progress that has been done on this matter. 

There are things worse than the state. You allow people to exert control over others in a more direct and populist fashion and you'll see a lot of oppression. Also, what if your little communes or whatever go all Jonestown on us? I can see it happening, with no state to stop it. That's why Jim Jones left the US to go to south america. To establish HIS vision of society without state intervention. And look at how horrid that turned out. Your ideal world is a breeding ground for cults. 

&gt;re you so fearful that you think that there would be nothing BUT theocracies?

I think a good half of them at least would be. Especially in the south.

&gt;but if they just want to retreat into their own little community and stick around like-minded people... isn't that what you want? For them to stop sticking their noses in your business?

Such a community would be oppressive for the free thinker though, since the second you step out of line you'll either be exiled or possibly killed if we devolve enough. Try reading about the crap new atheists from /r/atheism have to put up with. Kicked out of their homes, in some former religions, shunned, and quite frankly, given the lack of law preventing such things, we actually could see real violence. It's happening in theocratic countries around the world.

And that's the thing. You can say what you want about the state being oppressive, but get rid of it and it can always be made MORE oppressive."

Eh, yeah, I agree that they *should* have waited to have kids if they're making minimum wage but you can't blame that all on them. Many people lost good jobs over the past 6 years and a minimum-wage city job was the best they could get to support their families. I don't think it's really fair to tell people ""you're poor so you don't deserve to have children"". Not saying that's your stance or anything, but I hear a lot of people on this site with those kinds of sentiments. 

You're right that this won't make a substantial difference to the city's economy but it's one of the first results of this $15 minimum wage debate. I don't think we should immediately hike up the city minimum wage because that would really hurt small businesses and the unemployed. But I do think it would be good if we made some efforts to increase the wages for the workers of Seattle over time. There's a balanced approach somewhere (eg $1 wage increase per year until $15) and we should definitely have that discussion, and see how the Sea-Tac and Seattle City Hall workers pan out."

tsarnickolas,paradoxplaza,1391015936.0,"I'm inclined to agree about there being too many christian kingdoms in spain, but as for the de-jure kingdoms, It seems totally normal for the day that the difference between kingdom and petty kingdom was just a matter of prominence. I think leaving areas should not be without a de-jure kingdom to form, though, unless a lot more titular kingdoms were to be added in to make it so that any independent megaduke in an area with no dejure kingdom could have a titular kingdom to create, which will eventually become dejure. The ones that exist right now are simply not enough. I think that something similar should exist with empires, but with some other special requirements involving prestige and some kind of religious measure. 

Anyways, I stand by what I said about Arabia, because at the time of the game, there is precedent for a great Arabian empire, and likewise Canute the great recieved Fealty from the king of Scotland, suggesting an empire level title. It could be either Scandinavia or Britannia, but it hadn't just based that off of him owning a large part of Scandinavia. 

So, I could see a much improved and more sophisticated de-jure system being possible, but unless they are actually going to go the distance, then arbitrarily granting permanent hard-favoritism to certain kingdoms merely because they existed in history at a certain point, even though the player games will inevitably become more and more historical the more they are played, seems like a bad Idea to me.  What I mean by that, is not that history is irrelevant, but that players who replicate the scenarios that made those kingdoms legitimate ought to be likewise rewarded. "

FF3,whowouldwin,1391016076.0,"Your average zoo enclosure has torn down trees, ropes, etc -- stuff that could be fashioned into weapons by clever humans and football players (I jest).   Given time, regardless of the Round, the football players will be able to fashion a strategy and, more importantly, tools, in order to defeat the tiger with no deaths, and maybe only treatable wounds on one or two players. (Pads actually don't help, I don't think -- they aren't made to protect against the slashing or tearing or shaking of cats, and they leave open a lot of body area.)


So, in my estimation, the only hope the tiger has is a rush.  What chance is there for a rush?


[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_attack#Reasons_for_attacking) suggests that tigers are unlikely to attack humans unless they believe that they have been injured, provoked, or have already acquired the taste for human flesh [for instance, through eating human remains].  Even then however, they are unlikely to attack except from ambush, and will interrupt their attack if an ambush is detected..  Note the [fact](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/05/science/face-masks-fool-the-bengal-tigers.html) that Indians wear masks backwards to convince tigers not to attack because the tiger believes that they're being watched.  A group of 10 NFL players will be able to keep their eyes on the tiger at all times, and thus keep it from believing it can succeed in an attack long enough for a proper tiger killing weapon to be fashioned from the stuff in the enclosure."

miked4o7,politics,1391016116.0,"&gt; This is what we've always done. We release known murderers from prison all the time because of botched evidence handling, improper procedure, etc.

I don't think we've generally released foreign suspected terrorists that were never US citizens into the US after not convicting them.

&gt;Everyone deserves to stand trail and face their accusers. What's so offensive about Guantanamo is it seems to be a special place insulated from standards of justice which we have held for hundreds of years.
The notion that someone is ""too dangerous to release but cannot be prosecuted"" is absurd. It's an affront to all notions of justice. The pentagon is not and has never been even remotely a substitute for a jury.

I completely agree.  I'm not suggesting infinite detainment is acceptable.

&gt;If I were Obama, right now, I would issue an order that any detainee at Guantanamo Bay on March 31, 2014 shall receive a full and unconditional pardon, and immediate release

Into the US?  So you'd have Obama force Immigration Services to issue special visas or something?  This solution might be technically possible, but it doesn't seem plausible.

&gt;The reality is, those prisoners who are being held against their will without being charged should have been released a long time ago.

Yeah, I really do agree.  The blame here though is more reasonably put on Congress.

jianadaren1,Android,1391016332.0,"Well that depends.

In a world with no competition and desperate customers then sure, instead of buying a 16 GB phone + a 16 GB SD card for $420, now we're forced to buy a 32GB phone for $500.

But this is a world with competition among the handset makers and customers who have lots of options (the most powerful one being simply a refusal to buy anything). So likely what's going to happen is that people will buy fewer 16GB phones (because they're less valuable without extra SD storage) and so the price of 16GB phones will plummet. So right there, people who don't need much storage benefit from cheaper phones.

For people who need more storage it's a little more complicated. Now they have to buy internal storage, but will that be more expensive than the status quo? If sales of low-storage are too low, then the makers will simply drop those models, increasing the storage size of the base model. This is what happened with the iPhone - 1st-gen had a base storage a 4GB and by 5th-gen we had base storage of 16GB. So for people with intermediate storage needs, they also end up ahead - as the base size grew their upgrades became free.

People with large storage needs are probably SOL though, they'll be forced to pay through the nose.

These different customer cases show the symptoms of the underlying economics behind it - useful SD cards have the inherent advantage of flexible and upgradeable storage space. But they are also a crutch that gives a lifeline to too-small devices. Furthermore, there's both a performance and manufacturing cost benefit of increasing internal memory vs adding an SD card.

So whether or not a customer benefits from this depends on what you value - if you love massive, flexible storage then you're likely getting boned. If you're cool with smaller, fixed storage then you're winning as you're likely getting cheaper and/or bigger devices."
Burlapin,Dinosaurs,1391016336.0,"I've never thought about this before.  I think you can probably draw parallels between some modern reptiles and dinosaurs; if you look at alligator arms for instance, they have bone, tendon, muscle, and fat.

&gt; Let me be clear, I have no problem if you're swamped at work and can't go out. As much as I would like to see you, I do understand that work can get hectic sometimes. I've had the same issue at my work and had to go a week or more without seeing you because I was working such long hours.

&gt; What is starting to frustrate me though is that you keep making plans with me, insisting you can make them, and then blowing me off without saying you got held up. Even plans we make to have a phone conversation he blows off.

&gt; An example is a few nights ago you asked me if I was free that night to talk on the phone. You wanted to see how I was doing and set up plans for this weekend. I tell you that I'm free, and you ask me to tell you when I'm home from work. I text you letting you know I'm free to talk whenever you are, and I hear nothing the rest of the night.

&gt; I figure something popped up last minute at work for you, and while a quick ""still at work"" text or something would have been nice, I don't get upset. The next morning though when I ask how work went the night before you tell me it was crazy but you left before I had even left work myself. I'm guessing you did some work at home, but it wasn't a case where you were running around the office all night and couldn't reach me. You completely blew off our planned phone call (which you planned) and didn't even acknowledge it.

&gt; That is what is starting to frustrate me a lot at this point."

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1391016487.0,"In college I found out that I there were two girls who stalked me for the better part of a **year.** A mutual friend had told me that they started a habit of following me to my classes, learning my habits, watching me at the gym, etc. The casualness with which she described their activities as though they were just some kind of hobby was eye-opening. If the genders were reversed, the campus police would have been involved within minutes. *That* was certainly unnerving.

I don't view the term ""creepy"" the same way a lot of women seem to. These days, women generally employ terms like ""creepy"" as a synonym for ""not good/attractive enough for my attention."" They can't actually say that less they sound entitled or full of themselves, so it's better to paint themselves in the role of a potential victim. 

""Unwanted attention"" isn't creepy. It's just annoying. There have been times where I've been hit on by women who just weren't my type, and others where they were coming on way too strong and making far too many assumptions about their chances. I never considered them to be ""creepy"" though. Presumptuous? Tactless? Entitled? Sure. But I don't consider unsolicited advances to be threatening. I make my boundaries known and move on with my life."
ChangloriousBastard,nba,1391016488.0,"I feel so bad for Webber on this.  Had he won the championship in 2002, he'd go down as one of the best PF's of all time.  

Look at his per game statline for 2000-2001:

27.1 points, 11.1 rebounds, 4.3 assists, 1.3 steals, 1.7 blocks, 11.0 winshare

To say he was dominant was an understatement.  He was every bit as good as Duncan, KG and Dirk at the time (if not better in a lot of areas), yet he'll never be remembered on that level.  And I think it's all because of some shitty officiating.  If we changed a few calls in Game 6 of the 2002 WCF, Webber goes from a likely HOFer to a no-questions-asked, first ballot dude.  

His legacy if he got that ring: Webber would be remembered as one of the best PFs in an era of great PFs.  He'd be in the conversation for best passing big man in history as well as one of the top 5 players at his position.  He'd shake his timeout legacy and be remembered as a winner.  Truthfully, I think he'd be remembered as being better than KG and Dirk but behind Duncan, though his career numbers wouldn't be as high due to injuries.  

His legacy without the ring: He retains the ""choker"" reputation.  His talent is forgotten.  He's known as a pretty good player that had some bad breaks and was foiled by injury.  He's likely to make the HOF, but he isn't a lock.  "

simplebouy,Paleo,1391016624.0,"cut &amp; paste from a mail I wrote to my brother, this is my idiot-proof indian recipe: 
It doesnt matter what kind of meat, Ive used pretty much everything, but normally stick with chicken.  whatever youre using, it works best if the meat is marianated for at least 12 hours, then added to the sauce which you can also prepare earlier.  I quite often make a huge pot of the base sauce and freeze most of it to save time and effort later on.

Marianade
2 big spoons of plain yoghurt.  Not low fat, it doesn't work as well. 
2 teaspoons each of cumin, coriander powder, turmeric, chilli powder, powdered ginger. To make it a bit simpler, you can just use garam masala and chilli powder.
A squirt of lemon or lime juice

If they're big bits of chicken, I score them with a sharp knife, but for normal sized chunks (1"" ish) then it's fine.  Skin off.  Thighs are better than breast meat, they seem to have a better flavour.

Base sauce
Ghee is better than oil, but oil is fine.  Use a couple of spoons of either. 
Add a bit of cinnamon stick (about 2""), 3 or 4 cloves, half a dozen gently squashed cardamom pods to the hot oil for a couple of minutes, then add a couple of spoons of cumin seeds and some chopped ginger and garlic.

The house should smell amazing! 

Add a tin or two of chopped tomatoes, before the garlic burns. Add a ce of teaspoons of sugar, or a big dollop of ketchup.  Let it simmer for an hour or two, tasting a couple of times to see if it needs more chilli. if you've overdone the spice, add more sugar or desiccated coconut to tone it down a bit

When you think it looks done, scoop out the cinnamon and, if you can find them, the cardamom pods - they're not good to bite into...

This is a great base sauce for all kinds of curry.  Adding a tin of coconut milk makes it taste completely different (and lovely) and its fab with meat or veg.

To make the final curry, just add the marianated meat or veg (eg cauliflower, okra, aubergine or mushroom) and let it cook for  while - anything from 10 mins to hour, depending on what's in there... 

Tadka daal is easy too, it's the same start as for the base sauce up until the tomatoes, except more cumin seed, some black poppy seed and no cloves or cinnamon.  Then instead of tomatoes you add some cooked lentils/split peas and let it cook for a bit.

She was 19, didn't realize that I was talking shit, found me attractive and we ended having a one night stand. 

Shortly after words I posted a honest yet humorous [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/1hax5x/the_definitive_heterosexual_male_ok_cupid_dating/) on OK Cupid so that men could replicate my experience. The thread was immediately downvoted by bitter obese feminists. Which bothered me because I felt it was thoughtful and well written.

This made me realized how strong the anti-male opinion was on Reddit, this frustrated me, so I decided that I was going to make women feel this frustration. I visited predominantly female Reddits and tried to start shit. I asked lesbians the best way to literally come out of a closet. I went on the makeup subreddit and gave male advice: Hey Im a dude, and I think you should use blue eyeliner. I went on /askwomen and asked why only women drown babies in bathtubs. This generated down votes and bans and generally slowed my trolling progress. But It gave me lols. :)

Then I found Bluepill. I could post on Red Pill get encouragement from my internet bros and harvest the mad on Blue Pill. It was a dream come true. The best part was I would never get banned and the more mad I generated the better I would do. I could spend twenty minutes making a short post on redpill and within a day I would find a massive rage post on bluepill analyzing every hastily written word and punctuation mistake.

 These people are spending **hours** brooding in hate because of me. There are long,meticulously written [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/comments/1hfgle/in_which_rtrp_just_comes_out_and_says_that_women/catv4o3) criticizing my writing. I assume this one  coming from an (unemployed) grad student of some sort.

Not only are they mad but im *triggering* them making them relapse into over-eating, under-eating, depression (all in their own words). Not only were these bluepillers mad, I  ruining their lives ,with just 20 min of hastily typed text!

For me this is the absolute Jackpot of trolling entitled western women, I really couldn't ask for more. Id like to thank the Redpillers and the Blue Pillers for making this possible."

Wuffles70,fatlogic,1391016687.0,"Apparently, it was about the same as your marathon time, yikes! Honestly though, I had to look it up on her blog because the time never meant that much to me - she was **very** into meeting this goal she'd plotted out but I was just happy to be doing it! The heart scare and bed rest had made me feel very weak, I would get exhausted from walking to the shops and back a couple of months before, so I was thrilled to be there and walking on sunshine the entire way. ""We've been walking for hours and I feel like shit - this is amazing!"" etc etc. I think it got a little annoying for everyone towards the end, haha! 

I think it ended up being something like 1.5 hours added on the time she wanted - part of that was because the rest stops involved massive queues for some reason, even if you just wanted to pass straight through (and we had to stop for the bathroom a couple of times... yeah, we're going to plan our pre-race diet more for the next one!), and the other issue was at one point she had some very dodgy pains in her ankle so we stopped for about 20 minutes to check it out and make sure she wasn't about to damage anything. When you're that heavy, continuing to walk on a damaged ankle can fuck it up really fast and she really wants to go en pointe when she's small enough so I wanted to make absolutely sure she was OK before continuing. The major demotivator for her wasn't the stops, though, it was that we slowed down to something like 2.5-3.5mph for the last mile or two. My friend was super upset by it but she weighed something like 280lbs and it was her first distance ANYTHING so I was really proud, even if she wasn't at first. She's doing the Great North Run next time it rolls around and we'll be doing the same walking half marathon with her original time goal in mind this year - She's gonna make it and I couldn't be happier for her. 

Honestly, my issue with the 12 hour marathon isn't the time so much as the complaints about the staff and that things had closed along the way. Even with the walking half marathon, I thought it just seemed like such a dull job to be standing on a corner cheering people on in the cold - it was clearly something they really cared about and I can't imagine being that mean to someone who was doing something selfless. It feels a little like throwing the race organisers and volunteers under the bus to complain that they couldn't stay set up for that long and I really don't like that - it tramples on the spirit of the whole thing.

Then after taking TRP I had a talked with my brother and sister about our childhood.  

Turns out I completely repressed my mother and dissociated.  

She was a bitch.  To the point where my sister truly believes our mother didn't love us.

I spent years putting my mother on a pedestal, thinking she was radiant and amazing.  Turns out it was all selective memories and beliefs.  I think what truly was happening was dissociation.  As a kid, the trauma was too much so I created a reality where my mother was nurturing and loving, despite it not being reality.  But it was the only way to deal with it.

We want our mothers to be that way.  As children, we need it.  But that's not the reality.  The reality is they are women.  Most likely, they didn't want us.  They didn't love us, because they can't.  They would rather us ""toughen up"" then be there for us.  And their love, affection, praise was NOT unconditional.

So two parent families didn't always have loving mothers.  And nowadays, I'm truly shocked when I observe a mother ACTUALLY loving and nurturing her son.

2) A whole list of things the federal government already does badly that it should never have started doing in the first place.

The federal government does a great job at national defense (no wonder, with all the money we throw at it), building and maintaining roads and highways, and a very small handful of other things.  Everything else it tries to do it fucks up.  Take it from someone who spent almost a decade in the military: The last thing you want is for the federal government to be in charge of your health care."
JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391016950.0,"&gt; You didn't answer the question I asked. I asked who is better suited for ""determining the optimum choices for one's life - the individual actually living that life or some authority who is, at best, working off of a statistical model?"" There's nothing in there about ""govern(ing) for all,"" and since the precise thing we're trying to determine here is whether ""governing for all"" is of merit, you're begging the question by wedging it in there like that.

I think it depends on the situation at hand. Sometimes I think that the individual is better, but sometiems the individual isn't the smartest cookie in the box and makes bad decisions, and I think the state needs to protect against some very blatantly bad decisions. And sometimes the state creates new options that you wouldn't otherwise have.

That being said, I don't think it's fair to force me to choose, because it's situational.

&gt;The ""real world data"" to which you're referring is necessarily generalized - it does not and cannot apply to each individual. How can it be an ""optimum"" approach to force decisions based on such generalizations even on people to whom they do not apply?

But at the same time, it can be used to create more good than harm. Sorry, I dont think everything would be all swell and good if people are left to make their own choices, because I dont buy into the pictuesque model you're trying to portray here. For example, if you're starving or ahve the opportunity to be a wage slave, you're gonna be a wage slave, but does that mean it's a good choice? No, to achieve the BEST results, you need government intervention. Don't try to oversimplify reality here.

&gt;Who is this ""we"" to whom you're referring, and why does this ""we"" get to make decisions for other people? 

Human beings. Because we can achieve better results this way.

Beyond that, you're just asking the same question over and over and over again, and I'm repeating myself. So no, I don't think things are ALWAYS best left to the individual. It SOUNDS nice in theory, and you've obviously bought into this picturesque theoretical picture, but such a world is ugly in reality. 

&gt;However, a gradual dissolution, with individuals simply opting out as they come to realize that they're better qualified to manage their own decisions than any third party could ever possibly be, would almost certainly lead to much better results for all.

I disagree, I think it would lead to exploitation.

&gt;Why? Because, if humanity survives long enough, anarchism will come naturally, just as adulthood comes to individuals.

I disagree. I see the future being the welfare states of western Europe. Humans are interconnected, and our decisions can harm others, and people can be led, like sheep, to accept things that given a better environment they would not accept to begin with. That being said, government provides that environment, and while you give up some freedom, it's to have more freedom overall.

&gt;The history of government is the history of an individual. We rose from the infancy of tribalism to the childhood of feudalism, then to the awkward adolescence of representative democracy, with its alternately comforting and stifling combination of freedom and constraint. We will continue to grow, and as we do, we will, just as we have all along the way, have less need and less desir

I'll agree with you, but no offense, your ideas seem REGRESSIVE to me, not PROGRESSIVE. I do agree, we're evolving, socially. But I see us not moving toward anarchy, but once again, the welfare states of western Europe.

What I ultimately would like to see, is a star trek like society, advanced, and free. I'm hoping to see stuff happen in my life time, like automation freeing people from the bonds of manual labor, for example. But this is gonna be problematic with an anarcho capitalist perspective though. Quite frankly, I think as time goes on, capitalism is gonna become dysfunctional and hold us back. it's a great system that works in times of scarcity, and I think it will probably always have SOME relevance because there will always be scarcity, but I think it will become less relevant. What I'd like to see in the future, is a society without scarcity. One built on technology that gives us everythinf we need. And one that ultimately frees us from most kinds of work. As far as I'm concerned, as long as you have to spend so much time working for mere survival, that isn't freedom. True freedom comes from being able to live life as we want. But capitalism doesn't provide us with this path, for the long term. Because we will always be bound by scarcity and work. Under capitalism, there's never the incentive to overproduce, for instance. It always produces just enough to maximize profit, and no more,a nd this means people will always be excluded. It will just keep reinforcing patterns of artificial scarcity to feed the profit motive, and this will keep society on a tread mill. I feel that no matter how rich we become, under pure capitalism, people will always in poverty. And while in the past, this was a necessity, in the future, it is something that is artificial and unnecessary, and therefore, increasingly immoral. So we need governments to behave in a benevolent sense in order to produce conditions to encourage overproduction. To me, market distortions are sometimes a good thing. And unemployment? Only a problem if we keep going with this property rights absolutism and fruit of your own labor crap. View things on a bigger scale, and I can see in the future a small number of capitalists creating everything we need via automation, and distributed via automation, to the people. But this kind of vision will never come to pass if we say it's wrong with absolute moral imperative, to tax the rich and redistribute wealth. And that's why I think libertarianism is gonna be problematic in the future. We're getting to a point, where we have enough to provide for everyone, but we don't. We will get to the point in the future where masses of people will be thrown out of work in favor of machines, and unless we adapt to the times, there will be great human suffering. And quite honestly, capitalism worship, I see as just causing problems in the future. It needs to bend, to adapt to the times, to be used for the greater good of humanity, not against it.

And that's why I don't think anarcho capitalism is the way of the future. If anything, I think it would hold us back. I think it would keep people enslaved by work, and I think those who own all the property would welcome it as a source of cheap labor. And if they do automate, they will throw everyone out of work and leave them to starve. So, yeah, I hagve a way different perspective on this. We need more government, not less. But we also need to make sure the government behaves in ways beneficial to the people, not in ways to favor private interests. "

You take a dump on your desk and try to pass that off as good work? You get demoted. There's no way to leave this company unless you become upper level management and then do such good work that you're eligible for retirement. As a CEO, you could still royally screw up and get demoted. As a drone, you could do wonderfully and get promoted. There are no limitations on movement like that. It's all about the work expected of your position compared to the work you actually do at your position.

You, as a human, happen to be at the highest level. If you go on a murderous rampage, you'll probably come back as an insect. If you cure polio (thanks, Salk!) you'll theoretically come back as a wealthy or highly educated or very good looking human. If you're a cow that does a cow's duty (dharma) well, you'll come back as a human. If you're a slightly subpar human, you'll come back as a cow. 

Yes, humans are the only ones that can achieve enlightenment. But that doesn't mean a fish will always be born a fish will again come back as a fish.

Pleasure pain principle.

&gt;When does something which hurts an individual become helpful to all?

When it does. This is kind of a tautology.

&gt;One murder is a crime, a thousand is riot control, and millions are a successful war? No. Violence is violence. Murder is murder. Theft is theft. Scale does not matter.

To destroy life is to defeat the purpose of any morality.

I don't know what you mean by being on financially better footing, but depending on the girl, this doesn't matter. You just have to look for girls in the right contexts. It's completely fine just to go to coffee on the first date, when you are just feeling out whether you get along well. There are lots of fun things you can do that don't cost money, if you are creative. 

It sounds like you're looking at this as something you need to wait until you are prepared for. In reality, the only thing you'll prepare yourself for is to look back and regret not living life to the fullest. You will never be ready.  It sucks for everyone at first. You're not alone. 

I think you're going to be unhappy if you don't put yourself out there and ask some women out.  Everyone gets rejected, even the guys who pick women up successfully all the time. The more times you ask, the higher chance you have of getting a date. That's just the way it works.

With the white dot on the red paper in white light (which, again, is a combination of all colors) the red paper reflects only the red portions of the white light while the white dot reflects the white (or, more correctly, ALL of the tones) bouncing off of it.

I suggest this, once the grief and sense of loss calms the fuck down: *regardless of his intentions*, think about some of the things he said and see if they could be valid concerns.  What gave him those impressions of you?  If you don't make decisions well, then practice making decisions.  If you're ""boring"", find challenging hobbies and master them.  

You can either ignore what he said and not change, or you can use this as an opportunity to grow and improve as a person.  Sometimes people need a boot in the ass to do that.

mr_fishy,polyamory,1391017456.0,"Honestly, I'd agree with the whole sentiment of ""only they are responsible for what happens between the two of them."" This girl's boyfriend does not own her - she is capable of making her own decisions about who she wants to be with. If he can't handle that, then perhaps they aren't meant to be together. But that's up to the two of them.

You are totally separate from them. What you do with this girl is not up to the boyfriend, it's up to you and her. Of course there are potential consequences for anything you do, but it seems to me like you're coming at this from the perspective of ""If I act on my feelings for her and she and her boyfriend break up, it will be my fault."" In reality, if she is poly and her boyfriend is mono, that mismatch will be why they break up, not necessarily because of anything in particular you do. Some people just aren't sexually or romantically compatible.

To look at it a different way, imagine if there was a man and a woman who were together, but the man realized at some point he was gay and although he certainly cared for his female partner, he realized he would much rather be with another man he had connected with. Would it be the second man's fault if the first man and the woman broke up? No, it would merely be an unhappy circumstance. People can't control their sexuality or who they fall in love with, so if this girl you like and her bf end up separating that's not on you, it's just an unhappy circumstance."

schmurrr,graphic_design,1391017457.0,"I have a BFA in GD. Unfortunately, I have not heard much about online programs for GD. On the other hand, I have taken a few classes in a associate degree/continuing ed program at a different college for credits toward my BA.(Cheaper, and takes about 2 years of night classes) I can tell you that some employers prefer this associate degree because it means the students have been in the working world for a while and have that kind of experience, even if their GD skills aren't necessarily from a undergraduate degree.  
  
How familiar are you in GD, typography? Do you read about it in your own time or even make work? Unless you're going in the route of web design or user interface, I think you would owe it to yourself if you weren't able to physically receive constructive criticism or show the physical pieces in person. That was a vital part of my growth as a designer.

Good thing they are in college....do I really need to point out how good they have it?  

&gt;Lots of kids parents pay for college also. But what argument are you making? That everyone should be dragged down to the lowest level? This is the same argument republicans make about unions.  

You'll have to clarify this as you aren't making sense.  My point was that they should be happy and feel lucky that they have a scholarship and the chance to play college sports while bettering themselves with an education.  You were speaking as if they were so put upon because of this, I was simply pointing out that there are plenty of kids who have it a lot tougher than them.  I would say the kids whose parents pay are some where in between these groups.  

&gt;Ironic thing is I am an English Major and I did make my own job. Just under 300k a year on 1.5 mill a year in revenue. How are you doing?

Somehow I'm not buying it, maybe you can prove it.  

&gt;Bullshit. Forget all statistics, if all you do is match up the number of jobs to people that need them you have 3 people for every 1 job and we havent even talked about what these jobs pay  

I didn't cite any statistics....?  You have pretty poor reading comprehension for a successful English major.  

Who said to just slot people into open jobs?  This isn't East Germany...  I'm simply saying if you want a job bad enough you will find one, and if the pay isn't good enough you will find two to make things work if necessary.  Too many kids expect things to be handed to them or that they are above a couple part time jobs until they can land something significant.  

&gt;You are amazing you know shit about nothing.  

This statement proves nothing and only makes you sound like a jackass.  Also, I highly doubt that an English major who made 'my own job. Just under 300k a year' would type something as asinine as ""You know shit about nothing.""  

Have you even gotten out of community college, or maybe it's high school, yet?  You sound more like a fraud than someone making $300K a year using an English degree."

BullsLawDan,legaladvice,1391017630.0,"Well, the DOL is talking (most likely) about hourly or salaried employees.

Your employer could (and it sounds like did) make a commission agreement with you that says you lose 10% of your commissions by failing to do certain things.  It is completely legal for a company to say, ""If you do X, Y, and Z, on a sale, the sale is worth 10% of gross sticker price in commission, but if you forget X, Y, or Z, the sale is only worth 9% of gross sticker.""  

I worked in a similar situation when I sold wireless phones B2B - if I turned in the documentation same day as the sale, I got 20% of gross revenue, if I waited more than one business day to submit the properly completed documentation I only got 18%.

This isn't really ""docking pay"" in the way that the DOL employees (who are notoriously clueless about commission issues) or most other posters here would talk about.  It's not a deduction from your pay, per se, it is a change in how your commission is structured.  You get full commission if you do everything right, 90% commission if you don't.

I'm a relatively rare person in that I'm an attorney who formerly had a career in commissioned sales, so my life experience overlaps with my legal knowledge here."

MZago1,powerrangers,1391017740.0,"After rewatching it, I liked it but I know it wasn't that good. The design was great. The story had a lot of potential. I think the biggest issue was the directing. I think the biggest weak points as far as acting were Nick and Vida but I think that stems more from them not being able to maintain their accents. I don't think the actress that played Vida was bad, but those two things combined made her performance very stiff. My issue with Nick is that while he did OK with his accent, he pretty much had one volume level the entire time. Even his whisper was louder than most people's normal talking level.

As far as good things, I have to mention Chip. He has easily entered my list of favorite rangers of all time. Also, the third to last episode (I believe it was called ""The Light"") was not only the best episode of the season, but easily one of the best of the series. Sure, it may be a rehash of the In Space episode (again, I can't remember the name, but it's the one with the bee) but it just goes to show how good the writing can be. The scene with the rangers telling Itasis why put themselves in danger to save others gave me shivers. It's really a shame the rest of the season wasn't that good."

ZippityZoppity,changemyview,1391017817.0,"&gt;Privileges of raising a child? The parent already doesn't want to raise the child. There would be no ""privileges"" to give up.

Then they don't get to interact with the child. At all. They can't change their mind years later and decide they want to be a part of their lives. It is a decision that would live them, just like an abortion would. 

You don't think there are pleasures in raising a child, even if it is difficult to do so?

&gt;And the other scenarios I laid out?

Sorry, we're having multiple conversations across the thread, but I know I've replied to these, but here goes again:

&gt;What about when the father can't be found?

This doesn't really change from the current perspective. How can a person that's not located pay child support in the first place? Or do you mean not located before the deadline but found after? I think in the latter, the window still applies - they have a given amount of time to decide if they want to be in the child's life.

&gt;What about when the mother doesn't know she is pregnant?

A window of time from being informed. Let's arbitrarily say 2 weeks for the sake of argument.

&gt;What do you do when the mother lies and says she can't find the father?

Then if the father decides to fight it he has to provide proof that he could be reasonably reached. Obviously, this wouldn't always be the case, but laws are not always perfect. Current laws certainly aren't now, so why are you holding this hypothetical to different standards?"

Yes, I read that too. But it's a hypothetical. He's saying he wants a flat tax rate for all tax brackets (that's a little far... must R's advocate 3 tax brackets, but just less progressive than current rates) and if the poor are only able to pay those taxes with welfare money, then that's how it'll be: they'll pay with the welfare money.

HOWEVER: the title of the article (and this post) say that he wants to raise taxes on poor people ***because*** they can pay with welfare. That is a logical fallacy. Gohmert says that we should have a flat tax rate (this *would* likely raise taxes on the poor, which is why most R's don't advocate it), and as a *result* of that flat tax rate, some of the poor may be forced to pay for their taxes with welfare money. 
Basically, the title is attempting to put Gohmert's conclusion above his main premise. 
Regardless, Gohmert is an idiot for 2 reasons: 

* Flat tax is not a sensible solution at this point in time. While it is ideal, it is not practical or likely in today's political and economic environments.

* MOST taxes (excluding sales and property) come out of income. Welfare income is not taxed. Therefore, those whose only income is welfare would not pay any income, FICA, or SSI taxes. They would NOT be paying a higher effective tax rate than they are currently (since sales and property are regulated by state and county governments, respectively.  There is no federal sales tax...yet.). "

buildmeupbreakmedown,explainlikeimfive,1391017882.0,"&gt; Increased consumption without increased production does mean prices will rise

Only in a 100% eficient economy, but those don't exist. We must account for waste, which is rampant in many industries, especially the food industry because food products spoil very quickly. Take a bakery, for instance: nobody wants to buy stale, day-old bread, so anything produced but not bought by the end of the day will be thrown away. Since consumption varies day to day with some unpredictability, the bakery msut produce enough bread to cover the higher demands, while knowing that this means wasted production on slower days. This habitual waste is a sort of buffer that can absorb a certain amount of the increase demand before production or prices have to increase to match it.

Reduced waste basically means that the entire economy is getting ""something for nothing"", so the benefits accrued by minimum wage workers will not be completely offset by the onus to everybody else. Society as a whole ends up with a net positive outcome."

tricksy_trixie,MakeupAddicts,1391017922.0,"I bought it for my sister for christmas because she likes matte brown shadows but has darker Filipina skin; a lot of the all-matte palettes out there have too many light colors. I'm pretty white and she's tried and hated my Naked Basics and KvD LadyBird, and the new Tarte palette is just out of the question due to how light it is. 

If there were better options for matte palettes with more mid-dark browns, I wouldn't have gotten the Full Exposure palette at all. I bought it knowing that half the shades will not be used by her at all. The glitter shades are crazy glittery and she'll never touch them except for maybe a once in a blue moon night out. Maybe underneath the top layers it isn't as bad, but still. Huge chunks of glitter. 

The quality of the shadows seemed okay to me though. I swatched it in store before I bought it for her and decided that for my light skin and makeup needs (no glitter, limited shimmer) I would never buy this for myself but the matte shades would be good for her. She really likes the palette for the mattes, but then again this is her first non-drugstore makeup so maybe she's not the best judge of mid-range brand quality. The brush seemed only okay to me and I have no idea about the mascara sample that comes with it. 

I guess it depends what you want. If glitter is your thing and you like brown, these do seem like good glitter shadows. Swatched nicely on my hand, at least. But if you are hoping for shimmers rather than glitters and want some color variation, there are better palettes out there for the money. "

Never been a big fan of Aaron Murray. I worry about his durability (even before the injury), and I don't think he does well under pressure, and he doesn't have that great of an arm. He's a well-rounded college QB, but I think that his ceiling isn't that high.

Now, I hate to beat the same drum over and over again, but this is where I like Logan Thomas. He's improving his mechanics, he's poised in the pocket (admittedly, he is a fucking statue in the pocket, but he deals with pressure well), big arm (like Norv would like), and I would love to see him run the option with AP (but that's not the point).

goocy,funny,1391018126.0,"'Meh' is actually quite good for a typical show in its late stages. Usually, season 6 &amp; 7 are unbearable and season 8 is never produced.
This series tried everything and wasn't afraid to break all the rules to not become boring.

They killed off major characters unexpectedly (and permanently). The only thing that was certain was that House wouldn't die (and they even played around with that at the end of season 3). They also had their fun with the ""patient of the day"" paradigm: other locations, other patients, doctors as patients, and even several episodes with no patient at all, just for character development. They touched the most important ethical issues that exist in clinical settings today, and some in academic medicine as well. The patients' sicknesses were mostly realistic (although some of the symptoms were reversed in order). House directed one episode himself, and there was even an episode with a musical.

But what most impressed me was their *consistency*. House pulls especially mean pranks on Wilson? Wilson gets fed up with him for a few episodes. Cuddy wants to become pregnant? Well, coming up next season: difficulties of having a high-powered job and being a single mom. Other shows would have left out this issue, because it's not relevant to the clinical theme. But House took (almost) every minor development, made it permanent and pulled through the consequences.

And I'm saying all of this without even liking any (other) medical-drama TV."

Trying to substitute any type of martial arts instruction from a teacher with something you read in a book, see online, or watch in a video is irresponsible, and frankly, foolish.  There is no way that such a medium can accurately guide you through the depths of your studies the way a teacher can; someone who has already been there themselves, and can push you beyond your own boundaries in a safe, disciplined, and respectful environment.

Additionally, I'm fairly certain this subreddit is not meant to be a Tae Kwon Do manual; that would not be possible in this type of community.  Additionally, the things you're listing are not universal to all of Tae Kwon Do; things like Korean terminology, poomsae charts, techniques, and history will vary not only depending on what branch of Tae Kwon Do you practice, but your individual school.

I'm competitive by nature, in the sense that losing greatly frustrates me, if I'm trying my best. These days I usually play normals with friends, trying out weird/funny/awful/broken builds and just having a fun time. But every time one of these builds finds its way to higher ranked and competitive play (AP Tryndamere and to a much lesser extent AP Shaco) they get, like I said, nerfed into unviability. I understand the importance of this, because it would be a sad thing if people could just cheese their way to victory in competitive play, but the fun in casual play is also lowered as a result. In Dota, Icefrog is never ever going to hurt my Huskar Mage, because it doesn't hold up in competitive play, while it can still be used to some extent in pub games. In LoL, however, when something is nerfed, there's really not an effective way to play it anymore, at all. While I understand this design and balance choice from Riot's standpoint, to me it keeps ruining a lot of the fun I'm having. What they could do, and what they have been repeatedly asked for by the community, is, for example, more custom game options, like instant gold and experience, or giving everyone a fixed movespeed for example, or the classic wtf-mode (no cooldowns, no spell costs) so people can create their own modes in custom games (similar to how ARAM was popular in custom games before an official queue was added).

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1391018200.0,"For me, it was simply recognizing the fact that getting rejected isn't the life-ending horror show you think it is. In fact, it's a good thing. It immediately screens out the women who are not going to be worth any further effort, and it enables you to move on to other prospects. Don't waste time on women who are unavailable.

Also, it's important to recognize that there is by no means a shortage of women out there. Getting rejected by one is nothing. There are plenty of others.

Lastly, it helps cultivate a healthy sense of investment in yourself and your own identity. You have to see value in what you can offer a woman. If you don't have confidence and conviction in your actions, women are going to see right through it. If you approach a woman and you are automatically trying to qualify yourself to her, it's a clear sign that you are far more invested in her opinion of you than your opinion of yourself. That isn't attractive. Fix this before you try approaching anyone."

They also have a high reputation for violence.

Personally, because I'm not suicidal, it's in my self-interest to demand a law that forbids murder. Similarly, it's in the aspiring murderer's self-interest to demand such a law, so he is not killed before he has a chance to commit his acts.

You can't run a legit *full time* photography business, maybe.  But not all of us support ourselves just on photography.  In fact, many of us don't due to fierce competition and maintaining our financial stability during the off seasons.

I charge $800-$1000 for a wedding because I consider photography my side job.  I work full time in an office job and therefore do not do much to market myself, so in order to beat out competition and get that gig (which I THOROUGHLY enjoy and would gladly shoot for that price rather than not at all), I charge that little.  I have professional equipment and a lot of experience shooting in all sorts of settings.  Taxes aren't terrible unless you make over $30k a year.  Of course, I'm no total pro, but [I don't suck all that bad either.](http://imgur.com/a/KjZiw)

mariesoleil,asktransgender,1391018273.0,"&gt;I always assumed descriptors like ""male"" and ""female"" in terms of anatomy were purely scientific.

Language isn't perfect. In English, we don't have adjectives to use for ""man"" and ""woman."" We can't say ""That's a man athlete."" Since ""male"" and ""female"" can also be used as adjectives in addition to nouns, we can use them instead. ""That's a male nurse."" But when we say that, we don't really mean, ""that's a nurse who has XY chromosomes, whose body's development was affected in utero by higher levels of testosterone, who has testicles, a penis, and secondary sex characteristics like facial hair and muscles."" We really mean, ""that's a man who is a nurse.""

""Biological sex"" also isn't something that's as rigidly defined. Are we talking chromosomes, hormone levels, gonads, genitals, secondary sex characteristics? For cis people, those things almost always coincide with their gender. You might think of gender as ""brain sex."" So if gender is in the brain, that's biological too.

So it's important for my doctor to know that I was born male. Sometimes that fact is relevant when diagnosing. A particular pain in my abdomen can't be endometriosis, since I have no uterus. Difficulty in urination could be a problem with my prostate. But for many things, it's relevant that my hormone levels are in female range. If I complain about testicular pain the doctor would take into account that they are shrunken due to hormone replacement therapy, that they don't function in producing sperm. If they treated me as male, they wouldn't be able to diagnose me correctly.

However, people who insist that ""well you're still male"" are transphobic. These are people who know that gender is not the same as sex, but they see sex as more relevant than it is. This is transphobia. They will often say things like, ""I'll call you she but you're still a male, no matter what hormones or surgery,"" and, ""you can't change your chromosomes.""

So that's why I'm female. "

I_RAPE_MY_SLAVES,lewronggeneration,1391018310.0,"My issue with defening is that, for younger defeners at least, it seems like they're trying hard to display that they have good taste. 

In their minds, this is accomplished through A) being contrarian, to indicate they've actively thought about what they are expected to listen to and rejected it (because there's no way to signal you like contemporary music after actively thinking as opposed to mindlessly following it) and B) only picking music that has been approved by generations of critics. They can't risk having bad taste, so they pick the music that everyone has agreed to be good, especially older individuals (who prefer it because they're older and thus more sophisticated, not because they're coinidentally old enough to have listened to it when they were teens). 

A defener can't risk liking a new song or artist because they haven't been vetted by critics. What if you liked a pop song on the radio, but then saw Pitchfork gave it a 2.1? That would mean you had bad taste! No, it's much safer to only listen to the music on Rolling Stone's Top 100 list."

raziphel,AskMen,1391018381.0,"When you are sad, be sad.  When you are happy, be happy.  

I know that sounds trite, but check it:

grief (that heart-wrenching level beyond mere sadness) is part of the process.  you cared about him, he cared about you, but it didn't work and ended.  *It's ok to be sad.*  Yeah, it sucks, but if it didn't hurt, then it wouldn't have really meant anything in the first place.  Emotional pain due to vulnerability isn't a *bad* thing (even though yeah, it fucking sucks), because it gives you emotional depth, and helps you appreciate the *really good* things in life.  The bad times in life don't get better or easier or hurt less, it's just... you're better at handling it because you've practiced.  There will *always* be bad times in life, and though this cannot be avoided, its impact can be lessened with wisdom and effort.

How you handle future grief and loss... well, that's up to you.  Next time, don't bombard the person or be ""that obsessive ex.""  

Therefore: grieve, cry your eyes out into a bucket of haagen das with a friend, then fall asleep on the couch with your favorite comfort object (bear, blanket, pet, whatever), and get it out of your system (which it sounds like you're almost done with).  clean your space, but save a few important mementos, hidden away someplace safe but out of sight.

Then, look back on the good times and smile.  Wish him nothing but the best, whether he deserves it or not, whether it's with you or not.  Why?  **Because you choose to.**  Focus on the positive whenever you can, and this will help you fight the grief and loss when it sneaks back up on you later (when you're in the shower, an empty bed, or whenever).  

Call up some friends and go do something fun tonight.  If you get burned out early (because grief is draining), just skate out early."

And it would also be a major pain in the ass and costly for fans not living in the city to travel to each game.  Figure I'm about 45 min to an hour from Metlife right now and the closest train station is about 20 min from my house. in addition its an hour train ride to penn station ny and $20/25 a ticket each way. then add in getting to the stadium from penn station. and then multiply that by 10 games for regular and pre season and the possibility of post season games. The worst thing for the fans the Jets could have done was move to NYC. And who cares what the Super Bowl would have been like there the odds of a fan going then would be the same as it was this year.

You will find a lot of people here who talk about leaving or going NC had a lot of anxiety over it. Also, a lot of them are not always aware it the better option, or that it even is one. They don't recognize abuse relationships from healthy ones. I have a friend who was shocked when she found out other kids mothers didn't weigh their daughters on a scale every week and ""critique"" their body ""for health reason.""

Even if they do, many people, family and friends included, are unsupportive (in some cases unknowingly) and make comments that make someone trying to leave question that decision. I was dumbfound by how many people did not support me and my partners decision to go NC. I even got argued with, by people who did not even know the circumstance, because apparently circumstance are irrelevant when it comes to blood relation.

lordfuzzywig,CCW,1391018423.0,"This was called the ""FBI method"" and has recently fallen out of favour when shooting, but the fundamental does continue to hold true. When ""searching"", hold the light away from your body. And be prepared and ABLE to shoot this way.

When firing, there are three methods being taught.

* The Harries Method [\(flashlight below gun wrist and wrapped around, supporting firearm-holding wrist\)](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/blackbear11784/crossedwrist.jpg) -- this is very stable and easily done, but it does take a LOT of practice to get used to.

* The [Roger-Surefire Grip](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ICuLB148bJU/TDZaMZKuv_I/AAAAAAAADy4/QVv4ilpEz9c/s400/023.JPG)/[Chapman Grip](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/blackbear11784/chapman.jpg) - holding the flashlight against the grip, or just away from it (much more comfortable than it sounds and specifically designed for small tac-lights -- works wonders.) This is incredibly stable and feels very much like holding the firearm normally. The Chapman grip is for anything larger than a surefire and it works quite well. *NOTE: To turn the surefire on/off, you must use your PALM. Squeeze with your index and middle fingers, flexing them back to your palm to bump the button. Do NOT use your thumb.*

* [The Reverse Harries](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v111/blackbear11784/kevin.jpg). Unstable, but great for quick target acquisition. Uncomfortable, and definitely not my thing, but try all three and try shooting with all three to see what works for you.

With all that said, and your daily Fuzzywig tactics explanation, the following is to OP -- If you feel legitimately like you need to practice low-light shooting and that your most likely engagement will be at night, buy a tactical light for your firearm. You will not regret it, and it will be much more stable and target acquisition at night will feel much more normal to you than any of the above methods.

EDIT/Addition: With the exception of a tactical light on your firearm, you should make every effort to not shine the light directly at the target, but above or below using the light's reflection for greater SA. Do not get boresighted by focusing on the light beam, but the light created by the reflection of the light. Try to get as much light as possible AROUND the room, not ON a specific area. Make sense? :D"

Sorry, that's just what came to mind.  Anyways--your body is the laboratory.  If you're curious about something, try it.  Everyone responds differently, and your results will be individual to you.  

I wouldn't focus so much on arms, but people have different goals.  If you want to see what works, make sure you get empirical.  Take measurements before the 4 week cycle of the new routine, and then measurements after--all under the same controlled conditions. (i.e. day of week, time of day, hydrated/non-hydrated, fasted/non-fasted, etc.)  Go back to your previous routine and do the same.  Compare results."

By the second night I kept the door closed, but slept with my fingers sticking through the holes. I think it took just a few nights like that and he was ok.

It doesn't seem like a big deal now but I was shocked at this revelation at the time.

Have to admit I felt some relief though. Wasn't looking forward to getting measured and weighed because it seems like the people at these kinds of places always have some kind of snippy remark for everything.

Also, makes me tempted to lie just in case I ever want to live a life of crime. TRY FINDING ME WHEN MY HEIGHT IS OFF BY 2 INCHES, SUCKERS!

BitesOverKissing,SwingDancing,1391018696.0,"Advertising is key for new people. A good way to do it is to offer a FREE lesson for people at everything you go to or organize.

Themed events go very well, especially if you open them up to everyone and hold beginner lessons beforehand. Have teachers who are excited to be there, and that they make sure to ask students how they felt about classes (showing it more, showing it less, more or less talking, etc).

Work with the Jazz Band (I assume Nevada has a jazz band as a part of the college?) to host events that benefit you both. Teach a free lesson beforehand and get them interested in dancing &amp; the music at the same time. (These events work the best, since people already like the music, but now have a dance to do to it as well.)

If there's the possibility of travelling a couple hours to other scenes for their events, do it and start a SMALL event on your own campus (one day workshop? couple of cheap dances?)

Make sure to have a website as well, with updated information on the club. Facebook works as well. I assume the University has pages for ""class of 2017"" or whatever, post events/call-outs/anything with beginner info there (once about a week before so they can plan on going, and once the day of to remind everyone). Also, for the call out do a free lesson that you'll largely repeat whenever classes start (people won't get bored doing both, it's all still new and weird learning it the second time.)

Ask organizers in person from scenes within travel distance what they do. Likely regional advice is pretty helpful, and making friends at local scenes will help you get the word out about either club."

poryphria,kpop,1391018699.0,"Well, SKorea is a pretty homogeneous country, so it makes perfect sense that that their beauty standards are narrow.    

The amount of acts I have to sift through to do my bimonthly release lists (and choosing which ones that /r/kpop is more interested in, so the post doesn't become too bloated) is insane- and many of them are not good.  After watching BEAT WIN's debut video this year, I literally facepalmed.  

I think Kiss and Cry is a group that should have debuted a few years ago along with Spica, because right now they're not going to get the attention they deserve.  And they deserve a lot of it; it's not often that a rookie debut song is great.  But this doesn't mean that being an idol is necessarily a good path- in fact, it's a pretty terrible way to make money unless you're fairly popular and can get CF deals and acting parts.  Right now, the rookies who seem to be having success are mostly soloists.

Zygomatico,HomeworkHelp,1391018711.0,"Okay. What you've got is quite interesting, but I think that in the limited space you've got you're trying too much. Each of your questions is an essay in itself, and you probably will not be able to cover all the aspects in that single essay. For example, the (non-)recognition of laws by the Liberian government is probably a Master's Thesis in itself, and trying to divine why they ratified some and not others definitely is too much. The history of the conflict is long. Trying to summarise it in a few paragraphs will cost you around 300-400 words if you want to even portray the basics. If you want to describe conflicts it'll probably take up half your paper. So, long story short: pick one and stick with it.

What I would suggest is choosing one particular law, and look at its effectiveness. The Liberian conflict has been going on for apparently 20 years, so quite a long time. During that time Charles Taylor rose to power and got ousted again, and there probably were lots of other conflicts as well. So there are probably quite a few laws that were instated. I would find one particular law that was made because of a particular conflict, and compare the situations before and after the law. You could even choose one particular country to make it even more specific. Then ask yourself if the law worked as intended. Did the trade stop, or did it merely disappear into the black market? Did the government facilitate the black market? Many Eastern European governments have ties with the criminal circuit, so that could have an influence. So, be more specific.

Finally, once you've got that figured out, dedicate percentages of your paper to specific sections. If you want to use an introduction of 20% of your paper, allocate 800 words to it. Generally each paragraph is between 75 and 125 words, so assume that that will be around 8 paragraphs. Write out each paragraph in a single sentence, your topic sentence. Instead of writing ""Charles Taylor"", write ""As rebel leader in the nineties, Charles Taylor was one of the most important people in the trade of illegal arms"". This indicates you'll be writing about his role in the arms trade. Then, rearrange them to create a good flow - all paragraphs should follow one another logically.

That's all I can say for now. So, narrow down your topic tremendously. Focus on one law, one conflict, one country. Then decide which aspect you want to look at - the effectiveness in the law in stopping trade, in improving the quality of life or the way the government handled it. Allocate paragraphs to each section. Scrap a section if you've got too many, so that you can go in-depth in your topic. 

I hope this was good advice. Good luck on your proposal!"

wordserious,AdviceAnimals,1391018884.0,"I double-majored in Computer Science and Philosophy in the 80s, but dropped out of both for personal reasons. After a couple of successful careers in IT, I decided to go back to school and finally got my BA. I can say that without a doubt, the humanities are harder than STEM. STEM and humanities are hard in different ways, but I will propose that a bright English major can finish any college-level engineering course if he/she decides to do so, while an engineer will have a hard time with most humanities and will probably never be able to finish it - while probably dismissing it as ""soft"" and ""useless.""

People like me (engineers) are usually good at things that have clear methods and structured organization and definite answers.

Full disclosure - I'm horribly biased thanks to my one visit there.  

I like the idea of playing in Mexico, but I dislike that city/stadium choice.  If it is all about reaching the widest Mexican audience (and the $$), then there is no better place in all of Mexico.  But I'd much prefer another location for that game.

An alternative site is hindered further by the fact that no other stadium comes close to the capacity at Estadio Azteca (105,000+).   There are only six other stadiums in the entire country that can host at least 40,000 people.  My choice would be Estadio Jalisco.

&gt;Some of the uses in the new series include: repairing electronic equipment; re-attaching materials such as Barbed Wire; detecting, intercepting and sending signals; remotely operating the TARDIS; burning, cutting, or igniting substances; fusing metal; scanning and identifying substances; amplifying or augmenting sound; modifying mobile phones to enable ""universal roaming”; disabling alien disguises; resonating concrete; reversing teleportation of another entity.

Besides, it's possible that as the educated seize all political power they abuse it to benefit themselves, widening the gap between rich and poor and stifling social mobility.

pizzaandburritos,AskWomen,1391018951.0,"I fantasize about both being in control and having the guy be in control. In reality I'm pretty shy so I usually haven't got the guts to take control. 

I think it's easier to take the reigns when I am really comfortable with the guy, after knowing him for some time. So that side of me only comes out after we have been dating for a while. 

I bet there are women who are more more confident at being aggressive right off the bat, I just don't know how rare it is. You might have better luck with older/more experienced women. Not necessarily cougars, but women who are just a couple years older than you. 

Also, a big part of why some women let the guy lead is because that's just the default expectation. If you let a girl know you like it when a girl takes control, for some women it can be like getting permission to do something fun. They might secretly want to do it and be glad you said something. For others it might sound like a request to do something they're not interested in, but oh well. You might turn off some women but the others that stick around will really be into what you like. 

On the same token, the reason your first sexual experience was with an aggressive girl might have been because she knew you were a virgin. If a guy told me he was a virgin, I would do the same thing. I would just assume that the guy preferred having me take the lead."

Because all they have to do is be good at sports to get it...you don't have to be smart like the kids who get academic scholarships and deserve them.  We bring in dumb athletes that fill spots that could have been taken by kids who want to learn.    College is still a school after all, not the Olympic program.  

&gt;More than half the student body, if not more for top tier schools, will never touch a tuition bill. And your argument that they should be happy living on the knife edge because other people have it worse is an argument for diminishing returns  

They will almost all, except for those paid for and on scholarship, have student loans however which is just a payment plan for  tuition bill.  Moot point.  

&gt;I don't give a shit if you buy it or not.  

Proof you are full of shit, hows flipping burgers and masquerading as someone who makes $300K a year working out for you?

I agree, I don't use my History Degree either for what I do.  I studied what I enjoyed, worked my way through school and took a couple extra years because of my work schedule, then I got into something where I can make a lot of money for myself if I work hard at it.  

If you really do own your own company then I applaud you for creating work.  Thank you for being a job creator, we need more of you.  I just started my company, it is a small agency and I am the only employee right now.  

If it's any consolation, apologies for ripping on you when I don't actually know your story, it's just too easy sometimes.

Now that we're here, however, it's probably time to recognize that the patriarchy confines men into unreasonably strict and narrow gender roles as well.

Bestbtrollin,bodybuilding,1391019340.0,"I seem to be one of the few people around these subreddits that is actually in the process of losing fat, but still lifts often and heavy.

The main thing i take away from this is that by losing fat, you will not lose any muscle at all provided that you lift regularly and keep up your protein. So if you can't lose it, you can only really gain or maintain. I lifted for 2 years in highschool (currently 21) got decently strong like 225 1rm on bench. Been lifting again for about 5 month on often a 500kcal+ deficit and my 1rm is about 250 and all of my lifts have been going up. I think it's noob gains and just sort of getting back what I lost. I figure I will make gains on a caloric deficit but it will be really slow. I'm not risking lean gains because it would slow my weight loss way too much.

Started at 330, currently 250 @ 6'2.

I would agree with your tl;dr, but chances are if you're already lean then you're just sabotaging your gains by fucking around and if you're fat, you're sabotaging your fat loss by eating a caloric surplus."

Using a fired case (or actually slightly-flared, if you have access to reloading equipment, since even a fired case has a smaller diameter than the chamber -- the expansion due to firing is only temporary), pushed in the cylinder from the breech end as normal, will scrape out the carbon ring.

ijustlovemath,learnmath,1391019538.0,"sin(A+B) = sinAcosB + sinBcosA

Use A = theta, B = arctan(b/a), let Q = sqrt(a^2 + b^(2))

acos(t) = sqrt(a^2 + b^(2))sin(t+atan(b/a)) + bsin(t)

acos(t) = Q sin(t) cos(atan(b/a)) + Qsin(atan(b/a))cos(t) + b sin(t)

cos(t) (a- Q sin(atan(b/a)) = sin(t)(Qcos(atan(b/a)) +b)

Now, to simplify those nasty arctan, we need to draw a picture:

http://i.imgur.com/NDJiCES.png

In this picture, we're using a different t than we have been. no relation to the current t. In fact, when referring to the t in the picture, i'll just call it T. Big T!

Okay, so what is the arctan? it's the ANGLE whose tangent is the argument. so, since tan(T) = b/a, we know that arctan(b/a) = T (in the picture). Awesome. How does this help us? It lets us draw nifty pictures like the one I just drew. Because we're working on a right triangle, we can solve for the remaining side, and wouldn't ya know it, it's Q! that's amazing!

Now, we gotta return to the definition of sin and cosine to simplify the equation any further. by definition, sin(T) = b/Q, and cos(T) = a/Q (remember SOH CAH TOA?).

Awesome. Now we've got everything we need to finish this.

cos(t) (a- Q sin(atan(b/a)) = sin(t)(Qcos(atan(b/a)) +b)

(a- Q sin(atan(b/a))/(Qcos(atan(b/a)) +b)= tan(t)

let's find out what (a- Q sin(atan(b/a)) is.

since we've established (just by drawing a picture) that atan(b/a)=T, we simplify this to: a - Q sin(T). but wait! sin(T) = b/Q!

so this bit simplifies to: a-Qb/Q = a-b.

For the next part, Qcos(atan(b/a)) +b), we'll do the same thing.

QcosT = Qa/Q = a, so Qcos(atan(b/a)) +b) = a+b

therefore, tan(t) = (a-b)/(a+b), and t = atan((a-b)/(a+b))."

Nice boots allow you to put a new sole on the boot for a small cost.  So instead of spending $60 to replace your boots every year you can spend $20 to resole them.

Furthermore I don't see how your proposal would help out on this front because when one of your bounty hunters runs into one of these gang-bangers and says ""I think you're here illegally, it's time to take you in"" he or she is going to get shot and buried some place where the police will never find them.

If your proposal is targeting these gangs, cartels and other organized groups, by giving the go ahead to bounty hunters, you're essentially giving a state sanction to an all out gang war. Your bounty hunters would get shot when they tried to bring the bad guys in, so the only way they could defend themselves would be with guns of their own and as we've already covered since this proposal would inevitably lead to racial profiling, how long would it be until an innocent Hispanic man gets shot by a racist bounty hunter just because he was in the wrong place at the wrong time?"

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391019683.0,"&gt; It is extremely difficult for one entity to acquire so much property peacefully.

1) Who says it needs to be acquired peacefully? Why should they care about rules with no enforcement?

2) It's a hypothethical.

&gt;2. The management of such a large amount of property/capital peacefully would require hiring assistance to help manage it. These managers would need to be educated and knowledgable about the property and would be paid more than regular workers.

Ok, so you would create a small number of elites. Ok, go on, starting to look like a feudal system here.

&gt; 3. This scenario ignores human creativity, drive, and intelligence.

Which I fail to see how it enters the equation.

&gt;If this scenario occurs, not all the workers will be satisfied to take 'unfair pay'. 

They don't need to be satisfied. They can take it or screw off and starve?

&gt;They will start their own businesses, invent new things, move somewhere else, invest labor into other things not already owned to create valuable things that they can then trade with.

How? If they have no property, no education, and nowhere to go?

&gt; 4. This scenario ignores consumer tastes. If this ""monster monopoly"" is really as despicable as you say, many people will not want to trade with it. People will resent their greed and will prefer to trade with others.

Just like how no one shops at wal mart right? Or how no one buys apple products, right?

&gt; 5. This scenario ignores charity and compassion. Why do you think the people on top in this scenario are absolutely heartless?

Because this is what's happening now. he system rewards sociopathy. I've heard it said when the pope criticized capitalism recently that he doesn't know what he's talking about because economics are amoral. The system is amoral, and it not only allowed, but encourages and rewards amorality and exploitation.

&gt;While you and I believe this ""monster monopoly"" scenario is immoral, I must admit that this is subjective. If you do not believe in a unified moral theory, how can you prove that this scenario is actually objectively immoral and that therefore you should take people's property against their will in order to prevent it

Because I still believe in maximizing pleasurable occurrances, but minimizing painful or unpleasant ones. 

&gt;how can you prove that this scenario is actually objectively immoral and that therefore you should take people's property against their will in order to prevent it?

because it leads to human suffering and there are better alternatives, good enough for me. I believe that first and foremost, life and the human experience trump property rights, because these are the goals and imperatives for morality. Just because I dont believe in a unified moral theory does not make me amoral. It just makes me much more responsive to conditions to advocate for moral change. Complex frameworks don't do this. They actually JUSTIFY human suffering because stopping it violates their sense of morality. This is why I have a strong distaste for this obsession with property rights. Do you think I really care about property rights much when people are suffering? ""I'm sorry Tiny Tim, you can't have your operation because Eboneezer Scrooge's property rights are more important than your survival."" Sorry, but human property is a social construct meant to increase human prosperity, and enhance one's life. It's only as useful insofar that it does its job and when it actually leads to suffering in a scenario when such suffering is not actually necessary, it becomes dysfunctional and needs to be addressed.

&gt;Someone else might say that this scenario is good because all of the property is in the possession of the ""most equipped"" to put it to good use. 

And I'd disagree, because clearly if I can think of ways to put it to better use and achieve more utilitarian results, they're clearly not doing their job. Heck, I would consider such a system more tyrannical than the state you rail against.

&gt;but how can you say that your subjective opinion is more valid than their subjective opinion (if you accept no unified moral theory) and force them to submit to yours? 

Leads to increased human pleasure and decreased human suffering."

tallavery,Dogtraining,1391019804.0,"I had trouble until I taught him the ""speak"" command. He really hates doing it, so much of the time it comes out as a quiet growl a few times before he'll actually bark. I guess this is where the whisper started.

My desk is situated within arm's reach of the back door, so when he needed to go out, he'd stand there and wait. I told him to speak, and as usual, he'd utter a few of the growls first. I realized I liked that better than a disruptive bark, so I'd open the door as soon as he growled. In the beginning it seemed like I was opening the door every five minutes, but every time I'd encourage him to go potty and call him in if it didn't happen. Also, I figured that if he'd just gone there was no need to go again for a while. I played a dangerous game there for a week or so, waiting until I could sense clear urgency (*panting and pacing) on his part before I'd open the door. He figured it out.

For the most part, he doesn't ask to go out now unless he really needs to pee. All bets are off if he suspects there may be a critter out there that needs evicting, so even now there are times he asks to be let out just to investigate. Fine by me ... at least he's not bothering me every few minutes. Also, my door is scratch-free.

EDIT: Also, and I don't know what a real trainer would say about this, but my house has three exit doors. I taught my dog that each door was for a different thing. Back door is for potty, kitchen door is for when we go to the car, and front door is used for daily walks.

The logo is almost unnoticeably lower than the casing, I thought about doing that, but the blade is ever so sharp and I would hate myself if I scratched my laptop

my initial plan was to draw over the apple with tracing paper, use a pencil to emboss the logo onto the sticker, and then cut the apple out and stick it on the laptop.

the way deadmau5 did it was he stuck the stickers on and then cut them out using an x-acto knife, I am not that brave though

This may be true. It's possible her actions are a symptom of the relationship breakdown. But every person is responsible for their own actions, no matter the circumstance. In this case, he would be 100% responsible for his role as the catalyst in their relationship troubles. Extended, he is responsible for the fact his actions caused other people unnecessary strife (even if there were other factors at play).

It's possible that strife would have happened anyway. It's possible that, if he doesn't respond to his advances, then she will simply cheat with someone else. But the most important point I can make is that *you have a responsibility for yourself*. Just because a painful/immoral course of action may be inevitable, it doesn't mean *you* have to contribute. You can't control others, but you can control yourself.

I think it's important to do the best you can to do the right thing, even in crap situations. You don't have to live with other's decisions, you have to live with yours. Your actions matter. Your choices matter. To hell with the rest.

We continued hanging out and sleeping together while they were ""exclusive"" and they broke up/made up several times over the summer all the while we continued sleeping together. Eventually, this past December she realized she was being a shitty person to her supposed boyfriend and we stopped. For the best as it really wasn't helping me get over her... Not that I wanted to at that point. As far as I know he has no idea this was happening and she's managed to re-invent herself to him as a good person because of that. Lies and subterfuge. 

So say you're in his shoes... How do you think you'd feel if/when you found out? Granted this is a specific scenario but easily applicable to what could come of yours.

TL;DR: woman cheats, shacks up with other guy, cheats on other guy for a year, other guy oblivious. You want be other guy? No.

Chgr,TheRedPill,1391020001.0,"I would strongly disagree.

I mean, everything you said separately *is* true. It's just there's no link between those.

Women find nice guys as lacking in self confidence, as those who respect them way too much and lack the strong, hot, dominant masculinity, because if they *were* like that, they wouldn't repress those traits for any reason, and as nice guys don't display such behavior, women automatically assume that those guys therefore have nothing to display, anyway. So a nice guy (in their eyes) - weak, whining, boring, too respectful, predictable, non-challenging person.

There's also the thing with women that they like to, and *do* crush those who allow them to, by not being man enough.

So, *that's why* they don't like, or seemingly despise nice guys.

Trust me, they are aware that being nice to get things or get out of unpleasant situations (also called - vaginal manipulation, if aimed towards men) is a women's tool, they don't confuse it the way you are suggesting."

View [top posts here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/top/) and you'll see that 88 of the top 100 are images. Mostly skyline stuff. A few stupid memes, a picture of a terrible pizza.... there are some unique and interesting pics in there, don't get me wrong, but there's also a lot of total crap.

On the flip side:

Sort by [Controversial](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicago/controversial/?sort=controversial&amp;t=week) from the past week (since today there seems to be a big uptick in upvotes thanks to this post) and you'll find the following articles I consider ""discussions that are actually interesting or critical"" that you say get upvotes...

Yes, I'm ignoring lots of posts that are crap and got downvotes, because we can agree they probably should have. But here's just a smattering from the first couple/few pages that are near-zero or in the negatives...

- Hey r/chicago, my band is coming to the Beat Kitchen in a couple weeks, what's the best way to get the word out? (self.chicago) -- maybe not the best example, this one's debatable, but ""how should bands promote themselves in Chicago"" isn't an easy question to answer, maybe community input would be useful. 

- What do I need to do to legally own a gun in Chicago? (self.chicago)  -- yes, it's google-able and a controversial topic, I'll grant you that.

- Moving to Lakeview/Roscoe/Wrigleyville area this spring/summer and had some questions... (self.chicago) -- this guy has unique questions, but it is +9/-8.

- Secret audit found city speed cameras had high error rates in Baltimore. How does this affect the speed cameras in Chicago? (articles.baltimoresun.com) -- relevant to Chicago's interests

- Bike stolen from my Logan Square garage. (Near Palmer and Kimball) (self.chicago) -- maybe more appropriate for EB? Still, it's community relevant info and keeping people on the lookout is a bad thing how?

- NATO 3 Undercover Officer on Making Molotov Cocktails: 'Let's Do It' - Bridgeport (dnainfo.com) -- not obvious from title, but this happened in Chicago...

- How to protect your shoes from snow and salt (my personal method is to just wear some shitty shoes during the mucky days) (chicagomag.com) - honestly, why so many downvotes on this? we're all encountering a lot of snow/salt... hrm.

- Free Tax Help: Chicago to Assist Low-Income Families at 20 Locations (dnainfo.com) -- this would've been useful to some people who might've seen it... it's not spam, it's an article about free help for low income families.

- Are there any Chinese restaurants in Chicago that serve Dim Sum outside of just weekend mornings and afternoons? (self.chicago) - that's a pretty specific question that the sidebar isn't gonna answer.

- I Didn't Realize So Many 'Delicatessens' Have Closed (chicagobusiness.com) -- interesting fact I didn't know.. why the downvotes?

- This weather is killing my gas bill (self.chicago) -- how the heck does this get 31 upvotes? it deserved the 22 downvotes... the selftext content contains ""for real"". that's it.

- CPS closed tomorrow 1/28/14 as well. (suntimes.com) -- this is informational. +15/-12. Why -12?

- Repost /r/news: Baltimore City had a secret audit on their speed cameras and found $2.8 million should be returned. (baltimoresun.com) -- yes, another was posted, but both got downvoted a ton, so ""it was a repost"" isn't an argument. why downvote this so much? This is valid to chicago's interests.

- University student, looking for information on when Chicago neighborhoods started integrating (self.chicago) - google-able? maybe... but hardly a question we get often here.

- How Chicagoans Commute (transitized.com) - pretty interesting infographics / information here... +8/-5.. 

- Unique and cheap Valentine's day ideas? First V-day in the city! (self.chicago) -- yeah, we're all sick of people asking for ""help"" finding stuff.. but who better to ask than people who live here? this isn't a question the sidebar answers and some interesting ideas were shared. This post is in the negatives though, so less ideas were shared than could have been.



that's just a few, and that's just over the past week - which I can already tell is slanted a bit just by today's upvoting changes (likely thanks to this post) which I hope stay in place....

TONS of very specific, non-sidebar questions get asked and voted to the negatives here... 

Would it help if we had AutoModerator tag questions as such so people who hate them could more easily ignore them or something?  

I'm not looking to set ""rules"" here, I'm looking to understand what people actually want and how we might be able to facilitate that."

Stryc9,worstof,1391020051.0,"Wow, that is a profoundly fucked up way of thinking, and would produce some ridiculously perverse public policy. I am glad you are not in charge of that kind of thing.

On one hand, I agree with you in a sense that the punishment for crimes should absolutely not be outcome dependent but I come to a completely different conclusion than you. Let's pursue your line of thinking a little bit. Under your reasoning, attempted murder should be legal as long as the offender fucked it up so badly that (s)he didn't actually hurt anyone. I think it is criminally stupid to wait until people are actually hurt or killed to curtail dangerous behavior.

The conclusion that I come to is that Attempted Murder and Murder ought to be punished exactly the same because the intent to do harm was the same in each person's head. Same thing with DWI and Manslaughter. While the outcome may not of been bad this time, you are doing something incredibly dangerous that very well could get someone killed (and very regularly does).

Just because there was not a violent or bad outcome in this instance doesn't mean that society doesn't have an interest in curtailing that behavior."

CaspianX2,AskMen,1391020072.0,"Okay, I'm gonna' run against the flow of the general sentiment I seem to be sensing here.

I feel like it's only natural to have some good feelings towards an ex. After all, you were with them for a reason, right? And those good feelings don't really die, they just fade with time.

The issue here seems to be multifold:

1. Where does he see her and himself moving forward? Does he *want* to be back with her? If she asked him, would he say yes?

2. How appropriate is it for him to go on about her to you?

For 1, I highly recommend the two of you sitting down and having a serious talk about what he wants. You need to know (and he needs to know) what he'll do if she wants to restart things with him.

For 2, I think that honesty is better than hiding things. However, he should still be respectful of your feelings so, again, discuss this and how it makes you feel."

We have A stagnant economy which is causing a boom for the wealthy, but is digging the poorer people into a deeper and deeper hole to the point we almost have no ""middle class.""

Wages here are stagnant. In 1959 minimum wage was equal to $10 hourly. Now people on minimum wage are only making $7.25. Not to mention it is near impossible to find full time work, at least where I am. The only full time work I can find is for 2-3 months out of the year as ""seasonal"".

There are valid reasons for being overweight, and I'd like to not be judged for something largely outside my control, but some people do just use it as an excuse and I accept it can be hard to tell the difference.

That is the equivalent of what a modern day, decently attractive woman experiences, so it's not a mystery as to why they think they are gods gift to men.

On the other hand though, being aware of this modern day phenomenon can put a man a step ahead of the competition, so it is essential to understand, accept, and calibrate accordingly in order to attain the ultimate goal.

I'm saying if you got rid of the state all markets would likely become violent.

&gt;Standardization is how market sectors work. There's a reason why laptop keyboard layouts are roughly the same. You're making absolutist claims about a nuanced area of economics.

You're the one who wants different standards for different people based on choice and ability to pay, not me.

&gt;Economically-stunted democratic majorities everywhere are in favor of 'socialized' law-enforcement. What makes you think that a stateless society with much more wealth wont express those same desires in even more efficient and direct ways?

You know, Rome tried the whole private body guard thing before. I saw this on the history channel. It led to more violence so they had to have police come in and keep order.

&gt;Getting rid of the state will not suddenly make people no longer care about police being provided for those who can't afford it.

it would also make it much harder, and open up the flood gates for an even more tyrannical entity to come on.

&gt;A state only adds an extra layer of bureaucracy and corruptible-monopoly

As if monopolies don't exist without states? How do you think states formed to begin with? Normally through eliminating the competition.

&gt;Opening up the market will create an environment more ripe for technological advancements in defense technologies

How, if you decentralize everything?

&gt; give people more free-time for volunteering, more spending cash for donations, and higher wages. 

No. Just no. It leads to exploitation.

&gt;I don't know which dystopian political science classroom you've been in, maybe you just had a bad acid trip while watching Mad Max?

And I dont know what utopia world you live in, but it's not reality based on history and human nature. Just because you ignore everything that can go wrong doesn't mean that they still aren't problems.

&gt;Also, you're ignoring the private protection agencies (that exist where the state monopoly has eased up/broken) , such as Detroit Threat Management, that already protect entire neighborhoods even if it only has a few subscribers, because that's what gives it the competitive edge.

Such agencies work WITH the police if I'm not mistaken, not on their own volition by their own rules. They're still responsible to the law. They wouldnt be if you got rid of the state."

Your vocal talent is great as well, and you've inspired me to keep an open mind towards practicing and developing my own voice for whatever may occur in the future; again, thank you for all the awesome inspiration and impact you've had on me.

My question, then, is as follows: While I understand that Game Grumps is an enormous project, and you have so many obligations that require your time, will you be doing more animations? From what I understand, the Starbomb animation you did for Luigi's Ballad took you a long time, but it was fantastic. I really enjoy the shorts you animated on Newgrounds and on your egoraptor YouTube channel, and I have been faithfully checking in for news on the status of your animation channel for a while now. I think the last one you did was ""Console vs. PC,"" and that was over 9 months ago.

Sketchy_Uncle,dayz,1391020375.0,"As someone that was really into the first person shooter and other more fast paced combat games, this was a big change.  I noticed that now I cared a lot more all of the sudden.  I guess this fits well into what the developers wanted with the concept of ""permanent death""/or total loss of your character, gear and other items.  The suspense for me lays in the idea that you never really know where you will be forced to go for resources, who you will encounter, and how they will perceive you.  Are you competition for resources in their eyes? probably...are you an easy target?, worth the risk?  The other half of the game that makes you 'think' is the risk to benefit ratio.  Where you have a character that is 'valuable', you now have to weigh many more consequences to your actions.  Will it make too much noise and attract zombies?, Will I have enough food or water to travel x-number of km?  Will entering this notoriously busy area cause an unfavorable encounter with another survivor?  Will the risks to all those behaviors have a pay out of some kind?  Most likely, but not always.  The concept of value of the character has transformed the player into a more cautious and careful entity whereas the FPS/fast paced shooter is disposable and merely concerned with attacking the other side and wearing down their numbers in a set time limit or point count.  This is different, its survival, its risk to benefit ratio calculations and valuing what your hard earned time/character can scavenge in the post apocalyptic world."

&gt; we should not rush in headlong and so firmly take our stand on one side that, if further progress in the search of truth justly undermines this position, we too fall with it. That would be to battle not for the teaching of Holy Scripture but for our own, wishing its teaching to conform to ours, whereas we ought to wish ours to conform to that of Sacred Scripture

 

&gt;Usually, even a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other elements of this world, about the motion and orbit of the stars and even their size and relative positions, about the predictable eclipses of the sun and moon, the cycles of the years and seasons, about the kinds of animals, shrubs, stones, and so forth, and this knowledge he holds to as being certain from reason and experience. Now, it is a disgraceful and dangerous thing for an infidel to hear a Christian, presumably giving the meaning of Holy Scripture, talking nonsense on these topics; and we should take all means to prevent such an embarrassing situation, in which people show up vast ignorance in a Christian and laugh it to scorn. The shame is not so much that an ignorant individual is derided, but that people outside the household of the faith think our sacred writers held such opinions, and, to the great loss of those for whose salvation we toil, the writers of our Scripture are criticized and rejected as unlearned men.... Reckless and incompetent expounders of Holy Scripture bring untold trouble and sorrow on their wiser brethren when they are caught in one of their mischievous false opinions and are taken to task by these who are not bound by the authority of our sacred books"

‘If we did not start with the list prices we have, we would not end up with enough revenue to remain in operation… Our costs for providing uncompensated care are partially covered by higher bills for other patients.*

I'm not saying everyone should be held by the promise 2 people make in a relationship.

And in this case, with OP's awareness and full knowledge of the situation, it would be immoral for OP to contribute to the infidelity.

&gt;If she'll cheat with OP, she'll cheat with anyone.

Maybe that's true. But *it doesnt have to be with him*. You are always responsible for what you do. No matter how awful other people are. No matter how shitty the situation to begin with. 

Yes, she should blamed for *her* actions. She's not a blameless party. But, assuming he were to go along with the cheating, then he wouldn't be blameless either.

In this case, he's fully aware of the consequences of his actions (causing pain to another, enabling dishonesty, etc.) If he chooses to act immorally anyway, he should absolutely be held responsible for those actions. 

I don't think this is what you're saying, but it would be illogical to say ""well, she's a bitch so everything I do is her fault"".

If you don't want to stay depressed, and if therapy and lifestyle change have not helped you, it may be wise to consider using medicine. The medicine is not an excuse for you to be happy; it is merely a means for you to rediscover what it's like to not be depressed. The moment you feel worse on it, talk to your psychiatrist and STOP. The moment you feel like you want to kill yourself, TALK TO SOMEONE. You are in control of your life; anti-depressants aren't completely mind- and mood-altering like PCP or bath salts.
