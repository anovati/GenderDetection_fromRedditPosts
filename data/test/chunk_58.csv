funkymunniez,nfl,1390173719.0,"Uhhh, we've had no pass rush for something like 8 weeks now and that has *very* little to do with coaching and everything to do with out Dline being composed of Free Agents who otherwise probably wouldn't have had a job this year.

And stop pretending our injuries today didn't hurt us.  When Talib went out, we were completely mismatched on the receivers.  Dennard on D. Thomas? Are you kidding me?  That was Talib's assignment.  No wonder he torched us.

If you want to try and blame the coaching, go back and find a recording of this game. We had tons of schemes and calls that matched the Broncos play call perfectly but were blown because of our players not performing.  The coaching was fine."
TechnoSam_Belpois,AdviceAnimals,1390173720.0,"Because the battery is bad. It has a certain amount of charge left, which is normally 10% of the capacity, so the device reports 10%. The battery is much weaker, so that charge is going down so fast, the phone doesn't update to display the new percentage.

The phone will ask for less updates on battery info, so that way the battery will last as long as possible. With a weak battery, it's going to die before it has that chance.

If you watch it long enough, you can still see it display that 1% occasionally, if you get a bit lucky."

Beastafer,Patriots,1390173774.0,"No one can replace Big Vince. That's just a given.

If we can get a DT in the 3-5th rounds then we can effectively install a dominate 4-3 defense with 2 hard DTs that will let Spikes and Mayo get the RB while the DTs can take up to 3 offensive linemen out of the equation. 

I would argue though that because they were able to pass so effectively we couldn't stop the run (remember: pass opens up the run, and the run opens up the pass) so if we can make sure they can't pass well then we'll cut down on what we could give up to any defense.

Regardless: Today sucked. We hard our flaws thrown in our faces. Our Dark Lord will make sure we'll be better fitted next year, but after all our injuries on defense I can stand proud in the face of defeat.

screenmagnet,sex,1390173951.0,"I'm just going off what my bf told me. He said that he could probably stay hard if an ugly girl sucked him off. But if he knew that a dude was sucking him off (even if he was blindfolded) the psychological turn off would be so strong that he would lose his erection, no matter how good the sensations felt.

I believe him, because my bf's sexual arousal seems to be quite psychological vs physical. E.g. Porn won't usually get him hard, but 2 mins of sweet talking while cuddling will do it, as will dirty sexts that play into his imagination. And if I mention something upsetting during sex, he will lose his erection immediately. Most guys I have been with have been this way. Their arousal is all in their head. And they have all been so viscerally turned off by dicks, that I believe they literally wouldn't be able to keep it up during a blow job from a man. My first bf was so turned off by penis that he couldn't cum when watching straight porn. So he only whacked it to lesbian porn or solo girl porn. And current bf is so turned off by peen that the dildos we use for pegging can't have balls or otherwise look too realistic, because if I look like I have an actual penis between my legs, he will go soft.

I just asked my bf how he would define male heterosexuality, and he said 'viscerally turned off by the sight or thought of the male body, especially the penis'. He says if he felt neutral or selectively turned on by men or penis, he would consider himself bi.

And yeah, we are in our 20s. But all the guys I have dated were late bloomers or went through prolonged dry spells. But they all preferred loneliness and sexual frustration over casual sex with a man. My bf says he would rather be celibate for the rest of his life than have sex with a man."

1) Obviously NHS and pension payouts are bigger as more people both pay into and use them.

3) The EU is a lot more complicated than you realise and many MANY economist believe it's best for us to start spearating ourselves from it. (I can provide sources if you want.)

4) The left don't do anything because the people don't want them to do anything. In the end democracy is simply winning the minds of a largely uninformed mob, and the mob see's immigration as a key issue(largely because media hype) therefore the left simply cater to the mobs desires.

Dude, this is the **exact opposite of the truth**.

The stereotype that people who trust freely are ""wimps"" is just bullshit made up by people who are actually too cowardly to take a risk and put themselves out there.

**You are the strong one**. You are the smart one. Not the closed-off dudebros who put you down for getting burned. There's no risk without reward, and unless you're ignoring flagrant red flags, there's nothing shameful about taking risks on other people.

Nothing in your story sounds ""weak"", naive, or wimpy to me. It sounds like you took all of the requisite safeguards (including looking up her pictures online) and still ended up getting hurt. Well, you know what? That sounds like real life to me. You can still get into a car accident and die even if you only drive in the slow lane with your seatbelt on.

If anyone says garbage like ""you're an idiot for trusting a random person online"", they are actually telling you ""I'm too afraid to try something like that myself; I'd rather languish in familiar misery and feel better about myself by insulting people who dare imagine something more"".

Never ever let someone put you down for taking a calculated risk. Good investors don't stop investing when they lose money on the stock market; nor should you stop forging new connections with people just because you got hurt. Listen to yourself, pay attention to your level of energy and situation in life, and go for broke.

Getting hurt doesn't make you weak; learning lessons and standing back up again will make you strong."

Do you and your friends not consider that;

Some men lack the confidence to ask girls out? 

Or that some men don't want to conform to this norm?

In my past - I regret doing it now because they were attractive - 2 women (on 2 separate occasions) approached me and began flirting. When it was time for them to leave they signaled (by repeating themselves and NVC) that they would like me to ask them for their number. I was annoyed because I interpreted it as them not being willing to risk rejection, and so I bid them farewell.

PS. Regarding the wage gap have you seen this?

If all the snipers had the same acceleration due to gravity, the M98B would come out on top again because it has the highest bullet velocity and the M40A5 would have the most drop due to its slow bullets.

For the copyright issue, this is a straightforward Fair Use case.

1. The Purpose and the Character of the Use: it is transformative, and promotes the interests of all parties involved. It almost certainly wouldn't be called commercial--unless *any* non-private use would be called commercial.
2. Nature of the copyrighted work: It is numeric data. It is not near the core of copyright, or for any other reason particularly important to protect.
3. Amount and Substantiality of the Infringed Work: Granted, all. Still, this factor won't weigh as heavily as 1. and 4.
4. Effect on the market for the original work: There is no market for the original work. Yale is not licensing its course reviews for money or any other benefit. And, again, if anything, this makes the data more valuable as it is available in more forms, now--to all.

ArcherofArchet,AdviceAnimals,1390174323.0,"Honestly, skipping a year or two before college may not be a bad idea.  I went straight to college after HS (although in a different country with a very different college system), and I had no idea what I wanted to do.  I went for a semi-appealing major, and found out that although I hated it, and I had no intentions of ever working in the field, I was kind of stuck.  I would have had to start from zero again to change majors.

I ended up leaving that school in my junior year, when I moved to the States.  I didn't go back to school until some three years later, after having worked two insanely shitty jobs.  For one thing, it made me appreciate school and a good job much better.  For another, I made damned sure I didn't go back to school and start drawing on grants/loans until I knew what I was doing.

I do think that (with some exceptions) most people could benefit from a year or two at a McJob before hitting college.  Bonus points if you do this while living on your own, paying rent, keeping the power on, and affording the luxury of high-speed internet and Netflix, but excluding the luxuries of cable or cell phones (landlines, yo!)."

Oh no, CB Harris didn't play today...Champ Baily and DRC now have to cover...Edleman and that's it.  We lost Talib and his assignment went to Dennard who was horribly mismatched on D. Thomas.  His assignments got shifted around and we ended up completely losing track of J. Thomas in the process.  We also ended up leaving Arrington to cover Welker on the outside now which sucked because he frequently over ran where the pass was going.

It's easy to say that the Broncos D had injuries too but the only real weapon they had to worry about was Edleman.

Again, we had a lot of great calls from the coaches on schemes and counters but there was no way that our remaining personnel were going to contain Welker, Thomas^2, Decker, Moreno, and Tamme.  We weren't out coached, we were just simply outplayed by a superior set of personnel on the other side of the ball."

&gt;Am I wrong in thinking that all battery housings are the same (not discerning if they are VV or VW)? 

Yes

&gt;Why would you need to get and MVP and then an MVP2 and then a ProVari and then an SVD if you're using the same tank on them?

That's not the ideal order, but each one is different enough to be an upgrade.  The MVP and MVP2 have built in batteries, and the MVP is VV while the MVP2 is VV/VW.

Then the SVD is. different form factor and a different chip.  It has the infamous 33 Hz chip that causes a ""rattlesnake"" sound, and has VV and VW.  It's a telescopic tube that allows you to use any batteries from 18350 to 18650.

Then the Provari is a tank, built to last.  It has better electronics than the SVD, so better power to the atty... But it doesn't come with the ability to run different sized batteries without additional purchases.  And it doesn't have a VW mode.  And of course you can buy an MVP, MVP2, and an SVD and take your wife out to dinner for the price of the Provari.

It is easy to get bitter when you know you are a good person and all this shit is happening around you. People, men and women, are dicks, especially when it comes to dating. When you are dating, the attitude is no one owes you anything. You can take me out on multiple dates, you can fuck each other, you can make declarations about how we feel, but they don't owe you anything and they can just disappear into thin air and just leave you in shambles.

You open yourself up to these people, make yourself vulnerable, give it your all, but in the end, you don't know them. They tell you they want you and likes you, they fuck you over and then they leave you. How can anyone not be bitter after that happens to them?

And then you see these happy couples. Your friends and family all telling you the right person will come along. What the fuck do they know? They don't know what you are going through. By some miracle on this planet they found someone. But do they even really know this person? Are they with them because they want to be and they love them or are they just with them because they want to be and not be alone. But it doesn't matter what you think, because you are the single person who doesn't know how to connect with people. You need to buck up and keep trying. You are the one with problems because you are just looking to find someone who you to want and to love and just feels the same way about you.

I'm really sorry. Dating puts you through the ringer. You begin to think ""what is wrong with me"" and then ""what the fuck is wrong with everyone else."" It is lonely. But it isn't an entire gender that does this. It is dating. It is trying to find someone. You can't unilaterally blame half the population for you being alone. That's not fair to them or to you.

End tirade.

Everything you said rings true for people who have been single for a while, male or female, and continue to date and attempt to put themselves out there. I can't give any good advice because I'm in the same position. But I don't blame men. The ones who have put me through this clearly aren't right for me. You aren't alone in feeling this. I don't know how much comfort that provides, but not everyone is a douche.

When they see an upcoming male student, they could see themselves in that student.  

They may not have ever been familiar with women in these roles.  

So their interactions with students can be colored by these subconscious beliefs. 

It can be as basic as using sports examples in class. 

Look at the comments from 19-25 yr old guys in this thread and how many are: ""Women aren't interested in science""  ""They drop out because it's hard""  ""They rather work in HR.""  These are part of the modern generation.  That just indicates there is probably a scary amount of *blatant* bias.

Take a team with 3 massive 7 footers on the floor and they'd get beat. That's why teams don't already do this!

I worked at the IT Helpdesk on my college campus, and interned for one small (35 employees), local company four times. I'm still working for them now. I think you're doing a good job by learning a diverse set of languages and platforms (ObjC, Scripting, Web) and interning at a number of diverse companies (especially Apple).

When I look for a new job my resume will have a lot of roles at one small company in a niche market no one's familiar with. You'll have varied roles at huge players in the tech space and you've already got some great connections, as well. Being an extrovert, I'm sure you interview and present yourself well. I expect you to be very successful shortly after you graduate.

If I had to give you advice, though...

* Always keep learning and keep track of new trends in technology and programming. An easy way to do that is by following the RSS feed for [popular articles saved to Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/popular). 
* Don't sell yourself short: your education was arduous and likely expensive. Market yourself well and make sure you feel compensated fairly for anything you do (professionally or freelance).
* Work-life balance is important. Before you take a job, ask about what your employer does to encourage work-life balance and how they keep people from burning out or working too much.
* Try to compliment your professional work by coding something a little different in your free time, but don't become a slave to it: your goal should be to learn and have fun.
* Never lose sight of your goal. Every once in a while, I ask myself how the work I'm doing is improving the world. I've always enjoyed programming because I can use my talents to create a tool that can make other peoples lives easier. What fulfills you about programming? If you're not doing that at work, try to do it in your free time, or find a different job."

The crucial thing is that I can dissolve this relationship anytime I want. What is really objected to is permanent hierarchies which the individual has no say in and is not able to get away from, and capitalism, with its associated power relationships, is just such a hierarchy.

We should not permit people to exploit for exactly the same reasons we should not permit people to enslave. Resistance to both these things comes under the heading of self-defence, against something imposed from without, which is the historical position of wage labour, the heir of feudalism and slavery. The ""consent"" of the labourer is as illusory as the consent of the serf or the slave. 

Defending one's self and fellow workers from economic exploitation is not somehow setting up a hierarchy. "

fluffhoof,askGSM,1390175326.0,"I'll do my best to answer the few questions I know the answer to.

Dating/relationships

1 - They talk it out. (And yes, there's totally expectation in heterosexual couples for the man to pay, that's probably because heterosexual people have this thing where since the industrial revolution (at least in america) men were the ones to go to work and bring home the money, while women cared for children/house/husband (they were working, they just didn't get paid for it and relied on the husband for the financial stuff), you could read more about this in books dealing with feminism, gender and sexuality).

3a - In my country (Czech republic), I know that lesbian couples do that, gay couples usually adopt abroad/care about the kid from previous marriage (we have sucky laws according to which when you're single you can adopt, but if you're in registered partnership (inferior version of marriage for same-sex couples), you can't and neither can your partner (which can lead to problems down the line)).

marriage

1 - no idea

1a - both are grooms/brides

1b - They talk it out (I know, boring), sometimes they hyphenate, sometimes they stay with their former names, sometimes one takes the name from the other (and I've heard of people talking about mixing the names together to form a new one, but I'm not sure how serious that is)."

Boys excelled in the past under extremely restrictive school environments: remember raps on the knuckles, standing in the corner, etc.?  Look at China, Japan, West African schools.  They are all very ""sit-still-and-don't-move"" and boys excel.

The only bit of ""feminization"" I see is ""loss of recess"" which I have no idea how that is feminist.  I love recess.  Hell, teachers would love recess.  It is most likely a budget issue.

silverionmox,rpg,1390175396.0,"&gt; Well, I'd like to know what Medieval age we're discussing where wage labor was that common.

I talked about differences in wages, which necessarily can only be gleaned from records from more commercially developed economies. At that time and place the practice of day laborers existed, even if they were typically considered just one step above beggars (much like temp workers nowadays, really). There's very little we have to go on in the later Roman/early Medieval manorial and feudal system, which are characterized by a scarcity of sources. Most fantasy goes for Renaissance or early modern style anyway, so it's more relevant as well.

&gt;But more generally, because societies are complex and economic efficiency is often the last thing on their minds when hewing to longstanding cultural frameworks that have been embedded in their social structure for centuries.

Yes, but those traditions often reflect the basic economic reality underlying their social order. They have to, especially in economies that were mostly concerned with obtaining basic resources like food.

&gt;For example, do you know there was a country that harshly segregated certain races and refused to allow them to participate in certain economic roles, despite those races not being inherently unproductive?

And they found out how good it was for their economic development to ignore the real productivity. There's a lot more slack in 20th century economies with international trade and a lot of external energy usage than medieval economies based on a quasi autarchic feudal manors and villages system, so would use caution in making comparisons. Ceteris paribus does not apply here.

Our D-line? One can argue that our DE's are set, and I would for the most part agree. I think we can add an aging DE to our front 4 and he'll be effective as long as he's not in there for most of the game.

However, we need to draft a DT with high potential. Think a player like Hernandez: high potential, low draft spot. If it wasn't for him murdering a couple people one could argue he could have been one of the greatest TE's to play in New England. If we could get a guy like that, that doesn't murder people, we'd be set. We don't need another Big Vince. We just need a guy to eat up 1 to 2 players per play to let the LBs have the gaps to fill. We don't need Warren Sapp. We just need a guy to fill holes.

I think that is a brilliant insight and I agree.

I've seen others who criticized TRP and PUA for a similar reason.... That it lead men to blame themselves for problems in dating or relationships, rather than accepting that the women have autonomy.

So with both of those criticisms combined TRP and PUA can lead to unrealistic accountability for men, and female objectification.

&gt; ...But even so, most 18 year olds are guided by their parents very strongly when they make those choices

His mother most likely supported his decision, because he flew out to San Diego by himself multiple times.

&gt; When you decided to study engineering, you can't mean that you never discussed it once with your parents

Well I still need to get accepted but pretty much, yeah, I told my parents what I want to do, they said ok. The ball's in my court pretty much.

&gt; A lot of porn stars get sucked into the industry out of desperation. If he had had a more stable home environment, maybe none of this would have happened

They're poor, it's not like she abused him or anything, or is abusing drugs. For all we know she had a great job and got laid off.

&gt; And now he has a life-altering shit storm to deal with

It's not over yet, this happened a couple of days ago. he can still transfer schools/get his GED/get the ACLU to force the school to re-enroll him. He has ample time to get his shit together.

Honestly I rebutted you because I needed to rant that being young does not automatically mean you're dumb. At this point, it's water under the bridge, but if you agree that legally he's an adult, and he can legally choose his own decisions, then you need to accept that he can do porn legally, regardless of the fact that he's still in high school or you think his mother should choose his destiny. It's not the industry's responsibility for who wants to join their cast or not, he decided. I guess I have a very laid back attitude about this, because I honestly don't see anything wrong in him pursuing porn for money at his age. If you want it, go get it.

&gt;there's nothing wrong about it

&gt;this is probably normal for a lot of people

&gt;Don't feel bad about this, having a crush on your brother isn't horrible or disgusting. It makes sense - you probably know him really well and it sounds like he's a nice attractive guy. Some people have mentioned already - this could be the beginning of an incest fetish, which is common enough and not at all wrong. Some people who are into incest actually pursue relationships with their family members (which is okay as long as everyone's an adult and not pressured into it) and some have their significant others ""roleplay"" with them. Either is okay.

&gt;I'd say to wait until you're both older before you consider telling him about this.

&gt;Your brother will have his own turn-ons that he needs to discover and explore before you involve him in your own sexual preferences.

&gt;I would guess this is normal. Incest is a fairly common fetish, but some people are weirded out about it.

derleth,TumblrInAction,1390175858.0,"&gt; I think the main reason why both micro and macro economics fail is because they are both based around an overly simplified model.

I agree. I think economics should be treated more like weather forecasting: A complex system we can model to some extent and predict to within some degree of confidence, but nobody makes massive, sweeping, all-encompassing theories about it. Basically, dissociate economics from politics, which is likely impossible.

Where do people *interact* with him in large groups after he came back? Not just saw, but interacted with? I noticed that it never happens. He either is *seen/heard* by large groups, or *interacts* with only one or two people. I find it very strange.

Nothing he actually *did* is something the OT outlines the messiah will do. His deeds are tangental to him claiming to be the messiah.

ibbity,SubredditDrama,1390175882.0,"I think that there probably would be less women in the military than there are now (assuming that the number of female recruits remained steady and didn't increase significantly, though it has increased significantly since women were first allowed to enlist and continues to increase albeit slowly), because more women are too small to meet the physical requirements than are men. I don't believe that *the majority* of currently enlisted female soldiers would be forcibly discharged as a result, but I do believe that there are women currently serving who would not be able to meet the standards and would have to be discharged. 

I couldn't say what percentage of women would meet the standard, nor what percentage of women capable of meeting the standard would choose to enlist; that's entirely speculation and irrelevant. I do believe that the military would have a smaller female presence than it currently does, if all recruits were required to meet the male physical standards in place. I do not, however, believe that the enforcing of a single physical standard would see such a sharp dropoff in female enlistment as to *drastically* lower the amount of female soldiers incoming. What I do believe is that we would see a drastic reduction in the amount of soldiers incoming who were unable to carry out basic tasks for which their strength was insufficient. That these soldiers would be female in no way says anything about the capabilities of the female soldiers who *did* pass the male tests.

Tl;dr I think that there are women in the service who don't belong there because their physical capabilities aren't up to snuff; however I don't believe that this is true of the majority of female soldiers, and I don't think that all female soldiers should be judged based on the insufficiency of those who aren't up to par. I also think that a single physical standard would keep women who aren't fit to serve out, just as the male standard keeps out men who aren't fit to serve."

I would cook, clean, do the romance in the relationship, and always set up any dates we went on. It became stressful feeling all the weight of the relationship. Anytime I tried to bring up her helping it was dismissed as nagging or she would help for a day, but then fall back into staying in bed all day.

My advice is keep trying to get him to help. It's hard not to come off as nagging, but when the other person is acting childish and immature they will see it that way. Do your best to express just how hard it is for you to handle everything and how a little help will go a long way. Communication is the key."

He and my oldest were opposites, almost: My oldest was happiest being held, cuddled close. I learned to cosleep safely with him, because he was absolutely most at peace when he was on me.

My youngest enjoyed being held, but needed to be facing OUT, and he *hated* being wrapped up or swaddled, and fussed if he was cuddled facing me. I kept trying to wrap him up - he was born in February, and we were in an old house, so it was COLD - but he'd kick off his covers. He did sleep in our bed, but wanted his own space. Happy with us there, but not too close, unless he was nursing. I finally got it when I tried putting a blanket sleeper on him when he was a few weeks old, and he fussed and puuushed with his feet, and couldn't sleep. The child liked being cold. He did not want to be covered, coddled, swaddled, etc. He slept SO much better once I learned that about him. I got warnings about how very young children can't regulate their body temperature, but I figured we're not in some frozen tundra, I'm close by - I'm doing what seems to make him happy. He's almost 15 years old and he still doesn't want to wear a coat! It was baffling to me - I can't stand being chilly, I honestly didn't know there were people who not just didn't mind the cold, but actively sought it out!

Like I said, I don't want to overwhelm you with so many possibilities - but I did want to mention it! Watch your child! Look to your daughter to see what works best for her; you'll figure it out, together!"

Besides gapping at the top of the cups, what else was wrong with the fit of the bras you tried? Did you scoop and swoop? Was the band on the loosest/tightest hook? A 30C has too little volume given your measurements, so you shouldn't have gapping. I'm thinking a 30 band is too large for you, and your breast tissue wasn't completely in the cup, ie: the bras were sitting on top of your breasts rather than supporting them."

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390176336.0,"What happens when you've got shallow breasts and you try to wear projected bras has been affectionately nicknamed ""orange in a glass."" Basically, your breasts are shaped like a saucer, and the bra is a teacup.  If you put the saucer upside down on the counter, and put the teacup upside down on top of it, the rim of the teacup will rest on the saucer, and almost none of the saucer will be inside the cup, even if their volumes are the same, or the saucer has more volume than the cup.  So, when you try on projected bras, the wires rest on breast tissue and an insufficient amount of tissue is inside the cup.  This makes the band feel too tight, as it needs to stretch over a good bit of breast tissue as well as your ribcage, and of course the cups stay mostly empty.  

Take a read through the shallow guide, and try some of the excellent bras listed there in a 32C/D.  Ladies your size rarely want or need a band below their snug measurement.  I don't think you're going to find them at J.C. Penney or VS, but there's also a list of online retailers in the buying guide, and many of them have cheap/free shipping in the states.

That person comes to you one day and says, ""I can't seem to connect with my kids, when I try to talk to them it's like they don't want to"". IMO useless advice would be to say ""be yourself"".

*You said the defense took the vast majority of the hit with the cap penalty. Please provide evidence of your claim because I have looked and everything I've found contradicts this claim. Perhaps I'm not interpreting it how you intended it.*

Haslett had 4 years to help the defense make the transition and while it would have helped to have extra money to add 1-2 players in our secondary, we have not lost anyone due to the cap penalty.

If it was safe pvc material, they'd most likely post it up on website to increase their sales and for positive publicity. 

I found [this review](http://www.heyepiphora.com/2012/10/review-james-deen-dildos/) of another Doc Johnson product which confirmed my suspicion. At the end of the article it goes more in depth about the  product's PVC with Sil-A-Gel formula.  It was later identified to be 39%PVC,  61% phthalate. The ""Non-Phthalate PVC""  packaging turned out be a lie after a concerned reviewer sent the product to a lab for independent testing. 

[Here's another review about the same issue](http://pennysdirtythoughts.com/the-dildo-wars-dildology-doc-johnson-and-sex-toy-testing/).

They have very similar muzzle velocities, but the FY has 6m/s^2 drop and the Scout has 15m/s^2 . You can see how different they are on the chart as a result of that design choice.

The snipers already have unrealistically low bullet velocities, which require us to lead our targets at range, which I think is good. It adds skill to the game. However, having different drop rates on them means the majority of people just use the SRR because it eliminates the drop variable on most shots. If all the snipers were the same at 6m/s^2 , I would want them to keep the low velocities, at 15m/s^2 , they should have their bullet velocities increased, and at 9.81m/s^2, some mixture of the two for balance."

derleth,technology,1390176842.0,"&gt; The endowment literally sits there for eternity.

A little pet peeve, but in this era of Bitcoin I think it needs to be said:

**It does not sit there. Invested money earns interest because it allows the bank to make loans and get money into the economy. Invested money is working and creating value.**

Basically, it works like this: A bank needs to be able to make loans, because interest on loans are a way banks make money. In order to make a loan, however, a bank needs to have a certain amount of money on its books to cover the loan's value; this is known as the 'reserve'. In our fractional-reserve system, the bank's total reserve multiplied by a money multiplier is the most the bank can lend out. That's how most money is created in a normal, healthy, modern economy.

So every dollar on the bank's balance sheets as a deposit means more money can be lent out to people who will use it to move the economy along, building houses, making cars, buying cars, and so on. *That* is the engine of economic growth, and *that* is why actual investments are essential for economic health."

codayus,feedthebeast,1390176952.0,"Back in the 1.4.7 days I was an ardent defender of GregTech from the haters.  But the reason was that GT made some stuff harder, but gave you the payoff of some really cool machines, factories, and an endgame.  And besides, in packs like Ultimate or MindCrack, you could use other mods to try and work around GT pain points, and bouncing between mods to craft elaborate setups to do ridiculous things has always been the absolute maximum fun for me.

Unfortunately, GT kept making things harder and harder, and restricting the ability to use other mods to bypass the ""intended"" path.  I abandoned GT, not without some sadness.  And I feel like IC2 is going down the same path.  The metal former exemplifies everything broken about IC2 in a single block.

In the old days, we had ingots, and you crafted them into things.  Now we have ingots, which you craft using a tedious and difficult to automate process into plates, and you use *those* to craft things.  It doesn't make things harder or more expensive; the only thing it does is consume more of my time and attention, and restrict my ability to use non-IC2 processing chains (since only IC2 can make the plates).

I'm a very busy guy.  I love Minecraft, and I like setting up automated systems, dropping down a chunk loader, and then coming back in a day or two when I get another chance to play.  I don't mind something needed a ridiculous amount of iron or whatever; just means I can have fun setting up a MFR laser drill, or a MFFS bore miner, and wait a bit.  But metal formers (and all the other silly changes in IC2 experimental) are just asking me to spend my limited time struggling to make components.  Pass.

This is pretty much the *exact* thing that ruined GT for me, and now it's coming to IC2.  And we're not even getting the payoff GT offered of crazy powerful factories full of endgame machines (eg, centrifuging lava, etc.).

TL;DR:  Don't try and balance mods around player time.  Balance them around energy usage or resource usage or game time.  GT centrifuges took no player time, but tons of game time, and were *great*.  IC2 metal formers take no game time, but tons of player time, and need to die in a fire."

They make a physical connection to complete a circuit from the battery through the coil.  Aside from how/if you can adjust them to fit different sized batteries and atomizers, they're basically metal battery tubes with a mechanical switch (no wires).

The main thing you need to know is that they generally have three safety features...  

* Vent holes to release nasty gasses if you pop a battery.

* A lock of some sort so you don't accidentally fire it.

* Your own knowledge of volts, amps, and resistance.

You don't have to be kidnapped or watch your friend die in war to get PTSD, just like how you don't have to be thrown off a roof to break your leg. 

A thousand people can fall walking down stairs and not break their leg, but all of a sudden there's a person who falls just right and does. The same way, a thousand people can loose their dog without getting PTSD, but then there's this one kid with few friends, who spend every day playing with his dog, who loved his dog with all his heart, who slept with his dog at the foot of his bed every night, and one afternoon he comes home from school to see his dog laying dead on the road - run over by a car. And he gets PTSD. 

Different situations affect different people differently because people live different lives. You **CAN NOT** say that it doesn't make sense for someone to get PTSD going through something when others didn't. There are loads of people who go to war, who watch their friend die, who have them slip away in their arms who **DON'T** get PTSD. Does that mean no one in the same situation should be allowed to? Or that it makes ""less sense"" for someone else to get PTSD in that situation? Fuck no.

Private developers are funded primarily by bank loans, but a massive ""[shadow lending](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/08/opinion/chinas-shadow-banking-problem.html?_r=0)"" market has developed because the Chinese government is reigning in traditional bank lending to real estate developers.

**Shouldn't they lower the asking prices for these apartments?** Imagine a company. The company owns a $10 million dollar apartment building. They owe $5 million on the loan they took out to build it. Even if all of their other sources of income disappear, *they can still pay off that building by selling it*. That gives their stockholders and potential lenders a warm fuzzy feeling.

Now imagine another company with a $10 million dollar apartment building and $5 million in debt. Suddenly, their building is reappraised at a value of $1 million. What happens if their other sources of income dry up? They can sell the building, but they'd still owe another $4 million to the bank. This is called [insolvency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insolvency). It does not give stockholders or potential lenders a warm fuzzy feeling. It could cause the value of their company to plummet and could prevent them from attaining future loans, which is a **huge** issue for a real estate development company that relies on loans to do business.

The real problem is that this is happening on a massive scale, with trillions of dollars of loans that may never be repaid because the projects they funded are now rotting ghost towns. [The Chinese government already issued a $400 billion bailout in 2011](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/31/us-china-economy-debt-idUSTRE74U26320110531) and development has continued to spiral out of control since then, so that should give you some idea of just how big the problem could be."

If you put a computer in a closet and another one on a desk and ran a stress test on both, both computers would start at roughly the same temperature. Then increase at approximately the same rate, and then level out at a temperature where the heat produced by the GPUs, the rate the heat moves into the heat sink and the rate at which the fans transfer heat to the air forms an equilibrium. Both computers will be running at roughly the same temperature. However, if you come back a few hours later, the computer in the closet will have heated the air up significantly, and it will be *much* hotter.

In the same way, running a GPU in a case rather than an open air environment, it will lead to heat being deposited in the case and not being moved out as efficiently as air can be moved around in an open air environment. A proper test would be done over several hours of mining.

Also, with multiple GPUs, the top GPU is going to be **WAY** hotter than the one below it, unless you're using risers. Since the air being brought in to cool the card is hotter."

A different time I had a girl show me her iPhone with a picture of her ID. She said she didn't carry a wallet to a bar because ""guys'll buy me drinks!"". I said you need physical, non-copied ID on you at all times in the bar. She said she'd give me her number and tomorrow she'll meet up and fuck me, if I let her in. At this time there was a lineup about 50 people long, all listening to her and watching me. I said no, calmly and collectively, and re-stated the liquor laws to her.

Congrajewlations,Patriots,1390177610.0,"No, I'm not forgetting 2007.  The deep ball was a great weapon that year, but let's not act that Moss wasn't doing most of the work on those throws.  Randy would beat double and triple coverage all day long and is too fast to overthrow.  Essentially, Brady just threw the ball up for grabs having confidence that Randy Moss would come down with the ball, which he did for the most part.  We do the same exact thing when throwing a deep ball to Gronk.  I'm not saying that Tom can't throw the deep ball, he can, it's just never been his greatest strength.  Couple that with the fact that we haven't had deep threats at receiver in a while (especially this year with sub 6 feet receivers all over the field), and it just isn't a strength for this team or for Brady.  Tom has made a name for himself picking apart defenses on short and shallow routes that require precision, timing, and swiftness, but he has never been known for being the most talented at vertical throwing.  How much of that is a factor of his ability and how much is a factor of not having the right receivers to throw deep?  I'm not sure, but I can tell you one thing; it's very hard to throw the deep route when your receivers (Edelman, Amendola, and Collie) are all limited in size.  A throw that is normally catchable for a 6'3 receiver becomes an overthrow, etc."

If she has a good outlook and is happy with herself and can enjoy her life on her own, that's all anyone can ask from life, really. But in that case, she wouldn't be waiting around for it to get better, she would be happy with her situation as it was with what she has.

Edit: I guess what I mean is, it's better to teach yourself to be comfortable with what you can provide for yourself, rather than dreaming about some future that might never happen."

Mr_JK,toronto,1390177796.0,"I had bed bugs for a year, tried almost everything and could not get rid of them I even replaced the infected beds. How I finally did it was using a vacuum cleaner, a fabric steamer, and some chalk insecticide (the chalk insecticide maybe hard to find but it is very useful). 

What you need to do is wash all your bed sheets and blankets, and put them in the dryer. Drying them is the most important part, make sure you put it on maximum heat. Heat is what kills the bugs the best. After you've done that make sure to steam the bed sheets and blankets. Next the beds. First vacuum the beds, and when i mean vacuum I mean lift the seams on the edges and vacuum the bed bugs out of there. This is where a large portion of the bed bugs love to live so you really need to clean out those [seams](http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/39HH5nG34bCZbJ6QWI2c_g/o.jpg). After vacuuming make sure to steam the seams killing the eggs an go slow over the seams with the steam to really make sure they're dead. After that get underneath the mattress by flipping it and vacuuming and steaming the seams there as well. Also vacuum and steam the whole bed just to be sure of killing the really small bugs. Once your done all that you need to take the chalk insecticide and chalk the seams of the bed. This process should kill all the bugs on your bed but don't just stop there. Vacuum the rooms infected or the whole home if you think necessary and chalk all the edges in the rooms. If your home is carpeted I suggest you get rid of that carpet or else you'll never get rid of these bastards.

Make sure to do all this in the day when they are asleep. Good luck!"

Skyler827,technology,1390177897.0,"What do you think this is, magic?  A backdoor is a backdoor, no amount of money or lobbying can change that.  You cannot bribe the kernel maintainers to accept a malicious exploit that intentionally allows the government to remotely control anyone's machine, and even if you did, the myriad distribution developers who are upgrading their kernel sources would see it.  While only a handful of them compile common distributions, untold scores of them will at least see the changes.  Hundreds more routinely study the code for academic purposes, and embedded systems developers frequently wade through it to perform optimizations and reductions.  To successfully conspire with every last one of them to deceive the world about public code in plain sight is absurd.

I'm not saying the government could never subvert an open source program, and I grant that the government has added many useful features to Linux, but the difficulty of subverting any open source application scales exponentially with the number of people who are in on it, and the Linux kernel is the largest open source project in the world."

Just_Observational,short,1390177911.0,"This makes a fair bit of sense. I understand better for sure now. The longer I spend here the more I understand what a lot of the issues are.

It also explains why nobody ever bothered to explain why they thought I was wrong, or why they thought I was blindly optimistic. They probably assumed I was trolling or would ignore any facts presented to me. I was not once presented facts until the last time I posted here, but was called out at least twice for being one to 'ignore facts or different arguments', which is simply not true.

It is hard to understand the other side but it is definitely worth it to make some progress in understanding, hmm?

I realize too that people of any kind of difference will face descrimination of various types, I have not thought much of the types that people of shorter stature would face to be honest though. It can't be as bad as the old school racism, but that shouldn't be a reason to let it go without acknowledgement or confrontation either.

If it's any consolation I've never heard my friends bash on anyone for being shorter, immediate friends at least, and I generally don't let any unreasonable teasing take place in front of me. I'm a white knight in the fact that people teasing others for stupid things is unacceptable.

If you want to try on bras physically and there's no store nearby that has 28 bands, you can try 30 bands on using the tightest hook (30D/DD) to try and find the styles that work best for you. Try to use brands with firm bands (Calvin Klein, Elle Macpherson, not Betsey Johnson or Freya...), as brands with stretchier brands will still be too long. 

As a shallow girl myself, I find balconettes/halfcups/demis/unpadded work best. Push-ups and plunges are typically a no-go. I really need cups that are quite open up top. Also, if your breasts are wide-set, you are going to want brands that have wider wires so that all of your tissue is inside of the cup and none of it gets pushed outside! 

Unfortunately, I can't give you brand/style recs because I'm not familiar with brands that carry 28 bands. :( Hopefully someone else can chime in!

I did another deep condish and three weeks later did another all over bleach for about 50 minutes. At this point it was the medium brown I was going for but still kind of splotchy. One more round of deep condish and a couple weeks later I had a friend help me spot bleach the still-dark splotchy parts. It looked even but at this point I had to get a serious trim (like 3-4 inches) since the ends were dead.

They only stopped Denver to 1 punt, and ZERO 3 and outs.  They literally could not get off the field to save their life.  By no means did the offense do its part (16 points is never enough to win), it is a team game after all and both sides did not play well enough to win, but they didn't have enough chances to get a rhythm going and ultimately put more points on the scoreboard IMO. I don't know what the time of possession was, but it was totally in Denver's favor.  You just can't allow the amount of 3rd down conversions that we did today and expect to win.

No. Would it be a great movie, and probably have a more lasting following if they preserved the twist (which is the point of *Watchmen*, IMO)? I think so. "

Analogy: imagine you're out on the woods and you have to take a dump.  There's no washrooms, there's no privacy, and you just can't hold it any longer.  So you squat behind a bush, drop trou, and start pushing it out.  But it's not an easy dump - it's the kind where you have to push and strain and aren't sure if you're done.  It's messy and crampy and stinky.  And you're used to using a toilet, so you aren't sure how well you can aim so your stinky poo doesn't land on the pants that are around your ankles, or how long you'll be able to hold your balance without toppling over and landing in a pile of your own shit.

And, in the middle of all this, some random comes up and starts trying to chat you up.

Is that in any way helpful? Wouldn't you much rather they left you alone? And doesn't it weird you out that they'd choose to chat you up in this situation?"

My friend has head twitches, walks almost like he's drunk, and cannot even hand write anything because he has limited control of his hands. His is a very severe case.

* Make 2 player offline available again

* Maybe the ability to play as any iteration of characters? Like play as THPS4 Bam, or THUG Tony Hawk, etc.

* Better place for the community to meet up. Maybe a subreddit? I just don't like having to use Facebook, which I've deleted anyway

Questions:

* Something messed up on my game where the music decided to turn on. It was off before, and that's how I like it (too many shit songs in the THUG2 soundtrack IMO)

flashmedallion,wiiu,1390179055.0,"&gt; if the product they're producing is no longer making money then they will simply stop supporting it.

I think I must be being incredibly thick here because I'm missing this point.  By support you mean stop making games for?  Because there still is an install base for the WiiU.  That doesn't vanish because sales targets have gone down.  There still exist (potential) titles that will sell to the overwhelming majority of that install base.  I'm failing, somewhere, to grasp the logic that they are going to just... stop making games. 

It also makes very poor business sense to abandon their product like that, even they are making less profit on it (they aren't suddenly going to start losing money on titles overnight - a lower sales forecast only suggests less return).  Any business that runs purely on numbers like this isn't going to survive - Nintendo is also a brand remember.  Leading from this point, the WiiU *does* have some luxury, in that it can be loss-supported by the 3DS.  If you look in other industries - hospitality is a great example - this is a relatively common practice.   An owner can use solid restaurant or pub/bar takings to cover the losses of a smaller/niche nightclub or what have you over the amount of time it takes (more than a year, often two) for that secondary business to establish itself and a clientele.  

A short side point:

&gt; the original Wii did not sell because of Mario, Samus, or even Link, it sold because of motion controls, Wii Sports, 

I think it's fair to say the Wii sold a lot of units because of Mario, Samus and Link - but it *unexpectedly exploded* because of motion contols and Wii Sports.  Very important if small difference there.

I'll be the first to admit Nintendo are failing utterly in their marketing - if there was an ad on TV that somehow showed people the insane quality of life the WiiU has bought to my gaming now that I have a job, a life, and family, it would sell like hotcakes.

But I don't see the doom and gloom here.  All I've seen is rabid commentary from armchair business analysts who are either too young to remember how Nintendo has operated or are too caught up in console wars to actually see the woods for the trees.  As much as we all fondly remember the N64, it didn't actually have that many truly great titles over its lifetime.

I use hemorrhoid cream, which helps me, but I'm guessing that your wife must have tried it and it's not helping.

If she hasn't already, she should talk to her doctor about this. It is seriously affecting your lives, and needs to be treated. I'm fairly certain that occasionally they need to be treated surgically, when they get bad enough.

If her doctor has brushed this off, see another doctor. This is a real issue and should not be brushed aside lightly.

If I had to guess, the fact that this conversation is already surfacing in a major paper's op-ed page is an indication that the party bosses see her as a flawed candidate who they're going to have trouble shedding.

Generally speaking, in politics, a lot of the bloodletting gets done in the early campaign for a primary at the request of the party honchos just to see if the candidates got it. Go ask Chris Christie, because he's getting it hard right now in the run-up to the 2016 presidential."

I disagree. Based on intrinsics, I dont think rights exist. I think they're social structures intended to enhance our existence, and outside of perhaps the right to life (since I dont think you can have a good moral code that doesn't respect life), are highly malleable.

brotherbock,triathlon,1390180041.0,"Go to a local bike store and get a fitting. Tell them what's what, and they can help pick the right brand/frame/etc.

The biggest question will be road bike vs. tri bike. Both will be fine for beginning in triathlon. A tri bike will only be a benefit if you plan on going deep into tri, *and* you don't plan on a lot of group rides/straight up bike racing.

Full disclosure: I own only a tri bike, have from the start of my tri training, after one season of borrowed bikes. I don't have any desire to do purely bike racing, and I'm not much for big group rides. 

However, if either of those was true, I'd have likely started with a road bike, and then added a second tri bike later if I'd wanted to. But a tri bike isn't the best suited for group rides, and will be illegal in most bike-only racing.


Edit for basic gear:

Tri shorts and tri tops. These can be worn from start to finish, swim to run. You can train a single sport in anything (bike shorts, running shorts, swimsuit, etc), but none of those are the best for a whole race.

Comfortable bike helmet. 

Comfortable but quality swim goggles. They fit well when you can press them to your eye sockets without the strap around your head, and they stay in place. If they don't, water will get in. Bad.

If you're marathoning, there's a good chance you have a good sports watch. If so and you find it's a good training tool for you, a multisport training watch is a good idea. One that has at least bike and run metrics, if not swim as well. I have a Timex Global Trainer and I like it a lot, but Garmin seems to be the most common (my wife has one, likes it as well)."

TheCryptic,electronic_cigarette,1390180043.0,"&gt;And what is this difference in kilohertz chip that you're talking about? 

Basically the chip in the SVD is slow and inefficient compared to the Provari.  The Provari's power signal is a nice clean line at the voltage you set while the SVD basically tuns the power on and off really quickly to average the voltage you've set.

If you want to geek out on it then go look up Phil Busardo's YouTube reviews of the SVD and the Provari, they're lengthy and detailed and he hooks them up to a scope so you can see in technical terms how they perform.

But anyways, between form factor, &gt;Thanks for replying. Yes I didn't put them in any order.

&gt;... if you've decided to get a VV instead of a VW or a VV/VW, why would you then go ahead and buy more of the same at a different form factor?

Because different form factors are useful in different situations.  I don't want a lengthy tube mod while I'm driving.  I don't want a box mod in my pocket at work.  I don't want to pack my batter charger when I go on a trip.  And the like...  And not all electronics are the same.  The SVD and the MVP2 offer the same settings...  But the MVP2 has better power to the atty.

And looks play a role too.  I have a 22mm and a 23mm mech mod...  Just because I want my mod to fit my atty.

You might as well as someone who collects stamps why they would ever have more than one.

DreamCatcher24,movies,1390180255.0,"&gt;Sinister music. Supposedly to make us think something bad is going to happen and we should be scared. But try watching the few movies without it. They feel more eerily creepy and scary. We aren't being cued up and prompted so it feels more real. Also we don't know to prepare ourselves for the scare like we do when music tells us to.

While not a horror film, No Country for Old Men did this very well. They  built tension without music for a shoot-out scene. I think horror films could do that, and it would add a sense of realism to it, which makes it more scary. 

&gt;Supernatural horror. Sure you might jump at Freddy and Jason in the Cinema and Paranormal experience might widen a few eyes when watching it. I'm sure Ringu made people jump too. But realistically we're adults. We don't go home and worry about monsters in the cupboard or under the bed. Supernatural horror is fun but not actually scary. Really scary is the stuff that could happen. Things like single white female, the hand that rocks the cradle, fatal attraction, cape fear are far far more scary (to me anyway) than any stupid ghost movie or ketchup everywhere movie. Because creepy scary people actually exist. That could happen to us.

I disagree, I feel that this is certainly possible to do. I agree that it isn't realistic, but a clever filmmaker can do things IMO."

But if so, that's because they already have a good handle on things like power, pace, and the like. Many of us have a hard time telling the difference between a 6:45 and a 7:00 pace reliably, which is the sort of thing the watches are good for. Once you race enough to go pro, you know really well how much power you are generating, what speed you're biking at, etc. 

So you're entirely right, it's about what you want, or find useful, to track. It's about much more than HR for me right now :)"

another30yovirgin,relationships,1390180763.0,"What seems especially odd is that he isn't even showing you pictures of his daughter. I would think that as soon as he let you know that he had a daughter and you were ok with it, he'd be beaming with pride about her.

To me, this points to **serious** issues between him and his ex. And that's understandable. His ex sounds like she's got some issues, and you are clearly aware of that, but I think that you need to be neutral with the ex's behavior. You have a lot of opinions about her, but I would be careful *not to let them out into the open*. You need to be the opposite of her--stable, non-judgmental, not jealous. 

As to the daughter, I really hope you're aware that this is going to be difficult. As much as you want to be a role model, confidant, etc., you are going to be the wicked stepmother, or at best the tolerated stepmother. Not only do you not have her actual mother on your side, but children just have a lot of trouble sharing their parents. My stepmother is nice enough and she makes my dad happy, but she drives me crazy sometimes. I hate the idea of people seeing us together and anyone thinking she's my mom. She's not. And it's not that my stepmother did anything wrong, other than marrying my dad. And keep in mind, I'm saying this as someone in my 30s. We get along fine, but I would never go to her if I had a problem or anything like that. I should also point out that since she and my dad got married, he and I have been more distant, and that's difficult to avoid too.

I know a lot of people are telling you that you need to give him an ultimatum. I wouldn't say that's wise. As much as it is strange that you haven't met the daughter yet, it's not something you should demand, in my opinion. On the other hand, it *is* something you need to talk about seriously. Here's a thought: next time he brings up marriage, just say ""you know, if we are going to get married, I am going to have to meet your daughter, right?"" Maybe that can be a segue into having a serious discussion about *why* he's avoiding the situation. Maybe once he talks about why he's not introducing you to her, it will clarify the point in his head and put him more on a track to do it. 

If you simply *demand* to meet her without knowing why this bothers him so much, he is going to feel like you're putting pressure on him to deal with something you don't even understand, and that's going to make him angry and it's going to make you the bad guy. Don't fall into that trap. Instead, make *his* goal (to eventually marry you) the bad guy. He needs to introduce you to his daughter in order to move your relationship forward. 

Find out why he's not ready to introduce you to her, remind him that this introduction has to happen sometime for your relationship to move forward, and once you know what's wrong, do your best to help make it easier on him, always reminding him that you're in this together. And yes, be patient. It's been 5 years. You must love him a lot."

I disagree with your belief that science will one day have the ability to prove for ""an absolute fact that homosexuality is wrong."" I think ""wrong"" is a difficult if not impossible category for science to define.  

If you're not already familiar with it, you may want to look into Michel Foucault's principle of ""reverse discourse."" I think you're referencing it in your statement that the pathologization of homosexuality was twisted to produce positive homosexual identity. In a way, I can't disagree with you, as this is exactly what Foucault described. I'd just like to emphasize that LGBT people are by FAR not the only people to use reverse discourse in the construction of identity. For example, women attempt to reclaim the word ""slut"" in the SlutWalk demonstrations.

Go taller.

You make it sound like such a joke when you're talking about your own life. Yeah sometimes I feel like it would be easier to just end it, but who doesn't? Sure some of the responses on reddit show alot of women prefer bigger penises, but not everyone has a huge penis. Imagine all the dudes who have big dicks, but look like fedora wearing neckbeards. I doubt they get women. 

Why not atleast better yourself and try to find someone who accepts you vs just giving up because you believe everything you read on the internet. Try to change people's minds. Sure not all of us are that special but you have to try.

With this mindset I've been able to talk to girls and even get invited with them recently which I just wouldn't have thought possible a couple of months ago. I get the feeling that sex is coming closer for me, but I'm not scared that my dick will be too small. I just want to pleasure the girl in every way that I possibly can before I stick it in. And from there I'll decide whether or not I want to live. 

This sub is becoming so misogynistic to the point where it's making many of you hate yourselves more because you believe maybe a dozen women speak for millions of women. Alot of responses on reddit have confirmed that there are soo many different preferences that women have. Don't let size queens define you, just try your best to work with what you got.

How young is too young? Like the 10 year old girl, or whatever the ""World Record"" is for youngest birth.

Personally I think 25 is too young, but that's just me. Early 30s would be ideal for me. You have more life experience, more likely to have a stable living environment, you're still young enough to be able to keep up with your kids as they age etc.

Sixteen year olds having kids? I don't think it has much of an effect on society. Shows like 16 &amp; Pregnant? Yeah I don't know if they're good or bad for society. I've never watched the show to be honest.

I sætningen ""Knep mig(,) det er billigt"" skal der være et komma (jf. vores nuværende kommaregler). Sætningen vil bare være tvetydig på skrift, mens det giver mening verbalt, hvor det er trykket der bestemmer meningen. Om der er tryk på 'det' eller ikke.

We stored it behind the bar on a daily-sanitized shelf above the prep station. It's comically large, but not so unwieldy you couldn't find a place to put it. Nobody - manager, server, bartender, chef, health inspector - would ever let something like that hit the floor, let alone intentionally place it there.

We used it as a novelty/conversation piece, or as a parlor trick, exchanging the reasonable sized grinders with the behemoth when it might get a laugh. It was cleaned as frequently as the other grinders were (2x/week); we just never put more than about 20 peppercorns in it at once.

You told him you were uncomfortable with the pictures, he ""promised"" you he would get rid of them *and even went so far as to ""prove"" it by showing you his porn folder*. He REALLY took this lie above and beyond.

He saved those pictures on purpose, and told you he deleted them. You've stated as much in multiple ways **AND HE EVEN TOLD YOU OUTRIGHT - AFTER LYING ABOUT IT AGAIN FIRST**. 

Now he's trying to crawl out of his hole by transferring his guilt onto you and talking about how he feels the relationship is unstable enough that he's worried you could leave at any time. This is a comment that will almost always make the receiving partner (you in this case) want to do *whatever they can* to make things better, thinking THEY are the problem.

DO NOT FALL FOR THIS BULLSHIT.

He lied to you, repeatedly. 

The rest of the relationship (aside from this shit covered liesickle) may be rainbows and sunshine, but at the end of the day do you **REALLY** want a man in your life who finds it so easy and convenient to lie to you? Do you want this type of man helping to raise and educate your child? What will the next lie be?

Your post doesn't even say that he apologized for lying about it! Not that that would make it less disrespectful, but at least then he would sound like he cared that he screwed up. I am almost willing to bet that he will continue to lie to you about other things if you stay with him.

AND ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, he blamed keeping the pictures of his exes on you, and his fear that you would leave him...

Wow.

A+ for effort, but EPIC FAIL for being a real and worthy human being.

Don't let him exploit your insecurities, and don't eat up his excuses, lies, and manipulation any longer. You've already done it for too long. Just think back to how long it's been since he told you he'd originally deleted those pictures (and yet intentionally saved them to be looked through again). He's been lying to you AT LEAST that long.

**YOU. AND. YOUR. CHILD. DESERVE. BETTER.** You stated in another comment that he's very involved in your child's life. The longer you're with him the longer she's going to see someone treating others like this as being acceptable. Your child should have someone with her mother who doesn't lie to her (and who is in love with/attracted to her enough to not need naked pictures of an ex to get off). Kids are smart, and they learn a lot from what we do, how we act, and from the ways we feel about things. Don't let lying to others being ""ok"" be the lesson she's taught here."

Possibly also with [Baccano!](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2251/Baccano!), where there are different factions clashing or allying with each other over various things. Because the story is told from multiple perspectives, there isn't any single protagonist or antagonist. Also, there are only hints of romance, nothing really heavy. However, there are hints of romance between a few characters from different factions that are not necessarily allies."

myrrlyn,teslore,1390181544.0,"Okay. So the first thing we need to cover is that this universe, to which I will refer as the Aurbis (even though this universe is slightly bigger than the realm known as Aurbis), is a Dream within a being known as the Godhead to those inside. The Godhead cannot interact with us, nor we him.

So. Aurbis is someone's Dream. But whose? For a long time, this question was taken as irrelevant and unanswerable, but it turns out that we actually DO have an answer, and it actually IS important.

____

In a universe that may or may not have been a Dream but we don't really care about that at present, there were three entities with whom we are concerned. They were named Anu, Padhome/Padomay, and Nir. I shall refer to each of these as Anu-1, Padhome-1, and Nir-1, respectively.

The second myth you listed is an accurate description of the events of THAT universe, which is NOT the Aurbis.

Anu-1 was so distraught at the events that transpired that he couldn't bear to face the reality of his universe, so he fled into the sun and began to Dream up his own world.

Have you ever had a dream that starred you and people you knew, but neither dream-you nor dream-them acted like you or them actually would in real life?

Anu-1 Dreamed up a world that featured himself as Anu-2 and Padhome-1 as Padhome-2. (As a side note, it's possible that Padhome-2 **is** Padhome-1, in Anu's Dream, and that the universes are a long telescoping set of Anuics with one single Padhome running between them. Which is...yeah I can't even. Moving on)

So in Anu-1's Dream, the Aurbis, Anu-2 and Padhome-2 started out as separate entities, one as pure stasis, one as pure change. Black Silence and White Noise, basically. Then they grew and collided and the rest, as they say, is history.

And because there's no such thing as a clean story, the Hist are actually remnants of Anu-1's world that got carried over into this one."

One other point: triathletes love love love spending money on 

a) techie stuff, and

b) anything with the prefix 'aero-' in front of it.

It's your choice, but IMO much of it is wasted money. Some company will show you an 'aero bento box' (a storage box that mounts on your top tub, behind your handlebars/stem). And they'll call it aero because they have made it into a teardrop shape. And, if pressed, they might show you some windtunnel pictures that show colored blasts of wind slipping by the aero box while not doing so past the other, boxier, box.

But they will likely have no idea how much faster that will make you. OR, if they do, the data is...underwhelming. I have seen sooooo many people spend thousands of dollars on gear that has been shown to save you 5 seconds over a 40k bike. If you're heading for the podium and some money, hey, go for it.

But if you're doing this to challenge yourself...well, is 5 seconds worth $2000?

The companies that make this stuff know that triathletes are known as wasteful spenders (in my experience it's sadly true), and they prey on us, like any good company does.

Just remember that the motor trumps the bells and whistles. 

Full Disclosure: I have Hed H3 wheels and an aero helmet. Got the helmet as a gift (and helmets actually make one of the bigger differences), and I got the wheels for a steal. YMMV. :)"

Once again, TRADITIONAL models of school (created by men), consisted of sitting still and being quiet.  Ask your parents and grandparents.  These traditional models are used in countries in which only males teach to male students.

Modern, American models consist of hands on, student directed activities.

lunarbizarro,asktransgender,1390181763.0,"It's medically inaccurate though: this isn't foreign tissue, so there's no ""attacking."" The reason we need to dilate is that our neovaginas aren't structurally connected to anything that would support the structure, that is, no cervix, no internal muscles, etc. Having no structure to keep it in place, the natural course of action is to push out. This is similar to cis neovaginas or cis women with various medical issues.

This is also similar to piercings: biologically inert materials won't be attacked by the body, so the purpose of the jewellery isn't pushing back against the body's ""attack,"" it's simply preventing the inertia of skin to push outwards. You'll note that fully healed piercings often don't fully close; this is because the skin pushes outwards to the point of hitting each other, so there's no further place to push.

Also, in hearing stories of women who stopped dilating, the body doesn't entirely remove the vagina. It usually hits a point of 1-2 inches of depth where there's no further inertial drive to move.

Edit: my original post was also more in regards to people referring to established neovaginas, that is, 3+ months post op, as open wounds. Obviously immediately post op vaginas are quite literal wounds. "

We met in May 2012 for the first time. I had a long distance boyfriend at the time. That wasn't a great relationship. Anyway, I met OTGA for the first time and we instantly clicked. I thought he was cute as hell, and he's said that he thought I was hot from the moment he saw me, before the friend he was with recognised me and greeted me.

The 3 of us had an awesome night, and I stayed the night with OTGA (though it wasn't a one night stand - I just didn't want to go home and we may have cuddled a bit).

I met up with him a few times in the coming weeks but eventually we dropped contact, probably because I was still with the long distance boyfriend. But I never stopped thinking about this guy. We had really hit it off, and every now and then I'd see his face appear on my Facebook newsfeed from his band's page. But, I had decided I would struggle along with the long-distance guy. He was what I knew and I followed his orders to never speak to OTGA again.

…At least until the end of 2012. 6 or whatever months after last seeing OTGA, he texted me out of the blue, asking how I was. I almost didn't believe it at first. I replied, we got talking again. We eventually met up.

He's been my boyfriend for 10 months now - since March 24th 2013. I couldn't be happier with him. I still find him as cute as when I first said hi to him, if not more. He seems to still find me hot which I'm surprised at but certainly not complaining about.

Sometimes.

My mother is blunt and I often am as well.  I don't think she wanted me to share in interest.  She blames me for the fact that she did not date or let men around me and told me it was to avoid them trying to take advantage of me.  When I hit puberty she started getting me condoms, a simple sex toy and such.  She told me to not be ashamed and sex, be safe and learn about my body so that I can find myself a decent lover in the future.  She was concerned about weird things in my life, but she never made me feel like I was sexually at risk living with her.  

Dude, get out of that house.  I don't think I could have left if it wasn't for the help of my husband (we've been together since high school).  I can tell you that just one day outside of her home and I knew I was never going to go back.  I can understand not being medicated.  She's been diagnosed with a few things but claims that she knows better as a ""medical professional.""  Sorry, mom, but you only know sex."

NiKnight42,ADHD,1390182231.0,"I'm not an expert, but I do have a good understanding of neuroscience (or at least I'd like to think that I do).

First, can you provide a link to that study on Parkinson's? I'd love to read it. 

Second, there is still a lot to be understood about ADHD, but one hypothesis that I really like has to do with the neurotransmitter dopamine. In a nutshell, and to the best of my understanding, this theory explains why we are able to calm down and focus when we take a drug composed of chemicals that would make anyone else hyper. It is believed that those with ADHD have malfunctioning dopamine receptors, and I remember reading a study summary that stated there was an inverse relation between dopamine activity and symptoms of ADHD. More dopamine from amphetamine use means reduced symptoms for us, so that's why we take the medications that we do. 

Next, is Parkinson's. This disease is part of a collection of basal ganglia movement disorders (which, as my neuroscience professor said, ""are scary sons of bitches""). Parkinson's is dopamine disorder in which the dopamine producing cells of the substantia nigra die/degenerate. This lack of dopamine then messes up the rest of the pathways in the basal ganglia, causing unintended movement. 

So, in a way, ADHD and Parkinson's are both diseases based on dopamine, but again, the dopamine hypothesis of ADHD is a hypothesis,  not an absolute. 

Now to try and really answer your question. 

It is difficult to predict what using meds like adderall for years and years will do to us. Adderall was introduced in 1996, and the XR formulation came out in 2006. Because neither have been out long (relatively speaking), long term effects are not exactly known. Based on primate studies, there haven't been any major issues. Following the prescription is of course the safest way to take the medication, and there is the occasional case of stimulant-induced psychosis even when following the doctor's orders.

Tl; Dr: Not a lot is known about the long term effects of adderall use right now, but obviously more information will be discovered in probably the very near future. 

Also, I apologize for any proofreading errors. And if you want any sources, I'll make sure I don't delete my browser links for a while. 

EDIT: changed theory to hypothesis"

Anyways, does the Lions absolutely need CJ especially when the Lions employ Stafford as a QB? 

I know he's the GOAT of WRs nowadays but I'm not sure if elite WRs win games, as evident by Arizona. Is it dumb to get rid of CJ for $$ reasons and just settle for good to very good WRs, while making the entire team more balanced and fleshed out? It's just that, tying a massive amount of money to QBs makes sense but to a WR? Does a WR in general make a difference between a 6-10 season to a 10-6 season? 

Sorry guys, I just wanted to get this off my chest as I mentioned above. I can get tying a bunch of money to football positions, but why WRs? Would it be crazy to cut CJ? Unless if tying a bunch of money to CJ doesn't necessarily hold back the team, then I guess it could be okay. "

There are definitely men out there who think that women are only good for sex. Those men hit on girls at bars until one of them sleeps with them. They get into the PUA community and do whatever it takes to get laid. They don't get completely obsessed with one woman. 

Guys who complain about the friendzone are feeling extreme attachment, which is really not the same as sexual attraction. There may be a subset of these men who doesn't appreciate the value of women's company outside of a relationship, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. It is very frustrating when you develop strong feelings for someone who doesn't feel the same way about you, and it kind of sucks that everyone on reddit is convinced that it's all about sex, because that's not true at all."

&gt; For more than a decade I wondered over the meaning of the second part and what was the surreal linkage between the two?

I'm really excited to try the chocolate cookie crust and make a faux-Oreo pudding pie. Haven't had one of those in years.

You have to realize that we feel the same about our dicks the same way a woman is insecure about her own physique. Like being fat or having boobs that sag down to the ground. 

Now imagine if you were either of those, and now imagine what people would say about you when you couldn't change either of those things. You feel like you are less than a human. 

Sure if everyone said nothing about small dicks being bad there would be no issues but we have this idea ingrained into our head everyday through personal exchanges and media that big dicks is what every woman wants. Sure it doesn't matter to you but it matters to **us** on how we see ourselves in society. But hey if there's a girl who accepts for who I am and what I have my insecurities will disappear.

GetOverItAndMoveOn,short,1390183214.0,"&gt; If you ask me, your assertion that being taller is ""looking better"" is ridiculous and is a mindset that you need to drop, because it factually is not true

No mate. It's a fact. I didn't make the rules, I just play by them. Here is some [proof](http://imgur.com/3mqbTMM)

Not to mention that the only physical attributes that women usually list for men on dating sites is that they be tall.

Being short is esentially being ugly in the eyes of a lot of women. The reason women wear makeup is to look better even though they know that people could see them without it.

Men can wear shoe lifts to look better even if they know that people could see them without them.

It was one of the best experiences of my life, so if you're not within that age group, I'd recommend recommending it to someone you know who is. 

This is how I came to feel so close to the park and knowledgable of it as well. Basically, we'd work a full 40 hours a week and then do other stuff on weekends. Lodging and food were taken out of our earnings, I believe. The work consisted mostly of trail/ campsite repair, preservation and rehabilitation. With my crew, we were doing a lot of work on trails, built some fences in the valley and replaced some bear bins. On the weekends, we would either be going to a lake or river by our housing or taking a backpacking trip. That was the best part. You were also supposed to be stationed in a different place every two weeks, so I kind of lived in different sections of the park. We went up to a lot of places in the back country that I would've never been to otherwise and we did a trip to Half Dome. 

I go to Yosemite with my family every year and because of this program I got to instill new traditions into that trip. We always visit Tenaya Lake now, and we have to take a bike ride through the valley along the fence My crew installed and past the STOP sign I single handedly put in the ground. I also got to lead my family on their first ever time climbing Half Dome. 

It was a very great experience. "

Look at the JT Proflex, Empire Event, Dye I3/I4, VForce Grill/Profiler, Sly Profit/**Annex MI7**, **Proto Switch FS** and Proto Axis (i have bolded the cheapest ones). these all have replaceable thermal lenses and are of high quality. if you can, look in a mirror with them on so you can see how the coverage is - especially for your ears! For a tank, the basic 47 or 48 ci/3000 psi steel tanks will do fine, they're pretty much all the same so just buy whatever is cheapest. i don't know what the German regulations are for hydro static testing but there should be a serial number of some kind stamped on the bottle that will tell you how long it will last before it needs testing. check on the German paintball forums or ask the people that run the field.

your budget seems a little bit tight, if you can get a used Halo hopper grab one of those and it will last you forever as well. if that is too expensive, get a Proto Primo. for guns you're looking at whatever you can get your hands on cheap haha, look for a used Spyder, Azodin, GOG, or similar. all the mechanical blowback markers are pretty similar and there are about a million different Spyder clones. believe it or not the gun is the least of your concerns, they're easy to buy and sell if you outgrow them or grow bored, and if you stick to my advice every other piece of your kit will transfer from gun to gun with no problems (and hold its value over time)

I am sorry, I know it is tough, but your body needs a chance to repair itself and there is NO shame in explaining ""I had an iron deficiency that is being treated and it made my lashes fall out. Sucks, huh?"" People are generally nice. They won't judge you. You can totally try to work on killer makeup or clothing elsewhere to draw attention to your other features while you feel self-conscious about this.

And I noticed in your comment history (sorry, creeping) that you have a history of eating disorders. Same here. Are you sure, when you are being completely honest, that you are eating enough? I noticed, actually, when I significantly upped my intake in treatment that my hair fell out more, starting about a month in and lasting for a couple of months. It takes a little while for nutrient problems to make themselves visible in stuff like your hair and your nails, which grow slowly over time. So if you have dealt with significant undereating in the past few months, it could be a symptom of that. It could also be a rare side effect for many medications, including birth control.

&gt; ""...facts strongly suggested that gastrointestinal damage by NSAIDs [non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs] was more severe in β-glucan-administered mice, resulting in peritonitis by enteric bacteria [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bacterial_peritonitis] and leading to death.""

Um, what!!?? How convenient that they don't put any warnings or information on the box. Granted, I should've educated myself before buying into a new ""health"" product. Thinking it's perfectly fine to eat COOKIES and TREAT MY HEADACHE at the same time? Sheer madness!

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1390183753.0,"Since this is a thread all about making clear definitions for things, I'm going to assume the level of pedantry I'm about to stoop to is desirable. If not, please disregard. :) I realise that being concise is one of your goals here, so this might be overdoing it. These are still things I'm curious about though.

The first thing is that implicit in a few of these definitions is a concept of 'on average'. For instance, in a Secoia, men have more material wealth than women - on average. But of course, 'average' can mean different things. Specifically, here, we should talk about whether men in such a culture have a higher mean wealth or a higher median wealth. For what it's worth, this detail doesn't change my mind about whether or not 'we' (vaguely defined western culture) live in a Secoia, but it's something I can imagine entangling future discussions if it goes unspecified. For instance, I suspect that many consider men to have a greater mean social power in North America, but women have a greater median social power. If that turned out to be true, it's not clear whether North America should still be considered a patriarchy according to your definition.

The second thing that might be useful for future conversations, though I admit isn't strictly required for this thread, is to mention some things that aren't part of the feminist definition of patriarchy. For instance:

 * MadeUpTerm6: In a MUT6 society, men are considered to be the moral superiors of women. For instance, if a wrongful act has been committed and a man and a woman are the two suspects, if all else is equal the woman will be considered the more likely guilty party. This may be reflected by laws or by social attitudes.

 * MadeUpTerm7: In a MUT7 society, men are considered to have more intrinsic value than women. For instance, a man will likely be helped before a woman if they are both suffering some kind of medical distress in a public place.

Adding these two terms into the mix, according to my understanding, the feminist definition of patriarchy *doesn't change.* That is:

 * Patriarchy: A patriarchal culture (or Patriarchy for short), is a culture which is Srolian, Govian, Secoian, and Agentian. Whether a society is a MUT6 or a MUT7 is explicitly irrelevant to whether or not it can be considered a patriarchy.

I suspect that being explicit about this would clear up a significant amount of confusion about the term between MRAs and feminists.

The third thing I wanted to mention is something I am genuinely confused about myself. That is, we're talking about societies, here - what is the scope of the term 'society'? For instance, say you've got America (the country, not the continent). Let's say America is a patriarchy according to your definition. However, let's imagine for a moment that in, I dunno, Texas, men are disenfranchised and the government is run by women. Therefore, Texas is not a Govia, but America is. So... are Texans living in a patriarchy? This may be relevant trying to figure out whether something that happened to a man in Texas could be considered systemic sexism, for instance.

The fourth thing is not really about the definition of patriarchy, but it's relevant to a usage of the term that seems to cause controversy - specifically, it's all about blame. I'm going to use an example here. Say you have a person with a tall boyfriend. You might say of her ""Yeah, her house is full of stuff kept on high shelves - it's because of her tall boyfriend."" You might also say ""Yeah, she's less lonely than she used to be, thanks to her tall boyfriend."" In the first example, the implication is that the stuff is kept on high shelves because of her boyfriend's tallness - he keeps putting stuff on high shelves, because he's tall. The second example, you might be inclined to say ""Wait, what? She's not less lonely because her boyfriend is tall!"" The statement is still technically correct, though, so long as her tall boyfriend is the one keeping her company - the tallness was perhaps implied to be relevant, but it isn't.

This relates to when people blame something on the patriarchy. If the society we live in is a patriarchy, then anything that happens because of society happens because of the patriarchy, technically. However, I think it rubs a lot of MRAs the wrong way when someone says ""Yeah, men go to prison more for the same crime because of patriarchy"" because that particular social injustice could readily exist in the absence of patriarchy. Certainly the srolia is to blame for that problem, but it seems dubious to say the patriarchy is to blame. I suppose that's more a definition problem with the word 'blame' than anything else, though, so perhaps I'm just rambling at this point. :)"

ByronicAsian,anime,1390183765.0,"Yea, Japanese courts has their roots with Napoelonic system.

The main differences IMO are that :

-The enquiry isn't led by the prosecution but by an investigative judge whose job isn't to prove the case but to find relevant evidences. More specifically, he's duty bound to search for exculpatory evidences too. The prosecution (like the defense) can request such or such investigation but it isn't in charge. When he has finished, he transmits all information to the court and doesn't take part any more in the process (in very rare cases he can be called as a witness, generally when the court thinks he has seriously botched his job and wants some splaining) although in Japan, the Prosecution is still in charge of the investigation.

-There isn't any plea system. There will be a trial whether or not the accused admits to the crime. As a consequences, no ""deals"" offered by the prosecution, either. Although prosecutors can make unofficial promises to the defense. 

-The trial isn't a kind of game between two sides with the judge acting only as a referee of sort, but more like a debate involving all parties, and directed by the presiding judge (there are three of them sitting). Most questions to the witnesses will be asked directly by the judge, but the prosecutor, the defense attorney, the victim's attorney will question them too. As I recently noted, a direct exchange between the accused and a witness isn't uncommon. Also, there aren't prosecution witnesses and defense witnesses. Hence the prevalent use of dossiers as opposed to actual cross examination for most cases. Again, not always the case especially for more contested trials.

-Irrecevable evidences are much more limited. For instance, expressing opinions, reporting second-hand testimonies, recounting the life of the accused are all perfectly fine. 


Any similarities to the US system and changes from the French is the result of the additional protections for the accused written in my US occupational authorities during the rewriting of the constitution. "

This results in faster onset of action, which is one feature we worry about when considering a drug's potential to cause psychological dependence. The user's brain readily associates the drug's effects with the physical act of taking the tablet, which is not good. This is the same reason a lot of healthcare professionals are happy that an extended-release hydrocodone product is finally going to be coming to market; the immediate-release stuff used to manage chronic pain currently can not be helping the opiate abuse problem we have."

Serae,AskReddit,1390183893.0,"I can understand how you feel.  My mother has become a family mooch and I know the duty of taking care of her and paying for her is going to eventually come my way (and I know my marriage will suffer for it when the time comes).  For me it's the guilt.  Even thinking about my own life away from it still gives me guilt pangs.  It's easy to tell people to get out, look out for yourself, but having family like this is emotionally complicated.  Sometimes I still think I will only truly be free when my family has died out (she's not the only narcissist in the family, but that's not what the post is about).

I only learned to say no this past year.  It has helped me immensely get through feelings of guilt or inadequacy.  Certainly post about it in /r/raisedbynarcissists.  I occasionally comment and it does help to get some of those things out.  You aren't alone in this experience but I think the most important thing to take away is that: you can say no, you are allowed to be happy, and you are not a terrible person for either of these things.

Yes, she's broken bones.  Ribs several times, and my wrist four times.  Not counting other injuries. :/

She never cared about grades, sports, curfew or any of that.  She told me many times, ""If you start doing drugs just save some for me and you won't be in trouble.  If I find them and you didn't share I'll call the cops.""  I was as likely to get slapped up for not hanging a towel a certain way as I was for catching her in a lie and calling her on it.  I rarely had a private phone call and sometimes found her stalking me in her car.  In equal measures we might not talk for weeks and one day I would find everything I owned in the yard or in boxes at another family member's house without a word."

2classy,AskWomen,1390183938.0,"I'm white. My first boyfriend was Indian (and super Christian whereas I'm super not) so you could write a novel about our differences in values. We dated a whole year without him ever telling his parents because he was afraid of their reaction.  One time he semi-jokingly told me that his scary uncle would send people to come kill me if they found out about me. Yikes. We also could never hold hands in public or talk very openly about our relationship because his parents have tons of friends who work on our campus who would spy on him. In fact, we almost got caught one time when a family friend saw us out together and reported to his parents that they saw him out being affectionate with a white girl. We could never do normally couple-y things like meet each other's family (he couldn't go anywhere really without telling his parents and getting their okay), going on vacations, or even calling each other on the phone or texting when he was at home. It was absolutely awful. Needless to say, my parents were very unhappy with the situation and thrilled when we finally broke up. Other than parental issues, there were really no issues with prejudices from our peers and occasionally we would get ugly looks from older Indians on the street. 

My second (and current) boyfriend is half hispanic and things are great. He was able to tell his parents about me (they're a mixed couple so us dating was no big deal at all to them) and we were able to meet each others parents (which seems like a small thing but was so huge to me after my last relationship). We really don't have any cultural differences as he doesn't identify really as hispanic. There's no barriers or issues with us dating from friends, family, or random strangers on the street. 

I've also gone out on dates with Asian guys, black guys, and white guys. But never had a relationship with any of them. "
luxury_banana,SRSsucks,1390183940.0,"All of this railing against ""western beauty standards"" is basically just whining from [sad potato-shaped feminists who subsist on a diet of things like candy-corn oreos.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMJS2k_vBY0) Rather than clean up their diet and get some token 20 minutes a day a few times a week worth of exercise, they present a strawman argument in the form of anorexic models which really just model clothes made by gay men who use those models as walking mannequins. They also like to try to talk as if something must be wrong with guys who don't find their rotund physique sexy.

The reality is that heterosexual men are far less picky than heterosexual women. Most heterosexual men don't mind a little extra weight as long as it's not enough to make you look like that thing in that video I linked. There are no fucked up height requirements or much of anything in terms of congenital traits that wouldn't also apply to men. None of that shit guys have to deal with. On the other hand, the only acceptable male body shape for the most part is a muscular build. Fat guys are even more metaphorically fucked than fat women (although no one even pretends to care) and really thin guys for the most part don't get much attention--I'd know since I used to be one and I got a ton of negative comments and was rejected quite a few times on that basis alone.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1390184154.0,"Well, here;'s the thing, i think like a sociologist, and often a lot of bad sociological practices are justified under the premise that they don't ACTIVELY hurt people...it's just the way it is. Well, I say when the way were doing thing sucks and we can act in ways to benefit more people...screw that distinction.

Thats the main problem i have with libertarianism, it's not a system of morality well equipped to deal with the nuances of morality, it comes up with abstractions out of touch with reality and takes them to the extreme. It's more interested in making morality ""universal"", when I'm more interested in the results, and sometimes that requires a certain level of inconsistency based on the circumstances involved.

Taxation is a necessity in the modern world. We tried a government with no taxation, it had no military, government was dysfunctional, etc. It was called the articles of confederation. It's a necessity, and i could care less about trying to make these high and mighty sounding arguments that have no basis on the real world. 

If I had to describe my moral system, I'm very much a utilitarian. I try not to take that to extremes since that can lead to bad, self defeating consequences in itself, but ultimately, I care about the greater good. I care about maximizing societal benefit. I don't care about universal principles and extremes, because while such things may be effective 99% of the time, there's always that 1%. And that's the problem I have with all moral systems really. Taken to the extreme, all of them suck. So I pick and choose, jump between them, sometimes act inconsistently, but you know what? Since morality is ultimately largely subjective anyway, it's worth it. 

So for me, I approach things from the perspective of:

1) What is a problem in society?

2) Why is it a problem?

3) What are the potential solutions to solving said problem?

4) Which of these solutions is best, and why?

5) Implement.

6) Did the solution fix the problem? How could we fix it better?

7) Repeat 5 and 6 until problem solved.

It's a muddle through approach rather than an approach with some sort of grand design or utopia in mind.

That being said, in approach to taxes...

1) Problem. We have no military.

2) if we don't have a military, we will be open to attack.

3) Either tax people, or ask them nicely to provide funds.

4) Asking people don't work, so a tax is necessary. 

5) Tax people, use funds to build military?

6) Is the problem solved? YES.

Or, wealth inequality.

1) Problem, wealth inequality is increasing.

2) Rich are getting richer, poor are getting poorly, many people are suffering, and doing worse than they could be, while some are doing WAY better than they need to live comfortably.

3) Job creation, social programs, charity.

4) Charity isn't effective, job creation is of limited effectiveness, and leads to exploitation, wealth redistribution in the form of taxes and social programs works.

5) Implement a social program.

6) Analyze effectiveness.

7) Course correct. 

It's a simple approach. Rights and stuff can play a part in the cost benefit analysis IMO. We can determine whether preserving rights outweighs the problem or not. You mgiht think on taxation a right to property is more important than reducing poverty for example, but I disagree. You mentioned it's ""my"" idea of fairness, but that's the thing, besides perhaps the right to life and minimizing physical pain, morality is subjective, it's opinion based. Your property rights are not a universal truth, they;'re an opinion. No matter how you try to justify it, regardless of how consistent you are, it's ALWAYS just an opinion when you get beyond the basics of self preservation.

That being said, don't think of my as philosophically ignorant...I'm not ignorant of philosophy, I've just read enough of it to know that if you try hard enough you can use it to justify just about everything...all philosophy is, is a formalized thought process, and there's no one right thought process. And considering how all moral philosophies have flaws, I'm perfectly fine with practicing in an informal, loose fashion, rather than strict adherance to just one. I think fixed philosophies just lead to problems, since it makes you closed minded and unwilling to approach things from multiple perspectives."

Of course, 60 miles per hour is actually only 96km/h so you're really going a crazy 6km/h over the limit. I don't honestly see why I cop would stop you. Still, I'd probably stick to doing a speed just over the limit as it reduces road rage among the people behind you.

I tried to reconnect a few times and never received any replies.  I know who my half-siblings are and occasionally peek at them on FB but never made contact.  They seem a lot like me but also seem very happy.  I don't want to get involved with screwing up their family dynamics.

I know my father's wife is apparently batshit crazy, much like my mother, and very controlling.  He made that very clear the two times we met when she called every few minutes and screamed at him over it.  He needed to preserve the family he had.  I get it and I don't fault him for it.

I didn't have a father growing up so I can't really miss something I know nothing about.  My family is very small, very manipulative and dying out.  I don't really have any pangs for ""family life,"" and feel more at ease with just my husband and my rabbit. My husband's family is normal, keeps to themselves and are nice to be around at holidays.  That's enough for me.

I'm easy to find online and never changed my name when I got married.  If my father ever sought me out I'd we open to him.  If he doesn't that's ok too.

Lionhearted09,WTF,1390184503.0,"I used to work for Urbanspoon and can tell you that they absolutely do not filter any reviews. In fact a lot of restaurants hate Urbanspoon more because of it. Think about it if you get one bad review it never goes away whether the person is telling the truth or not. I had plenty of people tell me they would but from me if I could take away a few negative reviews and never could. The only reviews that got removed were ones that overly cursed or ones that were proven to be false. 

I did see plenty of reviews that I beleived to be fake but unless there is definite proof Urbanspoon doesn't remove them. They will monitor IP addresses though so if a restaurant attempts to make 20 reviews from the restaurant, they can be banned from Urbanspoon. That has happened or if someone tries to make a lot of fake accounts and post a lot of negative reviews those can be taken off too. They can also monitor referral links. A few years ago some guy came on to reddit and posted a link to an Urbanspoon page of a restaurant he said was doing a ton of shady things. Overnight that page had almost 30 new reviews but all of them came from the reddit link so all was removed. "

dreadsies,AskReddit,1390184515.0,"I used to work as part of [WIRES (WIldlife REScue)](http://www.wires.org.au/), in Sydney - at least once a month we'd get a call about a drop bear on the Harbour Bridge, so it was me and two others who had to put on the harness ([similar to this](http://kerrect.com.au/assets/header_image_access.jpg)) and climb the bridge with a big net on a pole.

Basically, we'd nudge it into the net from a distance, which we then pulled closed with a string - 2 of us would hold the net with poles on either side while the 3rd would carefully put the net into a dark canvas bag, detaching it from the poles. Very similar to how you catch a python or other snake - once they're wrapped up in the dark, they go pretty docile.

We'd carry it back down (again, between the two of us - they're heavy, upward of 60kg for the fully grown males!), tag it, record it (age, weight, gender, etc), then drive out to a part of the National Park north of the Mooney Mooney bridge, and release them in the wild.

Like others have said, it was rare for an attack on a human, and what we did was mostly a preventative thing (if one dropped on a car, it could cause a serious accident), and most of the ones we found were generally adventurous babies, so they were smaller and not as violent.

Anyway, the pay was ok (risky work = more money), and fairly rewarding, but I don't think I'd do it again, especially now that I'm a software engineer."

m00nh34d,Games,1390184535.0,"If Valve is in administration, there's no guarantee that will happen. Just because the employees want to ""make things right"", doesn't mean they'll be allowed to. The creditors and administrators might decide that the Steam platform is an asset that could be sold, they'd need to keep the DRM functioning to sell off that asset. No-one would be able to tell who the next owner would be, what they'd do with it, or, if it would even sell. 

If you were to give the creditors and administrators an option, either ""make things right"" for Valve's former customers (ie, us), which would cost Valve money to develop and deploy, or get more money returned to you, I'm pretty sure I know what one they'd go with. Money always wins in these business decisions.

This is, of course, quite a worst case scenario. But I don't think it's out of the realms of possibilities. We've seen a lot of companies fail in the last 10 years, some that would appear to be very solid. We really have no insight into the financial workings of Valve, they're not a public company, I'm reasonably sure they'd be doing pretty well, given the nature of their business, but I've got no way to know for certain (and who's to say external influences don't cause their demise, eg directors siphoning off cash illegally).

Blue Stars have most of their camps in Indiana and so do Scouts. It's all about location. But as far as I know, BAC has been doing it for the longest. 

Additionally, the 7th Regiment and Spartans are both local to Connecticut and New Hampshire respectively. A very feasible drive, especially with the schedules both corps have. From my experience, most kids in the New England area are more interested in the Cadets than any other corps for the most part. Would this change if BAC had more camps in MA? Perhaps.

incogito_ergo,RealEstate,1390185176.0,"No idea what the market there looks like, but $25k is enough to do a single-family deal (my last deal was a total of $15k our of pocket including holding costs, repairs, etc.).  My advice is to join some local real estate investor groups and shadow some more experienced investors on deals.  Read ""The Millionaire Real Estate Investor"" by Gary Keller.  Read everything you can on BiggerPockets.  Really get to understand the numbers (you don't need to be an insane OCD number cruncher like yours truly, but you at least need to understand RE finance to the point where you know you are getting a good deal, have a huge margin of safety, and how various changes in estimated costs/appraisals, etc. alter your returns and exit strategy).

Ideally, find a more experienced investor to mentor you.  

To actually answer your questions:

1) There are always deals in any market.  ""Experts"" generally talk about the US as a whole.  RE is local.  Where I'm at the market is really hot, and it's difficult to find great deals.  The thing about RE, particularly single-family, is that people always need to sell their houses fast.  Divorce, unemployment, whatever.  And a lot of those people treat their houses like shit, to the point where they can't sell them to a conventional buyer, because they don't qualify for conventional financing due to being ""uninhabitable.""  My advice: don't worry about the market, worry about your numbers.  That is the ultimate source of truth.  I say deals are hard to find here because I evaluate 50 wholesale deals that come across my inbox, and none of them meet my buy criteria, wheres 18 months ago maybe 10% of deals were good enough.

2) I do only SFH, because it's easier to get deals.  Mostly when you buy MF, you buy from other investors.  There's definitely money to be made there, but it requires even more knowledge and experience than SFH IMO.  When I have $200k+ to invest at a time, I'll probably move to MF.

3) Having a good agent is very important (you won't always use them, but they can send you deals, provide area-specific expertise, etc., find someone who is a good negotiator).  Have multiple financing guys (hard money and local banks especially).  Property manager, yes.  Mortgage broker.  Wholesalers.  Mentors/other investors. Your network is your most important asset as a real estate investor.

4) 25k is enough to do 1 average SFH deal with a good chunk to spare, or 2 'A-grade' deals in my market today.  YMMV.

5) Run the numbers.  Let the numbers inform your decision (this is incredibly important in REI... emotion will make you broke.  The numbers decide for you).

6) Very hard to find deals on MLS.  Finding deals is generally the hardest part of investing.  Once you do a few deals, people will seek you out to pitch deals to you.  Most of them will suck.  Cultivate relationships with the better wholesalers (this is also where having a good network helps, because everyone who does a lot of business knows everyone else in the local market).

7) Only if you want to be an agent as a source of income.  You can have the agent(s) you work with run comps/CMA for you.  You may need to teach them how.

8) Just use google, you should be able to find at least 2-3 local investment groups in any big city.

Hope that helps."

When you're all buzzed up and it's 105 degrees outside and you've been walking around all day, being able to nap at your campsite, maybe kick it in your car with the AC, is a wonderful thing. They have tents with shade or places to hang out, but they're usually crowded as are places with any amount of shade.

When it comes to day drinking just stay hydrated and taper it off. Shit sucks when your buzz fades away and you're surrounded by heat and loud noise.

Sneaking things in is pretty easy. I carried a lot of stuff by stuffing my waistband or putting it in my bag* with a false bottom. I didn't try to sneak in bottles though so I can't comment.

Scoring is pretty hit or miss. Your best bet at any time of the day is around the Sahara tent, especially when the sun starts to set. Just look for people with fanny packs. I've been offered all sorts of stuff but I always come prepared so it's a non-issue for me.

I highly, highly recommend talking to people around you whether it's at the shuttle stop or walking around. I've met a ton of people from a ton of different places and it's led to some pretty crazy stuff. Highlight of last year was post-Knife Party I was walking to New Order to catch the end of their set and I bummed a cigarette** off some random girl who asked for some of my water. Ended up at her campsite, met all the people she was with, and partied all night.

After the festival closes for the night, I'm pretty sure each zone has a club/place to go where you can hang out. The one by my campsite last year was a little shack that had a DJ. It was pretty cramped and I wasn't totally down with it, but you never know.

Last little tidbit of advice- bring a fucking bandanna. Keeps the sun off your head, sweat out of your eyes, and when it gets dusty you can wrap it around your mouth to filter out some of the shit.

Stay safe, stay hydrated, and have fun!

.* Bring some kind of bag. Don't spend all day carrying around merch/water/whatever and it's an insta-pillow if you find a place to lay down

** If you smoke, you have an excuse to strike up a conversation with any and every smoker at Coachella and it's awesome. If you don't smoke, carry a pack anyways and bum them out"

Nukatha,nintendo,1390185342.0,"I really wish the Wii U actually had an expansion port like the GCN, N64 and SNES.
It makes the idea of a DS player kind of... annoying.
It would have to be a USB expansion thing, or plug into the Gamepad via that mysterious port at the bottom.

Actually, now that I think about it, that's really quite a novel idea: A 3DS player for the Wii U that plugs into the Gamepad would necessarily have the 3DS's innards (The Game Boy Player literally has a GBA without a screen or buttons inside it).

If the processing power of the 3DS could be tapped by the Gamepad, it would reduce the load on the main console, permitting higher quality visuals on each for Wii U games. A 'Gamepad Plus', akin to the Wii Remote Plus, could be released as a stand-alone system... almost."

I have doubts about the article, too, since only one perspective is given. However, I can actually see something like this happening in Quebec. There really are people who speak primarily French but are conversant in English, but when faced with someone who speaks English, will insist on only speaking French and/or pretending to not understand. There are a significant amount of people in Quebec who believe Quebec should separate from the rest of Canada, and there are laws there that significantly limit the use of English in favour of French.

It's also an issue for any pockets of French communities outside of Quebec, although in my personal experience, there isn't much antagonism (for example, I run into a lot of French-speaking patients where I work, even though I live in Ontario, but no one has yet to treat me rudely because I can't speak French, whereas this has definitely happened to me once or twice when I visited Quebec as a tourist).

The language issue is a polarizing one for many Canadians and, sadly, nothing new, stretching all the way back to when the French and English colonized the New World. See /u/carpe_omnium's post for a better explanation."

A Doomsday deck is a special kind of Storm deck, that builds very specific stacks of 5 cards to defeat your opponent.  It's notoriously difficult to play, since it has huge amounts of options whenever you cast Doomsday, and often there's only one correct choice to ensure you win after you cast it.

But, because it has so many answers, a skilled Doomsday player can ensure victory against any opponent (assuming the Doomsday player is also familiar with the opponent's deck or strategy.)"

As with most pets, if you train them from a young age, they will be able to handle other pets/children/chaotic houses, but you also have to remember that they're living beings too (give them a safe place/bed/hidey box/etc). Some just take more training and patience than others."

broken42,Nerf,1390185942.0,"At the very low end, you can get a chest rig with more than enough MOLLE real estate for ~$20. Lets add on to that double stack triple AK mag pouch (enough to hold 6 Nerf mags), another ~$16. Maybe we want a general purpose pouch, carry some darts or misc stuff. We can get a huge general purpose pouch for ~$10. Finally we decided to get a nicety, but by no stretch of the imagine absolutely necessary, and go for a dump pouch. That is another $10. 

That is $56 for enough mag storage to last you an entire day of HvZ, a general purpose pouch that can hold enough darts to fill your mags 3 times over, and a dump pouch. For that $56, you get everything you'd ever need for HvZ when it comes to tactical gear plus a platform that you can change around and add to piecemeal in the future should you decide to change things up. If someone were to get a similar rig/vest that has the pouches sewn in, they are stuck with that setup with no choices in changing things up and the only option of adding new pouches is to buy an entire new vest.

All of these prices are from Evike.com, so they will be cheaper by virtue of the fact that Evike is ALWAYS running coupon codes and you could possible find alternatives cheaper elsewhere.

TL;DR Yes MOLLE might have a slightly higher initial investment, but if you plan on playing for a while then over the long run you will end up spending less money.

And as a note, don't use M4 mag pouches for Nerf. STANAG mags, the mags that M4s use, are much less wide than Nerf Mags."

Even going all the way back to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, [nuclear bombs were equipped with altimeters](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/12/06/trouble-airbursts/), not timers, because the altitude of the blast is pretty important depending on the effect you want to achieve."

TokisCodpieceBZZZ,childfree,1390186185.0,"While I see where everyone in this thread is coming from with the whole ""you should've said no right away,"" I feel like they would've harassed you either way.  When you said you'd think about it, that implied to them that you considered doing it, and therefore can be convinced.  If you'd said no right off, then you're completely selfish and didn't even take your family's feelings into account.  You were screwed either way.

I like the angle some people are taking, where you suggest they adopt and use how much of a difference it made in your life as justification.  Even then, they'll probably throw it in your face: ""Well if we changed your life so much, why won't you do this for us?""

Guglio08,PS4,1390186204.0,"It depends on your console and method of purchase.

If you're buying for PS3 / Xbox 360, it's going to be $19.99 for digital download and $29.99 for physical disc. The PS4 / Xbox One versions are $10 more, so $29.99 for digital and $39.99 for disc.

The reason for the increase in price for PS4 / Xbox One is unknown, although if I were to guess, it's because the Fox Engine was designed for PS3 / Xbox 360, and thus needed more, um, stuff, for the next-gen platforms. An alternate and plausible scenario is that Kojima spent a lot of money on the Fox Engine + MGSV, and so splitting the game up was done to recoup some costs, since The Phantom Pain is still in development."

I don't think most men would be willing to wait a year or more for me to have sex with them or mess around with them.  I also have trouble touching others such as hugs or handshakes.  I do it but I feel really peeved about it.

However, I'm not judgmental about sex.  I don't look down on others for their own interests, number of partners, being polyamorous, for having casual sex or anything like that.

Canadairy,farming,1390186859.0,"OK, here's an example of how most of these videos are made. They'll take the worst isolated incidents over the course of months and present them as everyday on the farm. So if one was made on my farm you'd see:

A calf laying in a pen surrounded by diarrhea. Her name is Biscuit. The part you wouldn't see would be me removing the soiled bedding, replacing it with fresh and coaxing her to drink bottles of water mixed with electrolyte powder.  Today Biscuit is fully recovered and doing great, but that wouldn't be included.
Next, there'd be three heifers standing in a sodden pen with water squishing up around their feet. It would have been taken the morning I came in and found Lady, Natalie, and Kendra had broken a water line and flooded their pen. Not seen would be me promptly moving them to a dry pen, and later cleaning out the flooded pen and fixing the water line. 
This would probably be followed with shots of Nutmeg, Tina, and Nice. These are our oldest cows. All over 12. That's roughly equivalent to a human being over 90. They are very old and they look it. This would be presented as animals mistreated, when really it's animals treated very well so that they got old. There's really nothing we can do with these old girls other than treat them well as long as they live or euthanize them (no one's interested in buying them).

We also desperately need a deep-lying playmaker, our attacks havn't been the same since Beckham and his long balls left. Obviously replacing David Beckham isn't something easily or often done, but we need someone that hit longballs out to our wingers and up to our new target forwards.

Also, the academy. Southern California is and has been a gold mine for talent in all sports, forever, and Galaxy has done a pretty shitty job of signing guys eligible for HGP contracts. Unfortunately San Diego is out of range (&gt;70 miles away from Stubhub Center), but Orange County, all of LA county and the inland empire can and needs to be mined for the ridiculous level of youth talent there.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390187005.0,"My culture clash is mostly traditional values meets American values.  I'm Chinese American, my parents are immigrants...I'm dating a white guy.  With my ex boyfriend, who was Taiwanese American, it was understood that we had to hide our affection (no PDA, lets pretend we have not slept with each other).  But my current boyfriend is white, like 4th generation or more.

So I used to be very wary of staying the night at his place. I don't like the idea of my parents knowing that I stay over there, but of course they have to know that I am...because I still live with one of my uncles.  And everyone in my family talks.  They're very tight knit.  So my mom will scold me for a long while, every now and then, about how I shouldn't be staying over and tempting him with my body.

Because I'm born here in the US, I also think I should move in with my boyfriend before we get married...and we were talking about moving in with each other this year, 2014.  We can't do it due to financial reasons, but my mom is vehemently against it.  Part of it is, she doesn't think he will marry me if we move in together.  Another part of it is, she doesn't want to tell the rest of our family that I've moved in with someone who I'm not married with.  It's a huge taboo for traditional Chinese.  So that's what I struggle with.  I kind of just brush off the scolding, but it does suck to listen to.  And I don't want to ostracize myself from my family - we are all very tight knit and it would be devastating to me if my mom (and consequently the rest of my family) cut me off from communication.  My boyfriend says that is emotional blackmail.  But I know my mom is capable of that - she has held grudges against ex-friends for over 20 years - and I seriously don't want to lose connection to my family.  In my mind, which I understand is a big part of my culture, they have done so much for me....to lose them is to lose everything.  My boyfriend's perspective is that it is not a huge deal.  But I feel like he doesn't understand where I'm coming from on this."

Don't concern yourself with dungeons, especially solo, till you have max  defense. Then you can try snakes and UDLs. The big thing is just learning to wander godlands safely. Then you carefully branch from there and learn other patterns from enemies and dungeons.

finalDraft_v012,AskWomen,1390187342.0,"Because I am in the same boat and have had eye contact issues as well...It is a huge issue!!! It DOES hamper your relationships!! I realized this a few years ago and have actively worked on getting better at eye contact.  To really engage the people you are talking to, ESPECIALLY in professional settings (let alone platonic or romantic!) you seriously have to train yourself to learn to give eye contact.  If it's too hard, try looking at that spot between their eyes instead of directly in to their eyes.  It's okay to look away every now and then, but when it counts in your conversation..look in to their eyes!  A lot of self-help books about small talk that I've read always mention keeping eye contact during conversation.  It is really not just about romantic relationships, this is a skill you need to learn in life.  I'm a freelancer so making connections with people is the difference between not working ever and having a job fairly consistently.  Networking is my lifeblood.  And it sucks because I'm an introvert and this stuff comes hard to me...but it's sink or swim, and this is a skill you need if you want to stay afloat in a bad economy."

Diosjenin,WTF,1390187454.0,"Yelp doesn't ""just provide an outlet"" if they're deliberately suppressing positive reviews and lowering review scores to ""persuade"" business owners to pay them.  IANAL, and I admit it would be a stretch, but I *think* a business could make a libel case against Yelp itself using the following criteria:

1) By deliberately manipulating which reviews are shown and which are not (for reasons other than reviews containing content that is illegal/offensive/against TOS), Yelp does not function as a simple outlet which third parties can use to post opinions, but is effectively making opinion ""statements"" of its own, and therefore its statements can be found libelous.

2) Accepting the definition of ""statement"" above, Yelp's statements are factually incorrect if they do not accurately represent the proportion of positive and negative reviews actually submitted to its site (to a reasonable degree, and again, not illegal/offensive/against TOS).

3) Yelp's statements caused harm if the business' decreasing score over time, introduction of new negative reviews, etc. can be correlated to subsequent drops in customer activity and/or revenue for said business - or (possibly) if a critical mass of the business' competitors, which were unburdened by Yelp's manipulation, showed the opposite trend.

4) Yelp's statements were made *despite* adequate research to the contrary, given that their core function of aggregating individuals' opinions gives them sufficient and unique data on the degree to which a business is liked by its customers and why, which they deliberately chose to ignore."

High school is emotionally difficult for two big reasons: First, you and your cohort will be going through hormone hell; this will make you crazy, and sensitive, and tempted to do stupid things. Second, you're (probably) missing the emotional toolkit to deal with the things that hormone-addled teenagers do to each other in order to jockey for social status.

You'll build that toolkit through experience, patience, and by making mistakes and learning from them. That part of your learning is just as important as the academic side. If you can, don't forsake one for the other -- ""future you"" will be better for it when you get to college."

The reason I cried foul is because you made it sound like Sean Cody went out of their way to hire high school students, like they were passing out flyers saying ""Become a pornstar!"" And you know what, no, it's not beneficial, but it doesn't matter. No porn career is beneficial to any pornstar, especially gay pornstars. When was the last time you heard of a gay pornstar go back into a mainstream job and not have issues? It just happens that he was in a financial situation where he had to do what he had to do. His other options was a retail or food industry job that pays $9 an hour. I know that that kind of pay doesn't pay the bills. I know that he got paid $5000/scene and he made 4 scenes in total. That's enough to get his mom out of the hole and hopefully back on her feet. I'm actually very impressed in how he actually thought about how he could help his mom out, but at the end of the day he had consequences and had to accept them. And honestly he's not your son, you don't know him personally, so why bother? 

&gt; Every other 18 year old has had parents, teachers, or counselors who discussed these things with them and guided them to help decide their path.

Other than telling my parents what I want to do, no. They're not choosing my classes, what school I will go to, or which degree I will get, if that's what you're assuming, because they know it's my education, and I have to be responsible for what I want to be in life.

&gt; You just made up a completely random argument to knock down. I never said any of that at all.

No shit you didn't say any of that. You made it sound like that, so I made a situation to disprove you.

&gt; Gee, I couldn't tell.
I never said that young people are dumb. In fact, if you read some of my previous comments, you'll see that I say the opposite.

Wow, attitude check. True, you didn't called them dumb, but you basically called them ignorant by saying ""not enough experience."" If this was true, then literally a few people would ever find success because they couldn't figure out how to do stuff on their own during college.

&gt; Actually, employers are 100% responsible for choosing who they hire.

Again, you made it sound like Sean Cody actively recruited high schoolers directly. It's all about their brand appeal, they saw he was hot, legal and straight. They gobbled him up regardless of the fact that he went to high school or not.

&gt; But I don't see you engaging in risky behavior. No, you are going to college to study engineering.

I'm not engaging in risky behavior because I'm not their niche market. I have extra melanin, extremely skinny and have an annoying voice. Even if I was their golden ratio, I wouldn't engage in risky behavior because I would have been busy with engineering, a very busy subject. Noel most likely doesn't know what he wants to do in life, but I do. That's the difference.

&gt; So spare me your rants about how you think what Noel is doing is good for him. You don't really think that, you just have a point to prove to yourself: you can make your own choices.

It's not that I think it's good for him, why would I? It's that I think that you should be able to do whatever the fuck you want to do, no matter what others say about it. You're 100% correct in your assumption that I have a point to prove that someone can make their own choices, because it's not anyone's life but theirs. If you mess it up, oh well. You decided your faith, not anyone else. You can't put the blame on Sean Cody, they had models to hire. If they thought it would've been, he would never have been hired in the first place, because that would make themselves look bad. Should he have waited until he graduated, maybe, but I don't see the difference. He would still be young and inexperienced, as you say.

At this point, it's way too early to know what will happen to Noel, but I hope that he can go back to school and finish. He should never have been suspended in the first place, because it wasn't the school's place to do that. But in saying that, as long as it is legal and no one is getting harmed, it should be no one's problem but his."

One of his biggest points in regards to the Hobbit movies is that everyone will say ""Well [such-and-such] didn't happen in the books, ergo it is awful."" It bugs him so much because *that's not criticism*, it's comparison with judgment attached. If you can say ""They changed X, and that changed this other character in a certain way that makes their arc make less sense"" then that's criticism. But just ""they changed it ergo suck"" is terrible criticism.

As a huge GRRM and JRRT fan/nerd, I've had to keep this in the forefront of my mind when criticizing these works. Weirdly, it's made me appreciate GOT and the Hobbit films more, as their changes largely serve thematic consistency and narrative tightening purposes, while forcing me to admit the serious flaws in the LOTR movies, where most of the changes drastically undermined certain characters and moments."

Nice is no longer not being a jerk. It's just... being there. But if it's what they hear all the time, they read into it; becoming 'nice guys'. This is not to say that they have no personality to begin with, but more that they alienate people enough early on by asking for too much too quickly from people, so they never get any substantial external analysis until they decide to take on the nice guy persona."

There is a company that came out with simulated mother-daughter sex, but the performers come out before each scene to explain that they're really not mother and daughter. Back in the 70's, before [Traci Lords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traci_Lords) almost brought down the whole porn industry, there was incest porn all over the place, real and simulated, and even with identical twin sisters getting it on with each other. After Traci Lords, the porn industry was terrified that obscenity laws would tighten across the country, so they began to self-regulate their content. Besides children and animals (which are both illegal, for obvious reasons), simulated rape and incest are the two lines you don't cross in the industry. Distributers won't go anywhere near your title, and if you get hit with an obscenity charge, the industry won't back you up. The case of [Rob Black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Zicari) is a perfect example of this.

Best advice I could give is know where the pit is gonna be, you can usually tell when the openers are playing. You can see the guys getting them selves loose and pumped up also you'll notice it's the only spot people aren't packed in like sardines.

Very understandable, and a very good observation;  and I think this lies at the heart of a lot of this.  I also think there's possibly a little ego tied up in this too - people don't want to be laughed at for buying a console that fails.

Thing is, the Dreamcast was a phenomenal machine with some brilliant titles, and everyone who owed it got a lot of pleasure from it.  I don't see why that's not enough?  I'm enjoying the hell out of my WiiU and if it becomes an under-appreciated footnote in history that does not affect my enjoyment.

we are looking at two *very* different situations here.  Sega had a very wonky stable of in-house titles and teams, as well as no particular core vision or quality-control related top that.

On the other side, men and women get angry or jealous over the ""no weight gain"" thing, but they don't understand how frustrating or depressing it can be.

My fashion choices are largely limited to what I can actually wear. Shirts need to be large or XL just so they can fit my arms, even though they are baggy for my body. Pants are even worse. I wear jeans 90% of the winter (which is like 5-6 months here in Canada), but dress pants work in the other seasons.

I overheard a ham-cousin, who was notorious for being cheap and exploitative plotting to 'help' take leftovers to my grandmother's house then leave half of it in the car (it was December so nothing would have spoiled [not that that would have stopped her]) so she wouldn't have to buy groceries for a couple days (there was literally a 10 metre table filled with food as my grandmother's church group made way more than was needed and kept bringing more and more food out as things got eaten).  
My father was a retired police officer and my uncle was a civilian worker at a local military base so my uncle's funeral had a sort of honour guard made up of off duty police officers and soldiers. As things were wrapping up, I enlisted and directed the honour guard to load the leftovers into several vehicles, purposely placing the veggie trays and various tossed salads in HC's car.

steve496,49ers,1390188516.0,"1) I agree, we don't want to go in to next year with Crabtree and Patton as our only starting-caliber receivers.  We need at least one, and preferably two, more receivers that can get open.  Problem is, we also need at least one, and preferably 2, starting-caliber CBs, and (depending on what happens with Whitner) possibly a safety as well.  Will be interesting to see how Baalke prioritizes things over the offseason.

2) What part of what happened this game - or heck, in general - can you blame on Roman?  I mean, we don't have the world's most explosive offense, it's true, but for all the Roman hate around here I don't know that there's any particular reason to believe its his fault.

3) I don't think the problem is so much accuracy or even game management as vision.

TotallyUnqualified,casualiama,1390188527.0,"This statement is inaccurate. First of all, the reason many 401(k)s are better than any IRA is that the employer that offers the 401(k) may offer some sort of match on your contribution. This is free money, and you are foolish if you don't contribute enough to max out said match (assuming doing so won't cause you to starve).

Both account types refer to the tax-ability of the investment, and are typically invested in one or mutual funds in stocks, bonds, and/or some sort of cash equivalent.

There are more options for IRAs, since you're not at the mercy of your employer, but the ""I"" stands for ""individual"", which means you don't have the option to negotiate for the less expensive share classes that a 401(k) can get (in a decent one).

rising_son,Guitar,1390188621.0,"I don't have the Ditto Looper specifically (I have a Boss looper).

I use mine in various ways, I have it always on, and it is last in my pedal chain. 

The first and most obvious way I use it is to record riffs into it and set them to loop, not necessarily always my own riffs, but I always try to come up with my own every day. Once I have recorded one I loop it and just start improvising over it.

Second way I use it is to record things for my own reference. If I come up with a new lead line or lick or something, and it is too complicated to remember if I go to GuitarPro to tab it, I'll record it into the looper first and save it so I can listen to it again later to transcribe it.

Thrid way I use it is for testing out harmony parts for leads/melodies/solos etc. Come up with a line, record it in, and play over it to either work out a harmony, or check one that I have already written for it.

This works for be because the Boss RC-30 (one I use) has loads of memory banks, so I can store pretty much everything I want in it for later. I can record a riff one time, and come back the next day and I will have fresh ideas for it, which leads me onto yet more recordings with it.

I understand the Ditto looper is much simpler in operation, I don't know if it has actual memory banks like other loopers which may limit it to the more ""spontaneous"" uses like jamming riffs and solo'ing over them. I got the RC-30 because it does all the looping functions but serves as a recording device as well, and it is easier to jam ideas into it than hook up my microphone and recording interface every time I have a cool idea.

I don't think there is any secret to using it, just try and be creative with it as best you can. When you ask if there are any exercises for it, I think you are looking at it the wrong way. It is a tool for those who come up with their own musical ideas and want to experiment with them in real time. 

If you are struggling to come up with ideas, perhaps you should just concentrate on other areas of learning, and keep it just sitting there for those moments of inspiration. Do not try to force yourself to use it, just let ideas come to you naturally. If you find that you aren't very inspired, just work on understanding the kind of music you like, so your musicality improves. If you aren't ""hearing"" things in your head that are your own ideas, it will be hard for a Looper to help you much in your practice.

I hope this is helpful to you in some way."

I_RAPE_MY_SLAVES,Games,1390188653.0,"I'm a little biased since I dislike multiplayer in any capacity, but co-op ES/FO seems like it would be pretty awkward in practice. So much of the game is effectively paused as you loot enemies, equip/unequip weapons, and craft/repair items, not to mention the constant saving/reloading that a lot of players engage in. With Fallout, handling the bullet-time of VATS while everyone else is moving at full speed would also be weird.

The gameplay is cool because it allows a variety of play styles, from people who treat it like a twitch shooter to people who treat it like a near-turn based RPG. Co-op would only cater to the former, which would reduce a lot of the appeal.

It does seem kind of fun if it could be something someone could seamlessly drop in and out of, like if a friend in the same room could take over a companion character and leave whenever they wanted, but the games don't really lend themselves to two independent ""main"" characters or brief, casual drop-ins."

GentlemanBAMF,LeagueofLegendsMeta,1390188867.0,"Swain. Free damage amplification, deceptive sustain and two CCs with free mana in his kit makes him a versatile champion with quite a few options.

Taking him mid as a melt-mage (Haunting Guise into DFG is my favorite) followed up with tanky items (Zhonya's and SV) makes him a terror by the mid game. He becomes one of the best baits in the game and with the two defensive items can really deceive teamfight focus. Taking him top is even more fun, as most of the tanky meta underestimates his damage amplification, plus he gets the inherent bonus of being ranged in a predominantly melee lane.

Beyond that, he's one of the few mages that benefits from investing in tank stats, which frees up either your jungler or other solo laner to focus on some damage as well. I've combo'd him to great success with a jungler Malzahar and Evelynn.

Of course, most people will complain about his mobility drawback and lack of burst. He's not your typical pick these days, but he's ferocious when played properly and can lane bully extremely well. Plus, Tyrant Swain is a sick as fuck skin."

I kind of assume that the 49ers were less quick to jump on top of their obviously-injured teammate when he obviously already had the ball.

To be clear, that didn't change the outcome of the game - we got the ball (and an extra 15 yards of field position) on the next play anyway - but it was still a pretty egregious oversight by the refs."

Besides, how is anyone going to change any perspectives if they only stick to people who have experienced exactly the same thing as them all of the time?

You're not. You've been completely forward with him and he has nobody to blame but himself. He may always act like this and there's probably not much you can do. The question you have to ask yourself is if the value he provides as a friend outweighs the outbursts he has on occasion. 

You also have to ask if you're doing him more harm than good by continuing to be his friend. Your fear of losing a best friend is something you shouldn't consider. If, as one of his best friends, you believe the relationship you have with him is hurting him, than you need to distance yourself.

mike5f4,short,1390189239.0,"This is how I see bioengineer in the future. Eventually births will be engineered to satisfy the couples, over time the state will ration the births in number. Further down the road all human life will be done outside the womb for the convenience of women. Sexual desire will no longer at some point be considered a desirable trait for humans as it does not create a good productive and obedient trait that is useful for society. Things like physical attractiveness will serve no purpose and bigger bodies will be seen as a waste of resources. Things like brain capacity will be the most important to keep the society going. The masses will have been weeded out through disease and famine sense society will not have the resources to adequately feed and immunizes the larger and poorer classes.

It always fascinates me how people don't understand that the world of the future that many invasion may not be set up to make the individual happy and reap profits. Technology that always improves would eventually make the human as he exists today obsolete, and primitive desires would at that point no longer be seen as having any positive qualities.

If we are to continue seeing humans as a product to be improved upon by genetic engineering we will lose our humanity forever."

I would image it is most useful against a tutor heavy meta (only kinda counting land tutors), so black decks.  There were a few white ones, and a couple green creature ones.  

I think it would be most effective against a tutor general or a black deck, maybe green if they run a lot of land ramp.

But the ""count the shuffles"" I wouldn't really include the first 5 turns or so of people burning all their ramp spells, and then they won't hit anymore ramp except for every 10 cards or so.  Especially if they play partial paris mulligans and people mulligan to 3 lands and 4 of their 10 ramp spells in their deck.

I_RAPE_MY_SLAVES,Games,1390189568.0,"With video games, a huge part of the hype/hate cycle is also that some games appear to have a lot more depth than they eventually do. As people put more than the first ten or twenty hours into a game, a lot of irksome qualities become apparent. A story that seems very open the first time around might become very clearly on-rails the second time around, or the dynamic quests become repetitive and formulaic, or the oh-so-immersive in-game radio only plays the same six songs.

It doesn't seem bad in the strictest sense, since a game that can deliver twenty hours of a fantastic experience is still providing entertainment, but with games that bill themselves on being able to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay, I'm not going to write the critics off as complainers."

Luckily, now that I'm out of college, most guys I meet who watch anime are NOT of the weaboo kind.  Which is awesome.  For a lot of the guys I meet now, I would never have guessed they like anime....and I like that.  I like that it doesn't rule their life in a way that they artificially delude themselves into thinking they're experts on Japanese culture/language.  Especially because I fully threw myself in to Japanese language learning during high school and I can tell if you dont' have a grasp of the language.  So....you don't have to hold back per se...enthusiasm is not a bad thing.  If you are a weaboo about it, there is little you can do to hide that.  If you are a normal fan who genuinely loves the medium for the awesome stuff it can contribute to the world of entertainment...trust me...that shows through in your attitude.  You will be okay.  I do support not advertising right off the bat that you are a huge anime fan, but if it comes up in conversation then it is totally fine.  I'd say even encouraged, because it shows you have hobbies. Don't feel bad about it :)"

If you picked up the game as soon as it came out, and instantly got all the best stuff to make training the fastest in all cases, and never missed a training queue... you still wouldn't have all the skills in the game maxed out.

You can still end up being the best at something over someone else, even if that person has been playing longer.

The stories of it being a hard game to get into are probably from at least a couple years ago. I started playing near when it came out (off and on since then), and recently rolled up a new character to check out the noob stuff. Massive improvements.

That and they took up half the garage.  No joke, my entire truck-bed was filled with boxes of porn today.  This dumpster was empty when we started and the photo was taken about half-way through. My 40 y/o friend kept saying things like, ""Man, I knew these girls when they were young and this was the moment their career was ruined"".  The entire collection was staggering in that 95% of them were pretty mint, some in the original subscription covers.  I think some of us can relate to deleting 4 gigs of porn, but this was something tangible and I knew that with every toss in to the dumpster we were literally throwing away money.  But I think we made the right choice.  No amount of money is worth ruining a marriage or relationship.  When we were about to leave, the father-in-law literally started to cry and thanked us saying, ""I love you guys!""

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390189746.0,"Oh, man, you poor honey!  That band is soooo big for you!  I tell ya, mainstream lingerie sellers have a lot to answer for.  

 You will probably be more comfortable in a 30 band, as your ribs don't have a lot of squish, your snug is above 28, and you don't need a lot of support.  I'd start with a size of 30B/C, with a 28C/D in bands that run extra stretchy.  Don't rule out all underwires yet, it's going to hurt a whole lot in a band 6 or 7 inches too big, but when it fits right, it shapes and supports everything comfortably.  You don't necessarily need it, but you might find that you like it, and it's a lot easier to find good bras with it than without it.

I don't think I have any specific recommendations for your size range.  It's worth checking out the Little Bra Company, although they run small, so you'll want at least a 30C, and perhaps Cleo Maddie in 30D, as it runs pretty much a full cup small.  Bestey Johnson and Natori also make some offerings in your size. Hopefully someone in your range can chime in and make some more specific suggestions.

Ninja Edit:  Freya Deco Soft Cup might work, although I think it's cut a little fuller on top. I believe it's stretchy, so probably 28C."

mhblm,AskWomen,1390189818.0,"&gt;Well, since cattiness isn't directed at men,

Whoa whoa, you just lost me. I've totally been on the receiving end of cattiness. Hasn't everyone?  I mostly think of cattiness as being two-faced, keeping a friendly face but tearing others down for social points when their back is turned. Surreptitiously putting down others for social gain.

Again, this is why I was astounded. I've never considered cattiness to be directed at women, so it was never a gender issue."

They are my favorite, and I can't tell you how many recent immigrants I know who use Radiolab as a fun way to learn English.  I remember one in particular told me how she used to fall asleep to Radiolab when she didn't know English well....and once she started understanding better, she would find herself staying up late at night to finish the episode...because it is SO engaging.

The issue with Cass is that she has an incredibly high skill cap, and if you miss with your q or w because they dodge it and you fired off twin fangs before you register, then it goes straight on the full cd and usually loses any all'in. Also her ultimate is short range with a fairly noticable windup, so at the higher levels where players have the ability to play her incredibly well, the stun on her ultimate becomes relatively unreliable as your opponents typically have time to turn away or otherwise evade it."

Sahasrahla,fantasywriters,1390190338.0,"Thanks for sharing and congratulations on starting something. It might not seem like much, but that first step where you actual start working on an idea instead of just thinking about it can be one of the hardest. 

As for what you've written, the most important thing to remember here is that this is the beginning of the story. It's what readers, agents, editors and anyone else who picks up your novel will read first. The writing here has to draw the reader into the story and make them want to continue. If you don't engage the reader quickly enough they'll decide your story isn't for them and put it down. 

With that in mind, let's look at what you posted:

&gt; It was an exceptionally cold evening. However, it wasn't anything Len wasn't used to, having spent all his life on this forsaken glacier. Snowflakes were falling slow and steady; God was being generous today. Hiding behind the tip of a snow dune, Len was careful not to be seen as he observed a group of people trecking in the snow far ahead of him.

The part here that could draw a reader in is Len tracking a group of people. That works because it sets up some questions in the reader's mind. Who's he tracking? Why's he tracking them? Who's the good guy and bad guy here? Is there a good guy and bad guy? 

You opened with setting, which could be alright, but the imagery would really have to stand out for that to work. If you go that route, think what emotions you're trying to get your reader to feel. You're setting them up on top of a glacier, should they feel isolated? Like they're being hunted? Like they're the hunters? And they should feel cold, don't let the reader forget that. Right now it wouldn't be that much work to switch out snow for sand and put everyone in a desert instead. 

Also, bonus points if you can tie your opening line in with the plot, theme, and general atmosphere of the rest of the novel. 

&gt; It had been two days since he began shadowing the group, and finally there was about to be an opening. They were entering a glomper's territory. Flat as a matress; it lurked somewhere beneath the undisturbed snow, waiting for its prey.

&gt; ...

We get a few paragraphs of exposition. We get an explanation of glompers, a description of the group, an introduction and explanation of Aura, and something about Len's father. 

Remember, you're still trying to draw the reader in. Is there anything here that might do that? We see the group, but there's nothing particularly interesting about them. They have something called a boduch, which for all I know could be a furry donkey or a wooly mammoth (sidenote: don't introduce made up animals too quickly, it serves no purpose here except to confuse the reader). Glompers could be neat, but perhaps their introduction could wait until one jumps out. Introducing Aura is good, but less is more here; keep her a bit mysterious at this point. 

Really all we *need* to know here is something that makes us interested in the group and perhaps tantalises the reader with a hint about Len's motivations. 

&gt; Yells started to echo from below. ...

A long action sequence follows. Not much else happens here. I mean, things *do* happen, but not much relevant to the story (characterization, plot development, setting up mysteries in the reader's mind, etc.) aside from Len killing a bunch of people for their supplies. 

This is risky. The only thing keeping the reader interested at this point is how well you write the action. Considering that not much has been done so far to get the reader invested in the story, they might just become disinterested no matter how exciting the action is. 

&gt; ""Wh- who are you?"" The man asked in a frightful tone. ""Why would you do this?""

&gt; ""I needed supplies,"" Len answered. ""Don't worry, God will give you happiness after you die. I am, however, truly sorry about the pain and stress I have caused you.""

After the action sequence we get some characterization for Len. Personally, I feel it's a bit heavy handed to just have your character introduce this zealotry (beyond just thanking God earlier; doesn't take a zealot to do that) by having him outright state, ""Hey, it's cool to kill you because of God, no hard feelings."" 

&gt; ""You... monster! You disgusting lunatic!"" The man yelled as a mix of spit and blood fell from his mouth. ""Do you know what you have done, murderer?! We were on an important mission. I hope you realize you might have doomed the entire world!""

And here's the plot. Up until this point, as far as the reader knew, nothing much was at stake. It just read like a bandit attacking some hapless travelers. To keep the reader interested you should have had some hint or indication that there was more than meets the eye. Of course, this being a story we probably suspected that anyway, but assuming a story has a plot isn't enough to make the reader care. 

Also, you shouldn't just have a character blatantly state the plot. Give the reader some clues that, hey, maybe something is wrong here, rather than just having a character literally say "" ... you might have doomed the entire world!"" Make sure as well to move those clues up in the narrative so that it feels like the fight scene has some meaning. 

In summary, you want to draw the reader in quickly, so you need to give them something to be interested in. Make them care about the character, give them some evocative imagery, get them asking questions they care about the answers to, and really show off your writing style and voice so they know what they're getting for the rest of the novel. 

That being said, this is just a first draft. Don't worry about this too much and just use it as a starting point to keep writing. In any case, you might find when you go back to do revisions that there's an even better place in the narrative to start your story. Good luck!

I would say it is rather rude of her to do this, and again, even if she brought a platonic friend I don't thnk that is cool.

poop_dawg,SubredditDrama,1390190551.0,"It makes me so mad how the majority of the user base on Reddit does NOT understand what a real feminist is. All they understand is ""feminazi"" and straw feminists.

fem·i·nism
ˈfeməˌnizəm/
noun
noun: feminism

    1. the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of political, social, and economic equality to men.

That's literally all feminism is. Anyone spouting misandry/hatred of men is clearly promoting some other fucked up agenda, and if they label it as ""feminism"" then they don't understand feminism any better than your basic redditor. They also make real feminists look bad, which sucks.

edit: downvoters, who I'm assuming are the ""feminist haters"" - I hope you understand that I hate the same thing you hate but you aren't accurately labeling the misandrists. What I'm essentially saying here is that a true feminist wouldn't be a misandrist, and misandrists suck ass."

DeliciousPumpkinPie,eldertrees,1390190556.0,"Well, you asked a lot of questions, not just one.  But I'll take a stab at it.

&gt; Are there different parts of the plant that not only typically taste different, but have a different high?

Absolutely.  Generally, you would only concern yourself with the buds, but you can certainly still smoke the leaves, and the stem, and probably even the roots too if you dried them out.  These other parts of the plant typically have a *very* different selection of cannabinoids and other phytochemicals, and are generally less useful in terms of effects.

As well, different parts of the same bud can have similarly different ratios of cannabinoids, and thus produce a slightly different effect profile.

&gt; Is this the case with MJ? If you get the top part of the flower, does it hit harder? Smoke heavier?

My experience with the plant has not really shown this to be true.  As I said above, sometimes different parts of the same bud (usually a really big bud) can have slightly different effects, but they're still mostly equal in terms of potency.  That being said, the flowers will most definitely hit harder than any other part of the plant.

&gt; Are there different aspects of the plant that affect you differently?

Pretty much answered this, short answer is yes.

&gt; If, hypothetically, I was able to ask my local source for just one part of the plant?

Depends on who your ""local source"" is.  If it's someone who grows, you can ask them for whatever part of the plant you like.  They might decide to sell you a bag of all bud tips, which might be a bit pricier because it would involve cutting the tops off perfectly good buds, which would then sell for less than usual.  I certainly hope your source hasn't been giving you just leaf; if that's not what you meant then that's fine.

Definitely read up on this stuff.  [Erowid](http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis.shtml) is a good place to start.  Good luck!"

Is it less OP than a cookie cutter MFR/railcraft biofuel -&gt; steam setup?  Certainly.  Does it produce a useful amount of power while being infinitely easier to get going with than Reactorcraft or IC2's reactor?  Definitely.

I don't have my server handy, but from recollection I started with a 5x5x7 water filled reactor, and it produced something like 180 RF/t, which seemed decently balanced for a fairly cheap multiblock structure running on an essentially non-renewable fuel; it's about what I'd get from 2 TE dynamos, and building and finding the fuel for a 2 TE dynamos is not a hard challenge (again, depending on the mods you use).

And I certainly wouldn't say that it's ""enough power to last me forever"".  Then again, I'm working towards getting a fully powered MFR laser drill, which I believe requires um...  something like 20k RF/t, which means my dinky little reactor gets me less than 1% of the way there.  Then again, if your ambitions are more limited, 180 RF/t is probably plenty.  :)

For example, they have enacted rules regarding fights such as your jersey must be tied down before starting a fight or the instigator of a fight must remove their helmet if they are wearing a visor. These are little things that increase player safety in a fight, without actually banning fighting.

Also note that there is actually a rather big debate raging in the NHL community about whether fighting should be allowed. It's really a misconception that it is a thing that is ""condoned"". It isn't. It's treated as part of the game, but it isn't really something NHL execs would love to keep in the game.

Honestly it isn't as hard as it seems, the worst thing that can happen (apart from burning your guitar if you are careless) is that you wire the ground wire the wrong way. Carefully looking at the diagram and just taking your time will avoid this from happening. If you don't feel confident doing it take it to a store to be done for you, however it really is NOT difficult if you think over things carefully, and follow the wiring diagram.

The wiring varies for different pickups and switching configurations, and some need to be wired differently when paired with hotter pickups or when you have humbucking and singlecoils in the same guitar.

steve496,49ers,1390190785.0,"I don't think Kap is a terrible QB - the low completion rate is a side effect of a more downfield passing game than we played with Alex Smith - hence the higher YPA despite the lower completion percentage.

That said: I do think Kap could get better at checking down.  Shorter, higher-percentage passes tend to sustain drives better, and there are definitely times we've left plays on the field when there was someone wide open on a short route.  One of the announcers during the Broncos game commented on how Manning was always happy to take the short dump-off to his RB out of the backfield the moment it was open, and that's something you just never see Kap do.

In terms of rushing stats, scanning down [this list](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/rushing/sort/rushingYards/seasontype/2) for QBs turns up the top 5 as:

* Newton, 111 runs, 585 yards, 5.3 average.

**2. I Like You** I heard this first on a live performance and liked it instantly.  I still really like it; my second favorite on the mini.  4.5/5

**3. Girls Girls Girls** Whose decision was it to promote this song?  Nothing wrong with a laidback song (and I'm going to compare it to Joah just because- Joah had an interesting composition and didn't stay at the same level throughout the entire song), but this was just a poorly done one.  I think I might have a personal vendetta against this song, because I actually like this group and it does very little to show their true potential.  2/5

**4. Like Oh** My favorite song, hands down.  Would have been a better track to officially promote if they toned down the autotune a bit.  5/5

**5. Follow Me** This song is a little...young sounding.  It reminds me that most of these guys are like 16.  3.5/5

**6. Playground** Good choice to end the mini, but it's not my favorite- there's a lot of unneeded autotune and you really notice it with earphones on.  3.5/5

3.8/5!  Not too shabby for a debut album, but not great- but I haven't really loved a debut album since Lim Kim's A Voice.  Pretty much every track is better than ""Girls Girls Girls"" (they love me but we're still boring as hell).  

Positive things: the rappers are alright.  JYPent has usually had subpar rappers (even my favorite member of the Wonder Girls, Yubin, is not a good rapper and the less I say about Taecyeon the better)...but GOT7 is an exception.  I enjoyed all the rap breaks, even on Girls Girls Girls, which is why I didn't give that song a 1/5.

1. Use beef or chicken stock and NOT WATER in the crock pot. 

2. Season and flour beef, then sear it in a frying pan before putting it in the crock pot. Adds lots of flavor. 

3. Making Gravy- Make a roux first by mixing equal parts butter and flour in a saucepan. You can keep cooking the roux to get blonde or brown, just google it for instructions. Add some of the juices from the crock pot and reduce. Wine is a good additive, or Milk for a creamier gravy. Season to taste and reduce to desired consistency.

Then it means absolutely nothing when you're talking about being at the bottom of the rap game, because everyone starts that way.  Its like saying everyone can't read when they are born, who gives a shit.

&gt;the bottom in terms of fame, he's not lying

He absolutely is.  How many people find fame when they are still in high school.  GTFO.  There are better actors, rapper, singers , entertainers that have struggled for much longer through most of their careers and have never found fame.  He never fucking struggled when it comes to fame.

Again that's arguable. If you had a bunch of family and friends in the entertainment industry that could open doors for you.. you have a much higher probability of becoming successful in that industry.

Also, though your price breakdown includes some of the cost associated with having employees and warehousing (stocking), it neglects certain other routine expenses a company would incur - paying off mortgages, other interest, etc.  As well as the fact that all these companies sell their stuff to a wholesaler who sells it to Amazon who sells it to us.  So if Amazon is getting $95, maybe they spend $75 and the wholesaler spends $60.  The apparent difference in markup is a $45 item becomes $95, but the manufacturer is only reaping $15 profit from that $95 sale.

andjok,Anarcho_Capitalism,1390191040.0,"It's noteworthy that part of the argument is that it's coercive because the capitalist can order workers around and deny them the means to provide for themselves if they refuse to obey.  It's not so much that the capitalist puts the worker in their position, but that they take advantage of the position of the worker and that is often an unequal relationship.

To see their point of view, imagine that a person is drowning and somebody asks the drowning person to give them their life savings in order to be saved.  The rescuer did not cause the person to drown but they are taking advantage.  Now, I think that's kind of a ridiculous scenario but that's how they think.

To be fair, there is some truth to the argument.  The fewer choices someone has to survive, the easier it is to ""exploit"" them and make them do things they might not do if they weren't desperate.  It's simply more appropriate, in my opinion, to blame the state and not individual capitalists (unless the capitalist is also colluding with the state and not simply benefiting from its policies)."

I think an INTJ's happiness is very closesly related to this concept of depressive realism because although we might acknowledge it's (the happiness's) existence/appearance/presence, we don't necessarily experience that euphoria (very theatrical term for what I'm trying to describe) that others tend to experience when they think they're feeling happy. Because we react to happiness differently to others, we don't tend to realise that it is happiness -- it just isn't exhibited in a way others tend to exhibit it. We tend to internalise more than express/exhibit.

thekingsdaughter,writing,1390191316.0,"There are a lot of questions you need to answer and details to fill in about your characters.

Are they on birth control and lost their pack? If so... their period may not come (which happens when women go off bc, sometimes it takes the body a few months to naturally start up again) and some women are on BC not to prevent pregnancy but because their hormones are out of balance without it. For instance, a girl who is proscribed bc for hormonal regulation (and this is a big percentage of women, something like 60% take bc for hormone regulation not birth control) could have a number of different reactions, reactions that might cleverly demonstrate the difference of living in a society with people and living in the wild. 



     Symptoms could include something light-
 like general moodiness, like if someone woke you up from the best dream of your life to take you to church at 5am. Pain and cramping can be moderate but overly tolerable but sometimes, for women who take bc to avoid cramps, horribly disabling. It can feel like someone put hot concrete in your lower stomach and sometimes it makes your legs feel extremely agitated, like if they were hooked up to electrodes and you could NEVER get comfortable. 

Sometimes, and this is a tolerable pain you can still work with, you can actually feel the lining of your uterus swell up.  Its very irritating, PMS isn't always about being hormonally moody, sometimes the pain is just so irritating that stupid questions exacerbate your general discomfort and you end up snapping at someone so they leave you the fuck alone to deal with the pain.  

Other times, you actually know you're being hormonally sad. You feel so depressed. Someone could say ""I love you"" and you just think about how that beautiful soul, the product of 6 billion years of evolution will one day perish and its heartbreaking so you cry. And then its funny becaus you know you're only crying because of your hormones. Then you're having feelings on top of feelings on top of feelings about your feelings. 


The most annoying symptom of menstruation is the irritability. Every once in a while, you're just so tired from the lining of your uterus ripping itself out and clotting out your vag that you just want to sleep but you can't because you have work to do. I think this is where the cravings come in because the body (men too) naturally craves sweet foood for the sugar when its tired.  

Depending on the women, unless they're very stupid, they probably brought tampons with them. At least one.  Sometimes they're leftover in your old bag from that time 6 years ago when you flew to Arizona and never emptied your suitcase or maybe you put some in your bag because you wanted to have something in case *some other* lady needed it. Like the way old grandmas have aspirin in their purse even when they don't have a headache.  


Finally, this whole thing could be very simple. If you were bleeding in the woods, what would you do? Would you use an old t-shirt to stop the blood? Would you wash in a stream? If the girls are stranded they have the same amount of ingenuity you do for stopping blood.   "

I've been seeing the same eye doctor since I was 4 months old and wearing glasses since I was 18 months. My eye only crosses when I'm trying to focus without corrective lenses (contacts or glasses) fortunately my default is straight since I have never known life without glasses or contacts. When I am not wearing glasses or contacts,  the world is blurry as it is for anyone with astigmatism, but for me, I can see quite clearly if I cross my eyes (it try to focus as my brain interprets it). What happens is my left eye points towards my nose and my right eye turns on, so to speak. This was an issue when I was a kid watching cartoons as I didn't have the energy to put on pants or my glasses. My mom would regularly say ""go get your eyes"" (she always called my glasses my eyes when I was a kid).

The main issue with my eyes is when I move them when they are crossed (say if my move my right eye left, towards my nose and the direction of my crossed eye) then I see double. Whatever I'm looking at has a duplicate beside it that's distance varies depending on how far I move my eye left.

I was playing around with it tonight and wound up with [this](http://i.imgur.com/UdTvYPD.jpg). I know the colors and stuff are a little off - I didn't spend much time editing it, but the main issue is that towards the end of the exposure, I have to unplug the timer remote to get the shutter to close, which obviously makes the camera shake, and makes the image blur a little bit (it was way more pronounced in some of the other ones, this was the best out of ~20 shots). I shorted the contacts on the jack with a pair of pliers to make sure it's doing what it should be, and that both opens and closes the shutter just fine, so it seems to be an issue with the remote.

ep0k,whowouldwin,1390191799.0,"Lets assume your gunman is an infantryman with a reasonable combat loadout for foot patrol. He has an assault rifle chambered in 5.56 NATO, 4x 30 round mags, body armor rated for one 7.62x39mm impact, a helmet with night-vision optics mounted, emergency medical kit with quickclot and a tourniquet, field rations, a map and a compass. He has a reasonable level of skill for a junior-enlisted member of the military and is trained and proficient with his weapon system and basic SERE. We will call him Private Snuffy.

One on one any generic member of the mortal races is unlikely to survive first contact without mithril armor. So hobbits, orcs, goblins, dwarves, humans will not fare well. Dwarves and orcs have better odds due to their intrinsic toughness, requiring PVT Snuffy to employ more precise shot placement that he may not be able to manage under stress.

Elves and human rangers, with their advanced fieldcraft, marksmanship, stealthiness and tracking abilities fare better but need to ambush Snuffy as it will be easier for him to achieve firepower superiority in a stand-up fight. If Snuffy is ambushed in the woods, characters like Legolas and Aragorn have a definite advantage due to their training and experience. Snuffy's night vision optics mitigate their ability to hide to some extent but they probably prevail unless he is able to take the initiative, move to contact and flush them from cover. His opponents must concentrate on using cover and concealment to avoid entering his sight picture, and simultaneously get an arrow into the weak points in his body armor (neck, femoral artery or under the arms).

The Uruk-hai lack all of the finesse this approach requires but would probably be able to close the distance and kill him before he is able to inflict a mortal wound / before they succumb to their wounds unless engaged at range from elevation in open terrain. If Snuffy can ambush a Uruk-hai or corral him into a situation with limited mobility, he has good odds.

Without the use of explosives, trolls steamroll Snuffy. Small arms fire doesn't even phase them. Similar for Shelob and most of the other megafauna that inhabits middle earth (worgs, mumakil, dragons especially, eagles to a lesser extent), supernatural humanoids (vampires, werewolves) and other mythical creatures (ents, huorns).

Advanced magic users and celestial beings, good or evil, are right off the table. Ringwraiths, wizards, barrow-wights, balrogs all destroy him utterly in any number of hideous ways. Gandalf would probably choose to disarm him either through illusion or non-lethal means. Tom Bombadil ignores him or invites him in for a hot meal and an eyeful of his wife.

So on a good day with prep PVT Snuffy will almost certainly prevail over a hobbit, has very good odds against a human or goblin, has decent odds against dwarves and orcs, will almost certainly lose to an elf, has basically no chance against a couple of the more noteworthy wilderness survivors, might be able to take a uruk-hai under the right conditions, and is otherwise fucked.

rising_son,Guitar,1390191809.0,"I haven't tried Bareknuckle pickups at all, so cannot comment directly on those.

As for DiMarzio, I have their pickups in 3 of my guitars. I have a set of Cruisers in an Ibanez RG guitar which are really good ""all rounder"" rail style humbuckers. I have a set of Area 61's in a Strat which are great too, great tone and very noiseless. Got a Telecaster with a Fast Track (again, stacked ""singlecoil sized"" rail humbucker) which is like a Cruiser but more top end. It is really bright and punchy. Tele neck is a Twang King, really snappy, full sounding neck pickup, very dynamic.

I can't really speak for their full sized humbuckers as I don't have any of them in my guitars, but their quality overall is very consistent. I have 4 different kinds of their pickups and am satisfied with all of them, so they must be doing something right.

I reckon you are best to go with regular full sized humbuckers for your style of playing though, I reckon the ""rail"" humbuckers won't sound thick enough for you, perhaps only in the middle position (if you have middle pickups in your guitar).

My best advice is to scour youtube for someone who plays the pickups you are interested in through similar equipment and see if you like the sound.

You definitely want higher output pickups for your style of playing, sounds like you are a metal player through and through. I got the ones I got because I like pickups that work with lower gain sound, and are responsive to picking dynamics (hard, soft... etc) and do not compress my sound.

I am a blues/Jazz/fusion player, so it is really impossible for me to tell you what to buy, only that DiMarzio pickups are (in my experience) true to what DiMarzio say they are.

DiMarzio list the ""treble mid and bass"" emphasis for each pickup on their site and this info is for the most part accurate. If you want bright sounding pickups that will have a more cutting sound, go for ones with high mark on the ""treble"" line, and same if you want more ""chunking"" ones, go for a pair that they say have better bass response. 

For example, the ""Crunch Lab"" pickup http://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/humbuckers/high-power/crunch-lab was designed to be thick sounding, has more bass output, less mid and less treble.

And the other hand, the ""PAF Joe"" has been voiced for a more trebly sound, http://www.dimarzio.com/pickups/humbuckers/paf-joe supposedly to suit Joe Satriani's ""solo"" playing style.

One was in my maths class. I hardly spoke, still read. 

This one girl would come and go, she did bath salts, she would come with her harrowing experience of how she thought she was going to die and how her friend had passed out on train tracks and the like. One day she told us she tried crack cocaine because everyone kept asking her to do so.  That was only the tip of the iceberg.

Brooks' insistence to continue playing Kendrick Perkins significant minutes, in traditional lineups, despite Miami going small and killing it from the outside doomed us. When Westbrook had been healthy this season, Brooks seemed to be doing a much better job of managing his rotations. On top of that, KD, Westbrook and Ibaka are all significantly better than they were in 2012. Not to mention, the combination of Jackson and Lamb coming off the bench offers a much different dynamic in terms of bench production, along with greater lineup flexibility. 

Miami is still clearly the team to beat, and they would still be the favorites in a series, but OKC could absolutely beat them. "

* Why are we comparing the number of unsolicited messages rather than the number of messages they respond to? It is well known that on dating sites, men tend to send messages at a far higher rate than women. This only shows the number of messages they received without initiating the conversation. You need to include messages they received in response to messages they sent in order to get a better picture of their ""prospects.""
* Why is there only one data point between 4'8"" and 5'0""? There should be four. What happened to the rest of that data? Or was the sample size small?
* Why is there no source? How many people were polled? How many people of each height?

Nogbadd,confession,1390192182.0,"&gt; It is my free will that will bring about future changes

Breaking habits is unbelievably hard. And there are some habits that I don't want to break. As I got older, I reflected upon how my SO would react if she found out about those parts of my life I had compartmentalised. And I realised that she would have every right to be disappointed in me. She would have said to me: ""why didn't you tell me? It's not the act, its the deceit"". So I s l o w l y opened up to her and I found that she accepted me for who I am. So I dispensed with some behaviours and shared others.

I am not saying ""Here's what I did, you must copy me!"", as that would be silly. But I am saying that perhaps the ""do nothing"" option is not sustainable, and it is only a matter of time until you have to face up what you have previously preferred to keep secret. So if there is a red circle on the calendar, why not make that at a time and at a date of your choosing?

Anyway, I wish you well in dealing with your desires. You sound to me like a strong man, dealing with the challenges of his sexuality in a mature and responsible way. I hope that you find the strength to carry on balancing what feels good for you personally, and what works for your relationship with your partner."
TheJumboShrimp,infj,1390192184.0,"Yes, INFJs do this, and a few other types. The reason is that we experience emotions socially. We have a hard time getting a grasp on what we're feeling until we talk with someone about it. When talking with someone else isn't an option, we just talk to imaginary people in our heads. This way, we can sort out our emotions as best we can. INTJs do this, too, but they argue and discuss thoughts, not feelings. Other types do it for the same reasons. I personally talk with my therapists when I'm feeling anxious, Mom when I want to rant, and I have various people if I feel bad about myself so they can tell me how much of a doo-doo head I am. It's not weird, it's totally cool! Enjoy it :3"

If people could choose their race then this would be an apt comparison. You're not interested in dating ""high number girls"" based off a series of decisions that they made in the past, that's different.

The one similarity is that having a ""high number"" doesn't necessarily speak to how you would actually get along with those girls or even who the girl currently is as a person.  It's very possible/likely that there are ""high number girls"" out there that you'd get along great with. But I don't think you're an asshole for having that preference."

The only thing that saved the Harry Potter fandom from the perv label is that it wasn't originally targeted at little girls, it became apparent pretty quickly it was an all ages enjoyable series.

zdude1858,WorldofTanks,1390192242.0,"the downvotebots were banned before anyone could report them. I understand that it was meant as a joke, but the number one rule on the sidebar is just stick to reddiquette.

 Normally I'm not a stickler for reddiquette as really its just a suggestion for how to keep the site running well, and s-mores usually handles that kind of stuff, but when the name of the bot alone suggests that its only purpose is to violate 3 of 3 rules on how to vote, I felt that it had to be banned. And I also think that if you want to hate on someone, bring your main account, don't hide behind alts.

for the auto-bots, they generally receive the first report about 5-7 hours after posting the first time. I usually don't consider banning them until then, unless its something exceptionally stupid like the now/meow bots. I just happened into this thread and this particular bot and didn't think that it contributed anything more than a solitary laugh, so I didn't remove the post, because the first time is moderately humerous but after that it's dumb.

As far as the after battle screenshots/replays, its just something else to fill up this sub between endless discussion of the same tanks and how2play for new players and the occasional mechanics changes/new tanks/leaks.

I guess its just a difference of opinion, I think that scorecards/replays are tolerated, and you think that auto bots should be tolerated.

although, if you want to make a detailed post telling people to make self-posts about their good games instead of posting screenshots/replays, then I can probably sticky it, but I'm not making any major policy changes while people are downvoting every post I make because it would make it impossible to get an accurate picture of whether people like/don't like the changes."

Fall in love with a version of her that was in my head and not the real her? Absolutely check. 


But honestly, I never even masturbated while thinking about her. The way I felt about her had nothing to do with how she looked or what I thought she'd be like in bed. It's that I was totally addicted to her personality. And while I acknowledge that I shouldn't have gotten in that deep with someone who didn't feel the same about me, and those feelings definitely ruined our friendship, it had nothing to do with sex whatsoever.

1. The Photographer should have some good ideas, but here is what I would like- A few that highlight the feature of your body that I really like (butt, legs, shoulders, etc..). A few where I can see your face. If you feel racy, something that is fappable. 

2. I don't think that a framed pic would be good, hes not going to display it. A small photo book would be best. Something he can keep by his bed and look at in private.

If you live apart, this is a great way to keep him excited. And later in life I'm sure he would treasure those pics. "

HRT is super interesting, and kind of awesome. To brag for a second, [this was 6 months](http://i.imgur.com/yarQKD0.jpg) - I'm 14 months along now, but I kinda think those two pictures in particular are cool.

I really hope people like you going into ~pharmacy stuff~ improves the doctor/prescription/etc situation. I've had some pretty lousy experiences with pharmacists, as well as some really good ones. The worst was the one who took my prescription, told me my insurance denied it (without trying to bill it to insurance, I later discovered), and that I could pay the $1100 prescription ""if I wanted.""

edit: I forgot to finish that thought. Basically, the pharmacist saw my prescription for HRT, and gave me a BS response as to why I couldn't fill it. Because I'm trans. gg."

What sort of ""expert"" is applicable in a case like this? A theologian? An art historian? A forensic chemist?

Or how about one of the guys who ran neurological tests on the visionaries while they were having an apparition? Remember them?

How about a stage hand who works at a local community theater? Because he would be able to identify glow-in-the-dark paint since he uses it in his job.

Here's an extremely interesting excerpt from one article I found (http://www.medjugorjetoday.tv/9873/statue-in-vickas-house-glows-in-the-dark/):

&gt; Laura Marcazzan Budimir is of the same opinion:

&gt; “This sign is for the parishioners, for sure! The parishioners of Bijakovici (where the house is located, ed.) especially. Because why there, in that house? And why now and not one month ago? At this time there are just a few pilgrims!” she tells Medjugorje Today.

LucasSatie,NoStupidQuestions,1390192575.0,"No, accreditation is not required and public schools must also go through accreditation. Some schools will actually accredit themselves and (if I recall correctly) has lead to some awkward scandals in the past.

There are independent organizations that offer accreditation and each organization has a higher or lower standard and thus more prestige is linked to the school for achieving that accreditation. I imagine some schools may not need the backing as their school's name will hold credit enough (Harvard/MIT/etc...) but I really don't know for sure. Edit: [Harvard is accredited, at least in part, by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.](http://www.provost.harvard.edu/institutional_research/accreditation.php)

For instance, the [NASPAA](http://www.naspaa.org/) offers accreditation for public administration while [ASCBP](http://www.acbsp.org/page/main) offers accreditation for business programs.

These organizations basically ensure that the school is teaching the appropriate classes with the appropriate material at an appropriate difficulty. "

In order to prevent that with my current BF, we have ""hermit time"". It was explicitly discussed that we both need alone time and that it is not a reflection towards our feelings about the other person. Whenever it's time to be antisocial, we simply tell the other that we need hermit time.

Moving in together complicated this, but our solution is currently that we have hermit nights where one of us gets the house to ourselves while the other has to go hang out with friends."

And you think this because...

&gt;  Lot's of straight guys are uncomfortable around gay dudes because the gay men would potentially want to have sex with them.

...right? Well, I completely disagree. Why does it matter who is attracted to me? If a gay man wants to have sex with me, how does that affect me?

&gt; Please don't trivialize the issue, it merits discussion.

Honestly, you're trying to turn this discussion into something it's not. None of the ""issues"" you bring up have any bearing on the fact that it's absurd to lump a large pool of people together and try to assign characteristics to them.

bleeker_street,Advice,1390192682.0,"Hello thesmartassity, 

I would say your age is plays a pretty important role in determining if the damage is permanent. If you continue to smoke, and even possibly now, it will become permanent.  If you were to stop smoking right away you may be able to reverse some of the damage.

Since you're only been smoking for about a year, odds are more in your favour.  You can facilitate this repair process by not smoking, or using irritating foods and drinks, resting your voice between performances (including how much you talk), lowering the temperature of hot beverages like tea of coffee (not so that they're lukewarm, but not scalding either), and even going to voice therapy. 

I would strongly encourage you to quit smoking for a whole host of reasons, but I also know that it's not that simple.  [r/stopsmoking](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking) and Allen Carr's material were invaluable for my husband when he quit. "

jaerick,MonsterHunter,1390192734.0,"I just got my Atlantis Crabstone the other day so I can offer some advice - most importantly, that you don't need your million resource points at the same time - you just need to accrue a million over time. I got the award at about 800K resources. I'm soloing on 3DS, so I couldn't do any of this item duping business.

You can indeed just buy stacks and stacks and stacks of scatterfish, but it's just really boring, I'd rather be hunting than just navigating menus for hours. In twenty minutes of running back and forth, buying and converting, you'll still only make a couple hundred thousand resources.

Toppling Uragaans for Lava Nuggets is really the best way to do it -  though I actually recommend prolonging the run as much as possible rather than killing him as quickly as possible over and over again. Use a super weak weapon with shit damage and shit sharpness. The G Rank Black Diablos set has almost perfect skills, with Stamina Thief and KO King natural on the set. Gem in Speed Gather.

Just do the very first village Uragaan quest, eat for Lucky Cat if you can. The basic idea is to get 3 KOs on the guy, and get him to run out of stamina 3 or 4 times per run. Once you get the hang of it, it's actually pretty easy to get upwards of twenty Lava Nuggets in one run - once he's fatigued just fish for the roll by standing really far away from him (but not with your back toward lava) and running toward him the second you see his chin go up, and you'll be able to get to him falling over before the button prompt even pops up to get your mines. You get 3 mines per topple, which is what Speed Gather is for - if you aren't quick it's easy to end up only gathering twice and getting one Nothing Found. Then capture him once he's limping (unless you think you can squeeze out another Fatigue cycle before he dies) and boom, more chances in the rewards. My best run netted me 32 lava nuggets total - 26 mined during the quest and 6 in the rewards.

Then you just resign to the fact that that's all you'll be doing for the next umpteen hours, and hey, it gets kind of fun to repeatedly knock the dumb bastard over."

Shit, I had no idea. 

""Asimov suffered a heart attack in 1977, and had triple bypass surgery in December 1983. When he died in New York City on April 6, 1992, his brother Stanley reported heart and kidney failure as the cause of death.[39] He was survived by his second wife, Janet, and his children from his first marriage. Ten years after his death, Janet Asimov's edition of Asimov's autobiography, It's Been a Good Life, revealed that the myocardial and renal complications were the result of an infection by HIV, which he had contracted from a blood transfusion received during his bypass operation.[40] Janet Asimov wrote in the epilogue of It's Been a Good Life that Asimov's doctors advised him against going public, warning that the anti-AIDS prejudice would likely extend to his family members. Asimov's family considered disclosing his condition just after his death, but the controversy that erupted the same year when Arthur Ashe announced his own HIV infection (also contracted from a blood transfusion during heart surgery) convinced them otherwise. Ten years later, after most of Asimov's doctors had died, Janet and Robyn Asimov agreed that the HIV story should be made public."""

tangerinelion,AdviceAnimals,1390192908.0,"You need to compare it *to* something, though.  Suppose you want to pay off $100k loan in 25 years at 8% APR.  That's 0.6666% interest per month, for 300 months, a FV of 0 and a PV of -100000.  That means a PMT of $770-ish (depending on whether interest is added up front or at the end of the month).

So, a quick look would say that $280 &lt;&lt; $770 and a ""normal"" payment schedule would probably be more expensive.  The complicating factor is what amounts to a balloon payment at the end where your last two payments essentially seem to jump from $540 to $30,000.  Obviously that's not fun to do and requires further analysis below.

However, the ""normal"" payment schedule would cost you $231k, about $60k more than the given schedule.

Now the complicating factor is that $30k balloon payment to the IRS.  Two things here: One is the IRS may be willing to help you out and accept say $10k in place of the $30k; after all, this is from a loan that the IRS didn't issue so it's sort of better to get something than nothing.  Next is that in order to pay $30k you need to be saving that alongside paying the loan back.  If you could get 12% return year-over-year (hah!) then this would require only an investment of $16/mo to end up with $30,362 at the end to pay off the taxes.  (Minor caveat here: You will need to be selling stuff in order to get that $30k and it would incur a profit of $25,662 on your $4,800 investment so you would need to pay capital gains tax on that $25k over the course of 25 years.  Roughly figuring this as an extra $1000 income per year to be taxed at a rate of 25%, that's an extra $250 per year or $21/mo you need to pay.)  So initially you would have ~$280 for the loan, $16 for investing, and $21 to pay tax on your capital gains at the end of the year.  That's $317.  Your other numbers adjust similarly to $427 and $577.  And we note that all of these values are under $770 so you still pay less with an IBR and an investment plan to pay off the taxes at the end of the IBR you incur from the forgiven loan that includes the money needed to pay the tax on the profits you incur along the way to pay the tax you owe at the end.

(At a slightly more realistic 6% gain - less than your loan rate - you would need to invest $43/mo but your anticipated capital gains taxes would be $14/mo.  Which is $20/mo more than you'd need at a 12% return.  However at 6%, the game changes because if you put that extra $57/mo towards the loan itself you put $57 towards the principal, reducing the interest incurred in every payment after that further accelerating the amount of principal paid down.  At the end of the loan you would then owe less tax.)

Edit:  Working through the example given:

Paying $280/mo for 5 years leaves the loan with a total value of $128,273.  Ouch.  Paying $390/mo for the following 5 years leaves you with a loan worth $162,261.  Ouch.  Then paying $540/mo for the next 15 years leaves you with a loan of $334,545.  Figuring 30% on that leaves you with a tax bill of $100,363.

Adding $60/mo to all of those payments changes the values to $123,835, $151,211, and $177,942 leaving a tax bill of around $53,382.  Which would be $46,981 less, and dividing that through one finds it's the same as $157/mo.  So for $60/mo you would be able to save yourself $157/mo later.  Since we already said you can get 6% in the investment market, this is the best use of the money.  

Also my calculations are traditional TVM calculations meaning the unpaid interest capitalizes.  Not sure if IBR does not allow this or not, but the above is probably close in the case that interest capitalizes once the loan enters repayment."

I wasn't, but I found I liked it. I was listening to it as music, not criticizing everything and breaking it down, just enjoying it. I think you have a good point that because of certain expectations, it is kind of cast aside, but I have grown to really like that album. If it wasn't a DT album, who knows what effect that would have. Honestly, I would probably be less willing to give it several solid listen throughs to figure out if I like it."

shattered_wavelength,relationships,1390192988.0,"I think our boyfriends are twins. In fact, I posted on here a while ago about this exact problem. 

Here is the deal. He doesn't affirm your need for verbal feedback. You can ask him to, and he might (for a little while at least). You can try to deal with it and tell yourself that you don't need that affirmation, you're a strong secure woman! (which may be true but doesn't mean you don't like to hear how sexy and attractive you are). You can break up, because he isn't meeting your needs. 

These are all valid options. And honestly... which you choose depends on how much you are each willing to give on this issue. I had 'the talk' with the boyfriend. I gave him specific examples of times that I felt I looked nice, of 'compliments' he had given me that were backsided and almost rude. I then gave him examples of what he should say, and how much I would appreciate it if he simply verbalized it when he looked at me and thought any sort of nice thought. My boyfriend now makes an effort to tell me when he thinks I look nice. He tries to verbalize what he is feeling when he feels something especially strong towards me. Is that enough for me? Sometimes. Other times I feel vaguely sad and neglected. 

But this is about you. Have you had a serious, example-laden, this is how it needs to be, sort of talk with him? He NEEDS you to sit down and make it clear, with specific phrase guidelines, how much this means to you. It's awkward, it's embarrassing, and it may not even be worthwhile in the long run. But if you want to be happier in this relationship this is what you need to do. "

Say you have to see someone really quick and then later on come back to the group energetic and friendly. Since you left them at a peak, you left with the impression of the peak, and they expect more of it when they see you later. Getting back to the people also gives you a chance to have kino. Tap them on the shoulder, play with their hair for a sec, or rub there back to initiate saying hi again. They might freak out at first if they are insecure and not really outgoing, but that's alright. Getting a reaction from a girl is what you want. Cause then they will think about you and your actions longer than if you did a boring hi. And the more girls think about you, the more they start liking.

MechMeister,MechanicAdvice,1390193013.0,"I just bought adjustable rear control arms for my Impreza on Rock Auto so that I can align it. It was about $120 for the pair, but you will also have to buy a new sway bar end link.

You may need a new wheel and maybe one, two or four new tires. Subaru says there can not be greater than 2/32 tread difference between front and rear axles, so if your tires had any less than 7/32 you will easily be spending a grand. If your wheel and tire are OK you might be able to get away under $500.

As far as DIY goes, **DON'T WORK ON THE CAR WITHOUT 2 JACK STANDS HOLDING UP THE REAR END AND AT LEAST ONE SCISSOR JACK AS A BACKUP.**

After that, a good breaker bar or power tools with a pry bar can easily replace the control arm, just make sure that the alignment shop is close by because you might be driving sideways. Sway bar end links are a bitch and a half, if you have a cut off tool you can do it, otherwise you will have to be lucky and hope the nuts spin right off."

bleeker_street,Advice,1390193369.0,"Step One: Deal with your own shit - and by that I mean your own emotions over everything that has happened in your family. 

Step Two: You and your immediate family (you, your partner and any adult children) should sit down and discuss the situation with an eye to answering any questions your kids might have about what's going on, and what boundaries you'd like to set with your broader family.  If you live at home, don't have a family of your own (yet), still do this step by yourself. 

Step Three: You now know how you want to be treated.  Tell your family.  Explain calmly, politely, and firmly that you don't like the ongoing fights in your family and you will not tolerate x. Whatever your boundaries might be, that if people start fighting you'll leave. If a family member starts bad mouthing another one on the phone with you you'll hang up.  Whatever it is.  Explain that you love them all, but the ongoing tension is having an emotional toll on you. 

Step Four:  Follow through.  This is the most important step.   If someone breaks those boundaries (and they will, if only by habit) do what you said you were going to do.  Don't apologize, but don't be angry afterwards either.  Reconnect with that family member and let them know you still love them and want to hang out but what they did wasn't acceptable. 

Step Five: Larger family talks.  Your larger family is going to need to emotionally process what happened, not just legally.  This will probably include a sit down where members of the family explain to sis-in-law the emotional consequences for her actions.  

Step Six: Talk with whomever is the spouse of sis-in-law about her current behaviour.  Don't talk about the past, things that are annoying, are her ""arrogance.""  Only talk about actual facts. Say you know that they love her, and you respect that, you don't want to cause tension in their relationship, or push them into choosing between marriage and family.  What you do want is to find a way to better negotiate how the family interacts together.  

Good luck."
P-K-Kela,Seahawks,1390193370.0,"Does anyone have a link of when both Sherman and Wilson got interviewed post-game? I believe it was after the Seahawks accepted the NFC Championship trophy - but not totally sure.

The only reason I believe Sherman came off that way because of the adreneline rush post-game was the fact that when the other newscasters told him he accidentally scared off the reporter, he looked pretty apologetic/sheepish. Naturally after cooling down, he realized his mistake, so I feel like it's easily forgiven. Understandably, he wouldn't have done that in a normal situation.

A child who has murdered someone is going to be different from another who doesn't.  Eren murdered those guys for Mikasa it shows such character and even strong sense of leadership.

Yet...  he cries at any second he gets.  To me the character feels like he's constantly about to break down in almost every chapter.  His emotions are justified for anger but crying?  I can understand someone breaking down because they cannot cope when something happens...  I just honestly wish he had Armin's brain...  Armin is really mature even though he cried earlier in the season I think he's incredibly mature in how he thinks. 

He rationalizes and makes the right call.  He understands in that world certain things are not the same as for instance here, that's the thing I think you're missing.  This world they are in, what they have gone through It IS suppose to change them.  No normal person could go unchanged during something like that, yet Eren cries or you can see in the panels him looking like he's being overwhelm by something on his mind.  I just cannot for the life of me understand that.  I reason it out for myself and know if I went through all of that I wouldn't be like that I couldn't even if I wanted to.  My reaction to something will be different than someone who hasn't gone through it.

People deal with grieving differently.  We all know and respect this, Eren was 5 when his mother died correct?  So 10 years ago he dealt with that, he saw Thomas die, he heard about Marco ( I think) death.  Then he blamed himself for his first squads death.  Now he's worrying about Armin in the recent chapters, I understand people deal with situations in their own way but to me the character just sounds like for instance us going through it.  Where is the immersion in that?  The amazing character development?  Eren has been the same character since the time we saw him age to 15.  Nothing has changed and he is the lead role...  So how is it that going through all this can bring no change to him?

He acts like how we for instance would act.  As if it's his first time going through trauma...  I am seriously just lost at how this character can be..  For instance look at Erwin!  The guy was riding his horse got freaking bit by a Titan and instead of asking for help his #1 priority was to save Eren before his own damn life.  Obviously his determination to save humans is great and it's the sole reason for his actions.  Regardless that is character development.  That is something anyone would love to see!  It shows how great the character is, the obvious attempt at refuting this will be he's an adult he's been through a lot.  So has EREN!  A child who's parents always come home late is forced to grow up quicker than her peers.  She has to cook/clean/look after her siblings etc.  Just like this the things that have happened should cause change.  Look how mature Armin is?  I dare say Armin has one of the same line of thinking as Erwin when it comes to saving humanity.

Levi's dealing with death is amazing to me.  It shows what it takes to be a leader.  Eren is in the position of great power and literally humanity hopes rest entirely on his shoulders.  Tough thing to shoulder?  Why yes it is.  Yet he acts so far from it, people from Royalty do not have control over some parts of their life.  Imho you are not suppose to marry anyone you up and meet it's irresponsible and could lead to the downfall of your kingdom you are royalty so you must act it and carry yourself as such.  Just in the same way Eren is someone who could lead humanity forward yet he breaks down or suffers greatly from just about anything that sways his emotions.  It's his character I agree, I just think it's poor character.  It shows the lack of adapting, the lack of maturity, lack of all around leadership which he needs to have.  For now Levi and Erwin are alive but what happens if they die in the future ( which they might)?"

My first kiss with my now boyfriend is a bit of a long one. I went on a cruise in 2012 and met him at those ""teen clubs"" they have set up. When I saw him for the first time I remember thinking ""Okay this guy is super hot. I need to let him know that I'm interested and see if he'll try anything."" So that entire week was full of me flirting with him. Not just shy flirting but full on NOTICE ME flirting. Alas, the last night of the cruise came and he had not been able to decipher any of my hints. We were walking along the running track they had on the very top floor of the cruise and I decided to make a move. I told him ""I really like you and I've been trying to get you to notice me all week."" I thought to myself ""You're probably never going to see this guy again so just go for it!"" That's when I kissed him. We both were so surprised at what I did that we kind of lost our balance and ended up having a really messy kiss. After that mess of a kiss I was ready to go back to my cabin and pack up since we were supposed to leave early the next morning. To my surprise her pulled me in again for another kiss! He told me that he had thought that I was just being super nice the whole week (men amiright?) By the end of that night I had had one of the most amazing make out sessions of my life. The next morning we met up again and had some more fun. We kept communicating with each other for a couple of months after but I didn't want to start anything long distance (He's in Michigan, I'm in Florida). After a couple of months of not talking, I randomly get a text from him and we start talking again. I realized just how much I like this guy. So we made it official almost a year after cruise! We've been together for 7 months now and I've never been happier. The distance sucks but it's worth it :)"

At any rate, if you've played extensively, and it sounds like you have, there's nothing wrong with going out for a club team. If you don't make it, don't give up. Keep playing and try out again when you have another chance. Play on the practice squad if that's an option.

If you do make the team, as far as the environment goes, it can be great, or it can be mediocre. It all depends on how you approach the team. No matter what, you'll probably take some ribbing for your age (or lack thereof), and you'll have to cut your teeth on a new team. You may have been pretty hot shit on your high school team, but on a club team, it's a new ballgame. The most important thing is to stay humble. You're probably no longer the superstar like you were on a your school team. There are probably people there who have been playing as long as you've been alive.

Granted, some background in coding does help, e.g. someone with a web development background would be more able to spot potential for SQL or Javascript injection attacks, but a hacker's efforts are split between network security, social engineering and some coding, whereas a programmer is developing one craft full time. Professional hackers tend not to write a lot of code anyway, because most of the tools they need have already been written, and re-inventing the wheel isn't cost effective."

CalvinDehaze,funny,1390193855.0,"&gt;In late May 1986, around three weeks after her 18th birthday, authorities discovered she had been underage while making all but one of her pornographic movies and arrested her, as well as the owners of her movie agency and X-Citement Video, Inc. (See United States v. X-Citement Video.) The ensuing prosecution against the agencies cost the pornographic film and distribution industry millions of dollars, as they were obliged by law to remove hundreds of thousands of her videotapes, films and magazines from store shelves to avoid the risk of prosecution for trafficking in child pornography. (The legality varies with countries. For example, while it is illegal in France to produce a pornographic film involving an actor under 18, the film remains legal.[8])
&gt;In her autobiography, Traci Lords: Underneath It All (2003), Lords suggested hypocrisy on the part of the movie producers and the news media, arguing the porn industry actually got richer from the publicity of the scandal, even as they complained of losing money after destroying her illegal movies. Lords felt she was also exploited by the reporters, who used censored stills from her unlawful films. Lords herself was never charged with a crime. Instead, the agents and producers who accepted her false IDs were charged, and people affiliated with the films in question experienced legal troubles for years.
  
This had a ripple effect throughout the porn industry, and it made everyone really nervous. Since then, porn has self-regulated everything to keep the government from coming after them. STD checks, age verification, custodian of records, and obscene content."

One is that there are pop science answers about 'male pattern baldness' (aka androgenic alopecia) that are widespread. you will hear to ""check your mother's relatives"", but that is a really watered down explanation. i'm gonna link to wikipedia because the article is good: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgenic_alopecia   look under the genetics tab. as far as I understand, if MPB is X-linked and recessive, it would follow that trans men who generally are XX would need the defect on both chromosomes. now, considering you've said you have baldness on both sides, you might have that defect on both X chromosomes, assuming you are XX. 

but I also think balding particularly in trans men has a lot of factors involved, and honestly...just like most cis men eventually bald (article says 70%), most trans men also have balding when taking testosterone. 

Many of the trans men I know who have been on testosterone for some time are losing their hair--but some aren't. I'm not. My hair even seems thicker in texture since going on T, though I did get masculinization of the hairline, which is when your hairline goes from a an upside down U shape to more of a square shape at the temples. I have a few residual hairs that grow at the edge of my former hairline, and it definitely is about an inch further back.

There are a few products and prescriptions to fight balding, and they should work just as well in trans men as cis men. 

another link that may help is: http://www.ftmguide.org/hairloss.html  though, an awesome resource, it's quite text heavy.

Do you think balding looks bad?  I actually find balding kind of attractive at times--it's definitely 'male' looking.  I feel a little weird linking to this, but have you ever seen http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/TSsuccesses/TransMen.html ?
most of the guys there have some degree of balding going on, but I think a lot of them wear it well.

But I can't imagine getting the heroes now and trying to adapt them for the next era.  I can't imagine them getting any more modern than now.

We reached #25 last year, it took about 2 years, so yeah, I'm guessing 6 more years till a #100?. (Just doing the maths).

For now, I'm more interested in how DC will bring back cancelled books/characters.  If they do, will they do Marvel style relaunch and start with #1? (Blue Beetle [maybe it'd a duo book], Demon Knights or solo Etrigan).

pstanish,FeMRADebates,1390194001.0,"&gt;But anyways, I'll kick off the Pt2 on Srolism now.

I am assuming that line means that you want us to respond about Srolism now.

&gt; In a Srolian culture (or Srolia for short), gender roles are culturally enforced. Boys and girls are raised differently. Men and women are perceived to have different innate strengths and weaknesses. Gender roles may be enforced by overt laws mandating different roles, or may be a subtle social pressure. Certain professions may be considered ""men's work"" while others are considered ""women's work."" An individual who believes that men and women should be raised differently is Srolist.

I will go out on a limb and say that men and women both have different strengths and weaknesses. Men's most obvious strength is strength, women's most obvious strength is ... well I don't really know, I just sort of assumed they were well rounded, but they probably have at least one strength head and shoulders above the others. I don't think that this is controversial, I also think that we should accommodate the differences in raising children so that we can maximize the number that succeeds.

I think we can all get behind the abolition of laws that specifically enforce gender roles. Unless you have specific examples of laws that do though, I am not going to discuss this point any more.

Subtle social pressure is definitely the tougher side to deal with. I don't really know how to combat this.

Given my belief that both genders have different strengths, I do believe that there are certain jobs that come easier to men (lets say NHL player) and others that exclusively women can do (LPGA player). I would advocate for never telling a person that they cannot do something unless it is impossible, but when a child (because I assume when talking about people being taught it is referring to children) expresses concern that they seemingly have to work harder for the same results that some things come easier to different people and that they may be facing an uphill battle.

I do think men and women should be raised differently to extent. We only share ~98% of our DNA between sexes, so it seems pretty obvious to me that they will both thrive in different environments. I am not suggesting grooming one for success and one for housekeeping. I am saying that both sexes should be groomed for success in the most appropriate way possible for them, I would assume that this will come across as unfortunate from the feminist perspective, but there may be differences in the way that occurs for both sexes."

When I start off with no story, my process generally focuses on uncovering the tale that I want to tell. I will develop the backstory as I work through the piece, rather than beforehand.

They love their spouses, they care for their children, they would run into a burning house to save a stranger. But they simply don't see cats and dogs the way that you and I do. They see them as fluffier, cuter, less annoying bugs. Sure, you put up with them and you pet them and sometimes Fido and Cupsy do cute things that make you smile. But if they are in the way or too annoying, you bat them aside and squish them. Not in a deliberately cruel or painful manner, but matter-of-factly. Like killing that spider in your bathroom that you let live there for a while, but the in-laws are visiting and now it's time to clean.

It's a way of viewing the world, and for some people... it's how they specifically view cats. Does he like dogs? Or is he ambivalent about all animals?

Either way, you will have to decide if this act was him being a complete and utter asshole, or him simply not valuing animal life the same way you do. And then decide if you can live with either of those attitudes the rest of your life. Honestly, this would be a deal breaker for me. Not because I would necessarily assume this meant he was a bad person, but because this was MY pet, and I was clearly emotionally involved with it. Whatever his views on animals and pets, he should have consulted you if for no other reasons that those. "

We pay ~$300 to spend a week [there](http://www.sagnlandet.dk/English.425.0.html), and a guide comes by every morning and noon, and tells us what's up.

The guides are the professionals - they've got a university education in the field, they've got training, and they're the ones who plan the weekly schedule.

For example: Last year they were curious about how long it would take a team to build a simple re-useable smelting oven. She told us about different finds that had been done, and what was similar about them, and together we planned how we wanted to do it.

six of us then started working: Digging clay, breaking burnt rock, gathering thatch, mixing it up, shaping it into bricks, digging the foundation, and building the oven. (~800 pounds of clay)

We then gave feedback - what worked, what did we do differently, what struck us as odd, suchlike - and tried whether the oven worked or not."

we need to get married. think about it tho… I'm hot. your semi-hot. imagine how hot our babies would look

(when she pushes back)

yeah but nothing a couple plastic surgeries can't fix. by a couple i mean no more than 15 (whatever bullshit she says) anyways we need to start working on mission: baby

can you remember the (shirt/hat/whatever) i was wearing the other day? can you guess what material it was? father material

//one liners// If I was to ask you three things about yourself that would make me want to get to know you better, and none of them can be about your looks or what you do, what would they be?

I couldn’t help noticing that you’re mind-blowingly hot.

I suggest we drink before we go out drinking.

Hey, wanted to touch base in case you get rich. (loooOoove this one. for some reason you'll almost always get a response)

Let’s party like rock stars that only play video games !

If you showed up on a free porn site I would definitely click through.

Thought you should know I totally blasted my pecs today.

My plan is to travel the world in a Panda suit.

I’m glad we stay mildly interested in each other’s lives.

I’ve been telling my mom about you, and she said I should call.

We’re total fucking bad asses.

Let’s have a frank discussion about our favorite sexual positions.

I’ve put more thought into my [Halloween] costume than into my career.

This is the one holiday where our full-blown alcoholism could possibly go undetected.

you seem generally well liked, but inside you have a part of yourself that you hide from other people, that you don't show anyone except for people you really trust.

I can’t believe how much I’m not sick of you.

(If they can’t do something) Your busy day is interfering with my slacking off.

(In response to what I’m doing) I’m practicing the shocker. (Go with the flow after this).

I’m concerned your hotness may eventually make me insecure.

Someday I want to adopt an Asian baby with you.

Big dinners make me drowsy, so let’s do the sex part first.

I’d appreciate it if you started treating me like a sex object.

Let’s go to a crowded party or bar to socialize exclusively with ourselves.

Please make yourself available to talk when I have nothing to do while driving.

I’d take you to coffee but your Starbucks drink order embarrasses me.

Let’s invite ugly friends out tonight to highlight our hotness.

I’m too horny to be in public.

Let’s pretend to get together soon !

I really can’t say enough good things about your blowjobs.

Fucking you really turns me on.

Sometimes I get sad about how uncool you’ve become.

Someday we should go into rehab together.

I’m ready to change my Facebook relationship status if you are.

I caught you staring at my package.

I love it when you tell a story 368 times.

I insist that everyone start calling me by my porn name.

If I ever run for president, my association with you is going to haunt me.

Just an FYI that my Facebook friend tally has recently skyrocketed.

Just wanted you to know that I’m new to the neighborhood and am required by law to tell you that.

Really great meeting you, but I’m currently not in the market for new friends.

I’d like your permission to slightly exaggerate our friendship.

Just saying hi and wondering if the morning-after pill worked.

Let me know when you’re available so I can make sure I’m busy.

Welcome back if you were on vacation.

When you’re with me, your beverages are roofie-free.

Your username is making me hesitant to flirt with you.

I want you to uproot your life and move to my hometown so we can casually date.

I’ve almost figured out our relationship.

I’m glad you recognize how terrible your life is without me.

I bet my weekend can kick your weekend’s ass.

I’d bang you if you weren’t such a nice girl …

Ha-ha, I’ve got you by the balls now !

I hope you’re smiling.

What sort of trouble are you causing ?

Guess what ! (If lame response) Bad girl. I said guess. Try again.

Thinking of you (and taking cold showers).

You’re boring. Better start being entertaining before I leave you..

I just don’t think we should do this anymore … sometimes you make me feel like I am just a piece of meat.

Let’s fly to Las Vegas, get married, argue about our third kid’s name, develop a gambling problem, divorce, and grow old lonely and depressed

Hey ! I really miss you and want to see you badly but this dumbass security guard won’t let me into the zoo. Can you escape ?

Today is Holy Shit You’re Hot Day, send this to someone you know who is hot … just not to me, I’ve been getting this fucking text all day ;p

Exciting, you are going to make a great soccer mom some day ! I will keep an eye out for used mini vans and do some research on anti-depressants for you !

Hey, I was just thinking about you, wish you were here (so you could cook me something and do my dishes / so you could fetch me a drink and give me a foot massage / so you could clean my house and do my laundry).

So bottom line, you kinda impressed me tonight … and I don’t get impressed very often. Keep up the good work ;)

Yeah it’s big … sorry, wrong [girl's name].

I forgot, are we fighting ? And most importantly, am I winning ?

Stop thinking about me !

I think of you every time I browse my phone on the toilet.

You’re only as old as you feel while getting wildly fucked.

It’s been too long since we threw up on each other.

Let’s confirm that we’re getting pants-shitting drunk tonight.

If I was your co-worker I’d sexually harass you.

If we were in prison together I’d totally help you not get raped.

Don’t forget that blowjobs are like flowers for men.

You’re going to be a great MILF

Let’s do the whitest thing imaginable.

Surprise !

Knock knock …

How’s my favorite little brat doing ?

Ciao bella ! / Mi amore ! / Ma cherie amour !

I just made you open your phone for no reason … looks like I got you in check =]

What sort of trouble are you causing ?

I am luring women to my house with candy … do you prefer Skittles or M&amp;Ms ? (My Addition: Bring preferred candy to next meeting. Funny. Also, after reading posts they always pick Skittles … I’m going to actually try and bring a fun pack of Skittles when I’m out and use this as a funny opener. If they say Skittles, I’ll take out the pack, pop one in my mouth and say, “Want a Skittle ?”)

Girls are gross …

I hope you are smiling. If not, just think of me !

Aliens are coming to abduct all the sexy people off the planet and force them to breed.

You should be safe, I just wanted to text to say goodbye.

Out of all the (first name) (last name)s I know … I think you’re my favorite.

You just popped into my head, so hi … now please stay out of there

I don’t know who your boyfriend is … but he’s not spanking you enough !

I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly.

Awww, you’re so sweet. You’re making me get diabetes.

I was thinking of you …

Something about you seems to always make me smile.

Feel better so I can guiltlessly / mercilessly make fun of you again.

I’m glad you recognize how bad your life would be without me.

(On the stress of relationships) Life would be easier if we were gay.

If you really loved me you would say it on my Facebook Wall. (After waiting a while when they message) I just finished balancing my chi, what are you up to ?

I get it … you’re just a simple woman who wants her salad tossed.

I couldn’t get through [day of the week]s without knowing you’re equally miserable.

Swimming. My pool. And by pool I mean bathtub. And by swimming I mean sex.

I just want to put these predictions in writing for the future.

If the commission decides constat de non supernaturalitate, I predict the pro-Medjugorje community will counter:

* (a) that the decision merely means there was, at the time of the decision, insufficient evidence of supernatural character and that a reversal of the judgment is to be hoped for in the future;
* (b) that the commission failed to consider all of the available evidence;
* (c) that the commission’s decision is void on the grounds of some irregularity;
* (d) that the decision does not prohibit private pilgrimages to Medjugorje, privately organized Medjugorje-related events such as planned apparitions in non-church-owned venues, nor the private production and distribution of literature of a merely informative nature about the phenomenon;
* (e) that the commission is not infallible in its pronouncements;
* (f) that the pro-Medjugorje community will assert that the supernatural character of the Medjugorje phenomenon lies not the discredited apparitions but in the spiritual experiences of the devotees."

pstanish,FeMRADebates,1390194738.0,"Abortion leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I am begrudgingly for it.

&gt;Should it be a freely available thing? A wait time?

I heard that the wait times in my home city were so long some people were unable to obtain abortions there. That being said, if there is a wait time, I think it might work best if the wait time was under 9 months. Ideally it would not conflict with the maximum time allowed into a pregnancy.

&gt;If for, how long into pregnancy should it be allowed?

I haven't really thought about this all that much. IIRC, in the States, abortions are legal before 24 weeks. In my opinion that should give a woman enough time to decide and go for the procedure (what is that, ~20 weeks you will know you were pregnant?). Since I have not thought about this that much, I will only say that this seems like enough time to get the procedure done, but I would really prefer for abortions to be performed earlier rather than later.

I am from Ontario, so we give ~~one~~ free abortions ~~per year per women~~. I like the idea of abortions being accessible, but I don't like the fact that the government gives away free procedures to people who were irresponsible enough to inadvertently get pregnant (I know women can get pregnant by rape and in that case the bill should be sent to the rapist) so in an ideal world, I would like to find a way for the woman and her partner (as they decide) to pay back the government without making abortions less accessible. I have no idea how this should be done.

But, I will say that even in Rose's MVP season, Westbrook put up extremely similar numbers, and he's only gotten better since then. Westbrook was arguably the best PG in the league this season prior to his surgery, whereas Rose was HORRIBLE. Taj Gibson is not a better rim protector than Serge, that is laughable. Serge is also a better rebounder, a better shooter, and a better scorer overall. On top of that, he is four years younger. Clearly Noah is better than Perkins, but the Thunder's best lineups don't even include Perkins, they include Serge at the 5. Jeremy Lamb and Reggie Jackson are better than any player coming off the Chicago bench outside of Taj."

ponysniper2,seduction,1390194742.0,"To be honest, when you put yourself in situations were there are gorgeous women, and your horny and women throw themselves at you. Cheating just becomes normal. I thought I'd never do it, I did think about doing it a lot, but I never thought I'd actually do it. Then it just happened. I think it's just natural to want other people. However there's a difference between fucking and actually liking and loving someone for who the are. The first guy you described in this post fucks many women but says he loves his girl, this can be true. Sex is just sex, nothing much else. I mean yes it hurts your partner if they found out, and if you truly love them, then you'll feel extremely sad for cheating on them. You might continue to do it, still doesn't mean you don't love them, just means your not in the mentality to stay loyal at the moment or they just haven't shown you they are worth staying loyal for. Sometimes people just can't stay loyal because of insecurities or for pure lack of empathy/sympathy. It all really depends on what value and connotation YOU apply to cheating."

To me, what this demonstrates is how bullpoop gender roles can hurt men too.  I think when men are sentenced some consideration should be given into the circumstances around their crimes.

keakealani,singing,1390195212.0,"I think you're talking about the [vocal fry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_fry_register). It's very hard to describe, and I imagine both the physical and aural sensations are slightly different for male voices than for female voices so I'm not sure I can help you much anyway, but hopefully that can give you something to look at and apply to your own sensation. 

On a broader level, it sounds like what you're generally talking about is a concept called *registration*. Basically, there are various ways of understanding the voice in terms of ""registers"" - terms like chest, head, and falsetto are often used in relation to various registers. 

Unfortunately, one of the big issues with registration is that there is controversy even amongst professional vocal pedagogues and scholars as to what exactly is happening within the voice that can be called a register, or a shift in registers. Often, we can hear one thing aurally, but physically, something else is happening. One prevailing mode of thought, for example, identifies one unified modal register, which encompasses what many people call head and chest voice, with auxiliary registers like the fry register and falsetto register in men, and the fry register and whistle register in women. (Additionally, there's still controversy about whether or not a female falsetto even exists; I personally don't believe I've ever experienced it, but I think it may be possible for especially lower voice types.) 

Within that modal voice, however, one can experience physical or aural sensations that result in an abrupt change of timbre or vocal quality - these have previously been called ""registration shifts"" but may actually be more indicative of simply poorly transitioning from one pitch to the next while preserving the same basic ""register"" in the sense that the vocal folds vibrate in basically the same position. 

Anyway, all of this is to say that, some vocal pedagogues may not even agree that a distinct ""chest voice"" and ""mixed voice"" even exist at all, and many experts have different ways of describing the same phenomena. It's entirely possible that you may have had the concepts explained in a way that doesn't adequately account for your specific voice and sensations. After all, each voice is unique and can only be felt first-hand by the singer, so there's almost no way to describe any aspect of the voice in a fully definitive manner. 

Of course, you may have obvious registration shifts and just can't hear it or feel it - unfortunately, I'm not sure there's a good solution for that other than having someone hear you and tell you that you're shifting registers (or sub-registral areas, if you subscribe to the unified modal register theory), and then retroactively understanding the physical or aural sensation that is associated. 

But, I think it's equally as likely that you do not have the ""expected"" registration shifts - this could be a result of many different factors and without specific analysis by a professional instructor, there's not really any way to diagnose specific issues (if any exist) inherent with your registration.

Consider the second sentence of the following story:

""Our family get along very well with the Wilsons. We and they even went on a vacation together last summer.""

Most native speakers will tell you that the second sentence is not anything anyone would actually say; far more natural would be ""Us and them even went on a vacation together last summer.""

The topic the other day about the kind of household we were raised in really got me thinking, and wondering about if growing up with a narcissistic father pushed me towards being an INFJ, or if it uniquely preyed on my predispositions. Neither of my siblings is an INFJ. (My sister is an ESFP - my brother shows inconsistent typing, but I'm only really starting to grasp the functions in a way that would allow me to help him type himself with the functions.) There isn't too much overlap in the cognitive functions between myself and my sister, though. I pretty much ignore my Se all of the time, and I think her Ni (her 4th function) is also largely ignored."

Dinaroozie,FeMRADebates,1390195387.0,"I'm for it.

I'm torn about how long it should be allowed. Viability outside the womb seems like a sensible place to draw the line, and is morally consistent with the ""Should we be able to force someone to give up their kidney to save someone else?"" question (that is, your right to bodily autonomy overrides someone else's right to life). In other words, a pregnant woman has the right to stop supporting the life that's growing inside her, by having it removed, but she doesn't have the right to end that life - that's just a side effect.

However, if in some hypothetical future, technology pushed the point of viability earlier - perhaps so early that survival outside the womb became possible pretty much as early as the pregnancy was realised - then I suspect applying this logic would have some dire social consequences. Either financial abortion is a thing, in which case a vast quantity of unwanted pregnancies become wards of the state at massive expense, or it's not, in which case everyone who ever gets accidentally pregnant is obliged to look after that child financially for twenty years. I'm not sure what exactly the right response to that possibility would be - that's probably beyond the scope of this thread.

As for the other questions, I'd say it should be freely available. Certainly if there's a cost to be borne for the abortion, it shouldn't fall just to the woman. I'd prefer it if it was provided as a free medical procedure, though. As for wait times, for me that's an empirical question. Start without them, but if for some reason it can be shown that that results in vast quantities of people regretting their abortions, maybe they're a necessary evil."

I was in San Fran and taking the BART into town when one of the scam artists came on. It was actually impressive to see them work.

They actually ""let"" him win $5, and then he wouldn't play anymore so they gave up on him. 

The game was one of the balls in the cup but the way they do it is that they only let the players bet $20 or more and then they have 3 or more accomplices standing around shouting about which cup to choose.

The guy actually did sucker an older lady out of $20 before they *literally* all booked it off the train at the next stop (that's when I realized how many people were in on it). 

Luckily the lady was a champ and she just chuckled when she realized she'd been had. She simply said ""it's part of the San Francisco experience."" I was so amazed at her upbeat attitude... and at their scam.

First the Olympics. They use the metric system and their heaviest individual plate is 20 Kilograms which is roughly 45 pounds. Doing the weights like /u/Red_AtNight talks about gets us close to Olympic lifting without that pesky metric system that Americans love to hate.

Secondly, It is one of those things that even if it made sense to change it wouldn't. I mean, it's become such a standard in weightlifting here in the states that changing it would require *every* gym in the states to re-buy all of it's weights so no one would go for it."

I wish that I had spaced out my purchases of furniture more.  I would have better managed my money, and appreciated them more after having to wait. 

Clean the whole place before you move in. It will make moving day easier, and it's easier do to the complete clean the place will need with no stuff in your way. 

A noise pet-peeve is going to be difficult to accommodate if you're planning on living in an apartment/town home type situation.  You'll want to look for concrete walls, apartments that are situated in such a way in the building that there is a space between your and your neighbours (like beside a storage unit for example), buildings that have doors in the hallways, and of course, the type of people that are living in the building: if they are all working adults they'll probably be more understanding if you have to ask someone to turn the music down than say the five sorority sisters I live beside. Ultimately though, if you live in a place with shared walls or hallways noise is a part of life.  Expect it. 

When looking for a place don't worry so much about the paint or more cosmetic things, a building manager will take care of that.  Look for long term damage that hasn't been repaired in a while, that can give you some insight into how well things will or won't get repaired when you need maintenance to come in. 

Hope that's helpful.  Best of luck. "

Omega037,Genealogy,1390195860.0,"You have the joint problem of him having an extremely common name (Smith) and him being under 18 in 1840 (where the census just lists the head of the family).

There is a John B. and Elizabeth Smith about 7 pages later in the 1850 census that could be his parents, but there is no way to know for sure.  

Some supporting evidence though is:

1. They have a daughter named Eliza and a son named Richard (though they have several other children whose names Hilary didn't use)
2. According to [findagrave](http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=102865908), John and Elizabeth were married in 1822 but the 1850 census only shows children 18 and under (from 1832 onward).  Interestingly, they seem to have children every 2 years like clockwork from 1832 to 1844, which implies that they likely had a few children between 1822 and 1832 that we don't know about.

3. There is an entry for John B. Smith in 1840 census for Marion, KY that lists two males between 15 and 19, and one male between 10 and 14.  These are not accounted for on the 1850 census, assuming this is the same person.

This all said, there is no direct evidence of anything here.  I have tried tracking down obituaries of some of these potential siblings, but all I have managed is Richard's death certificate."

It's coiled secondary structure (thinking twisting chains, with one side facing inwards) puts water-hating ends inwards to the structure, away from water, and water loving ends outwards. Because the 'hydrophobic ends' are away from water, it wants to stay like that, and subsequently it takes a large amount of energy to break the coils apart. Hence, decomposition is extremely difficult for a lot of organisms, and takes a lot longer than normal tissue!

This is part of my self-threat that if I don't lose 3 pounds by February 1, I have to start counting calories with MyFitnessPal.

Stuff to get done this week:

- YMCA. Daughter is in desperate need of social time. Leave by 11 = start leaving by 10:30 = shower by 10 = up by 9:45 at the latest.
- find MLP figures of the six main characters to go with the ones that Nana got her for Christmas. 
- Costco: canned air if they have it, a bench for the entry if they have one that works, muffins, bread, chicken, ground beef, broccoli and other veggies, bacon, milk, berries, salad and stuff to add to salad. also check Wunderlist.
- Call counselor to reschedule appointment from last Monday.
- Clean. Doesn't matter what. Could start with:
    - ~~daughter's clothes: remove all 2T~~
    - box by the glider that has Christmas crap in it
    - coffee table toys
    - daughter's room
    - ~~leftovers in the fridge~~ I *think* this is done, for now anyway
    - find a better place for the play kitchen
    - stuff on/around fireplace
    - balcony
    - scrub toilets; attack black spots on tub with Comet
    - rearrange monitors on desk
- Eat salad. Can add: olives, fried onions, dried fruit, parmesan cheese, berries

Monday:

- ~~YMCA~~
- ~~Doctor at 1 pm.~~
- ~~Make dinner (leftover chili, needs rice)~~
- ~~Toys R Us after husband gets home~~
- I'm cutting myself slack after being up every hour last night with a sick baby.

Tuesday:

- YMCA (make it 10:30; leave by 10:00; up by 9 and shower right away)
- Tumbling class at 3:30 pm
- Laundry. Remember son's blanket!
- Make dinner (maybe hash browns, eggs, bacon)
- Watch Sleeping Beauty with daughter, if I can find it, for the birthday party this weekend (that's the theme)
- ~~Costco after husband gets home.~~
- [Edit: Tuesday is fail day. See Wednesday.]

Wednesday:

- YMCA
- ~~LAUNDRY.~~ I'm on my last pair of underwear, and I had to dig in the drawer for it. Also, son got poop on his blanket, and that's the only one we have that's big enough to swaddle him in.
- ~~Freeze muffins from Costco~~
- Clean: daughter's clothes. 
- Make dinner. Use potatoes, they're growing. Use ground beef. Beef &amp; potato &amp; bean burritos?

Thursday:

- 8:30 am doc visit for me and husband. we're sick and it might be pneumonia. So much for today...
- ~~YMCA~~ not while contagious
- ~~1:30 6-week-postpartum OB appointment~~ need to reschedule...added to Wunderlist.
- ~~Go to credit union and deposit check.~~ nope, I'm exhausted.
- ~~**Post office. Mail stuff.** FIL has been waiting on his sunglasses and BIL has been waiting on his hard drive.~~ nope, sick.
- ~~3:30 Tumbling class~~ not happening, contagious
- ~~Clean~~ I actually did put most of the laundry away, and got the 2T clothes out of daughter's dresser.
- ~~Knit night! Be ready to leave by 5:45 in case Husband is home that early.~~ nope, contagious, and too many of my friends are ill and/or have suppressed immune systems.

Friday:

- ~~Call hospital to get the number, then call the person to pay the copay from son's hospital visit. Do this today no matter what, because the 20% off deal expires sometime soon and you don't remember the date.~~ Done
- ~~Take daughter outside to ride her bike~~
- deposit check; post office
- Clean: vacuum, ~~then daughter's room.~~ Clean that corner until I find her ring that fell and got lost [edit: found the ring!]. A place for everything and everything in its place...even if that place is a pile or a cardboard box. That way, organizing her room will be a smaller job and cleaning the coffee table (which is currently covered with her toys and crap) will be easier because I'll have a place to move everything to instead of dumping it in her room and then having that be a big job.
- ~~Make dinner~~ - use ground beef, freeze the rest. Use potatoes, broccoli. Ooo, steamed broccoli with cheese on top...

[friday edit: It is 1:15. I will feed the baby in a few minutes after he's woken up enough, then we'll go outside and she'll ride her bike. Then post office and credit union. Then come home and vacuum (if only to get the shredded cheese out of the living room carpet), then clean her room; coffee table too if there's time before dinner. This is The Plan and I shall not deviate from it.]

[Later Friday edit: I deviated from The Plan. BUT I did so by skipping the errands and going straight to cleaning daughter's room, so it's not so bad. Especially since I also cleaned up the hallway closet and scrubbed the toilet which has been making me crazy, and I probably wouldn't have gotten her room done if I had gone out. Now to add ""reorganize hallway closet"" to my to-do-sometime list.]"

Somethings I'd like to see more data/discussion on:

* Longitudinal studies on the effects of medical intervention or social transition. 

* Discussions about trans related health care, supported by actual studies and not supersition. (i.e., Progesterone or no? IM vs Sublingual vs Dermal estrogen) In fact, I think it would be awesome to have a point-by-point comparison of the various different strands of SRS. 

* Moving away from figures and studies, I think it would be super neat to discuss dealing with relationships when your trans. Keeping with the focus on peeps past the 101 phase (who, presumably, have/are getting their personal shit together), discussions about what it means to be trans in society, in interpersonal relationships and at work would be useful resources for personal reflection and action.

Sure, if someone is going around telling everyone they meet about it, that's inappropriate. But this is not nor has it ever been some unheard of taboo. It's normal.

It's not a breach of privacy because it's *your life* too. It's a breach of privacy to tell their secrets, but you're talking about your own love life. It's like talking about anything else in life. It's also not like anyone is under some delusion that sex doesn't happen in relationships. It's an everyday occurrence. If there's an issue and you need advice, you need advice.

keakealani,musictheory,1390196222.0,"Actually, the heart of both composition and theory is in the same thing: analysis. Music theory is the language of analysis, and composition in the practicum. 

An initial thought might be examining your initial goal in writing music, and expressing that in distinct terms - this itself is music theory. For example, you can say ""I'd like to write a piece that takes advantage of mediant relations and modal borrowing in order to create a surreal, melancholy sound."" This is music theory - using words to describe music (even if it's just music in your head.) It doesn't have to be that example, obviously, but you can use theory to form the vocabulary used to describe the type of music you want to write. 

From there, it's all about application. Find music that has elements you'd like to include in your own piece, even if there are other ways it's completely different. You may want to use the form of a classical rondo, and choose a Beethoven piece to illustrate that form. But, you may want to use a heavy rock instrumentation, and pick a song by AC/DC that illustrates the instruments you want to use. But then, you may want to use the harmonic language of Persian dance music, and choose a piece that exemplifies that. Then, you can listen to all these pieces, analyzing the ways they achieve the things you like and want to emulate, while simultaneously creating something totally new. (By the way, a Persian dance rock band rondo sounds amazing, but that's beside the point.) 

Of course, things like scales and modes can absolutely be important, too - one of the major building blocks to composing music is defining the pitch material and harmonic language you want to use. Scales and modes can help with that, as they have predetermined pitches and harmonies that are idiomatic. You can, of course, branch out from the standard diatonic modes and either create your own synthetic scale or use some of the scales identified by composers in the past. Or, of course, you can always use a non-scalar method for defining pitch material, like a pitch set mutation or tone row. 

Anyway, those are just a few suggestions to get started - of course, music theory is fairly endless so there are equally endless numbers of possibilities for applying music theory to composition. "

CalvinDehaze,funny,1390196399.0,"It's not ""illegal"" in the same sense that child porn and animal porn is. Obscenity is left to local jurisdictions. So Louisiana could think that your simulated incest porn is obscene and prosecute you. If the adult industry thinks that you did't follow their self-regulating rules, your SOL. No help with legal fees, or lobbying. Now, in most states, actual incest is illegal, but it's next to impossible to prove that the two people are actually related, and that the act took place in a state where it was illegal. Even then, a local jurisdiction would have to use discretion before trying to prosecute you. If you're doing niche porn that only a few sickos like, then they're less likely to prosecute you. It's not really effecting their society. But your simulated rape porn is already on volume 23, then they'll take notice. Rape is more of a threat to a society than incest is because less people will be willing to act out incest in real life. However, the way the porn industry sees it, why take a chance? Some cowboy prosecutor could take up the case and next thing you know it's all over the news that there's incest porn being sold in your back yard. Now the porn industry has to fight all these lawsuits, and get another bad tick in it's headboard."

I really dislike that analogy.

If they had the foresight to know it was going to happen, they could release an update before going into administration.

mundabit,birthcontrol,1390196629.0,"Brands &lt;20 micrograms of oestrogen and Progesterone only pills recommend using a backup method if one pill is missed and a double dose is not taken within 24 hours.

An example brand would be Alesse, However the [instructions are not clear](http://www.drugs.com/alesse.html), its states if you miss one pill, just double up the dose and carry on.

I learned incredibly deadly moves like Serpent's Wave and Monkey Picks the Plums, but due to the style's overwhelming deadliness, we couldn't use them in any kind of sparring and I made a solemn vow to my master never to use it on the streets, for fear that people would discover this hidden style, THE deadliest style in the world, and also want to learn how to punch through a grown man's chest or stop them cold with their body's energy field.

pstanish,FeMRADebates,1390196635.0,"&gt; In a Srolian culture (or Srolia for short), gender roles are culturally enforced. Boys and girls are raised differently. Men and women are perceived to have different innate strengths and weaknesses. Gender roles may be enforced by overt laws mandating different roles, or may be a subtle social pressure. Certain professions may be considered ""men's work"" while others are considered ""women's work."" An individual who believes that men and women should be raised differently is Srolist.

I will go out on a limb and say that men and women both have different strengths and weaknesses. Men's most obvious strength is strength, women's most obvious strength is ... well I don't really know, I just sort of assumed they were well rounded, but they probably have at least one strength head and shoulders above the others. I don't think that this is controversial, I also think that we should accommodate the differences in raising children so that we can maximize the number that succeeds.

I think we can all get behind the abolition of laws that specifically enforce gender roles. Unless you have specific examples of laws that do though, I am not going to discuss this point any more.

Subtle social pressure is definitely the tougher side to deal with. I don't really know how to combat this.

Given my belief that both genders have different strengths, I do believe that there are certain jobs that come easier to men (lets say NHL player) and others that exclusively women can do (LPGA player). I would advocate for never telling a person that they cannot do something unless it is impossible, but when a child (because I assume when talking about people being taught it is referring to children) expresses concern that they seemingly have to work harder for the same results that some things come easier to different people and that they may be facing an uphill battle.

Okay Breaking Bad is totally better than The Wire. The Wire is great with ideas and concepts, but it isn't that great with people. Breaking Bad has better characters and dialogue. The Wire is obtuse enough that you feel smart for understanding it, and Breaking Bad is very accessible with it's easy to catch symbolism (The money is in a barrel, like the one they put dead people in. GET IT), and I think that's why people like The Wire more, because they feel like they're in an elite club, but Breaking Bad is better. Ozymandious is the greatest episode of television ever. And The Wire barely even wants to be a TV show, it clearly wants to be a book. Episodes aren't constructed as episodes with three act structure, just a series of vignettes that just kind of end when the time is up.

EDIT: I mean if we're talking ""which show is a better commentary on the drug war"" I go Wire, but Breaking Bad, man. So good. And the balls of Breaking Bad, defusing the entire premise of the show in 3 episodes.

WalterFStarbuck,Games,1390196732.0,"The way IMO to make VATS work is instead of pausing the game you slow it down to something like 1/10th or 1/100th normal speed. That gives you time to choose your shot/punch and use stimpacks, etc.. Apply that slowed-down time to everyone in the party at the same time. It would be amazing to watch the shots as they happen even if I'm not the one shooting. Leave everything but VATS that you'd do on the Pip Boy in realtime unless you're fully paused.

For that you'd need to add an option to request pausing the game and then allow everyone to use their Pip Boys while the game is paused. Allow pausing in combat. We'd all prefer not to be paused, hence the slowed time for VATS, but there's no reason to not have a pause capability too in or out of combat. You'd handle sleeping/waiting the same way. The host player would request we sleep for X hours. 

Make someone the ""Main Character"" and make him/her/it the leader of a small group of survivors. Then it doesn't matter who is who and whether they're always there or not. The only person that matters is the Main Character and that person maintains the save file. If however, you want everyone to have the save file updating, then whoever decides to host is the ""main character"" and in that case you make the story so it doesn't matter who exactly that character is.

In terms of reputation with groups, just maintain an overall reputation for your group. I could see a co-op Fallout game being amazing in terms of there not being a rigid narrative and instead just the wasteland and you and your friends stumble out into it from a Vault and start your own survival group like the Brotherhood of Steel or Novac or Raiders etc... The game wouldn't be about some linear story but growing your group to the point of being the top group in the Wasteland. You do missions, you make alliances and enemies, there are grand works missions, places to loot and convert into a homebase.

It could be amazing. It would take a lot of work, but it would be the greatest Co-Op game I've ever played. As long as it doesn't melt into some MMO bullshit."

Turksarama,australia,1390196747.0,"/r/australia can be a bit of a leftist circlejerk at times, but we still get news posted from both right and left wing sources and have enough intelligent people here to critically analyse them to an extent.  Compare to the 'average Australian' who gets their entire knowledge of politics from one or two news sources and their friends who for the most part likely also look at the same news sources.  If you're trying to picture the average Australian it is better to consider your extended family than your friends as it's typically a less similar thinking group of people.

As for your second point, I wasn't implying that all politicians lie all of the time, but many of them are very misleading a lot of the time and the general population can't seem to tell which ones they are.

Similarly, if you have an awesome resume that you've spent a *long* time working on, you will be rather miffed when it gets you nothing in the way of interviews. You're not entitled to an interview, just as the OP in't entitled to a date.

keakealani,musictheory,1390196899.0,"I have been slowing chipping away at my copy of Arnold Schoenberg's *Structural Functions of Harmony*, which is, so far, a really great read. I think it is actually intended to follow his earlier book *Theory of Harmony* which I imagine is an equally fantastic read and might be a better place to start if you want to get in from the basics. 

Another thought is William Caplin's *Classical Form* which is a really solid (if very narrow) text detailing form and harmony in the classical period. This one is worth noting that it really parses things down to a *very* distilled and narrow idea of form, which most actual music doesn't exactly follow. Still, it has a great way of explaining many concepts and with experience in ""actual music"", can be a valuable supplement to understanding classical form. 

The other topic I have some passing familiarity with (having recently spent a lot of time reading about) is orchestration. In that case, I would wholeheartedly recommend Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's text on orchestration which, even though it is obviously quite old, is still extremely valuable and functions as a great resource. Kent Kennan's text on orchestration is also quite good and is a great counterpart when examining a more modern approach. Samuel Adler's book is very famous and widely used, but I personally haven't found it as useful - I own it because my orchestration class required it, but I always turn to Kennan or Rimsky-Korsakov first, and I rarely need anything in the Adler that hasn't already been said elsewhere. 

I agree completely with /u/Thisglitch that you are probably at the point where you can look at more detailed texts that focus on a specific concept, so it's hard to really recommend an overall ""best"" book. "

 **What kind of people make the best truckers?**
Mostly people who know that being on the road, driving is how you make money and don't need to be home every weekend. Self motivation is big in trucking.
 

**What is an avg day trucking?**
I'll get you a load to whichever area you wanna go and get you the best rate possible.


**What's a very bad day trucking short of an accident?**
Getting shut down by the DOT for log violation etc or truck breakdowns before you deliver the freight.


**What's the next decade holding in store for class A truckers?**
There will always be a big demand for truckers.


**Is the rig comfortable enough for minimalist living?**

**What are must have's on your rig you couldn't go a day without that have to do with living (and not with the job)?**

JohnStamosAsABear,TrueChristian,1390197016.0,"Selling your possessions wasn't supposed to be a punishment or repentance for sexual immorality, its no wonder Paul didn't expect them to sell everything if they were committing sexual immorality. Jesus told you to do this if you were a true disciple. It is echoed in other passages in the bible such as,

Matthew 6:24 - ""No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.""

Luke 12:33-34 - ""Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out, a treasure in heaven that will never fail, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.""

Now according to the article, ""we all fall short of Jesus, yet Jesus expects us to be perfect as he is."" and ""Jesus commands should be viewed as goal posts for us to strive to."" 

So if Jesus' example is something we should strive for, how can someone strive everyday to sell everything you have to benefit the poor? Selling everything you have is nothing like trying to not have impure thoughts. You can't sell everything you own twice. Once you obey Jesus' command it is over. So wouldn't you be using his grace to disobey this command everyday you don't sell your possessions and help the poor?

It's not a very contagious disease at all, unless blood transmission is involved. For every *ten thousand* acts between an infected person and an uninfected person, the rate is only 5-50 cases of transmission. 5 to 10 in ten thousand for everything except receiving anal sex. That's about a .1% chance of transmission for most people having sex, and .5% for anal recipients. And those numbers are [straight from the CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html).

It's stops it because they get caught, and everyone gets tested, and if for some reason someone did catch it (which, again, has never actually happened), it would stop at that first level of infection. There just literally would not be time to spread at all."

Zeak_The_Plumber,FloridaMan,1390197104.0,"I was 17 and still in high school. Imagine being in that awkward phase of still not feeling comfortable working and interacting with the public, now imagine that while wearing the fur of a six foot rat. Some of the kids were psyched to so me and would charge head first into my balls, so they could give Chuck E a hug. Others were not psyched to see me and they'd kick me in the back and try to push me over or yank my tail. I was also the guy who fixed the games, so kids would follow me around like Jesus and try to get a sneak peek inside whenever I'd crack them open. I knew the trick to most of the games, so whenever I'd score a ton of tickets, I would give them to whichever kid seemed the nicest. I loved watching their faces light up over something as trivial as paper tickets.

My personal favorite story was a kid who went on a biting rampage inside the plastic tubes. My mission was to infiltrate the plastic tubes and subdue him and bring him down. I was fully grown by then, topping out at 6'3'' and shimmying on my hands and knees through these tubes like a goddamn soldier in Vietnam. When I finally found the little bastard, he was chomping anyone that came near him. I finally just wrapped my arms around him and slid backwards on my back while clutching him to my chest. We had to slide through probably 20 feet of plastic slide in tandem before we went down the slide (also in tandem).

He was a black kid, so I (racistly?) just walked around to all the black mothers and asked ""Is he yours?"" The answers ranged from ""AW HELL NO, my kids don't act like that!!"" to the simple ""No, he's not.""  

When I finally found chain-chomp's parents they were like ""Oh yeah, he gets to bitin' sometimes.""

Another interesting fact? Testicles will move on their own accord. Not just up and down, depending on temperature, but you may also notice a sort of writhing.

Related to that is the cremasteric reflex. If you stroke the upper, inner thigh on one side, the testicle on that side will shrink up towards the body by reflex.

Kate2point718,Anxiety,1390197571.0,"That's exactly how I feel. I've even been to the psych ward too, but I still feel like I'm only pretending to be sick. I brought this up to a doctor once and he told me he didn't think I was faking since I clearly didn't enjoy where it got me (I was on 24-hour suicide watch at the time, which I *hated*). I still feel that way, though.

I just got diagnosed with OCD after talking with a doctor about some of my symptoms (in the past the suicidal stuff pretty much overshadowed everything else in doctor visits) and now I'm obsessing over whether I really have OCD. I was actually really surprised to see that diagnosis, but now I keep thinking maybe I was faking my symptoms for the OCD diagnosis. Maybe I'm just pretending to obsess over things. (Even though I'm obsessing now.) Maybe my compulsions are made up. (Even though I do them all the time and can't stop--but then I think maybe I'm not trying hard enough to stop doing my made-up compulsions, which doesn't even make sense.) This has been really bothering me lately and I can't stop thinking about it. I've been spending hours every day worrying about it.

I've always had the feeling of being a fraud in other things, too. I did really well in school and graduating 1st in my class, but I'd always feel like it wasn't real, that all my grades and test scores were just flukes and I was deceiving others into thinking I was someone I'm not.

I wish I could stop feeling this way because it bothers me a lot."

Government controlling who can marry? That is pretty liberal. Legislating morality extends government control, and is, by its definition, liberal.

The republican party kind of sucks. Why? Well, because they have a tendency to vote against gay people having the same rights as straight people, they vote against women having the right to decide whether or not they want to continue an unwanted pregnancy. Frankly, that is beyond the scope of the government, and I feel like they have no business stepping into my private affairs provided it does not affect anyone else.

Liberal means you believe the government is responsible for making people equal.

Mr-You,conspiracy,1390197826.0,"&gt;Well then why let the christians out of work for christmas? Why doesn't anyone else get a winter one.

Because roughly 78 percent of Americans identify as ""Christian"". Also many, many businesses do not because they're not obligated to follow Federal holidays.

&gt;The whole business open vs business close thing doesnt make any sense. No one can ever tell who's on and whos off and whats open and whats not. just give the people a day off its worth it

That's because each individual business is free to choose their policies. It's very succinctly explained in the first very short paragraph of the link I posted that you could read if you actually gave a shit and weren't just echoing ""fight da powah"" hollow rhetoric.

&gt;In the United States, a federal holiday is a legal holiday which has been recognized by the US government. Every year on a United States federal holiday, non-essential federal government offices are closed, and every federal employee is paid for the holiday. Private-sector employees required to work on a legal holiday may receive holiday pay in addition to their ordinary wages.

A PS3 and 'a couple of games' is a fair bit to spend on someone for something they didn't say they wanted. It also puts OP in a bit of an awkward position where she might feel obligated to use the PS3 given how much he spent on it, even though she doesn't really want to. Add to that the fact that The Last of Us is 12-15hrs of gameplay and that's a big ask for someone to commit to who has never otherwise expressed interest.

I will look at the article of course.

Edit: 4-part?  I might be missing something, I only saw the one and I am not going to search now.  
I am on my way to bed, so I am not going to get into a huge discussion now about IQ and race.  I am not one of those people who thinks everyone has to be equal and that we are all the same deep down.  But unless there are tons of these families that had adopted black and half-black kids, didn't know which was which, and then miraculously discovered heritage as adults along with IQ tests, I don't really see how we can make too much of a determination.  

I also used to be one of those people who didn't think IQ tests and SATs could be biased.  Then I started teaching at an inner city school.  Then I taught only students who just landed in America.  I would proctor these high-stakes tests that talked about ""kites"" (triangles) ""lawns"" (perimeter) and ""litter"" (puppies, genetics.)  If you have never seen or heard of a kite or lawn, and litter only meant trash, it is crazy time.   It is like when I would get math problems that had to do with sports.  It just read like garbage.  But what about the *basic* questions?  Well, some of our tribal students never considered colors as something with importance or that would have names.  Some did not know numbers.  Many had never held a pencil.  I don't know what type of IQ test that could be designed that would even out these factors.  Even if it is the object orientation type test, the child who had blocks would be at a great advantage.  

The things we *should* be working on are things like the 30 million word gap:

&gt;After four years these differences in parent-child interactions produced significant discrepancies in not only children’s knowledge, but also their skills and experiences with **children from high-income families being exposed to 30 million more words than children from families on welfare**. Follow-up studies showed that **these differences in language and interaction experiences have lasting effects on a child’s performance later in life.**

(Look at the graphs in the link)
http://centerforeducation.rice.edu/slc/LS/30MillionWordGap.html

This lack of early language caused fundamental changes in the brains of these children.

Not only is the amount and variety of words less for the poor children, poor children heard far more negative words:

&gt;Children from families with professional backgrounds experienced a ratio of six encouragements for every discouragement. For children from working-class families this ratio was two encouragements to one discouragement. Finally, children from families on welfare received on average two discouragements for every encouragement.

Also, there was a crazy study done in which students who were asked to write their race at the top of the paper.  Students who identified as black did far worse than when this wasn't asked.  

Head size and IQ is interesting, but once again, measuring IQ is difficult.  But head size can also correlate with pre-natal and early nutrition.  

Anyway, there is too much going on to accurately measure IQ vs race at this point.  And it should be the least of our worries.

There are large sections who will pretty much just listen to whatever someone like Alan Jones tells them. Heaps of people don't really care much about politics until the election comes around and even then its based off slogans and buzzwords. Even beyond that, there are people who vote a certain party because their family does, as if its a bloody sports team.

Not caring too much and being willing to dump your partner will ""work"" to get you the upper hand. I've had previous relationships that adopted that strategy. They made me feel like I was constantly on the verge of being dumped, and it made me a neurotic, miserable wreck. I was less pleasant to be around because I overanalyzed everything they said, got jealous at the slightest hint that they were interested in someone else... basically it was ugly, and neither of us in these relationships were very happy. I won't lie that it was used to significant effect to ""control"" me, but it always ended in flames.

I've also been involved (very briefly) with men who were crazy needy when I wasn't very invested, and yes, that's a major turnoff. Not much to say here - they never lasted, although it tended to end more amicably.

But I've discovered that it doesn't have to be one or the other. That's a myth, that one person in the relationship has to have the ""power"" of caring less than the other. In my current relationship, we are, and have been from the beginning, pretty much in sync in terms of how much we ""need"" each other. It'll zigzag back and forth a tad, but on average it's very much even. I feel loved, secure, and happy, in a way I never did in previous relationships, and we have lots and lots of fun. Just hit the five year mark, and going strong. That's a big part what true compatibility is -- finding someone who wants to be with you exactly as much as you want to be with them. And you'll never find that if you make it a goal of caring less."

cincodenada,dataisbeautiful,1390198401.0,"Hey there - I'm generally the first to grumble about improperly truncated axes, because it can (and often is) deceptive/misleading.  And I did think about that in this case, but decided against it.  There are a couple reasons for that:

* This is a correlation plot, not a timescale plot.  It's comparing two related things, points/game and yards/game, and the correlation/relation between the points in the plot are the main point, not the absolute numbers
* Points/game and yards/game are both a set where zero doesn't really happen - as has been mentioned elsewhere, teams don't get zero points or zero yards over a season.
* The bottom/top teams on the chart are the absolute bottom top/teams in the league, and the differences aren't being exaggerated here - what's important in this data is the difference between the top teams and the bottom teams, not between each team and some hypothetical team that has never played a game.

In this case, I don't think this dataset is something for which zero-based axes make sense.  It just adds a bunch of whitespace for not much benefit - the important data in this chart is how the teams relate to each other, where they are in the ""pack"", and absolute numbers aren't really important.

Truncated graphs are something to watch out for, but it's not a universally bad thing.  Stock market graphs would be completely useless if they were zero-based.  But it can become one of those things like split infinitives or ending sentences with prepositions - something that isn't in itself wrong, but is often done poorly, and ends up wrongly becoming a ""never do this"" thing."
Mephrael,AskReddit,1390198402.0,"&gt;  like he set out to ruin the franchise or something. 

From reading many interview transcripts and a lot of reading between the lines, it seems like Lucas had a vision for the original three movies (IV, V and VI specifically). He was beholden to his producers back then, before the films (and the Indy films) made him huge amounts of money. 

My best guess is that he felt that the ""success"" of the original three films was due to an accident, and because some of his vision hit the cutting room floor, he wanted to re-edit them to be closer to his own vision because he seemed to have the idea that his own vision could have been better than what was released originally. 

Bottom line though, whoever was pushing him during post-production editing was a genius, and IMO Lucas should have just accepted that he wound up with something great and not screwed around with it."

MarkWW,musictheory,1390198507.0,"Too many people, especially 'round these parts memorize scales and modes and think they're learning music theory. They're not.

First, as a single-note instrument player on trumpet and bass (I also play bass) your knowledge of scales and modes helped you craft melodies. That's what modes are - melodic tools. You didn't, however, - to your detriment - learn harmony. Which is a shame, most good bass players should understand harmony and how changing a note in the bass can change the character of a chord.

Knowing music theory when writing a song helps with the ""what next?"" question. ""I have a great riff... what next?"" ""I have a cool chord progression... what next?"" ""I have a simple chord progression that I think can be made even better, but how?""

In my band, I'm the only one who understands harmony, so while the rest of the musicians in the band bring interesting ideas to the table, I'm the only one who can (harmonically) flesh them out into complete songs.

""The song is good, but it lays kind of flat""

Let's try some chord substitutions and extended chords in the verse to differentiate it more from the chorus.

""The verse is good, and the chorus is good, but they don't work together""

Let's try a few connecting chords, and maybe change the verse to a different key.

""I like where the song is going, but it needs some more variety""

Let's switch keys in the bridge and then come up a half step when we come out of the bridge.

A common retort is ""well, those rules don't apply to me, if I only follow those rules, I'll just sound like everyone else"" - which is a huge mistake.

**Music theory - when properly taught - isn't a set of rules, it's a grab bag of ideas.** It's listening to a song and going ""wow that's cool, how did they do that?"" - being able to analyze it, understand it, make it your own, and then use it whenever you're in that same situation.

The same way understanding modes helped you craft melodies as a single note instrument player, knowledge of harmony helps you craft the harmony parts of the song, knowledge of rhythm helps you craft better rhythms and so on. And if you just memorized scales &amp; modes, you only understood a small portion of what each note within the mode does and how it can be used to create tension and build more interesting melodies."
ebonlance,Warmachine,1390198510.0,"My biggest problem with an Archangel pThag list is that from a competitive perspective there are a lot of hard counters to your feat shenanigans. Trolls in general and anyone with access to Carnivore will ruin your day, and RFP effects aren't rare. 

That said, I think pThag is a premier attrition caster and should be played as such. You seem to be going for more of a mobile strike force though - not necessarily the wrong thing to do but not the way I usually run him. Striders with concealment are a pain to peel off of objectives, but this list leaves you without a decent target for Draconic Blessing. 

The other thing that stands out is that your battleground is probably a little bigger than it needs to be. If you're intent on running the Archangel I'd actually cut the Scythean and the Shepherd and put those points toward infantry. Warspears plus UA work nicely with pThag,  but concealment works against them. I'm a big proponent of the Legionnaires with a spawning vessel as a surprisingly effective jamming unit and fantastic target for Draconic Blessing. Farilor is underrated for them too, maybe give that a try. 

All in all you'll be presenting hard targets with a threat of recurrence, a huge base to hide behind, and Sather templates to further discourage enemy movement. It's not a terrible strategy."

The Eve Pearl salmon corrector is supposed to be the exact same thing and works the same way. Some people choose the Bobbi Brown because of the price difference. 

Here is a blog (not mine) about the best concealers: http://www.makeupgeek.com/best-of/top-10-best-concealers/

Right now, Bobbi Brown is having free shipping and returns so you can totally try the concealer kit at $34: http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/product/2335/15950/Makeup/Face/Corrector-Concealer/Creamy-Concealer-Kit/SS11/index.tmpl

I've used MAC concealer and really like the BB set better. 

Also, I was quite hesitant about buying the concealer because of the price. I had a MUA at Nordstrom put it on me, went out with my friends and then saw the pictures that were taken. It was a huge difference. Really worth it IMO."

&gt; I used to teach **college English composition**. I especially loved teaching ESL students because they were eager to learn and didn't see style guidelines as some kind of annoying restriction of their human rights. Teaching can be fun.


Yes, some sentences sound better than others. And there are sometimes patterns to which constructions flow better; by finding those patterns, we can help second language learners figure out the language quicker. So far I think we agree.

But the patterns are just approximations, and the final arbiter of good style should be what ""sounds right"" to the native speakers. It sounds to me like you're putting the cart before the horse, so to speak. You're taking some pattern that you've found (which often isn't a very good approximation in the first place), elevating it to Rule status, and then declaring that sentences that don't follow the rule are bad style. Which leads to constructions as ""educational system""."

inevitabled34th,AskReddit,1390198595.0," I know what you mean. I'm not constantly depressed, but it's just the littlest things that set me off. Usually it's when I get yelled at or ridiculed by a group of people, but it makes me feel so worthless and depressed. Actually, Saturday night I drove home crying because my own mom made me feel unwanted and unwelcomed into their home. I closed my eyes several times while driving at about 55 mph, hoping that I would crash into something so I didn't have to feel anymore. But I'm too scared to do anything to myself. I want the pain to go away and I truly want to always be happy and always feel happy, but when I really think about offing myself, I get scared because I don't know where my soul will end up (I'm an atheist, but I believe in the afterlife. It's weird, I know.). I also know that all the pain that I'm causing my family will only be 10 fold of what it is now if I go through with it. And my fiancee will never move on and be with someone else and she loves me soooooooooooooo much, that I could never do anything to hurt her. I guess what I'm saying is that I get depressed and suicidal some times, but in the end I remind myself of all the things I have to live for.

bleeker_street,AskReddit,1390198850.0,"Do you mean more like current events, or the more broader political culture and context of your country? 

For current events I would start a new agitator online, and fill it with different types of papers - both liberal and conservative, and if possible foreign papers that will be reporting on things in your country for an external perspective.  

If you are looking at the more broad political culture, I guess that depends on where you live.  I took the liberty of looking at your profile, so I'm going to assume you're American. Some basic places to start would include: Intro to American Politics on iTunes, Crash Course American history on youtube, and Yale Open Courses on American studies and politics.  

An important part of stay informed and not misinformed in America is twofold: one using a variety of different sources, and two, understanding how the government works  - who actually holds what powers and responsibilities.  For example, the President gets blamed a lot for the economy.  In reality, the Office of the President doesn't have a lot of sway over the economy.   Mostly the control lays in the hands of banks, investors, and legislatures all over the world.  If there is a government organization that has the most sway over the economy in America it's the Federal reserve or  Congress.  Therefore blaming (or awarding) the President with anything to do with the economy is usually not warranted.  This is just one example of why it's important to know who does what, who can do what, and why. 

Some good resources include:https://www.fileright.com/how-does-us-government-work.html for how things work.  

The books I would recommend included: What's the Matter with Kansas, The Rise of Political Lying (although a UK resource there are definitely some parallels for the US), Howard Zinn's A People's History of the U.S., Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think, Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them, The Federalist Papers, Hegemony or Survival, The Revolution: A Manifesto, Collision 2012, Lakoff's the Political Mind, A Simple Government, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News, Trickle Up Poverty, Decision Points, The Twilight Presidency, The Rise of the Counterestablishment, Sexual Politics, A House Still Divided, New Race Politics in America, God and Race in Politics, Coloured Property, a Righteous Mind, and Things that Matter. 

I realize that's a huge list, but they are all the good books.  The point of reading them isn't to take them at face value, but to see that author's perspective and place it and understand it in the larger context of America, and the world as a whole. 

I hope you enjoy it.  And obviously I'm passionate about this so feel free to message me any time.  "

I'm suggesting that reddit is a series of self-contained echo chambers with little to no substantial dialogue or debate, and the upvote system appeals to the lowest common denominator that succumbs to group identity and gets their opinions from the posts with the most points.

Upvotes and likes won't change the world but attention does, and it's sad how these topics are just not being covered here. People care more about a few isolated cases of police brutality and don't have the nerve to step back and take a look at the bigger picture.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1390198920.0,"/u/Angrybyte is right, it's all subjective :) - and I also agree with him, Some Like it Hot is a down right classic. 

A movie I would highly recommend is Mary and Max. It is in my opinion a fantastic film.

**I recommend a few documentaries as well:**

- ""Kimjongilia"" - Explores life in North Korea and efforts to rescue escapees from the hermit kingdom 

- ""WalMart: The High Cost of Low Prices"" - Explores how WalMart has helped screw over our country

- ""For The Bible Tells me So"" - Explores religion and homosexuality

- ""Food Inc.""  - DO you know where you food comes from? 

**General Movies:**

- ""Capote"" -  Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a brilliant and uncanny performance as Truman Capote ; during the time in Capote's life that inspired ""In Cold Blood"" 

- ""Mary and Max"" (again) - A wonderful tale of two misfits in the world who spark a unique, but albeit strong and much needed friendship while being worlds apart. 

- ""Cry Baby"" - It's camp, it's got Johnny Depp, its just all around fun. 

- ""Donnie Darko"" - A film that one must watch multiple times to grasp the shear size of what actually goes on

**Who enjoys some classics?**

- ""Fargo"" - A Cohen Brothers film it truly is a classic and said to be one of their best films. An all star cast and stellar performances weave brilliantly with excellent story telling complete with drama, and classic Cohen style dark humor. 

- ""Breakfast Club"" - A group of high schoolers from all walks off life, band together in an unlikely friendship 

- ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" - Ferris Bueller is a typical high schooler who decides to take the day off and bum around Chicago while dragging his friends along with him. Hilarity ensues. 

Anyways, I think this list is long enough :P - I spent 2 years living in California and my parents couldn't afford television, or computers, but each week we'd go out and rent a movie when Blockbuster was still around - and many of the films I enjoyed in that time are now streaming on Netflix :D. 

ENJOY!

As for your issues, they're a bit funny honestly. WINE is a program that's designed to make windows programs compatible. It's not perfect, and as long as windows is a moving target it never will be. PlayOnLinux is just supposed to store a bunch of configurations that worked for someone else at some point. It's not perfect either, and never will be.

You could try a different version of WINE (it's already installed as PlayOnLinux requires it), or you could try a different configuration, or a whole bunch of subtle tweaking. Or you could play with drivers, as sometimes a newer or older driver has a slightly different setup that works better for one game or another. [here](/http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&amp;iId=25078) is the page on WineHQ for that particular game.

WalterFStarbuck,space,1390199129.0,"Mars does have big dust storms, but I doubt there is anything significant in the way a typical hurricane can knock structures over. Consider a quick calculation:

The standard air density at sea level on earth is 1.225 kg/m^3 . On Mars it's [0.020 kg/m^3 ](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html). All things being equal (airspeed, blockage area, S, and shape defined by a drag coefficient), the ratio of forces will be equal to the ratio of air densities. That is:

F_Earth/F_Mars = p_Earth/p_Mars = 1.225/0.02 = 61.25. So the force you feel from a gust of wind on Earth is over 60 times the force you'd feel on Mars from the same gust of wind. 

What's interesting though, is that if you wanted to feel the same force on Mars, the wind speed you'd need isn't 60 times higher, it's sqrt(61.25) = 7.83 times higher. So for a 20 mph gust of wind on Earth, you'd need a 157 mph gust of wind on Mars to feel the same thing. 

Imagine how high a wind speed you'd need to move a rock down the road. Say it's gale force winds which are ~40 mph. That's 313 mph on Mars. [From the same source I cited earlier](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html), it looks like dust storms are in the 17-30 m/s (38 - 67 mph) range. On earth, that's 5 - 9 mph.

Definitely the case for academics. It seemed like many of the Straight-A honors students tried to outdo each other in how little they studied or cared during high school. For some reason if someone got an A on an exam after admitting to studying, ""it didn't count."" Similarly, people would show their humility by downplaying their grade by noting how much they studied: ""I only got an A because I studied a lot!""  My pet theory was that our high school (and standardized testing like SAT, I guess), while challenging, wasn't challenging enough to meaningfully stratify the top students, so perceived ""effort"" expenditure became the way of doing that.

This said, I didn't find this to be the case with sports or music. People who were really good at their instrument and took it seriously were respected, as was anyone good at sports."

TRP loves women, in fact, we love them so much we dedicated a whole fucking sub to how to get closer to them both physically and emotionally.

Yeah, many people here are upset with women, but not women as a whole. The problem is modern 3rd wave feminism. Personally, I don't like chicks like this hitting the wall and finally realizing they've wasted their prime because feminism told them to. It sucks. They should have had their shit together when they had the chance to make a better life for themselves. But at the same time, yes, it's bitter-sweet. I'm not going to lie and say I don't feel at least a little joy when women hit the wall after years of living with female privilege (having their cake and eating it too). 

But fuck, can we please just stop denying our social instincts and let the pieces fall where they fit? It's just causing frustration on both sides which is entirely unnecessary. The west as a whole is losing in this game. It's ridiculous. 

I understand a lot of people here are at different levels of taking the pill, but for me personally, I'm at the point where I don't really give a shit about examples or case studies.

YouBWrong,science,1390199430.0,"So many PE teachers are guys who failed as athletes and then failed as coaches.  One of the reasons that they failed is because they weren't smart.  How could a guy like that NOT turn out to be a bully.  

The guy I had in middle school was such a stereotype.  White brush cut and wore sweat pants everywhere.  One year at a sports banquet he gave a speech blaming the team's poor performance on the cheer leaders.

One day in class a guy who had been bullying me for months sucker punched me in the bread basket.  I lost my shit and went all spider monkey on him until he was crying on the ground while I kept on hitting him.  The coach who has been putting up with guys pushing me around for the last two years then starts yelling at me for picking on someone smaller than me (the guy was my height and outweighed me by about ten pounds).  I was still in lost shit mode so I told him to go fuck himself.  He asked ""what did you say"" so I screamed it at the top of my lungs.

I got sent to the vice principals office as punishment.  He knew me though, and he knew the coach and found the whole thing kind of funny.  He just had me sit out the rest of the period in his office.  Got treated like a hero for the rest of the week by everyone in school.

EDITED because spider monkey works as an approach to middle school fighting, but not to grammar."

Serae,AskReddit,1390199491.0,"No, she's not really functioning.  She lives in a house paid for and owned by my grandmother, but she lives alone other than with her dog who has bad behavioral issues (her fault).  She's bad with money, won't work any more and is on limited benefits.  My 86 year old grandmother pays for her and she can't afford it.  Neither can I for that matter. She's so unreasonable to be around that I don't think she could make it through two hours of work without verbally attacking someone.  She says she is two years clean off of drugs and alcohol...but I am not sure.  Her anger fuse is not as short but we still can't be in the same room or on the phone with each other for more than 20 minutes without an outburst.  Sometimes she will bring up things that happened 20 years ago to start a fight.

She's going to end up in one of two boxes.  A cardboard box or a coffin.  :(

  I understand anxiety well and it's caught up with me.  I used to have anxiety to the point of having panic attacks that would cause me to pass out.  I remember losing consciousness once, reaching for my mother to help and hearing her say, ""Stop faking it you little hypochondriac!""  I have them less now but when I have them they are a severe as ever.  I am seeking help for it because I am ready to let all that guilt and fear go.  But I need help doing it.  It's ok to look for help.  I am in a much better and happier place than I have ever been, but I could be better and I want to be.

If you are able to find something affordable speaking to a therapist could help wonders.  I learned to say ""no"" with one and was able to identify that I do no need to live with the guilt and anxiety.  Neither do you.  I know you must feel really, really trapped.  I wish I could advise you on it but I'm not qualified for it.  I think laying out some boundaries for personal space and time could help you a little.  I could recharge from it all when I could hide in my room, draw or read a book and just be at piece.  I still value my alone time as an adult when I get overwhelmed.  Being depressed and sleeping a lot I believe is normal.  I stay in bed for 12-14 hours most day but I can't sleep well as a result of some mom stuff.  Ugh.

I don't personally know anyone who had my upbringing or was regularly beaten or abused by their parents.  What I can tell you is that I would rather a beating then being yelled at.  Getting yelled at could last hours.  A beating was over fast and then I could retreat to my room with ice and/or a first aid kit and be in silence.  After a beating and only after a beating my mother would feel remorse and then she'd try to buy my forgiveness with toys or other things I liked.

I am not sure how coherent that was as I am wicked tired, my apologies is that all seemed to lack structure.

There is a 45w FM2+ APU coming out in a month or so, so if you can wait thats the best way to go.  If you cant wait get a 65w Richland APU.  APUs are a much hotter than CPUs with the same TDP. 

 The a4-6400 is a damn good APU for the price, and if you really want something quad core, the a10-6700 is excellent overall.  Choosing either of these APUs will save you a few dollars which you may want for the HDD.

I  recommend skipping that HDD, and get an SSD.  If you can make do with 110 gb SSD get a refurbished one. If you have other storage on a network drive or something, you can probably make do with the lower storage space until you have the funds to get an additional SSD.

You will mostly be ok with a 200w PSU, but getting a 65w APU will make it even better.

Apparently he only did it the once, and he realized about 20 drinks in that he was serving water instead of vodka. Interestingly enough, no one complained about the lack of vodka in their drinks. 

Edit: Also, had this horrible trainee once. Came in with *apparently* two years bartending experience and refused to listen to a word I said about anything that had to do with work. Told him to make me a gin martini. Without a word, he grabbed the triple sec. I just noped out of there.

I lost it when I came downstairs one night and found Baxter with his head on Rockys bed...Just his head on it. We left it down and he has never fully laid down on it, even though that's all he wanted to do when Rocky was alive. It's been almost 7 years and no one has seen him lay on it. He won't even let the new dog on it. It's kind of heart breaking and adorable.

Going from  normal hair stuff to CG can be fairly drastic - I tried it for a week or so and hated it. If you have the patience, I would suggest buying increasingly milder 'low-poo' products (nonsulphate surfactants and mostly-soluble silicones) every time you buy new shampoo and condtioner.  It's taken me about 6 months since I started transitioning and I'm currently alternating co-washes with low-poos, but I've never had a single bad hair day!

[Here](http://curlgirljourney.blogspot.ca/2009/01/bad-versus-good-silicones.html) is a wonderfully succinct post on non-soluble, slightly-soluble and water-soluble silicones.

The story or atmosphere or depth gets pushed aside to make the game easy to play, or addicting to play, and tempting to buy for the masses.

Billtodamax,fireemblem,1390199909.0,"CHAPTER 29: Time for some motherfuckin' Cog of Destiny. Nino will be promoting this chapter to (finally) give me a decent anima mage.

I can take everyone I want to take because I'm not going to bother stealing shit - I don't need that guiding ring or the money. Hector, Oswin, and Florina are all really high level so I'm going to try not to use them. Raven, Priscilla, and Lucius are going to take the double bridge a little north of me, Lyn and Eliwood are going up the right side with Canas for healing. Dart and Farina lead the charge left, followed by Sain and Rebecca. Rath's gonna stick around the middle and maybe follow them left to hold the point while Farina grabs the village. Nino will float around snagging as many kills as I can feed her.

STRAP IN.

Alright so Lucius/Priscilla tend to take about 1 hit a turn from those generals, who are completely (and rightfully) ignoring Raven. This is basically fine with me, because they're both healers. Eliwood and Lyn are running into the most token of resistance over on the right, and easily clean it up. The left side is having a few more issues, but I still easily get the warp staff with Farina. She also buys me a whole bunch of silver weapons - three of each of the melees, and 1 bow.

Rath has started to gain strength! The lines have moved forwards now, with Sain and Rebecca joining with the fantastic three over in the middle to block off those two paths. Lyn and Eliwood have made it to the two forts, one of which Lyn happily sits on and dodges all the things. I saw a guy with a lance have a 6% chance to hit her using a sword. Canas is there just for healing and heal he will do. He's already got his S Dark, so I don't have to worry about that. Nino has been getting lots of kills by standing behind the fantastic three in the middle and dodging javelins.

Oh shit recruiting Vaida is this mission? Good thing Hector's relatively close to her. I guess Florina and Oswin will see some action this level anyway. Florina's totally at level 15 though, so I kinda want to hold her back.

Rath, Farina, Dart, Sain, and Rebecca reach the area near the boss first, but they don't have a healer with them so I tell them to cool their jets. Nino promotes and heads down to level off some wyvern, while the guys around the boss take turns standing on forts to heal the various scratches they have accrued. Everyone else hauls arse towards the boss. I end turn a few times to make sure no reinforcements are coming, then have Vaida haul Nino up to murder some dudes.

I have everyone sorta just chip away at Lloyd until Sain can roll up and finish him off. Lloyd is one mean motherfucker.

Anyway then Nino whines about the only family she ever knew being dead but I don't see why, she contributed 2 damage to the cause of killing him.

We chat to Bramimond then Nergal totally ganks my dancer. Then Hector finally fucking promotes.

Chapter 30: I don't remember there being anything particularly worth my time in those chests, so I'm not going to bother with them. Normally who to take with Hector would be a no brainer - Oswin and Florina, for their supports. Unfortunately Florina is super high level, and Oswin's pretty up there, so I'm bringing Nino and Canas to get them to support each other.

Okay so apparently there's a spare wolf beil in one of those chests. Nino and Canas are close enough to murder the thief responsible, so it's cool. By this point everyone's poisoned but I don't even give a fuck. Call the cops. When hector finally shrugs off the poison I split the party into Hector and Nino/Canas. Nino will be doing all of the killing in that group because she needs catching up too.

Nino grabs me another Wolf Beil - she's now holding two. Hector grabs an elixir from a chest with a key he picked up from a thief, and the two groups meet up. I have Canas poison himself over and over again so Nino can train her staff rank up to D. She breaks her heal staff and supports up to C with Canas, then I have hector move in on the boss.

Hector boops the boss over the head a whole bunch with his steel sword, then drops his old Wolf Beil for the Tomahawk.

Anyway I get Armads, then Eliwood grabs his shitty legendary weapon and murders Ninian.

WOOPS.

CHAPTER 31: We get to play with all three of our powered up Lords for the first time, yeah! I also get enough room to take everyone I've been levelling, both my thieves, and some useless hanger on! My useless hanger on will be in the form of Jaffar with my almost broken lockpicks, and probably won't actually be useless. My group of 4 shit-fuckers is gonna be Jaffar (to pick open things), Raven, Priscilla, and Lucius. They'll be in the bottom. Their job is to murder Denning, and get the faraway chest. Everyone else's job is to get my theives to that room with two chests.

Then I guess we murder everyone else on the map if we have time. 

Alright so first turn Canas warps Matthew into the treasure room. Objective down, top group is free to murder. Bottom group has Jaffar lure out Dennis, then dogpiles him. Unfortunately Raven gets slept, so Priscilla has to pick him up and run for the treasure with Jaffar behind her. Lucius stays back to solo all of the enemies. Luckily Lucius is awesome so he totally can.

Meanwhile Nino gets fucking silenced so she's useless for like 5 turns. Lucikly there's a lot of shit kickers over there to kick shit in, so I won't miss her. It's just annoying she can't get sweet, sweet levels from all of this. Lucius gets to level 17 at the bottom, which suggest to me that he is murdering entirely too many things.

Anyway, with 8 turns passed, there's noone left on the map. I put everyone in positions that let them ambush any reinforcements, but none show up. Uh. Mission over yeah.

CHAPTER 31x: I don't have Bartre levelled up at all so fuck Karla. Anyway I buy a ton of shit.

You can get it in a variety of places (that was one of the first ones to show up when I looked up the plastic). The plastic can be formed by heat.

jhalton3,ModernMagic,1390200062.0,"I doubt affinity cards will be banned.  It's a solid deck that puts up results often because people don't take it seriously enough.  That said, if it becomes too big of a deal in the meta, in comes the hate and it recedes a bit, at least until people start forgetting about it or writing it off.

What strategy do you like to play?  My advice to you is to play what you like playing, not just what you think is cheap and good.  If you play affinity but aggro isn't your thing you will be very unhappy, even if you are winning.

I currently play Twin and I have RG Tron as well.  It's possible to play budget, FNM playable versions of both of these decks on a budget.  If you decide you like them (or even something more ambitious like 4C Gifts control) and play a budget version you can get into the pricey pieces over time.  It took me a year to build up to the full numbers of fetch lands in my Twin deck, but I played it without them and did fine.  Would I win a GP with it?  No, but I was able to play a deck I liked without breaking the bank.  I even got good at it!

Basically, if you want to play Affinity, go for it.  It's very unlikely to see any bans and it is probably the best aggro deck in the format.  But don't get tied into it because it's cheaper.  Play what you want to play, you will be playing it for a long time!"

redwhiskeredbubul,PurplePillDebate,1390200134.0,"&gt; How can one even fully separate the two? It is human biology (an example: particular areas in the brain that enable language acquisition) that allow for human society to arise in the first place. Male social dominance had to come from somewhere and it sure did not come from aliens.

This is true, but the implied bootstrapping argument (it must be biological because evidence is lacking of an early egalitarian  or matriarchal society, and male dominance (aka patriarchy) is more or less universal,) is weak. It is very hard, both from the point of view of anthropology or biology, to locate human cultural traits as evolutionary adaptations because a.) the time frame of human history is not commensurable with the time frame of evolution and b.) evolutionary and ecological arguments generally do not explain culture very well. 

Basically, we don't know why male dominance exists.  

&gt;It honestly does not matter to me whether -- for example -- division of chores along traditional gender lines being correlated with more frequent sex is caused by society or biology. All I care about is that the correlation exists and whether or not I can use it to my advantage. TRP is strategy, thus when TRP looks at science, accuracy and utility is more important than idealogical implications.

Except that hunting around in the biological or evo psych literature for correlations that are useful _is_ pseudoscience. This is a common dodge with conspiracy theorists also: our bad science shouldn't be judged on the stadards of real science because we're just amateurs interested in the facts, etc. If it contradicts scientific fact and it impinges on science's turf, it's still malarkey whether or not you want to call it science.

By the way, being very depressed is normal for artist/filmmakers. Why not put together a YouTube video where you create an expression of a random page from St John of the Cross (http://www.amazon.com/Collected-Works-St-John-Cross/dp/0935216146) - like for example this random passage:

&gt; We may say that there are three reasons for which this journey made by the soul to union with God is called night. The first has to do with the point from which the soul goes forth, for it has gradually to deprive itself of desire for all the worldly things which it possessed, by denying them to itself; the which denial and deprivation are, as it were, night to all the senses of man. The second reason has to do with the mean, or the road along which the soul must travel to this union — that is, faith, which is likewise as dark as night to the understanding. The third has to do with the point to which it travels — namely, God, Who, equally, is dark night to the soul in this life. These three nights must pass through the soul — or, rather, the soul must pass through them — in order that it may come to Divine union with God.

So make a video of an unrecognizable human figure lit from behind walking around slowly through a city after dark (or use a night filter during the day), where the illuminated signs offer all kinds of worldly things from fancy kitchen accessories to Girls! Girls! Girls! - I'm sure you can find the perfect locations."

Or they may be the product of the breakdown of something else, like wood.  In general, something flammable is combining with oxygen in such a way that it gives off energy, this is where the heat comes from.  The hot gases can then heat the material that is burning, causing more of it to break down, giving of more flammable gases.  
There don't have to be flames, oxygen can combine with hot solid material, e.g. smoldering charcoal.  There doesn't even have to be significant heat; oxygen combines with iron at low temperatures to form rust (but of course that isn't what we would call fire)."

Juz16,PloungeMafia,1390200596.0,"I hate to say it, but this game really left me with a sour feeling towards Plounge Mafia. This game felt like it was much more of a hassle to play than was worth investing into it. The overwhelming number of inactive players*, the non-stop shit lynches on our part, and the extremely OP/lucky/organized/whatever mafia was all very depressing.

I was a vanilla townie, no special powers and no idea what was going on. I voted relatively often, but not on every single trial to keep myself from becoming a target. I was eventually re-assigned as a bodyguard due to the fact that the previous person holding to that role was inactive*. I immediately contacted the Mason's asking for a person to protect. I was chosen to protect /u/-48v, who I later learned was a very important cop.

I died that very same night while protecting /u/-48v due to a shotgun-blast to the chest. Shortly after, I was sent a message asking whether or not I would want to kill or forgive the person who killed me. I knew that I had an opportunity to possibly kill the person who killed me, but I didn't think that doing so would be right after already having a 50% chance to do that. I also felt pretty satisfied that I had protected my target.

Anyways, I looked into the pretty small-scale post game happening on /r/PloungeMafiaGhosties and was dissapointed to find that tons of players were shitty people and chose to kill rather than forgive. I think that's the biggest thing that damaged my view of this game for me. I tend to think that people are good, but that was just crushing to see. I didn't even bother to participate in that game because I didn't want to be let down any further.

[I also had this conversation with someone who was organizing the wraiths.](http://i.imgur.com/fCRza1Q.png) I don't like to think of myself as a sore loser, but I was pretty sore after the ravaging butt-tearing I had experienced here. I think I just don't like unfairness, but I'm not going to argue with anyone who thinks I'm an ass.

I'll definitely play the next game, I hope it ends up being more fun than this. 

gg mafia, lets re sometime

Sorry for acting like a dick at some points, this game was more frustrating than fun.

And in 2011, a 51-year-old Louisiana woman died after using tap water in a neti pot and becoming infected with Naegleria fowleri (commonly referred to as the ""brain-eating amoeba"").

&gt;Given the risk of infection, people with acute sinus infections should avoid using neti pots (or any other type of nasal irrigation device). What's more, all individuals should take care to use only distilled or sterile water when performing nasal irrigation.

Don't just say that. Show it. (That's from the sidebar. [Take a look if you haven't yet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/wiki/dosanddontsprofile) ) You need to expose your own sense of humor to women that read your profile.

Repeating things over and over adds to the blandness. Insert more variety into different sections. Once you put forth a small bit of information, you should move on to talk about other stuff.

Lists are okay in the favorite media section, but I would strive to get rid of a list and talk about what kind of media you enjoy instead.

RG Tron can pull off 7 mana for Karn and start exiling lands, twin targets, goblin electromancers, etc on turn 3.  Alternatively, it has Oblivion Stone online as early as turn 4 most games, which is sufficient to beat most of the combos when on the play.  These results are consistent enough to make Tron a format defining deck.

Blue Tron handles combos with counterspells.

I once tried to craft a ramp deck that didn't use the tron lands.  My intent was to cast a Tooth and Nail for which ever 2 creatures I needed to win (Emrakul, Kiki-Jiki combos, Iona... the list goes on).  The conclusion that I wound up drawing was that you couldn't do it.  I found that Tron was better at what I was trying to do.

So the question isn't ""what is to be done with this new sweet land?"" it's ""is this new land better than just running Tron?""."

GREGORIOtheLION,Advice,1390200980.0,"You shouldn't know how to handle it.  No one knows how to handle such a thing.  But remember this at all times:  it's totally normal to handle it however you handle it.  

I lost my mom when I was 16.  She had diabetes and died of congestive heart failure at the age of 54.  She, like your mom, was practically comatose in the hospital near our home, for about 4 days.  I'll never forget that walk home from school.  I saw my father's truck there (meaning he wasn't at the hospital) and knew instantly.  I was in shock before I walked in the door.  

Don't expect to get over it, but embrace the fact that you'll never get over it.  It took me a while to grow up enough to realize that I was more lucky to have had her for the time I did, than unlucky enough to lose her. 

I'm 37 now.  I got married at 35.  We didn't have a big wedding (We didn't see the need to.  We're practical), and I was so focused on the fact that I was putting a ring on my best friend's finger and making her my wife, I honestly didn't have time to consider that my mother wasn't there.  Don't get me wrong, there are times that my wife will remind me of my mom with some witty remark, and my thought is ""I wish they could've met each other"" not ""I wish she could've seen me get married.""  

Today, I have two moms.  My father re-married shortly after my mother's death (everyone grieves differently.  keep that in mind), and while it took me a while to accept it, I love my step mother.  Also, I call my mother-in-law ""mom"".  It started because I felt odd calling her by her first name, and we were way past ""Mrs. ______"" by the time we married, so I stuck with ""mom"".  And I love her the way anyone would love their own mother.  

I've tried to think of more to say, but I just remembered my own rule in these matters.  You might learn it soon enough.  There's nothing anyone can say.  If you're like me, you'll learn that words are just words, and sometimes people throw around sayings just to try and keep you from crying.  But there's nothing anyone can say.  You'll hear plenty of religious claims as to your mom's new life in paradise, but those are just more words.  

Last words:  Remember her.  Never be afraid of being sad by talking about her.  At some point, your memories of her will become saturated with all the good things, and any bad things (if any) will be filtered out with time.  She will become larger than life in your thoughts.  Pass this on to your kids.  Make sure photos are always around and cherished.  Most of all, be ready for this storm and know that your umbrella might not be big enough, but it's totally ok."

Berean_Katz,DebateReligion,1390201019.0,"I think it's pretty obvious that if a Christian heaven *did* exist, we would lose our free will when we got there. The reason is simple: If I were to go to heaven (which I highly doubt), I would go to heaven knowing that my older brother is an atheist. This would mean that through the revelation of an afterlife, I now know my brother will end up burning in hell for **all eternity**, simply for his disbelief in Jesus and not for his moral character (somehow this seems perfectly logical to many Christians). 

Heaven is supposed to be eternal bliss. If this is true, then I cannot feel sorry for my brother. I cannot grieve for my brother. No matter what happens to my brother, I will be forced to be happy *forever*. THIS is loss of free will. This means that all the people I love and care for who disbelieve in Jesus now mean nothing to me. I'll just smile ignorantly as if everything were OK for them. So either God made heaven so joyous that I could care less about their fate (which I doubt), or he blocks off the part of my brain that empathizes for the people I love and cherish. If this is how God wants us to spend an eternity, count me out. 

You might say, of course, ""Then why didn't you convince him to become a Christian when you had the chance?"" Because I'm *not* a Christian. I refuse to believe in something with such bad evidence. But let's say that God was real. I wouldn't want anything to do with him, judging by his character portrayal in the Bible.

The thing is: this isn't just a personal appeal to why heaven takes away our free will--it's right there in the book. (**Revelation 21:4**). ""We will never feel sorrow."" Sure, John of Patmos...whatever you say."

Economic ideas get more attention, sure, but lets face it a lot of people don't know what they're talking about there. They'll just hear Hockey talk about cutting debt or ending 'handouts', combined with the LNP's talk of a supposed crisis and think that it sounds about right.

Personally, I don't think it has to do with them beating the game as others are saying.

It took the servers 10 minutes to delete the entire SAO world, so we can assume that the timing is not correct.

That only leaves 2 options, I can see. One is that, like Kirito, they will to live over powered the program and they stayed alive. The other more plausible option is that Kayaba kept them both alive because their mental capacity was able to surpass his programming, we all know Kirito lived to kill him but many people over look that Asuna removed the paralysis by will-power alone as well.

steve496,49ers,1390201491.0,"Kap, Aldon, Crabtree, and Iupati - the 4 big contracts that will most shape our cap - aren't up for another year.  Justin Smith got extended last offseason so has 2 more years.

We have 5 free agents of substance this offseason - Boldin, Whitner, Brown, Goodwin, and Dawson.  Goodwin is almost certainly gone, and Brown seems unlikely to return; the other 3 will come down to money.

In terms of cap casualties, there's only 3 significant players that seem particularly likely: Carlos Rogers, Glenn Dorsey, and Frank Gore.  And as far as I can tell I'm in the significant minority in listing the latter two as possibilities.

Basically: our secondary will be getting rebuilt.  We'll swap out a few players on offense.  And obviously we're likely to have a hole at ILB following today's game.  But I'd expect our Opening Day starting lineup to include something like 17 out of the 22 people we started today - and one of the changes will be due to a starter returning."

Lessen penalties for small amounts, and treat users as people with sickness rather than criminals. Maintain a hard stance toward illegal trafficking and dealing though.

Prostitution- Legalize it, but regulate it heavily similar to Nevada.

Illegal immigration- Conditional amnesty. Must have no criminal record, be in the US for a certain amount of time, and must pay taxes or serve in the military or civilian public service equivalent before even being eligible for citizenship

Prisons- Reverse privatization.

**Economic**

Healthcare: Single payer healthcare. Scrap Obamacare.

Taxes: 40-45% flat tax on all earned income, capital gains (with a 40-45% deduction for capital loss), and corporate tax. Close all loopholes (for details on why I do this, see my section on welfare reform).

Welfare reform: Eliminate all social programs, cutting the federal budget to $1.3 trillion. Replace them with a universal basic income of $15,000 a year for all adult citizens (and maybe a smaller amount for children if we can fit them into the budget). Combine with universal healthcare.

Minimum wage: Given my basic income proposal, keep minimum wage as is. 

Energy: Continue using fossil fuels for now, but heavily invest in sustainable alternate forms as well so we can wean ourselves off of oil.

General: Continue to fight for worker rights, support unions, etc. Perhaps add European style vacation time and other benefits to the mix.

Wall street: Prosecute bankers who caused the recession. Add regulation to never allow 2008 to happen again.

**Governance**

Campaign finance: reform the system, add constitutional amendments similar to the law in another topic to limit campaign contributions to a level similar.

Lobbying: Add stricter rules to inhibit corporations from dominating agenda, perhaps based on time. Alternatively, they must spend so much time listening to the concerns of average citizens rather than being immersed in upper class agenda.

Gerrymandering: Replace current system with shortest split line redistricting or similar computerized redistricting method to make redistricting objectively done rather than done for political gain.

**Foreign policy and national security**

-Withdraw troops from Iraq and Afghanistan if not done by 2016.

-Scale back, but do not eliminate our military bases around the world.

-Do not intervene unless necessary or vital to our national security.

-Reduce our military budget somewhat, but do not cripple our military doing it.

-Either eliminate or place strict restrictions on NSA spying program

-Continue using drones as we have been doing. Better than putting people in harm's way.

**Other issues**

-Education- increase federal funding to impoverished city schools, since these schools cannot raise the revenue on their own.

-Space exploration- It can wait until after the recession.

-Infrastructure- perhaps establish a public works program to improve it.

Climate change- As I said with energy, focus on trying to get off of oil and other dirty fuels. Continue adding regulations as needed, and enforce them. Penalize businesses for accidents like BP oil spill or that nasty business in West Virginia.

Budget: My basic income approach with the tax rates should just about balance it, but with public works programs, we may need to spend some additional deficit spending before things get better, but seeing how this is a recession, it'll be okay for now. After recession ends, we can talk about cutting back where possible or raising taxes."

---

However, many Protestant denominations practice *monastic retreats*. This includes ""camps"" gone to during late childhood, men's/women's/marriage retreats, and so on. They are temporary ""mountaintop"" or ""wilderness"" experiences, not permanent lifestyles.

We see biblical models for this, such as Christ's 40 days in the wilderness. Very different from whole-life monasticism."

Eagle-Eye-Smith,AskReddit,1390202327.0,"&gt; Why does a set of physical processes experience the painfulness of pain, the redness of red or any other subjective experience or qualia? Why doesn't all this information processing simply happen 'in the dark' so to speak?

What does this question even *mean*?

What are you talking about?

The ""redness"" of red? What is that? What does that even mean? Are you asking ""why is pain felt **this** way? Why isn't it just a number appearing on a GUI interface in front of my eye?""

&gt;Arguably, we could still behave the same, we just wouldn't experience consciousness - we would be zombies, **automatons**.

I don't see any evidence to the contrary. Why is that false? Because we have a different set of reactions which we named ""feelings""? If anything, these things make us even **more** like automated machines- Feelings are completely automatic responses, they're knee-jerk, a reflex- you don't make a conscious decision to ""feel"" something, you just do- a completely automatic reaction to an action.

&gt;Even when we explain the structure and behavior of every single neuron in our brain, when we figure out the performance of every single process happening in the brain, when we can build our own brains, we might still be faced with the same problem

Huh? If we completely understands why and how our brain works, how it reacts to anything and everything, why would we face the same problem? An electron is an electron, a neuron is a neuron, they don't work on ""magic"", they work based on consistent laws of nature. And if you knew every single interaction between every single neuron in your brain, what exactly would stop you from defining consciousness? "

AccountHaver25,FeMRADebates,1390202339.0,"&gt; Is western culture an example of a srolia?

Yes

&gt; What causes srolism to develop in a culture?

It's easy to divide society by assigning the two binary genders certain roles. That way it is easy to divide up the labour. Of course many societies recognized non-binary genders as well but not many Western ones.

&gt; If our modern culture is srolian, what are the historic and recent causes of srolian thinking?

The fact that ingrained societal differences are hard to leave behind.

&gt; Is human biology a factor?

Women are 100% cis and men who are 100% cis (majority of the population and many trans* people pretended to be 100% cis) are more likely to have biological differences. So biology is a factor.

&gt; What are the positive effects, evolutionarily, historically, and currently?

Division of labor made it easier to run a society. The kids would be raised by a mom and the money would be provided for by a dad.

&gt; What are the negative effects?

Reinforcing the current system. Rescritcing men who want to be a dad and women who want to the breadwinner. Society saying the only correct way is to be this isn't good.

&gt; Is it different in the western world than in developing countries?

Srolism in developing countries is more enforced. Especially with the rising anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment in much of the world. It isn't just due to slorism but it is a factor.

&gt; Should we be fighting against srolian ideals and morality?

Yes. It erases trans* people, it pressures people to choice things they might not be comfortable with, etc. "

Berean_Katz,DebateAChristian,1390202388.0,"A few points here:

First, it seems like you might be saying that ""you can't disprove God."" This may be true, to a certain extent. But you can't disprove the Flying Spaghetti Monster either. The burden of proof is on the person making a claim. You claim that God exists. Prove it. If you claimed that Bigfoot existed, would you demand me to prove that he *doesn't* exist? No, because you are the one making a positive claim, therefore you are the one responsible for convincing me your claim is correct.

Second, what ""evidence"" do you speak of? As far as I can tell, no such evidence exists. Miracles haven't been proven, and studies have suggested that prayer doesn't work. I figured you'd ask for a link, so: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/31/health/31pray.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0

Third, the mere fact that you're a scientist doesn't mean anything to the evidence of God. That's an appeal to authority. What type of scientist are you? Because science is a *very* broad field. If you are a creationist (and I'm not saying you necessarily are), then I highly doubt you specialize in biology.

AssaultKommando,FeMRADebates,1390202760.0,"A quick look at (western) file sharing sites will reveal a goodly number of Japanese productions and concomitant hits, so arbitrarily limiting the sample group to western productions seems like an disingenuous attempt at gerrymandering.

That being said, you could make the argument that consumption of Japanese porn by westerners is a result of their fetish for Asian women. It's pretty hard to get into owing to the differences between expected behavior for women in sex (female Japanese pornstars basically lie there and squeal a lot and the males have to do all the work), but I suppose people who buy into tropes about ""submissive"" Asian women might find that a turn on.

Anyway, I just think that people who constitute an exotic minority in a culture dominated by another group are bound to be fetishized. That was the point of bringing up the reverse situation in Japanese porn.

I'm not sure porn's focus on the male audience is a real problem either; that's rather akin to men pissing and moaning about literotica and chick lit. If we're to speak in broad generalities, the sexes have different preferences and the producers of their preferred media will pander to the tastes of their target audiences, which will necessarily alienate those whose inclinations don't resemble that of the majority in said demographic group. I don't like chick lit and resent its influence, but that's perfectly ok because it wasn't intended for me in the first place."

Light margarine, bland cooking, but tons of sugary juice in the house.. and my dad got fat from beer. heh. These days I'm teaching her the joy of cooking with fat (sensibly of course).

Sornos,DaystromInstitute,1390203179.0,"I think there are two possible outcomes. One good, one bad.

The good is that killing Dukat may have ended the Occupation sooner. He was the last Prefect overseeing the occupation, after all. His death may have been the final straw for the High Command. Bajor would have been freed years earlier, but the Emissary would have never found the Celestial Temple if that had happened. 

The bad is that the High Command would have sent a replacement for Dukat and one that would certainly have been less ""sympathetic"" to the Bajoran cause as Dukat was. He was an arrogant ass, but he was right about how merciful he was. It could have been a lot worse. A real hardnosed Prefect would have executed droves of Bajorans in order to keep the peace. Dukat didn't and if he had gotten killed for it, a new Prefect would make up for that mistake. 

But since the Emissary was always planned to discover the Celestial Temple after Bajor was freed, what Kira would have done doesn't really matter since the Prophets had already outlined a path for what was to come."

- The midrange bass can be cleared up with a simple EQ, try and drop out a lot of the mids (200 - 500hz) and, if at all possible, add some high end trough saturation/distortion to maintain it's presence
- The kick can be boosted a little bit in it's fundamental (I'm feeling like this one would be 90-100hz or thereabouts) and slightly at the higher end to get more of a click out of it, all whilst still maintaining the overall feel for the track"

And without getting too into the whole indoctrination theory, whether the child Shepard saw in Vancouver was actually real is up for debate so there's that as well. IMO fanart of Shepard punching the Starchild is much more about a desire to have Shepard end the trilogy on his/her own terms rather than choosing from the smorgasbord of bullshit presented by the Starchild.

Riali,ABraThatFits,1390203910.0,"Your measurements do indeed indicate a 30D/DD.  However, since cup size is a ratio, not static, a 30D is actually the same volume as your 34B, and a 30DD is one size bigger.  As your current bra is too small in the cup (Your bigger side is pushing the foam out of shape, and the wires are resting on breast tissue on the sides.) 30DD is definitely the place to start.  It will not be nearly as big as your head.  In fact, the cultural idea that DD is huge is entirely false.  It's a 5 inch difference between bust and underbust, meaning each breast is going to stick out around 2 inches.  Fairly modest, in the grand scheme of things.  [Here's a collage of properly fitted D and G cups, for your reference](http://i.imgur.com/z9PGMnP.jpg?1). The 30DD in the nude bra with the pink floral embroidery looks quite similar to you to me.

kn33,explainlikeimfive,1390203944.0,"You kind of said it. Because storage. Let's say the structure of a saved tweet is this:  
Username (max 15 characters) [enter character]  
tweet (max 140 characters) [enter character]  
url (max 2000 characters safely)  

If you take (15[username]+1[enter]+140[tweet]+1[enter]+2000[url])=2157  
Now this is rough because I don't know the exact structure of a tweet, but I'm hoping that the extremely long URL will be compensation for anything I miss

Now, with Google, I've determined that tweets are encoded in UTF-8, where the maximum size for a character is 4 bytes. Therefore, 2157*4=8628  

**That means each tweet is 8628b**   
Now, let's look at the price of storage. I found a new 1tb hard drive for $55. Assuming twitter uses RAID to keep their data safe, we'll go with two hard drives. That means every 1000000000000b costs twitter $120 (bumping up to account for rough estimates thus far). That means that they can store 115901715 tweets on 1tb, or get **965847 tweets per dollar** for storage. Make sense how they can manage it now?  

Let's furthermore take the statistics of 58000000 (58 million) tweets per day. That means that they are paying **$60 in tweet storage space every day** If you go by the rest of the above, that's **more than a terabyte of tweets every day**. Kind of mind blowing, but affordable for big corporations."

MightySasquatch,minnesotavikings,1390203967.0,"I mean, if you take the winner from almost any super bowl and work your way backwards you can find a way to justify it through what the NFL would want.

Why didn't the jets get in during their two AFC championships, when they're in one of the biggest markets with a popular coach?

The other thing to remember is these are the teams that had the two best records in the AFC and the teams which had I think 1st and 3rd bets records in the NFC. So it's not at all unrealistic that they'd both make.

Definitely still makes for interesting football, and I'm glad that evil lost this year."
galindafiedify,BuyItForLife,1390203972.0,"I've had mine for about a year now and I absolutely love it. I mainly bought it because I fell in love with the aesthetic of it after seeing it in a magazine. It wasn't until after I purchased it that I realized just how long it would last and what great quality it was. As long as you condition the leather semi-regularly and beware of rain it should last forever. 

The only thing I'd be concerned about is the amount of weight it can carry. I own the Classic 14"" and it's already quite heavy and full with just my wallet, compact mirror, mini makeup bag, phone, keys, and notebook. I feel like the strap is too thin to really hold up to a lot of weight. I'm not too sure a laptop would work well if you're also planning on filling the bag. The leather doesn't really have much give so the bag is quite narrow. 

Overall I really am happy with the satchel and it's going to last forever. Let me know if you have any questions!

EDIT: I just saw you need it to fit a 15"" laptop. That probably won't work with the regular satchel. It might work with the 15"" Batchel but I'm not too sure about that."

savoytruffle,applehelp,1390204257.0,"To expand on what /u/od_9/ says, the game can treat the display as 1280x800 and everything will be doubled in each direction and it'll look exactly the same as it would on a non-retina 13"" MacBook Pro because each logical pixel will take up exactly four physical pixels.

But since the resolution of the screen actually is 2560x1600, you could experiment with higher resolutions. Even non-optimal scaling might be good or better looking since the pixels are so small.

I think the Blizzard games have all been updated very well to support Retina Macs so you'd have options like this inside the game."

Aircraft fuel will expand as it heats ups, so if to much fuel was put into the aircraft, and then the temperature rose, this can happen. Aircraft have several fuel tanks in both the wings and the body, so maybe the fueler forgot to switch to body fueling and accidentally put to much fuel in the wings instead. 

I used to work as an aircraft fueler, and Captians would often ask for an extra 200 LBs of fuel on their flights, just in case. If some idiot put, say, 1000lbs of extra fuel onboard, or didn't properly distribute the fuel throughout the aircrafts fuel tanks, this could easily happen. Aircraft fueling doesn't have any personal certification involved by the FAA, so I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often. "

I think it has to do with the amount of energy you're able to spend on the day. I know myself that when I'm having a ""Good day"", I'm spending vast amounts of energy on being socially aware and active, and I can feel the drain on my reserves after about 6 or 7 hours.

 I have to spend the day after recuperating, so I'm a bit more quiet and reserved than usual as I try to wrangle up the mental energy to have another Good Day.

If you can prep yourself for the day, try some affirmations in front of the mirror, and positively self-reinforce, it helps in a big way.

As well as the move from description to dialog / monolog - action and and movement of the plot effortlessly . ""Badly written"" would be pointless descriptions like listings in a catalog - ones that go on pointlessly, dialog that goes on pointlessly and authors that almost shout "" We are moving the plot along now , see?

Might offend some but, Dostoyevsky in not good to me and I  could not finish it because his pointless descriptions for description sake, places and  things and characters and their six russian names and who they know and where they work and how many kopeks they had and then they vanish pointless toward the plot in any way.

tomanonimos,legaladvice,1390205206.0,"The 7 days notice of eviction is legal under Michigan law
&gt;A 7-DAY NOTICE is required for the 
following reasons:
a) Nonpayment of rent;

It is a 30 day notice of eviction when 
&gt;c) Holding over after natural expiration of 
lease term;

Since your lease has ended  the apartment complex can legally evict you but they have to give you a 30 days notice. What you can do is go talk to the Regional Manager in person with your records and show them it. I would recommend you dont leave until they give you a written statement showing that the current check pays for the first 3 months (essentially allowing you to live there for three months). 

You are correct where it is required a landlord must have a rented property in a habitable condition; since the landlord has already called in a maintenance man for you, I cant see how you can use this against them. 

My personal opinion: You should look at other housing options since it seems the apartment management has it out for you and your apartment is run-down. 

Oh and if the problem is only with Jan 2014-March 2014 rent and Oct 2013-Dec 2013 than you only need the last two checks (three if you want to play it safe)

&gt;The characters were so popular though they thought it would be suicide so they started writing more with them and scrapped what they originally were going to do.

I got a different vibe out of it and from articles around the time, the point of the first season was that they were all lost in any number of ways, which is fine for one season but when you've *solved* that season's problems it's just inexcusable to stick conspiracy upon conspiracy to keep the characters in the dark.

Basically they thought the 'lost &amp; unsure, story of exploration and fucking up' thing was what made the show popular and just went off from there. It's kind of the same shit that happened with Lost. The story just never went anywhere."

Noumenon72,bodyweightfitness,1390205508.0,"It's definitely close, from watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKb-rSzxQjY) and trying the move I'd say the difference is 

* reaching over with the right hand instead of hanging a weight down with the left hand contracts a lot more oblique abdominal muscles

* bending the left leg and lowering the back leg (compared to sticking the back leg out straight and hinging at the hips) is a lot less of a workout for the back muscles.

I wonder if it is a legitimate exercise at all or just something Herbalife made up. I'll try to get more info about the video if you guys don't guess it."
mandrewradams,TumblrInAction,1390205511.0,Ya know what I find offensive? People that appear to champion not offending people when all they're really doing is trying to make themselves feel superior.

Doctor_of_Recreation,sex,1390205551.0,"I think it's not too challenging, to be honest.  Don't blow up over something sexual, have conversations about safety, etc.  One of the things my parents told me in high school was that while they'd rather I waited, they would infinitely rather I had sex in safety, and that I could do it in my parents' home if the alternative was something dangerous/risky.  My parents were very open about their intimacy (not always in a gross way, although my mom is definitely a little less private than I'd like).  They were not afraid to kiss around us or anything like that.  They never made us look away when sex was displayed on TV or in movies (if you don't freak out about it, your kids won't wonder what the big deal is).

I guess it worked for my folks because I didn't lose my virginity 'till I was out of high school even though I had opportunities.  I am glad that my parents treated sex the way that they did.  Even though I was never really ready for it, it was very comforting to know that while my parents wouldn't really *like* it, they would at least make sure that I was protected and healthy.  Plus a lot of the mystery and intrigue was removed by their openness."
