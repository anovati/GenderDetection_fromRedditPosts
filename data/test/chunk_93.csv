ScubaSteeeve,dynastywarriors,1391020648.0,"You're choosing two weapons with the same element. Have you played the tutorial yet? It's under Story Mode.

Basically, there are three elements: Heaven (blue), Earth (green), and Man (red). They're a rock-paper-scissors configuration where Heaven beats Earth, Earth beats Man, and Man beats Heaven. Each enemy officer in the game has one of those elements assigned to their weapon when you fight them. Since you get to choose two weapons, it's best to choose two weapons that have different elements so you can be prepared for any situation.

On their own, the elements do nothing; but when you're fighting an opponent with a weapon that trumps yours, you'll see a ""!"" symbol above their head. You can still damage them, but your attacks won't faze them, and theirs will do extra damage to you. When they do a charge attack, there will be some blue particles coming from their body. This is your cue to hit them with a switch attack (R1, assuming you're using PS3). This is a counter that will not only damage the enemy, but give you bonuses to your attack for a short time. So, it can sometimes be useful to actually use a weapon that is trumped by your opponent's and simply wait for an opportunity.

If your weapon is of the same type as the enemy officer's, then there are no effects or special attacks that open up.

If your weapon is of the type that trumps your opponent's, you'll see a blue triangle above their head. As you attack your opponent (not even necessarily damage; they could block all of your attacks and this would still happen), parts of the triangle will chip away. Once it disappears completely, your next hit will trigger a special attack called Storm Rush where you wail on your enemy over and over again, also drawing in any nearby enemies (including any officers whose weapons might be stronger than yours). Mash your attack button while this is happening, as it causes your attack speed, and thus the number of times you hit your enemy, to increase.

Besides the game's warning, there's nothing stopping you from picking two weapons with the same element. But I don't recommend it... about one third of the enemy officers you fight will do extra damage to you and not be fazed when you do hit them."

ashwinmudigonda,india,1391020658.0,"You appear to be a young ABCD (early 20s max). If you're really interested in studying (note: not learning) tradition, you should hit the books.

I, too, was like you - eschewing everything Indian, and wanted to be known as an iconoclast. But, as a scientist, you are always questioning established rules, and once you start questioning deep enough, you begin to see a hint of rationale. I am not saying every tradition makes sense, but some do.

There is a line of thought that ancient Hinduism was very scientific in its approach, and logical, but that is lost over time.

Consider this: if today, 90% of humanity were to be wiped off, and the remainder 10% repopulated the earth, in a couple of generations, going to the moon, operating the internet or power stations, everything that we take for granted today will be lost. We will have nobody to transfer the knowledge forward. But when the third generation children walk up to a giant telescope, they'll know that it existed, but not know what its purpose was.

To some degree, current day Hinduism is like that. At least, IMO. I have continued to question tradition, but I am now a more willing listener to the reasons, even if they make little sense.

EDIT: 

Another example that's more tangential is the act of sitting at the temple for a few minutes before leaving. When I was a kid, my grandma would take me to temples (in Madras) and once we were done praying, she would sit down under a tree inside the temple, and ask me to do the same. She said, ""It's good for you,"" but obviously she never explained why.

My hypothesis is that you weren't just supposed to sit, but to meditate for a bit. Now, the discovery of the benefits of meditation is a highly active research field in the US. Just 12 minutes of contemplation every day has shown to make the brain plastic again. That area is littered with journals, and you can look it up. But the point is that meditating is no longer considered a hippie froofy BS. It's valid science.

And it's something that Indians have known for ages. It's stuff like that that makes me realize that science can be pretty arrogant at times too. It's not necessarily humble. For example, Stephen Hawking came out last week and said that there were probably no Black Holes. Contemporary astrophysics postulates that there could multiple universes. All these were laughable a decade ago, but are now serious science research areas.

It could very well be that we will reach the same level of advancement that our Indian forefathers once might have had. After all, estimating the trajectory of satellites and performing differential equations requires some level of scientific merit."

Rossegut,worldbuilding,1391020660.0,I love this idea. I'd read a book about it!
strangestdude,PurplePillDebate,1391020660.0,"&gt;But even that article you cited supports what I've said.

It doesn't, it talks about how the behavior standard discriminates against boys because boys are more prone to acting outside that standard. It states it's a norm that girls conform to far easier than boys.

The other article spoke about female teachers regularly grading boy pupils lower than external examiners. And seeing as women make up the overwhelming majority of teachers that's a very ominous study.

&gt;I don't know why you expect feminists to take up the mantle for childhood education reform. Parents do that because they care about their kids.

Feminists like yourself won't. But there are feminists like Christina Hoff Sommers who do - because they see it as a gender issue.

I personally suspect that if the stats were reversed you would be trying to change things for boys and men. I believe that because you are actively trying to encourage women to go into engineering because the are 'under represented' - whilst ignoring that the same is happening overall in education, but boys are on the worse side. 

TBH I don't expect much from feminists, I've come to the conclusion that most feminists have a hard time empathizing with men's social experiences and issues. I don't think it's there fault though, I think traditionally we are trained to treat men's suffering with invisibility or dismissal. I think traditionally we have treated men as disposable (eg. drafting and encouraging men to go to war).

The amount of feminists who shrug their shoulder when I bring up that men make up the majority of victims of violence. Their rebuttal is usually; men make up the majority of perpetrators. To them the victim sharing the same gender as the perpetrator somehow justifies a lack of awareness and compassion. 

&gt;Women lacking suitable partners will cause education reform in elementary school? 

Yes.

People have to go through mandatory schooling to get to college/Uni ofc, if people fail at mandatory education they can't go to college/Uni.

When women complain about 'where have all the good guys gone' they will look at why there are a number of men who are don't have an equivalent education. 

I watched an ABC news piece about single black 'successful' women unable to find partners - and one of the reasons cited was the lack of black men with equivalent education, which is what these women wanted.

Here is the piece;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWTXhHABj_A

&gt;Because you want to look at this as a gender issue,

If you disagree with me looking at the education gap as a gender issue, then I invite you to encourage feminists not to look at domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, sexual objectification, etc as a gender issue - seeing as all genders are affected by those issues.

&gt;A massive shift to caring about men's issues? Why are you isolating them when childhood education affects everyone? Including girls?

You are a feminist who campaigns for women's issues? So why are you isolating issues that affect everyone, like domestic violence, rape, sexual assault, sexual objectification, etc. You are probably isolating them because women make up the majority of victims. I focus on men and boys in education because they make up the majority underperformers.

Every gender has issues, but you are choosing to focus on one. I'm confident you would argue that doesn't mean that you don't care about other genders. 

So I don't know why you aren't affording me the same respect for focusing on one gender's issues that you give to yourself.

&gt;We can agree to disagree but you're not going to solve the problem if you don't understand it.

Simply because you disagree with my interpretation of the education gap doesn't mean I don't understand it - it means I don't understand it in the way you want me to.

What makes me think Bronn can take him is Bronn's estimation of his own skills. More than anything, Bronn is smart enough to pick his battles. The book quotes the saying, ""there are old sellswords and there are bold sellswords, but there are no old bold sellswords."" Bronn is an old sellsword. He knows when to pick a fight, he knows when to walk away, and he knows EXACTLY what he's capable of. He demonstrates an ability to correctly estimate a fighter's abilities both in his battle with Ser Vardis, and when he runs the training program for the gold cloaks in the book.

So if we trust that Bronn's estimation of his own abilities is accurate and free of exaggeration, it suddenly becomes clear that he has quietly become one if the finest swordsmen in the kingdom. Note that in the book, he gives himself a fairly good chance of beating The Mountain in single combat. He doesn't take the risk because it's too dangerous--one slip and he dies, and Bronn doesn't see any reason to risk his life. But he still indicates that he's capable of it--I think that puts him at least on the level with the Red Viper, who is widely feared. Meanwhile in the show, Bronn seems perfectly unafraid to walk into a fight with The Hound, ALSO one of the finest swordsmen in the Seven Kingdoms.

Meanwhile, Jorah is repeatedly described as mediocre. Even Dany thinks of him as more of an advisor than a warrior. His value to her is in his knowledge of politics and his understanding of the Seven Kingdoms. When Dany needs a fighter, she sends someone else."

It was brought before the supreme court and shot down because of an anti-feminist campaign. It's always been the policy of NOW that they oppose sex-specific selective service and are in favour of either abolishing it altogether or making it non-gender specific. Because selective service is such an unlikely possibility in this day and age, fighting it would waste resources that could be used toward other things, especially since selective service is essentially a difference that only exists on paper.

And we know that he's a smart fighter. So we can assume that he's pretty capable. However, he doesn't have experience fighting in heavy armour. I think this is what seals it for Jorah.

Jorah is a big, strong dude, and at least a competent fighter (fought on the trident, at pyke etc). And he has plenty of experience in heavy armour. People point to his fight with the Dothraki bloodrider, but forget that the Dothraki have a reputation as being goddamn dangerous. The bloodrider could have been fast as hell by westerosi standards.

I think Jorah takes it because of his better armour. Bronn struck me as being a better swordsman than Jorah when I read the books, but Jorah isn't likely to make the same mistakes as the vale knight and won't tire out the same way. Bronn lands a few hits but fails to get through the armour in any significant way, and Jorah eventually cuts him down. Jorah 7/10.

Also, saying that someone did something ""because of their insecurities"" or ""because they were jealous"" is not an insult, it's a description. It's giving a reason for why something happened.

Russian_Surrender,changemyview,1391020778.0,"This is the right response. I'm a relatively new cyclist (~ 6 months) and my attitude is basically ""I'm going to do whatever is safest for me, regardless of what the law says"".  If I get a ticket keeping myself safe, so be it.  It's the cost of being a cyclist.

And what you describe on stop signs and red lights is basically what is known as ""the Idaho stop"".  It says that bicycles can treat stop signs as yield signs and red lights as stop signs.  It makes a lot of sense.

And I think that's the only issue I have with the OPs argument.  I agree that bicycles should follow the laws, but **certain laws should be rewritten to accomodate cyclists**.  By the same token, there should be different laws for other types of vehicles that are also significantly different from your typical passenger car: 18 wheel trucks, buses, horse drawn carriages, etc.  There are some laws that differ for different vehicles (special licensing requirements, certain road prohibitions, etc.), but in most cases, special laws are not written for bicycles."
heartjuice,fatpeoplestories,1391020780.0,"&gt;because otherwise I wouldn't get any dates

Uh... why is it not a thing for fat people to seek other fat people to date? Does she just expect to go out on dates with people more attractive than her (in this scenario skinnier equals more attractive) and have them be okay with that? Also, why are these fat women who say ""men like women with real curves"" never countered with ""but you don't like curvy (fat) men..."" It's just a ridiculous sense of entitlement. That they deserve their own hot man because they think everyone else (skinny women) get them. It's so ridiculous. I know that if I want to date a really attractive and skinny man, I'd probably have to lose a bit of weight.

I mean, it should be general common knowledge that a person is going to date someone else that is about their same rate of attractiveness. Of course there are outliers, especially for differences like someone has a lot of money (rich old men dating models) or someone is a chubby chaser (personal fetish). But for the most part, people all end up with people close to their same level of attractiveness or weight. And if they want to date someone outside of their level, they need to change their own appearance (lose weight, get more fit, or plastic surgery or something)."

When I first got with my partner his Nmom came across like a victim. It took me a long time to realize she loves being one. She loves being able to blame everything on Nhusband, loves using her predicaments as an excuse to get what she wants, and loves holding her ""sacrifices"" over being she has ""helped."" She will even intentionally set herself up to be a victim. She enabled her husband to be an N and her enabled her to be a bigger enabler and victim, thus the cycle continues. I finally recognized her as an N and even once called her on it. She was flabbergasted and has never again tried to pull her stunts on me (even avoided me for a bit), though she does occasionally try them on my partner, like I'm not going to figure it out. But I digress.

I say just keep talking to him. But you can't let it get to you. It is his life and his choice. Just what ever happens, do not put yourself in danger. I understand wanting to help someone you love and care for. But you can not become his caretaker or even start enabling him. He may be this way around you because he enjoys the attention you are giving him. If what you say is true and he feels like he needs to be punished yet craves love he is getting it. Your Nmom punishes him, and you love and care for him. What I can't help you with is finding the line between support and enable. I hope I have helped. Good luck!"

You need to look at how systems can be manipulated for the worse. And anarcho capitalism creates so many bad possibilities it's not worth giving a second thought to.

No, really. It's not. Snow is a pain in the ass. You have to shovel it. It makes older people hurt all over. You can literally die going outside. You have to buy a shit-ton of clothes, and they're expensive. Roads are treacherous. The constant cycle of thaw-and-frost requires millions of dollars of infrastructure upkeep. And that's not to mention all the pipes bursting in the winter, and bad floods that happen in the spring and summer.

We don't get any of that bullshit here. Just insane heat and the occasional apocalyptic-looking dust storm. If you have A/C in your car and home -- and pretty much everyone who isn't poor as shit does -- summer is just something you tolerate like anything else.

cracksocks,AskReddit,1391021127.0,"Obviously becoming a citizen is *much* more than just gaining the right to vote. We want people to demonstrate a commitment before giving them access to the privileges of citizenship. We want to know that they care somewhat about living here, about integrating into the culture, about becoming a productive member of society and not just economic dead weight, mooching off of services. It's a practical thing and it's erroneous to equate it with placing a barrier on suffrage for people who have it presently.

Your problem is that you don't have an objective definition of ""ignorant."" That's why you can't establish a perfect meritocracy, which in theory would be awesome but in practice is totally unworkable. Whatever your standard is, some people will slip through the cracks. I recommend you read ""The Mismeasure of Man"" by Stephen Jay Gould-- it's a great book on how people have seized power by limiting people's rights based on some arbitrary rule. Okay, maybe you think some policies are ignorant, but that's just your totally subjective opinion. You may have a totally different background and belief system than plenty of other people, and our living in a democracy means that they should have the right to express their ideas and morals through their vote. Societal good is not the good that *you* want, it's the good that *society* wants. We've tried a million other systems and every single one ends up discriminating against one group for the benefit of another. The reason why we allow everybody to have a say is so that a minority doesn't hijack all the power for their own benefit, which is the inevitable result of officially implementing this kind of social stratification. 

I am not a supporter of disenfranchising felons, actually, so your point is moot. As for the other two groups: obviously children are very impressionable, easily taken advantage of, and not well informed enough to vote. Age is a good standard to go by, because we know for a fact that all children share certain traits that would make it irresponsible to allow them to vote. We know that they're ineligible and they're easy to identify and keep track of. Illegal aliens should not be allowed to vote because they have not ""signed"" the social contract that our government is a part of. They do not necessarily have any obligations to our country and have not surrendered all of the privileges (not being taxed, for one) that citizenship requires that we give up. My problem with your proposal is that there is no such easy way of determining which adults should be allowed to vote and which should not. "

I have seen this several times, although I only saw the one surgery for it. They did a thoracotomy in order to remove the abscess and debride the necrotic lung tissue.

He had third spaced absolutely all over because he was in septic shock (causes leaky capillaries due to widespread inflammation) and they had been pumping him with litres upon litres of crystalloid in the ICU to keep his pressure from tanking. Of course, as you know with septic patients, all the fluid you keep pumping into them just ends up in their interstitial space anyway. Partly due to the leaky capillaries, but also partly due to low albumin (and thus low oncotic pressure) from the septic shock (the cellular machinery is busy making acute phase reactants instead of albumin), malnutrition, and malfunctioning liver (multi organ failure from septic shock). Of course, the other thing that happens when you keep pumping them with fluids is that they develop pulmonary edema (from the third spacing), which is the last thing you want on top of a severe necrotizing pneumonia. So it becomes an impossible balancing act between giving them enough fluids to keep their pressure high enough for adequate tissue perfusion, but not so much fluid that they go into flash pulmonary edema, their O2 sats tank, and they end up on the ventilator. What typically happens at this point anyway is that you have an unstoppable cascade of inflammation-poor perfusion-hypoxia, the lactate starts climbing and well then the rest is inevitable and you start to prepare the family.

Oh, all the nights I've spent on call, watching the lactate climb and playing the bolus-bolus-bolus-oh *shit* too far, break out the non rebreather, raise the head of the bed and push 80 of lasix stat game, because I'll be damned if I'm letting this patient die before handover in the morning.

&gt;Everyone can currently make up his own language, but despite this chaos, we're somehow able to communicate. A language is useless if no one else speaks it, just like a legal system is useless if no one else accepts it.

Yes, because of standardization. As it is, a lot of people want english to be the official language of the US.

Plus, he refuses to fight. He's like every swordsman in that he has an ego, so how he *privately* appraises his odds could be much less favourable than the impression he gives Tyrion.

MightySasquatch,minnesotavikings,1391021390.0,"That's a good question, and I had to consider it for a while. I think it's a combination of things. I don't know how much the Guthrie and the Walker get, so I don't want to comment on whether or not they're a ripoff or not. But I don't think the question is whether or not it's something people enjoy. The arts get funding because they are perceived (whether it's true or not) that they bring a value beyond just entertainment. Public parks fall under a similar reason, they have more value than just entertainment. 

I also think that something can have good effects and still be a ripoff. Like maybe you needed a new car but paid $2000 more than you had to. It doesn't mean that the car is horrible and had no reason to be purchased, it just means that you got ripped off.

As stated by another user, it's not like the NFL is starved for profits. In fact they are doing better than ever, and viewership seems to go up 20% a year. If every NFL team had to pay for the entirety of their own stadiums, the NFL would still survive, probably player pay would go down a little bit and the stadiums would be more like $500 million rather than $1 billion dollars. So it's not paying to have a stadium, it's paying to have more profits for the owners, a nicer stadium, and higher player pay, which is not something IMO that public money really needs to pay for.

The reason the NFL gets these kinds of subsidies is because cities compete with each other for prestige reasons and because people love watching NFL games. And don't get me wrong, I was really happy they came to a deal with the Vikings, I didn't want them going to LA (not that they would have, anyway), but I recognize that the deal doesn't make much economic sense for the state.

FWIW I think similar arguments apply to all sorts of special funding. The Mall of America somehow got $200 million in tax breaks last year. Many corporate headquarters get special tax breaks, or use of eminent domain. This selective funding always favors the large and powerful and prevents competition, which I think is bad in our economic system."

Your body uses urination for the removal of ammonium, other animals remove this compound in various ways depending on the size of the animal and their ability to store waste products. Smaller animals can't carry around the water associated with having a bladder full of urine so they excrete small ammonium rich pellets which are much higher in toxicity than our urine. 

The body also gets rid of any excess nutrients and indeed excess water through urination, the only way you can change the color of your urine is to have a higher water content as compared to the concentration of urea(the human compound containing ammonium), the way to get more water in your urine is to take in more water that you don't need so your body is forced to give it off as waste. To get it clear the concentration of urea has to be very small as aqueous urea is yellow, you will have to be giving off much more water than you needed to expel that waste. Meanwhile there are all kinds of health problems associated with over hydration that no one ever talks about. "

littlestray,AskWomen,1391021469.0,"When dreaming, your mind goes through information, explores it (and unfounded anxieties) and even uses figures you are familiar with as symbols to describe other figures. For example, your childhood best friend's mom can be representative of maternity in general, so you can have a dream about your childhood best friend's mom that isn't expressing anything about her as an individual but rather the archetype she embodies.

Trying to read your dreams literally is often an exercise in futility. If any of it speaks to you as something that strikes true, feel free to explore that, but don't fuss too much if your dreams don't seem to make sense. They aren't supposed to, not in a direct way. Dream logic simply draws from a different language than you'd utilize in waking life.

ironic_mustache_ride,chicago,1391021469.0,"I'm been on reddit for about a year, and my impression is that the community values information, discussion, debates and such. But the method by which we tally the value of posts does not accurately reflect what we would like to see on reddit. So yes, skyline pictures, silly memes and such will get more upvotes, I think it's just the nature of things when we can't find a way to quantify what makes an informative post. It takes someone actually digging into each post and using the upvote for more than an agree/disagree button to have the truly interesting posts come up in ranks, and this doesn't even take into consideration that some people come here simply to downvote everything to oblivion. 

Reddit is a *community* where it's not just the job of the mods to make this place good. Because we all have our own reasons for being here, all have our own idea of what a good post vs a shit post...we all have the responsibility to make reddit what we want to see. And also to accept that reddit is not your own personal website. So if you don't like skyline posts it is your responsibility to either ignore, downvote, or hide it. I think it's kinda silly that people bitch because they see posts on reddit that they personally don't like to see. Well...don't click on it. Move on. 

Unfortunately the only way to combat the downvote nazis here is to upvote everything. I do that sometimes. But honestly it's annoying to click  all over the page all day. Can the downvote nazis fuck off already?"

How about you pay attention to the words that I said. I said that anyone guilty of DWI has the exact same intent as someone that committed Intoxication Manslaughter. Yes, I would absolutely have them punished the same because the things that determined whether it was a simple DWI or Intox Manslaughter were dumb luck and completely out of their control. They had the exact same intent (or reckless disregard for the safety of others).

You are ignoring the words I am writing. They are being punished for having bad intent (including the bad intent of doing something reckless that could kill someone). Whole demographics do not have demonstrably bad intent. People that simply take drugs or drink alcohol do not have that bad intent.

You keep shoving that word ""might"" into my mouth. It is not about ""might."" It is about someone doing something flagrantly dangerous and the government stopping them from doing said dangerous thing. I someone with firing a gun into the air in a crowded area, do you wait till someone gets killed or do you just take the damned gun away from them? The correct answer is obvious.

This was really a study about shrinking.  Not a study about being short.  For all we know, many of these women were already tall or of average height.  And then their paranoia increased when they were put in a virtual reality environment and their height was shrunk without their knowledge.  Plus, they already had paranoid personalities going into the study.

The_British_One,AskUK,1391021638.0,"For secondary schools I'd look at GCSE &amp; A level grades (% A*/A, and % A*-C). Depending on where you are I'd certainly recommend applying to local grammar schools if there are any. 

For primary school it's more about literacy &amp; numeracy rates.

As others have said, go and visit the schools too. But don't be fooled. They will only show you well behaved classes (if any) and the nice facilities. For example, my old school recently had a ~£40million rebuild. It looks amazing and has great facilities now, but it's still not a brilliant school. It's good, but there are better ones in the area. So don't be fooled by facilities either. 

Edit: I noticed in another post here you're in Kent. There will more than likely be grammar schools near you and I know that for a lot of Kent you can just get a train to the best ones. I highly highly highly recommend them for when your kids are 11. Please, for their benefit, apply to them. I'm just finishing my schooling at a grammar school and wish I had gone there for the whole of my secondary education. It's not for everyone admittedly, but those it's not for won't get in. If your kids get in, they will get a great education and are far more likely to get top grades and into top universities. Not sure where in Kent you are exactly but there's definitely a lot I could name off the top of my head. The league tables would tell you the best ones, they're in the North West of Kent, but all grammar schools are good."

We conducted 144 household interviews to identify local herders’ attitudes and behavior toward snow leopards and other wildlife. **Most local herders claimed that they did not kill wildlife, and 42% said they did not kill wildlife because it was a sin in Buddhism.** Our results indicate monasteries play an important role in snow leopard conservation.

We actually spent the most time on the Peace and Reconciliation Hearings in South Africa. Because it was the most unique out of how all genocides were handled.

But the reason the Holocaust is so often mentioned in the context of genocide is precisely that -- it was the first time anyone was internationally prosecuted for ""crimes against humanity."" It's a foundational thing. You can't begin to talk about the international prosecution and conception of genocide without talking about the Holocaust.

&gt;You can't treat everyone the same when were different on an evolutionary level.

I don't treat everyone the same but the way I treat them isn't based on their gender. I'm bisexual so I don't have any reason to treat men and women differently. My female best friend is way more party-going and less emotional than my male best friend. No one's denying that men and women are physically different, and sure, different genders are more *likely* to behave certain ways. But certain races are also more likely to behave certain ways, would you also advocate treating all black people like criminals since they're statistically more likely to be incarcerated?

&gt;[**Glock 19 Gen 4**](http://imgur.com/Vv21s5G)

&gt;I bought this late last year on the side of the road (yep) by a farmers market. Guy had fired it 50 times through a LoneWolf barrel, and sold me the gun and one magazine for $420. I know most people lie about the round count, but based on the bore, I'd believe him.

&gt;I ''carry'' it in my car. It lives in a [Blackhawk Sportster OWB holster](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007YJYAAG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) in my center console, with the 15rd mag and the 31rd in the door. When I'm at home, it goes in my nightstand with the 31rd mag.

&gt;My current ammo is less than ideal, as getting pistol ammo when you're under 21 is harder. 15+1 or 31+1 9mm 115gr Remington UMC JHP. I should pick up some real self defense ammo at some point I guess, since they tend to not ID me anyway.

&gt;[**Maverick 88**](http://imgur.com/N2NSTpz)

&gt;I bought this at Academy for $189+tax. It's a 12 gauge and has an 18.5"" barrel. The magazine holds 4 3"" shells or 5 2.75"" shells. Currently it's loaded with 5 2.75"" Winchester Super X 00 buck and another 6 on the side. It's leaning against my TV stand, with the chamber empty and the safety on. I guess I should have the chamber loaded, but I'm slightly concerned about it tipping over, since shotguns aren't drop safe(?). If I bring it with my in my car I usually load the magazine with 1 oz slugs."

hankinator,DotA2,1391021880.0,"Hey, I can offer some advice. Birds are decent, but you don't have to build them. You can build visage a different way. 

Go 1,2,2,3,+ for the skill set. Put off birds till last if you want its up to you. 

For items, to start get a sages mask and some tangos. Then work your way to a medallion. 

Once medallion try to get a kill in your lane, once you get the kill you get boots. 

Voidstone and platmail. It will give you good mana regen and some more armor. Get a robe also. With a robe and level 4 gravekeepers cloak you get around 77% magic resistance, which is a lot. Then with the medallion and PM you get some insane amount of armor. Its over 20 so you get a lot of reduced damage.

Late game you want to build a heart ASAP, then use the PM to get an AC. Lastly get an sheep stick and if you feel like you need an extra bird, get an ags.

With this build though, you simply don't die. You are insanely durable and your soul assumption just wrecks. 

Hope this helps! Its the guide I usually follow (I made it). "

However, I don't think that the state gets a portion of TV revenue. Who is that from, the NFL? And I don't think the taxes levied on team operations and merchandise taxes are different than for any other business (meaning we won't see much of an increase because of the stadium).

Also while I agree with the principle that people fly down solely for the Vikings. How many people are we talking about, less than 500? Unless we're hosting the Packers. I honestly am not sure, nor about how much they actually increase revenue in the city. But I don't think it comes close to recouping the cost."

nerdrowwilson1,AskMen,1391022010.0,"Story time!

When I was in high school there was this girl I was into, but she had a boyfriend. I was awkward and weird in high school anyway, so I would have never done anything about it anyway. I could tell she was into me as well, though.

Fast forward about a year after graduating. I run into her at a party at a friend's house. She is with her new boyfriend. We talk for a bit, and she is flirting with me. This friend had parties 2-3 times a week, so I had lots of opportunities to see her, and her boyfriend usually wasn't there.

Finally, huge going away party for one of our friends. Keg and all that. So I'm feeling pretty drunk pretty fast. Everyone is in the basement, but I go upstairs for a minute to get something and run into her. I sit on the couch with her and we talk. I pull the old ""take something from her and put it in my opposite hand far away from her so she has to reach across my body to get it back"" move. She does it, straddles me, and we make out a bit.

Later in the night she says she wants more. I was still a virgin at this point, but by conscience made me say no, so long as she has a boyfriend.

Couple months go by, and I'm hanging out at the same friend's house drinking and watching a movie with a few other dudes. I get a text from her asking what I'm doing and if I wanted to hang out. I tell her what I'm doing. She responds with ""I broke up with (boyfriend's name) last week ;)."" So I did what any decent man would do...made an excuse to slip out, met her at my house, and fucked her.

Moral of the story? Don't assist in cheating. If she wants you, she will break up with her boyfriend."

ctesibius,motorcycles,1391022038.0,"Getting the wheel out and removing / replacing the tyre is quite easy on a 125 - /u/MisterShine is right on this. Repairing it is also easy if it is a tubed tyre. If it's tubeless, you'll need to get a tyre place to do it, but it should be cheap.

I hope you already have a manual, but if not, to get the rear tyre out you need to have the bike *securely* supported with the back wheel off the ground. If you have a centrestand, that will do the job. Unbolt the rear brake rod if it's a drum brake, remove the wheel spindle (a spacer will fall out - note which side it fitted),  derail the chain and pull the wheel out.

Now put the wheel down so that the rim is supported on one side, making sure that if there is a rear disc it doesn't touch the ground. Let the air completely out by removing the valve core (you need a small cheap tool for this, unless the top of your valve cap has two prongs to do the job).  Now tread the bead of the tyre down at the point the rim is supported. There's a ""well"" in the centre of the rim, and you're pushing to get the bead in to that well. This bit is easy on a 125, but it's why some people in this thread don't think that you can do it - it's much harder with the tyres for their larger bikes.

Get the bead down in to the well on both sides of the tyre, and keep it there as you work, because this is what gives you enough slack. Now use 12"" / 30cm tyre levers to get the bead on one side over the rim in small sections. Reach in and remove the inner tube, then patch it as for a bicycle. 

Putting it back together is basically the reverse. Put a little air in the inner before you push the bead back over as it helps to stop the inner getting pinched. You may also find that smearing a little mechanic's barrier cream (lanolin) on the bead will help to get it to seat more easily. As you inflate the tyre, the beads should pop in to grooves near the rim. Check that they are properly seated. If not, take the wheel to an air line, remove the valve core, and take the type up to about 50psi quickly, which should seat it. You might want to wear a helmet with the vizor down while doing this, but don't exceed the max pressure on the side of the tyre."

* aggravated assault

* robbery

* forcible rape

* murder

FuckingLoveArborDay,CFB,1391022058.0,"That's fair, actually.  I imagine he has Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska very close, but he has to give them a numbered rank.

For comparison the [/r/TheB1G Final Football Power Rankings](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheB1G/comments/1w4o7u/official_rtheb1g_final_football_power_rankings/) has the west teams: 3 Wisconsin (152), 4 Nebraska (201), 5 Iowa (226), 6 Minnesota (299).

So while Wisconsin/Iowa/Nebraska/Minnesota is probably less objectionably than Wisconsin/Iowa/Minnesota/Nebraska, what Bien has is in the ""acceptable"" range plus it has the added bonus of trolling Nebraska fans for pageviews.

Malgayne,whowouldwin,1391022082.0,"I think the D&amp;D comparison doesn't actually help us here, in part because D&amp;D is maybe the least realistic combat simulator on earth, and in part because Bronn isn't a rogue.

Bronn is an unscrupulous man, but he's a mercenary, not an assassin. If you put a Faceless Man in a battle to the death with Jorah Mormont in an enclosed arena, I give that to Jorah easily, because Faceless Men don't fight in enclosed arenas--it negates all their advantages. Bronn is a PROFESSIONAL fighter. That's what sellswords do--they're people who are so good at fighting that they do it to pay the bills, because the risk of dying in battle is so small that they can take that risk just for money.

Jorah has been trained, I get it. But aside from the fact that training doesn't make you as good a swordsman as Jon (it didn't make Robb as good a swordsman as Jon, and they had the same trainer), it also doesn't count for much without battle experience--which Bronn has in spades. My (unsupported) estimation is that Bronn has been in more battles than Jorah--after all, Jorah, been in exile for years, letting his skills go to rust."

Yes, the insult is directed at their *state of being*, which is not a matter of choice for many of them, unlike ""slut shaming"" which is direct insult to their choices and behaviour. We all understand that distinction already, and I mentioned that explicitly in my OP post.

However, the indirect effect is that makes a lot of men believe they need to change that *state of being*... by changing their choices and behaviour. 

Besides that, the presumption of virginity is usually based on a man's choices or behaviour. 

Examples: 

""He chose to be a brony? He must be a *virgin*."" 

""Look at how awkward he is around women. What a virgin.""

People think water is harmless and I've even had arguments over whether ""too much"" water could kill you or not. Obviously talking about drinking it and not drowning in it. The thing is, it's too much, the definition of ""too much"" is that it's more than what you should have. 

So the question comes back to: ""is having your piss clear too much water"" and I think you draw your own line on that one. What I can tell you is the body is happiest in the mediums and you don't need to force yourself to guzzle 2 liters of water a day or whatever it takes, to get your pee down to a specific shade.

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1391022377.0,"In my experience it would come down to personality.  
My feeling on attractiveness and the 1-10 scale is that physical appearance is only part of the final number.  
Unless I thought you wanted to try and hurt me, I don't think I'd feel intimidated.  Intimidation is an attitude or threat.  Any woman could slip into the kitchen and stab a man sleeping in the bed and I've met women that after few conversations I wondered would they do that... so I didn't go past conversation with them.  

Back to your question, as a man who is not in great shape and one who isn't specifically turned on by big muscles but not turned off either, I would put you in a category that will surprise you.  
I did an image search for Cindy Phillips and found a woman who is bulked up with solid muscles.  From a beauty standpoint, for me, that's the same as a voluptuous girl, overweight but with some good curves.  Both are attractive but not perfect.  I should add that underweight isn't hot either.  
If a woman was ripped, I'm talking veins and muscle strands popping out, that is in the same boat as grossly over weight.  Or grossly underweight for that matter.

I like a woman who is about a size 10, could be 12, could be 8.  
Now a woman who doesn't fit in that range, does she have a face I find attractive?  
Is she fun to hang out with?  

Face: 1-10  
Body: 1-10  
Personality: 1-10  
Intelligence: 1-10  
Other:  1-10  
**Overall**: 1-10  

So if I met a woman like this:  
Face: 8  
Body: 5  
Personality: 8  
Intelligence: 7  
Other:  7  
**Overall:**  9

Change Personality to 5 and the same woman just became a 4 overall.  

Now if were just talking Would I take you home from the bar for a night of fun, it becomes a yes/no and each number simply has a minimum, if you are over the (very low) bar, the answer is yes.  
Face: 4  
Body: 3  
Personality: 4  
Intelligence: 2  
Other:  2  
Overall I'd rate this one a 2-3, but 3+ drinks and I'm game for a night...  

TLDR:  I have high standards for a relationship, and no standards for a night.   

Edit: Better TLDR:  What matters is the whole woman, not just her body or any one part."

My calculation for 2 adults and 2 children shows your income and family size at 212% of Federal Poverty Level, the basis for the determination along with family size.

At level of income, on a Silver Level plan you could expect the rough split of costs to average around 73/27%, meaning your ins. company would pay the larger share of costs.

Your tax credit could fall between 4,900 and 6,500 dollars per year depending on you and your spouse's age, which would cover about 55-65% of your current insurance premium annually.

Ralkir,changemyview,1391022470.0,"&gt;The problem is that with financial abandonment, you would be taking away any and all consequences of sex from men and giving them all to women.

No, you are not giving anything to the woman, just we haven't found a way to remove the woman's consequences yet. Besides this is a shit argument anyway.

Here is your argument broken down. We have abortion. A woman chooses her consequence. She either gets it and doesn't have to go through pregnancy (simplified for the sake of argument) and does not have a child, as well as going through an abortion procedure, and whatever possible emotions arise. Or she doesn't and goes through pregnancy and has a child. 

Then we have the man and abortion and he has no choice. She either has a child or doesn't and he either supports her or doesn't during this time. And the man experiences whatever possible emotions arise from either situation. 

Then we have some sort financial backing out for the man. His consequences are backing out, losing access to the child but not having to pay any money in child support. Or he chooses not to opt out and supports the child. The women's consequences in this scenario are the same as a woman's for abortion.

And then we have your argument. Your argument is that in the man's option, you perceive the man to get the best deal. So you say, well this isn't fair, the man gets the best deal and we can't have that. So instead you change it so that the man's options are always the worse deal, he has no option to choose whatsoever. 

So in conclusion, this line of argument that you have is this, If we have financial abortion (or w/e term you want) the man get's a better deal than the woman, because of biological factors that are beyond current human control. As such, we need to legislate (put in artificial factors that **are** within our control), and make men's situation worse because biologically women have it worse.

DO you see your argument. **Biology isn't fair therefore we have to make it not fair for men too.** That is what you currently arguing for. And that is a shitty argument.

The_British_One,AskUK,1391022470.0,"At my primary school we played football in the playground (there were 3 separate playgrounds for the different age groups though) and then they blew a whistle/rung a bell and we lined up. The whole time parents generally stood around talking to each other.

I think 1 aspect is the legality. As someone else said, depending on the borough you may be legally responsible for your child until the teachers come and collect them, so the teachers will want you to stay there to keep your children safe.

A second thing, from what I've learned from my mum, is that it's almost a small social thing for the parents. They can have a few minutes to chat and catch up with each other.

And again as others have said, the security isn't just to keep psychos out, it's to keep the kids in. I know I certainly thought about climbing over the gates and going home a few times, and if the gates were open I may have just walked out (especially with encouragement from friends).

I don't begrudge them their success, like a lot of people. I actually like that they've become big in the states, so they can afford to do huge arena tours. I've been to five of their concerts, and the best are always the bigger ones -- light shows, lasers, elaborate stage sets, huge panels of flashing televisions, UFOs descending from the ceiling... that sort of thing. I like the spectacle.

I don't think they're the most unique or indie of what I listen to, but who cares? They're probably the only thing I've liked since the early-'00s that I don't hate from overplaying now. Belamy's guitar solos and falsetto still give me chills, and I love the atmospheric vibe of all the space and dystopian literature references.

I actually like some of the self-indulgent wankery they've become more prone to, like the 3-part rock operatic pieces on their last two albums. I feel like each album sounds different than the last.

&gt;I highly doubt the history of Taekwondo varies. Perhaps no one is entirely sure where TKD first originated; those stories may vary, yes. But where WTF and ITF comes from and their differences do not vary.

I don't know if the history of Tae Kwon Do varies, but what DOES vary are individual schools'/branches' interpretations of it...I don't think having a historical component to the subreddit is a bad idea, but there would have to be some seriously unbiased, fair-minded regulation going on.  The question is, is there someone among us willing to take on such a Herculean task?  I know that I'M not up for it.

&gt;I'm also fairly certain techniques and there names do not vary. A front kick is a front kick; never have I seen its form or name differ anywhere. I have, however, seen the names for some of the less-common, more advance techniques vary, but never the form. 

If you're just talking about names of techniques, that is one thing, but studying techniques obviously goes a lot deeper than a diagram or a photo of someone doing a form.  Even something as simple as a front kick can be complicated; is it a heel kick, a toe kick, or a ball kick?  Does the form specify a target?  What moves precede and proceed it?  Will those moves affect the way it is performed?  What is its combat application?  Is it being used offensively or defensively?  This is the sort of thing that most books won't tell you...

Basically, I don't disagree with what you're saying, but what you're suggesting would be a huge undertaking, and it makes me a little nervous, because Tae Kwon Do has such a strong reputation for ego and petty politics.  I feel like this subreddit really rises above that; you have people from many different backgrounds helping each other out and contributing...I wouldn't want it to be divided while people split hairs about the types of details we were discussing above...I'm not saying that I'm right, but that is just how I feel about it."

Malgayne,whowouldwin,1391022510.0,"I'm not sure that Jorah is stronger or fitter than Vardis. Vardis was a captain of guards, Jorah was a lord's heir. He went to battle, to be sure, but he had to divide his time between battle training and a number of other things--and while Jorah is younger in the books, in the show they seem roughly the same age.

Bronn becomes a wealthy knight in the second book, thanks to Tyrion. He has no shortage of funds with which to commission his own armor if he so chooses. If he fights without it, it's because he fights BETTER without it. Meanwhile, in Jorah's only battle with a faster, unarmored man, he gets wounded, and his armor saves him--and that was with an opponent who DIDN'T have experience fighting armored men. Bronn is smart enough not to make that mistake.

I've done European longsword fencing myself, and one of the first things they teach is that you block EVERYTHING. If you rely on your armor to protect you from a strike, you're dead. Armor is an insurance policy to save you if your sword ever slips. You can't count on it, and catching a blow on your armor is a sign that the fencer made a mistake. Agains Bronn, that mistake would have killed Jorah."

&gt;NO undo/unselect button if you misclick fuel tank instead of i.e. strut. So careful with left clicking

Undo still works, but fuel conduits will not be restored correctly when they are from a part you didn't restore.  That's worded terribly, but here's an example.  You disconnect a side-mounted booster from the core rocket by mistake, and the core rocket was connected to the booster with a fuel duct.  You can use undo to restore the booster to the construction, but the fuel duct from core to booster will have dropped and must be re-done.  

Ducts and struts, once attached to the construction (either as part of a branch you're re-attaching, or as a new part), basically remember where you placed the first piece, and the angle at which you attach the other end. In other words, the construction only stores the position and angle of one end of the strut; the other end goes to whatever's in the way at that angle.  If there's nothing there (or an unattachable part, like the AR202 (MechJeb)), the strut/duct goes nowhere."
i_prefer_minecraft,changemyview,1391022584.0,"&gt; Part of your argument rests on the assumption that by eliminating potentialy unhealthy foetuses we somehow lose some potential people and their contributions. However what is more likely to happen is that the parents will just try again and this time have a healthy kid. No loss of anything at all.

What about people who are older, or who have fertility issues? They may well lose their chance at a child, or at the number of children they want. Especially because birth defects are more common when the mother is older, which is also when women are less fertile. If the difference is between a disabled child or no child, is it really worth denying someone a chance at parenthood?

That's the problem with all cross sectional studies in developmental psychology. Sure, they should be taken with a grain of salt and longitudinal studies are better, but they're not entirely invalid.

&gt; In any case, the idea that we ""search through memory"" is problematic. We have no evidence such a thing is done by our brain.

The brain does exhibit behaviours that can be explained as if it's searching through memory. Like what's shown in this study. That's probably not how the brain *actually* does it, but if the underlying mechanism consistently produce the same apparent pattern, there's still use for the model."

additionally, empathy, as i typically use the term and meant it above, isn't just about putting yourself in another's shoes, it is about imagining the experience of being another person.  of course ""accurate empathy"" is impossible; we cannot know first hand exactly what it is like to be another person, but to engage in empathy genuinely and to find dissonance between ideas is impossible.  empathizing isn't about stepping into a person's situation and analyzing the best course of action they could have taken.  empathizing is about considering it a given that the course of action a person took seemed like the best at the time.  it is about accepting the validity of another's every choice and allowing oneself to feel as they would; there cannot be evaluation or judgment of emotion as wrong."

EDIT: Additional info: Kobe averaged 28.3-6.3-5.4 when CP3 averaged 21.1-11.6-4.0. Their TS% was the same. Kobe had a lower TO%, Steal%, Assist% (obviously), ATR and higher Rbd%, Block%, Usage. CP3 also had a higher WS/48 and PER.

mmp31,politics,1391022778.0,"Minimum wage only temporarily raises the payrate of minimum wage workers. There's a reason that, say, engineers make X amount of times the amount of money that minimum wage workers make. It's because that's what the market has determined their labor is worth relative to each other, using our pricing structure to describe the labor values in absolute terms. The same goes for any job relative to another.

No amount of raising the minimum wage is EVER going to change the real relative labor values. What it does do, however, is distort the pricing structure that describes those labor values in absolute terms, until it (somewhat) recovers from government abuse. Eventually the wages of higher earners will go up and minimum wage earners will be making the same amount of money compared to the higher income groups as they were before.

The real problem is inflation. Since the minimum wage increase in 2009, prices have gone up 9%, which means that the poor have seen a decrease in their income of 9%. For people who can barely feed themselves, that is SIGNIFICANT. It also contributes to the wealth gap problem because inflation is essentially a hidden flat tax on all dollars, and flat taxes disproportionatley harm the poor.

Locking minimum wage to inflation is a non-solution, because it will not change the fact that the poor's wages will be devalued until minimum wage goes up again. We should demand that the government immediately abolish inflation, which is controlled entirely by the Federal Reserve. Then we won't have to worry about rising prices disproportionately harming the poor."

I'm not fine with how it was launched.  I'm not personally affected, so I'm not really outraged, but I do think they made a huge mistake.

There's no reason they couldn't have waited a week or two to push the feature live, and made a post in advance, letting people know.

The argument ""it was all public information anyway"" is flawed.  Yes, it was public, but it wasn't trivially easy to find and it is now far easier for trolls etc to discover.  The barrier to entry, however low, was real - it drastically reduced the number of people seeking out and/or finding that info.  Yes, some people still sought/found it, but you get my point...

I'm not even necessarily in support of being able to hide certain subs from displaying on the user page. I don't care because I've got nothing to hide.  I just think the way the feature was launched and announced with zero notice was done without proper care/concern for those who might have something they don't want found that easily.

**A fake but realistic example:**

Say someone who doesn't even actually perform self harm mods a sub about self harm.

Maybe that person:

1) didn't know stattit existed. or maybe they do but feel it's a small enough quantity of people seeing it that the exposure isn't really a big deal.

2) rarely posts in the sub and only really performs moderator actions in it.

Now, you view their user page and the first thing you see is they're a mod of a sub about self harm.

What impression does that give *the average person*?  Not a seasoned redditor who knows that people mod all sorts of stuff they're not personally interested in - but *the average person*.

Users like this should've been given a week or so to create an alt if they wanted, etc.

Also, creating and modding an alt now puts that alt at the bottom of the moderator list - something that may be a negative effect.


Yes, you can say ""the info was public all along anyhow"" - but most people had NO clue stattit existed, or figured the exposure was low because very few people (relative to reddit's base of readers) probably visit stattit and search out info like that.

A reaction of ""I had no idea people could even find that info at all, or didn't think many would seek it out, and now Reddit has made it front and center"" shouldn't be surprising."

It is not like an RTS at all, no. It is an RPG where your ""avatar"" is a pilot suspended in a capsule inside the ship. The capsule simulates sound and other things so capsuleers don't lose their minds in space. The capsule allows total control over the ship.

The way it plays is very much a point-and-click RPG with lots of spreadsheets. You have what is called an ""overview"" which is sort of a 2D spreadsheet of the 3D world around you which allows you a quick reference of the battlefield and can be sorted by range, ship type, player name, corporation/alliance, and size. Likewise, you can always look around you and see the same information in 3D. So you can click the overview for a stargate, right-click it and warp to it. Or you can look around, find the stargate, right-click it and warp to it. You can also double-click in space to manuever.

A lesser travesty is that he was robbed of his athleticism because of injury.  There's no reason he couldn't have had 5-6 more 20-10-4 seasons after 2003 if he didn't hurt his knee.  

My point is, Webber was as or more talented than Dirk or Garnett.  Things outside of his control (poor officiating and injuries) robbed him of the legacy his talent deserved.  Compare Webber's 5 year peak against either of those two guys, and Webber comes out on top... both in stats and accolades.

&gt;I think there are two ways of looking at this question. One way is to ask what science fictional books can someone just pick up and read, and the answer turns out to be any number of them, particularly if they're labeled as being outside the genre. YA is full of science fiction novels, most notably right now of course is the The Hunger Games, **but you also see plenty of people easily picking up the latest Margaret Atwood or reading Cormac McCarthy's The Road**. 

So I'm not seeing where anyone considered Hunger Games to be a suggestion for the topic. I thought maybe you just skimmed the pictures in the article but Hunger Games isn't pictured. "

That wasn't our discussion, We were talking about our society celebrating these predators and acting as though nothing happened and even praising them. 

Our current prison system is punitive not rehabilitative so not much to do with that until there is some reform. 

If we want to prevent then sexual education needs to start around 8y/o (age appropriate) and coupled with social navigation (age appropriate a well) and later moving into sexual navigation. All of this needs to continue on up through high school. As it is currently kids are lucky to get some sex ed sprinkled in a couple of grades here and there and usually not until HS and there is no sexual navigation until college for most and of course most kids don't go to college so what of them?

It gets better...first you have those nagging injuries that just don't heal like they used to. Then you find it more of a struggle just to stay in shape, much less get in shape. Then you realize just how much of your life has already gone by. All that damned wasted time (cue the Eagles). Then you get that panic attack that says ""Holy SHIT it's ALL downhill from here!"" But that panic attack is wrong.

&gt;I just feel that so many experiments failed and I had so many false starts

Then you realize that you *know* shit. Those failures **are** experience. They don't give you experience, they **are** experience, and it gives you a degree of wisdom. You may not be able to do all the things you used to, but that experience allows you to do other things that you never could before. You realize your patience becomes legion. The wisdom allows you to see things that you never saw before. You can wait anything out because you can see where things are heading. You know what *not* to wait out because you know where it's heading. You know how to adjust things to head in a different direction, alter outcomes. Not just the midlife crisis thing, but lots of things....business, relationships, money, hobbies, everything...because you've been there before. 

And that opens you up. You can do new things, you can apply seemingly unrelated experience to new situations. You can figure things out based on what has happened before. And you move on. And then you can get back to your life.

It gets better man, promise. Remember when you were 15 and life sucked because FUCK, man, 15 sucks? Same kind of thing. Life is a series of phases, and this is yet another.

It wasn't until *hours* later that most cities and counties declared roads closed. Four thousand school children were stranded across the state.

&gt;I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick.

I'm sorry - you're being a dick.

&gt;The issue isn't the snow, per se

It isn't snow at all. Or people. It's ice. Ice is a completely different beast than snow when you're talking driving conditions. Businesses closed - not all places allowed employees/customers to stay overnight - and people had to leave. Sucks all around."

kinkakinka,halifax,1391023084.0,"I am on the board of a dog rescue and this is an issue that exists when it comes to our adoption agreements. We haven't had any major issues, but one of the agreements in the contract is that if you are ever not able to care for the dog anymore you are supposed to return it to us so that we can find it another home. One of our adopters did not do that. We could send them a nasty-gram about it and cause problems, or we can just let it go. Really, the agreement is more there so that people are more inclined to reach out to us and think about the things they are doing rather than for us to be able to take them to court.

We also have surrender agreements that are usually more easily held up. If the owner signs their dog over to use then they can't then sue us to return their dog because they agreed to give it to us in the first place in writing. Another rescue group I know of actually had to deal with that a while back, they won, though.

--

&gt;Rates of premature birth, babies with low birth weight or small size, and preeclampsia—a potentially life-threatening condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure—were similar across the alcohol consumption categories.

--

&gt;How clear is the medical evidence supporting strict abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy? Not very strong. And recent studies suggest pregnant women who have an occasional drink don’t harm themselves or their baby. A 2012 Danish study, for example, found that low to moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy did not affect executive functioning among 5-year-olds.

noodlyjames,DebateReligion,1391023121.0,"This is ripped from [AIG](http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/cm/v3/n3/origin-of-human-races)

There are several significant factors which can be considered in attempting to account for the origin of the physical difference between races. The first of these is the origin of different languages; the second is the splitting into groups which this produced; and the third is the environment into which each of these groups moved.

After the flood, the Bible records that God commanded Noah and his family to multiply and cover the earth (Genesis 9:1, 18, 19). In Genesis 11:1 the Bible records the fact that man had decided to disobey God’s command to cover the earth. They had, instead, decided to establish a “massive urban complex” as a focal point. The Tower of Babel was built to ensure that worship and society were united around this common goal of staying together.

In Genesis 11:8 is recorded God’s judgment on this disobedience by His imposition of different languages on man. Previously, they had all spoken the one language. The purpose of this is spelled out in Genesis “so that man could not understand one another and therefore no longer be able to work together against God.” (Gen.11:5–7) They would be forced to spread out over the surface of the earth as God had commanded them. The efficiency of this judgment can be seen when you attempt to get groups of people of different nationalities to work together. How God imposed different languages is not stated, but since he had created Adam with inbuilt speech, it would be no major problem to reset the physical and nervous controls to produce another differing form of inbuilt speech. This new language would also have its own repertoire of words and the capacity to coin new words consistent with their language.

With this enforced separation, it is not too difficult to imagine how other minor physical differences such as skin variations already in existence, could begin to show."

1. Are you including your full physical address?
2. You should be tailoring your resume to each individual job, not just some blanket resume. You should also focus on accomplishments, rather than just duties. For example, where you promoted from ""Noob Tech"" to ""Tech"" at some point? Did you build a presentation and train people? Did you meet or exceed your performance metrics? Did you do something to make the job easier like compile a ""canned answer"" database or something like that?

You should also keep each bullet point to 1 line if possible. So  you might say:

SomeTechCo.     Tech Lackey    2012-2014 (you can put actual dates if you want)
Key Accomplishments:
* Implemented and designed knowledge base used by technicians.
* Documented and developed training material for company's ReallyGreat product line.
* Built and maintained company's ""Support"" website.

I know the Lakers were 26-13 and 30-17 that season before some injuries (Lamar) made the Lakers slump hard (they lost seven straight if I recall correctly). 

Had the Lakers finished 55-27 (~67% that they were at 26-13) with a supporting cast of Mr. Inconsistent (LO) + Luke, Kwame, Smush, etc., then there would be no doubt in my mind that Kobe would be MVP even beyond Dirk/Mavs' extraordinary regular season.

lordfuzzywig,technology,1391023596.0,"You can play EVE for free once you get well-established by farming ISK. So the subscription price is sort of negligible. The ISK-USD conversions are for the layman who doesn't play to understand the sheer magnitude of the losses. The ship that I flew around most in was about 50 USD converted.

Sub-capitals are sort of in their own category. It looks like the following, smallest/least powerful to largest/most-powerful, with nuances and specalizations (interceptors, SBs, logistics, T3s, T2s, etc.) that I don't want to bother getting into.

Frigate&lt;Destroyer&lt;Cruiser&lt;Battlecruiser&lt;Battleship

A Destroyer is a frigate-class ship that can ""snipe"" frigates easily. Imagine a less-mobile frigate that has like twice the guns but is slightly larger (and therefore slightly easier to hit). They also are capable of laying down the hurt on cruisers. They lock-on quickly and are exceptionally fast -- capable of 1km/s+ speeds.

Cruisers are your middle-ground. They're agile (600m/s speeds roughly), powerful, and have small enough weapons to track dessies and frigs, while still being able to tangle with battleships. Battlecruisers are slow cruisers that are more heavily-armoured and are basically ""Battleships Lite"".

Battleships are heavy, slow (300m/s sometimes if you're lucky), well-armoured ships that can sometimes have large drone bays which allow force multiplication. They have large weapons that have difficulty tracking anything smaller than a cruiser (hence drones), but if they hit a Frigate, it's almost guaranteed to pop.

A frigate -- or a group of frigates -- is perfectly capable of taking down a battleship. Likewise, a competent cruiser pilot can easily beat a Battleship. There are also missile boats, at every level, that don't have any ""tracking"" issues. But missiles scale. So a frigate can do devastating damage to another frigate, slightly less damage to cruisers (but almost 100% hit chance), and even less damage to battleships (but even closer to 100% chance to hit). The opposite is true from large missiles. Battleships use very large missiles that do devastating damage to battleships and battlecruisers, much less damage to cruisers with a decent chance to miss, and barely ANY damage to frigs with a large chance to miss.

The best example I can use is... Try shooting a quarter with a BB gun. Probably pretty easy, right? Now try hitting a dime with a .50 cal. That's about how the gunplay works in EVE. There are lots of maths involved with transversal velocities etc. A ship travelling directly toward or away from you will be more likely to be hit than one orbiting you. This is where manual manuevering comes into play.

Once you get into capital/flagships, things get hairier and much more logistics-based. Carriers have huge drone bays that pump out ""Fighters"" which are basically frigate-size drones that hurt very badly. Carriers generally are healers, and their offensive capabilities are limited. Dreadnoughts are POS-poppers and titan-destroyers. Imagine them as massive floating siege artillery that have to be immobile to shoot.

There are lots of little nuances -- ECM ships, drone ships, etc. But that's the gist of it.

My fiance and I were somewhat forced to get engaged and soon get married in order to be together. 

Unfortunately he is Canadian and I am an American/Brazilian. The original plan was for me to just move up with him in Canada whenever I finished school by getting work in my field (which is easy enough to find jobs of over there). Unfortunately the process turned out to be extremely complicated and it would be nearly impossible for me to immigrate through the working visa. After crying our eyes out and talking to many different people going through the same thing, as well as the immigration services, we jumped to the conclusion that the only way for us guarantee that we would be able to be together was by getting married.


This was decided around October or November 2013, and we announced it to everyone earlier this month (by changing our status on facebook). We will probably be getting married in June/July."

[This Russian article](http://www.utro.ru/articles/2004/11/30/380414.shtml) also uses it as a stock photo. Both articles are from after the book was published, so it's not unlikely that they got it from the book. 

You might consider emailing the photographers rather than the publisher: david@davidcturnley.com and contactpeterturnley@gmail.com. ~~It appears to be David rather than Peter, but it's difficult to tell because his website is under construction.~~ Some of the other pictures from the book are on Peter's website.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1391023941.0,"Hah! It's a scene from the Ramayana, isn't it?

One handy trick a lot of digital artists use to check their composition in Photoshop is to create a new layer on top of the stack, fill it with a grey (black or white works too) and set its blend mode to saturation. This allows you to see the painting only in values (lights and darks), removing all saturation and hue information. Doing so lets you double check your silhouettes and the depth of your painting.

I think if you were to use this technique, you'd notice that the figures in the foreground get lost, because their values are too light. You may also find that the mountains in the foreground are too dark. A rule of thumb that often helps is to have dark foreground elements and light background elements. This rule can be broken, but it's a good starting point.

Another trick for your next painting is to start it out working in greyscale with a very limited palette - perhaps just black, white and one middle grey. If you restrict yourself to this while blocking out your major forms, you will force yourself to make decisions regarding depth and composition. Then, once you lift that restriction, you will be able to adhere to those decisions as you add colour and detail.

AdamColligan,askscience,1391023994.0,"Under what conditions does an overcast night sky, reflecting urban light, provide better illumination than a clear night sky?

Another way of putting this might be: when was the first night, if it's happened yet, that an urban area was bathed in more light under an overcast sky than it would have had under the starry heavens?

Why ask? :

I grew up in the southeastern US, in a place that was suburban/exurban. When it was clear, especially further out from the city, it was starry. When it was cloudy, the sky was dark, and it was hard to see things around me at ground level .

Then I moved to the East of England. When it was clear, there was enough light pollution that you could not see very many stars. When it was cloudy, there was sometimes a faint glow about the sky, but it was still quite dark. If you looked down toward London, you could see more of a glow (if the cloud bottoms were high enough).

Now I live in the middle of a fairly large American city. The difference is very obvious: when it is overcast, especially a fairly low overcast, the whole sky seems to glow orange, and while it may be hard to tell because of streetlights, I think the reflected light is noticeable in terms of lux at ground level.

This has made me wonder (and maybe it only works for a small crescent or new moon?). How much light output does there have to be around me, and how close to me, before a typical cloud base reflects enough of it to compete with the rest of the universe in providing working illumination on the ground?

I think that he's disrespecting you by not making sure she stops being nasty to you/about you and your family, and also venting about fights to her, and I think that should be the focus of the conversation you should be having rather than telling him he can't talk to her because she's a girl."

Let me put it another way: I'm guessing you had a night this bad before your 76 days sober. I'm guessing you probably had many. What would your reaction have been then? Shrug it off, pretend it wasn't that bad, get mad at people for getting on your case, maybe pretend you would be more careful in the future? Some of the above, all of the above?

This time around you recognized that it was a serious fuck up, that you just can't drink, that you are in fact powerless over drink. In one bad night you recognized that. That's why I think you learned something valuable in those 76 days. You are 2 days *back*. Keep the lesson you learned close, keep learning from it.

Around here, you have a public option, and a few private companies.

&gt;These were once mainly private. These again, could easily be private just as Ambulances are private and no one thinks twice about it.

Yeah...last time I was in an ambulance it was $700 for a ride. Not sure privatization is all its cracked up to be.

&gt;There's a lot of private scientific research. The government tends to crowd out certain research and/or take money away from productive research and fund it for war making by DOD/DARPA.

There's a lot done in the public sector too. Like...this thing we're using to communicate right now. All due to space age defense research.

&gt;Which have created a culture of unemployable individuals and has failed to decrease the poverty rate.

News flash, people are on safety nets because they can't find jobs. Although I will say automatically losing all your benefits when you find work is also a problem that discourages work.

He also had an unfamiliar sword, a disadvantage that Jorah wouldn't have. Plus, Vardis did exactly what Bronn wanted him to do: chased him around in full plate and tired himself out. I don't see Jorah falling into this trap.

A note on Bronn squaring up to Sandor: did this happen in the book? Has Bronn even seen Sandor fight?

Just because Bronn can fight better without his armour doesn't mean he can fight better than an armoured knight. Bronn's never really trained in armour and would presumably get tired and slow if he tried to use it, that doesn't mean him fighting without armour is some kind of advantage. Bronn has to get around Jorah's parries *and* target a weak spot in his plate, wheras all Jorah has to do is land a solid hit. That's a big advantage for bearman.

I think the books portray Jorah as a decent knight, whereas the shows don't. And I think an unarmoured man has to be *much* better than somebody in full plate if he's going to win - in my opinion Bronn is probably faster but not so much so that he could win. He *could* do it, I just don't think so."

The biggest thing is this:  the game couldn't hold my attention when it was free for me to play.  It was free, I had nothing else to be doing, and still I turned it off because it didn't draw me in at all.  Why would I ever pay a premium price for something that wasn't enjoyable when it was free?"

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1391024362.0,"I should preface this by saying I agree that Game 6 was a travesty. There's just no way you can say that 25 free throws in a single quarter where the most marketable franchise / 2x champs are about to get eliminated wasn't the refs influencing the game. Some people will try to argue the point but I won't.

That said, I don't believe the series was rigged for the Lakers. I believe Stern wanted a 7-game series to maximize profits. Both the Lakers and the Kings would have smashed the Eastern team, so Stern realized the WCF was his biggest cash cow. If you look at Game 5, Kobe had 5 fouls and Shaq had 6. Shaq shot 14-18  and got one free throw attempt. The Lakers were outshot in free throws 33-23 despite having the most dominant player in the game on their team. The Lakers lost by one.

I sincerely believe Stern expected the Lakers to win Game 6 regardless, and so the refs favored the Kings in Game 5 so that the series would be extended to 7. But the refs probably knew that if it looked like the Lakers were going to lose (as it did in Game 6) they had to make them win, hence the travesty that was Game 6.

But what people never look at is that on the series, Kobe &amp; Shaq averaged 4 fouls / game, the most of any player not guarding the two out of three best players in the series (Christie and Divac respectively). Sacramento had more free throws total and a higher FT/FG rate, **even though the Lakers had Shaq on their team.** While I fully acknowledge that Game 6 was pretty much rigged to help the Lakers, I think we should also examine what led up to that game as well.

carbidegriffen,AskMen,1391024366.0,"Reading that brought tears to my eyes.  I read the first paragraph and I thought you might be my wife.  But as I read on I found that you are not my wife.  My heart goes out to you guys, the challenges that come with a special needs child can be very stressful, but it sounds like you are both being great parents.  

But about your husband and men in general.  This is a weird time for men.  Back in the day men went to work and women raised kids.  Then women decided that they would like to go to work too.  So they did, and they did it on their terms.  Now it's ok for a woman to be a mom or have a career or both, there are challenges in the both but lets set that aside for now.  
Men on the other hand are now trying to do the reverse, work and support the family and at the same time be good and engaged dads.  The big difference is that it's not necessarily on men's terms.  Society is putting pressure on men to do both and even though we weren't raised or taught how to do both, we feel the expectation to succeed at both.  

I'm not saying that we have it any harder than women nor that we need special treatment, but I think it's important that it is recognized that men at this time might not be as prepared or equipped to handle the challenges of being a parent and a ""bread winner""  

Let's be honest, being both is frick'n hard as my wife and I can attest.  

Something that might help your husband is the understanding that it's OK to feel the way he does.  Sometimes naming a problem is all that it takes to solve it.  
You might share this with him:  http://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeswomanfiles/2012/05/23/real-men-dont-need-work-life-balance/  

You could insist that he go out for beers with friends at least once a month.  Or as someone else suggested give him the house to himself for a day (or two).  I love it when I get the house to myself even for a few hours.  

Finally the obligatory /r/AskMen  solutions: you two should talk about it and give him blowjobs.

What troubles me most about it, though, is that she's making all of this about her. My interpretation, with many many liberties and jumped conclusions, is that she's being forced to confront her own issues because you're having teenage struggles that remind her of what she's worked hard to suppress. She's unable to confront her own issues (evidenced by her freakout that you're having issues at all AND her discomfort with sitting down with a therapist), so she's blowing your problems out of proportion to distract from her own. 

She may be trying to protect you, but in the most wildly unhealthy of ways. She's also trying very hard to keep you for herself, and I'd hate to see what she'll be like when you're ready to leave for college.

 I'd take a peek over at /r/raisedbynarcissists and see if what you find over there is relatable. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I hope that your therapist is able to help both of you. I mean, really, there's no shame in seeing a therapist, and really, it can be a huge relief to just have someone outside of your situation hear you out.

Never Let Me Go, while good, isn't at all scifi. It's set in modern times, with modern technology. Only it is a bit dystopian with the aspect of the main characters only real purpose to society is being used to harvest their organs (not spoilers). I can't comment on the others as I haven't read them (yet) but Never Let Me Go definitely isn't a book I'd turn to if I was craving a little scifi.

edit:

&gt;So Ender's Game — but borrow it from a library or get it from a used bookstore — and don't google Orson Scott Card once you're done.

This is so true. I've enjoyed a few of Orson Scott Card's books. Enough to make me want to read more. And I really do want to read more. I'm just trying not to let the other things I know about him stop me from enjoying his work in the future. I mean, as long as he doesn't put any of his bad messages in his work, it should be okay, right? I feel so conflicted about it. I think not buying the books directly is a great way to deal with this conflicted feeling."

However, I think thigh gaps are a ridiculous thing for most girls to try and achieve if it isn't their natural physique. I find it worrisome because it is yet another fitness fad pounded into our brains by media and girls are yet again convinced that if they don't look a certain way horrible things will happen in their lives. I have seen girls go to extremes such as starving themselves to wearing what amounts to girdles for their thighs to achieve this look.

Something girls and men alike need to understand is this, when you learn to accept, love, and appreciate the person *you* are, that is how you attract the right kind of people. 

Thigh gaps are yet another scary and potentially dangerous beauty trend and soon to be phased out and replaced by something else that is equally frightening by Big Sister Media.  "

dankenascend,AskReddit,1391024710.0,"1. Floor it! The friction from your tires spinning on the ice will melt the ice and give you better traction.

2. Get on your brakes **hard**. It takes longer to stop on ice, so stop harder.

3. Change lanes, unless there are ruts. If there are ruts, that means someone already made it going that way, so follow them! Otherwise, stay nimble and change lanes constantly until you find good traction.

4. Leave those winter clothes at home. You want to be as light and agile as possible, and those extra pounds make a difference.

5. Cruise control is your friend. Keeping your speed constant makes navigating the cold easier.

6. Get going as soon as you crank your car. Your engine is cold, and it wants to warm up as quickly as possible, so give it plenty of gas.

7. Follow closely, the heat from their car will linger briefly, and you will get better traction the closer you are to the car in front of you.

8. If snow or ice is caked on your radiator, GREAT! That thing is for keeping your engine cool, so all that ice is indication that it is doing a good job.

9. Pour **hot** water on your windshield if it has ice or snow on it to clear it. The hotter the water, the longer it will stay clear.

10. Keep your phone out and keep an eye on weather updates (twitter feeds are great for this). Always be informed, especially if you are in motion, because conditions can change quickly."

onthefence928,DebateReligion,1391024749.0,"floods are extremely common in regions of early civilization, it is not unusual that they each have flood stories.

flood plains provide many benefits to the earliest argraian societies, they are regular, thus good planning allows the civ to exploit them. they create rich soil for crops as nutrients and sediments flow downstream and deposit on the flood plains. they also provide transportation and a natural barrier for invading armies. thats why the eqyptians and Mesopotamians were so successful. same across the world.

if you look at the cultures that have flood myths, they almost all have a history of settlement on regions with regular flooding. 

edit: as for the world being flooded by melting ice caps, that is an extreme scenario only used by hollywood and story tellers. not considered possible by the scientific community, there is simply not enough water.

sharshenka,changemyview,1391024904.0,"In my opinion, it seems like you have a skewed view of the non-educational value of college, and of what opportunities are available to young people.

First, in college you take classes and earn a degree, etc, but you also learn how to manage your schedule, prioritize different tasks, things that you are going to be needed for most good paying jobs. College is a better place to learn this than managing your life and a menial job. Which seems more like a most office jobs: deciding whether to get easy work out of the way, study for a test, or do your reading for a class; or remembering to get up on time, flip burgers for 10 hours, then going home.

You also seem to be overestimating what a young person can do. You mention traveling Europe and visiting museums. But a lot of parents won't fund a Euro trip, but will fund college. Similarly, I've never heard of someone getting a loan for a trip (outside of using credit cards, which seems way worse than student loans).  Same thing with buying a coffee shop after a few years as a barrista. Even if I had the money, I wouldn't give it to my kid if that was their plan. What is the chance, really, that someone with a few years of serving experience will know how to run a business?

Okay, so say someone graduates from highschool, scrapes together first and last month's rent, and starts working to support themselves. This way they are learning to be on their own, as they would in college. They aren't likely to get a very relavent job to what they are going to want to do eventually, but you mention doing things like writing blogs. The thing is, most low wage jobs are exhausting. You would have to be really resourceful and motivated to get off work, then put the time in to gain relevant experience on your own. The motivated and resourceful are the ones that will make the most of college. If you are likely to party and deliver pizza in college, what do you think you are going to do if you aren't in school? 

Overall, it seems fine to say that college isn't for everybody, and should be taken seriously, but you seem to think it has NO value if you aren't getting a PHD, which does not seem accurate to me."

If you leave it in a station in player owned space, where mine is, if I come back and my corporation has lost access to that station, it's stuck there.  I can't get in to get it, but no one can take it.  I can put it up on contracts though, which are typically referred to as ""fire sales"" and are very common as the front moves in a territorial war.  For example, what happened in the fight yesterday was the losers lost control of their staging system, which means all their stuff they had there to reship during deployment is no longer accessible to them.  Which will be a major turning point in the war, which is why both sides committed so much to the fight.  However, they will be able to list things on the market if they are packaged, but unpacked and fit ships will have to go up on contract, and will likely be underpriced by at least 20%, which is the fire sale I mentioned.

So let me get this straight: you're defending a group that you don't think is right and you disagree with most of its members. 

-/r/trp constantly shames women for wanting to have sex when they praise men who do the exact same thing.

-Mods on that sub don't believe spousal rape exists.

-Many TRPers wish that women don't have the right to vote.

-Currently on the front page [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1wgfnq/i_keep_thinking_women_are_incapable_of_fairness/) is claiming that women are incapable of being fair

-The 8th most upvoted post of all time on that sub claims ""women have no loyalty beyond their own narcissism""

And you're willing to overlook *all of that* so you can be associated with a group that teaches important values like ""stand up for yourself"" (which btw is still the only positive thing you've said about that theredpill).

What we can see here is that yeah, D'Antoni's system inflates assist numbers. If you watch the Lakers this year that's self-evident. That said, he's doing better than Blake + Famar were doing (in terms of passing) and they were playing pretty damned well for the pretty decent Lakers (like 10-9 or so before our PGs started falling one by one).

So a good conclusion is that yeah Marshall is an above-average, maybe even great passer. But that doesn't mean his assist numbers aren't also inflated. It can be both! And it is."

internetsaremagic,DnD,1391025048.0,"I DM. Whilst venturing to an ancient mountain barrow they came upon two kobold hunters cornered by their quarry, a massive sabertooth cat, the party intervenes and saves the lives of the hunters. The more well armed and less malnourished of the two Hipkrik claims that the party owes him for stealing his kill. He demands they come to his leader in the barrows that she might decree justice upon them. Playing along to find the entrance to the barrows the party walked at spear point into the barrows where they found a small tribe of kobolds who had claimed a section of ruin as their own.
 Titus (chaotic neutral drow sorcerer disguised as an elf) decides to talk to their leader, because he was so amused by the situation, the kobold leader says that if they clear out the other inhabitants of the barrows then their names would be cleared. Still very amused and now fond of Hipkrik because he was such an imbecile Titus agrees on behalf of his party to clear out the barrows (since they had planned on it anyway). This led to many MANY hilarious moments. Hipkrik passing a basin of water bends over it and laps some up, Ryze (half drow rogue neutral) asks why he did that, and incredulously Hipkrik wide eyed ""Your people don't drink water?"" I think you had to be in the room for the full effect...  Eventually they cleared out the barrows and returned to the chieftain who offered them one of three rewards. Naturally the party wanted them all and Titus snatched them and ran out into the barrow hallway where he proceeded to cast a fancy minor image over the door he ran through. He explained that any who ran through the door would be transported to one of the infinite layers of the abyss where they would receive agonizing torture beyond their ken, and upon their death the door would vomit them back into the room, a mindless ghoul, to devour their loved ones. He had maxed his bluff and rolled a 20. So they all cowered in the back of their room... They got off just fine and with lots of treaure. 
Later though they felt some remorse because the kobolds would starve if they never left the room, I let them know that Hipkrik wouldn't let that happen and he'd toss one of the weaker ones through to see if it was safe. 


TL;DR: Kobolds are very gullible, ad illogical. "

TheGloriousNose,AskReddit,1391025121.0,"If you want to learn how to drive in this stuff, go find an iced over, empty parking lot and practice. Deliberately slide, learn how to make it stop and control it. The road is not the place to learn. If you're in a really front heavy rear wheel drive vehicle (such as a pickup without 4WD) just don't bother.

There are three basic scenarios where you lose control of a vehicle: understeer, oversteer, and total.

Oversteer is when the back tires lose traction (so while you're steering, say, left suddenly the front end is going left way too quickly.) Get off the gas and brake and steer the direction you want to go. Slow, fluid motions are key - jerking the steering wheel will break the front tires free.

Understeer is when the front tires lose traction while cornering. Let's say you're navigating a left hand corner - if the front tires break away, your nose will go straight into whatever's in front of you. Handling this situation is a bit trickier than oversteer - it's less intuitive. Again, get off the gas and brake (basically solid advice whenever something goes wrong in the snow.) Your impulse will be to steer further the direction you want to go - in the scenario above, further left. You actually need to move the wheel in the other direction until you regain traction. Think about the tread on the tires - you need the tread to start tracking with the ground again instead of sliding. Once you've regained traction, slowly and carefully start steering back in the direction you want to go.

(Side note - in my younger days, I would deliberately oversteer very quickly and get the car going in a straight line with the wheel jammed totally to the left, then switch to the right while still going in a straight line.)

Total loss happens when all 4 tires lose traction at once. If this happens, you better be alone with 2-3 lanes of space to play with. Your car will start spinning. Once you're around 30 degrees from the direction you want to be going, steer out of the skid and hit the brakes. This is pretty much the only time you want to hit the brakes while sliding. At this point, you're basically praying that the Snow Gods bring you to a stop before you hit anything."

itsnotgoingtohappen,relationships,1391025181.0,"Funny thing about dystopian young adult literature: if you consider the target audience, the oppressive authorities can easily represent parents and authorities in a young adult's life. 

Let me back this up just a bit, though. Teens are biologically at a point where they should, at least evolutionarily, be starting their own families and running their own households BUT the modern world has pushed that timeline back substantially. As such, the power struggle at home between teens and parents isn't just a rebellion thing, it's a biology thing. 

So here's this power struggle that many teens are engaged in - it's the foundation for universally relatable themes like seeking independence from an oppressor, becoming your own hero, and coming of age. 

So you switch parents out for a totalitarian society in which the story's protagonist is a lowly nobody. But something sets the protagonist apart. This person is a hero, a snowflake savior among his or her people who are struggling just to live under the iron fist of the powers that be. He or she just doesn't know it yet. So the story is about the hero coming into his or her own and challenging the powers that be, rising above them, and starting (or being a keystone in the start of) a just new world order. 

It's not to say these kinds of novels encourage rebellion, but they can certainly be much more powerful to a young adult trying to find herself than they're usually credited."

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391025228.0,"Totalitarianism is always a concern to be worried about. I'm concerned about it, honestly too. Especially with those whole NSA spying thing. Sounds like 1984 to me.

However, I also recognize that our constitution is built on the ideal of separating powers, and limiting factions as much as possible. So at the same time, I have at least some confidence in our institutions. 

What I'm most concerned about is the state favoring corporate interests. I feel like businesses are often an unchecked fourth branch of government that at the very least seriously influences congress and the presidency (I think the courts are a bit more isolated from this). And I'm concerned as the aforementioned conditions worsen, the government can be persuaded by these businesses to instead make policies to help everyone like my own calls for a universal basic income, but to instead favor their interests at the expense of others, and maintain the status quo even though it is falling apart and leading to massive suffering. Benito Mussolini once defined ""fascism"" as the merger of state and corporate power, and I actually see this as more of a threat than any form of marxism in our near future.

So from my perspective, yes, it's right to be concerned about a future government that appears marxist/communist because it has control over the economy, but I'm more concerned now about our government favoring the rich at the expense of others. 

That being said, I am also scared for the future and agree you probably lived in the golden age in America. I don't feel like my generation has the opportunity yours had, and I think unless our attitudes change soon, things are only gonna get worse."

If you think about it, what is the difference between if she offers another guy sex and he declines vs offering and he accepts? The intent is already there, which in my book constitutes cheating as much as actually going through with the act. I can't wrap my head around why people have this notion that the actual act of having sex is paramount to cheating, and why one sex act is any worse than another. For that reason I don't feel that being the other party to cheating is morally wrong, unless the other party has a relationship with the person being cheated on in some way."

Probably not 100% accurate, because I have both fallen asleep at my computer and have laid awake for an hour after shutting it off while still feeling drowsy.  A funny thing, the mind is.

It was supposed to be a very miserable place which, apparently, people described in their (past life) sessions. Hubbard had collected sufficient evidence, according to the sound of his voice. I was lucky enough to hear 50 difficult to find audio lecture tapes of Hubbard's. It seemed to me that he expressed himself as the savior of all galaxies who was recruting all of us lost souls. He repeatedly used the term ""space opera"" which seemed to disrespect any possibility of sanity throughout all galactic life. I felt it all deserved more exploration as it was packaged together with so much empowering tech-- With promises like: ""total cause over matter, energy, space, time, life and thought"".

The unemployed and people who live on pensions might have it a little bit rougher, but they are a very small number of people compared to the minimum wage population, so the net effect should still be positive.

PirateCodingMonkey,askgaybros,1391025360.0,"first, understand that anal play is *not* required for a gay relationship. if you are not ready for it, or don't find it something you want to do, tell your partner.

now, on to the real question, how to prepare yourself.

first, an enema is not *critical* as long as you have a good diet. if you have normal, firm bowel movements, and have a bowel movement before you have anal play, you should be pretty well empty. on the other hand, if you have soft stools, you may want to use the enema. also, get more fiber in your diet. it's good for your health in general.

second, take it slow. use lots of lube - more than you think is needed. relax and take a deep calming breath before he begins penetrating you. you will feel a little pain and discomfort - that's natural. however, if it is really painful, tell him to stop. if possible, see if the first time you can do it by having him lay down and you getting on top and sitting on his cock. this allows you to control how fast he enters. also, some men find the reverse cowboy (where your back is to him) is easier on the first try.

finally, tell him up front that you want him to go slow. if he is a good lover, he will understand. if he isn't, then why are you letting him fuck you lol? as a guy with a larger than average cock, when i top, i make sure to take it slow and make sure that my lover is ok.

communication is important. if he is going to fast, tell him. if it hurts, tell him to stop. if you aren't comfortable, make sure he knows. he's not there to rape you, so you have a say in what happens."

hence the question ""what do you really want to see here?""

content isn't automatically voted on, and in most cases, upvotes drastically outweigh downvotes on reddit - but not in /r/chicago -- this suggests there is one or more of the following:

- a never ending mismatch between what users post and what users want to see (unlikely)

- a group of people who hate certain types of content so much that they're far more motivated than average redditors to vote (e.g. questions about the city)

- a group of people downvoting content as a way to help other content  (e.g. theirs) get exposure (not suggesting this is likely, just listing possibilities)

- some other unknown factor(s) that makes /r/chicago seem quite a bit different from a lot of the rest of reddit...

DeltaIndiaCharlieKil,woodworking,1391025500.0,"Just be very conscious of how high or low you put the mattress. It's hard to tell where you are putting it because the sides are large, but if you plan on having it mainly inset into the bed, that can be a real pain in the ass to make. Having to lift the entire mattress all the way out of a built in bed in order to tuck the sheets under it sucks. This may not be a problem  if you are planning on having the base start near the top of the side frames, but if not I would reconsider those side heights and maybe bring them down some. 

Good work. Would love to see pics when it's all finished and in the space!

edit: I'm not sure why this would get downvotes. I don't care about points, but it's good advice and shouldn't be discounted.

seanomenon,stopdrinking,1391025561.0,"First off, congratulations on 5 months. That's huge. Keep it up!

There is so much to this, so many ways to look at it, it sort of boggles the mind. It would be nice if she expressed the same joy you feel at your change in lifestyle, of course. But she can't feel the same joy you feel, because she is not you. She hasn't been through what you've been through. I honestly think we all need to be sober for ourselves, keep sober for our own improvement. If you do it for anyone else, that person will inevitably disappoint you, and then its an excuse to drink. You're not sober for her, you're sober for you. The sober you is probably a much better boyfriend for her, of course. But if she didn't know you drunk, then she has no basis of comparison. Or maybe she does know, but doesn't know how much or how little to express about the change. (Sober drunks can be notoriously moody about people who make a big deal of our sobriety, too.) And maybe she was into the movie and didn't relish the interruption. That's how I get: ""save it for after the movie, man!""

There is a prevailing opinion in AA that one shouldn't date in the first year of sobriety. I think there is something to this folk wisdom. In that first year sober, we are getting to know ourselves, getting comfortable in our own skin again, learning to live authentic emotional lives without crutches or excuses. I don't say this to put your relationship down, not at all. My point is that I think it would be good for you to recognize that your feelings are all over the place, and just keep in mind that you may not be reacting completely rationally. (This is always a good thing to keep in mind, IMHO.)

Lastly, you might simply try telling her. We have a lot of myths about relationships and one of the most damaging is that your SO shares a deep emotional connection. There is an emotional bond, but that doesn't translate to mind-reading. Talk about it. Tell her this is a big deal to you, and you wish she made a bigger deal of it. Then listen to what she has to say in response. There's no better medicine for relationships, as far as I know. 

Congratulations again on your 5 months sober. Keep it up!"
Khatib,Games,1391025561.0,"So what happens with taking over space in EVE is a complicated series of events that have to happen.  Blow this claim unit up, place your own, wait for it to online, shoot shields off moon bases, come back and shoot the structure down after an invuln timer, shoot the station hitpoints down -- doesn't blow it up but switches ownership...  (I haven't played in a long while so I can't give the specifics of current sov mechanics, they always change a bit with expansions)

Anyways, all kinds of stuff like that, with all kinds of timers that happen once you start the process.  Once there are all these timers going, the defenders know exactly when to be there to defend and can assemble accordingly.  In general, they also have some control over when the timers will kick off, so they can place the fight in timezones numerically advantageous for themselves.  Maybe they're stronger in EU and weaker in NA, etc.

BUT -- in the case of that fight yesterday -- since someone fucked up and didn't pay their sovereignty bill, control just ... dropped.  With none of the processes needed to slog through and fight through.  Which left the system wide open and up for grabs without going through days or weeks of grinding back and forth on timers.  

So yes, the battle was completely unplanned.  Something bad happened for the defenders, leaving them wide open, and the attackers pounced as hard as they could at short notice.

There definitely would have been a giant flurry of Jabber pings going out on both sides, calling people to log in.  Many players even have Jabber apps on their phones so they can get important pings to login for big unplanned fights even when away from their PCs."

And while it's clear that average fighters are capable of exceptional things when pushed--such as Nes Stark's defeat of Arthur Dayne, or Jorah Mormont's defeat of Jaime Lannister--it seems clear that Martin intended to out Jorah Mormont in the ""average"" category, and Bronn in the ""exceptional"" category."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1391025614.0,"Because nobody brought it up, in this case, in the context of custodial fathers. In which case, the law does require non-custodial parents, regardless of gender, to pay child support. For the bringing up of their child. Not for what the parent ""needs,"" other than in respect to raising a kid. And minimums are set deliberately low to avoid arrests and delinquency. For many families, they do not equal the amount required to bring up a child solely on that support with a decent standard of living.

Requiring adoption or abandonment fees seems logical, yes, but in practice, it doesn't make a lick of sense. The government services are supposed to be supported by tax revenue, not the parents of abandoned children. Additionally, the kind of people who abandon children or give them up for adoption are often young (even minors themselves), in legal or financial trouble, or addicts. Requiring a fee before abandonment or adoption would have the side affect of persuading parents who couldn't pay the fee to keep the the child. Which would result in a worse outcome for both the child and the biological parent(s).

I really don't see the issue with child support regimes (perhaps other than being too permissive with delinquent payments in some states, and too low for adequate standard of living in others) and the law when it comes to abandonment/adoption given the realities of what children need to thrive.

A philosophical calculus that fails to consider reality and/or the needs of the child is a broken calculus. It's like trying to build a plane without accounting for wind resistance, then being puzzled when people criticize your prototype when it uselessly falls, flaming, to the earth."

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391025681.0,"&gt; I understand what you're saying, and I disagree with several points. Whether or not these guys getting shamed for being virgins (even if allegedly so) go out and get laid is irrelevant to the person doing the insulting. Virgin shaming is not trying to evoke a behavior in men. It is just ridiculing them for a lack of that behavior.

I gave *three* examples. It is *often* used to ridicule men for nonmasculine behaviour. 

You are trying to argue intent, and I'm saying that does not matter, because we're not mind readers. The end result is still that both forms of shaming can affect behaviour.

&gt; Which is it?

It is both. The main distinction is in the directness of it. That is all.

And don't bring up the global perspective until you can seriously back it up, because I've found many feminist try to coopt other countries' woes into their own agenda without ever having left their own country. It's a serious pet peeve of mine.

Unless most of us live in Middle East we won't be able to come to fair conclusions, and we'll be running around arguing over things like slut shaming vs male victims being considered militants vs gender ratios, etc using very focused lenses. It's not a fair way to discuss things.

&gt; You are arguing that virgin is shaming is worse,

That is your *projection*. I only drew distinctions between the two forms of shaming. The only direct comparisons were early on when I said that I see ""virgin shaming"" more frequently online (it's obvious on reddit), and yet the problems are discussed far less. Not that one is metaphysically worse than the other.

You are the only one playing oppression olympics and implicitly drawing a quantitative comparison here in the top of this comment chain:

*""I do think that slut shaming and calling someone a virgin neck beard are* **not on the same level** *because of what I explained above."" ~polyhooly*"

raziphel,hometheater,1391025693.0,"Do you want floor-standing speakers, bookshelves, or satellites?  What kind of music do you like?  how big is the room?  are you in an apartment?  **How much are you willing to spend?**

Every amp is going to have an RCA input, so don't worry about that.  Get your amp from an audio-only company: denon, yamaha, etc.  Ideally, one with lots of other inputs and the ability to program the display (so it can read 'xbox' instead of 'input 7 or vcr 1').  do you want all the video ran through the receiver and have it function as a switch?  Do you want it to power speakers in another room (that listen to a different music source)?  

speakers are more dependent your personal taste, because they'll all sound slightly different.  Klipsch are bright on the high end (and loud), Infinity are more neutral, and so on.  

get your wires from monoprice.  investigate banana plugs for the speaker wires, too, because they make hookup very easy.

I have a Denon with Infinity bookshelf speakers.  It works well for what I need."

There is this concept of Advaita Vedanta, ""non-dualist wisdom,"" that all is one.  All divisions are false and part of the *maya,* and Brahman (God) is the only absolute truth.  That isn't to say that the *maya* is false, but that it is impermanent, and thus can't be the absolute truth.  The only absolute Truth is God, and God is all.  Everyone and everything is God, and you have (eventually, probably over many lives) come to that realization and rejoin the eternal truth."

As far as cup-caps acting as defense for flagships? All the time. A flagship does not leave safety without a fleet. Period. This means carriers, titans, dreads -- all will have a fleet escort. Period.

In my little slice of space, we had one carrier and about 10 BSes and a few smaller ships as mandatory escort for the carrier in low-risk areas. The ability for a carrier to get ""scrammed"" (unable to jump) is huge. And all it takes is a few small ships scramming and locking down a carrier and getting on fleet channels for a juicy, juicy kill. It comes down to whose fleet is faster to reinforce at that point."
mr_fishy,knitting,1391025739.0,"Generally I try to come up with my own patterns for things. Sometimes I'll have close friends say ""I found this pattern, will you make it for me?"" and I'll only charge them a little extra plus materials cost, but I also sell online and at conventions. On my Etsy shop and at cons I won't sell something made from a pattern unless I get permission from whoever made the pattern. A lot of times in the pattern copyright the original creator will specify whether or not it's okay to sell finished pieces made from their patterns.

As far as photos taken from things you make, even if you didn't design the pattern, I'd say that's okay. It's like building a portfolio - you're showing off your skill and technique. To make a comparison, photographers make money selling their prints all the time, even if they didn't make the thing they're photographing (buildings, animals, etc.) because the part they're selling is the *photograph*, which takes skill and effort.

As far as pricing goes, for larger projects I usually charge by the week, medium projects by the day, and small projects by the hour. For instance, if I make an accessory that only takes about 2 hours to make, I'll charge around $15 (minimum wage where I live is about $7.50, I worked two hours on it, it's tiny enough that I don't care about materials). If it takes me a weekend to finish a scarf, I charge about $25 (estimating $5 for yarn and $10 for each day). If it's a bigger project like the pillows or bags I've made, I'll charge about $10 per week plus materials.

It's basically a sliding scale. I still want to make money for all the effort I put into something, but I also want to keep it from becoming so ridiculously expensive that no one will buy it. For instance, I once made someone a sweater for a costume. I probably put 70+ hours into that sweater. But I wasn't about to charge them per hour, as that would have become a $500 sweater. No one will pay that."

rankao,AskMen,1391025750.0,"Well jealousy isn't really a classified emotion. It's a result in various emotions, such as, anger, resentment, and inadequacy. Almost all emotions are trigger by something. Body Chemistry, Environment, or a specific mindset on something. It's better to understand WHY you're jealous than to think. ""Oh I'm jealous and that's just natural. I don't have to check myself."" You're not paying care to your mental health. 

It's not really a insult as more of a cause. Why are you jealous your girlfriend hangs out with a couple of guy friends. You don't feel your relationship is secure and  you don't feel she's loyal/honest. It's a personal insecurity of the relationship. It could totally be a valid insecurity. Maybe she's taking two dicks at a time, or just talking about their favorite book. Once you recognize it you can easily address the issue.  You don't have to be direct. You just need to express these feelings in a way that makes the other person feel not attacked. 

You can't just dismiss your emotions as ""natural"" you need to understand why you're having them. You see a black guy hit on a white women you get angry. Maybe you're racist. Someone cut you off on the way home from work. That douche endangered your life. That's understandable. Someone appears to have a more interesting life than you? You feel left out and incapable achieving something similar. All of these can be address personally as opposed to just having an emotion and thinking they're all okay. "

AdamColligan,askscience,1391025869.0,"Maybe you need to be clearer about what you mean when you say ""know"".  It takes a certain amount of time for all influences to reach an observer. So at any given instant, how do you ""know"" that the ground under the building you are in hasn't just collapsed, or that a nuclear bomb has not just exploded nearby, or that the Sun has not disappeared in the past 8 minutes?  When you are talking about distant galaxies, the difference is only of degree, not of kind.

Without getting too philosophical, one way to talk about how you ""know"" the state of nearby objects is that you know what they were like in the recent past, and you know the rules they play by. If you are in the outfield, and you see a batter hit a ball on a certain trajectory, you can confidently take off running toward the spot where you calculated the ball will land, even if you're not watching it the whole time.

Now, you can't say with a deep, religious certainty that something totally outside the known bounds of the game of baseball hasn't interfered with the ball while you had your eye off of it -- a bird, a plane, Superman, whatever.  And the same is technically true of distant cosmological objects. But in general, observations of the universe support an assumption that the basic laws of physics are the same at all points in space and time. You can look way over in one direction, right back almost to the Big Bang, and see that things look more or less like they do way over in the other direction, even though they can't be influencing each other.

So we look at distant objects and see that they match our models of how galaxies like ours could have gotten started. We look at intermediate objects and see then behaving just like you would expect if they were following the known rules of astrophysics and were in an intermediate state between being like early objects and being like nearby, present objects. And we look at nearby objects and see that they are behaving like you would expect the intermediate and distant objects to behave if you gave them enough time.  

From this, we conclude that the most reasonable thing to expect is that each time we can check back up on a distant object to see how it is progressing, there won't be any radical surprises. "

prolepunk,AskWomen,1391025924.0,"You probably don't realize how much effort it takes to juggle 3 girls. I'm fairly average looking, it would take unrealistic amount of time just to get there. Or my strategy is flawed -- I usually ask someone out after 4-8 messages. 

Usually after one date it's fairly obvious if there's going to be another date, so I kind of know if I should slow down or proceed with whoever else I'm messaging at the moment. 

Personally, the rate of 1 date/week  is good, I think I only had 2 dates a week and I felt like it was a bit overwhelming -- even then, one of the girls messaged me first, something that occurs really infrequently.

Again, putting someone ahead in your mind is something that only happens in your mind and isn't an objective reality, next date might be horrible, or there might be no next date, it's putting too many eggs in one basket.

It's not fair to others to string them along, yet other people will do that to you with no problem, I used to be overly sensitive about this, but no longer. I figured I'm fine being on the other end for short amount of time  i.e. up to two dates, as long as the girl is honest with me I'm okay with that. Hearing -- ""I've been seeing someone else and it's taking off"", is much better than ""I can only be friends, in fact I'm not looking to date anyone at this point"", for that matter the former is honest and I have no reason to take it personally whereas the latter is disingenuous as the girl tries to spare my feelings rather than explaining her reasoning. (Though for the latter I might be partially responsible)

About being rebound for someone -- I don't think I'm given choice in the matter even in hypothetical sense.
First of all there's a good chance I won't even be aware of that situation, and if that's the main reason -- I don't think anything will progress beyond 3-5 dates."

They are paid - when the seeds are purchased the first time, just like with non-GMO seeds.

&gt; the company would soon go bankrupt, and farmers would see yield reductions, which would lead to food shortages.

Nonsense. There are plenty of non-Monsanto crops to plant. North America produces a surplus of food every year. Monsanto going bankrupt would not lead to any food shortages.

&gt; By the way, what was the first ""strike""? I will point out that there's a reason that these crops were developed - they do provide massive yield boosts in comparison to non-modified crops. And yields aren't really an issue when there is so much overproduction.

The first strike is the moral objection to transgenics. The second strike is the legal objection to allowing patents on life forms that can reproduce on their own.

GMO crops don't provide massive yield boosts. At best they provide modest yield boosts.

JonWood007,PoliticalDiscussion,1391026003.0,"That's what I want of people in society. But at the same time, that's why I'm skeptical of unregulated capitalism (once again going back to our earlier discussion). Why should the people who control the resources, give you access to any of them if they're not profitable? Capitalism was a great thing for the 19th and 20th centuries, but I see those goals you mentioned as incompatible with it in the 21st.

One way to solve our unemployment crisis would be to shorten the work week. But why would those at the top want the work week shortened? Paying people more to work less would hurt their bottom line. Rather, then trend over the last 40 years or so has been to work more for less. And corporations love it! They can boss people around as they want, and they'll just put up with it because it's either that or be homeless and stuff. They can make people do more for less!

Another alternative would be the basic income, which is a form of wealth redistribution, but once again, why should they get on board with it? There's no profit for it, it actually cuts into their profits. 

Quite frankly, I see 2008 as a bit of a restructuring, and all this unemployment and poverty, I think it's the new normal. Because if you're up at the top, controlling all the wealth, things must be looking pretty great for you. And automation? Automation is a threat under such a system, it's something to fear, it's not something to embrace. Because this will just throw more people out of work, and make them more desperate. And this will further strengthen their bargaining position over people, and make them willing to work even harder for even less.

So yeah, I'm definitely scared for the future. I want a society in which people have increased freedom, and increase living standards, etc., but I really fear we'll go down one of several dystopian roads rather than the utopian ones."

Max_Insanity,AskReddit,1391026009.0,"With 14, I was so depressed that I had a constant wish to kill myself. At the time, I hadn't heard of depressions and had no clue that they were likely to get worse, no matter the outer circumstances. And boy, did it get worse, even though at the time I wouldn't have had it deemed possible after years of heavy bullying and neglect.

I didn't commit suicide at the time because I didn't want to hurt the few people who were still close to me. So I clawed my way back up. Relearned basic social skills, made my way through school, found some really good friends and none of that fell in my lap, it was all through conscious effort and perseverance.

Later on, I didn't kill myself because the mental barrier became too strong. Know how when you say something like: ""I'm going to do that tommorrow"", chances are, you will say it again the day after? Each time you fail to break a mental barrier, it grows stronger. In the end, I was unable to do it, even though there was nothing I would have liked more.

Fought my way through that, too and now I'm feeling better than I ever had, studying to become a teacher to be there for others, partially so I can help some of them not go through what I had to (no chance for that for teachers in the US, but lucky for me, I'm not from there).

Lets look at things more closely. We have a law that says that people must support a child financially. However this law does not come into play if a child is not born. 

And that is where the discrepancy lies. On the surface that child support law seems to be fair and equal, but because of other laws, women have a way of circumventing that law (abortion, safe haven laws), so in actuality the law is not fair.

kuma_k,gaming,1391026067.0,"Your ""level of challenge"" is entirely subjective.  What's hard for you isn't necessarily hard for me.  People are always quick to claim a game (MMO's specifically), are too easy or too simple, yet they've never actually accomplished everything there is to do.

WoW is a perfect example.  Less than 1% of its total population actually clears the entirety of its current content (Heroic raids, basically).  If you're not being challenged in your MMO, you're either not actively seeking it, or you are in the 1%.  If you're in the 1%, then you have to realize that *your* definition of ""hard"" is at a *much* higher level than the other 99%.  MMO's are a business, and developing content solely for the 1% just isn't smart.  Retention is much more important.

And no, MMO's aren't dead.  It's just not the same atmosphere we had back in 2004, when MMO's were exploding.  It may start feeling overly saturated, but at least we have options on what we choose to waste our time on.

On the other hand, I also feel like a lot of people have a bad case of nostalgia-glasses.  We all gush over that warm fuzzy feeling we get when thinking about the ""good ol' days"", but we also didn't know better when it came to MMO's.

When we first considered ditching condoms, he hadn't gotten the full all clear from his vasectomy but we had a long conversation about the low risk and potential outcomes and decided we were comfortable with the odds."

Honestly I think that's a part of the core debate about trans people. It is a mental health issue. Mental disorders are often seen as less real than physical ones, and everything is always clearly divided into mental or physical instead of addressing things that can be both. People see mental disorders as something that should be solved with counselling and meds instead of surgery.

But I think it doesn't really matter. You could call it a mental disorder, or a physical one - the real problem is the mental and physical don't match. If this is better treated by surgery and hormones than by counselling, then wouldn't it be better to treat it this way? And actually I think the same thing about people who get plastic surgery - if it's a one or two time deal with a clear goal, it's fine. It fixes the anxiety, they have a better life, all is well. When the problem is clearly not being fixed with more surgery (e.g. surgery addictions), it's time for a different approach. For me it's just about treating a problem in the most effective way possible."

Vordreller,dawngate,1391026404.0,"20 games per shaper?

Well, compare it to league of legends then. 6300 IP points per hero, less for the older ones.

So let's take 6300. Per match, you'll be lucky to earn 60 IP on a win and 40IP on a loss. And 150IP once per day.

First, without the once per day bonus.

That's 105 matches for a single champ, if you win all those matches. If you have a 50% win rate, that means 126 matches.

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%28x%2F2%29*40+%2B%28%28x%2F2%29*60%29+%3D+6300

Let's be reasonable and say 4 matches a day, that's 115 matches before you get 1 single champ.

To calculate that, I divided 6300 by 150, that's 42. Divided by 4, for one of the 4 matches per day, is 10.5.

Rounded up is 11. 126-11 = 115"

I agree that they're not paid what they're worth.  That's my point.  Higher paid jobs will adjust upwards until minimum wage is back at equilibrium compared to all other jobs.

&gt;that is not the reason at all for inflation. inflation since 2009 is because of interest rates being very low. that was done to avoid a prolonged recession.

I never said that was the reason for inflation.  Straw man.

&gt;that seems like a contradictory statement. as long as min wage keeps up with inflation, it maintains the same value relative to a basket of goods.

How often do you propose to adjust minimum wage so that it keeps up with inflation?"

[Abusive Narcisism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_abuse):

&gt; Parents who require the child to give up their own wants and feelings in order to serve the parent's **needs for esteem**.

The mother is certainly controlling and overprotective, but nothing about the therapy sessions, the strict schedule or the confiscations has anything to do with her esteem. Quite the opposite: if the mother was a narcisistic parent, she'd only care about her daughter's grades (instead of letting her fail semi-intentionally).

In contrast:

[Overparenting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting_styles#Other_parenting_styles):
&gt; Parents who try to involve themselves in every aspect of their child's life, often **attempting to solve all their problems** and **stifling the child's ability to act independently or solve his own problems**."

It's because law A can be avoided by using law B, but law b is only usable by women. Law b is only usable by women because of biological factors, but law b and what it entails is a creation of humans separate from biology.

It boils down to this. Human advances has given more choices to women. Yet at the same time, this advancement has now enabled women to get out of a restriction imposed by a law also created by humans. So lets take the law before we had abortion.

Cananbaum,AskReddit,1391026680.0,"Most people don't understand that people other than degenerates and teenagers work at these menial jobs. 

You have college kids trying to pay their way through school, or a single mom who's degree or experience doesn't exist anymore and took the job out of desperation. My mother worked for over 30 years running Marriott hotels as a manager and human resources. What used to be a team of people is now a fat person behind a single computer. What my mother did doesn't really exist anymore, it's scenarios like that.               

Now, what people don't understand is this - it is the middle class that has the most power, or should. Strength in an economy like in America comes from the buying power that the middle class should have.

Imagine if you will a Jenga stack as a whole. It's pretty sturdy. Now break it into thirds. Top, middle and bottom. The wealthy, middle class, and the impoverished. Start taking away from the middle of the stack and only the middle and unlike you're playing Jenga, add those blocks to the base. Before long the bottom is supporting all the weight of the top until the top eventually collapses to the ground because there is nothing left in the middle to support it all. 

This is what is happening in America. By keeping [minimum] wages stagnant you are taking away from the middle class and when the middle class has no buying power, money doesn't go up anymore and they are forced into poverty. Soon, when there isn't enough money flowing upwards and the top collapses. 

Companies are experiencing record profits because of it all, but the pendulum swings the other way and soon, there won't be enough money flowing to the top because people aren't able to buy the products the companies are offering because all their money is being used to keep themselves fed and trying to survive, but it turns out to not be enough as costs rise and more and more people are forced into poverty.

Dajbman22,AskMen,1391026698.0,"I had the same problem my first time. It was mainly the nerves for me, but also even with my average girth the mix of nerves and the tight tug of the condom really threw me off. I actually never really lost my virginity with my first serious girlfriend because of it... we only attempted actual PIV sex when things were already kind of slipping downhill for us, and we decided not to give it another go for a while. By the time I felt ready to try again, things were practically over between us and that ship hand long past sailed. With my next GF (and current SO), she was a virgin as well and we actually waited a full year of dating (and fooling around in every other way) before I felt comfortable giving it another shot. It took three attempts with her for me to get out of my own head, but luckily she had all the patience in the world, and the third time was the charm. Once I was inside of her, it was like a gigantic weight was lifted off of my shoulders and I could just relax. Since that one point I never had performance issues (without being nearly blackout drunk) again. 

I just wish someone had told me there wasn't something majorly wrong with me at the time, as I held off on having sex for over a year and a half because of my fear of not being able to perform. I now know it was completely normal, and the best thing to do is keep trying until it becomes ""normal"" enough for my nerves to not mess me up. "

pizzaandburritos,AskReddit,1391026775.0,"Basically the most efficient thing is to run a few times a week and vary your workouts so that some days you go slow, some days you go fast, some days short, some days long. Always do some dynamic stretching (like lunges and stuff) before you start and get a nice static stretch in at the end, to make you less sore the next day. Running might suck at first but it normally gets the best results. 

I prefer running outside or on an indoor track to running on treadmills. The biggest challenge to yourself is the mental defeat, not your body. Treadmills are just inherently dull and defeating. If you dress appropriately, you can run outside in pretty cold weather without a problem. You can also get a jump rope if your gym does not have an indoor track. I'd say that is still a better cardio workout than using the elliptical. 

Combine cardio with some weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, making sure to keep your heart rate up while you do them. Don't rest too much between sets--rest somewhere between a 30 seconds and 90 seconds, just enough to barely catch your breath. Go for exercises that target major muscle groups, such as pushups, pull-ups, squats, lunges, bridges, burpees, and mountain climbers. You can look up variants of those exercises online if you need a beginner version.

If all this sounds kind of daunting, look into taking zumba classes somewhere. It's basically aerobics. Pilates and yoga classes are also a great workout. The only thing I would say is that while these will tone you, they probably won't make you lose much weight. It could be a starting point, though.

I wouldn't really diet if I were you, I would just cut down on junk food. The rest of the time, just eat healthy-ish foods. Cut down a bit on dairy and red meat. Eat a fruit or veggie with every meal. Depriving yourself or counting calories is too tedious and you'll be too tired all the time. Keep a regular schedule -- it really helps. Try to eat bigger meals for breakfast and lunch and lighter meal for dinner. It can make a big difference to make sure you don't eat with 3 hours of going to bed. Feel free to snack, but plan out healthy snacks ahead of time so that hunger doesn't tempt you to splurge on junk. I'm no nutritionist, but this is what I would advise as a person who stays healthy without dieting. 

It all boils down to this: the surest way to lose weight is to do something that makes you sweat profusely for at least 30 minutes, at least three or four times a week. And I mean sweating by virtue of moving, not by being in a hot place."

 Some people say it's a way to buy friends, which definitely has some truth to it. It is a way to meet people and to network, but there are other ways to accomplish those things without spending thousands of dollars per semester. I can understand how joining one would make transitioning to college a easier by giving someone a sense of belonging and comradery from the get-go.

We win the draw off the opening faceoff, but the center wins it straight back and it splits the D and is headed towards the net.  By the time the puck had gotten back to our goalie, it was going very, very slowly.  Like trickling.  But somehow he managed to miss the timing on playing it with his stick, whiffed, and we all sighed as the puck slid into the net at the speed of mud.  

Fastest we've ever been down 1-0.

My list is massive, but they're all fairly standard stuff.  A clear cut breakaway and my iron hands result in me tripping myself up and not even getting a shot off.  Trying to reverse behind our own net and pile driving my face into the boards.  Leading an odd man rush and looking to make a play, only to realize I left the puck 10 feet behind me, countless times a puck is coming to me and something short circuits in my brain and I just completely miss the puck...  etc, etc, etc.  It doesn't happen as much though.

HalfysReddit,AskMen,1391026962.0,"I only ever got in one fight. It was pretty fucking amazing though, really wish I had it on video (we asked a VP but the cameras weren't facing us).

**STORY TIME URRBODY GRAB YOUR POPCORN AND PUT ON YOUR COMFY PANTS**

So, I'm in high school. At the time, I spent half of my school day at this alternative high school for vocational training (we called it votech). So I'd be in normal high school, than after half the day get bussed to votech, do a single class for the rest of the day there, and then get bussed back to my regular school. Pretty sweet huh?

Anyways, this particular story starts off on the ride back from votech. We're fucking around and having a paper ball fight.  Now this one dude Brendan, me and him weren't huge fans of each other. Not enemies really, just not super fond of one another. Anyways, he's got this cool plan right. He's gonna gather up like eight paper balls and throw them at me super close in the face all shotgun-style. So he does this James Bond shit, sneaks up behind me in my bus seat, and fails miserably when I preemptively block all the paper balls with a notebook (I saw him approaching and played it cool). He's a bit bummed but just returns to his seat.

Well I hold on to one of those balls. We get off the bus and I toss at him. Hit's him in the back of the head - should be no big deal right? Well apparently the section of his skull that I hit was right where his ego is located. I'm walking away with my buddy Brent when he starts running towards me with his fist balled up near his waist like he's going to throw some wild haymaker.

Now it's worth mentioning here that Brendan was on the wrestling team of our school. It's even more worth mentioning that I had spent the last decade studying Taekwondo and held four black belts.

So I notice him in the corner of my eye and decide, again, to play it cool. I keep walking. Right at the most opportune moment, I turn and plant a sidekick right into his chest. Between my fairly large stature, his momentum, and my heel in his chest, what happened was basically his chest stopped moving but his legs kept going. He's feet left the ground and he landed *flat* on his back with a thud.

Now, Brendan was hot-headed but he wasn't no idiot. He walked away after that. That was of course until he realized **every fucking person on our votech bus saw what happened** and was pointing and laughing. So he turns around, walks up to me, and does that whole shoulder-to-shoulder-walk-in-a-circle dance with me. I'm just staring at him, waiting to respond (I fight very defensively). He calls me a ""Taekwondo bitch"". After a few circles some people break us up (thankfully, because I really don't think either of us *wanted* to fight at that point in time).

We split, and headed off in different directions. Never got caught or in trouble. He did grab a bag of trash and dump it on my truck and spit on it before I got to it though. That was petty punk bullshit but whatever. He did also harass me when I was at work a few months later to let me know he started taking Judo classes or some such. Whatever. We asked one of the VPs (vice principal) that we were cool with if we could get a copy of the video from around that time, but alas the camera facing that area didn't have see wide enough to actually capture anything exciting.

**tl;dr** Planted my heel in this dude's chest and got called a Taekwondo bitch."

onthefence928,DebateReligion,1391026980.0,"&gt;Isn't it supposed to be a slow process? I feel animals would have time to adapt, move inward from the sea rather than being drowned, over hundreds of years as the ice melts and the water level rises.

slow by human lifetime standards, but by geological or evolutionary timescales. climate change by natural means takes millions of years. our current climate change has occured in little more then a century. 

&gt; I'm interested in the process in which geologists can determine that there wasn't a massive flood in several regions thousands of years ago. Please explain.

floods leave evidence in the form of sedentary rocks in the geological layers. we can know precisily when florida was underwater because of studies done of the layers of rock. it also how we know that it was a an astroid that took out the dinosaurs, because there is a thin layer of rock world wide that has isotopes only found in space.  if there was a flood on a multi-regional or global scale, there would be a layer in all of the affected regions in the same date range with similar properties unique to a sudden flooding. especially in regions that do not normally have sedimentary layers because they are never underwater.

&gt;There's multiple stories in multiple areas that have a flood. It's bigger than just the Jewish perspective of the flood. There's isolated cultures everywhere that have a flood story.

there are multiple stories, many of which predate the jewish culture, not to mention the abrahamic flood story. what im saying is that the evidence points to the flood story arising independently of the abrahamic flood in cultures with constant experience with floods. these stories also do not agree with the abrahamic flood story. so for multiple stories of similar events with contradictory details, and from vastly different times, wouldnt it be more rational to conclude that early humans saw significance in floods and each developed their own stories around their own experiences surviving floods. or would it be more rational to conclude that there was a global flood for which no evidence can be found where evidence should exist, and that the abrahamic traditions were the only ones to get the details, dates, and causes correct?

**EDIT1:** An update:

/u/Sudeep1360 is our intermediary to Kesavan and his wife, Namita. I asked him the following questions:


1) How much money do they ideally need? For him? For the real team that they had in mind?

2) How long do they have?

3) If time is an issue, can they borrow on credit?

4) When will they be back with a good internet connection?

5) If they are not aware of dogecoin, we could potentially raise the money in coins, exchange it for $ and transfer it to a bank. Would they be okay with that?

6) How comfortable would they be in having a dogecoin logo somewhere on person or the equipment?

7) Could we ship equipment directly to Sochi? (pending reply) 

And his replies:

1) They were looking at around 5k USD. 

2) They have till it starts effectively. 

3) I doubt borrowing on credit would be ideal. 

4) Namita will have proper access around 4th. Feb, when they. Reach sochi. 5 

5) they are ok and 

6) is not allowed under the Olympics guidelines.

**EDIT4** Thanks for tipping me, guys. But while I want them, I don't need them. Please point your tip lasers at the address above. I am forwarding all the tips from this thread there.

**EDIT5** Shibe pups! We did it! We brought the moon down to us!! You guys are really something.

Okay! I am in touch with a friend of the athlete's and I have some more information. Many of you messaged me asking who really was in need of the money. Keshavan Shiva is. The other two luge athletes are not the focus of our fund raising. Apparently someone had told them recently that they would raise the required money, but didn't contact them after that. So they are a bit leery. Here is what the athlete's wife, Namita, had to say:

*Shiva is sponsored by the Olympic Gold Quest, and endorses a few brands in India. He has been managing to train and compete with all the money he raises personally. In simple words, he mainly represents the country at his own expense. FYI, the total required budget for a Season is approximately INR 50 Lakhs (~80K$), which Shiva has raised personally all these years. There are no facilities or infrastructure in India, which forces him to train abroad, something like the Jamaican team. It was 2 months prior to the 2010 Olympic Games and now for the 2014 Games that the Govt. offered support, nothing in the middle. Also, please note that they were part sanctions, which means they only gave him 5-10% of the total amount actually required by him. I write all this for your information, so that it is clear who and why you all are supporting the Indian athletes.*

The money you guys raised will help cover cost of equipment and travel. We are waiting for Namita to get back online so that we can figure a way to give her the money.

ValarDohaeris,Mommit,1391027006.0,"That might be your best bet. Parenting... there's no one true way, or one right answer. You could try browsing /r/parenting to see what books they recommend; there are a lot of different ""styles"" of parenting and you should try to figure out what works best for you and adapt it as necessary to fit your ideals. As an example, my husband and I took a lot of pages from attachment parenting but we also did a modified ""cry it out"" routine where we let our son cry for about 5-10 minutes (and intervened if he started crying hard to avoid him being in a panic). Now he happily walks over to his room at 17mo when we ask if he wants to take a nap or go to bed for the night, lays down all by himself, and whenever he wakes up in the middle of the night he just drinks some of his water cup and hums to himself before going back to bed. He sleeps til like 9-10am every morning. So, clearly, we didn't break him even though we merged two (very different, according to some) schools of thought.

In the long run you'll probably end up reading a lot more than two books about both subjects. We have one book called Un-Stuff Your Life that we're trying to work through to reduce our clutter since we have a tiny house, which helps build strong routines to make your life more organized (everything has a place, everything in its place).

honestbleeps,chicago,1391027101.0,"""what to do"" yes. but those aren't the ones getting all the downvotes.

&gt; As far as the downvotes, again who cares. Do not browse by whats hot, go to new or controversial instead.

You're really missing the point.

Have you ever heard the phrase ""you reap what you sow""?

It's not a perfect analog, but it's a decent one.  We can't control users behavior individually, we can't tell them ""browse this way"", and we also can't tell them what to submit.

just-visiting users just aren't going to read the rules (usually) and are going to be less selective about what they post - we can't really even try to influence them.

However, regular users tend to submit content they think will do well, etc -- by seeing what does well / poorly.  The voting pattern here implies that what ""should"" be posted is skyline pics and memes, and what ""shouldn't"" be posted is any sort of actual interesting news article about Chicago, biographies about interesting Chicago personalities, etc...

the wrong message (my opinion of course... I can't speak for everyone) is being sent, seemingly due to not enough participation on the upvoting side and/or posts being stifled by a group of curmudgeonly downvoters.

that's what this discussion is about. it's not about ""I personally am too stupid to ignore that a post has been downvoted and read it anyway""."

Honestly? Even if she did miraculously decide that she wanted to be in a relationship with you, you should ~~walk~~ run away. Her manipulative and deceptive practices will just get worse in a relationship. 

Want to know why? When you told her that you had feelings for her, what does she do? She tells you no and then tries to hold your hand. That's not what friends do. When was the last time you held hands with a guy friend, outside of if they were about to fall off a cliff? Never? You wanna know why? Cause friends don't do that shit. What she did was unforgivable. Period. 

I see this going down as one of two ways:

* She doesn't contact you again and manipulates some other poor sap.
* She calls/texts you up and says something like ""we need to talk..."". If you take her up on it (which you shouldn't), she'll give some vague emotional but non-commital response like: ""I never realized how important you were to me until we stopped hanging out...""

Fitness goes away really quickly, yeah cardio makes gains less effective, but what's the point in big muscles if they have no endurance?

Although lifting is still a great workout, and more women should do it. Bodybuilders, both male and female, only look that huge for competition, when they're all bronzed up and have been cutting down for a couple of weeks and dehydrating themselves. Most of the time you'd hardly be able to tell a fit woman from a bodybuilder, especially under normal clothes."

yes there is a genetic component, but it isn't tied to race.  it is tied to sexual selection of that specific culture.  let me explain.  i'm going to assume you understand the basic tenets of evolution.  if the female values intelligence in her mate, the most intelligent are going to have increased reproductive fitness.  if the female wants a superior physical specimen, the biggest guys are going to have increased reproductive fitness.


what does that mean for cultures?  every girl wants to fuck the biggest, baddest guys.  however, some cultures are very strict so the girls can't sleep around.  these girls end up raising the kids of doctors/engineers.  other cultures don't have these strict rules, so these girls fuck the best physical specimen and raise their kids as single mothers.  this leads to a divergence in intelligence and physical size."

Bingo.

&gt; Also by that logic, you shouldn't eat any meat that isn't grass-fed, since those are fed these artificially selected crops...

I try not to. Grass-fed beef tastes better and is better for the cows. It also seems to be leaner, at least the quarter cow we bought this year is.

Also if you have a strong core you can survive a fight much easier. Punch to the stomach? No problem for someone with strong core. For someone with a weak core their head will be lowered an open for a knock out shot."

Focus on what you really want in a wedding and what is important. Don't let the cost bring you down. Eliminate the things that stress you out or that take the excitement out of the wedding. "

_TIXCY_,raisedbynarcissists,1391027635.0,"&gt; Ya know my mom did something similar, but in your case , this guy is a criminal and your mother is enjoying this. My mom always brought up a guy that I dated, just his name, whenever I talked good things about my husband. She did it to bring me down, to put me down, to make me feel bad, to ruin the good thing my husband did. It was a form of abuse, to put me in my place, to bring on pain.

It really is, and I really can't believe how long I went without realizing what she was doing. My mother had a favorite ex of mine, too. He was an asshole who beat me and did drugs and got me hooked on drugs for awhile, but he's still such an amazing guy, was perfect for me, and loved me more than anyone ever could. She says all these things and I think it's hilarious because he's constantly in and out of prison. Such a great guy!

&gt; When I read that she sent you a pic of the rapist and his happy xmas family, it made me sick. Your mom is fucking evil.

The first time she sent one, was right after I moved out. When I lived at home, guess who's picture was stuck on the fridge? Him, his wife, and his kid. Every time I got something out of the fridge I saw his face. Then I moved and one came in the mail, with a little note saying, ""I know how close you two were, he just had his 2^nd baby. Meet Emily!"" 

It's at the point now where it's harder for me to even bring it up to her. My brother did at one point, asked her to stop sending those pictures or bringing the guy up, and she's like, ""Well, **I** don't recall him ever doing anything bad to **us.**"" 

I'd go NC but her and my dad are divorcing and it's just too much drama to cut her off completely, even though my brother has for the most part.

**edit** the part that seriously amazes me, is that my mother was violently raped and abused as a child, continuing until she was almost 16. Yet it's impossible for her to imagine that someone could hurt her child?"

MoonRazer,leagueoflegends,1391027728.0,"I just want to second a few of your points: 

Ping a bunch right when you're heading in. Start about 3-4 seconds before the point of no return (you know where this is), and just smart ping ""on my way"" up to ten times. Don't let a gank fail because they weren't sure when you were going in. 

If they don't respond well, just leave then alone after that. Just farm up in the jungle and counter gank that shit. Go for first back at 6 min, you should have about 1K gold at that time. Buy your spirit stone, boots, a few pots and 1-2 wards. Run straight to their first buff (warding yours if you can) and sit near it until ~7:18 when it comes up. At this ELO, you can usually wait there for a few seconds (15-20s MAX) and the enemy jungler will likely go for one more gank before rebuffing. As soon as you see him on the minimap, secure his buff ASAP and then run straight to yours. Counter jungling is very easy at this ELO, but don't let it happen to yourself(just keep warding them, I usually leave a pink by one of mine).

And finally, find that jungler who works well for you. With the recent changes, nearly ANY champ can jungle. So explore a bit and find what fits your style. When all else fails, keep your farm up and don't EVER let your conservation hit 80 if you can avoid it. "

candydaze,AskReddit,1391027797.0,"I saw it really well explained in another comment thread, but here's the gist of it: they have potential to be so much more. Many issues that women face also have a negative impact on men, so if MRAs could work with the feminist movement, I'm sure some really great things for everyone could be achieved. 

Unfortunately, many MRAs seem to think its a 0 sum game - that for an increase in standards for one gender, there is necessarily a decrease for the other gender, 

So instead of working on ways of doing some great work in the real works (aside from spamming sexual assault forms so that real victims of sexual assault get ignored), it's mainly a lot of taking swipes at feminists trying to make the world a fairer place. 

Not to say that everyone in that sub is like that, it just seems to be the overriding messages coming out from there. "
honestbleeps,chicago,1391027801.0,"&gt; for a sub this size the amount of new content is pretty disappointing

we agree here. has it not occurred to you that the reason so little new content gets posted here is because so many articles, even if newsworthy, unique or interesting get downvoted into the negatives?

you seem to think we're moderating the shit out of this place.  almost everything that gets removed falls under the following categories:

- spam - TONS of spam.

- image macros

- contains personal information (e.g. ""Bob Smith at X address I found your wallet"")

- creepshots (e.g. pictures of strangers on the El that make them clearly identifiable.. sometimes to shame them, sometimes just.. because pictures...)

I'm half tempted to ask the other moderators if they'd mind if I shared a day's mod log with you all just because I'm sick of the pontifications of users like you who seem to imagine we're doing WAY more than we really are."
Nomad47,politics,1391027801.0,I am really sick of the GOP trying to regulate every ones sex life and reproductive choices. I don’t want the church or the state to have any say in who gets to have children or adopt them. We need some sort of universal bill of reproductive rights. I don’t approve of abortion as a means of birth control but I don’t think the GOP should ever be allowed to make that decision or influence it in any way. What’s next are they going to make people take a test to see if there Christian enough to adopt children. The Christian cults and the GOP have no place in the modern world we need to watch the GOP and make sure they don’t empower the corporations to institute genetic slavery. The future is coming and like it or not we need to have strong laws in place to protect our reproductive rights and prevent genetic engineering abuse.

All that said, I've found solace in the following: setting boundaries about when I'm willing to be in the same place at the same time with her and him (and sticking to them); asking him to keep their relationship details to himself (or talk to others about it); and reminding myself that it's not *my* relationship, so I need to let them carry on in whatever way works for them.

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391027837.0,"&gt; Why is it unfair to use a well documented example of the treatment of women in other countries to draw parallels to how similar attitudes still pervade in our culture?

A common tactic used in propaganda is to present ""well documented examples"" from one side while completely neglecting context and ignoring the other side's perspective.

Men and women in Saudi Arabia and other places in the middle east face a different set of socioeconomic and cultural pressures from the US ranging from gender gap (1.27 men per women) to incomes, classes, gov't, religion, etc. It's completely unfair to use a focused lens to find women's issues there and use it to play Oppression Olympics in the North American context.

The ""parallels"" often don't work. I can't and you won't even be able to complete the ""parallel""/comparison without understanding how ""virgin shaming"" works in Saudi Arabia and how it intersects with various other problems such as homophobia.

The problem is that feminists prefer to look at other countries from their gender politics perspective to *begin with*, not the holistic perspective needed.

&gt; Yeah, I agree with this, but maintain that intent matters a lot. One is about exerting control over someone else, and the other is not. I think it is worse if the intention of your behavior is to deter someone's behavior, versus if your behavior subsequently causes someone to deter the behavior, even if that was not your intention.

Then that is a fundamental difference in opinion and even philosophy between us. I don't guess other people's intentions. "

From what I gather you're worried that this will seem like a massive invite for all the self absorbed straight dudes to come to this subreddit and just take over with posts either bashing on people or trying to prove how open they think they are because they like lesbians too.

Those are some valid concerns, because it's probably happened before in other small subreddits that started to get popular. Reddit is generally populated by straight white guys in their 20's, and a lot of them are ignorant assholes. Not all of them though.

Still even with this thread, I'd say that things are pretty tame around here as far as the straight guy invasion is concerned, and I think we can thank the mods for that.

So after reading all this and the other responses in this thread, are your still as worried as when you first commented or have you changed your mind in any way?

When 'sisters' *were* interacting with 'prospects' they were not allowed to identify what sorority they were with. So the girls had no idea who they could possibly get a bid from. Panhel recruiting method was idiotic perfection.

IFC had a much more lax recruiting method. Yes there were events where every chapter was present, but most recruiting took place when prospects came to 'mixers'/'smokers', came to watch a game at the house, or a pick up football/basketball/soccer game. You actually meet and get to know who guys *really* are when you hang out in so many different environments ...it's much harder to keep a facade going for so long.

Except to Batman, since Parasite feeding off of him would be *lethal*.

Until Metallo comes back with upgrades. He does that a lot. And he can't be *too* heavy-handed, since there is a human mind inside all that machinery.

&gt;Somewhat off-topic, do you think Batman would be above buying out large portions of LexCorp stock when it tanks after Lex goes to jail? 

I don't think Lex would be going to jail as easily as you think. He is every bit as smart as Batman, and he knows how to make sure nothing concrete can get back to him. I don't think Batman could pin things on him as easily as you think he could.

&gt;More on topic, Luthor needs resources when you go to prison for a shit-ton of white collar crimes, they take your money/stock. Luthor wouldn't be the CEO of LexCorp anymore.

*Assuming* Lex got his company taken away from him, Luthor is smart enough that he wouldn't really need Lexcorp. He patents one or two inventions under assumed names, gets rich, and builds his suit that way. Or he uses his pull in the villain community to get back on his feet in a day. Either way, he's far too smart and influential to keep down for long."

thro_way,changemyview,1391028125.0,"I'm not arguing that people should conform to gender roles, I'm arguing that it's rational to encourage others to conform to these roles.  

If someone felt that the benefits of acting effeminately were enough to outweigh the social costs of acting that way, then I think it would be completely rational for them to act effeminately.  Imagine if, however, they had developed in such a way that they had no interest in acting effeminately.  They'd have all the benefits of acting how they want, but without the cost of social ostracism.  Imagine how much easier your life would be if your heterosexual façade wasn't a façade, and you legitimately enjoyed behaving that way.

If a kid who has no interest in sports can learn to enjoy them, that's of tremendous benefit to them.  Many people believe that the odds of a child placed in a competitive environment learning to enjoy competition outweigh the odds of that child suffering mental damage, so it becomes a rational decision to put the kid in that sort of environment.  You might weigh the odds differently, but understand that for people who don't, it's a rational decision.

I agree that it would be ideal if women prioritized intelligence over beauty, but I think you're misunderstanding where gender roles come from.  They're not some arbitrary standard imposed just for the sake of convention, they're the set of values we've found to provide the greatest benefit to people by maximizing their value to others.  And to change these roles, we'd have to change the fact that being beautiful is more beneficial to women than intellect.  Teaching women to prioritize intellect over beauty only becomes logical if others value intellect over beauty as well, and I don't think that's likely to happen."

Black is an intimidating colour and a colour associated with death and misery in the human mind. This is not a good start for diplomatic matters.

Red and blue are passionate colours, and are associated with strength and are not intimidating colours.

Let me set the scene. I learned to skate as a toddler until i was 4, when i moved to the Southern US from Toronto. 9 years later, i move back to Toronto and about 4 years after that, I get to gonads to try to play hockey. So this is my first time out skating with a stick. Since I'm with my family I figure we are just going to mess around, so the only piece of equipment I wear is a helmet with a cage on it and freshly sharpened skates. I do one shaky lap and I'm feeling good. I decide I want to try a hockey stop. So i skate with determination as hard as i can (not very hard) to center ice and i try to stop. I don't think i was going fast enough, or i caught an edge, or i hit an invisible wall, but i went down, face first onto the ice. right in front of my whole family, dead centre of the arena. So that was fun.

Another time, I'm skating with my dad. We're in the middle of a game and I decide i want to hit him. He's a bigger guy and he can skate. I go to lay him out, and he just stands there, and the next thing i know, I'm looking up at the lights. He's just smirking at me from above.

There is nothing preventing a developer from including interesting information about a culture or activity in a game, and there is nothing preventing a director from including such in their movie. In fact, video games have the potential to be exponentially more educational than a book or movie, because they allow the user to interact with it and learn at their own pace. Look at Kerbal Space Program, not only are you learning about physics and rockets from the game telling you how they work, but you are also learning by experimenting and creating.

onthefence928,DebateReligion,1391028286.0,"&gt;Floods are very temporary aren't they? Florida was underwater for thousands of years while the great flood (supposedly) only lasted 40 days and 40 nights. I know geology works on a very large scale, I don't think such a thing would form a layer significant enough to be observed when an inch of sediment has thousands of years of history behind it.

that much water moving that quickly would have been extremely energetic and we would find evidence of it. i dont mean we would expect the same layers as florida, but as an example of how we can determine the past with accuracy from the layers.

this is of course the least of the scientific problems with the flood

more can be found here: http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html#georecord

&gt;There is evidence, i.e. the stories from isolated cultures.
Cultures that constantly experience floods isn't indicative of a cross-cultural story with similar details.

again, the details arent as similar as you think or are outright contradictory. the mere existence of other cultures contradicts the flood because other cultures have histories that predate the flood, and continued uniterrupted, if teh flood had occured the chinese, the eqyptians, the mayans, etc. would have lost their pre-flood culture as they would have been wiped out and if humans spread out from noah's family to repopulate then the cultures would have restarted, and there would be a clear distinction between pre-flood and post-flood culture in each region. even the abrahamic region lack this feature"

thedancingman4321,BuildaCarAVForMe,1391028316.0,"Kenwood is a really good starter brand. I will recommend them any day over kicker. Matching the wattage of the subs and amps is important, but other than the quality of the amp, it doesn't matter what amp you use, and with sub amps in particular, the quality of the amp isn't as crucial when it comes down to how the subs sound. Its all about power.

Looking at the stock speakers online, the set in the thread should fit if they are 6x8 speakers.

Addressing some of the questions in the thread:

Deadening is very important in certain areas. If you have rattles, deaden. If you have road noise, deaden the doors. Deadening allows for the music in your car to be uninterrupted by outside forces. It also makes the car feel like a luxury car in some regards, as the primary difference between a cheap car and a luxury one is how much the car has been deadened. 

The power will be coming from the alternator primarily and battery a bit. You will need to up the wiring in the engine bay. When you have the system installed (by a shop I am guessing?) ask to have the big three done in your engine bay using 4 awg cca wiring (or 8 awg pure copper). 

For you, two amps might be the cheaper option. a 5 channel might be a cheaper option. I will look into it, but I would guess you will be using a sub amp in conjunction with a 4 channel (maybe a two).

One or two subs comes down to power and how loud you want to play. One sub is fine in most cases, but if you run a lot of power to your subs or want the system to be louder then you run two. Some people also prefer the astetic.

8s are generally punchy. 12s aren't as punchy nor are they as sloppy as say an 18"" sub. They are a good in between. Generally, the larger the sub the louder it is; it comes down to surface area of the sub. As for the people saying their 8's are loud, it is likely in a ported box that is tuned fairly high. Those same people will (generally) not be able to play low notes. IMO, 8s are acceptable if you are looking for some will on the low end, or want to have very punchy bass (primary reason why some people use 8"" subs as midbass drivers in conjunction with a 15 or 18"" sub), but the best all around sub is generally going to be your 12"".

If you buy a box, you will not need to tune it. You can modify the tuning, but you need to be comfortable with box building to do that.

I think it shouldn't. I know this isn't a very popular opinion right now on here, what with this /r/holocaust witch hunt going strong, but I think that the moment you start outlawing a certain belief or opinion you're turning unto a dangerous path. I'm not being an alarmist, saying that it leads to fascism, total censorship or some other BS. I'm just saying that once you cross that line of outlawing an opinion or belief you can't really pretend that you're still a supporter of freedom of speech. And what would then keep the admins, governments and so on, from banning speech that in their opinion is wrong/terrible/etc. It's a slippery slope.

She is right, you are disrespectful to her.

This may be silly to you but it is important to her. What if she had always wanted to be a lawyer and needed to move to be able to go to law school, would you support her?

Right, because that is something you value.

So the real challenge is, what happens when something is important to your wife and not to you? How do you react to it. Do you give it fair consideration, or dismiss it out of hand. And when she tries to get you to understand how much it means to her, do you listen respectfully? What if you had a dream? What if you could tell she didn't share it? How would you feel if she wouldn't even listen?

I know you are frustrated at work, but you are letting it bleed over into your home life, she doesn't deserve that.

If you can't even sit down with her and let her show you what she has with an open mind, and take that opportunity to ask questions and express concerns, and actually listen to what she says in return and consider it, perhaps you *should* move on, so she can find someone who is willing to at least listen to her dreams.

--

Reading some of your replies to other comments. It is clear that you are jealous of her being able to stay home. It sounds like you need to admit that and deal with it first. Then, determine what would have to change for you to be not be so frustrated. Perhaps it is time for her to at least get a part time job?

The ""parallel"" you're trying to draw is incomplete, because you are only going to present the female persecution perspective for ""slut shaming"". 

""Virgin shaming"" in Saudi Arabia is a separate matter, and I doubt you nor others including myself would give it justice, as we don't understand the social dynamics behind it and how it intersects with other issues such as homophobia.

&gt; I don't believe there is any ambiguity about the intention of slut shaming and virgin shaming, particular in the case of calling men virgin neckbeards. You're being disingenuous.

There is ambiguity.

Some people will ""slut shame"" not just to change the target's behaviour, but simply out of spite/bitterness for no purpose. 

Some others will ""slut shame"" for exactly your stated purpose.

Same with virgin shaming. Coming from parents, it may be pushing their kid to start considering marriage. Coming from a girl who has interest in the guy, it might be encouraging him to be more productive. Coming from a bully, it might just be to emotionally injure the victim."

Gluestick05,AskWomen,1391029150.0,"&gt; Refer to the occasion as a ""party,"" not a ""wedding,"" when booking services like catering, entertainment, and the reception venue. The word ""wedding"" magically inflates the price by about 20%, and strictly speaking the reception IS a party.

So...my advice is to only do this for goods, and not services.  Not only will you be working with your vendors a lot, but if you are deceptive about your event when you sign your contract, your vendor might take one look at you and your white dress and tell you to GTFO.  Even if they don't, the last thing you want is someone who is pissed off at you for lying as they are serving your guests' food, managing your event space, and deciding whether or not you will get your deposit back.

thro_way,changemyview,1391029316.0,"&gt;Hating people who have dark skin is racist, even though there are some non-white people who are born with paler skin, and some white people who are very very tan.

That's interesting.  While I agree that in practice someone who hates dark skin is almost certainly racist, I don't think it's inherently so.  If someone hated tan white people while having no problem with light skinned blacks, I wouldn't consider them racist, just a huge asshole.

&gt;Not hanging out with people you have nothing in common with is not gender policing.

I think that most people consider isolation a form of bullying.  Also, understand that in many social circles, ridiculing others yields social benefits for oneself.  Convincing others not to capitalize on the benefits of bullying others requires more action than letting things take their natural course.

&gt;Anyways, I think we just disagree. Totally isolating a guy with feminine traits from all society (or trying to force him to act more stereotypically masculine) only makes sense (in a sociopathically utilitarian way) if you believe that feminine traits are worthless or harmful to society.

It's not that they're worthless to society, but rather that they're worthless to society in men.  Similarly, masculine traits aren't worthless to society, they're just worthless in women.  I doubt you would consider that to be misandry."

y2ketchup,BSA,1391029325.0,"As an older brother I thought I'd share some of my thoughts reading your post.  I wasn't a particular bully however I certainly got physical on occasion with my bro.  I am a big guy and I can also be loud so I can imagine it may have been difficult to be my younger brother.  

I specifically remember a moment I college where the big brother in me just kinda grew up.  I thought about all the tough times I had caused for my bro, being physical, being mean, excluding him, embarrassing him.  I felt very guilty and literally broke down crying.

Since then my relationship with my bro has matured.  I think we both are able to remember the past fondly and move beyond any difficulties. 
Your brother knows he was/is a bully and he probably feels bad but he doesn't know how to change.  His ignoring you may be some kind of acknowledgement of this.  Give him space to change and try to move beyond the past, your future selves may be better off."

kiwirish,newzealand,1391029330.0,"Also, the argument that we're too similar to Australia is ridiculous. The reason we're mistaken is because Australia is bigger and more well known that us. Australia's flag uses white stars, there are more stars, and more points on each star to the point that they're not even close to being similar when only the top left corner is the same. 

And also, if we want to distance ourselves from colonialism, why is it so popular to change the flag but not ditch the Treaty? The Treaty is even more colonial and has been abused by both sides since inception, while also only stipulating a bicultural rather than multicultural New Zealand. We need a new constitution that is written upon principles for all New Zealanders, and not an unwritten plethora of documents that all overrule each other."
WinterCharm,Battlefield,1391029331.0,"Anyone who's even taken a basic Comp Sci course, or has any real experience with coding knows how much of a nightmare debugging can be :/ 

Think about that nightmare, and add to it a ton of API's, the entire game engine, and then all the 3D models, textures, etc. Then, add animations and add network components for multiplayer. Then, try supporting multiple platforms (Poor DICE is dealing with xbox 360, PS3, Xbox One, PS4, and PC). Oh, and throw in a physics engine, and bullet tracking/bullet counting/damage and health counting algorithms... 

A game like Battlefield 4 is IMMENSELY complex, and I think you and I totally understand that. At the same time, the vast majority of people do not. 

In the end, I like your idea about delaying it by 2-3 months. I don't know who's at fault here, but the game was clearly rushed out so that it was available BEFORE the holiday season. 

I think delaying it would have been the best option. Sure, you'd get some complainers either way (""why do we have to wait? blah blah"") but when the game came out, people would get to enjoy it from day one, in a playable state with minimal crashing. "

iheartennui,changemyview,1391029405.0,"&gt; Philosophers could also just read about scientific findings on their own.

They sure could and likely should. They seem to prefer doing research within the narrative of their own field though, much like physicists have a narrative of their own that they tend to stay within. This is kind of how academia works, unfortunately.

As to your question: The idea behind free will is that we, as agents living within the universe, should be able to effect our future trajectories. That is to say, if I want to pick up the apple instead of the orange, then I do so. This is the definition that I am going with anyway.

The problem is as follows: even though I feel like I decided to pick up the apple, and thus had a choice and could have easily decided the orange (i.e. freewill), the fact remains that if you believe in a deterministic universe, whether one decides on apple or orange was also predetermined, unbeknownst to you. So when you say
&gt; the ""free will"" still decides
you're neglecting the fact that the state of the deterministic universe at the instant that this decision is made has been determined by every instant leading up to that point, due to the deterministic physical laws. So the so-called ""free will"" had no choice in what decision they make.

That said, there are people who believe that free will and determinism are compatible (""compatibalists""), as suggested in the great-great-grandparent of your comment, though I don't know their argument.

GlassArrow,AskReddit,1391029441.0,"It's more than likely a simulation according to Nick Bostrum's Simulation Argument.  
""A technologically mature ""posthuman"" civilization would have enormous computing power. Based on this empirical fact, the simulation argument shows that at least one of the following propositions is true:
The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;
The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;
The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.
If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one’s credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).
Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."""

Would this not set the stage for an even greater income inequality and ultimately reduce the effectiveness of the basic income so that those earning it are deeply impoverished?

People can often afford things like food and housing due to welfare today, yet these things do not happen. Since basic income would replace welfare, the effects should be largely unchanged because demand will not change that much.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1391029727.0,"It is just literally true that people do not always mean what they say or say what they mean.

The phrase ""No means no"" is helpful to women because it sets a hard line. This hard line buys time. Time for her to think. 

It is sometimes true that such a hard line turns out not to be necessary. Sometimes she IS okay to go through with it after having said no, after the situation has been changed somehow to make her  more comfortable, or something has been made clear, or she has gotten to go pee and triple checked that she's properly wiped before her asshole is on display, or any number of things.

In some ways I do think it would be good for everyone if women (myself included) practiced using a wider vocabulary in these instances. Because I don't envy the responsibility put on men, in their position of power in these intimate instances, to have to pull their head out of lust and try to figure out what is going on.

It is true that ""No"" is used in different ways, even though it is the same word:

* No = Not ever with you
* No = I do not want to have sex with anyone right now
* No = I'm not ready to have sex yet with anyone
* No = I'm not ready yet to have sex with you
* No = I like you, but don't really feel like having sex right now
* No = I haven't shaved my legs in like two weeks and even if you end up not caring, it'll be all I can think about the whole time
* No = I'd like to, but I'm way too gassy after that huge meal you just fed me and the pressure of your cock into me will make me fart all over you, so I have to pass right now
* No = Something just doesn't feel right to me, but I don't know what it is
* No = I don't know why I want to do this right now, and that makes me really nervous, this could be a bad decision
* No = I'm not excited enough to be comfortable doing this
* No = You're hot as hell, but something about the way this is progressing feels off, Fuck I want to, but there's a red flag of some kind going up right now
* No = I am not comfortable initiating and need you to continue to pursue me so that I can feel small and like I'm just going with the flow *this particularly grates me personally, I feel like women who do this need to either discuss CNC ahead of time, or work on their own comfort with sex first, and men need to, for their own protection, not just let this slide*
* No = CNC: be a little more aggressive, I like you so big and me so small
* No = CNC: tear me to pieces you fuck, bring it on

.
.
.

*(I don't know if I didn't do enough or had way too much fun with it)*

As much as I am ALL for **people using their actual fucking words to say what they actually fucking think and feel and not make the other person try to pick it out of their heads when they can't even themselves fully express it,**

alas, I think it is not to be in many of these situations.

And that's because people don't think clearly when they are horny, or scared, or nervous. Emotions can be overwhelming in such a way that identifying the right feeling can be really hard to do, let alone put it into words, and words that the other person will understand.

But ""No"" ah, ""No"" is right there. It has been sitting on the tip of my tongue since I learned it as a toddler.

""No"" is accessible to me in ways many other words are not. 

""No means no"" gives me permission to use this word *without being  required* to pick apart why I need it. Sometimes that means copping out of a personal gross body function I don't want to have to explain. Sometimes it offers a small bit of protection if I think the situation unsafe: I don't *have to* tell this guy that outweighs me by 100 lb that after trying to give him a shot, it turns out I'm not attracted to him specifically. 

Even though ""no means no"" isn't literally always ""no not ever"" I think we need ""no means no."" 

**Unless** we can get to a point where everyone has sit-down discussions about sex before they engage. Which I would love. But apparently that is a real difficulty for many.

In the heat of the moment **No has to mean No.**  Not just ""stop."" 
Not just, ""okay now that you are aroused and probably going to be annoyed that I need to cut this off make me explain to you why while I pray you aren't someone with a temper or going to persuade me that my reasons are stupid.""

But ""No.""

What I'm saying is that if someone were to spend 1 hour playing a flight simulator and 1 hour reading a book on how to fly planes (assuming they were both optimally made), they would likely learn **much** more from the game, because they are interacting as well as receiving information from the game instead of just receiving information from the book.

sw1n3flu,AskReddit,1391029798.0,"You are talking about the amount of books and movies, that is an unfair comparison because video games have not been around nearly as long as either, and even then they were very limited in what they could do until recently. The relative lack of content in video games in comparison to books/movies is not a fault of the medium, and in 20 years they could have as much or more information than the others as they become more accessible (as phones become more simple and powerful). What I'm saying is that if someone were to spend 1 hour playing a flight simulator and 1 hour reading a book on how to fly planes (assuming they were both optimally made), they would likely learn **much** more from the game, because they are interacting as well as receiving information from the game instead of just receiving information from the book."

Cygnus_X,Bitcoin,1391029954.0,"I didn't like the way mining was explained in the podcast, so I want to throw my own spin on it (the rest of it was beautiful Andreas if you are reading this).

Two of the difficulties with Bitcoin were in finding a way to distribute the currency while also convincing users to contribute processing power to the network.  We need users to contribute processing power because it makes the network resistant to malicious attack, but contributing this power can be expensive.  So, how does Bitcoin go about this?

Bitcoin essentially forms an army just like any other leader throughout history.  The participants in this particular army are called miners.  Miners lend processing power to the network to verify transactions and also fight off spam and other types of attacks on the network.  And just like all the armies before them, each miner is rewarded for their contribution.  The spoils of war if you will.  This reward varies proportionately to how much processing power they contribute.  This is what gives incentive to kids to set up water cooled data centers in their mom's basement.  This is how Bitcoin distributes the currency and how the network defends itself against attack.

Now, many times you will hear that Bitcoin miners solve puzzles.  This sounds confusing, but the reason this is necessary is to prove how much power they are contributing to the network.  If you can solve a difficult puzzle quickly, then it proves you are lending the network a lot of processing power.  It is also important to note here that the test for how much power you are lending the network has a double purpose in that it also serves to verify transactions.  For computer programmers, this puzzle is to add a random number to the input string of a hash function such that the output is less than a certain precalculated value.  There is no way in predicting the hash output, so many random numbers must be chosen until this equation can be satisfied.  Solving this equation is the last step in verifying a transaction and results in a monetary reward.  For those who know math but are not familiar with hash functions, imagine trying to solve the equation 2^x / 3 = any value with a remainder of 1.  We can quickly guess that one answer is x = 2 because 2^2 / 3 = 1, with a remainder of 1.  However, try to solve 2^x / 7 = a value with a remainder of 1 and let me know how long it takes to figure out.  Now try mod(2^x / 47) = 1.  It is very easy to increase the difficulty of solving this equation with very little effort, and the ability to solve large problems simultaneously verifies transactions and proves you are contributing significant computing power.

The seller got the item back and then sent me an email outside of our ebay conversation and accused me of sending back a product they didn't sell. I was originally asking for the item I ordered but after that I asked for a refund and the seller flipped out and called me a liar and a scammer. Good times. Great way to treat a customer.

But he has GOT to be the lawn mower.  I hate mowing the damn lawn.

What I look for in an emotional dynamic is hard to describe.  I have issues with anxiety, so I really can't be the ""strong"" one all the time.  I can put my anxiety on the back burner and be strong for someone temporarily - if they're having a bad day, or if a tragedy occurs and they need a shoulder for longer - but it can't be a permanent part of the dynamic.  I had to break up with a guy because I felt like I had to be ""the guy"" in the relationship because he was so sensitive, and it was exhausting/a turnoff.  I have submissive tendencies in and out of the bedroom - not to the point where I want a purely dom/sub relationship, but I find having someone who can call the shots with my best interest at heart very relaxing.  That being said, I still have ultimate say in what I do with my life.

Midgetgirl05,AskReddit,1391030289.0,"There are diseases that do pass via reproduction (of sorts) in dogs. 

The two that come to mind for me are Brucellosis, which causes spontaneous abortions, stillborns, and other issues in females in the last trimester, and Canine Transmissible Venereal Tumors. Both of which are transmissible via close contact or during copulation. 

Dogs go into what is referred to as ""heat"" cycles, so in a way they get periods. They can breed as soon as they are 6 months of age, which is why Veterinarians stress the importance of spaying/neutering them at that age or as early as 5 months. 

They can have heat cycles all through the year, so they can have pups at any time, unlike other animals who may only go into heat during certain seasons.

Hovsky,Firearms,1391030296.0,"&gt;Car accidents and assaults are an order of magnitude apart, not the same order of magnitude.

This seems to be the most common complaint. I worded that really poorly. I meant ''about the same order of magnitude'' as ''not several.'' Yeah, it's definitely not the same one. After that I went on to list a few circumstances that bring the two probabilities much closer, however.

&gt;200 million people go to the beach, but the total amount of exposed time is significantly less than the total time those people are potentially exposed to assault.

True. This only makes the gap larger, however.

&gt;That said, I love the post.

Glad to hear it.

&gt;And people probably spend more time exposed to car accidents than assaults, although I'm not sure how to quantify that.

I'd say it probably depends on how you define ''exposed.''"

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391030496.0,"&gt; Notice how I used the word often. Of course there are times when someone just calls someone else a slut, with no regard to how that will affect their behavior. They're just trying to be insulting. That does not change the fact that in many instances slut shaming is an attempt to exert control over a woman's behavior. I am not trying to argue that everytime the word slut is uttered it is an attempt to control a woman's behavior, rather that it is often the intention. Again, virgin shaming a man, especially when it comes to calling a man a virgin neckbeard, virtually never has that intention. It is just meant to be insulting.

So your clarification is over relative frequency of each intent. That *usually* slut shaming is about controlling behaviour, and *usually* virgin shaming doesn't have an intent to control behaviour... at least not as often as slut shaming.

Fair enough if that's just an opinion. It's unfalsifiable and meaningless to me though. As I said before, it's a conflict between philosophies. I prefer not assuming intent."
sunshinerf,AskWomen,1391030497.0,"I have actually just started my online dating experience 2 weeks ago, and I must admit, it's quite a ride. I work a lot, don't go out much and really want to meet a nice guy I have something in common with. So I followed a friend's advice and joined match.com .

Here's my two cents on the experience: Obviously, you never know who online is actually the person their profile claims them to be, and it is scary. 

There are plenty of creeps and odd messages. Men bluntly ignore what I put as my requirements in a partner yet write to me that they think we have a lot in common... In less than 48 hours on the site I got over 60 messages from different men and it was quite overwhelming! 

When you join a dating site you jump into a very deep pond and you are bound to find more than one good fish. This is where my main problem comes into play; how do you juggle all this? I am not a serial dater, I think it is awkward to be dating more than one person at a time and it is also very confusing! So what do I do?


It is also impossible to determine chemistry, because when you meet someone in person you can feel it pretty much right away, but emails take away from that feeling. You can't be sure if in person this guy would actually be interesting or attractive. It's a weird feeling.

So I decide to give one guy a chance, and it's going pretty well but there is another guy and I don't want to keep him on standby until I decide whether or not it is working out with the first guy. So what do I do? I have no idea!

Now I find myself with second thought about this experience because it doesn't feel like it's natural and things just fall into place. It feels like I am forcing it and it's kind of like rush hour traffic; There are too many cars coming in the same direction at the same time  and driving on the fwy just sucks.

I hope this makes sense.

tl;dr Online dating can get creepy but is mostly confusing, to me."

People might fight about video games, sports teams, whatever -ism offends them that day, whatever. But at the end of the day with other types of drama, 99% of the people involved have no real, tangible stake in it. One half of the people involved in every bit of BTC drama have a tangible, monetary stake in the fate of BTC, so they're 100x more invested in their argument than a normal person in any other argument. Can you imagine how much more vicious people would be if they stood to make a (sometimes pretty large) profit or a substantial loss by persuading people that 'X' opinion they hold is right?

blue_eyes13,nursing,1391030575.0,"Thanks for replying. Yeah a lot of the things you've mentioned are reasons I posted this and didn't just go right ahead and apply. I'm worried that I've only been a nurse for 6 months, but I did work in labor pool full time at a hospital during nursing school and floated to all the different units including ED and ICU- while I don't have experience for 3 years as an RN it is clinical experience technically ( I guess). 

Another big motivator is that I am miserable at my current job. Other employees are miserable. It's just a bummer going to work every day and as much as I'd like to try to convince myself that that is ok- it's just not acceptable for me. Like you mentioned though, I would prefer not to leave on bad terms and mess up my references. The hospital I am applying to however has a very good reputation for treating their employees well, it is affiliated with a well renowned college that has an ADN to BSN program (which I need and my current hospital doesn't offer), plus it is an ICU position and a coronary ICU on top of that! 

Thanks for your input- and everyone else too- it's helped me to be able to talk through this and get different perspectives."

Based off my friend's experience, the unofficial hazing still really sucks, you have to give so much of your free time to it (with my major, this would probably make me fail as I had to work as well), and she put a LOT of money in to it.  Not just in dues, but you end up buying a lot of things for your bigs, littles, for yourself (clothing mostly, with your letters on it...), money for traveling to events, money for events (imagine a wedding reception caliber dinner party, complete with open bar)....etc.  Now...my friend LOVED it.  She has always had an easy come easy go attitude with her finances and is ok with the prices and time it requires.  She loves the friends she made.

But no way I could do that and be happy. Also I do feel like she's changed since joining it.  I don't blame college for that cuz she only joined for her last 2 years, and that's when she changed.

slockley,AskReddit,1391030618.0,"I think that people rarely assert things they don't believe in for karma, but rather, those that are swayed by karma and who also hold reddit-popular beliefs speak increasingly often.  To contrast, karma-sensitive people with reddit-unpopular beliefs tend toward silence.  This gives the appearance that typical viewpoints sway toward popular ones, but I suspect this is not the case.

The same effect occurs in real life.  Consider the movement toward cultural acceptance of gay marriage.  Have millions of people changed their mind in the last few years?  Or have those that hold the increasingly popular belief spoken up, and the traditionalists been marginalized?  Blind polls show a very slight majority of Americans support gay marriage, but popular media would portray a near unanimous consensus.

I suspect that phenomenon is at play in Reddit as well."

SpaZticHero,SquaredCircle,1391030624.0,"In Season 3 of the excellent TV show, Community (Seriously... [Go watch it](http://www.hulu.com/community)), there is an episode called [""Remedial Chaos Theory""](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remedial_Chaos_Theory). In the episode they order pizza and sit down to play a game of Yahtzee, but when the door bell rings no one wants to go collect the pizza.

Group leader, Jeff Winger suggests rolling the dice to decide who will go and collect it but before he does, group member, Abed Nadir informs him that in doing so he is now creating 6 different potential timelines. The rest of the episode is dedicated to [playing out the potential events of each possible timeline](http://youtu.be/JTsb5hg04Oc), one of which is causes one group member to be shot, another to have a guy driven mental breakdown, another turn to alcoholism and two different members losing two different body parts. Due to these events, the now distraught survivors of these event accept that they are in the ""Darkest Timeline"", and divulge all their time to evil by growing black goatees (or wearing ones made out of black felt) and trying to find a way to claim the best possible timeline for themselves.

What dies this have to do with WWE? Well... Due to the event of the Royal Rumble and general fan out rage, [one WWE fan brought a sign to Raw this past Monday declaring that we are currently part of the darkest timeline](http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/1wclam/spotted_at_tonights_raw_xpost_from_rcommunity/).

All he's doing is using Buddhism as a bludgeon, and incorrectly at that.  ""Feelings aren't real"" isn't a thing that I have ever heard.  I have heard people comment that ""feelings aren't facts"" and they aren't.  Even in this, he is using it incorrectly.  It's intent is twofold.  First, in order to practice dissociation of yourself from your feelings; second, in order to magnify the impermanent nature of emotions.

Like any other religion (I still to this day have a MAJOR trigger with regard to organized religion) there are people that take it to a bad place, and people that take it to a good place.  Are you using it to unite people, or to drive a wedge between them?  Basically he seems like a garden variety narcissist wielding eastern proverbs.

I have a couple of things for you...  One, I feel awful for what you went through.  Your feelings are yours and they are valid, period.  Second, and I may get shouted down for this, but I would encourage you to give Buddhism a look over.  I am by no means trying to convert you here, I don't get a commission.  Studying it and its precepts might bring you into some understanding of what it's really about, and why it's important.  Perhaps read a book, I really like Buddha Zen Tao Tantra by Osho.

Maybe separating Buddhism from your father can help it to be less of a trigger for you."
Hovsky,Firearms,1391030851.0,"&gt;While my original comment was not meant to say that they were mathematically equal, it was meant to say that they aren't worth worrying about in my life time.

You have a very different opinion on ''not worth worrying about'' than I do. Over a lifetime (past 18) I have a 25% chance of being a victim of violent crime. I think that's significant.

&gt;So, no, they are not ""about the same order of magnitude"".

Admittedly shitty wording. I meant not several, which is obviously not what I wrote. However, you seem to have skipped the next section where I list several reasons that bring the probabilities closer. The car accident value is a max estimate, and the violent crime value is a low estimate.

&gt;On top of all that, the risks of violent death in the home increase[1] if you own a gun.

Not to an extent where it's worth worrying about, by your own logic. However, that statistic is meaningless to *me* as it is a preventable thing, unlike being assaulted or hit by another car (within reason). Firearm accidents in your own home happen if you are negligent.

Also, I'm surprised/impressed you saw this post."

Of course, one should always be wary of interpretation - he mentions that in the first drafts Thorin was the great-uncle of Fili and Kili and then they were brought a generation closer, ""so he was sure he wanted that close relationship."" Speaking as a (wannabe) writer, Tolkien could also have realised that would make Thorin too old, or that he had one generation that lounged about doing nothing, or a million other things ; not that he particularly cared about the line of Durin being close and all.  

But it's bloody amazing to see how far is Richard prepared to go with his work. It would *never* occur to me to trace back all the way to scrap-bin for an insight into someone's ideas.

And that bit about Thorin being the darer while Thain was the yearner? Geez.

Hovsky,CCW,1391030994.0,"&gt;Regarding your Glock, the bore won't be that visibly different even after a great deal of firing. A more reliable way to judge how many rounds have been through it would be to look for smiling on the barrel. If you're not familiar with the term, just rack back the slide and look at the barrel. With any significant amount of firing, you'll see a ""smile"" shape of the finish worn off the barrel from where it contacts the slide on cycling. The more pronounced the smile and the wear, the more rounds fired. With 50, you should hardly see anything, maybe something more akin to scuffing. The top surface of the locking block and the top front of the breech block are also quick and easy places to check for Glock wear.

Oh, yeah, excellent point. Sorry, I didn't mean bore, I meant the entire barrel. I also field stripped it and checked for wear and dirt on the inside, etc. All of it combined looked pristine."

ChangloriousBastard,AskReddit,1391031098.0,"&gt; And what happened is I incited many a hateful and assholish replies. Received many a downvote and lured into many arguments. I hated that shit.

I had to abandon my old account because of this.  I was active in a few subreddits that (at the time) were fairly small.  People who saw me often and disagreed with me on unrelated topics would incite things just because they recognized me and felt that we had some sort of beef.  

Whereas anonymity used to allow the Reddit community to be open and explore ideas that may not have gained traction otherwise, it eventually turned into a tool that allowed assholes to be assholes publicly.  

I used to post things because I felt they added to the conversation in some sort of meaningful way.  I still try to do that, but I feel like I have to censor myself in two ways:

1.) Everything I post must be done with the expectation that someone will hate it and escalate it to some dangerous level.  My old username could easily be traced back to my real identity, which is why I was so disturbed by all of the people taking arguments too far.  Though it hadn't happened, I didn't want to turn into a story about the Reddit Pitchfork Army going too far.  I think protecting your identity online is important, but I feel that complete anonymity reduces credibility.  

2.) I have to frame my argument in a way that is as diplomatic as it can be.  If you leave yourself open to flaming, you'll get flamed.  I feel like this self censorship is the most dangerous, as I'm often writing to the lowest common denominator.  

I guess Reddit has turned from a friendly group discussion to an angry town hall.  I'm not that upset about it, but it certainly makes the experience less enjoyable.

boolean_sledgehammer,AskMen,1391031213.0,"Texas has a fairly rich history producing some badass dudes. However, it's hard to compete with one of the [first European explorers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvar_N%C3%BA%C3%B1ez_Cabeza_de_Vaca) who inadvertently ended up exploring a good chunk my home state. 

Granted, was from Spain, but he's often cited as a pretty important figure in Texas history. When you read about what he did, you can begin to understand why.

From [here:](http://www.austinpost.org/article/toughest-man-ever-lived-texans-remember-cabeza-de-vaca)

* In June 1527, at the age of 40, Cabeza de Vaca left Spain for the Caribbean as second-in-command of a group of five ships with six hundred sailors. His captain was a man named Narvaez.

* They overwintered 1527-1528 on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (now Cuba). While there, they suffered a devastating hurricane and the desertion of 140 or so men. 

* After refitting following the hurricane, in April 1528 five ships and 400 men sailed from Cuba to the western coast of Florida, near what is now Tampa.

* Narvaez then decided to send 300 men, himself and Cabeza de Vaca among them, inland to find gold and a site for settlement. The ships were to go ahead and meet them at another point on the coast. This was a huge mistake. The ships got hopelessly separated from the men inland, who were now on their own. 

* The inland men reached Northwestern Florida in mid-June and camped for three months, facing food shortages and unfriendly Indians.

* They returned to the Florida coast and now, driven by desperation, they built five boats of rough-sawn timber caulked with pine resin, made sails from their own clothes, and slaughtered their horses, whose hides covered the boats and whose hair made rigging for the sails.

* Leaving Florida in September 1528, five boats and 250 men attempted to sail along the Gulf Coast west to Mexico. Things were okay for awhile but then storms separated the five boats (of course) and two of them were swept up onto a small island just west of Galveston Island (most likely, that is ... this is not known for sure). One of these two boats had Cabeza de Vaca on it. They were soon found by Karankawas who turned out to be friendly and who gave them food and water. By this time, all of the men were very nearly dead. But Cabeza de Vaca and his men got healthy and decided to launch the boat again. It capsized and three men drowned. The survivors washed up on the beach as naked as the day they were born and presented such a pitiful sight that the Karankawas cried with them for half an hour.

* The two groups of survivors found each other on the island and chose the four strongest men to walk westward along the coast to Mexico to send help. The men disappared forever, of course, and no help ever came.

* Cabeza de Vaca survived the winter of 1528-1529 but in the spring he went onto the Texas mainland and became so sick that, believing him to be very near death, all but two of his companions left him, deciding to travel south and west down the coast towards Mexico.

* After they left, amazingly, Cabeza De Vaca recovered. He spent the next four years with his two remaining Spanish companions, using the island as his home base.

* During these four years, Cabeza de Vaca was a merchant, a doctor, and a slave. The Karankawas demanded that he treat their sick. For almost a year he was forced to live with other Indians, who treated him like a slave. Later he escaped and lived the life of a trader, trading coastal products like shells and snails for hides, red ocher, flint etc...

* In late 1532 one of his Spanish companions died. He convinced the other that they needed to walk to Mexico. Traveling westward, they met some Indians who told them of a group of three other men like them who were being held as slaves by another tribe. To show what was happening to the men, the Indians slapped and beat Cabeza de Vaca and his companion. This frightened his companion so badly that he returned to the Galveston area and disappeared forever.

* So now Cabeza De Vaca was on his own. A few days later, he found the three other men: Maldonado, Carranza and Estevancio. They escaped their captors and, together, these four men would continue their adventure FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS.

* They were then captured and made slaves by the Coahuiltecan Indians. They immediately planned an escape but were unable to do it for about two years.

* Finally, in September 1534, they did escape and headed South. Nobody knows exactly where they went, but it appears that they walked through the desert for about 2,000 MILES. They probably walked through South Texas to Monterrey, Mexico, then to the northwest back into Texas across the Rio Grande south of El Paso near Presidio, and finally West across the Rio Grande to the outpost of Culiacan near the Pacific Ocean.

* They walked into Culican early in 1536, 8 1/2 years after Cabeza De Vaca had left Spain, having traveled two thousand miles in less than two years, killing whatever they could more or less with their bare hands, eating desert plants etc...

* Cabeza de Vaca reached Mexico City in July, 1536 and sailed back to Spain.

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1391031230.0,"The child *is* abandoned by the non-custodial parent... if all they do is put a check in the mail. Believe it or not, paying child support entitles you to certain parental rights, if you're not a complete asshole. Most states require that the custodial parent file charges or a restraining order if they don't want any contact with the biological non-custodial parent. So that's totally the prerogative of the non-custodial parent, whether or not they exercise their rights. Kids have a right to a standard of living, and biological parents have a right to be a parent to their children unless a compelling reason is established. So if the non-custodial parent only financially supports their children, they're simply failing to exercise parental rights they're entitled to by law. Which is why the state does not authorize direct payment to the custodial parent on behalf of the non-custodial parent, because they retain rights *and* it's not financially viable on a societal level. Additionally, many non-custodial parents do elect to be a part of their child's life at birth, and then reign in on their promises later (I talked about this briefly yesterday in the thread about growing up poor and on welfare, and how I saw Baby Daddies rotate in and out of some women's lives). Electing to accept parental responsibility and then changing your mind later does not require a political regime change to make life comfortable for irresponsible and selfish decisions.

Additionally, a lot of non-custodial parents that are incarcerated, extremely poor, or can prove compelling reason why they can't pay are not required to pay. And that's only if the custodial parent sues for additional support or unpaid support. Most states do not automatically prosecute child support dodgers, and custodial parents often have to file costly paperwork and show up to court. Payment is most often voluntarily, only resulting in garnishing of wages when the delinquency is particularly willful -- but only if the custodial parent actively pursues it. It's pretty common that custodial parents, busy being single and poor -- do not pursue it.

I've seen the metrics for how the payments are determined in each state. You can Google them if you wish. So your ""too high"" is just an opinion, or anecdotal rubbish by people extremely ignorant of what the minimum is. They're very low, and only high if the non-custodial parent has no physical custody (i.e. spends no money on being a parent in the normal course of the day) and makes quite a bit of money. In which case, they're never equal to the amount of and portion of income undoubtedly dedicated to child-rearing by the custodial parent.

You're making the same mistake again: confusing ""providing a lifestyle"" with the normal course of child-rearing. Alimony and spousal support is for the provision of a lifestyle of your ex. Child support is for the maintenance of your biological children.

And the reason that non-custodial parents have to do it is because it's *their* children. Most of them get a pretty good deal: low minimum payments, and all the warm fuzzies of being a parent without cleaning up puke or driving junior to daycare every morning. It's parenthood for lazy people, basically. You fail to consider how the alternatives are worse, and how much higher the burden is on the custodial parent.

The only apparent consideration in your calculus is the comfort of someone who has biological children, yet seems to have zero concern for their well-being. I'm sorry, but nobody's in the business of making political policies for the comfort of selfish fucks."

i'm guessing you're more after how children themselves empathize?

in many situations they simply cannot.  [pre-puberty, the human brain isn't physically developed enough for cognitive empathy to occur in children the way it does in adults.](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304561004579137514122387446)

this is why a child's sense of self can be so damaged by poor parenting.  children do not understand that other people behave in ways that have nothing to do with themselves.  this is a key component for engaging in empathy-- one needs to understand that the self is separate from others in order to accept others' choices as entirely valid independent of one's own knowledge, emotions, values and interests."

woodwife,Libraries,1391031569.0,"I don't think anyone, homeless or billionaire, should be allowed to sleep or ""do whatever they want"" in the library. We have a pretty good number of homeless patrons at our library, partly because we're in walking distance of the shelter, and much like any other group they run the gamut between unpleasant and wonderful. Some of them turn up drunk and need to be asked to leave, but some of them are regulars who always say hi and make me smile. We ask everyone to abide by some common sense rules, and for the most part it works out very well.

I do absolutely think that the library should be a safe place for them, as it should be for children, the elderly, and everyone else. I also think it's great when people use it as a hangout spot - whether teens gabbing in their corner, friends having a coffee in our tiny cafe area (ie the one spot they're allowed food and drink), or college students working on a group project. We have regular meetings for knitting groups and mah jong players, and they're pretty much using the libary as a space to hang out. We consider ourselves a community center as well as a place to come for information, research, and pleasure reading.

ChangloriousBastard,AskReddit,1391031599.0,"I think you're overstating the ""Liberal-Echo-Chamber"" aspect of Reddit.  Prevailing political opinion has gone through many phases, at least from what I can tell.  

When I first started, Reddit was divided fairly evenly between Libertarians on the right and some strong leftists. Neither groups were particularly radical, and most conversation was civil and well supported.  

As it grew in popularity, Liberals did become the majority.  It still wasn't the MSNBC brand of liberalism, but it was definitely oriented more towards ideas of socialism, economic equality, and personal freedom.  I think this was in large part because Bush was in office.  

More recently, Reddit has become radicalized and overly partisan. Not in the sense that people had differing opinions, but people became to identify more with symbols than with ideas, concepts and logic.  It became left vs. right for the sake of fighting and argument.  We had low intelligence Ron Paul supporters fighting against an MSNBC think tank.  And I don't mean that in a nice way. 

Now I think that the prevailing political opinion on Reddit isn't liberalism or even conservatism.  It's cynicism.  People hate anything and everything remotely connected with politics or politicians.  "

justgivingsomeadvice,nba,1391031605.0,"I've thought about it, and concluded his only true MVP-contending years were 2003, 2006-2008. 2003 Duncan and 2003 Kobe played pretty much equally as well, but the (often Shaq-less) Lakers only won 50, whereas the Spurs won 61. Also, T-Mac had a PER of **30** and averaged 32-6.5-5.5, though his team only won 42. I'm not sure you could argue Kobe definitively deserved that one.

2006 you have no complaint from me. 2007, Kobe and Dirk's numbers were really similar. The talented Mavs ended with 67 wins where the Lakers only won 42. It's hard to argue Kobe deserved it over Dirk, though. The Lakers would have had to win maybe 55 games with that untalented roster for it to happen (interestingly enough, through 38-39 games Lakers were on pace for 54-55 wins!).

Then 2008 he won.

I would agree in a vacuum that a player of Kobe's caliber deserved more than 1 MVP, but unfortunately often when he was in his prime, he was either still the 2nd best player on his team ('03 and '04 with Shaq), on a really shitty team ('05 - '07), or dealing with LBJ playing his best ball statistically ever ('09).

mmp31,politics,1391031624.0,"&gt;i don't know if you realize that a min wage increase will have no affect on salaried workers. i would say 95ish% of jobs pay based on supply/demand of labor. the rest are at or around min wage and will fluctuate as min wage does.

I disagree.  Suppose Bob is making $10.88/hour.  The price of his labor is a signal that says his labor is worth 1.5 times that of somebody making $7.15/hr minimum wage.  If minimum wage gets raised to $10.88/hr, you have minimum wage workers making the same amount Bob, which now do not reflect how much Bob's labor is really worth according to the laws of supply and demand.  So eventually Bob's wages are going to adjust upward to about $16.31/hr, because that's how much his labor is really worth compared to a minimum wage job.  The same thing will happen for somebody who was making $16.31/hr before, and so on.  

The relative labor values of the workers will be the same in the end. Someone who's labor is worth 1.5 times a minimum wage job will end up making 1.5 times whatever minimum wage is. The only thing that's changing is the nominal amount of dollars they are being paid. The only reason Bob is making the same amount as someone on minimum wage is because increasing the minimum wage has distorted the pricing structure that tells us that Bob's labor is worth 1.5 times a minimum wage job.  Eventually (hopefully) the market corrects itself and Bob will make around $16.31/hr.

&gt;my bad, i misread your statement about inflation increases. but thats exactly the point that min wage needs to keep up with inflation b/c small decreases in poor people's real income have drastic effects. i would say an adjustment every 1-3 yrs for inflation would be necessary

So what happens if you have 14% inflation per year like we did in the early 1980s?  That means the poor and unemployed will see a decrease in their income of 48% over those three years.  Not a viable solution."

The last one, i stopped a bully from harassing a friend during a class.  This bully had a badass reputation for putting another kid in the hospital by bruising his kidney or something like that.  Anyway, he was kicking my friends desk over and over again while he was trying to write, so i made eye contact with him and positioned my leg such that it would stop the disruption.  After class let out the kid tried to jump me from behind in the crowded hall and punch me in the kidney.  It didn't really hurt.  I was more surprised than anything that he was punching me, and I just kind of turned and smirked at him.  His buddies were with him, and I think he was so embarrassed in front of them that his attack didn't really have an effect that he completely just turned and left.  He never bothered either of us again after that.

Wuffles70,fatlogic,1391031828.0,"I don't think she hit the jackpot genetically but I think other factors can definitely have a significant effect, too.

My friend actually got **really** screwed when she was little on the weight front - she comes from a big family but her mother is absolutely amazing. To give a bit of background, Mum came from a big Italian American family, which very heavily associated food and love so food was always complicated for her. Because she spent the 70s succumbing all the emerging faddy diets (and, from the sound of it, being shoved into it by a fair few insensitive family members), her health was pretty screwed up by the time the scientific evidence started coming to light and showing just how bad those things are for you. The worst part was when she drank a lot of diet coke whilst pregnant with my friend's big brother, not realising how terrible that is for you... and ended up diagnosed with crippling arthritis in her early 20s. She could barely walk, let alone go jogging or anything like that and has pretty much come to the conclusion that her options are live on a heavily calorie-controlled diet for the rest of her life or just enjoy her food and accept that it'll harm her long term. It's really sad and she was absolutely determined that my friend would **never** have to struggle like she did so, when my friend was a baby Mum made sure she didn't even know what sweets and chocolate **were** - her treats were pieces of fruit and everyone worked really hard at building up positive associations with healthy foods so that she'd stand the best chance possible of not ending up obese as an adult. Like I said, amazing family and they really did their best.

Cue her crazy nanny. When her mum went back to work, my friend (then 2-3 years old) got this nanny who intially came off as kind of kooky but towards the end was pretty evidently mentally ill. She thought that my friends mum was depriving her and would **deliberately** take veggies out of my friends hand and go ""Oh no, you don't want those **nasty** things, here, have a treat instead"" and gave her a lot of junk food. My friend was a pretty cute baby and the nanny became gradually more and more obsessed with her, constantly dressing her up and letting her do whatever she wanted, convinced she was going to marry Prince Harry. Of course, we **can't** have Prince Harry's future wife wearing the sensible dungarees that Mum bought and going outside to play in the mud... She'd be stuck in these prissy dresses all day, sat in front of the TV eating chocolate instead. Mum **hated** her (which I think is a fairly legitimate response) but Dad always assumed that Mum was feeling guilty about going back to work and leaving the baby at home and was overreacting. NOPE! This nanny even let my friend, **a toddler**, cut her hair! She didn't go to the hair dressers after or anything, she just left it like that. Dad started to think Mum might have a point round about that point... When the nanny was finally fired, she had a mental breakdown, was picked up by the police wondering around the streets at night and, eventually, she unfortunately killed herself. By that point, my friend was a chubby child with a taste for all sorts of unhealthy food. I don't think any one in her family knew how to tackle an obese child. They didn't want to psychologically mess her up body-image wise and from the sound of it, they didn't know how to put her on a diet that wouldn't stunt her growth or undo all of the unhealthy crap she'd been indoctrinated with. When she got big enough to sneak bad food there wasn't a lot they could do about it - they had to wait for her to be prepared to loose the weight herself. 

Anyway, now that my friend is ready to loose the weight, her Mum is determined to help her succeed so she doesn't end up living with the health effects of being obese or yo-yo dieting. She's paying for personal trainer sessions every couple of weeks, altering family meals to work with her diet when she's home from university and is cheering her on every step of the way. My friend says that part of what motivates her in big races is her Mum. She knows there are people who would love to be doing it and can't and that helps her keep going. My friend is loosing relatively slowly but she's an absolute machine, sports-wise (she does pull ups. At about 250-60lbs, she does **pull ups with weights strapped to her abdomen!**) She takes responsibility for her weight but a lot of people are annoyed at just how shitty a start she got and, honestly, I can see why. She's a fairly good example of someone who's never going to make excuses for her size but who probably could make a case for it if she didn't care so much about getting rid of the adipose tissue and living a high-quality life.  If you want to loose the weight, you will do it, come hell or high water but I think sometimes this sub can be a little reductionist about it. Life is messy and, whilst that shouldn't affect someone's health and life, sometimes, it does and I think sometimes acknowledging that and saying that someone absolutely can pick themselves up again and do it is more helpful than saying that they absolutely could help getting there in the first place, especially if it started when you were a kid.

Here are some studies, by the way, that demonstrate a link between masculinity and reproductive success:

giltotherescue,crossfit,1391032046.0,"I was a scrawny 15 year old kid. I wanted to bulk up some so I hired a personal trainer who happened to be a professional bodybuilder. He was huge, I figured he'd get me into shape. He taught me the basics of lifting weights, and I continued lifting on my own throughout high school and beyond into my 20s. But my diet wasn't right, and I never stayed consistent with the workout program for more than 4 or 5 months at a time. I followed the routines of professional bodybuilders as posted in magazines like Muscle &amp; Fitness, because that's what I knew. I rarely used a barbell, favoring machines that offered isolated movements. I did big sets and optimized for hypertrophy. I skipped leg day. My shoulders and arms were getting bigger, but my legs were still puny.

Then one day I happened to peer into the window of a CrossFit gym as I walked by. The setup--the medicine balls and towering rigs and the barbells--what was this place? I signed up for a class and wondered how hard could it be? I thought I was in shape because my muscles looked pretty big. I thought I'd rock it.

Wrong. I learned that first day that I had been wasting my time. I was training for aesthetics when I could be training for performance at the same time. And even though I got my ass kicked, I got high from the feeling after such an exhausting workout. I enjoyed the class setting as opposed to averting awkward eye contact through the mirrors while in between sets at the gym. With repeated practice I got better, I actually developed a visible butt, and eventually my back problems disappeared. My confidence improved and I made new friends. That was the day I went CrossFit and never went back."

I can cook an amazing beef wellington, penne pasta with scallops and homemade vodka sauce, filet minion, I guess I would have to do some inquiring to see what she likes. If we're eating fish I would grab a couple bottles of South African Sauvignon Blanc which goes amazing with scallops and other seafood or red vintage Cotes du Rhone which is a favorite of mine if the protein is red meat. For dessert I would make my good ol' American peach cobbler which leaves my family very upset when I don't make it every year for Christmas and bring it over. Maybe compliment that with some French Vanilla ice cream?

Go and check out /r/deadbedrooms and how much some of them suffer because of it. Not exploring such a huge factor of a relationship before committing to each other (supposedly) for the rest of your lives is a huge gamble.

I'm not saying that it's doomed to fail, there are people that hold out until marriage, find out they are compatible and end up having a happy marriage.

Unfortunately, the hardship you potentially face after finding out you're not compatible is nothing to take lightly. It can really mess with someone. I went through a somewhat difficult period in my relationship last year due to my SO having some issues 'down there', including vaginismus at some point, which put a huge strain on our sex life, and it took a really big toll on me emotionally at the time. Luckily for me, it was 'only' 10 months, and everything is solved now, but I can't imagine what it would feel like if something like that would last for years. I'm an emotionally very strong person, but I'm pretty sure it would eventually break me.

I'm not here to tell you you should have sex before marriage, and your arrangement is a bad idea. If both of you are happy with it, and consider the risk not big enough to outweigh your principles, good for you. Just here to give you my perspective."

turtlehana,TrueAtheism,1391032324.0,"All I can say is that we are social creators. Much like us some other animals have social expectations. This is what comes with living in a group. You break those expectations and you are punished or outcast. Morals can depend on the social expectations of that group. Which is why we sometimes look at other cultures and disagree with their culture morals and values. 

Much like animals we hunt our food and typically when we kill our food we do it quickly. It is the circle of life. Additionally cannibalism is frowned on in most species that are social. (Lions for instance after catching their prey cut the animals throat to prevent suffering). 

We all have sex. As we are social creatures there are certain expectations that fall within that whereas sharks are not and mate solely to reproduce. 

We get our morals from our society. Why else would the bible have such terrible laws like owning slaves and daughters marrying their rapist. These were reflections of the laws at the time. We also get morals from experience. When we fall down it hurts, our species decided that it didn't want to cause pain and people that cause pain are bad, etc. 

We didn't just develop overnight. 

Despite social expectations some try to change those expectations. In some cases the changes are good whereas others are not. Sometimes it takes reflection to realize it. Additionally our minds can be easily influenced based on Indoctrination, ignorance, fear, mental illness etc which is why we see such things as religion, the holocaust, individuals doing things in the name of a deity, unexplainable actions, etc. Lastly some people are just bad, whether this is a mental illness or a reflection of their experiences, their choice to defy societal expectations and not have concern for the repercussions is not a reflection on society as a whole but of the individual(s). They do know they are going against the expectations already in place and therefore are responsible.

This happens with anyone, adult or child, deemed to difficult to handle.

It's ironic that we still live in a ""throw-away"" society when there are supposedly more treatments than ever for various disorders and illnesses. How can people expect to get better when they have no one who wants them? True, you have to want to live for yourself, but when we are at our weakest, we need help. From others. Everyone does.

[Here](http://www.anandtech.com/show/2832/4). Using fewer cores allows for higher clock speeds. 

&gt;A 95W dual core processor means that individually the cores have to use less than the single 95W processor, so tradeoffs are made: each core runs at a lower clock speed.

That's how Intel's Turbo Mode works.

It's also the premise behind AMD's [MAX Turbo](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/printpage/All-AMD-FX-CPU-Models/1401)

&gt;In this case, the CPU puts these unused cores to ""sleep"", allowing it to increase its clock rate and thermal dissipation even further.

So the principle is well-established in mainstream computer architecture that sometimes it's a good idea to disable or idle some cores in order to let others operate faster.

Furthermore, you're *still* harping about performance when we're talking about raw clocks.

Finally, your voltage principle doesn't apply at all for several reasons not the least of which is the fact that it doesn't fucking work.

You're not even being recalcitrant, you're just misunderstanding everything."

That's exactly what has happened. Improving service is what causes real gains in ridership, and that costs money. Apparently they have managed to get new taxpayers enticed by the free transport so the end result is so far mostly neutral. Hopefully that will continue as they improve, but likely the costs from the new service will eventually become higher than the tax revenue gained. At that point we will really see how committed Tallinn is to the idea."

My son is 6 and in the 1st grade. His homework is assigned on a monthly basis which means that if I forget then it doesn't get done on time. 

So the rule of the house is that at least 30 mintues of homework is done every day after school (this will change as his homework increases over the years). Homework is done at the kitchen table with no tv or distractions.

As an incetive program, he gets a gummy bear for each page he completes and he gets to put a rock in a cup, at the end of the month he gets a reward based on how many rocks he has (ex. he picks where we go to dinner or we take him to the zoo or a movie)

I used to be just like your duaghter. I barely did homework, most often any work I did was 5 minutes before it needed to be turned it. These bad habits went all the way through highschool and my parents neer did anything about it.

jaynay1,leagueoflegends,1391032810.0,"Nah, this is a little more complex than you're viewing it.

Teams during S2 were not that good yet at moving around the map.  The whole prominence of laneswapping for favorable advantages and rotating to dragon/a 3v1 dive/what have you is a direct illustration of that.

S3 hits and Woong retires.  In a straight up 5v5 with no advantages, Frost would've still been very good.  The problem is that all the elite teams rotate so well that those were increasingly rare.  That, combined with the heavy prominence of strong splitpushers in Zed/Shen/Vayne made it to where there were no even 5v5's for Frost to win.

Like in large part, Frost's 5v5 teamfight went the way of the Charles Barkley back to the basket postup game.  It's a possibility, but it has specific counters(Splitpush/Help Defense) and so it's a rarity.

It's the same reason you see Gambit weakening through S3 and then gaining a little bit of strength coming into S4, even though the roster changes impacted them.  S4 has had way more straight up 5v5's than S3 did, and so Gambit gets to play the game they like to.  But, against teams that don't so much straight up 5v5(cf. Fnatic) it doesn't end well.

He is in no way affecting the way the defenders are behaving, the way the keeper is behaving, the way the ball is moving, or the way any part of that goal comes about. Unless you're saying that by just standing in an offside position he is influencing the play, in which case this whole rule is unnecessary, and we can just go back to the old offside rule.

Slukaj,todayilearned,1391032921.0,"From Wikipedia's entry on [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). Emphasis my own. 

&gt; Ada described her approach as ""poetical science""[6] and herself as an ""Analyst (&amp; Metaphysician)"".[7] As a young adult, her mathematical talents led her to an ongoing working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, and in particular Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Between 1842 and 1843, she translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which she supplemented with an elaborate set of notes of her own, simply called Notes. **These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers. She also developed a vision on the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching while others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[8]** Ada's mind-set of ""poetical science"" led her to ask basic questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.[5]

EDIT: To further cement my version of the story...

&gt;In her notes, Lovelace emphasized the difference between the Analytical Engine and previous calculating machines, particularly its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity.[65] Lovelace realised that the potential of the device extended far beyond mere number crunching. She wrote:

&gt; &gt;[The Analytical Engine] might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...

&gt; &gt;Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.[66]

&gt; This analysis was a conceptual leap from previous ideas about the capabilities of computing devices, and foreshadowed the capabilities and implications of the modern computer. This insight is seen as significant by writers such as Betty Toole and Benjamin Woolley, as well as programmer John Graham-Cumming, whose project Plan 28 has the aim of constructing the first complete Analytical Engine.[67][68][69]"

I'm not doing anything, nature is the one that is being unfair. 

&gt; because all that does is remove any responsibility from men and is entirely unfair to women....just because they are women. 

You mean nature is unfair to women and the current system does punish men, because they are not women.

Look, my solution is to negate the unfairness of nature through science. But that shit takes time, and I don't agree with these band-aid solutions that, ""Are the best we have"" (mind you I disagree that it is the best we have.), that's no excuse. Men shouldn't get shit on by the law because they were born with a Y chromosome. 

Edit: Further we can employ the same argument that is always used against men when they bring up financial abortion. If women don't like the way nature is and they suspect a guy would not support a child if she happened to get pregnant, then don't have sex with him end of story. That argument adapted from the standard, ""If you don't want to pay child support, and you don't know if the woman will get an abortion if she gets pregnant, then men don't have sex with her."""

SpectreSC,allthingsprotoss,1391032985.0,"First of all, fuck yes. Phoenixes are awesome to the max. Fast as hell, shoots twice, *shoots while moving*, slays air and ground units alike. My man crush on Phoenixes nears Gemini's crush on HerO (let's be honest, no one can top that love.)  
  
As for your actual questions - Phoenixes have a pretty good acceleration rate, so stopping them isn't a huge deal. I generally fly mine in little circles just to keep them moving, or bounce them back and forth. Since they shoot and move, and take 2 shots to kill a worker, you should be able to correct your mistakes almost immediately with either technique.  
  
With ground units, I will generally engage without my army as long as I control a rough 2:1 ratio of Phoenix to whatever I'm trying to kill (if they can shoot up. Otherwise it obviously doesn't matter.) If we're talking about using them as a support for your main force, then lifting key units such as Sentries, Immortals or Infestors should take priority. Lift them only if you're sure it's going to make a difference, don't just grab them and let all your Phoenixes die so that you can kill a couple Zealots. Zealots melt to Phoenix, so in Zealot/Stalker/Immo wars taking out his meat shields can really help you gather steam and push into his army. Use the remaining energy you have to lift all the Immortals and you could have an easy win. Reason being that Immos get bonus damage vs your Stalkers, so taking them all out of the fight vs killing 1 at a time is more advantageous for you, especially since your opponent now has to decide whether to lose the Immortals by backing off or taking the gamble with the fight minus his heavy hitters in the hopes that  
  
A) You won't completely roll him in the 10 seconds it takes for Graviton Beam to expire and  
  
B) You won't just simply re-lift the Immortals once they hit the ground.  
  
In PvZ, you should use your Phoenix to snipe Queens and Overlords and pick of straggler Hydras/Infestors/Vipers. I don't like Phoenix as much in this matchup, but that's a personal preference due to the fact that I rely on Immortal/Archon to do a lot of my heavy lifting and can't afford the gas.  
  
PvT, using Phoenix early on combined with an Oracle can decimate Marines. I personally don't care much about SCVs. Terran can't attack if he doesn't have any units, and killing ~6 Marines can let me take a 9:00 3rd base. Plus, you can set your Phoenix on patrol and have one of your drop points covered later on. I've gotten game-saving Medi kills with 3-4 hero Phoenixes on patrol.

&gt; Was predetermined by whom -- wait, when was that?

The state of the universe at any time and location - any spacetime point - is determined by the universe's state at every point in spacetime causally connected to that point in its past lightcone, to be extra rigorous, the states of which are determined by all spacetime points in their respective past lightcones. The point is that whatever neurons fired in your brain to make the decision were caused to do so by everything that occured in all of the entire universe's history that is causally connected to you. You didn't decide it, the universe did. Ergo, no free will."

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1391033146.0,"Because raising children requires *some* sort of money? I already said that the payments are fairly low. Yeah, I guess you could try arguing that depriving children of a decent standard of living because their rich father doesn't want to pay more than a poor father isn't fair... to the father. But then you're doing that thing where you're pretending that the law should be in the business of codifying the decisions of people who purposefully abandon their children and deprive them of a lifestyle they themselves think they're entitled to. You're literally saying a rich non-custodial parent has more right to their standard of living than their child has a right to a portion of their wealth.

That pretty much flies in the face of legal principles that privilege child welfare, and all sorts of familial law that has codified the principles of inheritance and custody. It would recall a massive overhual of the entire familial legal system, in favor of a system that maximizes the freedom of the most selfish individuals at the expense of *their own* biological children.

Laws do actually have connections to social taboos and cultural customs. And willful sabotage of your kid's welfare is pretty high up on the list of things we as a society have decided makes someone complete scum. So the likelihood of rewriting the legal code to tacitly endorse that sort of decision making? Not happening.

The ""political policies"" you speak of for mothers are the principles of bodily autonomy. You can't force someone to carry to term. You can't force someone to have an unwanted medical procedure. These are rights men have too, except they can't biologically have children.

And before you say that being forced to care for the welfare of your children is a violation of bodily autonomy... no. You'd be arguing that being paid money to provide for biological necessities is slavery. We may as well sue our stomachs for forcing us to work for food. Having children is the predictable biological conclusion of having sex. Might as well sue biology. The law isn't interested in hypotheticals that don't account for biological truths. A law that is pure theory with no practical application is just bullshit.

And like I said, your ""maintenance"" is often higher than the minimum child support required by many states. Most of which calculate it by the non-custodial parent's income, not the predicted need of the children. If junior was sick last month and needed to be hospitalized, the custodial parent is almost always the one who is legally required to pay those bills. The non-custodial parent is not responsible for emergences. Well, legally speaking. They should be morally speaking.

I don't think I'm going to convince you of anything, though. You seem to be stuck on the idea that the law should be codifying the interests of the most irresponsible and selfish members of society. Whereas, the actual law is interested, at least family law, in codifying principles in the best interest of children."

Candidate A (employed with a competitor) has worked more recently than Candidate B (long term unemployed).  Their resumes are relatively the same.  But when I look at Candidate B, I have to ask, is he up to date with the current trends in the field?  Is he even still knowledgeable in the field from what he knew back when he last held a job?  Are the skills he [once] had even still relevant to this field?  If he has kept up with skills, can he satisfactorily prove to me that he knows his shit?

On the other hand, candidate A has current skills, current knowledge, relevant skills, etc etc.

It's not as simple as just going ""Oh well you need to stop discriminating against long term unemployed because that's just wrong.""

got86ed,BSA,1391033197.0,"The first thing for you to realize is that your brother is not acting out because of you. It is most likely that he is either bullied himself and in frustration bullying you, or he is generally unhappy about something. This is not an excuse, it is an explanation of ones actions.

You will learn that there are bullies all throughout life. In school, in sports, in family, in friends and then into your professional life down the line. What will make you special is by how you tolerate them. Tolerance is key. What is your threshold for action? Be smart about things, envision ramifications of your actions and those it could affect. You feel that someone is getting something they shouldn't? Welcome to the real world. It sucks so be prepared.

Your brother is a jerk to you. Someday he may not be. Someday you may need him. Someday he may need you. My point is, if you feel that your brother has passed your threshold of tolerance you need to act. As opposed to blantally rejecting his efforts on receiving the Eagle Scout award, approach the adults in his life. Your parents, your Scout Master, his Patrol Leader or other adult figure. This is bigger than you and you need to let others in to help. Your goal should not to restrict his own goals (of getting Eagle) but to rather mend your relationship with your brother. If this is not possible write him off and continue on being the awesome dude you are, cause when it comes down to it your happiness is what matters. Leave the baggage behind."

jorgander,IAmA,1391033432.0,"I think that with things as they are right now, America would *probably* win.  However, there would be a lot of destruction on both sides and even the winner would sustain terrible losses.  US/RU have somewhat comparable militaries, but the reason I think America would ultimately win is that the Russian army is (as you say) not fully operational.  If it became so, it would be as powerful or more than America's military.

Of course, sheer military might would not be the only factor; economics would be important, and other countries would end up taking sides and it would not simply be Russia against USA.

A lot of people compare Russia to America in a way that sounds like ""could my father beat up your father?"".  I think that if we cooperated, who could stand against us?.

And yes, I'm not a fan of the official Ruby documentation at http://ruby-doc.org ... especially when I was just starting out. But I found the YARD-generated documentation at http://rubydoc.info pretty early on and have been using that exclusively ever since. I find the documentation there to be *very* easy to read, search and understand. I have yet to find an alternative documentation source like `rubydoc.info` for Python.

lana-del-boy,AskMen,1391033583.0,"&gt; Most of the posts in here have contained qualifiers in which the poster explained that they disliked radical feminist beliefs and feminists who don't abide by the actual equality message, which is the core.

I know, but I honestly believe that AskMen as whole is one of the nicer subs. The top answer, for example, is fantastic. I'm referring solely to the answers that say ""ugh, feminists"" not the well-reasoned ones. I also agree with the ""ugh, activists"" posts tbh, cause activists can be annoying
&gt; 
&gt;  Since you are likely a feminist, (Derived from your response that reads as a defense from one who feel as though they are being attacked) you are therefore likely hurt that people would not want to date you. It is understandable to be defensive about this but surely you must recognize that not all persons who identify as Feminists carry the same beliefs as you, and thus an an attack on them is not the same as an attack lodged against you.

I do acknowledge that I made a serious leap in logic, and I should probably amend my post to rectify that. Having said that, I do believe that when people have such strong and sometimes disgusted reactions towards feminists (who, as you agreed, fundamentally only want equal rights for women) that says something about how they feel about women as a whole.

Basically, what I'm trying (badly) to say, is that the only thing that links all feminists together is the belief that women should have equal rights and opportunities. So what is it that annoys people about feminists? That they want to be respected? I honestly don't know. The crazy-activist angle, I understand. The man-hating angle, I get it. But discounting a woman just because she's a feminist? That, to me, suggests that you have some very...traditional views about how women should be treated, and women, traditionally, weren't treated very well.

This is why that a disdain towards feminists as a whole suggests, to me at least, a disdain for women.

As for the whole ""you're offended cause askMen don't want to date you thing""...um, no. I'm getting annoyed because I feel that feminism is being misrepresented, not because I'm feeling insecure.

If someone on reddit said ""oh I don't want to date a girl with small boobs"" or ""I wouldn't want to date a girl with freckles"" I'd move on with my day cause who gives a shit if I don't meet someone's criteria for a partner? Lots of fish in the sea. "

Geohump,AskReddit,1391033608.0,"Its not because you are a Christian Republican.

In general, many politically-right people are completely confused about what it means to be real Christian.

Many CR's (Christians on the Political Right) have been misled by the self-aggrandizing re-write of history presented by the far right, ( ""Regan ended the cold war"" - no the cold war ended because the USSR's economy collapsed under the weight of its own inefficiency. ""Regan's Tax cuts cause massive prosperity""  Regan's Tax cuts have created a US economy where 40% of the households no longer pay income tax because they can't earn enough income. etc.. ) 

The far-right-Christian ethos has become a tirade of rants against the poor, claiming that their situation is all their own fault, while at they same time the self-same ""Christians"" are implementing polices that remove all full time employment and benefits from all the entry level works at huge companies like Wal-Mart (2 million employees ), McDonalds, Sears, K-mart etc..... 

Ask yourself why the GOP is in such disarray that they had to have **three different responses** to the sotu? 

Why is the TEA party so popular but unable to get anything done except slow down or prevent progress on important issues?  

(FYI - I'm an independent, fiscally conservative, progressive on policy, since the days of Teddy Roosevelt, had I been alive then. To be frank I dislike both main parties but I hate the extreme right. I dislike the left for not being as competent or having as much integrity s they should, but I hate the extreme right because they are fomenting hate, practicing racism, and frankly, are evil.

fnredditacct,changemyview,1391033733.0,"The problem with ""No means Stop"" is that it requires further communication.

Which, usually, is good. Maybe most of the time is good.

But that's a very vulnerable position to be in. 

""Stop and reassess"" immediately puts me a defensive position of having to explain why. 

Then I'm not only vulnerable because I'm small, vulnerable, and he thought it was a go, but also because I'm taking a verbally defensive position that I have to try to hold.

The natural reaction, (not just in sexual situations), to someone saying ""I don't want to X because of Y"" is ""Well I can fix Y, so lets X.""

Which, on the surface is good.  But frequently, that doesn't *feel* like problem solving. Frequently what it feel like is an 'offensive attack  on the defenses I just erected."" *offense as used in sports, not as in insulting*

And, especially but not exclusively, if I was already feeling nervous, now I'm REALLY feeling nervous.

Because I just gave a reason that was countered. And so what do I do next?

If it was some easy fix like, ""I don't want to do this in the living room"" ""okay, let's move to the bedroom"" that's fine, no nerves at all.

But if it was something like ""I feel too full after eating"" ""Okay we'll wait until you don't feel full"" or ""I can give you a backrub, that will help"" That doesn't sit so well.

Because then that puts pressure on me, for the solution to work.

And if it doesn't, or if it's not easily fixable and he keeps trying, I get REALLY REALLY nervous.

Because then it's starting to, *in the little part of me that knows it's prey*, feel like just *maybe* there will always be a ""solution"" to why I don't want to.

Maybe no reason I give will be good enough.

*added in edit:* *And that ""little part that knows it's prey,"" for me, has instincts to ""just keep quiet, don't escalate the situation, it will be over more quickly.""* *This can easily turn a situation that, on HIS part carried absolutely NO INTENT of pressure or coercion into a perceived non consensual situation to me. Because I got too scared to maintain my position, my reason.*

""No means No"" means that I don't have to come up with a reason **that he accepts as a valid reason** to not engage, or to stop engaging. 

""No means stop"" means that I have to keep supplying reasons until there is one, *if there is one?* that he accepts.

JorddyK,Aquariums,1391033739.0,"I know the feeling! One of my saddest (and admittedly cutest) childhood memories was of my favorite fish in an aquarium my parents had when I was younger passing away. She was a female Pleco and had the coolest beige stripes you had ever seen. Her name was Big Momma, even though she was the only Pleco in the tank and had never had any fry (people used to say that two Plecos should never live in one tank). Big Momma was the queen of that tank, she lived in a big cave made of stacked up slate rocks and always would come out and beg for a slice of zucchini! She was older than me at the time, they had purchased her as the first fish in their aquarium around the time when my parents decided to have me. 

I must have been five or six. I had come home from a weekend trip to Storyland with my Mom, Dad, and Uncle who was my age too. When I got home, I ran right to the tank, first thing! There she was, just leaning on one of those slate rocks not moving. I started *bawling*.

Big Momma is one of the reasons I love Plecos. Since we grew up together, I learned how fast Plecos grow and saw my parents upgrading their tank multiple times to keep her happy and healthy. I mastered the art of fish husbandry from a young age. 

I don't remember this, but when she passed, my mom tells me I asked her why ""things die even if you love them"". Big Momma taught me that death was natural and happens to every living creature- yes, even if you love them."

Kayden01,AskReddit,1391033745.0,"What did they do? Let's see.
Gillard engaged in a rant about misogyny in the middle of Parliament because her opponent *looked at his watch*.
Introduced a laughable carbon tax that *nobody* will state would have any climate effect whatsoever, but which is guaranteed to very negatively effect what manufacturing still remains in country.
Hell, Abbott was never a hard core anti-warming politician until *Gillard/Rudd made it a primary platform*.
Then there were Gillards deals to get the support of the independents. A new hospital in Tas, and pokie reform in NSW. Remind me, did she keep either of those promises?
Gillard forced out a respected Speaker in Harry Jenkins in order to promote LNP deserter Peter Slipper - that couldn't possibly have backfired much worse.

Every decision made by either Gillard or Rudd seemed to be a personal power play, never focusing on political change, party platform or keeping election promises.

Labour completely sold out their constituencies (namely lower middle class working families and blue collar retirees) in order to gain support from the Greens, and I believe that in doing so, they have massively hurt their brand at a national level.

As to who cares who Gillard sleeps with - you don't think that having the fist female PM having slept with 3 - 4 of the major power brokers within her party sends a bad message? It has a bearing on how the party is run, and on public perception of the PM and the ruling party.

As for the mining boom, investment started dying mid 2012, the same time the carbon tax went online and not long after the extra mining tax went online. When you take the only big money growth industry in a country and apply extra taxes and restrictions with the stated goal of reducing the profitability of that industry, you're likely to kill that industry."

non-relevant,soccer,1391033781.0,"No, this is exactly my point. Devineman's point is that because Adebayor jumped for the ball, it was offside.


We can all agree that Adebayor would not be considered offside in current rules if he had been nowhere near the ball, right? Despite someone marking him, and thus 'affecting' that defender. The fact that he is nearer the ball does not change how much he is affecting that defender, and the fact that he jumps, which is Devineman's argument, changes that even less.

Standing in an offside position and thereby having a defender marking a 'meaningless' player does not constitute interfering with play, or the whole 'interfering with play' part of the offside rule would be unnecessary.

My point is that he is not affecting anything more by jumping for the ball, especially as Hart is diving to where he anticipates the cross is going, rather than Adebayor's theoretical header. 


The fact that there is no defender marking Adebayor just makes this even stupider though, because we're now talking about a hypothetical defender that hypothetically may be been affected by Adebayor jumping to head a cross."

Once you're as sweaty as can be (takes maybe 15 minutes), you run out and swim or roll in the snow (or in an urban environment just take a cold shower) and then get back in if you feel like it. During a longer session on a holiday I might easily go back and forth 4-5 times. Just remember to drink enough water to keep from dehydrating.

What does an American school kid have to do with New Zealand? Americans will say Australia either way because Australia is more well known than New Zealand because it is bigger, more economically important, and is a more worldwide trade partner due to its minerals. The flags when put next to each other cannot be called similar, one is blue and white, the other is blue and red, it's like calling the French and Romanian flags similar.

Why are you being an asshole about it? I'm explaining things in a proper manner and discussing why I think the way I do. You, on the other hand, are trying to refute points by bringing up irrelevant points (American schoolchildren), denouncing proper terminology (fly and hoist), and not looking at the massive differences between the flags that I've explained twice before now.

portugalthephilosoph,philosophy,1391034180.0,"Here's the biggest problem of all:

I am ECSTATIC that you guys are having this discussion in England. Because the US doesn't teach philosophy in the public school system at all. 

My first encounter with philosophy was in Lincoln-Douglas debate in high school. But in my high school of 1500 kids, only 4 of us did LD. This was an extra-curricular activity and all of the philosophy that I learned was self-taught, or by discussing things with the other 3 LDers. 

The high school I went to did not even offer philosophy courses. Locke and Hobbes were mentioned briefly in Social Studies (read: history and civics), but only as inspiration for the democratic system or some shallow bullshit. Ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology are not required, or even *offered*. 

I somehow found my way to an excellent Jesuit university with an incredible philosophy department, but I felt like I was going into my philosophy courses with a completely blank slate. Even now, with a B.A. in philosophy (I actually took my final oral exam today, and he said I passed!), I'm intimidated by the prospect of a masters degree in the field because I don't think my mind has developed enough in philosophy to take it on. Had my education started sooner, I may have been able to avoid forming the illogical premises that I developed in my high school years. My peers that came from private schools didn't seem to face that same obstacle. 

Luckily, I found a bunch of other philosophy nerds on the internet (yea, that's you guys and gals) that I can learn from and debate with. Maybe in a couple years I can get back to school and keep pursuing a Ph.D. Somewhat unfortunately, I'll have to keep working in politics until then to try to change some of the problems I see. 

If the British school system is teaching philosophy to all public school systems, then that is better than what the Americans are doing. I hope that they will realize the critical separation between philosophy and religion, but *at least you're having the discussion*. "

For other people they have a complete disregard for any dietary restrictions whatsoever and they seem to think they do fine. Obviously I have no way of knowing what type of experience they've had.  Everyone's body is different and we eat different types of foods so it's hard to say what will be the right thing for each person. That being said I would suggest following the dietary restrictions closely for at least a week for the best results since you want to make it the best possible experience.

http://www.herbalandwellbeingsanctuary.com/pre_ayahuasca_ceremony_dietas.html

I think one of the most important things to restrict is cheeses and preserved/fermented foods, vinegars, and the like.  Give me a bit and I'll come up with the specific component that they contain that is bad.  

Tyramine is something you should work to stay away from for at least a week prior. Some literature says 24hrs but I disagree at least for a beginner, I say a week at least.  In addition to the physical prep this is also a mental preparation and to give it a bit of ritual and reverence, you pay close attention to your body and also your mind.  "

hopewings,elderscrollsonline,1391034329.0,"Every new AAA MMORPG that came out in the last decade has charged $60 for box price and a $15/month subscription, even before WoW.  It's just that WoW came along and was so popular that a lot of the others went F2P later.

$60 + $15/month was the price in 2003 when Lineage II came out.  It's now 2014, and the price for a brand new MMORPG is still $60.  Inflation adjusted, it's actually cheaper now to play MMORPGs than it was over ten years ago.  A decade ago when I was a broke college student, I paid the $60 and subscription fees for gaming, because it still came out to be cheaper than going to movies or paying for cable TV.

Of course, as a lot of games now have gone F2P, people are complaining about the few companies that still dare to charge the old $60.  But you know, they're still a company, need to pay their employees and bills, and they don't work for free.  I have paid at least $60 to various F2P games like Neverwinter and Rift because I enjoyed my time in them, and I wanted to support the developers.

Bottom line: if you have fun in a game, pay for it.  If you don't, take your money elsewhere.  

P.S.: I wish I could get into the beta, so I'd know whether or not I actually want to spend the $60 on this game.

If you're going to bait, don't start off so obviously.  Subtlety is the key.  If you're serious, then you probably shouldn't be posting here.

&gt; I was one of the people who did my best to know he was loved but I guess it wasn't enough and it pisses me off.

It sounds like your brother had a lot on his plate and was dealing with a lot of personal depression.  Obviously domestic abuse and familial rejection were factors in this, they would be for anyone, but your brother had more on his plate than being gay in and of itself.

&gt; There isn't much point to this post other than to remind gay people who are contemplating suicide not to do it.

Try just people in general, this is about suicide, not necessarily him being gay.  I imagine that in fact it was his family's rejection which led him to this.  There's not much you can do to someone that's more damaging than being a parent and rejecting your own child for something like that, it's an *exceptionally* low thing to do.

&gt;What he did to me is literally unforgivable.
Don't be selfish. If you don't want to live for yourself, live for someone else.

Okay, I'm sorry, here's where I draw the line.  His suicide was *not about you.*  He did not live *for you.*  He shouldn't live *for you,* and honestly, I think it's unfair to retroactively demand that he live so that you don't feel awful.  If he committed suicide after a long period of contemplation as most people who commit suicide do, then it was because he didn't feel as though his life was worth living, and though I'm not advocating for suicide and I still feel that people in that position who are serious ought to seek help, it's cruel to demand someone live their life for you just because you enjoy them being alive while they don't.

It was his life, not yours, and he got to do with it what he saw fit to do.  I'm not saying I *agree* with his suicide, I think most suicide is tragic, but ""Dammit he should have lived for me!"" is not the right lesson to take away from this."

Mostly because much of the difficult time he was going through was due to his own poor decisions and irresponsibility, and I knew that I no longer trusted him to be a contributing partner to the relationship. That having been said, he was in a position where he was out of a job, totally broke, and about to be evicted. He literally had no where to go - except for moving in with me. It was a very hard decision, but I knew if I let him move in he would try to sell pot out of my home, continue not to work, and I definitely didn't have the financial resources to support him even had I wanted to. If, previous to this, he had been proactive about finding work (and keeping it when he found it), it would have been different, but he wasn't going to change at this point. I ended it two days before he was to be evicted. He reacted very badly, I cut all contact once he got nasty and vengeful, and I have no idea what happened to him in the end."

Tripi,Parenting,1391034480.0,"I have had similar experiences with therapists, and some of them have made very hurtful and incorrect statements. I had one occupational therapist say he thought my son was on the spectrum because he did lots of ""funny little drawings"" which was a ridiculous thing to say because the way a child draws has nothing to do with autism, and my son didn't do ""funny little drawings"" he did lovely, imaginative drawings like most kids do. A speech therapist said she was ""concerned about his thinking skills"" because he kept getting the answers wrong in speech therapy. She didn't realise that he was getting everything wrong on purpose, because he was at that age where some kids do that - I thought it was obvious that he was just being mischievous, but it wasn't to her. I wish the speech therapists would be more imaginative in their activities. It seems to be entirely based around sitting activities, when lots of small children just want to be active and have a chance to get up and move around. Also the unfamiliar setting used to mean that my son didn't say a word because he felt uncomfortable (kids without speech delays will do exactly the same thing in unfamiliar settings). 

The fact is, therapists do not have the training required to make those judgements (autism, intellectual disability, etc.). I have no doubt that most of them have good intentions, but to suggest that a child is going to have life-long problems when you are not qualified to do so is careless at best. Any real concerns need to be referred to a developmental paediatrician. (At least, this is how it works in Australia, the process is no doubt different in different countries.)

Another thing I did which was quite good was ask our speech therapist to put me in touch with another parent whose child was a similar age and similar level of speech. It was great to share notes and get the kids together to play. Would highly recommend trying to find a network of parents with kids with speech delays in your area if you can. Feel free to get in touch with me in the future too - I think you can PM on here? - happy to continue our conversation in to the future as it can be difficult to find people with similar experiences in this area.

Now,  I feel glad to have the opportunity to better understand privilege and each person's personal journey through the intersection of their struggles and privileges and my own.

This puts stress on the rotator cuff and risks causing an injury.  So not only would doing normal pullups be more effective in terms of strength training, but it would be safer too.

I never experienced hazing and I didn't feel pressured to dress a certain way or buy specific things.

Midgetgirl05,AskReddit,1391034645.0,"The Trouble with Freshmen - Written by Rachel Cassidy and Katie Hiltz, Senior Year Highschool English

***Intro: Katie Hiltz and I wrote this satire for our first hour English class, our Senior Year in High School. We had A LOT of fun with this, and I'm actually surprised I still had a copy of it on my old hard drive! Now...without further adieu... ""The Trouble with Freshmen"" ***

A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…Ok, Ok! So it wasn’t that long ago…or that far away. Geez, picky aren’t you. Anyhow, about a decade ago, (give or take a year or six) there was a high school named Akona.

 

Millions of voices flew through the hallway, massive confusion echoing in everyone’s voice.

 

“Wasn’t school supposed to start at 7:30?? I’ve been here for what seems like forever and the five minute bell has yet to ring!” a confused senior pondered out loud.

 

“No,” drawled a junior, whose hair was sticking out at every angle, like a bad Japanese cartoon. “Our ‘little brothers and sisters’ AKA the bloody freshman, complained it was too earlier, so they moved it to 7:45 so suit their wills.”

 

“Dude, that’s so bogus…its just fifteen freaking minutes!!!” cried out a sophomore, who was just as upset, for they had to be at school at 7:30.

 

At the opening Day Ceremony, there were Bond Squad members dressed in their flashy purple armor with neon yellow shields, guarding the doors to the assembly room. The captains of the Bond Squad were also handing out t-shirts to all but the freshman. These, traffic-cone-colored orange t-shirts with vibrant, glow-in-the-dark pink lettering stated on the front “Don’t pick on the Freshmen” and continued on the back saying “They’re our younger siblings…WE’RE A FAMILY!” When someone tried to decline having to put it on, he was wrestled to the ground and forced into the shirt, kicking and screaming. When the principle walked by, she merely smiled and ignored the helpless cries of the poor guy on the ground.

 

“GOOD MORNING AKONA HIGH SCHOOL!” shouted Principle Roach. “There will be some changes this year to honor our loveable, incoming freshman. First off, classes WILL begin at 7:45 instead of 7:30, because the freshman aren’t used to waking up so early. Secondly, the Senior/Freshman sibling rivalry competition this year will be taking place.”

 

Boos and hisses were heard echoing throughout the gym, except the side with the freshman, who were smirking and looking rather proud of themselves.

 

“This is because the Bond Squad feels the competition is a poor way to welcome our new additions to the family, which also happens to be degrading and insulting.”

 

“It’s supposed to be!” shouted a junior in pure outrage. “That’s how its always been!”

 

“Detention Mr. Lecher,” replied Principal Roach in a gleeful tone.

 

“Down the Bond Squad! THIS IS BULL-MRRF!” Isaah Lecher was muffled, wrestled to the ground viciously and was dragged bodily from the assembly.

 

“There is also one more thing. Upperclassmen will no longer tell lies about the pool being on the third floor, since we have no pool, nor a third floor.”

 

At this, the roars and cries of outrage filled the room, bouncing and resounding from the walls.

 

“You can’t DO that!”

 

“That’s the oldest trick!”

 

“You’re ruining tradition!”

 

“I don’t care. We are a family,” she said in a sweet, simpering tone. “And, we must love one another! Freshman, as you are leaving today, you will be supplied with a map to the school, as well as given twenty extra minutes to find your classes. Therefore, you will not have to deal with the risk of getting told wrong by the Upperclassmen and getting lost.”

 

There was more of an outburst and many sophomores, juniors and seniors were red in the face with the effort of yelling so loudly in anger.

 

Looking most happy at the turn of events the principal announced with utmost glee, “Well! Due to this outrageous show of dissention, every single student, freshmen not included, will stay half an hour after school, every day for a week, to write lines on why we are a family!”

 

The silence was immediate. Faces, many glowing red with anger, glared down at Roach, wishing they could step on her and smite her down. A few people had to be restrained by the peers from launching themselves at her and causing a riot.

 

So, you can see what a problem we were having with the younger ones of our age. That first day, at least forty students were placed into detention for making fun of the freshman. Many upper classmen were afraid to go out of their classrooms, too terrified to go near the freshman, for fear of being trampled by the Bond Squad and placed under Home-Room Arrest.

 

The second day rolled around, a drizzly, foul weathered day. Viviane, a senior of the high school, had missed the excitement of the first day, due to viewing a college down south. This was not a good thing. Not a good thing at all.

 

The two-minute bell rang and a Mr. McCoy shouted above the crowd “Ok children, here’s what we’re gunna do. You kiddies are gunna head to class and not be late!”

 

Viviane, seeing her class room door past a mob of people in the hallway slipped through them, trying to be unnoticed. Unfortunately, the group comprised of twelve very full of themselves freshman.

 

“Oooh! A big and scary senior! I’m quaking in my little booties now!” spat out one of the freshman girls.

 

“Walk around us ya big lump! We can take you out if we want!” sneered one of the boys of the crowd.

 

Feeling rather upset at this onslaught, she retorted back “Don’t block the hallway then you dunderheads!”

 

Mr. McCoy caught her and dragged her over to the side, flanked by two smirking Bond Squad members, who slightly resembled sentries of the Middle Ages. “Be nice to the freshman you! ‘Tis only their second day here in our lovely school and you have to be nice to them or pay the price!”

 

Viviane began to protest this most obvious unfairness but was silenced when a Squad member covered her mouth and smirked.

 

“No buts young missy! Just because you’re a senior doesn’t give you an excuse to harass and make fun of the freshman! You’re lucky I’m being so nice! You should be clapped in irons and put under Home-Room Arrest!”

 

She only glared at the teacher and stalked off to class, thinking to herself, about marching band, and how at least she wouldn’t have to deal with this kind of ridiculousness in marching band.

 

When the clock struck Three O’clock, the marching Dodos assembled on the field next to the school to go through their drill charts.

 

“We need to run through those last three charts again! Ready GO!” shouted Mr. Stuart Muffin.

 

Getting quickly to her spot, she went to attention and was astounded to see five people hobbling to the side lines. All of whom, were freshman.

 

“I can’t!” whined one of them, a girl with gothic look to her. “I don’t feel good!”

 

“I can’t either” complained another, who always seemed to follow the lead of the first. “My stomach hurts! I want to sit down.”

 

The other three said nothing; they just sat down, and then proceeded to have a long conversation, looking rather cheerful and animated.

 

Looking over a little to the right, she saw one of the woodwinds basically fainting on the field. He was a junior, and no matter what, was found on the field, in sickness and in health. Finally, after tripping a few times, he went to go sit down and rest, looking about to pass out.

 

“And what do you think your doing Mit! You looked fine out there marching a minute ago! Back on the field!” growled one of the instructors.

 

So, poor Mit was forced to march on. Viv, horrified at this, wondered what had happened to her good little school. She decided to demand changes from the head honcho, Roach.

 

The next day, she walked into Roach’s office to demand changes. One moment she was arguing with the principal and the next she was being gagged and dragged out of the office, pulled along by several Bond Squad members. The last thing she saw was a door saying “Rioter’s Quarters” and the darkness inside. She screamed and screamed and she was thrown into the room.

 

“AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!” she woke up screaming the first day of school, panting hard. “It was all a dream” she murmured to herself.” Just a dr…” As she was saying this, she saw in horror the nasty colored orange and pink t-shirt that had been laid out on her desk. A thrush outside her window took off in a panic as a blood curdling scream was loosed into the morning air."

JonWood007,BasicIncome,1391034652.0,"It is, and it will just become more feasible as technology grows. The real question is whether it's politically acceptable, since it would require some radical changes.

Take the federal budget of $3.45 trillion. We can eliminate social security ($800B), medicare/medicaid ($750B), welfare ($400B), and probably some defense and other miscellaneous cuts ($200B). 

This leaves us with a federal budget of $1.3 trillion or so.

We can replace the medical programs with universal healthcare, since it would be more efficient to do it this way than to have people buy insurance and all. Most other countries spend around $3000 per citizen, or around 10% of GDP, depending which figure you take, you'll get different numbers. If you take the $3000 figure, you can spend around $1 trillion for UHC, but if you go by GDP, you're more likely to spend closer to $1.5 trillion. I'll use 1.3 trillion for the sake of estimate. This means we have federal outlays of $2.6 trillion (to be fair, states will cut their programs too, so you'd save a lot there). 

next phase, a tax code change. Eliminate the entire income and payroll tax code. Replace it with about a 40% flat tax on all earned income. No loopholes, no deductions, no nothing. Well, ok, since capital gains go into that, in order to make the 40% tax more acceptable, we can allow for a 40% capital loss deduction to make the gambling ""fair"", but yeah, other than that. Same with corporate rates, jack them up to 40% to prevent abuse (only profit taxed, obviously).

http://jsfiddle.net/3bYTJ/11/

Going by that calculator, assuming 230 million adults eligible, 2.6 trillion in other outlays, and using those numbers (which, looking up the stats themselves, are accurate), the numbers add up. Every adult US citizen will be able to get $15,000, cash. Or, if they desire, I'd say they can take it in form of a tax credit or deduction. 

So, let's see how this works for numerous income levels.

Minimum wage is currently $7.25 and that's $15,000 a year, roughly. So they pay $6,000 in taxes and then get their $15k UBI. So they end up with $24,000.

Say they jack it up to $10.10 like Obama proposes, which I'd deem unnecessary with UBI, but let's work on the numbers. That's $21,000 a year. You'd get taxed on about $8400 of that, but get a $15k UBI. So you'd make a total of $27,600. 

Say you make around the household median income of $52,000 a year. That's $20,800 in taxes, but it would only be $5,800 after UBI, or 11.2% in effect. 

Say you make $1,000,000 a year. You get taxed for $400,000, but get the same $15,000. So you'd end up with a 38.5% tax rate. Considering these guys currently pay around 20%, they're gonna be unhappy, but they're still freaking rich and going home with $615,000, so I see it as perfectly fair.

So yeah, the math is feasible. I'll admit, this is kind of the rough, perfect world numbers, maybe the real numbers would be different somehow due to finding ways to avoid taxes, etc., or maybe more outlays than I'm accounting for, but you can get the gist of it. Some people fear capital flight with taxes those high, but considering how a lot of other countries have effective rates in the 30-40% range and don't have problems, I don't see a problem. You still will have state and local taxes, but I'd see these getting cut since they'd no longer need safety nets themselves. Regardless, I can see most people, even top earners, keeping at least half their paycheck, with ALL taxes taken into consideration.

This budget is also revenue neutral, which should make people who care about the deficit happy. "

BandarSeriBegawan,solotravel,1391034663.0,"Well, let me put it this way.

What is the definition of *need*?

Is it really as barren and spartan as people like you tend to make it out to be in an argument like this? (In your version: 

&gt;Live in a 100 square foot hut, drink water, eat bread and salad, and give every remaining penny to charity. Remember to never see a movie or read a book either, because you could spend that time volunteering instead.)

I rather think ""need"" constitutes the minimum you need to be at your top functioning to as efficiently as possible do good in the world. As in factories you find that workers are more productive overall if they can take breaks, the vision of taking only what you need is not near so utilitarian (not in the figurative meaning of the word, at least) as you imagine.

So you eat a varied healthy diet, and take breaks in the sun, or visit your mom in your hometown, but you also don't fly first class, or pack an extra bag and incur a worthless $25 fee just to have extra shirt options during your stay. 

In short, you take holistically take good care of yourself and your own happiness, but you give all your purpose-driven effort and resources to something better than a globetrot. 

You could maybe try to argue that to be fully mentally healthy and driven to do good in the rest of your life, you *need* the globetrot under the more holistic definition outlined above, but I think you'd have a hard time. I certainly did, hence my own changed view on the subject. 

EDIT: I might also mention that an ascetic lifestyle has been seen by many sages throughout the ages (and the present) as the road to real happiness/fulfillment. So it may not be as horrible as you imagine it would be, to live with only what you need."

xthorgoldx,TheRedPill,1391034770.0,"These are the presumptions of Objectivism, the moral ethos of which your utopia is built upon (knowingly or not):

1. Existence exists
2. Living beings *must act* in order to exist; i.e. existence is not a ground state.
3. Man is a rational animal.
4. Reason is man's basic tool for survival.
5. Since man is not governed by instincts, he needs rules to live by (ethics).
6. Morals are thus derived from self-preservation and self-interest.
7. Rational self interest is socially benevolent; to steal or mooch is to violate intellectual integrity, which violates the axiom of existence (to live, one must act).

(Note: This is not a straw man presentation; this is a summary of Rand's own Defense of Objectivism).

Here are the errors with that set of premises:

1. No error; though some would find the epistemology here to be lacking.
2. This one is part of a greater arc, we'll get back to it.
3. Man is *not* a rational animal, not even close. One might even argue that it's our irrationality that lends us our uniqueness. Man is *capable* of reason, but in that regard is the only animal known to be capable of *abstract* reasoning. But, in fact, or defiance of ""instinct"" is what makes us irrational - instinct is nothing more than reason (the thought process that drives an animal to act in favor of its own existence, Premise #2) distilled into genetic inclinations -  instinct is reason incarnate. Yet Rand both claims that man is a completely rational animal while in the same breath claiming that man defies instinct.
4. If reason is man's primary drive to survive, how has natural selection not killed off the stupid? You run into an ontological paradox - if the illogical rely on altruism to survive, and altruism is a result of people acting irrationally, how did they come into being in the first place? One need look no farther than a baby to see how man's tools of survival are *not* reason - how do babies survive, being the *definition* of parasites? They do it by being cute (literally, the studies on this are fairly interesting), which is additionally another throwback to why the assertion that ""man is not governed by instincts"" is wrong.
5. This premise is incorrect in that it's an expansion on the idea that man does not *always* act by instinct and thus needs rules to govern those actions not done instinctively. However, its complete denial of human instinct is false, as displayed by *countless* scientific studies - for example why do women date men (or vice versa) that are irresponsible when more stable, logical partners are available? Because they think the other person is sexy, and that flips a genetic trigger for ""Their DNA is good, let loose the endorphins.""
6. Part of the same argument as #2, we'll visit it soon.
7. Pure self-interest is incompatible with a free society. A person who is truly acting in pure self-interest doesn't create a free market, they create crony capitalism - if you need an example, see Rockefeller, or Carnegie, or British Imperialism. The thing is, living a contradiction (applying different rules to others than to yourself) *will kill you,* that much Rand got right. Which brings us back to points 2 and 6.

What's the basic problem with Randian morality? It assumes that the nature of living beings is to survive. Wrong.

**The nature of living beings is to die.**

Name a single thing in the existence of the universe that has lived. Bacteria, the earliest life, have a lifespan of a few minutes to a few days. Humans live for 60 years to a century, depending on how we manage the breakdown of our physiological processes. The oldest living lifeforms on earth, trees, have a record set at 2,000 years or so. **The death rate for living things is 100%, and the laws of reality itself state that this is not optional.** (2nd Law of Thermodynamics - even if you're ""immortal,"" that only means you'll be ripped apart with the rest of the universe).

Individuals don't survive - *groups do.* Families do, cultures do, empires do. Altruism *is* survival, and it's empirically discernable - people who don't find children appealing (""cute"") don't tend to reproduce, and their genetic line *ends.* A man may die in battle as an individual, but the *idea* of what he was and, more importantly, what he did will live on for countless generations.

**In short, Rand's argument falls to the following errors:**

1. Man is *not* rational, due to physiological, psychological, and genetic influence.
2. Life's driving goal is *not* to survive as an individual, as this is impossible; life's driving goal is to survive as a society.
3. Pure self-interest in the individual is, therefore, contrary to survival. 

Rand assumes that the inclination of every human is to act in their own self-interest and pleasure, and that altruistic societies are the result of people acting to the contrary; furthermore, that altruistic tendencies are a construct of these parasitic societies that can be cast off by ""liberated"" individuals. *This is laughably incorrect.*

And guess what? **That's the premise of your utopia.** That everyone, being capable of full rationality (false) will act in their own self interest (false) to the benefit of all (*false*). For such a society to exist, you'd need to selectively breed humans for the sole purpose of selecting for *psychopathy,* as in your utopia the presence of empathy would break it to the core. The problem is, psychopaths aren't interested in survival - they care about themselves, yeah, but that's a futile struggle; the only way to survive is through lineage, and the prerequisites for your utopia will also require that your utopia will die out completely within a generation. Those interested in the continuance of the utopia would themselves be unsuitable to operate inside of it!"

bluefire579,Texans,1391034794.0,"Evans only accounted for 23% (69 receptions) of Johnny's completed passes (maybe less, I didn't subtract the first half of the Rice game). He also completed 60 times to Malcomme Kennedy, 51 times each to Derrel Walker and Travis Labhart, and managed to spread the rest across 13 more receivers (excluding 2 who caught a single pass each in garbage time), which is more than the number of UCF receivers who even caught a pass this season.

And were that not the case, so what? Of the 4 best QBs in the NFL (Manning, Brady, Rodgers, and Brees), only Peyton did not have a large disparity in yards between his top 2 receivers, and Brady and Rodgers did not have nearly as good of a distribution amongst their top 4 receivers as Johnny did. Every quarterback at both college and pro level has a ""safety blanket,"" because when you need to make a play, you need a receiver you trust completely.

Edit: Undeniably there were several witnesses to the incident. I travel there every day to and from work, and if I left work on time yesterday (3:45), would probably have actually been a witness myself. It's a very busy road, and it happened right next to the big bus stop on Clarence St/Erskine corner. There would have been both large volumes of train and bus commuters nearby. 

Too early to draw straws, but media usually like to pin blame on the state government/travel authorities because it draws attention from the majority - but the lack of 'blame game' on this topic tells my spidey-sense that this was either a jay-walk incident, or an unfortunate accident."

Laozen,gaybros,1391034809.0,"This isn't exactly a new argument, though.  If you look at some of the history between gay males and feminist groups, it can be a mixed bag when it comes to straight women.  There were feminist groups that fought for LGBT rights, LGB rights while excluding the T, LB rights while excluding G and T (look up 'political lesbianism' some time, it's tragilarious), and a number of other weird combinations.

I think the lesson here is that picking and choosing which groups you're fighting for is a fool's errand, you're only going to do yourself a disservice if you think that arguing for the rights of X *over* Y is going to get you anywhere.

I've never been to a gay bar, it's entirely possible that straight women have dealt with some bullshit at some gay bars, but for perspective, they could try being straight women at bars directed towards lesbians to correct for whatever gender privilege they feel males have at gay bars.  I imagine that would be a good example of what gay males feel at straight bars and would illustrate nicely why gay bars exist."

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391034835.0,"&gt; I have no idea what the purpose of this Bronze Age Middle Eastern story was. How is this relevant?

Well, in this context, it's the fact that you cant get anything done if people cant communicate.

&gt;And yet we are communicating. In spite of the complete lack of laws forcing us to use the same language. According to your theory, this would have to result in chaos, but all I can see here is order.

Fair enough, perhaps not a good example to how rights enforcement agenices work.

&gt;Are you aware that there were many societies in history which did not have a territorial monopoly on law? For example, in Medieval Islam, there were several different legal schools which interpreted religious law differently. They were able to co-exist in the same city. On top of that, there were separate courts and legal rules for Christians and Jews. In spite of that, this system worked.

There's also been a lot of persecution. 

&gt;So by that standard, any dictator is a legitimate ruler who has the consent of the governed as long as his subjects don't rise up against him. Do you really want to support Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and the Kims?

No, but given the chance, I'm sure many people would leave."

fiat_lux_,PurplePillDebate,1391034856.0,"&gt; I heartily disagree - you can value the feelings of others by being politically correct and still engage in frank, honest debate. In fact one of the first times I commented here was in a discussion about race.

I have to disagree with you in turn. I come from a heavily liberal/progressive/culturally sensitive background.

Politically correct groups usually don't have the most ""frank, honest"" discussions. It goes beyond just political correctness, but overall sensitivity.

Nice people just avoid conflict. 

&gt; Any approach that neglects to examine its own biases won't get within 50 feet of objectivity.

I agree. 

But the key here is that non-PC groups broach contentious topics more readily. They might circle-jerk, but at least the topics are brought up.

PC groups often avoid them all together.

EDIT:

&gt; When we started this conversation, you were talking about political correctness. You switched to critiquing censorship midway through our exchange. Of course I'm not pro-censorship, but that wasn't what we were originally discussing. You just conflated the two.

That's a fair distinction, but I've been exposed to places where that distinction starts to go away. It relies heavily on rule of law.

In populist, chaotic countries, there is almost no distinction between censorship by writte law and populist censorship. Regarding censorship and of what topics, most of the rules become implicit. People self-censor based on what they feel are mainstream/popular sensitivities. They are careful because if they break the implied rules, break public trust, and they can get shamed, ostracized, exiled, imprisoned, or even executed. It's not guaranteed, but it's not worth the risk. 

Public officials and law enforcement won't just punish you for breaking the law. They'll punish you to appease the public just to remain popular and for other corrupt reasons.

The distinction in the US is much clearer. Most people respect rule of law, and I can respect that. However, a nation's rule of law lies in a spectrum. Even here, there are conflicts we see everyday where many people/groups feel obligated to take the law into their own hands.

If PC or sensitive groups are self-censoring because they are afraid of losing their jobs or reputations, then there it isn't *that* much different from gov't censorship. The result is still that ideas (even evil ones) get buried."

People can certainly beat the $3.50 hypers, though you are not going to be making that much money with them. 

I think a 5% ROI is good for hypers, so $0.175 per game if you are good. Maybe you can play 20 per hour, that is $3.50 per hour (1 BI per hour)

This is only a rough guess though.



HU hypers are an interesting specialism, I think a lot comes down to open jamming, 3-bet jamming ranges, exactly what to 3-bet jam preflop 25bbs deep vs various opening ranges etc. I suspect HU hypers will at some point be cracked by computer power, stuff like what to 3bet jam and what to call a 3bet jam with at 25bbs / 22bbs /18bbs is going to be much easier to work out for a computer than stuff like how to play 200bb deep 6 max PLO.

I think that there is a guy called Pirus82 who is claiming to be making a living (just about) playing the $30 HU hypers. This is rare though.

Most of the pros are relying heavily on a huge amount of rakeback because at the $60s and above you are pushing such small edges.

I'm slightly worried about shitty skins and x86 devices (as is a majority of Lenovo's devices). 
But this is huge for Lenovo as it could allow them to break into US and Worldwide mobile devices with something that is popular. 

I'd like to be positive and say this exta cash from being part of Lenovo could be good, but seeing their track record I'd jump ship"

The wife knowingly made a decision to cheat on her husband (apparently without using protection).  Once she was pregnant she must have known there was a possibility the children weren't his, but she opted to bring the children to term.  The responsibility to raise and support the children should fall to the woman and the men she had affairs with, if she can't track down the real father then tough titties I say.  



As you said the guy unknowingly raised the children as his.  I don't think someone should have to (legally, what they choose to do personally is no concern to me) shell out money because they were lied too.  It's not like the man made a conscious decision to adopt a child, he was manipulated into raising these children as his own.

It isn't hard to make an audience hate a character, the simplest Lifetime Movie usually has a villain that makes you want to scream. Does that mean they're all well-written? No. Of course not. It's harder to take that character and make them complex, and have you question their motives. Fully develop them so that an audience's lasting impression wasn't ""Wow that guy was a dick"" but ""He was a dick, but he also had all these reasons for being that way and isn't that interesting.""

Cautiously_Curious,AskFeminists,1391035313.0,"&gt;Oh wow, I read this through a few times, and I finally figured out that you're talking about individuals, not ""Unwed/Non-Partnered People."" My bad.

*Oh...* Sorry about that!

&gt; All white people experience white privilege. No white person has ever been exempt from it. Many manifestations of privilege are not obvious in the moment, but privilege is always present.

I disagree. All white people, in the American context at least, have the potential to experience white privilege and probably have experienced it to varying degrees. Whether a single white person has ever experienced specific manifestations of the privilege or not is up in the air until you actually know the person. This is why interpersonal statements - and not an analysis of a political figure, a group or some such thing - about someone's privilege/non-privilege strikes me as inappropriate.

If we take it from this example; a woman who has experienced no sexism in her workplace would probably not deny that sexism exists against women in the workplace, but would also probably not take too kindly to someone insisting that she must have experienced sexism in her workplace.

Am I making sense?"

VoxMeretricis,sex,1391035320.0,"Well, one of my favorite topics! I am a PhD grad student of the Middle Ages, with a focus on gender, sexuality, and violence, so here's my take on sex in the Middle Ages:

First, you have to understand that the things we consider sexual and arousing today are in general not applicable to the Middle Ages. Nudity, for example - we have no evidence whatsoever that nudity was considered arousing. Instead, we have decent evidence that nudity was connected to feelings of shame. So, one thing you have to do is shed preconceived notions of what is sexually desirable. 

Second, there were many acts that were off limits. In response to another comment, it's untrue that sex was considered natural in the pre-Christian era and unnatural in the Christian. Sex within marriage was considered entirely nature - in fact, canon law dating from the 12th Century (specifically, Gratian) makes it clear that the conjugal duty ran *both* ways: wives were just as entitled to demand sex from their husbands as husbands were from their wives. It's just that legitimate sex consisted only of penetration - oral sex, anal sex, handjobs, masturbation: all these things fell under the category of sodomy (unlike today, in which anal sex is considered sodomy). Any type of illegitimate sex was sodomy. That's not to say things like oral sex didn't exist, but the evidence suggests it was very uncommon.

Third, shed your Victorian notions of ""frigid"" women. According to Aristotelian medicinal theories, women's humors were cold and wet, while men were hot and dry. The biological state of women, therefore, meant that they were naturally lustful and predisposed to unrestrained sexuality. This theory underlay many of the Church's later restrictions on women: the immense power of their sexuality was threatening because how could men possibly resist such sex-ravenous creatures? It is not true that women weren't supposed to enjoy sex - in fact, their (supposed) intense enjoyment of sex was just the problem! They liked sex so much, they had to be contained. 

For anyone interested in the topic, I recommend the excellent work: Sexuality in Medieval Europe: Doing Unto Others by Ruth Mazo Karras. It's a very accessible but academically sound piece of scholarship. "

I played WoW from open beta and got on release day.  Those first few days were laggy, buggy and awful.  Server queues, server timeouts, authentication problems, you couldn't loot, you couldn't move.  It was a mess.  

Back then, it was $60 to get WoW and $15 a month to play it.  I quit within three months after hitting max level within a week, doing the highest raids and getting burned out.  My husband (whom I didn't know back then) started playing WoW several months after it had adjusted to its growing pains.  He paid the $60 because other people said ""it's a good game"" and took his time leveling.

Anyway, if ESO proves to be a good game, word of mouth will carry the day. People will pay the $60 just to be able to play with their friends, or to check out what everybody else is jumping ship to from their old game.  They'll also likely do promos and free trials to entice people to play before opening up their wallets.  

So me, personally, I'm not worried.  I would gladly pay $60 if it's a good game, and I'm sure one way or another, I'll be able to try it before I buy."

Stryc9,worstof,1391035503.0,"&gt;Firstly, I won't be replying to you anymore. You're being incredibly confrontational and condescending.

Good. You have failed to read or understand anything I have written and haven't offered even a smidgen of interesting thought or rebuttal. I will just echo again how glad I am that people like you exist only in a small and mocked minority in this country.

&gt;Second, I seriously doubt anyone that drinks and drives is intending to hurt anyone. 

You really haven't read a damned thing I have written. Or you have perhaps the poorest reading comprehension on the planet. I never said that people that drink and drive intend to hurt anyone. I said that people that drink and drive are flagrantly reckless with the safety of others. This is not a complicated or difficult. I suppose you have to intentionally misunderstand this point because if you acknowledged it then you might have to admit your position is stupid and ill-thought out.

&gt;They're intending to get home. So yes, they have the same ""intent"" in your eyes as the person who drinks despite knowing he or she gets into fights when drunk.

No, that is easily differentiatable and you are a moron for not being able to see the difference. Everyone, without exception, is a hazard to everyone on the road when they drink and drive. Only a small minority of people fight when they drink. It is simple and infringes on no ones freedom to outlaw drinking and driving. You cannot on the other hand pass a law that applies only to people that fight when they drink.

&gt;And you're taking an extremely strict stance on such a common activity. I know tons of people who have families they support but maybe went to a ball game, had a few beers and got pulled over. What you're saying is these people and their families should suffer the consequences of losing their loved one for many years, losing their income (sometimes the only income of the household) as well as a felony status upon release preventing many employment options.

&gt;That seems pretty draconian to me.

If there's one thing I'd love to see, and I accept in the wider perspective it shouldn't matter, is that those over the park start to *fear us*, to *respect us*, to start to dread derby day.

We can finish above them in the league come the end of the season for year after year after year, but I don't think they will fear/respect/dread us.  It'll take many years, and quite a few trophies, before that happens.  And that is something I find unbelievably galling.

sgt0pimienta,gaming,1391035533.0,"Bethesda makes games a certain way, TES is a first person, singlepalyer, action/rpg fantasy game series, I'm not saying it shouldn't change, in fact, the games have changed a lot since they began and they have managed to keep that basic formula, going for another genre and developer is changing the gameplay too much for some to accept it as part of the same universe or series.

Maybe in your personal experience TES represents a theme, more than a series of games, and you wouldn't mind to play it in different kinds of genres because it's just that, a theme. For others, TES is also a specific sort of game of an almost unique genre that only Bethesda really makes, and going for a mmorpg spinoff that isn't even done by Bethesda means changing a lot of the things that make a TES game a TES game.

Someone is making a roast beef and chipotle salad, someone says ""hey... roast beef isn't a salad"" and the guy anwsers ""hey, salads have been around long enough, deal with it, things change"" TES + MMO is your roast beef/chipotle salad, it may taste delicious, it is still not a salad, and some people may prefer a salad, even a bad salad, when offered the rast beef/chipotle invention. (although in this case, TES salads are known to be exquisite)

No one ever said the series has to remain the same, I'm saying it should not be turned into a spinoff chain and that it should keep it's formula. And just because this is NOT a bethesda game it is more logical to wish/ask/discuss for the game to stay true to the series. Because it is uncertain wether it will turn out to be a TES themed stock mmo or and actual TES game."

Hell I didn't even notice that he was playing in one of them for more than 10 minutes, he simply wasn't tracking back at all to help while his team was not in possession.  That said, if a team has scored 2 goals in 4 matches they have played awfully.  I'm not saying Dempsey hasn't, but you can't blame just one player for dismal performance of a team.  

There's also a rather significant difference between one player playing well well on an underperforming team and one player playing poorly on a well performing team.  If one player was doing poorly he simply would be replaced since the team's in form.

Edit: Also I never actually said that he was at fault, just that I don't know much about his individual performance, but one would be hard pressed to argue that a team which scored 2 goals in 4 matches is in good attacking form so I'm not really sure where your little rant came from."

That is essentially my position. I think it's fine as long as people have plenty of options to provide for themselves, and if someone still chooses a wage labor contract that's their business.

In any case, anarchism means ""without rulers."" I don't think employing people necessarily makes one a ruler, though the relationship dynamic can turn that way in an economy such as ours where workers don't have many choices.

Also, I've read much of the book ""Markets not Capitalism"" as well as other content from C4SS and haven't found much to disagree with. It's just that that position seems to be along the lines of ""abolish the state and current corporate privilege, and wage labor will be unnecessary,"" which I'm fine with if that's what happens."

just_comments,funny,1391035875.0,"It has been a bit played out Hasn't it.

 I've noticed that the common practice on reddit is to find some sort of meme (comment or post) people like and then to repeat it until enough people don't enjoy it anymore (because they're tired of it). Then they wait for enough new users to come on the site so that they can get enough people think it's original to get a positive response. 

Some things don't seem to get played out that quickly (e.g. The old reddit switcharoo) others do, others die quite quickly (ridiculously photogenic guy). Some things seem to pop up occasionally (""calm the fuck down Satan"" responses to petty dickishness)

Things like this:

&gt;Then Fingolfin beheld (as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Oromë himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And Morgoth came.

That last sentence falls like thunder, man. Long, winding sentences full of repetition (**and** sounded his horn, **and** smote. . . **and** challenged. . .) and metaphor and simile, and then this short, sharp sentence when Morgoth, greatest of the Ainur, stirs from his black throne to take up the petty challenge of this Elven King. It builds up Fingolfin to this all-conquering hero, and then swiftly reminds you just exactly how far below Morgoth he is. Morgoth in that line doesn't come like fire, or with eyes as black as pits, or anything to compare to Fingolfin, because he is *not* comparable to Fingolfin. He is immeasurably greater."

acinomismonica,AskReddit,1391036103.0," people have different ideas as to what "" modest"" consist of and it also implies they are doing something dirty or sexual- breastfeeding is neither.  if a mother comes from a place that it isn't a taboo, then she won't think covering up is being modest, she'll think it's odd, not to mention annoying.  it doesn't make her immodest because again nothing about breastfeeding is inherently dirty, it's what society says it is and that's the issue. for some reason most of American society thinks it's dirty or sexual or that it is not modest so they should cover up, but that's the same as a Muslim man from the middle east telling an American girl that wearing jeans is dirty and they should dress "" modestly.""  the American girl isn't trying to be sexual or dirty, she's just wearing jeans.  should she then change her clothes to make the Muslim man happy, or should she say "" how  about you just look away?"""

In this case, earl doesn't spend as much time in Sherman's third anymore because he doesn't need to. Anyway, pff doesn't factor in context.

RsonW,AskReddit,1391036270.0,"The issue is that these things aren't inevitabilities. It's like a fucked-up lottery. The odds of an individual winning the lottery are astronomically slim, but no one is surprised that someone wins almost every week. Similarly, the odds of being robbed, raped, beaten, or murdered are slim; but we're not surprised when it happens.

So you say, ""Don't get blackout drunk because bad things can happen."" But you're ignoring that billions of people have gotten that drunk throughout history without anything bad happening. And that billions more have had bad things happen without having had a drop of booze in their system.

Let's take both alcohol and rape completely out of the discussion for a moment. Let's say you only carry and use cash. Someone mugs you and takes your entire paycheck. ""Ah, see, that's why you should use a bankcard."" So you do. Then a few moths later, someone hacks an ATM and steals your identity. ""Ah, see, that's why you should use cash.""

This is why victim-blaming is pointless. Hindsight is 20/20. And the hard pill for people to swallow is that there are bad people that want to do bad things. If they want to rob you, they'll do it. If they want to fuck somebody, they'll do it whether that somebody wants it or not. If they don't like you, they'll kill you. You can lessen your odds of being a victim, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's always possible despite any precautions. People yearn for the world to make sense and to have total control over their lives. But you're small. The world and its people go on with or without you. People are responsible for their own actions; you're not responsible for theirs. ""I saw that this girl was drunk. What was I supposed to do, *not* rape her? I mean, how would she learn her lesson not to get drunk?""

Which is why we have a justice system in the first place, because those types of people are an element we don't want in our society. Saying that the victim could have done *x*, *y*, and *z* doesn't help because, for one, they can't go back in time. And secondly (and most importantly), it all really boils down to, ""That's what you get for interacting with society."""

puaSenator,TheRedPill,1391036384.0,"Yeah, it's sounds cooler than it is. Basically, sister A started fucking her BF right there in the living room. Mind you, we are all pretty fucked up on molly. And sister B who is into me tells me it's no big deal. I go outside to talk to some other chick, and then sister B comes out a good 20 minutes later. She then tells me about her sex toys and how she wants to show them to me. I need to once again reinforce how fucked up I was at this moment, it was my Bday and have been going on hard for the past 24 hours. I literally met this group on the side of the street near a popular private beach club because I ran out of molly and wanted more. But anyways, so I just sort of follow her into her room and let her pull them out of the closet. I had no ""game plan"" or anything, other than I was just fucked up and wanted to see what turned out to be a giant fucking bag of sex toys. Literally, everything you can think of.

Anyways, she starts playing with them, essentially inviting me to get more aggressive by saying things like, ""I'm not good at doing this myself"". But again, so fucked up all the hints are going way above my head

She ends up going over to her post fucked sister and just starts ramming a dildo into her really hard. At this point, I'm not a fucking aspy so the situation is really fucking obvious, and this is my clear invitation. 

Interestingly enough, I just felt sick. I can't explain. It's a moment I've always wanted, but for some reason my gut was telling me this situation is just too much too fast. So I didn't do much other than just watch it all go down.

In retrospect, I was being a bitch and would definitely do things differently. However, it's not all tears. I did end up fucking sister B while her cute friend joined her during the Eurocup final in a upper class pub bathroom. At the time I didn't give a fuck because of the drugs, but in retrospect, everyone knew what we were doing and it was ridiculously rude. 

Like I said, I did damage abroad. I have a story from literally every weekend. "

I know it's a bitch.  We're the ""fat chicks"" for women, except we can't just go to the gym.

However, we can do things to make up for our height.

1) demographics:  go to the right places.  Look for the right girls.  I've found girls under 5'2"" and over 5'10"" tend to like me.  So I stick to them.  I also go places where girls like my style.

2) lower your standards:  It sucks that we can't get that crazy hot chick (despite people many times saying I look like Brad Pitt), but that's just the way it is.  Accepting the fact that a highly sought after girl is going to take Mr Tall Dark &amp; Hansom every time is extremely important.  It's reality.  If you're not living in reality, you're going to have a hard time.

3) self-improvement:  Although we can't hit the gym to grow, we are lucky that women are far more attracted to personality than body.  Work through your issues.  Become an emotional super-hero, where nothing damages you and you constantly ""save"" people.  Be funny.  Be social.  Improve your PUA skills.  You will find women are very receptive once you dive into self-improvement.


I wouldn't write off your friend just for telling you the truth.  If he was telling it to you for your benefit, he's actually a good friend.  If he was telling it to you so you'd back off, then you should have seen that happening and not broken frame.  Which of the two is the truth, I can't say.

pseudonomdeplume,AskReddit,1391036434.0,"Awesome! Studies like this are always likely to have conflicting results, as there's always gonna be problems with testing something through observation (experimenter bias), self reports (confirmation bias), or with applying animal behaviour to humans (I know rats are similar, though biopsych isn't my strongest subject). 

Chances are, there is probably a strong correlation (.4&lt;r&lt;1) between sugar and hyperactivity. Studies are obviously divided on whether we can infer causation from this, and I'm willing to bet that we'd both be able to have an awesome citation-battle to back both sides up, especially since sugar consumption in children is such a hot topic.

Those studies are really interesting, thank you for linking them!

Edit; The experimenter bias would be a helluva lot less likely exist in a double blind study, like the one you posted, so I reckon individual differences between participants might be playing a part in the differing results. That makes no sense, but I'm tired!"

RJ815,changemyview,1391036449.0,"If lying never had a justifiable purpose, lying probably wouldn't have been an evolutionary development. Sure, lying is often used to boost oneself to the detriment of others, but generally that kind of deceit can only last so long before it backfires as it exhausts goodwill others may have for you. Lying in order to preserve life is understandable, if not necessarily ""moral"", and that's why it can be ""okay"". The problem is that situations where lying is advantageous but not really justifiable are more common than lying in terms of survival and stuff. So, justified lying is probably a rare event compared to the lying that most will be familiar with.

I don't know if this helps at all, but hopefully it does."

I see this, not as something that LGBT, queer, feminist, etc groups are specifically guilty of.

But I see this as something that people NEWLY EXPOSED to these, and other, groups are frequently guilty of.

Usually, after someone has adopted whatever trait or habit or thought more fully, it is just background noise in their personality. It's no longer something they are constantly thinking out, or just finding relief in beginning to express.

They *seem* to hang around and not shut up. But that's *IME* because there are always new people learning some new philosophy, ideal, or stating their identity.

And another thing that most people fail to realize is that science is completely happy with experiments ""failing"" It's alright to state that chanting the *gayatri mantra* a 108 times precisely at sunrise for a month can ""improve"" your life, set up an experiment, and find that nothing happens if you do it.

It's like not finding the Higg's Boson. That's still a major discovery. The problem lies in the creaky infrastructure of the Indian education system that forbids ""out of box"" thinking, and even if it tries to foment it, it's relegated to textbooks with solutions that students ""study"" fervently before exams, to vomit the answers, and forget the intent.

I watched a documentary [Ayurveda: the art of being](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5lD6eCF_I) and in it the director interviews an IISc scientist who explains that in cell line studies, a certain bark/root/herb was found to cure leukemia.

jemzinthekop,soccer,1391036632.0,"After watching this match it is evident Chelsea do not have what it takes to win matches consistently without shooting brilliance from their midfield. Players like Oscar and Hazard are incredible and can create so much, but Eto'o and Ba are walking calamities and as crazy as it is for me to say, I think Torres is their only striker with a chance of netting anything that isn't a sitter. 

I'm interested to see how Willian will pan out because for all the hype, most of what I've seen of him is just a guy dancing around the ball and not really doing much beyond that. I think Gary Cahill is the glaring weak player on the pitch though and I would try to exploit him at every opportunity. 

In tonight's match Chelsea simply couldn't break down a relatively talentless back four and relied on long shot after long shot which failed to inspire. Chelsea also really seemed to lack any spark tonight although that rain looked like a total drag to play in. 

On the other side, West Ham are a disaster on offense and as I said in a previous comment, this was the worst offensive performance I've ever seen in any level of football. Hammers will end the season in relegation if they can't figure out how to string 3 passes together. They defensive performance deserves all the accolades they have received here and around the web though as they acted tirelessly the whole game. 

All in all a fun game to watch but I certainly didn't see a Premier League Winner on that pitch tonight. "

That's probably fair, although I'm guessing you consider me a part of that. Let's see.

&gt;Consoles make development cycles more predictable and make creating content easier in iterations.

Why? I want to understand how that helps.

&gt;There is a reason the bulk of the talent prefers to work at console-centric studios.

Go on...

&gt;The fact you don't realize the benefits of HSA + GDDR5 is just evidence towards your ignorance. Yes, it is the same memory, but it is the system memory. So much processing time on PC is wasted because the CPU has to copy bits from System or GPU memory. And that is something developers have to assume is the case until HSA (or the like) are adopted across the board.

I didn't realise you were also referring to HSA. With regards to that: I don't know, frankly. 

&gt;This is furthered by the fact that AMD's APU design is fully capable of simultaneous reads and writes to the memory, using multiple memory controllers. Even the 'low end' APU in the PS4 is easily capable of maxing out the memory bandwidth in the PS4. This is good because it means the CPU can cache tasks and instructions to memory rather than flushing local cache, thereby decreasing wasted clocks and, at the same time, dropping latencies. Lower latencies means dynamic and fluid simulations can be run, iteratively, faster. Faster than any CPU on PC can do since PC is locked to hilariously low memory throughput and high latencies.

That all sounded plausible until the last bit. High latencies? GDDR5 is very high latency. I must be missing a step. 

&gt;GPGPU. Ever heard of it?

Yes. I'm questioning how the system knows what to put to the GPU and what not to. Probably a simple question. Just curiosity. No need to be rude. 

&gt;Because the PS4 is a homogenous platform with direct hardware access for developers, the overhead present in PC (time wasted doing driver/api tasks that are only required because OS / APIs are too high level) grows somewhat exponentially.

Exponentially is an exaggeration.

&gt;Developing a PC game for the 'bulk' of PCs means lots of engineering time and money spent making it run on a wide range of drivers / systems. This usually means lowest common denominator determines the top tier limitations. All of that means the overall experience is lowered. This is one of the reasons PC exclusive high budget titles really don't look as good as one would hope. They look good, but it feels like they haven't gotten that much better. This is because the low end on PC keeps getting dragged along like an elephant carcass behind a sports car.

Have you not played Crysis 3? 

I mean, it's either this or we get bogged down for years like we did with the last two consoles, and that'll surely happen again."

Parkwaydrivehighway,teenagers,1391036821.0,Hi...
Wiskie,college,1391036827.0,"Speaking as a STEM major who indulges in numerous Liberal Arts Classes, I will try to give you some of my peers' common perspectives:

1. **""Liberal Arts is easy.""** This is common among hard scientists. There are engineering and computer science classes that myself or my roommates have been in where the average exam scores are, like, 30% -- and it's not for lack of effort that people score this low. These same people perceive liberal artists to have multiple choice tests and papers to turn in where it's probably less labor-intensive to get a good grade. These people will say that truly learning H-NMR spectroscopy is infinitely more difficult than learning the dates of major battles in WW2.

2. **""Liberal Arts are useless.""** Across the STEM (and business/finance) spectrum, liberal arts is seen as indulging (and I think that's a good word) in something that ultimately offers very little society and therefore, deservedly, results in smaller paychecks. How much will you pay for a working car or a doctor's life-saving surgery? How much will you pay for language lessons or a paper on Karl Marx? 

3. **""Liberal Arts majors think they're smarter than they are.""** I've known many STEM majors who were better artists, musicians, and writers than their liberal arts counterparts. I've known STEM majors who know more about obscure philosophical topics than some liberal arts majors. It does get annoying to be told that you ""haven't considered the consequences of your actions through a liberal arts lens"" when you're trying to perform an experiment. Believe me, scientists are capable of appreciating (and even creating) art and written literature same as LA people. As long as you're not stuck up this shouldn't apply to you.

4. **""Liberal Arts people are weird/alternative.""** I don't know that I agree with this, but the stereotypical serious, debonair doctor, stone-faced and logical engineer, and the suited-up, classy businessman often fly in stark contrast to the stereotypical brooding english major, starry-eyed philosopher, or stoner/punk art major. I'm not kidding when I say there are some scientists who see absolutely no appeal in old art, history, and literature and just want to be left to their functions and computations save for a videogame respite now and again. I think this is sad because even though I'm a Genetics major, I *love* history, art and writing, but it's the way it is. As I said in #3, not everyone is like this, but it's true that some are.

When I was thinking about what I wanted to do, my dad always said, ""do whatever you want, but have a *plan* to make a living from it, and then execute that plan. If you want to study history, find a way to do it that you can live of off -- writing books, giving talks etc."" What I realized was, I loved history, but I didn't want to write books or give speeches or teach. So as passionate as I was about it, if I wanted to make a living, I'd have to pick something different.

As I said, I still ""indulge"" in LA classes. I'm taking a drawing class right now and I love it, but I have to keep my future in perspective too."

Armor reduces damage by a flat amount rather than a %, so if I do 90 damage and their armor reduces 80 then I will only do 10 damage. However if you upgrade your damage by just 10, you double the amount of damage you do to that enemy. There are also some bosses that have pretty low health but (relatively) high armor, so bringing an upgraded heavy weapon can kill them in just a couple hits whereas smaller weapons take much longer to kill them. IIRC the armor damage reduction formula is **approximately** just 1/2 of your armor, so if you have 200 armor then damage is reduced by 100."

Tod has been your best friend since first grade, you were at his wedding, you are the god father of his child. Tod is at the club right now, dancing with women and getting plastered. His wife wants to know where he is. He asked you not to tell her. You don't know if Tod is going to cheat on her tonight or not, but you do know he is out flirting and it would really destroy her to find out.Your instincta probably tell you to lie for him. But how could that possibly have a good result? Even if she never finds out, if it okay to let Tod go out and fool around? Is that even going to be good for Tod, who you know loves this woman despite what he is doing tonight? No. Tod's wife deserves to know, and a lot of pain and suffering will be saved by telling her now. Who knows, maybe because of this Tod and his wife will be able to bring more excitement into their marriage, knowing that he is getting restless, and fix the problem before it turns into an affair.The problem is, fourth graders dont understand either of those situations. Its really tempting to just teach them never to lie, ever, because in most situations that we see them getting into its better for then not to lie. But you can't do that. You have to teach them the gray areas too. Ni, you shouldn't lie to your parents about whether or not you e done your homework. No, you shouldn't lie to your friends about whether or not someone took their toy. Yes, you should absolutely lie to a stranger in the park who asks if you're all alone, and then you should go get a responsible adult to protect you. Of course, then its up to you to teach them the difference between the stranger who is asking them to pet the puppies in his van or the responsible adult who is watching her children in the park. Because we all know that not everyone who appears to be safe actually is."

speedisavirus,politics,1391036993.0,"I don't know. I've done alright even with the student loans I now have but I'm not everyone. Even when I wasn't making a lot of money. Learning what one can do without for the sake of the future is a skill I see lacking a lot these days. 

I was able to meet all my needs on under 16k a year before I had those loans. Now I have them I live well since I didn't go to school for something with little chance of landing a lucrative job. It sucked and I was definitely what would be considered impoverished. I ate ramen. Had up to 3 roommates at times. Worked on average 2-3 part time jobs in order to make ends meet. Didn't have cable. Didn't have a car. Had a super cheap burner phone. 

Now, I that last paragraph was stated for the following reason. I find myself irritated when I hear someone complaining about their wage but they still have cable, a brand new fruit phone with a $100 a month plan, go out partying, and wear name brand clothing. Many people really need to realize that most of those nice things aren't a right. They are a privilege.   

Here are my positions on this, especially student loans. There are far too many people studying unemployable degree paths. Back in the day, ancient Greece and up to somewhat recent times studying certain things were pursuits of the well to do. Studying art, literature, etc. The rest of the people had to learn practical skills. They were farmers, cobblers, and potters. 

The same really is true today. No one should go into debt for a degree that does not show a promising career path. If you are from a well to do family go for it. Otherwise, either learn a trade or pick a degree that has good career prospects. Spending $40k studying art history is not likely to pay the bills. It could at one point but things are reverting to the time of yore. 

Of course you can do it all right and still get screwed so who knows. I'm not saying we don't need reforms, we definitely do, but there are plenty of people that own a part in there shortcomings as well.

ThePinkPanther2,AskWomen,1391037004.0,"Spare parts? Extra bra expander? Instead of throwing out old bras, snip off the hook tab. When one of your newer bras have a broken hook, swap it out. Same goes for underwire and bra straps that need replacement parts. 

A lure?  Say you plan a strip tease/special night for your SO and you really want to build up the anticipation. So you blatantly leave it out on the front door knob so he knows to enter the bedroom (and to get him excited) instead of immediately sitting down at the  computer to start a WoW raid or boss fight. 

A hamper hammock? You have too many clean socks that have to be put away, but you can't carry them all on one trip upstairs. Put the rolled up socks into the bra hammock and *viola*, saves you from searching for a laundry hamper and making two trips.

Yes, I get off on using him how I want, because I know what feels good for me and the best way to do it.  I know what my body wants and when, and so if I'm in control I can make myself as good as it is possible to make myself feel.  This also takes the pressure off of him to perform, and I'm in control of who orgasms when.  It has made sex less stressful and more enjoyable since I started being more dominant.

Secondarily, and the part that turns me on, is knowing how good I am making him feel.  Nothing turns me on more than reducing him to an incoherent, moaning, drooling mess who can't walk afterwards, and knowing that I'm the reason why.  It helps to have a very vocal partner."

That would be like saying hipsters have mental problems. Even if gender dysphoria is unusual, by labeling it as a disorder that implies that we should correct it by forcing people to accept their biological sex, when the more humane solution is to allow transgender people to identify the way they feel. Other disorders like depression or OCD clearly harm your function regardless of whether you choose to seek help. Gender dysphoria, however, is only a problem because other people make it a problem by harshly judging transgender people. 
To me, that's like saying it would be a mental disorder for a white person to be interested in black culture, surround themselves with black friends, etc. Just because the norm is for people to interact mostly with people of their own ethnicity doesn't mean that it's wrong for one to defy this norm, like it doesn't harm anyone, it just disturbs close-minded people.

She *might* be open to you finding other women to satisfy your kink, but I wouldn't expect it. Some people can handle that sort of thing, but most can't. It's hard to feel like you're the most important person in your partner's life when they need to get such an intimate need met by someone else.

Maybe I'm looking too far into it, but this is definitely not how he has been depicted in Oblivion so maybe there is something deeper going on there? Or maybe it's not even Mannimarco but just a strong Dremora (maybe a Lich?)..but he did turn the Breton into a zombie in an odd fashion and was immune to his sword so that doesn't seem likely.

If you're going to tan then I'd suggest using a small spf lotion like spf 10 or 12 and still reapplying every 2 hours. Moisturizing after is also very important. Nothing in life is ""safe"" and the important thing is to minimize risks. If skin cancer runs in your family then I'd suggest giving up your dreams of being a bronzed goddess since you're genetically predisposed, but if you really want to tan then do it smart and realize that there are still medical risks involved. Any amount of tan = sun damage since that's literally what's happening to your skin, it's being damaged which causes it to produce more melanin which is the body's natural sunscreen."

fnredditacct,changemyview,1391037741.0,"In theory, I'm with you all the way. And it is what I personally try to do, and feel responsibility to do. 

However, in practice it can be really difficult, and there are factors outside of my control that affect my ability to do so.

There are so many different factors that go into all those different cases, that trying to think about them all ahead of time, or list them out, just isn't possible. I can't predict them all for myself and every potential guy I could meet, and I certainly can't try to predict them for others.  Which means that I *should absolutely* do my best to explain, however good a job that may be. And also that I *shouldn't be required to explain* because I might not be able to, or feel safe to.

And that's assuming that the guy is a guy that will listen to me.
""No means no"" sets such a hard line, that when it's crossed, it's clear that it's crossed.  And he can't pretend like he didn't just do that. Because, we have a saying ""no means no.""

I really think the solution is for people to discuss sex **before** anything happens.  Thoroughly. What their experience levels are, safer sex practices, what they like and don't like, hard limits, how they like to go about starting sex, how to bring issues up if they arise, triggers, etc.  And then they can make a safeword that REALLY MEANS NO. I pretty much think everyone should have a safeword.  (BOTH people should have safewords. NOT just the woman or person in submissive position. The man or person in dominant position also has every right to stop all activity without having to provide an explanation in that moment.)

*edit: A series of safewords is best. I use: Yellow =  pause, slow down, need a break/breather; Red = STOP something is wrong; Black: everything stops, this is done*

But if that doesn't happen, No has to mean No. 

There has to be *some word* that means everything is done and explanation is not necessary. Because there are cases in which such a word is needed. And ""No"" is currently that chosen word by the public.

**USEFUL EDIT**: **I didn't address the point of what I think should happen after ""no"" or after a safeword, as I recommended**

What to do when someone safewords is something needs to be addressed in the beforehand talk, if there is one. This would vary from person to person.

In the event of not having this talk and using safewords:
I think the safest thing for the guy to do, *(for himself)*, is to completely stop whatever was happening, breaking physical contact and move out of her space. Then ask her if she is okay. *react to response* Then ask if she wants to talk about it.  If she says no, then drop it, totally and not initiate again while in person.  If she initiates again, make her tell him, in words, that she want to move forward, and that whatever was wrong isn't wrong anymore. For his own protection. And he doesn't have to agree to continue forward at all. After that encounter is over *if they didn't continue*, when she is not there physically, I completely believe he has every right to ask, ""What happened? How should we handle this moving forward? Do you want to move forward?"" If she can't provide answers, then that is something she needs to work on. If she won't, then perhaps she's trying to spare his feelings, maybe she thinks there is some future danger from him, but I think more than likely she's being immature.

*edit: the more I think about it, the more I think I would make talks like this and establishing safewords mandatory if I became magic and powerful enough to do so.*

*editedit: I really with I could be magic. And powerful. That would rule.*

*Sorry for all the edits. Just trying to get it right*"

The facilities guy ensures we're stocked with supplies at least once a year, usually in the fall, and then double checks before potential chaos. We've got pillows, blankets, some basic toiletries, non-perishable food, flashlights, and other stuff. There're a couple of couches people can sleep on and plenty of floor space if the couches are occupied. There's also a shower. We've got bags of stuff for ice prevention for everything outside.

wordserious,explainlikeimfive,1391037756.0,"On Linux, the kernel maintains an entropy pool that pulls randomness from things like clock drift, key presses, mouse movements and others. Random numbers are available by reading /dev/random. If there is not enough randomness in a system (for instance on a server that never actually gets key strokes), then /dev/random will block the operation until it can get more numbers. /dev/urandom, on the other hand, will use math to generate pseudo-random numbers based on a known algorithm, if the entropy pool is empty.

You can see the difference if you cat /dev/random and /dev/urandom.

At my work we run systems that need actual random numbers in more volume than the entropy pool can provide, and we use specialized hardware for that. Essentially, it's a USB device that gets numbers from things like thermal noise, quantum effects on transistors, and cosmic ray hits."

ForceofBillions,survivor,1391037836.0,"* Golden Age: 1-7. Survivor at its most pure and basic form. It was fresh, it was popular, and it was fun. Great seasons that may not have the same level of strategy that we know of today, but it laid the groundwork for what the show is now. All fans at least appreciate this era.

* Experimental Age: 8-14. Survivor feels different. They try new gimmicks and ideas such as returning players, final threes, and idols. You can see the show evolving...a few good seasons, and a few awkward seasons. Not the show's worst era, but far from its peak.

* The Renaissance: 15-20. Survivor feels fun and relevant again. We have a string of great seasons (minus Samoa) and strategy is seen like it never has been before. Things are working and the show feels like real Survivor again...just like it was in the Golden Ages.

* The Dark Ages: 21-24. A streak of average to poor seasons. Survivor at its absolute worst. Strategy and casting is boring, and we get the exact opposite of what we want. Some new twists are played with, but none of them work well. Definitely a sad time for Survivor fans.

* The Reconstruction: 25-Present. Survivor keeps trying new ideas, but they're actually starting to work. Some solid seasons that make us feel like it's a second Renaissance, but we're still reminded that some of the problems of the Dark Ages are still carried over (Uneven editing, some poor casting choices, etc.). Survivor isn't at its prime yet, but it's  starting to get there again. "

People submit their reviews and then the editors pick out which is best sometimes.  Bigger games will have tons of reviews while smaller ones won't.  They only have to pay the people for each review.  Although I might be wrong since I've never worked for IGN.  I might have been lied to on that."

1) As we don't have a concrete answer provided by G-d to this in our texts, this is one of many speculations we have about the afterlife. I like this idea personally because it holds you accountable but ultimately shows that G-d is El Rahamim. 

2 a) I think Palestine should exist because I believe the Palestinian people have a right to self determination as do any other people on the planet. Where it should exist, under which borders... and how should it be established and administered... I think those can be earnestly debated among reasonable people provided both are willing to compromise. 

I also think Israel has the absolute right to exist as a sovereign Jewish state, and to protect its people and its borders, as is the responsibility of all governments everywhere.

Sigh_No_More,AskWomen,1391038032.0,"I think there are a lot of people out there (men and women) who just don't like being independent.

This kind of lifestyle is much easier to achieve as a woman in our society, and there are plenty of men who actually LIKE women like that. So while men are more likely to be pressured to suck it up and deal with it, women who really don't want to be independent often have the option to find someone who wants a ""traditional"" woman. 

I don't have any sources or anything for this, but I have met people like this, and it makes much more sense to me than ""I don't want any rights because I'm a woman and I don't deserve them"" (although I'm sure there are plenty of people who think that way too).

&gt; Tim Miles helped a #Huskers fan propose to his girlfriend. This man is a fucking genius. http://youtu.be/dwanOo_Qb0o 

&gt; Miles key: does image/PR stuff *during the season*. Bo is as good at it, but disregards it until off-season, when people aren't watching.

&gt; Jack Hoffman, broken phone prank, tweeting @FauxPelini - all fantastic PR/image moves. All off-season. During season? ""Process. Execute.""

&gt; Tim Miles on the other hand: tweets during actual games. Not because he has time/leeway, because he understands image.

&gt; Bo's funny. Good personality. Meathead shit-flipper, can deliver a line. But he pretends he doesn't need it. And as Miles proves, he does.

&gt; Why does this matter? Because if #Huskers Football brand is going to wake up, the CEO needs to be invested in it, believe in it.

fiat_lux_,TheRedPill,1391038063.0,"&gt; The second question, is there something about Anglo (english speaking) culture specifically that causes the behaviors and situations discussed on this forum. I often hear things are better in Eastern Europe, Asia or Latin America. Why would things be better in a non-English speaking country?

I've found a lot of the stereotypes to be close to truth in this regard. I wouldn't say it's ""better"" overall, because they tend to be a lot worse socioeconomically.

However, when I look to Eastern Europeans and Asians, they don't care for gender politics, and generally much more conservative in that regard. There's a lot of reasons I've gleaned. One example is their war torn histories: men being killed (for some age ranges, up to 4 out of 5 Russian men were wiped out in ww2), lack of eligible bachelors, mothers sharing their experiences with their daughters... Not sure how far that trauma passed along, since it's been awhile, but that's where some of the stereotype comes from at least where I was from.

Another is the life expectancy (male life expectancy is about 12 years shorter than female life expectancy). You'll see similar numbers from other ex-soviet states like Ukraine and Belarus. It's related to alcoholism/depression among other factors. It's just hard to find ""a good man"". 

Another is just their religion. 

For Asians, it's a bit different. But there's still that element of traditionalism. For poorer Asians, like Chinese and SEA ones, it has a lot to do with socioeconomics. ""Hypergamy"" (the standard definition involving ""marital social mobility"", not the TRP one) is accepted and even encouraged there. 

Those are just a few I've looked into, but I'm sure others have more to add.

So I wouldn't focus *just* on the language aspect (Anglo vs non Anglo). The language barrier was a problem, but it's not like the First and Second World were open to most of each other's ideas when modern feminism took off.

If you *do* want to focus specifically on the language facet and how it might relate to people's way of thinking, it's very complicated, but one place you can start is on the Eastern vs Western dichotomy between East Asian cultures and Western (liberal democratic) ones. Prof Richard E Nesbitt is a foremost expert on the matter so his works should help."

Here's [a quote from Susan B. Anthony](http://books.google.com/books?id=bRIpYIQqYC8C&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=mankind+women&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VovpUojgKtPlyAGtuIHQCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&amp;q=mankind%20women&amp;f=false), for instance:

&gt;When a Charter declares ""all men born free and equal,"" it means, intends, and includes all women, too; it means all mankind, and this is the *legal interpretation* of the language.

jaynay1,leagueoflegends,1391038145.0,"Thank you for actually answering my argument.  You successfully followed reddiquette and contributed to discussion.  Thus, I will actually upvote your post as people are supposed to do.

And now, I will rebut it, because I don't fully agree with it, and because that's how this system is supposed to work.

I don't think Frost's pickban was that good to start with, outside of that they would pick very good 5v5 comps.

But I also think that teams have stopped giving them the 5v5 midgame teamfights they used to win and turn games about on.  That is the major crux of my argument and because teams are able to force objectives quickly, Frost heavily loses the ability to contest those with a 5v5.

I also believe that their teamfighting isn't as unique any more -- other teams have risen that teamfight as well or better, but that doesn't necessitate a drop in the quality of Frost's.  Hence why Frost can still easily make it out of groups but still struggles against stronger teams.  Ozone for example is one of the best teams at forcing teams out of 5 man situations, and they 3-0ed.  Xenics Storm, similarly, was a strong laning team that was very good at rolling that into 5v5 advantages due to the strength of Arrow.  They split with Frost because Frost is still, ultimately, good enough at teamfighting.

I think the major thing is that I presume weakness in teams in S2 because it was the early stages of the game.  People have learned a ton since then, to the extent that I don't think the CLG team that made it to worlds would have been in the top 10 NA anymore.  Similarly, if the Frost team that was at worlds had been in the modern Korea, they wouldn't have made it into OGN.  The game has just improved and players have gotten so much better since then."

Full stop. The very promotion of inaction to an obvious wrong is something I saw my entire life in school, in the military, and afterwards. It's one thing if there was an apology or an acknowledgement of poor behavior but then an honest change. But to continue that behavior while accepting an award shows an utter lack of integrity and they are rewarding him for it.

EDIT: Reading more into it I am shocked to see so many people agreeing to keep quiet. This suggests there is a fundamental problem regarding ""whistleblowing"" (for lack of a better word) on fellow scouts. The same attitude exists in the world of law enforcement and while they are very far apart in comparison, I would imagine the retaliation and eventual stigmatization is just as bad."

Zulban,TrueAtheism,1391038354.0,"It depends on what you mean by religion. To me religion is collective superstition. So you need groups that identify themselves as belonging to that religion, and then a set of beliefs which are unfalsifiable. In that case, yes.

There's a ton of ways religion spreads, and they all appear to be in terminal decline.

* Language like ""shepherd"" and ""flock"" are no longer meaningful metaphors to us, because who now has even seen a flock lately? So the literature is less effective.
* The comfort of fictional paternity and maternity like ""our father"" or ""mother goddess"" is being replaced by reliable social institutions.
* Science has very confidently answered many things that holy books claim to explain.
* A cathedral used to be the largest man made structure people would ever see, now we have space stations and the [hubble deep field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field). Humans are experiencing secular awe more and more.
* Levels of wealth and education have a huge say on whether someone will be religious. The internet especially is cleaning up for education, and although there exist huge inequalities today, it is certainly not as hard to have food and shelter. And reasonable medical care, even for the peons, unless you live in the USA. 

I'm not sure if individual unfalsifiable superstitions will ever truly disappear (without modifying the human species) because I think they are symptoms of human creativity and insanity. Our brains seem hard wired to be a little irrational for the next fifty thousand years at least (unless we change ourselves), but the religious institutions we see today are not going to survive."

They were best friends through their whole lives, and when the bullmastiff ended up falling through the ice of their swimming pool and drowning, the Rottweiler would sit at the spot he fell in and wouldn't go anywhere else until she passed away not too long after.

This means that publishers, with the exception of Microsoft Game Studios (who to be honest have no excuse), will be reluctant to give MS titles for the promotion unless it can be used for promotional purposes for an upcoming game (ie. Dead Rising 2, Assassin's Creed 2).

### Overview

---

1. Leona is a versatile support who synergizes with every ADC in the game.
1. Leona has **incredible burst**, **incredible peel**, **great engage**, **good damage**, **no sustain**, **no disengage**, and **no poke**.
1. There is no one ""correct"" play-style for Leona; it depends *partially* on your personal style and *mostly* on the matchup in laning phase and teamfights.

### Understanding Leona's Passive, ""Sunlight""
---
Leona's burst relies on having a teammate to proc as many of her passive buffs as possible.

 At Level 2, Leona's passive does 20 damage per proc. With 98 Q damage (40 base + 58 AD since it's an autoattack reset), 60 E damage, and 58 AD, that's 40 + 20 + 60 + 20 + 58 = 198 damage from Leona alone. For comparison, Sona has 380HP at Level 1 and 450HP at Level 2. 

 This is why Leona's Level 2 all-in is so infamous: if you are laning with a Lucian who starts with a Doran's Blade and ~14 AD from Runes &amp; Masteries, the damage looks like this: Leona E (60) + Leona Auto (58) + Lucian Auto (60) + Leona Passive (20) + Leona Q (98) + Lucian Q (80) + Leona Passive (20) + Leona Auto (58) = **454** damage before resistances.

That's enough to 100-0 a Level 1 Sona, and it requires only *one autoattack* and *one ability* from the marksman.

When you hit level 3 and 6, now you have 4 opportunities to proc Leona's passive. At Levels 5 and 6, her passive deals 50 damage per proc, which means that if you chain your abilities correctly, that is **200 extra damage** on top of the ~500 Leona's full rotation is already going to deal.

### Understanding Leona's W, ""Eclipse""
---

It's tempting to hit W in the bush and time it so it goes off as soon as you land from your E. If this will secure a kill, do it, but if you're engaging on full-health or near-full-health opponents, **don't activate Eclipse until you *start* getting focused**. This **maximizes the amount of time you benefit from the vital bonus MR + Armor** provided by the ability, which you *are* maxing first, right?

This also gives your Marksman a greater window to proc all three or four of your passive buffs: if you W + E + Q before your Marksman is even in range, **you are leaving 100 free damage on the table**.

### Leona's Play-Style
---

Don't think of Leona as an ""aggressive"" support. **There is no such thing as an ""aggressive"" support**. There are only supports with great engage or great poke, and so on.

Leona is considered ""aggressive"" because she has good damage, incredible burst and great engage, but that doesn't mean you *must* play her aggressively; in fact, against lanes with incredible disengage (Janna/Ezreal), laning phase might end up being a farm-fest.

For example, take Leona/Lucian vs. Sona/Ashe.

Sona and Ashe are going to be poking a lot, then using their ults to engage when you're low. They don't want to engage at full health because their burst damage isn't high enough, but they're going to poke aggressively.

Leona and Lucian have no sustain and inferior poke, but almost unparalleled hard engage and burst. To go even in lane, they need to stay clear of Sona's poke. To stomp lane, Lucian needs to be in position to follow Leona in, because Leona should punish Sona's poke by jumping on her every time. The agreement between Sona and Leona is ""I won't kill you if you don't try to poke me.""

### How Marksman Synergy Determines Play-Style
---

Q: **How do I use Zenith Blade**?  
A: To punish enemies who are out of position.
===
Q: **What constitutes ""out of position""**?  
A: It depends on your marksman and the enemy duo.
===

**All Marksmen**: Taking turret aggro when diving, diving PAST you and ON to your Marksman.

**Marksmen with dashes/blinks**: Close enough for your Marksman to dash in and unleash a full rotation before the snare/stun from your E - Q or E - Q - R combo wears off.

**Marksmen with ranged poke or ults**: At low health, close enough for your Marksman to use their abilities to force a flash or secure the kill.

For example, you can dive all day with Ezreal, but if you're laning with a Varus, you can't really use your E to dive unless either A.) they're low-health enough that they'll die to your passive + Varus Q, B.) Varus is already far forward enough to follow up on your dive, or C.) you and Varus are on the same page and he's ready to blow his ult to so he can catch up and finish them off while you chain CC them with your own ult.

### Getting Countered
---

Leona takes effort to counter, so don't AFK in fountain as soon as you see that Janna pick. Here's what you should look out for:

## Taric
**How he counters Leona**: ""You do damage, Leona? That's cute. So do I."" When you dive their Marksman, Taric waltzes right past you and unleashes his E + AA + W + AA + Q + AA combo on your Marksman, and he doesn't need any teammates to proc his passive for bonus damage, so he's probably going to outdamage you.  
**What to do as Leona**: Bait him into blowing his stun on you, and engage his Marksman. Bait him into blowing his W, which means he loses his armor bonus, and lock him down while your Marksman chunks him.

## Janna
**How she counters Leona**: ""Go ahead and dive. See how that works out for you."" Pro Jannas will knock you out of your E with instant-release Jannados. You are required to AFK in fountain if this happens. Janna will shield her Marksman when you dive, nullifying your initial burst, and will use her slow to prevent you from landing your stun, or will target your Marksman to isolate them and waste your passive procs while her own Marksman tears into you with the bonus AD from her shield.  
**What to do as Leona**: Wait for them to get cocky or impatient and punish them for it. If they're too smart for that, eat a slice of humble pie and just try to zone them a little while your Marksman farms.

## Alistar
**How he counters Leona**: ""Gosh. How'd you end up on the other side of OUR turret?"" Alistar will headbutt you away from his Marksman, or worse, turn a near-dive into First Blood by Qing you when you land, walking behind you and headbutting you over his turret. If you don't burst down his Marksman, he'll heal back the chip damage and hit you hard when you haven't recovered yet.  
**What to do as Leona**: Honestly I have no clue. Every time I lane against an Alistar they're either an unstoppable God who is always in the right place at the right time and stops every single one of my dives, or they are clearly a rock on a keyboard and I would win lane no matter what champion they're playing.

### Build
---

I use these runes:

Armor: + 25.5  
Armor Pen.: + 7.2  
Magic Resist: + 6.7  
Magic Resist / Level: +0.59 (10.68 @ 18)  
Magic Pen.: + 4.9  
Crit. Chance: +0.93%

That's Armor Seals, Armor Quints, Hybrid Pen Reds + 1 Crit Chance Red, 5 Flat MResist Glyphs and 4 Scaling MResist Glyphs.

If you're feeling squirrely, swap out the Armor Quints for AD Quints and let the hijinks ensue.

For masteries I go 10/17/3, taking AD, Double-Edged Sword, CDR and Expose Weakness in Offense; HP, Armor, Perseverance and Runic Blessing in Defense, and +1.5% movement speed in Utility.

I always start Runic Shield, and buy Targon's, Doran's Shield, Boots, Sightstone depending on how much cash I have when I go back, then usually rush a Sunfire, but sometimes opt for a different defensive item depending on the matchup.

yemeson,nba,1391038540.0,"The difference isn't as big as $12M/year vs. $4M/year would suggest, but I gotta say West is definitely better than Scola. 

Offensively, they're really pretty similar (one reason why Scola works out great for us). Both can work the low or high post pretty well, make midrange shots, and are great passers for their position. The only difference really is Scola's craftiness vs. West's physicality, but they both have about the same overall ability. I gotta say, I'd prefer the physicality in the starting lineup because I feel like it makes people more tired. For example, I'm always happy when I see LeBron James guarding David cause he is constantly physical with him. It might just be a placebo, but I feel like it takes away from LeBron's offensive play a bit when he's bumping with David West all day on defense. Plus, it just fits the attitude of the team better. 

Defensively, I'm under the impression that David is better than Luis. Scola has surprised me because his D is way better than I thought we were getting when we made the trade. The difference isn't much, but I'd definitely prefer West on this end. Scola does have peskier hands and hustles a ton, but David's D is better overall. 

Just had to say that, but, like your comment, it's just my opinion. Either way, it's great having both of them on the Pacers. "

There is information being spread that mercury is being put in vaccinations as a ""filler"", under some other name. I don't know how true this is. But people are saying ""omg mercury is deadly"" and thus refusing vaccinations because they think they're being poisoned as a result of doctors being cheap.

Also for YEARS there has been stigma around the link between vaccinations and autism. I don't know how relevant this is, but I don't think there have been any verified studies of vaccinations *causing* autism. 

Anyone feel free to add to or correct me at all. I am not a professional of any kind. When I have kids, I plan to vaccinate them.

**Edit:** Ok, so to be a little more clear, it appears that there was a study years ago linking vaccines to autism, but this was discredited. This is what I intended with the above statement but I wasn't as clear as some other redditors (credit to /u/jalopenohandjob and /u/PavlovsBuzzer for that).

ThirdShiftStocker,wiiu,1391038737.0,"Pikmin 2 is DEFINITELY worth playing if you missed out. That game took everything the first Pikmin did and just *ran away* with it.

It did away with the limited time you had in the first game to collect your ship parts, and puts you on a nice treasure/scavenger hunt to pay off a debt that Olimar's freight company owes. The addition of the underground caves/dungeons really took the cake. You will spend hours (the day timer stops ticking when underground) navigating and finding out where the treasure lies within, not to mention creatures that you don't see in the overworld areas. It was a glorious game.

It's not too different from Pikmin 3- you'll have control over two captains but you'll lack the ""Go Here"" feature that made 3 so much more manageable for me. There will also be a tad more enemies than you're used to. The number of Bulborbs you probably saw doesn't compare to what you'll face in Pikmin 2."

What we currently have from our federal government is an us-vs-them mentality though - where Alberta seems to win at the cost of the other provinces.

But a national strategy would be useful. Instead of just pulling the resources out of the ground and selling them, we should be looking at how every province can value-add to the solution.

For example, Ontario is a huge manufacturing powerhouse and if geared up for oil and gas production equipment could have been a huge asset.

But instead, there's been no focus on helping the country gear up for this and Ontario's been left to fend for themselves.

TheEquivocator,AskWomen,1391038962.0,"&gt;In all modern writing, such as newspapers and journals, the word ""humankind"" is used.

You might like this to be true, but it's not. [Google News returns about 12,000 results for the term ""mankind"", in newspapers today](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;tbm=nws&amp;authuser=0&amp;q=mankind&amp;oq=mankind).

&gt;It is commonly agreed upon that ""mankind"" is a non-inclusive word.

Agreed upon by whom? I don't agree. Most dictionaries (that I've seen) don't agree. I don't doubt that *some* people consider mankind a non-inclusive word, but in my opinion this is a controversy manufactured after the fact: no one thought to argue that ""mankind"" *wasn't* gender-neutral until people began looking for ways to take offense to ordinary language.

I don't say that the term ""human kind"" is *wrong*, mind you. People use it; it's a term. But so is ""mankind"", and I don't believe that there's nearly enough consensus to affirm it ""improper"", as you'd like to.

The cooking is because he sucks at anything that isn't pasta and basic sandwiches. Our laundry is because while he can do his laundry on his own (weekly because he purposely doesn't have a ton of clothes), he will ruin my things because they will shrink or get otherwise mangled. I usually let him make decisions about where we go as a couple because I either don't care or don't want to drag him somewhere he doesn't want to be because he'll get grumpy if he's bored. I can do most of the things I enjoy that he doesn't alone. Sometimes he'll go somewhere with me he doesn't want to go because he knows it's important to me, but if it's not that important, there's no reason to make him suck it up for my benefit. It should be mutually beneficial. I'm indecisive so it's nice when he makes the decisions I don't care too much about. However, when it comes to big decisions we are equals and make them together. If I want to go somewhere specific for dinner, we usually go since it's so rare that I actually care. We're both free to go where we please as long as we check in and make sure we're not inconveniencing one another or leaving them worried about why we aren't home at normal times.

Right now, I'm not sure if modding tech is properly understood as I've only seen a little bit of it done.  What I would suggest is getting the ammo overhaul mod and using guns.  With ammo overhaul you can get guns that have a lot more variety in what they shoot.  For example, I've got a shotgun right now that fires 6 bullets total each time.  two are blue, two are yellow, and two are red.  I'm not sure if the blue and yellow ones actually do anything special, but if red hits, they burn (or at least have a chance to burn) the enemy which makes for a pretty powerful weapon.  blast it with a shotgun, which uses knockback, burn kicks in, dead.

So the city sent out trucks to spread some dirt on the bridges (presumably for traction). F'in dirt! 

They simply do not have any equipment to clear the snow or salt the roads. To make matters worse, most of the time the snow sticks down there only when there's a coating of ice first. So you've got a bunch of people who aren't used to diving on snow sliding around on a bunch of ice with no way to remove it unless you count going to Home Depot and buying 50lb bags of water softener pellets and spreading that shit with a fertilizer spreader).

* [Chihiyafuru](http://myanimelist.net/anime/10800/Chihayafuru): This is a josei title rather than a shoujo, but you'll like it. Don't let the strange concepts of karuta give you pause, as they will explain everything. Plus Chihiya is absolutely beautiful, both inside and out.  
* [Fruits Basket](http://myanimelist.net/anime/120/Fruits_Basket): Seriously? You're missing this? Shame upon you. This is the title that really convinced me that shoujo anime was worth the time for a (too-damn-many) year old man.  
* [Honey &amp; Clover](http://myanimelist.net/anime/16/Hachimitsu_to_Clover): Another josei title that is very heavy on the relationships and extremely heavy on the slice-of-life.  
* [Hanasaku Iroha](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9289/Hanasaku_Iroha): An interesting slice-of-life set in a traditional Japanese inn. No. Not Love Hina. That's something completely different. It's a seinen drama rather than a shoujo romance, but I think you'll enjoy it.  
* [Kimi ga Nozumo Eien](http://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien): Rumbling Hearts is fairly hit-or-miss with people, but it is an extremely interesting shoujo romance that you should try out.  
* [Sakamichi no Apollon](http://myanimelist.net/anime/12531/Sakamichi_no_Apollon): Another josei title, this one is about jazz musicians in the mid-60s. Scored by Kanno Yoko and directed by Watanabe Shinichiro, it is an absolute must-watch.

CVTHIZZKID,3DS,1391039421.0,"I would suggest the XL. The size of the actual console compared to the normal 3DS is not that much larger, maybe an inch larger in both dimensions, and I think it is actually slimmer. The difference in screen size is very noticeable; the regular 3DS screen seems tiny in comparison. As a bonus, the battery life is a lot better too. The only downside is that it's a little more expensive, and also doesn't come in as many neat color options (I'm sure this will change).

The 2DS seems fine if you mainly play at home, but I would imagine the screen would be easily scratched if you used it as a portable device, which is kind of the point. I think it's battery life is a little better than the standard 3DS but not as good as the XL. There's also the matter of losing out on the 3D effect and whether you care about that. Personally, I think it's a gimmick and pretty much always turn it off, for me it just makes things more blurry and gives me headaches.

As a recap, I'd go with the XL unless money is an issue. And if you really can't afford an extra 50 bucks, you might want to reconsider buying a new game console at all.

Work through college and don't be too concerned about going out to the bars.

OR, work in the public sector and transfer your loans to the Department of Education so you can sign up for 10-year loan forgiveness; apply for income-based repayment so you're only paying pennies on your dollar. Your pay might suck during that time, but its a hell of a lot better than repaying the loan in full, and since the remainder is forgiven after 10 years of service, the crazy interest rates don't even matter.

Those are the only rights you have. You're arguing that women have some sort of special right that men don't have. That's bullshit. You're trying to establish that the natural consequence of biology combined with the right to bodily autonomy and the rights of children combine to establish some sort of legal or philosophical concept that privileges women over men.

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1391039531.0,"One thing I learned from the game /r/kerbalspaceprogram is that engines work *better* in a vacuum.  Depending on how they operate, they have a different ISP (Specific Impulse, a measure of the ~~rocket's~~ engine's efficiency in converting fuel into thrust; higher = more efficient) in a vacuum than in the atmosphere.  

Why?  Because in the atmosphere, the air is pushing *inwards* against the blast of hot gas coming out of the rocket nozzle, with a pressure of around 15 pounds per square inch.  

Sure, that's not a lot if you think about that rocket engine you see firing up at the first liftoff, generating thousands upon thousands of pounds of thrust.  But for weaker engines, such as the ones they use when transitioning from the top of the atmosphere into vacuum, or entirely in a vacuum, any air pressure really kills their efficiency.  

KSP players know that the LV-N nuclear engine is superficially based on the real-life [NERVA rocket engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NERVA).  Here are its ISP stats:

* ISP (sea level): 380 seconds (3.7 km/s)
* ISP (vacuum): 850 seconds (8.3 km/s)

So the NERVA is *over twice* as efficient in space as it is on earth.  The Space Shuttle Main engine, called the [RS-25](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Main_Engine), looks like this:

* Isp (sea level) 366 seconds (3.59 km/s)
* Isp (vacuum) 452.3 seconds (4.436 km/s)

So it's about 23% more efficient in a vacuum.

Don't ask me why ISP is measured in either time or optionally speed; it's something I can't explain to myself much less a 5 year old.

ServiceB4Self,technology,1391039555.0,"I've been with T-Mobile since 2008, and my parents had me on their t-mobile plan from 2001-2005, so I've seen T-mobile throughout their ups and downs. Hell, my parents were with Voicestream before that switched to T-mobile (not sure if they got bought by t-mobile, or were the original t-mobile, but whatever)... 
T-mobile has always had EXCELLENT customer service. But, about a year and a half ago, maybe 2 years ago, there was a shift. a disturbance in the force if you will.

I worked in the ATT warranty department for a short while (inbound calls at a call center, pretty boring stuff) and was trained to handle calls in a certain way (not at all like the way T-mobile handles their customer calls). All of a sudden a couple years ago, I started noticing T-mobile's customer service trends were sounding rather familiar. Then I started to hear the rumors that ATT wanted to buy up T-Mobile. I was pissed. I was ready to cancel because I KNOW how badly ATT treats their customers (granted, I did everything in my power to make sure that MY customers got treated, you know, like human beings...) and I was about ready to straight cancel my account. 

Then I guess it was the US Department of Justice that stepped in and put a halt to it, and suddenly T-mobile's stellar customer service came back! Luckily, since I was used to ATT's loopholes and stupid regulations, I was actually able to get 2 months of my bill paid, because T-mobile's employees were being trained to act like ATT employees for a little while there. Or at least, that's the way it seemed. Either way, it worked for me...
and now, ATT is really feeling the hurt. maybe they realized that T-mobile would be this big of a threat that early on, and wanted to acquire it before it was a problem for them? *assimilate! assimilate!*


Tl;Dr: Long time T-Mobile user, was pissed when ATT was going to buy t-mobile, take THAT you ATT bastards!

You've probably got a decent amount of running gear already if you ran Boston 3 years ago. The two big gear purchases you'll need are a wetsuit and a bike, if you don't already have them. I have a BlueSeventy Sprint wetsuit, got it last summer in a hurry for an open water swimming event. It's an OK fit, not perfect - I got a large when I probably should have got a medium/large, and the arms and legs are a little too long for me. Best thing you can do is go to a local tri shop and try on a good variety of them, you might find that Tyr ones are perfect and Orca are a disaster for you, for example. Bike-wise, any basic road bike would be ideal - a low-end new one or a 2-3 year old secondhand one etc. You'll need a helmet too, and proper cycling shoes and clip-in pedals really do help. 

In terms of other gear - trisuits are a very personal choice. They'll save you a lot of time in transition due to not having to change all your clothes, but the pad in the shorts can be smaller than some people would like. "

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391039687.0,"&gt; I noted against your idea that ""elites will just establish a new government"" that this is actually accurate and why we advocate delegitimizing the state and recognizing its crimes as crimes rather than by means of violent revolution to end the state, and noting that this is why it is especially troubling if someone takes the position that ""yeah, it's a crime, but that's okay because for them while it's wrong for everyone else because they're the government and I trust them"".

Okay, fair enough, but at the same time, some of us actually do see legitimacy in the state's actions. You might not agree, which is fair enough, but people actually do think exceptions should be granted on the grounds that society sometimes needs to take special privilege for the greater good. Quite frankly, all I require for an apparent breach in civility is a justified reason for it. 

&gt;After that, I say that to establish a system where one can only gain while promoting the general welfare of others, no government social engineering is needed. All that needs to be done is establish a system where everyone must work with each other with mutual consent so that if people can work for mutual benefit, and if one would only gain at the expense of another, you do not have the consent of both parties. All attempts for one to gain at the expense of another. Essentially, the only way to establish such a system is to adopt Voluntaryism. Any attempt at ""social engineering"" (i.e. tyranny) just allows for one to gain at the expense of another. We support free markets as a consequence of this basic voluntary nature of society, not because of anything inherent about markets themselves. The Soviets tried to play market with their central planning schemes, but without the voluntary basis their prices were meaningless leading them to their chaotic, wasteful planning which ultimately resulted in their end.

This is where we disagree, since the ""voluntary""-ness of free markets is actually highly suspect, since people are basically coerced into participating due to the fact that they are left with no other option but starvation. This leads to exploitation.

I don't support soviet style central planning either, but I believe there is a viable middle ground to be found in advanced democratic states.

Quite frankly, I think to get the best results for all, you need some level of forced social engineering, you might not agree with it, but I deem it necessary. Moreover, I think the very idea of free markets is a social invention. If the state were destroyed, for example, I don't think people would behave morally, and I don't think there would even be a safe environment in which to practice free markets.

&gt;The next point is your idea that what makes something someone's resource is that the government is the one bestowing it upon them from on high, that what is needed for property to exist is ""government and social recognition backed up by the use of force"". This is incorrect. What makes those resources their own to begin with is original appropriation (i.e. homesteading). As to own something means to control it, original ownership necessarily begins with the first person who controls it. From there control may switch hands from one person to another. This may be done either by voluntary consent, as in the cases of charitable gift giving and trade, or it can be done violently, as in the cases of theft and fraud.

This sounds nice in a hypothetical expanding world, like, say minecraft, but is it really practical under a system in which there is limited land, and some ahve some and some don't?

Also, you need to defend your land from ""invaders"", especially because you might own massive amounts that exclude others from a place to live. I think your system has problems in the real world. As I said, sounds great in minecraft, and heck, I use it in minecraft myself in playing with others, but I don't think it's valid in a society such as ours.

&gt;When the use of force is brought in to defend people's property, it is not establishing the existence of property but only defending what already exists. It is only when the use of force is brought in to aggress that the use of force determines who a property owner is. Or as the famous French liberal Frederic Bastiat once said, ""Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws. On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.""

Question, what about those who don't own property? Who have no place to go? What if you buy up massive tracts of land and deny it to others? Land isn't an infinite commodity after all.

&gt;Your assumption that businesses can only be profit driven while government's get to be ""nuanced"" is the chief sign of the arrogance of political science. Government isn't ""nuanced"", people are nuanced. This is equally true of businessmen as it is for politicians, and you shouldn't mistake your simplifications for the sake of model analysis to be an accurate reflection of reality.

I'm actually criticizing the respective systems, not the people. people conform to the systems they find themselves in. Capitalism makes people maximize profits. It's very darwinian in nature, and it's rare for businesspeople to show..you know..empathy. The state is a much more complex and nuanced institution. While in the past it's been all about power, modern states founded on ideals and constitutions and stuff and who represent the people are freer to set their agenda. Order and security is one thing, sure, but I also think social engineering is a valuable function of a society too.

&gt;You also say that you want to live in a world that is secure and safe and complain about the low quality service you are getting right now from the government that you trust so much. We agree, defense should be a high priority on your list. To consistently fight for a safe, peaceful world you need to embrace a system that only believes the proper place of the use of force is in defense and not to aggress against others while also wanting to promote mutually beneficial action while condemning systems where one can only gain at the expense of others as the latter means that we all must ultimately go to war if we don't want to be exploited. Free trade is the truth path to peace, both among men and among nations.

I disagree. Your ideas sound nice in theory, but I don't think they'll pan out in practice. Also, I think capitalism in its natural state is actually highly coercive and exploitative. 

&gt;As for my point on preferring the sadist over the benevolent dictator, I'm not by any means saying that sadism is good, but that I think a sadist is less likely to do as much harm. Someone living parasitically off of the rest of society harms things, but parasites also get full and then leave the thing to go on as it was before. The benevolent dictator however is not simply satisfied with living parasitically off of society, but wants to reshape the world in their own image that they assume can be achieved by their parasitic methods. They are the real threats at destroying the system and to continually hurting someone else above and beyond the amount of pleasure they get from it since they think they mistakenly think they are fighting for the good. I got a real nice C.S. Lewis quote to sum up what I'm saying.

And once again, I disagree? I see capitalism in its natural form as exploitative and parasitic, and largely defended via social structures that legitimize this abuse (hint: property rights in your context is the big thing that justifies it, because you define your terms in ways that make it sound like the rich are the good guys and the poor are the bad guys who want to steal what's ""yours"" and all, even though your system by its nature excludes and exploits them).

&gt;It's also funny that you mention North Korea while you argue why we should trust the state and that we're better off with it than without it. North Korea is a perfect example of how ""nuanced"" a government gets to be when it's not bound by the same laws of everyone else or by profit.

north korea is a dictatorship, not a democracy founded on the ideals that we face. 

&gt;I also find it very strange that you already recognize the only difference between a bandit gang and a government is social acceptability. I was planning on working up to that. I think a good general distinction between what I see the proper place of government (if there is one) and a bandit was made by St. Augustine, the 4th century theologian:

In a sense it is. The people give it legitimacy, and ideally, how the power is used. But hey, we need them to survive. Humans band together to enhance their survival, this leads to groups of people wielding weapons. For me, the key is for these groups to look out for the itnerests of all, and not to become corrupted in creating exploitative systems. I think capitalism is exploitative, but since marxism isn't the answer, the answer is mild forms of social engineering to ""enhance"" it, and harness it for the good of all. And sometimes this does require force. People have different ideas, we can't necessarily all have our cake and eat it too, tough decisions must be made. You might disagree, but the thing is, I really don't think your system is all its cracked up to be. It sounds nice on the surface, but digging deep down its the same old statist crap you despise repackaged in a new form. It gives you the illusion of freedom and voluntaryness, it's not really ""free"". For example, I can't decide to homestead somewhere if all the land is owned. I have to play someone else's game to get sustenance. I have to accept their terms for employment, or screw off and starve. Quite frankly, capitalism, under your terms, reminds me a lot of feudalism, it's just that the king tier is lopped off the hierarchy."

TheLittleGoodWolf,childfree,1391039747.0,"Well if I wanted to insult someone I would probably use something that they were and identified with to produce maximum damage.

Example: I know that she is a lesbian, I also know that there is some social stigma associated with this (be it that she's in a minority group or whatever) and boom, I can use that in an insult. Preferably using a derogatory term if there is one and mixing in a swear word or two. It really has nothing to do with the group she belongs to at all.

If I were to call someone a faggot (can I use the actual word?) that doesn't mean that I dislike gay people in any way shape or form. Perhaps I'm alone in this though but to me every slur is just a slur, whether it be racial, sexist, or whatever else. It's just a swearword and doesn't really have a deeper meaning. Profanities in general are a sign of higher emotional influence and that means that rationality takes a back seat in the conversation. When a person swears or gets upset I try not to read to much into what they are saying until they calm down.

On that note (but only slightly), there is a quote:
&gt;Live with a man 40 years. Share his house, his meals. Speak on every subject. Then tie him up, and hold him over the volcano's edge. And on that day, you will finally meet the man.

'Relevancy' is a big library buzzword these days, and it can get frustrating hearing it over and over again, but I do think it's important to stay relevant to your community and we have to offer more than just books in order to do that. 

I love that we offer great programming at my library, and that members of our community come to see speakers and movies and then leave with their latest book checkouts tucked beneath their arms. I love that we offer computer and technology instruction, because the digital divide is a real thing and people come to us with real needs. I even love that homeless people can come rest their feet while reading Newsweek, because damn is it cold outside! Even so, we always have people reading in our comfy chairs, and we always have people checking out books, music, and movies. I actually think that it's partly *because* we offer those other services that our circulation stats are among the highest in our state, rivaling those of much larger city libraries.

You can lift, but your body type is smaller (like me!) so own it. Love your body and girls will too! If you get a bit bigger from lifting, but still feel awkward about yourself, then you will look it and girls will notice it.

maowsers93,texas,1391040032.0,"The schools in question are charter schools they aren't public schools like you and I think of them. Those schools are teaching straight up creationism and are getting different school books from the list approved by the public schools. I'll have to go look the info back up but they're teaching science on the basis of intelligent design. 

The issue of it being unconstitutional is that back in the mid 90's Texas changed the definition of a charter school so that it was legally a public school. They did that so they could get public funding. They don't teach the ""theories"" they're teaching creationism. I'll look up the examples I've seen and post back here. 

It is also worth nothing that they also favor defunding public schools in various ways including vouchers, tax cuts, etc. which is goes against the state constitution. The Texas constitution states that the state has to fund the public education system adequately. So they're going against to supreme court and the state constitution. 

Teaching any creationism in a science class is unconstitutional. The supreme court has upheld the separation of theology and science twice.[Edwards_v._Aguillard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_v._Aguillard) states that teaching creationism in schools is unconstitutional because it advances a particular religion. As I'm sure we've all noticed schools aren't teaching the Mayan creationism here or giving equal time to the various pagan theories. [Kitzmiller v. Dover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District) directly says that teaching intelligent design is just another way of teaching creationism. So the SC has repeatedly handed down rulings that state the teaching of theology in science classes is against the law. "

However, if you suffer social anxiety, it might not be bad idea to have a cup of something (water, soda, seltzer, etc.) just to give you something to do.

In terms of transportation, you can get by really cheaply and easily. The SeaTac airport has a light rail that goes straight to CenturyLink field and downtown. If you get a hotel downtown you can use public transit to get around the city really easily. If you want to check out bars or places a bit out of town there's ZipCar, Car2Go, and ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft.

JonWood007,Anarcho_Capitalism,1391040291.0,"&gt; Why is that? Would they be guilty? Self-defense is, after all, allowed for by the law, both in the US and by anarcho-capitalists. Aren't liberals supposed to be anti-war, or is that only when the president has an ""R"" after his name?

I fall into neither category, war is justified when deemed necessary and engaged for a good reason. I just think that this is a gross oversimplication of reality.

&gt;We're not talking about a case of manslaughter where someone was killed accidentally, we're talking about someone who purposefully tortured an innocent man. And even if it was an accident, if someone runs into your car accidentally, you still make them pay for damages

This just means the state ashould apologize and pay damages, not that the state should disappear.

&gt;It doesn't by definition. A market is only free when someone has no legal path to infringe against the life, liberty, or property of others.

Except the very definition of markets and capitalism require an environment it's safe to practice such things in, and quite frankly, I'd argue property is a social invention in and of otself. 

Anarcho capitalism is actually very legalistic when you come right down to it. Things are ""voluntary"" because you ""agree"" to them, while I'd argue the system is rigged for instance. You see rich property owners as the good guy while the poor as parasites or invaders, even though the convention of property has left them homeless. Quite frankly, it just sounds like an elaborate illusion to justify the vast riches of rich people, to demonize poor people, and give people an illusion of freedom where there really is none.

&gt;I didn't realize the purpose of the US government was to defend foreign interests above American interests and against your own principles. Unless, of course, you're wrong about what his principles are.

Well, this i just more complexity at work. We have obligations overseas, and we have principles against other states killing their own citizens. Once again, you're ignoring and throwing out a lot of nuance here and viewing things in these ridiculous overly simplistic black and white terms.

&gt;Again, you're giving him not only benefit of the doubt, but denying all evidence to the contrary. What kind of thing would Obama need to do to make you believe he is not actually anti-war and that it's all a fraud? Or is admitting you were wrong and supported a war criminal just that difficult to admit to yourself?

I'm not gonna even respond to this because it's all loaded terms.

May I recommend you take a semester to study international politics?

I mean, really, it would take some long freaking posts to just scratch the surface and untangle this mess.

&gt;If the points are legitimate, it's not a strawman, it's evidence that you're wrong.

yes it is, you're offering grossly overly simplistic views of the world, failing to take into consideration all kinds of nuance.

Uncomfortable,DigitalPainting,1391040357.0,"Looks like MTaylorific dug up the painting you based your composition on. Master studies are a great exercise, but you should definitely cite your reference when posting them online. Not only does it give credit where credit is due, but it also helps people understand what you were trying to achieve better, and allows them to give more appropriate critique.

[I did this paintover](http://i.imgur.com/TVe0pyV.jpg) before I saw MTaylorific's comment, so some elements are now a bit.. moot. But I'll post it anyways, in case it helps. My figures aren't great, so don't pay attention to their poses so much as their placement, scale and value/contrast.

In Jaime Jones' piece, he manages to separate the smaller figures out from their environment by making them quite dark relative to their surroundings.

In terms of the master study, I would recommend trying to replicate Jaime Jones' painting completely, instead of trying to work in your own elements. It'll teach you far more, since you'll be able to better understand the decisions Jaime made, and also if you pay careful attention, you'll be able to understand how he uses simplicity (as opposed to noise and excess detail) to his advantage."

Sunfried,explainlikeimfive,1391040565.0,"Not related to engine efficiency, but it is related to overall thrust efficiency.

Atmospheric friction, aka the drag force, is definitely a consideration, and if improperly throttled too high, a rocket in atmosphere can encounter so much drag it'll lose tremendous efficiency from thrust as more energy goes into pushing air out of the way of the rocket nose.  If you hear them talk about ""MaxQ"" or ""maximum dynamic pressure,"" that's because the rocket has hit that point and must lower the throttle and wait to get higher up where the drag force is lower (as there's less air in the way).

Just as a skydiver has a terminal velocity before they open their chute, they'd have a different, faster terminal velocity if they were thrusting downward, but the air would still resist any additional speed. Rockets have the same issue going up, even if they're very aerodynamic.  "

Miliean,TrueReddit,1391040614.0,"Honestly, I've been employed in various call centers for a period in my live.  Worked on Contracts from banks to newspapers and most things in between.  I worked exclusively inbound, so am familiar with authenticating a user.

When asking a user to authenticate a credit card, a common problem is that the user has more than a few of them and has no idea what one they use.  So we are permitted to tell them the type of card and the final 4 digits.  That information is not considered to be as ""private"" and is one of the only things we can give the caller before everything is authenticated. If you look at online orders (or printed receipts from the store), the full CC is almost never printed.

The final 4 digits and type of card (the first digit) are not secure information the same way a credit card number is.  Its (imo) the second biggest problem with using credit card number as authentication (the first being the minimum wage call center employee who is staring at your credit card number).  

So using that method of authentication is where paypal fucked up.  Not when they disclosed it, it's when they chose to use CC as account authentication. 

Go daddy fucked up by authenticating an account using nothing but a common unsecured bit of information.  That's a MUCH bigger fuck up.  I mean, give this a try.  Go to your email and search for the exact phrase ""Card ending in"" or ""Visa ending in"" or whatever.    I get a large telecom(my provider), an airline(who I fly with often) and many many others.  So that information is sent over email, that's commonly thought of to be unsecure. 

What Paypal did is bad, it's MUCH worse what Godaddy did.  Authenticating an account that poorly, then failing to remedy the situation right away.  Every call center I've ever worked at records every call.  They can check when the account changes were made and at what time and use that information combined with the agent who did it to pull the recording of the call.  It's appalling that they knew their agent fucked up but choose to sit on that information and fuck this guy over. "

PanicOnFunkotron,OutOfTheLoop,1391040676.0,"I'll do the best I can, but wrestling is a story told over years, so going into anything but the basics will have us here all day.

First of all, you have to understand Daniel Bryan. He's the most popular wrestler since probably Stone Cold Steve Austin. [Here's a clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsESZMBJhXw) of a speech having nothing to do with Bryan being overrun with Bryan chants. This happens all the time. The crowd chants for him constantly, regardless of if he's involved with anything that's happening at the time.

So then we get to last Sunday--the Royal Rumble. The main event is the titular battle royale, and the winner gets a guaranteed World Championship match at WrestleMania. Bryan had the first match of the night (against the creepy and enigmatic [Bray Wyatt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwEsCOYCkL8)--I'm a fan) and tore the house down. Really a great match from both men.

So we get to the Rumble match itself, and the crowd doesn't expect, but *knows* that Bryan will be one of the entrants, and he will win, and he will fight for the title at WrestleMania.... except that doesn't happen. Bryan doesn't even make an appearance in the Rumble. The last 20 or so minutes of the pay-per-view was completely drowned out by boos from the crowd, and the eventual winner, Dave Batista, was jeered even though he was supposed to be a fan-favorite. The crowd was also upset with Batista because he'd just returned from a 4-year absence, during which he made it very clear he didn't think highly of wrestling or its fans. 

So anyway, the internet goes apeshit. Mick Foley, one of the nicest and most respected wrestlers of our day, posted an [angry tweet](https://twitter.com/realmickfoley/statuses/427649348693147649), followed by a long rant on his [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/posts/766587886704685:0?stream_ref=1). He even said the word ""fuck"" which is completely out of character for him. He would go so far as to [smash a TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfZVdR6jgvE) to sort of make good on a promise he'd made online. 

And then, yes, today there was the news that CM Punk left the company.

I don't want this to go on too long, but feel free to ask any other questions you might have and I'll do my best. Or stop over to /r/SquaredCircle. We don't bite.

*Just as a bonus, I'll add [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttiGTC5B2gg) from a few weeks ago of Daniel Bryan leaving The Wyatt Family, thereby setting up the match I mentioned earlier.

And while he surely wouldn't like the Foundation's treatment of 590, especially for the rest you mentioned the Foundation is not a prison but a home. 347 is an invisible kleptomaniac who *has* to lead a life of crime outside. They would probably let him take 163 home if it still exists. And as for 134, they are pretty much raising her - they don't not call her Stella because they are cold but because someone referring to her as 134 after calling her Stella upsets her.

ninety6days,ireland,1391040817.0,"&gt;I don't want the 26 county state to expand to take in the 6 counties. That's not the ideal of our party. We want a new country, a 32 county Ireland. Within that country the people can vote as to whether they want an NHS style system and I would certainly advocate that. I'd be the first to admit that the current British healthcare system is better than the HSE. The same scenario would apply for all those bullet points - A united Ireland doesn't mean we have to have all the flaws of the 26 county state, nor those of the 6 county state. It doesn't mean that Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil will implement their past policies. It will be a republic and the people will decide exactly what they want on each of your points.

I think thats idealistic far beyond the naivety threshhold. More further down.

&gt;I don't think the UVF argument adds up either. The last 80 years have been blighted by violence caused by partition. To think that partition keeps everyone safe is a fallacy. I want to see a united Ireland in which the protestant community feels safe and secure, and welcome. I would argue that unionists will have a far greater say in the politics of a united Ireland as they will make up a far more significant section of the population than they do in the 'UK' system.


It's not that partition keeps everyone safe, it's that the status quo is the safest the north has been since partition began. The natural reaction of the hardline unionists will be a campaign of violence wreaked upon the 26 counties as they see them now. This is not something that we can address when it happens (if SF get your way and partition ends), it's something that we need to be prepared for, just as all of the above. We can't just press the big red button and hope the wings don't fall off, y'know?

&gt;I don't want the Good Friday agreement repealed at all. It provides for a united Ireland as long as the people votes for it. I don't foresee any situation in which political prisoners will be returned to jail.

Why would anyone want the united ireland now, when we can't afford it and the the north gains nothing by joining what your party says over and over again is a broken state? I know you said earlier that you want to build a new ireland, but surely that starts by sorting out the territory that's already a part of it? Shouldn't we maybe throw up a lick of paint and put the walls back on before we ask next door over for a cup of tea and to move in??

&gt;On your final point, yes SF are looking at it in great detail and are engaging with communities throughout Ireland, including regular meetings with unionist politicians and community leaders (including former loyalist leaders). We have hosted huge conferences in Ireland, Britain, America and Australia to build support for our ideals and to ensure that the transition towards (what I would see as the inevitable) United Ireland is as smooth and beneficial for all our citizens as possible.

Yeah, cool, and not conferences i've been at (surprised? haaha). But really, the question of whether a united ireland is a good thing must at this point include how to make it happen, and that's not something SF are talking about. I suspect it's because they don't know how to pay for the whole thing OR maintain the quality of life that's currently afforded by being a subject of the UK compared to a citizen of the ROI."

After that, I hopped on here and read some stories of others dealing with similar recoveries to mine. That helped a lot, too (Thanks, guys!)

After chatting with my Sisters-of-Choice, it's very clear that what I need to do is learn how to better recognise these behaviours *in the moment* and alter my reactions to the moments, instead of acting on instinct/anger at my SO's reactions (which I can't control, and are usually the opposite of the conclusions I manage to jump to) and later analysing what I did wrong. Even when I recognise the behaviours, I never manage to get them stuck in my mind enough to acknowledge the patterns as they happen. Only after-the-fact, or if my SO observes it in the heat of the moment and brings it to my attention, which drags me down until I can reconcile its truth.

In the meantime, my closest/oldest Sister-of-Choice has started to help me find low-income counseling in my current city of residence.

The core is so far away from the earths crust that is is virtually impossible that harnessing shallow magma as an energy source would have any effect on the earths core. There are two parts to the core; the outer and inner. The outer being a liquid state and the inner being a solid. Both with slight compositional changes.

Would there be more earthquakes? Honestly there isn't enough known about the affect drilling has on man made earthquakes. 

Oceans become colder? Absolutely not. Again, the earth doesn't have this huge pool of magma right below the crust that can be easily accessed. It is generally isolated due to plate tectonics. There are still hotspots where melt can be generated through rifting etc. "

beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1391040945.0,"&gt;A mother who puts her child up for adoption or drops the child off at a safe haven will not be compelled to pay child support.

You do know that if the father wants the kid, he can take custody and she *will* have to pay custody? Plenty of women pay child support in this country. It's not exactly unheard of.

&gt;The child's supposed ""rights"", once again, are entirely contingent on the mother's choices.

Nah, bro. The rights of children are a custodial agreement. Whomever is their custodian is entitled to support from all other custodians if they don't reside in the same household. So if the parents transfer their custodial rights to the state, they relinquish financial support responsibility. But you can't transfer custodial rights between biological parents, so one is going to be entitled to support (if they want it, it doesn't happen magically or automatically with jack booted thugs). It's almost like the state, children, and parents are separate entities with different responsibilities as far as the law is concerned. If you're getting that impression, it's because they totally are.

&gt;No. I'm saying the laws regarding paternity have yet to catch up with abortion rights.

What part of bodily autonomy do you not understand? There are no paternity rights or maternity rights. Just bodily autonomy and obligation to biological children. You have parental rights too, which are also gender-neutral.

You're trying to establish that the law is not gender blind. It is. There are no underlying assumptions other than the basic facts of biology."

BooksofMagic,TheRedPill,1391040957.0,"I understand what you were getting at, but in your scenario, these girls would only be exposed to a minimal number of potential mates (everyones too shy to meet right?) before choosing, if they could even choose any at all.  Such a society would likely not be able to sustain it's own population without some driving force to get them out there meeting new potential mates.  Without attraction their is less motivation to have sex.

On the other hand, if at sometime in the future, her social circle expanded to include more men, she would then feel herself become attracted to another male if her body agenda determined that he had better genes.  Populations would shoot up as more women found men that they were genuinely attracted to and having more babies with them.

Your hypothetical scenario only works if we evolved traits to cope with being that way."

I was once sitting front of a stranger (guy) at lunch back in middle school. He was in the middle of eating his ice cream when a good chunk of it collapsed on the table. *^(I'm sure y'all should know where this is going)*
 
Well, I had napkins. The person next to him had napkins. Instead of asking for some like a normal human being, he smacks his hand down on the table (note: these tables weren't regularly cleaned and when they were cleaned, they used a dirty rag). He smears his hand across the table, picking up the ice cream in his palm. After that, he sucks on his hand, slobbering like a pig.
 
He repeats the earlier action, with the exact same hand, scooping up the leftover ice cream and once again, slobbering to suck it up. Ice cream covers his entire mouth and nose. Now there's a puddle. He desperately attempts to scoop up the reminiscences. 15 seconds of struggle and he succeeds. Slobber on the table. Slobber on his hand. Slobber down his chin. Ice cream on nose. Ice cream around mouth. He's done, right? Nope.
 
He musta suspected some was on his face and wiped **THAT. SAME. HAND.** over his face and ""cleaned up"". That scarred me for life. Especially since it was ice cream I loved to eat. I thought slobs like that didn't really exist in MS. That proved me wrong (ironic enough, some time later, I met another dirty person, but we actually befriended).

Fuck, this sounds really weird to say, but I'm still really afraid of vacuum cleaners. Not the vacuum cleaner itself, but the sound one makes almost causes me to have an anxiety attack. Because I remember when I was younger, I'd hear her turn it on and knew she was coming for my room. Which meant everything was getting vacuumed up, didn't matter what it was. Small toys on the floor? Gone. She always started with my room, never asked me to clean it myself (unless she'd already cleaned it), she'd just turn the vacuum on and barge in with it. She'd ""clean"" my room when I was away, too. I'd come home to shit missing all the time.

If my personal experience is to be trusted, this game should be relatively bug-free.  It has already been out for a while so there should be no issues.  Just look at Metal Gear Rising on PC.

wiseblueberry,Assistance,1391041494.0,"You can apply for financial aid to go to college.  I am assuming you are in the US, and will advise you as such.  Since you are under the age of 24, unmarried, no kids, etc, you are a ""dependent"" student and your mom is technically supposed to sign your application.  If she will not sign your application, your school can still award you unsubsidized loans without a parental signature, but they begin to accumulate interest immediately, so if you can get your mom to provide her income information and sign your FAFSA, it will likely be better for you.  When asking her, just reinforce that you are not asking her to cosign a loan, you are not asking her to borrow Parent PLUS loans, you are just asking her to provide her income information to allow you to qualify for subsidized loans, which don't accumulate interest while you are in school and maybe even a Pell grant.  If she absolutely won't give the info, you have the option to pursue unsubsidized loans.

Obviously, there's the matter of getting to and from school, do you live in an area with public transportation?  Do you live close enough to a college to ride a bike/walk?  If not, you may need to look into getting your Driver's License.  There is nothing stopping you from looking up the DMV website wherever you live and studying the laws in your state to be able to take the written test.  Some states don't require a written test once you reach the age of 18, but I don't know where you are.  You will need to take a road test, and you will need to provide a vehicle for the test.  If your mother won't allow you to use hers, do you have a friend who would loan you theirs just for the test?

Once you have your license, you can look into getting a vehicle.  Try getting a job somewhere within public transit/walking distance until you save up enough.  There are also some ways to make a little money online /r/beermoney, /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor, /r/mturk but it would take a while to accumulate enough to buy a car.  Your best bet is to find a job, even part time will get you something.

And once you are able to go to school, make sure you are going for something that interests you and hopefully leads to a career.  Don't rule out trade schools as an option.  Typically the programs are shorter and many help with job placement upon graduation.  If you want to go the path of traditional college, do your first two years at a community/junior college, then transfer to a university to finish your bachelor's degree.  You'll save a lot of money.

Just remember, your mother's expressed faith/lack of faith in you does not determine your actual ability to get stuff done.  You can do everything I have listed here, you just have to take it one step at a time."

Domination obviously involves directly competing with other civs, diplomacy requires competing with others for the affection of city-states (and sometimes trying to win the votes of other civs), time directly compares you to others. Culture's not nearly as interactive as those three, but you still need to establish trade routes, open borders, throw diplomats around, trade great works and sometimes go to war against people who you can't turn peacefully.

Science on the other hand just involves sitting there spamming next turn for a few hundred turns until you win. Research agreements do help, but they require only the bare minimum amount of interaction with other civs and are only needed on higher difficulties. Science is the only victory condition you could achieve without ever meeting any other civs, and that does make it feel pretty boring (to me at least).

That being said, I'm not sure how to change the science victory to make it more interesting. Overwhelming the science of others would work from a gameplay perspective, but it doesn't really make any sense - I have better science so I am declared the winner? It's a bit odd. Actually I was thinking that the game might be better off if science victories were removed entirely. It'd be killing a sacred cow, they're been around in the series since forever, but science is already the do-everything magic power that makes your empire powerful and enables every other victory condition, do you need any more encouragement to have good science?

wordserious,explainlikeimfive,1391041677.0,"Others have explained why it's used in computers, but here's my take on the first part of your question:

1. Binary code is just computer programs encoded in a way that computers can access directly. Code here is not used in the same sense of a secret code.
2. An overly simplified way of seeing it is: computers only operate on numbers. Numbers are assigned to letters. By convention, A = 65, B = 66, etc. There are also numbers assigned to things like punctuation, end of line, and other specific things.
3. The easiest way to encode numbers so that computers can use them directly is by using the binary system, or base 2. We are used to base 10, or decimal system, where there are 10 possible numbers, from 0 to 9 and after that we start using positions. After 9 comes 10, which is 0 preceded by 1, and so forth. In binary there are only two numbers: 0 and 1. So counting from 0 to 10 in binary looks like this:

Decimal | Binary

0 | 0

1 | 1

2 | 10

3 | 11

4 | 100

5 | 101

6 | 110

7 | 111

8 | 1000

9 | 1001

10 | 1010

Do you get it? Just like 112 decimal = 1 x 100 + 1 x 10 + 2 x 1, 1001 binary = 1 x 8 + 0 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 9. Decimal is base 10, so it uses positions to represent multiples of 10 (1, 10, 100, 1000), while binary is base 2, and uses multiples of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8).

One switch in a computer, which can be 0 or 1, is called a bit. By convention, computers work with groups of 8 bits, which make a byte. 8 bits can form any number from 0 (00000000) to 255 (11111111). So to store the letter A, a computer needs to store the number 65 (these numbers were assigned arbitrarily by convention). 65 decimal = 01000001. So when you type A, what actually gets stored in some place in the computer's memory is this particular sequence of 0s and 1s.

The reality is a bit more complicated than this, things have changed with globalization and the need to represent other alphabets, etc., but this is the simple way I know to explain it."

But what you are correct about: a *single* continuous consciousness that changes from moment to moment. The material body and material experience are one of the aggregates that is constructed around the mind stream, giving the illusion of self by having a reference point to discriminate against perceived phenomena. Upon dissolution of the material body, the stream aggregates another. But the stream is a stream that consists of many moments. A lifetime is only a fraction of that stream. And each moment is itself distinct from every other moment, causally connected through a process of cessation and conditioned arising.

But high school sausage fests were a perilous place. Slip up once and you'll definitely lose a lot of social standing. It sounds so fucking shallow now, but I was fairly popular and concerned with that sort of bullshit back in high school (wish I hadn't been). Girls in that group called the shots, but a lot of how they chose to shun and allow other girls was tied into their perceived value to men. It was fucking weird as hell when you think about it.

To this day, I have two friends that won't talk to each other, or go to the same parties. It's all because one broke up with a dude that was both of their friend.

ninety6days,ireland,1391041848.0,"&gt;Your concerns are fair and need to be looked at but you still talk about fixing this bit of Ireland like it's preparing to take on new territory. Again this is about a completely new country and fixing all 32 counties on the island.

Whether it's an addition to the existing state or a totally new republic, the biggest change will be for those in northern ireland as they'll be the smaller, absorbed territory in terms of population. We can both dance around it, but that's what we're looking at here. As your party is the one proposing this merger, I think it's fair to ask how you overcome the obstacles presented.  Like you say: 

&gt; You have pointed out some potential obstacles to unity and we need to prepare for them. 

Anyway. I don't expect a rural councillor to know what i don't expect the ruling committee to know, and maybe it's unfair to ask. On we go...

&gt; 2 currencies on this island severely hampers the economy Businesses in this region are held to ransom by the buoyancy of one currency so we have swings and roundabouts by which business go up and down as the sterling or euro strengthens or weakens. 

And the solution is to join the weaker one, that arguably hampers the continental economy by preventing devaluation in times of recession? The IMF bailout that SF so heartily railed against wouldn't have happened if we weren't part of the Euro..

&gt;It also doesn't make sense to have 2 healthcare systems, educational systems, civil services etc and the duplication of bureaucracy that comes with that.

True, but will those in the north be better off as part of (what i listed above as almost unquestionably) the weaker option in every case? Because if not, i think it's fair to THEM to show them that we HAVE put the walls back up, you know? They're going to see themselves as the absorbed minority, and if you look over the border at the fucking state of our public services it doesnt exactly advance the republican cause, does it?

&gt;Cross border crime is more difficult to tackle because we have 2 police services. My community is ravaged by burglaries because criminals feel they can escape over the border with ease before one police force informs another. 

Yeah, I can see the logic there, but again I ask whether the PSNI or the GS is the more effective force, and if the answer isnt irrefutably the GS (which it isnt necessarily) then it just makes partition the easier pill for many people.

&gt;The points you have made are fair but the debate is much wider than just that.

Absolutely. So let's have it :) Seriously though, all the issues you raised specifically point to the awkwardness of having a border nearby, which is something every other european country has learned to deal with - why then should we tear down the border? I think it STILL comes back to an idealist desire on the part of some that haven't actually examined the practical, and i'm afraid nothing you've said above has convicned me otherwise.

There are two problems with this: one, just because you wish to dodge responsibility doesn't mean you should work against other women who are comfortable being a voting member of their household.

jaynay1,leagueoflegends,1391042251.0,"&gt;Sorry, I didn't check your comment history before responding to you. That'd only serve to give you evidence for an ad hominem argument, would it not? In a structured debate, that's pointless.

Yes it directly addresses your ad hominem argument of ""Have you ever been on the internet before?""

Since people here clearly don't know how to debate it's not like I can crap on arguments using actual debate so I have to address ad hominem arguments ridiculous though they are.

&gt;Your argument was that Frost have not become any worse at 5v5. The death of 5v5 is a part of that (for which you provide good reasoning, if not any actual evidence) but you provide no evidence for the claim itself (that other teams have improved, rather then Frost getting worse). I'm not saying you should, it's only an internet discussion after all, I just think it's odd to accuse the other guy of not providing evidence when you didn't either.

This is an issue in terms of the style of debate I come from, in which that would be an acceptable tactic -- creating something with an apparent link and warranting that.  He failed to actually address that link.  If you'd like to, I'd love to have that discussion with you, because it's an intentional gap that I left waiting for there to be an actual discussion on it.

&gt;Upvotes/downvotes don't matter man. I didn't say you should be downvoted, I just said that coming across as a douchbag = losing the argument in a lot of people's eyes. Not my eyes. I don't think anyone won or lost, because it's subjective as shit and there is no rational way in which. I don't care whether the votes say you 'won' or he 'won'. It doesn't matter.

I didn't say that either.  The problem is that I'm being perceived as a douchebag when the douchiest thing that happened here is his refusal to actually debate or discuss.  As for ""subjective,"" yeah, that's a reason a lot of debate rounds have split decisions on voting.  But in this case, it would be quite clear from a debate standpoint.  Fact-wise, again, I could be completely wrong here, but I would've debated circles around that guy.

&gt;We are talking about measuring the combined skill of 5 separate people at an undefined point in the past at playing a certain aspect of LoL, with the skill of another 5 people (some of whom remain) at the present, in a very similar but also quite different game. It's absurd to think that you can be 'right'. Sports exist today due to the fact that 'skill' inherently cannot be quantified. If we could measure skill accurately, we wouldn't need tournaments. If a game was simple enough that someone's skill at said game could be accurately defined, that game would be pretty dull for both players and spectators.

&gt;So we make observations subjectively, and we try to see patterns within those observations. Many, people agree on. SKT T1 K are the best, almost everyone agrees. It's subjective, though, so you can't be 'right', even in such a clear-cut case.

&gt;With something vague like ""degree to which Frost's decline is due to their deterioration at teamfighting relative to other teams"" it just baffles me that you think you have drawn the 'correct' conclusion, and others haven't.

This doesn't really feel relevant.  If you mean it to say that there can be no ""right"" that's fine, except my argument this whole time (At least as it refers to the debate portion) isn't that I'm right from a LoL standpoint, but from a debate standpoint.  There's a freaking gaping hole in my argument.  You saw it.  I want someone to address that because that's the fun part of debate.  But just floundering around repeating himself providing no evidence or actual rebuttal is just boring.

_TIXCY_,raisedbynarcissists,1391042268.0,"&gt; First of all, I hope you've found a way to cope with both the abuse you suffered and the awful things mother put you through. I commend your brother for trying to stick up for you in that moment and hope that you two have a healthy and strong relationship. I also hope that you're as far away from your mother as possible.

Therapy and having other family members who understand how my mom is has been amazing. And finding this subreddit. I spent so much of my life thinking I was the crazy one, I was the bad person, that when someone finally told me that my mom might be narcissistic (or have some mental disorder) that I almost lost it. It felt so freeing to not constantly be terrified like that. 

My brother was the GC, I guess. He didn't feed into it like some do, and took the blame for a ton of shit I did just so I wouldn't get in trouble. I spilled pink hair dye on the rug in my bathroom once, he poured bleach all over it and swapped it for the one in his bathroom. Mom bought him a new one and was just all, ""Oh, accidents happen, no problemo!"" and never even questioned why he'd spilled bleach on it in the first place.  

&gt; I also have to say, what your mom did with the vinegar...very disturbing. The whole incident is disturbing, but there's a certain level of thought that goes into pouring vinegar and hot water on someone's wounds. It just kinda makes me sick to think about that, especially mother to child. I'm so sorry for that and everything else she's done. I hope you stay as far away from her as you can for as long as possible.

I *think* the hot water might have been to wash out the vinegar because she was kind of afraid after it happened that it would get infected or something, because she'd ask me how they were and say, ""We can't afford another bill, and I don't want people knowing about this. No one would like you if they knew what you did to this family."" 

But thank you. That means a lot to me. It's really sad that so many people have apologized *for* her and she's never once apologized for anything she's done."

I also add some cayenne and sriracha, because I enjoy some heat. Garlic powder and coriander go well also. Consider a packet of splenda if you want a hint of sweet. You know, just play around with it.

That's right, a popular musician made a song that's popular. Obviously racism and/or the patriarchy is at work here.

Red Pillers are subscribers to the subreddit /r/TheRedPill, which claims to articulate a method of resisting the pernicious influence of feminism and reclaiming men's dominant place in society. By using the name ""red pill,"" users are implying that they've ""woken up"" from the fever dream of feminism and become enlightened.

TRP's philosophy is based largely on outdated ideas of ""Alpha"" and ""Beta"" structuring of animal groups, on misrepresented or overblown findings in evolutionary biology research, and on sexist assumptions about men's and women's motivations. TRP tells men that women like to ride the ""cock carousel"" and are incapable of being faithful or having feelings other than pure lust. It encourages subscribers to be ""Alpha"" by using strategies such as negging (insulting a woman until she feels like she should defend herself against you, thus getting her to talk to you) to have sex with women.

You will see charts on blockchain.info that show the increasing difficulty.  Difficulty is increased on purpose such that a new block is verified and an incentive rewarded every 10 minutes. But, a second reason difficulty is increased is to give incentive to loan as much power to the network as you can muster because it increases your chance of mining the block and getting the reward.  Now, if some hacker who has rooted the computers of 1000's of grandma's around the world decides to spam the blockchain with false transactions, the horde of miners with high end computing rigs can see that spam, identify it as spam, and throw it out as garbage without suffering a disruption to the network.

Why should the government take such notice of one type of business (sports entertainment) and not others? It's all BS and Thomas didn't play along. Good for him.

Regarding taking the year off. Everything I've heard is that he was burnt out - physically, mentally. He's an old(er) guy who had a beast of a season. As an athlete he's not going to admit that he was wiped out, but he was. Whether the move was good for his career, only history will tell. Probably not, but who can say what he'd have looked like if he tried to play last year?

I think this may have had more with the fact that without a man, most women would have had no livelihood. All of their wealth, status and any hope of survival depended on a man so it made getting divorced less popular. However, now that all of that dependence upon men isn't as necessary, I think that divorce isn't as catastrophic as it once was. 

Then again, with that said, this probably led to marriage being taken less seriously since it all seems so fleeting now. If you don't ""need' the one you're with, you don't have to put much effort in waiting to make sure the person is right for you to marry. "

The security and production and use of fiat money also has costs and use resources that could be used on other things, and as /u/snaaky mentioned, think of all the times governments have abused their currencies sending their economies into wild recessions and/or depressions; imagine all of the wasted economic and natural resources during those times. Digital currencies not tied to a nation defer that risk.

All in all, the debate over whether digital currencies are good for the world economy or not is ongoing, but I think your line of thinking should be that mining is not simply conversion (a ""transfer cost"" in economic terms) but is providing a service in the form of facilitating use of the currency.  And due to the nature of the tip, how it naturally achieves a sweet spot to not flood the market with miners but also not have a big dearth of miners, mining for these currencies will only consume more power as the currencies themselves become more prevalent.

And, of course, if energy use grows beyond the supply of energy, we will see energy prices increase, which, though negatively affecting all energy users, will punish the high energy users (the miners) the most, which will make mining less lucrative from a cost/benefit perspective, which will mean there will be fewer of them, which will make energy prices and usage return to the new (albeit higher, on both counts) equilibrium."

When someone says this star is 100 light years away they are basically saying it takes light (which travels at 300,000 km/second or 186,000 mi/second) from that star, 100 years traveling at that speed to reach us. 

Meaning that some of the stars you can see in the sky might not even exist anymore. They may have died 10,000 years ago but it has taken their light so long to reach earth that we are only finally seeing the light they emitted 10,000 years ago. 

So even if that star has died, we can only see it as it was 10,000 years ago because it is so far away."

I really doubt that. I've worked with engaged couples before (I used to give tours at this hall that was popular for wedding receptions), and it was not uncommon for the men to be involved. I always thought it was nice when both parties were interested. 

&gt; My husbands handles all financial and house related issues (bills, mortgage, outdoor upkeep etc). When people find out, they FREAK out and try to tell me this and that about a strong independent woman. 

Doubt that, too. If you're not good at finances, it makes sense for the other party to take care of that stuff. This is not uncommon.

mmp31,politics,1391043155.0,"&gt;why is it a signal of being worth 1.5 times min wage? could it be his work goes from being valued at supply/demand to being valued relative to min wage? what i'm saying is if there is, say, a 50% increase in min wage, its not like all waged workers are going to see a 50% increase as well. if min wage gets raised to 10.10, its reasonable to assume all wages previously at or below 10.10 will raise proportionally to the increase in min wage. but after that, the proportion will go down. not everyone will see a wage increase of 50% (using my previous example).

Assuming all things equal (meaning the supply and demand of the average minimum wage job and say, a starting Electrical Engineering position, doesn't change), they would adjust upward by the same percentage, given enough time.

For example, the average starting EE salary in 1995 was $36,049, which is $55,104.11 in 2013 dollars: http://www.postsecondary.org/last12/401095Salary.pdf Today, the median salary of a starting EE is $63,245: http://www1.salary.com/Electrical-Engineer-I-Salary.html  That's a 
14.77% real increase. In 1995, minimum wage was $4.25/hr, which is $6.50/hr in 2013 dollars. Today, minimum wage is $7.25/hr, which is an 11.53% real increase.  As you can see, the real wages of both examples have adjusted upwards by approximately the same percent increase over the last couple decades.

And yes, I know I was comparing average starting EE salary in 1995 to median starting EE salary in 2013, but I suspect the mean and median are not too far apart that it would significantly distort the results.

&gt;ok index it every year. include cost of living adjustments too every few years.

So you get 14% inflation one year like we did in the early 1980s, that means the poor's incomes are going down by about 1% per month on average.  Not a viable solution for people that can barely feed themselves.

&gt;one thing that resonated with me in the SOTU last night was the POTUS saying something along the lines of ""we need to stop being against things and start being for things."" it seems you are against a min wage increase. how do you suppose we fix the problem of full time workers needing govt assistance to live (aka taxpayer money subsidizing corp profits). i don't think a raise in min wage will solve the problem of income inequality by any means. i think it solves the problem i just mentioned and is a start toward income equality

I think first of all we need to target a zero percent inflation rate, or at the very least, legalize Free Banking so the poor have the freedom to choose alternative currencies that won't inflate away their wages. Then we need to abolish minimum wage and the welfare system entirely and replace them with Milton Friedman's progressive Negative Income Tax System that guarantees a minimum level of income for all."

My party does not do gold as bonuses, they feel it can get too unfair too quickly for people that are better at roleplaying than others, whereas the exp chunks are usually small enough only to be feel-good bonuses."

""Right? How have we not noticed that before?""

""I guess we're usually focused on other things.""

My back was against the warm, flat rock that tilted at just the right angle to lean against. I felt the weight of Natalie's head on my shoulder, and tried to shrug downward to make it more comfortable.

""Sorry I'm so bony,"" I said.

""Like I care.""

I let out a small sigh and sifted through my mind for something to say - school, family, funny little stories from our day. None of our usual topics really seemed to fit the bill for the situation. 

She broke the silence. ""What do you think it'll feel like?""

""No clue. You always see documentaries about these things and what they do to cities. I guess no one's around to describe how it felt.""

She let out the sharp breath through her nose that she made when something amused her, but not enough for a full-on laugh. 

I felt her body shift as she turned over and pecked me on the cheek. ""I'm glad you're with me."" She paused for a moment. ""I mean, obviously I wish you were somewhere else and survived, but, like, if you had to be here..."" 

I started laughing at her. ""Thanks,"" I said in an exaggerated sarcastic tone.

""Fuck you, you know what I mean."" She had turned back over so I couldn't see her face, but I knew she was smiling.

A few seconds passed before I spoke again. ""Remember our first kiss?""

Another sharp breath. This time I could see her grin in my peripheral vision. ""You hit my nose."" I felt her abdomen tighten as she played it back in her head and giggled. ""Such an awkward human being,"" she managed between breaths.

""Yeah, well, you're dating him.""

""And look how well that turned out."" I appreciated her twisted sense of humor, but that did kind of bring us crashing back into the moment. Good timing, I suppose, as I saw the light flicker over the horizon.

There wasn't anything left to say. For the first time, neither of us could lighten the mood. She turned over again and softly kissed me on the lips, lingering a bit longer than usual before she pulled back and stared into my eyes.

""I don't really want to look.""

It is good to be honest. But that doesn't mean you tell her all your reasons.  Don't attack her as a person by pointing out all her flaws. You can really damage her self esteem. If in doubt, use generic statements that are about the relationship and not her. And there are reasons that fall into a grey area between attacking her flaws and being really honest. For example I told a girl that I was breaking up with that I felt like she saw me as a father figure as well as lover and I didn't want that.  I wasn't saying, this sucks about you, but I wasn't saying she sucked.  I've always leaned toward telling grey area reasons. But you will need to make your own judgement call  "
beanfiddler,SubredditDrama,1391043567.0,"Lol. I remembered when I ""played"" at bisexual in high school for attention. Sady Hawkins junior year I wore a fairly slutty dress (more like mini skirt and suspenders and tube top) to a school dance, and invited my best friend because we were both dateless.

We spent the entire dance with our hands all over each other and dancing really close. The guys seemed to like it -- the chaperones, not so much.

And then I freaked the fuck out because I got home and realized, on some instinctual level, that I wasn't actually playing and would have not had said no to making out in the bathroom, maybe more (high school is so romantic).

And that was the end of my bisexual image. It's not really a fun image to cultivate if you're not faking it. So turbo denial mode from then on out.

Here's a funny story: a ton of the people I knew who acted over-the-top straight (like trying to take pictures up my skirt in the hall as a ""joke"") turned out to be really gay. Like Kinsey 6 gay. Including me. All the ones that played at bisexual turned out to be straight.

Movement by 3rds feels like you're outlining the chord or extending the chord. A ii7 has all the same notes as an IV chord.

Movement by 5ths feels like a leap (think the first leap in Twinkle Twinkle little star).

Movement by 2nds feels more like melody (think of every other piece of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star).

If you think of movement by thirds as extending the chord, then movement by 2nds is related to movement by 4ths, in which case there are only two types of movement. By 3rds (within the chord) and 2nds (to the notes that are not in the chord.

As you may know, turtles get large. 150 gallons is the lower limit for two adult sliders, I just happened to find a bargain on this slightly larger aquarium on craigslist. For these animals, such a setup is no means superfluous or notable even at this size.

 Since my setup will be hi-tech, it will be filtered via a high powered sump. The sump belonged to the old owners, and they are emailing me the specs tonight. 

Although I have grown up with aquariums and am a seasoned fish keeper, a tank this large is a true challenge for all except professionals. I'm leaning on the side of caution (8-12 week ""no turtles or large fish"" period in order to get used to the components and let the bacteria levels establish themselves) and doing my homework even before I pick up the tank on Sunday afternoon.

I walk out the door and hear someone talking behind me. I didn't think much of it until I got to my car and heard this woman relaying my tag number over a walkie. I turned around like, ""Uh, can I help you?!""

They told me that if I dropped the stolen item now, they wouldn't press charges.

I stormed back into the store and dumped the contents of my enormous purse on the floor in the middle of the foyer. They snatched up my dead grandmother's kerchief that I always carried with me and compared it to their stock. They determined I hadn't stolen anything, and I asked, ""Are you satisfied now?""

Dogeillionaire 1,000,000-Moon


To Answer OP with an arbitrary value. If you have a few thousand 4-9k you are sitting well above most poor-shibes.  I vouch for my values based on probability of people having a decent rig. Any gamer with a 760, 770  or 7870, 7950, R9 270x etc can mine a decent amount - early adopters passed 100k. Anyone who is serious about Doge and has a legit mining rig can be around 500k-1mil. CPU  miners on 3 year old laptops that push 10khash may have 250 Doge.
  
  
  
  
edit: TL;DR The answers will vary wildly because some people own a mining rig with 5x 270x and others mine on their old gaming 660ti. Others CPU mine. These people will have like.. 500k, 50k, or 5k accordingly."

So the top freezes and the bottom stays warmed by the ground/soil. That's probably the likely ""easy answer"".

There is also another answer though. Ice floats because it's less dense than liquid water. So you've got this sheet of ice on top of water that's creating pressure. One of the weird things about water is that the more compressed it gets, the more energy it requires to freeze, thus the freezing point gets lower. So you basically have this sheet of ice compressing the water underneath and preventing it from freezing.

What if Nowtzki got seriously injured after 07?  Wouldn't you remember back to back times where his team was embarrassed in the playoffs?  Would his legacy be regular season stud and playoff choker?  Fair or not, that'd be a tough reputation to shake

What about if Garnett got stuck in Minnesota or never made it to a team with other studs? Would his legacy be any better than any other good player with bad teammates?  

We remember players differently when they get championships.  Webber should have had one but had it stolen by extremely shady officiating.  If he wins a ring, he's no longer Chris Webber, the talented guy who never could put it all together.  He's Chris Webber the Finals MVP who had an absolutely killer team.

She's depressed, she recently had a traumatic experience, you two are having communication problems.  Why didn't she tell you about the miscarriage?  That sounds like a deeper problem to me.  A partner is supposed to be someone you share everything with, someone who is there for you when you need them the most.  But she didn't tell you about something that serious, and that tells me something is very wrong.

Either way, it sounds like she needs therapy.  Sex is just another stressor for her right now, which is why it's not enjoyable for her.  She needs to work out some of her problems, and you both need to work on your relationship primarily, and working on sex will be easier after that."

TrebelTrouble98,AskWomen,1391044286.0,Hi! You sound like you subscribe to the red pill ideologies. I'd love to hear some of your viewpoints. Care to elaborate on why you disagree?
mmp31,politics,1391044287.0,"&gt;A straw man argument? Really? Here's your direct quote:

&gt;Jobs and higher wages are the result of economic prosperity, not the cause...

&gt;This was the very employment cause and effect implication you were making.

The phrase ""higher profitability"" appears nowhere in the quote of mine you referenced.  So no, I was not making that point, or even implying it.

&gt;What ""prices"" are you referring to (I took that to mean consumer prices) and what downstream economic effect did you have in mind?

Prices in the economy.  If prices are dropping rapidly relative to wages due to technological advancement and productivity increases, what was considered not a decent wage might be considered a decent wage.  For example, if suddenly all prices in the economy drop by a factor of 10 relative to wages, then suddenly somebody who was making $7.25/hr minimum wage (not a decent wage IMO) is effectively now making $72.50/hr, which is very decent IMO.  So my point is that what constitutes a ""Decent"" wage is relative, because it depends on what prices are doing relative to wages, AND your opinion.

&gt;Two reasons. First, it would eliminate the threat to the national economy by marginalizing the economic impact any TBTF institution poses. Second, it would invigorate local economies around the nation by focusng investment where it needs to be focused instead of the commodity speculation and market manipulation seen today. 

How would it do those things?

&gt;Wall Street investment activity has been focued on the developing world, NOT in rebuilding the U.S. since before the financial crisis struck. That hasn't changed. Evidence of that ugly truth is found in the developing world market spasms from Fed. QE tampdowns.

I'm not disagreeing with you here, but do you have a source so that I can read more about this?

&gt;I don't dispute the prominent influence that Fed monetary policy has in fostering or diminishing inflation. I merely disagree that it is the sole influence as you appear to believe.

Inflation is the result of the Fed allowing the money supply to change at a higher rate than the economy is changing.  If the Fed did not want that inflation to happen, it could pull back on MB.  That is the point I'm making."

All of the guys in the office (as well as myself, not a guy) were telling her to go for it. There's nothing wrong with her asking him out. It doesn't make her seem clingy or needy for just asking a genuine question. If you want to go out with him, just ask. You have nothing to ~~ask~~ edit: lose.

But the one other girl who was involved in the conversation said no, she should wait because he's the guy and he should ask her out. If she asks him out he won't like it because she's being to forward and unladylike. Meanwhile all of the guys and I are saying ""No, no! That's not true! It makes no difference! If anything he will think it's cool that she asked him out! Ask him out!""

She didn't listen to the majority and went with what the other girl's suggestion. But really, stop playing games and just be straightforward. You want to ask someone out, ask them out.

SpectreSC,allthingsprotoss,1391044481.0,"4 gate is the most basic build because it only involves putting 1 tech structure down (Cyber Core) and all you have to do is chrono Warpgate research and spam units for victory. This is a good build to learn about executing a basic plan (attack at x time and either win or lose) and you can see immediate results as you get closer to optimizing the build (you attack sooner, enemy has less units, your attack is stronger, your money is lower.)  
  
3 gate robo is more versatile while still being a strong allin or expand option. You can choose to pump units out and attack or delay a warpin, expand and be safe from many aggressive options that your opponent can use. The main crux of the expansion side of this build is scouting. Choosing Observer or Immortal first can mean the difference in surviving or dying to fast DTs or an enemy 4 gate.  
  
The choice is up to you. However, I would advocate for 4gate for a completely new player. Knowing and executing a proper 4gate can net you wins even in Masters. You also get the experience of optimizing a build and knowing what it looks and feels like. 3gate robo is an excellent stepping stone to start playing more 'macro' focused games, and has more leeway for experimentation and adaptation. Eventually you can start trying new builds until you find one that meshes with your playstyle, but these 2 builds can serve as valuable training for you by teaching you basic but extremely important concepts."

    ""It's better to be silent and appear the fool, than to speak and remove all doubt""

If I encounter a troll in the wild though, all bets are usually off. I've gladly sacrificed some positive karma in an effort to kill off said troll, and chances are I'll do it again just as cheerfully."

Aezjeck,Iowa,1391044538.0,"Olde Main Brewery in Ames!

Back Pocket Brewery in Coralville!

Granite City Restaurant and Brewery in Cedar Rapids!

And while in Cedar Rapids, check out Parlor City!

Also, make a visit to Cedar Ridge vineyard and distillery.  You really can't go wrong with anything there.  If you like whiskey, also make a detour to Templeton.  Home of Al Capone's favorite rye whiskey!

Peace Tree Brewery in Knoxville.  (If they have their Cornucopia, get that!)

Man, I love Iowa beer.

edit:  I should mention Parlor City doesn't brew anything, but they have a good selection/atmosphere/food.  Great local hangout."
